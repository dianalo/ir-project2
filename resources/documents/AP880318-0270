(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A study using ultrasonic heart scanscalled echocardiograms has found that people with an enlarged leftside of the heart are two to three times as likely as others tohave a heart attack or stroke, researchers said Friday.   The defect, called left ventricular hypertrophy, has previouslybeen associated with congestive heart failure. But this is thefirst time it has been identified as an independent risk factor forstrokes and heart attacks, said Dr. William Castelli, who presentedthe findings at a meeting of the American Heart Association.   ``The size of your left ventricle is going to be the price youpay for high blood pressure and overweight,'' Castelli said. ``Thatshould be recognized now as a powerful risk factor. It's aspowerful as cholesterol, blood pressure and smoking, and indeed inthe short term it's even slightly more powerful than some of thosetraditional risk factors.''</TEXT><DATELINE>GENERAL SANTOS CITY, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Millions of Asiansprayed, pounded drums, and danced in the streets Friday to greettotal eclipse of the sun that drew a four-minute curtain ofdarkness across land and sea.
