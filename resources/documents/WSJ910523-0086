The $291 billion defense authorization bill also wouldincrease pressure on U.S. allies to boost defense spending,and for the first time it would allow female pilots to engagein combat. The House action sets the stage for a battle inthe Senate, which is expected to take up its version of thebill later this summer.</LP><TEXT>   Yesterday's 268-161 final vote, in which 26 Republicansabandoned the administration, highlights Mr. Bush's mountingtroubles as he tries to use the allied victory in the PersianGulf war to reshape America's defenses for the 1990s. Whileadministration supporters sought to paint the issue as a voteof confidence in Mr. Bush and the Pentagon's leadership,lawmakers resoundingly rejected the major elements of thepresident's defense budget for the fiscal year beginning Oct.1.   &quot;After the victory, amnesia sets in,&quot; Republican LeaderRobert Michel of Illinois said during the debate earlier thisweek. He urged the House to support the budget &quot;forged by thevision of warriors&quot; and reject the &quot;fragmented,individualistic and parochial&quot; approach of the House bill.   But Democrats, complaining that the White House is seekinga &quot;blank check&quot; for defense priorities, sought to reasserttheir role in setting defense policy. The war &quot;also is avindication of the way we do business&quot; in Congress, saidArmed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D., Wisc.).   Despite early and insistent veto threats from the WhiteHouse, the House's position is likely to prevail in a numberof controversial areas, ranging from upgrading F-14 jets toinsulating National Guard and reserve units from the deepcutbacks proposed by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. And eventhe strongest supporters of the B-2 acknowledged thatsenators will be hard-pressed to provide hefty productionfunds for the embattled bomber.   &quot;It's going to be tougher this year than ever before,&quot;predicted Sen. James Exon (D., Neb.), a leading B-2 supporterand chairman of the Senate Armed Services subcommittee thathas jurisdiction over the radar-evading bomber. He added that&quot;the president is going to have to spend some politicalcapital&quot; to keep the B-2 production line open.   Other B-2 supporters said they would be satisfied if onlyone or two more planes go into production in fiscal 1992,compared with the four sought by the White House. The billwould authorize only $1.6 billion of the $4.8 billion thePentagon requested for the bomber, freezing production at the15 currently in the pipeline.   If Congress doesn't purchase additional planes in fiscal1992 and fails to authorize spending to buy parts for B-2sthat would be built in later years, the prime contractor,Northrop Corp., will be forced to start laying off workersand canceling agreements with subcontractors.   B-2 proponents in the House didn't seek a roll-call voteto pump more money into the program out of fear that anoverwhelming defeat would hurt their prospects of hammeringout a bill with the Senate.   The bill would authorize $2.7 billion of the $4.6 billionPresident Bush requested for anti-missile research under theStrategic Defense Initiative, but it would ban all work onspace-based interceptors called &quot;Brilliant Pebbles.&quot;   For Los Angeles-based Northrop, the B-2's significance hasbeen magnified in recent weeks because the company was beatenout in the competition for the Air Force's next-generationfighter jet. The loss of the fighter contract to rivalLockheed Corp. makes the B-2 the only military aircraftprogram for which Northrop serves as prime contractor. TheB-2 currently accounts for some 55% of corporate revenue.   &quot;Our sales are going to be maintained, and we feel we'restill strong,&quot; Northrop's chairman, Kent Kresa, asserted inan interview after the conclusion of the fighter competiton.He added that, while there was little question that theperennial budget battles over the B-2 would continue, heremained confident Congress would ultimately support theplane, even in a postCold War environment.   The House accepted the Pentagon's target of reducing theoverall number of active-duty military personnel to less than1.9 million from about two million currently. But lawmakersagreed to cut only about 37,000 reservists, rather than107,000 as proposed by the White House.   Other parts of the bill would:   -- Provide about $2 billion the White House opposes forupgrading F-14s, improving M-1 tanks, continuing developmentof the Marine Corps' V-22 tilt-rotor transport plane andboosting research on short-range missile defenses.   -- Reduce somewhat the secrecy surrounding overall costsand other details of certain large classified weaponsprojects. Critics of such &quot;black&quot; programs described theprovision as an important though limited step towardreforming Pentagon secrecy.   -- Assure military women and dependents overseas access toabortions in military hospitals if they are willing to paythe costs.</TEXT></DOC>
