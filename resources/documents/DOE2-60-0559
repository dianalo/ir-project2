<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-60-0559 </DOCNO><TEXT>The implicit continuous Eulerian (ICE) finite difference method in hydrodynamiccomputations has proven very successful when applied to flow situationsin which there are excessive fluid distortions. Code logic becomes exceedinglycomplex, however, if the boundaries of the fluid domain are materialinterfaces whose orientations with respect to the Eulerian grid evolveduring the calculation. It is shown in this article that within the ICEmethodology it is possible to express the discrete mass conservationcondition in an identical form for all computational cells, even thosecontaining, or close to, moving fluid boundaries. From this basis a generalizedICE algorithm is built up alleviating many of the difficulties associatedwith complicated configurations of free and structure boundaries. Inparticular, an effective treatment of slug impact with fluid-structureinteraction is readily formulated. To illustrate the technique in practicalsituations, the method has been incorporated into a version of the coupledfluid-structure code SEURBNUK-EURDYN, used for LMFBR safety analysis,and a number of fluid-gas, fluid-structure situations are analyzed. Resultsare compared with analytic solutions, experimental measurement, and/orother code predictions, as appropriate. Two oblique, slug impact situationsare included.
