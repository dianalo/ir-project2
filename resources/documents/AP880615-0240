Rowan writes in hissyndicated column for Thursday that as long as society is ``awashin guns and drugs,'' he feels justified in using a gun to protecthis home and family.   The column, distributed to 100 newspapers by North AmericaSyndicate, a part of the King Features Group, recounts eventssurrounding Rowan's shooting of a teen-age intruder outside hisdoor before dawn Tuesday.   ``Yes, I've given the headline writers and the pro-gun zealots afield day,'' said Rowan, who has written frequently on the need forgun control.   ``The irresponsible headlines and provocative labels do notbother me, because I know that today's newspapers could be carryingsomething worse: my obituary,'' he wrote.   ``I am appalled that so many people are so eager to spread theirpropaganda about gun laws that they ignore the first overridingfact: that my home was violated, my family was threatened bystrangers who came in the darkness.''   Rowan said he was awakened at 1:55 a.m. by the sound of someoneat his bedroom window and the sight of four people at his backyardswimming pool. After calling the police, he armed himself with ahandgun he said his son, a former FBI agent, gave him during a timewhen he was receiving death threats.   He said he shot Ben Smith, 18, of Chevy Chase, Md., in the wristnear his doorway after Smith lunged at him, despite being warned tostop and being told Rowan had a gun. The youth was treated at ahospital for the injury and released.   The National Rifle Association called Rowan hypocritical forbeing against guns, but owning one himself.   Sen. Steven Symms, R-Idaho, a strong supporter of the right tobear arms, bought Rowan a membership in the NRA and sent him atelegram Wednesday reading:   ``Notwithstanding your past columns to the contrary, youdemonstrated by your recent actions that you agree with my positionconcerning every American's right to bear arms.   ``In America, freedom and justice have always come from threesources _ the ballot box, the jury box and when those fail, thecartridge box.''   The Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms madelight of the incident by announcing that it would award thecolumnist the 1988 ``Pool Shooters Award for defending his poolfrom those who would prey on people pools.''   The group also took the opportunity to condemn the capital'sstrict gun law, which forbids private citizens from having handgunsunless they owned and registered them before 1976.   Police said Rowan's gun was not registered with the city. Thecolumnist said his son, who bought it while he was with the FBI,told him city authorities had said it did not need to be.   The weapons was confiscated by police and the U.S. attorney'soffice is investigating the incident.   Headlines and labels such as ``Rowan Shoots Teen-age Intruder,''``Columnist Shoots Teen Skinny-Dipper,'' ``Rambo Rowan'' and ``TheJacuzzi Gunman'' have been applied to the accounts of Rowan'sencounter with Smith.   But Rowan said, ``When someone has scaled an 8-foot-high fenceand is testing a way to enter my house, I assume he is not comingto get my autograph.''   The columnist said that when he confronted Smith, the youth wassmoking something he suspected was marijuana.   ``Let the National Rifle Association or others call me ahypocrite because I fired a gun in a moment of personal peril. Ishall still be for strict gun control,'' Rowan wrote.   ``But as long as police and prosecutors tell people that theycan scale my fence in the darkness, bring their drugs and beer,party around my pool, rattle my bedroom windows, all with impunity,I'll never know which druggie also has brought a gun.''   ``A lot of theoretical, ideological crap is being written bypeople who have not been threatened, have not had a stranger attheir bedroom window at 2 a.m. and have not been confronted by adoped-up intruder just outside their door.   ``Let my political enemies crow. But let them know that as longas authorities leave this society awash in drugs and guns I willprotect my family.''   Police did not charge Smith with any drug offense. He and ayoung woman companion were accused of unlawful entry initially, butprosecutors dropped those charges late Tuesday.</TEXT></DOC>
