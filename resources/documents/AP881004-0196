A policeman using a loudspeaker told pedestrians the action wasroutine and that officers were searching for suspicious parcels.   Authorities began street-freeze operations following an increasein the number of bombings in white-ruled South Africa.   In other developments Tuesday:   _A policeman fatally shot a black worker who allegedly attackedanother man with a screwdriver outside the luxury Sun Hotel inJohannesburg. Police identified the slain man as John Mhkize andsaid he was a member of the Hotel and Restaurant Workers Union thathas been on strike at the hotel.   _At the United Nations in New York, Secretary of State George P.Shultz criticized congressionally imposed sanctions against SouthAfrica, saying the main victims have been black businesses andworkers. He spoke to representatives of the Organization of AfricanUnity attending the General Assembly session.   Four bombings in South Africa over the past four days promptedpolice to respond with the street-freeze plan. Last month bombingsaveraged about one a day.   The government has blamed most of the bombings on the outlawedAfrican National Congress, saying the black guerrilla organizationis trying to disrupt the October 26 municipal elections.   Government opponents have noted some of the bombing targets wereorganizations or individuals opposed to the policy of apartheid andbombs have exploded in areas frequented only by blacks. They saidthat indicated white vigilantes or secret units of the securityforces might be responsible.   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregatedsociety in which South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote innational affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy andmaintain separate districts, schools and health services.   Police gave few details about Mhkize's death. They said he wasshot after he attacked a man near the entrance of the hotel andthen went into the lobby.   About 3,000 employees of the Southern Sun hotel chain arestriking to protest the dismissal of some workers who did not showup for work on June 16, the anniversary of the 1976 riots in theblack township of Soweto. Many blacks observe June 16 as a memorialholiday.   The Southern Sun management began a lock-out of striking workerson Monday and said they would be dismissed on Friday if they didnot return to work.   Shultz, in his address to the OAU delegates, repeated his standthat mandatory sanctions deprive the United States of the leverageit needs to press for an end to South Africa's apartheid system.   He said American businessmen forced to sell their holdings inSouth Africa have done so, at bargain prices, to the ``SouthAfrican industrial and financial elite,'' and that is the ``wrongsignal'' for the United States to be sending.   ``We believe that a more fruitful approach is to help thevictims of apartheid build their bargaining power throughassistance for education, economic opportunities and communitydevelopment for South Africans,'' Shultz said.   The secretary said the political outlook for South Africa is notencouraging.   ``We remain deeply concerned that unless the accelerating cycleof violence _ practiced by both the government and its opponents _is stopped, South Africa will continue its descent into a siegementality and garrison state in which all South Africans becomelosers,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
