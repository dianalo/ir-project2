The guilty verdict Wednesday in Manhattan federal court _ wherea judge one day earlier sentenced hotel queen Leona Helmsley tofour years in prison for tax evasion _ again demonstrated publicopposition to white-collar wrongdoing.   Some lawyers were surprised by the verdict because ofcontroversial and sometimes contradictory testimony by admittedfelon Boyd L. Jefferies and evidence introduced at the trial'sclose undermining central portions of the government's case.   ``The pattern you see from a variety of these cases is that ifthere is some smoke there _ circumstantial evidence _ then juriestend to find there is some fire,'' Columbia University securitieslaw professor John C. Coffee Jr. said.   ``I do think the jury particularly in Wall Street cases has agood deal of skepticism of the motives of people,'' he said. ``Thisis a case where there was some evidence, but it was a one-witnesscase.''   GAF and Vice Chairman James T. Sherwin were found guilty on alleight counts of stock manipulation, securities fraud, wire fraudand conspiracy. Two GAF subsidiaries were acquitted of all charges.   Sherwin, 56, of Princeton, N.J., faces up to 40 years in prisonand $2 million in fines when sentenced March 9 by Judge MaryJohnson Lowe. GAF, a Wayne, N.J.-based chemical and buildingmaterials manufacturer, could be fined a total of up to $4 million.   ``Justice is finally done,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Carl H.Loewenson Jr. said.   After the verdict, an ashen-faced Sherwin embraced his wife anddaughters. ``I'm terribly disappointed and I'm innocent of thesecharges,'' he said to reporters.   GAF and Sherwin's attorney, Stephen Kaufman, said they wouldappeal the conviction. The subsidiaries found innocent were Jay andamp;Company Inc. and GAF Chemicals Corp.   A July 1988 grand jury indictment alleged a scheme to boost thestock price of Union Carbide Corp. in 1986 shortly before GAF solda large block of Carbide shares amassed during a failed takeover.   When the case first opened a year ago, it attracted wideattention as the first criminal trial stemming from the insidertrading scandals of the mid-1980s.   It lost some luster amid a series of glitzier cases, in whichthe government won convictions in all but one case, where a juryreturned a split verdict.   Among those convicted: six defendants in the Princeton-NewportPartners racketeering trial, takeover specialist Paul A. Bilzerianand Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. bond trading assistant Lisa Jones.   In addition, the government has obtained guilty pleas fromfigures such as former investment banker Martin A. Siegel,arbitrager Robert Freeman and stock speculator Salim B. Lewis.   ``It's another part of the message that the U.S. attorney'soffice has been sending to the financially fortunate of ourcountry, that manipulation of our financial mechanisms and failureto pay taxes are going to be severely dealt with,'' said attorneyGerald Walpin, a former prosecutor.   The GAF jury returned a verdict after about only eight hours oftestimony. The second mistrial, in March, was declared after 12days and 93 hours of deliberations. The first mistrial occurredbecause the government unintentionally withheld a key document.   ``Maybe all the media concentration on fraud on Wall Street haspressured the public that all the fraud on Wall Street was moresevere than it thought initially,'' said Alan Bromberg, asecurities law professor at Southern Methodist University.   ``I think we're developing a pretty healthy distrust of ourfinancial institutions,'' he said.   In the trial's final days, GAF lawyer Arthur Liman introducedtelephone records indicating that no calls were placed onlong-distance WATS lines from the Jefferies andamp; Co. brokerage to GAFor Sherwin during times in October 1986 when the government allegedthe manipulation was discussed.   ``It seemed to be a pretty significant piece of evidence but thejury didn't think so,'' said one defense lawyer in a major case whoasked not to be named.   Jefferies testified that Sherwin asked him to boost UnionCarbide's price to $22 a share and agreed to pay 40,000 to coverlosses in the deal.</TEXT></DOC>
