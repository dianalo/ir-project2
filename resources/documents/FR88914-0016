Clearance of Information Collection Requirements  </ITAG>On March 31, 1983, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) published5 CFR Part 1320, implementing the information collection provisions ofthe Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. (48 FR 13666).Part 1320, which became effective on April 30, 1983 and was revised May10, 1988 <T4>Federal Register</T4>, Vol. 53, No. 90), sets forth procedures foragencies to follow in obtaining OMB clearance for information collectionrequirements.

Regulatory and Legal Authority Background </ITAG>On June 17, 1986, OSHA issued revised standards governing occupationalexposure to asbestos, tremolite, anthophyllite and actinolite for generalindustry and construction (51 FR 22612 <T3>et seq</T3>., Pub. June 20, 1986). Effective July 21, 1986, the revisedstandards amended OSHA's previous asbestos standard issued in 1972. The1972 standard included a 10 f/cc ``ceiling'' limit as well as a 2 f/cctime weighted average (TWA) permissible exposure limit.  Chief among the revised standards provisions was a tenfold reduction inthe TWA PEL to 0.2 f/cc from 2 f/cc. However, although the April 1984 noticeof proposed rulemaking stated that OSHA would consider a revised ceilinglimit, in the final revised standards OSHA determined not to issue an explicitshort term limit (51 FR 22682-3, 22709).  OSHA based this determination on its finding that the rulemaking recordconsisting of ``toxicological and dose-response data failed to show thatshort-term exposure to asbestos is associated with an independent or greateradverse health effect than is exposure to a corresponding dose spread overan 8-hour day; that is, there is no evidence that exposure to asbestosresults in a ``dose-rate'' effect * * *'' OSHA further stated that itsdecision was ``consistent with OSHA's recent policy decision describedin the Supplemental Statement of Reasons for the Final Rule for EthyleneOxide (50 FR 64) in which OSHA established that short term exposure limitsfor toxic substances are not warranted in the absence of health evidencedemonstrating a dose-rate effect (51 FR at 22709).'' OSHA's decision tonot issue a STEL was challenged in petitions filed in the Court of Appealsfor the District of Columbia.  Subsequently, on July 25, 1986, the United States Court of Appeals forthe District of Columbia reviewed the ethylene oxide (EtO) standard whichOSHA had relied on in its decision to not issue an asbestos EL. It heldthat OSHA contravened the OSH Act when it failed to issue a short termlimit for ethylene oxide based on the Agency's finding that the EtO recorddid not support a ``dose-rate effect.'' The Court held that the OSH Actcompels the Agency to adopt a short term limit if the rulemaking recordshows that it would further reduce a significant health risk and is feasibleto implement regardless of whether the record supports a ``dose-rate''effect (796 F. 2nd at 1505). This decision states that ``(B)arring alternativeavenues to the same result, OSHA shall set the standard which most adequatelyassures, to the extent feasible, on the basis of the best available evidencethat no employees will suffer material impairment of health. 29 U.S.C.655 (b)(5) (1982). ``(S)ince OSHA has found that a significant health hazardremains even with the (TWA) PEL, the agency must find either that a STELwill have no effect on that risk, or that a STEL is not feasible, if theAgency declines to impose a short term limit'' (796. F. 2nd at 1505). Because OSHA had relied on the EtO rationale in making its asbestos decision,OSHA decided to reconsider its decision not to issue an excursion limitfor asbestos and informed the Court of its intention to reconsider theSTEL issue based on the existing record.  The Court issued its decision reviewing the asbestos standards in February1988 (<T3>B.C.T.D., AFL-CIO </T3>v. <T3>Brock </T3>838 F. 2d 1258). Therein, the Court noted OSHA's commitmentto complete reconsideration of the STEL issue and ordered ``that reconsiderationbe completed within 60 days of the issuance of the mandate in this case,which issued on July 6, 1988.  The Court also reiterated the criteria requiring an agency to adopt a STEL:<T3>viz,</T3> that the measure will result in a further reduction in significanthealth risk and that it is feasible to implement.  OSHA has reviewed the asbestos rulemaking record in order to apply thesecriteria. The agency finds that compliance with a short term excursionlimit would further reduce a significant health risk remaining after theTWA limit of 0.2 f/cc was imposed. Secondly, the Agency finds that thelowest excursion level which is feasible both to measure and to instituteprimarily through engineering and work practice controls is 1 fiber percc measured over 30 minutes. OSHA therefore is imposing this level as anexcursion limit to be met by all employers covered by the revised standards.The Agency also is withdrawing its previous determination to not issuean excursion limit or STEL.  OSHA notes that it is adopting the term ``excursion limit'' to refer tothe short term permissible exposure limit established here, so that theterminology used by the American Conference of Governmental IndustrialHygienists (ACGIH) and by OSHA will not conflict. The term ``excursionlimit'' is used by the ACGIH to refer to a limitation on short term exposureswhich are called for by industrial hygiene considerations, where toxicologicaldata are unavailable. The term ``STEL'' is used by the American Conferenceof Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) to refer to a short termlimit dictated by specific toxicologic or hazard data (ACGIH ThresholdLimit Values and Biological Exposure Indices for 1986-1987, 3-5). BecauseOSHA is not basing the short term permissible limit for asbestos on toxicologicaldata, OSHA instead is using the term ``excursion limit'' to designate thatlimit.  The term ``ceiling limit'' historically was used by OSHA to refer to botha ``peak'' limit, <T3>ie,</T3> with no duration specified, and to a limit measured over agiven time period, such as 30 minutes. Because of this dual usage, theterm was imprecise and OSHA believes it should be replaced with ``excursionlimit.''This preamble, in some places, uses ``STEL'' and ``excursion limit'' interchangeably,mostly in quoting from previous discussions to conform to previous usage.The following discussion further explains the reasons for OSHA's decisionto adopt an excursion limit of 1 f/cc measured over 30 minutes.   <T3>A. The Excursion Limit Chosen Will Further Reduce a Significant HealthRisk   </T3>OSHA finds that compliance with a reduced excursion limit would furtherreduce a significant health risk from asbestos exposure which exits afterimposing a 0.2 f/cc time-weighted PEL.   OSHA's risk assessment showed that lowering the TWA PEL from 2 f/cc to0.2 f/cc reduces the asbestos related cancer mortality risk from lifetimeexposure from 64 deaths per 1,000 worker to 6.7 deaths per 1,000 workers.OSHA estimated that the incidence of asbestosis would be 5 cases per 1,000workers exposed for a working lifetime under the TWA PEL of 0.2 f/cc. Counterpartrisk figures for 20 years of exposure are excess cancer risks of 4.5 per1,000 workers and an estimated asbestosis incidence of 2 cases per 1,000workers.   OSHA's risk assessment also showed the persistence of a significant riskat the 0.1 f/cc action level. The excess cancer risk remaining at thatlevel is a lifetime risk of 3.4 per 1,000 workers and a 20 year exposurerisk of 2.3 per 1,000 workers. OSHA concludes therefore that continuedexposure to asbestos at the TWA permitted level and action level presentsresidual risks to employees which are still significant.   Imposing the excursion limit will reduce risk to employees whose asbestosexposure is limited to one or two short term bursts, lasting 30 minuteseach. If the periods of exposure are less than 30 minutes then employeeswith more ``bursts'' will also have their risk reduced by the excursionlimit. The maximum reduction will be felt by employees with non-detectablebackground asbestos exposures, whose only detectable exposure is a singleburst (or bursts) lasting no longer than 30 minutes and which measure nomore than 3.2 f/cc (the short term equivalent of the 0.2 f/cc TWA PEL).  To calculate the degree of risk reduction for such employees we note thatthe 8-hour time-weighted average exposure equivalent of the excursion limitestablished here is 0.063 f/cc. That is, if a worker is exposed to asbestosat the excursion limit of 1 f/cc for 30 minutes and exposed to no otherasbestos for the remainder of the day, the 8 hour TWA exposure would be0.063 f/cc. This figure is calculated by dividing the excursion limit of1 f/cc by the number of 30 minute periods in an eight hour work day (16).  The risk assessment methods previously employed in the final asbestos standards(the linear cumulative dose model) can be used to calculate cancer risksfor workers exposed only to one burst of asbestos for 30 minutes at the1 f/cc excursion limit (equivalent to 0.063 f/cc as an 8-hour TWA). Usinglinear proportionality to previously calculated risks, these predictionsare a lifetime (45 year) excess risk of 2.3 per 1,000 workers, and an excesscancer risk for 20 years exposure of 1.5 per 1,000 workers. OSHA believesthat these risks are clearly not insignificant. In this case where workersare exposed only to one burst of asbestos per day, asbestos exposure andthus also cancer risk are substantially reduced by 67%. Where additionalexposures occur beyond the 30-minute exposure, the reduction in risk islower than calculated, and conversely, the cancer risk is greater thancalculated.   The impact of this reduction will be felt by approximately 35,800 employeesestimated by OSHA as having 8-hour TWA exposures below the current 0.2f/cc PEL but short term exposures which exceed the excursion limit. (SeeTable 2, infra).   Thus, in accordance with the <T3>Public Citizen </T3>decision, the imposition of an excursion limitwill further reduce significant risk remaining under the current standard.OSHA estimates, based on the total estimated affected population, and therisk factors cited, that about 118 lives will be saved based on lifetimeexposures and 79 lives based on 20 year exposure because of the impositionof this excursion limit.   OSHA also finds that unregulated short-term exposures to asbestos unnecessarilyelevate cumulative exposures even if the time weighted average is belowthe PEL. Because OSHA has found that significant risks of asbestos-relateddisease exist at cumulative exposures below the 1986 PEL of 0.2 f/cc, compliancewith an excursion limit would further reduce such risks as well (See 51FR at 26647-8), although these reductions have not been quantified.   The ways the institution of an excursion limit of 1 f/cc over 30 minuteswill reduce risks to employees are illustrated by the following examplesfrom the rulemaking record.   In some important operations exposure patterns consist of frequent shortterm rather that continuous levels of exposure. In the construction industry,asbestos removal and repair of asbestos-containing products are often short-termand generate peak exposures (Ex. 84-474, 84-462). Installation of new constructionmaterials also involves intermittent peak exposures, for example, drillingand sawing pipe and sheet.   When asbestos-cement pipe is installed, cutting and machining of pipe canresult in potentially high exposures. A representative of the Associationof A/C Pipe Producers (AACPP) recommended work practices involving shroudedtools, which if followed were said to limit peak exposures for 15 minutesto 0.75 f/cc and 8-hour TWA exposures to under 0.1 f/cc (Ex. 91-16).OSHA believes that the use of shrouded tools on-site will increase becauseof the adoption of an excursion limit. Where only a small amount of cuttingon the construction site is needed, it is possible that a 0.2 f/cc TWAcan be attained with unshrouded tools. With a short term excursion limit,the employer is more likely to require and the employee is more likelyto use the shrouded tools to ensure compliance. In so doing, the employee'scumulative exposure will be significantly reduced and the risk of developingasbestos related disease will be correspondingly reduced.In general industry, the largest group of exposed workers, brake repairworkers, are subject to peak exposures. Their work can be intermittentand the evidence shows that for workers performing occasional brake repairjobs, their exposures occur in short spurts which can be above 1.0 f/cc,but when averaged over an 8 hour day fall within the permissible TWA limit.OSHA believes the imposition of an excursion limit will increase the probabilitythat employers will utilize the more effective but not required, work practicesto assure compliance with the new excursion limit. OSHA had prohibitedone method of cleaning brake linings using compressed air because the evidenceshowed that using that method likely would exceed the new TWA PEL in almostall cases. Other practices, although discouraged, are not prohibited. Theevidence indicated that brushing the asbestos residue from affected partssometimes exceeded a 1 f/cc excursion limit, although the new time-weightedPEL of 0.2 f/cc might still be met (Exh. 84-263, 90-148). Additional informationabout practices which will result in lower short-term as well as TWA exposureslevels is set out in Appendix F to andSection; 1910.1001. Consequently, saferworking conditions will result for the large number of employees performingautomotive brake repair operations.Other general industry employees will benefit from an excursion limit.In secondary manufacturing, especially gasket manufacturing, asbestos operationsoften are conducted on an intermittent basis (Exh. 235 A). The time-weightedaverage would mostly be met even with the use of inferior control equipment.Issuance of an excursion limit would require the use of the best availablecontrol equipment and would thus reduce the risk of asbestos related diseasefor secondary manufacturing workers whose TWA exposures were at or belowthe PEL.In addition, control of short term exposures will help employers identifyand control the sources that result in variable exposures. OSHA notes thatan employee's exposure to toxic substances in the workplace varies fromday-to-day and varies within the day's work shift. The meaning of day-to-dayvariability was considered in the promulgation of the 0.2 f/cc, 8-hourTWA PEL (see 51 FR 22652 to 22654).OSHA recognizes that various factors cause day-to-day variability, includingsampling error in the measurement of the airborne asbestos concentrations,changes in work practices, and changes in ventilation due to misapplicationor malfunction. OSHA has concluded that the major sources of day-to-dayvariability can be moderated by diligent employer control (51 FR 22653).In addition, OSHA has specified a sampling and analytical method whichwould standardize measurement procedures and greatly reduce sampling error.OSHA determined that the 0.2. f/cc PEL is technologically feasible andwill not result in an unfair citation to the conscientious employer. Thereviewing Court upheld OSHA's findings in these respects.Based on its analysis, OSHA believes, for industries that manufacture asbestosproducts, where asbestos is used as part of a continuing process, thatthe causes of excursions within a day are similar to the causes of day-to-dayvariability. Changes in work practice and malfunctioning equipment couldcause exposure excursions. Break-downs were identified as a major reasonfor excursions in manufacturing (AIA/NA, P.H. brief III-44). Within-day-variabilitymay also occur in industries where work with asbestos occurs intermittentlyduring the day; the work cycle will result in temporary and high dust concentrations.Poor maintenance and deterioration of ventilation equipment, such as fanbelt slippage, clogged filters and system damage can also influence withinday variability as the ventilation system copes increasingly less successfullywith the high end of the day's distribution of airborne fibers.OSHA believes that industries that use asbestos on a continuous basis inwell controlled processes such as the manufacture of asbestos products,should keep air concentrations from fluctuating greatly; that the 0.2 f/ccTWA PEL will force the use of the best technology and will require thatdiligent work practices, maintenance procedure and housekeeping be applied.Thus the 1.0 f/cc excursion limit should have minimal impact on these industrysectors and will not require the installation of new equipment and controls.However, OSHA believes that here too, the 1.0 f/cc excursion limit willprovide a quantitative measure of the diligence of the applied work practices,maintenance procedures and housekeeping, and thus will have an overallbeneficial effect to limit both interday and within-day-variability.For the foregoing reasons, OSHA believes that imposing an excursion limitwill further reduce the significant risk of asbestos related disease remainingafter compliance with the TWA PEL of 0.2 f/cc.B. Feasibility and Costs of Meeting the New Excursion LimitThe second prong of the legal test requiring OSHA to adopt an excursionlimit, is that such a limit is feasible to implement, (<T3>Public Citizen</T3>, 796 F.2d at 1505). Because section 6(b)(5) ofthe Act provides that OSHA may promulgate standards to the extent thatthey are both economically and technologically feasible, the followingdiscussion explores both aspects of feasibility. This discussion is organizedinto a summary discussion of technological and economic feasibility forall sectors; a sector by sector operational discussion of technologicalfeasibility, and a discussion of the capability of the OSHA reference method(ORM) to measure the excursion limit. OSHA finds that the new excursion limit of 1 f/cc measured over \1/2\ houris technologically feasible for most significant operations in most affectedindustries using the same engineering and work practice controls that weredetermined necessary to meet the PEL. OSHA believes also that the additionalcost of the engineering and work practice controls will be minimal. Thus,compliance with the new excursion limit is technologically feasible atminimal additional costs, which are well below the threshold of economicinfeasibility. For some operations, OSHA has determined that compliancewith the new limit will require respirators. Since these operations inlarge part are the same which OSHA previously determined will require respiratoryprotection to meet the time weighted average PEL of 0.2 f/cc in the revisedstandards, OSHA believes that the cost of the additional respirators willalso be minimal. OSHA also believes that the costs of the ancillary provisionstriggered by the excursion limit are similarly minimal and feasible foraffected industries.The evidence supporting these determinations consists of data and commentspreviously discussed and analyzed by OSHA in its Final Economic Impactand Regulatory Flexibility Analysis set out in 51 FR 22650 <T3>et seq., </T3>and of data in the rulemaking record illustrating historicindustry capability to meet the excursion limit. OSHA projects that thiscapability will improve because the new limit requires optimum use of existingtechnology.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. General Industry</ITAG>As stated above, OSHA finds that the excursion limit is feasible to achievein most sectors using the same engineering and work practice controls necessaryto achieve the time weighted average limit. In some cases, increased attentionto maintenance of controls, diligence in their application, and housekeepingwill achieve compliance with the excursion limit, when a more relaxed applicationof the same controls would meet the TWA PEL. The data submitted to therecord specifically showing short term exposures indicate that troublesomeareas in meeting the new excursion limit in general industry are essentiallythe same areas as OSHA determined would have difficulty in meeting theTWA limits. Thus data from 1979 showing 60 minute exposures in asbestoscement sheet plants indicated that as with TWA exposures the operationslikely to experience compliance difficulty were finishing or sanding operations(Exh. 235A, Table VI) which are unique to A/C sheet. Although these dataalso imply difficulty for the mixing stage of the sheet process, OSHA notesthat it has determined the wet and dry mixing stages for A/C sheet are``virtually the same as the mixing stages of A/C pipe'', which was judgedcapable for reducing exposures to required levels (51 FR 22656).The relatively poor reported levels in mixing reflect the fact that theA/C sheet industry has lagged behind the pipe industry in using the bestavailable control technology. (See 51 FR 22657.) Pipe-coupling cutoff operationswere also judged to have difficulty in meeting the permissible limits (51FR 22657).For both the sheet and pipe manufacturing operations, therefore, OSHA believesthat only in sheet finishing and pipe coupling should there be problemsin feasibility of compliance without respirator use. Because respiratoruse is likely to be needed to comply with the TWA as well as excursionlimit in finishing, OSHA finds the new excursion limit feasible for theseindustries.For friction products, since no data was introduced specially relatingto short term limits, OSHA analysis essentially turns on its knowledgeof the operations constituting the manufacturing of these products. Asexplained in the preamble to the revised standards, the asbestos frictionproducts include drum brake linings, disc brake linings, disc brake pads,and clutch facings as well as other materials for motion control in industrialapplications. As in the A/C sheet industry, troublesome operations needingrespirators for compliance may occur in finishing operations, similar tothe projections for compliance with the time-weighted average limit (51FR 22657). Other primary manufacturing industries, such as gasket and packings, asbestospaper coatings and sealants and asbestos reinforced plastics are expectedto have similar capabilities to respond to the new excursion limit. OSHAbelieves the feasibility analysis for the TWA permissible limits indicatesthe feasibility of the 1 fiber excursion limit. OSHA notes that its detailedfeasibility analysis based on measurements in such sectors for the timeweighted average PEL identified sectors where OSHA believed that even indry mechanical processing, the newly reduced TWA PEL could be met. Thusthe agency concluded that the gasket and packings industry could meet the0.2 f/cc TWA PEL in dry mechanical operations based on data showing levelsbelow 0.2 f/cc; the asbestos paper industry also, on the basis of measurementshowing a mean TWA exposure in dry mechanical operations of 0.14 f/cc,was found to be able to meet the TWA PEL of 0.2 f/cc (51 FR 22657-59).With respect to secondary manufacturing, the Agency noted in the feasibilityanalysis for the revised standards that in general, receiving and handlingprimary asbestos products do not pose exposure problems. Compared withthe primary processing steps of fiber introduction, mixing, and coveringloose fibers, secondary fabrication takes place in a more controllableenvironment. OSHA had determined that it is feasible for these industriesto comply with the 0.2 f/cc TWA PEL in all operations with the exceptionof some maintenance activities (e.g. repairing or servicing the controlsthat protect the other workers and a limited number of dry mechanical operations,51 FR 22660). OSHA believes this judgment applies equally to the new 1fiber excursion limit.With respect to ship repair, OSHA has already determined that respiratorswill be required to comply with the PEL in many jobs because of the problemsassociated with ship safety rules, confined spaces and nuclear power plants.This imposition of an excursion limit should not result in additional complianceproblems for this sector.<ITAG tagnum="81">12. New Construction </ITAG>OSHA believes that the new excursion limit of 1 f/cc measured over one-halfan hour is feasible for most operations without relying on respirators.OSHA bases this determination on measurement data in the rulemaking recordand the feasibility analysis set out in the June, 1986 preamble to thefinal revised standards. First, the data on short term exposures in the record, even measurementstaken 10 years ago, show that in most new construction activities, the1 fiber excursion limit is easily compiled with. For example in a 1977study of operations involving A/C pipe installation, virtually all hourlong measurements were well below the new limit. After adjustment to thenew 1 fiber limit measured over \1/2\ hour, the only operations which wouldnot be in compliance are cutting of pipe with an abrasive disc saw, andcutting and machining pipe with a doty tool without a shroud and wet methods(Consad final report, table 3.2, (p. 39). Joe Jackson of the Association of A/C Pipe Producers (AACPP) stated thatworkers following AACPP's recommended work practices could almost alwaysensure that they would avoid peak exposures in excess of 0.75 f/cc over15 minutes, while eight-hour time weighted average exposures would remainat 0.1 f/cc or below (Exhibit 91-16, Section p. 12). OSHA stated that ``thecurrent trend is for more of these activities to be performed by the manufacturerrather than in the field'' (51 FR at 22662, citing to Exhibit 333, SectionsG, O, Q), and that the potential for these exposures has decreased substantiallysince the 1977 study upon which he based his conclusions. For those operationswhich will be continued to be performed in the field the study referencedabove and Jackson's testimony support OSHA's conclusion that the use ofshrouded and doty tools will result in exposure below the new excursionlimit. For A/C sheet installation, measurement results of more recent studiesalso indicate that with the use of shrouded tools most operations can complywith the new excursion limit. Thus personal exposure monitoring resultsfrom use of a shrouded circular saw and drill on flat A/C sheet resultedin 40 minute exposure levels of 0.1 f/cc, well below the 1.0 fiber excursionlimit measured over 30 minutes (cite) and use of a shrouded circulatorsaw, sabre and drill in a 1979 study for period of under one half hourresulted in measurements no higher than 0.15 f/cc. (Consad Tables 3.3 and3.4).Installation of asbestos floor products is an operation which generallyresults in very low exposures (see e.g. Ex. 84-474). Although certain activitiesinvolved in removing old flooring may produce exposures which would exceedthe TWA and excursion limits, there appears to be virtually no possibilitythat the excursion limit would be exceeded if the recommendations of theResilient Floor Covering Institute were followed. (See, for example Table3.5 in Consad's report, which indicates that TWA exposures of 2.0 f/ccwere measured when dry removal or dry sweeping was performed. However,the Institute would prohibit powersanding and blowing asbestos dust andwould require wet sweeping and handling.)Other operations involving the installation of construction products similarlyare expected to have few problems complying with the new excursion limit.The installation of new roofing felts and removal of old asbestos-containingfelts, have reported measurements which range from significantly below,to above the TWA permissible limit of 0.2 f/cc. Because the geometric meanconcentration, however, is below 0.1 for all activities involved in roofinginstallation and removal, OSHA believes that the excursion limit will beachievable in most cases. Where based upon circumstances such as the ageand condition of the materials removed, the wind, and location of the job,if appears that exposures may exceed this mean, and respiratory protectionmay be called for to meet both the new excursion limit as well as the PEL.Installation of asbestos sheet gaskets, on the other hand, should easilymeet the new limit without reliance on respirators. Measurement data reportingmostly one-half hour measurements; (the sample ranged from 15 to 95 minutesmeasurements, with most activities measured up to 37 minutes (Consad, Table3-8), shows exposures not exceeding 0.39 f/cc measured over 28 minutes.Based on this data, OSHA finds that the new excursion limit is feasiblefor this sector.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Construction, Abatement and Demolition</ITAG>In the feasibility analysis performed relative to the TWA permissible limitof 0.2 f/cc, OSHA determined that engineering controls cannot routinelyreduce exposure below the 0.2 f/cc PEL during major asbestos removal projectsand that the supplemental use of respirators may be required. (51 FR 22663).Smaller abatement projects, on the other hand, were judged capable of meetingthe TWA limit, because the levels measured over a day's work ranged fromless than 0.1 f/cc to 0.57 f/cc with a geometric mean value of 0.09 f/cc(51 FR 22664 citing to 84-74, Table 3.10). Compliance expectations forthe new excursion limit are that for major removal projects, respiratorusage is expected and employees will be protected against both permissiblelevels by such equipment. For small projects, such as removal of insulationcovering pipes in small areas, glove boxes may be available and can, atleast some of the time, result in exposures low enough to meet both theTWA and excursion permissible limits (see 51 FR 22664).Renovation activities involve asbestos exposure when asbestos materialsused for pipe and boiler insulation, fireproofing, drywall tape and spackling,and acoustical plasters are disturbed during renovation projects. OSHAconcluded in the feasibility analysis in the revised asbestos standardsthat ``engineering controls are generally effective in limiting exposuresafter asbestos-containing materials have been disturbed, but that workerswho actively disturb these materials will probably require respiratoryprotection to comply with the 0.2 f/cc PEL.'' 51 FR 22664.OSHA's contractor noted that ``as in asbestos abatement, exposures in renovationvary tremendously depending on the condition and friability of the asbestosmaterials, and the nature of the work being performed.'' (Clayton report,Exh. 3 at 32). Data submitted on the work exposures of renovation workersreflect TWA measurements, not short term levels. However, based on thetime weighted average levels reported, OSHA concludes that most renovationworkers who are indirectly exposed to asbestos will be protected againstthe limit by engineering and work practice controls but workers who directlydisturb asbestos will need respiratory protection to comply with the newexcursion limit, as OSHA similarly concluded with the respect to the TWAPEL.Maintenance workers will not need respiratory protection for compliancewith the new excursion limit in most situations. OSHA bases this determinationon limited record data which shows concentrations during routine maintenanceactivities in a building in which serious deterioration of the asbestosmaterials had occurred and which appear to be short-term peak measurements.(Clayton report, Exh. 3 at 33).These measurements ranged from 0.02 to 1.4 f/cc. Because these measurementsappear to be a worst case situation, OSHA believes that engineering andwork practice controls will adequately control exposures during routinemaintenance activities within the new excursion limit of 1 f/cc measuredover one-half hour.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Regulatory Analysis</ITAG>Executive Order 12291 (46 FR 13197, Feb. 19, 1981) requires that a regulatoryanalysis be conducted for any rule having major economic consequences.OSHA has analyzed the economic consequences of the asbestos standards aspromulgated in 1986 at that time. The further analysis required for theserevisions follows.A. Population-At-Risk and BenefitsAs part of this analysis, OSHA estimates that, under the current asbestosrule, at least 36,000 workers in general industry and construction remainunprotected from asbestos fiber levels above the 1 f/cc excursion limit.For general industry, about one-tenth of the workers within plant operationswith 8-hour TWA exposures of between 0.1 and 0.2 f/cc may exceed the excursionlimit for thirty minutes a day. This fraction was applied to the sectoralexposure data reported in the Asbestos Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA)[App. G] to yield OSHA's estimate of 2,703 workers affected by the excursionlimit in general industry.In automotive repair, approximately five percent of the population at riskto asbestos fibers are estimated to exceed the excursion limit. Hence,of the 527,000 workers exposed to asbestos in this sector, approximately26,000 face thirty-minute exposures above 1 f/cc. In its RIA, OSHA estimatedthe costs and benefits of using solvent spray on brake-repair work in allaffected establishments under the assumption that all firms would findit cost-effective to keep exposures below the action level by using thesolvents on all repair jobs. OSHA now believes that some establishmentsare able to comply with the current standard without excursion-level controlsand that the costs and benefits estimated for this industry sector in theRIA were too high.To comply with the proposed excursion limit provisions, these brake-repairestablishments would now be required to use the solvent spray, therebyensuring protection of the total population-at-risk in the sector. Assumingworkers affected by the excursion limit perform one two-hour brake jobper day_during which peak exposures_OSHA estimates that use of the spraywill reduce 8-hour TWA exposures from around 0.13 f/cc to 0.06 f/cc (Ex.84-263). Based on the mortality rates for asbestos exposure given in theRIA, OSHA estimates that, in brake repair, approximately 3 of the 39 avoidedfatalities that were estimated in the RIA should be assigned to the benefitsof the proposed excursion limit standard.In ship repair, OSHA assumed that all workers were provided vacuum cleanersand air-purifying respirators for the purpose of reducing TWA exposures.This equipment carries protection factors ranging from 10 to 1,000 andtherefore would also protect employees from high excursion levels (seeAsbestos RIA, Tables G-16 and G-18). For this reason, OSHA projects thatfew ship repair workers are exposed above the excursion limit.In new construction, only asbestos/cement pipe installers are expectedto be currently exposed to high excursion levels at frequent intervals.The estimated 16,000 workers involved in a/c pipe installation can be dividedinto 3,200 crews (five per crew). In the absence of controls, high fiberexposures can occur during the machining and cutting of pipe prior to installation.Employers experiencing excursion-level exposures can use shrouded toolsduring these activities to comply with paragraph (g)(2)(i) in the asbestosconstruction standard. Given the trend to have most of the machining doneby the fabricator, and given the expense of purchasing shrouded tools,it is anticipated that only one-third of the crews will cut pipe at theworksite. Therefore, assuming one person on each crew is involved in cuttingpipe, the population at risk in a/c pipe installation is expected to bearound 1,100.During most asbestos abatement, demolition and renovation jobs, the useof engineering controls and respirators to meet the TWA PEL will also reduceexposures to below the excursion limit (see Asbestos RIA, Table G-20).OSHA anticipates that the excursion level will be exceeded only duringoccasional small-scale jobs, where these controls are not needed to meetthe TWA PEL. Similarly, in two activities within new construction, a/csheet installation and asbestos roofing installation, the use of shroudedtools, vacuums, clothing and respirators needed to meet the TWA PEL areexpected to prevent exposure levels from exceeding the excursion limitin all but a few short-duration activities. Thus, some minor, non-quantifiablebenefits are expected in these sectors once the existing engineering controlsand respirators are applied in the small jobs.The overall population at risk from exceeding the excursion limit in constructionmaintenance is estimated at 32,000. In commercial/residential buildingmaintenance, approximately 90,000 workers in small-scale jobs are potentiallyexposed to asbestos (RIA, p. F-20). However, OSHA believes that only aboutten percent of these workers will be routinely exposed to asbestos. Thus,OSHA estimates that approximately 10,000 employees, working in two-personcrews, will specialize in small-scale repair and renovation work involvingcontact with asbestos. In routine maintenance for general industry, ofthe approximately 220,000 workers exposed to asbestos and not equippedwith respirators, an estimated ten percent, or 22,000, are assumed to beexposed to levels above the excursion limit.Thus, the overall population at risk to exposures above the excursion limitis expected to be approximately 36,000 workers (not counting the populationat risk in automotive repair). In the construction maintenance sectorsaffected by the standard, exposures are not expected to occur on a dailybasis. For the purpose of estimating the incremental benefits of an excursionlimit, the population at risk must be expressed as the number of full-timeequivalent workers. Accordingly, OSHA estimates that the 36,000 workerswith some exposures above the excursion limit translate to the equivalentof 10,000 full-time employees.To develop a quantitative estimate of the expected incremental benefitsof an excursion limit, OSHA conservatively assumes that the use of engineeringcontrols, respirators and other measures will reduce 8-hour exposure levelsby a factor of ten. Table 1 shows the number of expected cancer deathsfor each sector at 0.13 f/cc TWA_estimated as the current mean exposurelevel for all industry establishments impacted by the excursion limit_and.013 f/cc TWA, the level after the tenfold exposure reduction. For eachexposure level the number of expected deaths in manufacturing and constructionis summed. Taking the difference of these two sums yields the figure foravoided cancer deaths. As indicated in the table, OSHA's risk assessmentmodel predicts that an excursion limit of 1 f/cc for thirty minutes willprevent approximately two cancer fatalities per year in the indicated sectors(not counting the benefits in automotive repair discussed above).<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table 1._Estimated Excess Cancer Deaths Avoided Due to Promulgationof a Thirty-Minute Excursion Limit of 1/fcc for One Year </T4>a<H1>Sector </H1><H1>No. of full-time equivalent workers </H1><H1>Expected cancer death at .13f/cc TWA </H1>b<H1>Expected cancer deaths at .013 f/cc TWA </H1>c <H1>No. of cancer deaths avoided</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Primary manufacturing <D>784 </D><D>0.152 </D><D>0.016 </D><D>0.136</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Secondary manufacturing <D>1,919 </D><D>0.368 </D><D>0.037 </D><D>0.331</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Construction <D>6,980 </D><D>1,340 </D><D>0.133 </D><D>1.207</D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total </ITAG><D>9,683 </D><D>1.86 </D><D>0.186 </D><D>1.674</D><F>Source: U.S. Department of Labor, OSHA, Office of Regulatory Analysis.</F><F/>a Automotive repair workers exposed to excursion levels are excludedfrom the analysis in the table.<F/>b Based on exposure data in the Asbestos RIA [App. G], OSHA estimatesthat the population at risk from short-term levels experiences a mean of0.13 f/cc TWA.<F/>c Use of engineering controls and respirators are assumed to resultin a tenfold reduction in TWA exposures.</ITAG>Moreover, as explained in Chapter V in the Asbestos RIA, the estimatednumber of lives saved understates the total benefits derived from loweringworker exposure. Additional expected benefits (but not quantified) shouldappear in the form of reduced worker disability from asbestosis and a reducedincidence of asbestos-related diseases in groups outside the directly exposedwork force.B. Compliance CostsOSHA estimates that the total annual compliance costs for achieving a thirty-minuteexcursion limit of 1 f/cc in the sectors shown in Table 1 will be approximately$29 million. (Some additional compliance costs in automotive repair werealready estimated in OSHA's original RIA and are discussed below.) Table2 shows the number of exposed workers in each industry sector and the breakdownof compliance costs by regulatory provision. In general, the exposure distributionsand the compliance cost formulae presented in the RIA were reemployed here.The majority of the costs will occur in the construction industry, wherethe annual costs are estimated to be $23 million. Primary and secondarymanufacturing are expected to incur annual costs of $2.0 million and $4.4million, respectively. In ship repair, additional compliance costs areexpected to be insignificant because it is assumed that most firms alreadyuse adequate controls in order to comply with the existing provisions ofthe asbestos standard.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>2._<T4>Asbestos Excursion Limit</T4>aa Annual Compliance Costs [By sectorand provision, in dollars]<H1>Sector</H1><H1>Number of exposed workers</H1><H1>Engineering controls</H1><H1>Shower/change rm total</H1><H1>Respirators</H1><H1>Clothing</H1><H1>Monitoring</H1><H1>Medical surveillance</H1><H1>Training</H1><H1>Grand total</H1>Primary manufacturing:<ITAG tagnum="2">A/C pipe<D>29</D><D>0</D><D>34,557</D><D>4,923</D><D>21,750</D><D>2,712</D><D>373</D><D>208</D><D>64,523</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">A/C sheet<D>20</D><D>0</D><D>23,833</D><D>3,395</D><D>15,000</D><D>3,255</D><D>514</D><D>144</D><D>46,139</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Textiles<D>3</D><D>0</D><D>3,575</D><D>509</D><D>2,250</D><D>1,505</D><D>39</D><D>22</D><D>7,899</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Floor tile<D>24</D><D>0</D><D>28,599</D><D>4,074</D><D>18,000</D><D>1,505</D><D>308</D><D>172</D><D>52,658</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Coatings<D>102</D><D>0</D><D>121,547</D><D>17,314</D><D>76,500</D><D>35,941</D><D>1,310</D><D>732</D><D>253,344</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Friction<D>510</D><D>0</D><D>607,733</D><D>86,569</D><D>382,500</D><D>27,664</D><D>6,551</D><D>3,662</D><D>1,114,679</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Paper<D>39</D><D>0</D><D>46,474</D><D>6,620</D><D>29,250</D><D>11,933</D><D>501</D><D>280</D><D>95,058</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Gaskets<D>32</D><D>0</D><D>38,132</D><D>5,432</D><D>24,000</D><D>9,764</D><D>411</D><D>230</D><D>77,968</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Plastics<D>25</D><D>0</D><D>29,791</D><D>4,244</D><D>18,750</D><D>2,006</D><D>321</D><D>180</D><D>55,291</D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Subtotal<D>784</D><D/>b 0<D>934,241</D><D>133,079</D><D>588,000</D><D>96,284</D><D>10,070</D><D>5,629</D><D>1,767,303</D><R/></ITAG>Secondary manufacturing:<ITAG tagnum="2">A/C sheet<D>35</D><D>0</D><D>41,707</D><D>5,941</D><D>26,250</D><D>10,598</D><D>450</D><D>251</D><D>85,197</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Textiles<D>17</D><D>0</D><D>20,258</D><D>2,886</D><D>12,750</D><D>23,500</D><D>218</D><D>122</D><D>59,734</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Friction<D>150</D><D>0</D><D>178,745</D><D>25,462</D><D>112,500</D><D>16,798</D><D>1,927</D><D>1,077</D><D>336,509</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Gaskets<D>997</D><D>0</D><D>1,188,058</D><D>169,234</D><D>747,750</D><D>121,368</D><D>12,806</D><D>7,158</D><D>2,246,376</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Plastics<D>245</D><D>0</D><D>291,950</D><D>41,587</D><D>183,750</D><D>102,890</D><D>3,147</D><D>1,759</D><D>625,084</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Auto remanufacturing<D>475</D><D>0</D><D>566,026</D><D>80,628</D><D>356,250</D><D>83,401</D><D>6,101</D><D>3,411</D><D>1,095,817</D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Subtotal<D>1,919</D><D/>b 0<D>2,286,744</D><D>325,738</D><D>1,439,250</D><D>358,556</D><D>24,650</D><D>13,778</D><D>4,448,717</D><R/></ITAG>Contruction:<ITAG tagnum="2">A/C pipe installation<D>1,100</D><D>1,650,000</D><D>0</D><D>N/R</D><D>N/R</D><D>0</D><D>113,916</D><D>15,796</D><D>1,779,712</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Routine maint. in C/R<D>10,000</D><D>7,417,947</D><D>0</D><D>2,238,004</D><D>3,450,000</D><D>0</D><D>1,035,600</D><D>143,600</D><D>14,285,151</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Routine maint. in GI<D>22,000</D><D>147,400</D><D>0</D><D>5,330,609</D><D>660,000</D><D>0</D><D>0</D><D>315,920</D><D>6,453,929</D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Subtotal<D>33,100</D><D>9,215,347</D><D/>c 0<D>7,568,612</D><D>4,110,000</D><D/>d 0<D>1,149,516</D><D>475,316</D><D>22,518,791</D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total<D>35,803</D><D>9,215,347</D><D>3,220,985</D><D>8,027,430</D><D>6,137,250</D><D>454,840</D><D>1,184,236</D><D>494,724</D><D>28,734,811</D><F>Source: U.S. Department of Labor, OSHA, Office of Regulatory Analysis.</F><F/>a Compliance costs in automotive repair are not reported in thetable (see discussion in text).<F/>b No additional controls are expected beyond those required to meetthe TWA PEL.<F/>c Additional decontaimination facilites are assumed not to be necessarybecause either they would have been required to meet the existing standardor because the operations are excluded due to their small-scale, short-durationnature.<F/>d Employers are expected to minimize the need for additional monitoringthrough the use of objective data or by equipping their workers with air-suppliedrespirators.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Construction</ITAG>Annual compliance costs in construction are estimated at $23 million toprotect approximately 33,000 workers in asbestos/cement pipe installation,routine maintenance in commercial/residential buildings, and routine maintenancein general industry. The Two maintenance sectors in construction accountfor over 92 percent of the costs in construction, with a/c pipe installationaccounting for the remaining cost. Asbestos abatement, demolition and renovationare not expected to incur additional compliance costs. With the exceptionof a minor number of small-scale jobs, exposures in those sectors, andin a/c sheet installation and asbestos roofing installation, are projectedto remain below the excursion limit through the use of engineering controlsand respirators put in place to meet the TWA PEL. During these jobs, additionaluse of existing controls and respirators will be required without any incrementalcosts beyond those previously estimated.As shown in Table 2, compliance costs for additional engineering controls,respirators and disposable clothing in construction are expected to total$9.2 million, $7.6 million and $4.1 million, respectively. No decontaminationcosts are anticiapted because the activities in these sectors are of shortduration and are exempted from this provision.In a/c pipe installation, it is anticipated that short-term exposures willbe reduced through the use of shrouded tools during machining and cuttingof pipe. In the maintenance sectors, supplied-air respirators, glove bags,HEPA vacuums and filters, and disposable clothing and gloves will protectworkers during activities when fiber concentrations may exceed the excursionlimit. Office workers and the general public in commercial and residentialbuildings (c/r) will also benefit from signs alerting them to the hazardsat the worksite. Applying a unit cost of 50 cents for each sign put inplace, the costs of warning signs are expected to total $1.8 million annuallyin c/r maintenance.In routine maintenance in general industry, OSHA estimates that approximately85,000 gasket projects will face asbestos level excursion. Most of thesejobs will be small and therefore will require only one sign in most cases.At a unit cost of 50 cents per sign, the total compliance cost for theregulated-area provisions will be approximately $43,000 in gasket maintenance.To avoid the costs of monitoring exposure levels at each project, it isassumed that construction maintenance crews will purchase supplied-airrespirators and compressors at unit costs of $278.25 and $1,000, respectively,and capitalize them over five years. In addition, firms in commercial/residentialmaintenance and a/c pipe installation will incur costs associated withthe medical and training provisions when the excursion limit is exceeded.(Workers in routine maintenance in general industry are exempted from themedical surveillance provisions because they will be exposed for fewerthan 30 days.) Assuming a medical exam/lost-work-time cost of $100 andrecordkeeping costs of around $3.50 per employee, annual medical costsfor these workers are estimated to be approximately $1.1 million.Training costs in construction are based on the assumption that a supervisor(at a wage rate of $13.10 per hour in construction and $17.11 per hourin general industry (routine maintenance)) will conduct one-half hour trainingsessions for groups of five employees (at an hourly wage rate of $11.91in construction and $16.37 in general industry). Added to these costs ofinstruction are recordkeeping costs (estimated in the RIA, p. VI-41, tobe $0.85 per record in construction and $1.50 per record in general industry),bringing the total cost of training in construction to around $475,000.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. General Industry</ITAG>OSHA estimates annual compliance costs of $6.2 million in primary and secondarymanufacturing. As noted above, the ship repair sector should not experiencecosts to comply with the excursion limit since controls currently in useto meet the TWA PEL prevent thirty-minute levels from exceeding 1 f/cc.OSHA expects automotive repair, however, to incur some compliance costsfrom the use of solvent spray to meet the excursion limit. Assuming one-thirdof the affected employees are currently in compliance, and assuming (asin the RIA) that approximately thirty seconds of worker time is spent sprayingan entire can of solvent spray (at $1.75 per can) on the brake surfaceto minimize the number of airborne fibers, compliance cost is estimatedto be $4.0 million in this sector. As noted above, these compliance costswere already included in the RIA for the TWA permissible exposure level.Hence, the costs are not incremental as are the excursion limit costs inthe other sectors and therefore are not reported in Table 2.Half of the total cost in general industry, $3.1 million, or $1,192 perworker, will be spent on decontamination of workers after high fiber exposures.To comply with the decontamination provisions, employers are expected toexpand shower rooms and change rooms (see pp. VI 15-16 in the RIA for detailsof the calculation) in order to accommodate the estimated 2,700 workerswho are exposed below the 0.2 f/cc TWA but above the 1 f/cc excursion limit.In addition, OSHA assumed that each of those workers would be given onechange of disposable clothing and gloves each day, at a cost of $3 perset.Initial monitoring is necessary to help firms determine the need for respiratoryprotection and to provide the objective data required by the standard wheresuch data does not currently exist. Because exposure levels in primaryand secondary manufacturing will occasionally exceed 1 f/cc for thirtyminutes despite the presence of engineering controls, OSHA assumed thatall employers will perform initial monitoring at each workstation in allestablishments. This assumption tends to overstate actual costs becausein some instances other objective data will be available. Based on theexpected variation in these exposures, OSHA estimates that approximately50 percent of the workstations will have exposures above the excursionlimit. These workstations are expected to continue monitoring twice a yearand to equip their workers with cartridge respirators during peak exposureperiods.For the workstations where exposures exceed the excursion limit but notthe TWA action level, medical surveillance and training would be required.OSHA estimated that half of the workers expected to exceed the excursionlimit will be affected by these provisions for the first time (the balanceof these workers are in establishments where these costs are currentlyrequired under the existing rule). Annual medical and training costs forthese workers is calculated to be about $55,000.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Economic and Environmental Impacts</ITAG>OSHA anticipates no major economic or environmental impacts from the promulgationof the excursion limit. In most manufacturing sectors, estimated annualcompliance costs fall below $100,000. The highest compliance costs in manufacturingwill be felt in secondary gasket production and primary friction products.In these two sectors the additional annual compliance costs are not expectedto exceed one-half of one percent of annual revenue. Thus, OSHA does notanticipate a significant economic impact in manufacturing due to compliancewith the excursion limit.Although automotive repair is expected to face compliance costs to meetthe excursion limit, these costs were estimated previously and were appliedto the economic impact computed in the RIA. The overall economic impacton this sector as described in the original RIA was not significant.Compliance costs in the construction industry are expected to be higherthan in general industry. OSHA estimates that annual compliance costs ina/c pipe installation will be approximately $1,500 per exposed worker,while the per-worker costs in routine maintenance in commercial/residentialbuildings and in routine maintenance in general industry will be $1,400and $300, respectively. However, OSHA expects that firms within the affectedsectors will be able to pass along compliance costs to the building ownersand project developers. As noted in OSHA's Asbestos RIA, higher constructionand maintenance costs are routinely passed forward to owners and developers.Further, annual compliance costs in these sectors represent a minor percentageof the total value of the structure being built or repaired. Therefore,it is anticipated that the impact of the excursion limit on final rentsand prices will be negligible.In accordance ith the Regulatory Flexibility Act, OSHA has assessed theeconomic impact of a 1 f/cc excursion limit on small establishments andcertifies that those establishments will not be adversely affected. Inaddition, OSHA does not foresee a significant environmental impact fromthe excursion limit provision.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Feasibility of Measuring Excursion Limit</ITAG>OSHA also has determined, based on the rulemaking record of the revisedstandard, that the lowest feasible short term limit which can be reliablymeasured for purposes of the OSHA compliance programs, is 1 f/cc measuredover 30 minutes. OSHA reaffirms that the OSHA Reference Method (ORM) providesthe optimal technology for assessing worker exposure to airborne asbestos.A brief review of the ORM is necessary to an understanding of this determination.The ORM is based largely on NIOSH Method 7400, a method widely acknowledgedin the record as superior to the earlier NIOSH Pandamp;CAM 239 method previouslyprescribed by OSHA [Exs. 117-A; 123-A; 328; 330; Tr. 6/20, p. 10; Tr. 6/21,p. 186; Tr. 7/81, p. 69].In the preamble to the revised standards OSHA explained the relationshipof the ORM to NIOSH Pandamp;CAM 239 and to the revised NIOSH 7400 method(51 FR 22688).Because the NIOSH 7400 method takes advantage of technological improvementsthat have been adopted worldwide for asbestos sample analysis, but retainsthe same counting rules as the NIOSH Pandamp;CAM 239, OSHA has used the majorfeatures of the NIOSH 7400 method as the basis for developing a requiredstandardized sampling and analytical method measuring airborne asbestosconcentrations. The method required by the revised asbestos standards forboth general industry and construction, referred to as the OSHA ReferenceMethod (ORM), is detailed in the mandatory Appendix A of each standard.(andSection; 1910.1001 and 1926.58).These appendices require that the employer collect airborne asbestos samplesusing 25 mm diameter mixed cellulose filters and a 50 mm electrically conductiveextension cowl. Samples must be analyzed using a phase contrast microscopecalibrated using a phase shift test slide and equipped with a Walton-Beckettgraticule. The ORM also requires that filter samples be prepared usingacetone-triacetin clearing solution and be counted in accordance with therules specified.The ORM differs from the NIOSH 7400 method in two important respects. TheORM mandates a flow rate for asbestos sampling of between 0.5 and 2.5 lpm.which is similar to the flow rate range permitted by the NIOSH Pandamp;CAM239 method (1.0 to 2.5 lpm). In contrast, the NIOSH 7400 method permitsthe use of any flow rate between 0.5 lpm and 16 lpm. Secondly, the ORMpermits the use of the large 37 mm diameter filter when the employer haswritten justification explaining the need to use a larger filter to obtainreadable samples. Both of these departures from the NIOSH 7400 method weremade in response to commenters who pointed out that the use of high flowrates (e.g., 4 lpm) combined with the use of the smaller 25 mm filter mayresult in samples that are too overloaded with dust to permit the countingof asbestos fibers. This is particularly true in construction where nonasbestosdust particles released to the air as a result of demolition or renovationactivities may interfere with analyzing samples that were collected usinghigh flow rates and the smaller filter. OSHA believes that, by limitingthe flow rate and permitting the use of the 37 mm filter in certain circumstances,employers will be more likely to obtain readable samples in dusty environments.As explained below however, the 37 mm filter will be allowed to measureshort term exposures only when they are above the EL. Since short termexposures in impacted construction activities are likely to exceed theEL, OSHA believes that many employers will continue to have the flexibilityto pick the filter and flow rate to best assure reliable measurement results.In addition, record evidence suggests that the use of high flow rates mayincrease electrostatic charges in the filter apparatus, preventing somefibers from reaching the filter and resulting in lower fiber counts [Ex.84-478: Tr 7/6., p. 99]. OSHA adopted these specific provisions to establishuniformity to the asbestos exposure determination.To determine whether the ORM could be used to analyze short-term samples,and what the lowest feasible excursion limit is, the limit of reliabledetection for 15-and 30-minute samples was evaluated. OSHA calculated thelowest reliable limit of quantitation using the following formulas: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,1,1,8</C> <H1>E</H1><H1>=</H1><H1>(f)</H1><H2>(n)(Af)</H2><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">where:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">E is the fiber density in fibers per square millimeter;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">f is the total fiber count;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">n is the number of microscope fields examined;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Af is the field area (0.00785 mm\2\ for a properly calibrated Walton-Beckettgraticule); and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,1,1,10</C> <H1>C</H1><H1>=</H1><H1>(E)(Ac)</H1><H2>(V)(1000)</H2><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">where:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">E is as above;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Ac is the effective area of the filter (nominally 385 mm\2\ for a25-mm-diameter filter and 855 mm\2\ for a 37-mm diameter filter; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">V is the sample volume.</ITAG>Prior to the ORM, analysts could use different procedures which resultedin different asbestos counts from one laboratory to the next. In additionthe ORM method contains procedures that reduce variability in asbetos countswithin a laboratory. In the final rule OSHA acknowledged that the use ofthe phase contrast light microscope method was approaching its limits ofuse with the new PEL, but OSHA determined the method, with the proceduresrequired by the ORM, could reliably measure 8 hour TWA exposures at 0.1f/cc for purposes of the OSHA compliance program. Using the minimum filter loading that is suggested for the ORM (i.e., 80fibers/100 fields, or 100 fibers/mm\2\), OSHA examined the relationshipsamong these two sampling periods (15 and 30 minutes), the two filter sizes(25- and 37-mm in diameter), and various possible flow rates ranging between2.5 lpm and 0.5 lpm. The results set out in the Table show that 1 f/cc measured over 30 minutesis the lowet level which can be reliably measured for most operations likelyto be affected by an excursion limit. The ORM has been designed to provide needed flexibility to reliably measureexposures in the wide variety of operations where asbestos, tremolite,anthophyllite and actinolite are used. As explained in the preamble toOSHA's revised standards, filter overload or interference by other particlesin dusty environments is accommodated by the ORM by permitting the useof the 37 mm filter when justified, and by reducing the flow rate. OSHAbelieved that in most cases reducing the flow rate will minimize filteroverload for TWA exposure measurements, but allowed the 37 mm filter forstubborn situations, with written justification (51 FR 22690-1). The major industries and operations affected by the imposition of an excursionlimit; construction, and maintenance and brake repair in general industry,expose employees to the kinds of dusty environments which may result infilter overload. In addition, short term bursts of dust containing asbestosmay contribute to overloading the filter. The flexibility needed to reliably measure excursions in these operations,requires the ability to sample at low flow rates. Table <T3>X</T3> shows that only at the relatively high flow rates of 1.6 lpmand above are levels less than 1 f/cc over 30 minutes quantifiable. Wenote, based on the results in the Table that the use of the 37 mm filteris precluded for measuring short term limits down to 1 f/cc over 30 minutes.OSHA therefore finds 1 f/cc measured over 30 minutes is the lowest levelfeasibly measured for the operations impacted by this amendment. OSHA notes that these considerations apply to measurements at or belowthe excursion limit, the level which must be capable of being measuredfor most enforcement and compliance purposes. The employer is not precludedfrom using the 37 mm filter to reliably measure short term exposures <T3>above </T3>the excursion limit so long as the level measured fallswithin the limits or reliability set out in the table. OSHA therefore willallow the use of the 37 mm filter for measuring short term exposures forthe same reasons and requiring the same justification as time-weightedaverage measurements. If an employer uses measurement results to show exposuresbelow the excursion limit, he must use the 25 mm filter. Also, OSHA has determined that employers can comply with the 1 f/cc excursionlimit within the accuracy requirements of the revised asbestos standards.As discussed at length in the preamble to the final rules (see 51 FR 22686-22691),the key factor in sampling precision is fiber loading. Using the minimumloading suggested by the ORM (80 fibers/100 fields, or 100 fibers/mm\2\),employers can be confident that they are measuring the actual airborneconcentrations of asbestos in their workplaces within a standard samplingand analytical error (SAE) of +/^25%.\1\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ OSHA evaluates the precision of the ORM (implemented asNIOSH 7400) as follows: NIOSH has estimated that the overall precision,expressed as the coefficient of variation (CV<T2>t</T2>), of the 7400 method ranges from 0.13 to 0.115 for samples inwhich 80 to 100 fibers per 100 fields have been counted [Ex. 84-444]. Forfilters at the minimum loading suggested by the ORM, (80 fibers/100 fields)the CV<T2>t</T2> is 0.13. This yields a 95% One Sided Upper Confidence Intervalof 21.4%. This is lower than the SAE of 25% currently listed for this methodin OSHA's Industrial Hygiene Technical Manual. OSHA points out, as stated earlier, that a superficial contradiction existsbetween OSHA's finding that 1 f/cc measured over 30 minutes is the lowetreliable level of detection, and data cited regarding lower levels in brakerepair (51 FR 22662). Those measurements, mainly derived from studies,were made by NIOSH with expert analytical capabilities under controlledconditions. In addition these measurements do not reflect the differencesin results that occur due to common statistical sampling factors. As statedabove, OSHA does not believe, based on a full rulemaking record, that suchlow levels can reliably be measured by employers for regulatory requirements.OSHA considers the recorded levels indicative of a range of exposures forthe brake repair industry, and has not used these results for any otherregulatory purposes. Thus, OSHA's finding that the excursion limit of 1 f/cc for 30 minutesis the lowest that can be reliably measured is based upon the enforceabilityof the limit, recognizing that in some situations, lower exposures couldtheoretically be measured and are reported in the rulemaking record. Inreaching this decision, OSHA has relied upon the asbestos rulemaking record,the equations described above being part of the record. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. The Process for Promulgating the Excursion Limit </ITAG>As the foregoing discussion indicates, the <T3>Public Citizen </T3>Court explicitly rejected OSHA's reliance in theEtO standard on the need for a ``dose-rate effect'' to justify an excursionlimit. OSHA based its determination in the revised asbetos standards onthe same rationale. The Agency hereby withdraws the determination. Instead,OSHA has made a new determination based on appropriate criteria and a reviewof the rulemaking record concerning whether and what excursion limit shouldbe required in the revised asbestos standards. Table <T3>X</T3> shows the results of OSHA's analysis. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,10,10,10 </C><T4>Table </T4><T3>X_</T3><T4>Reliable Quantitation Limits for Short-term Asbestos Sampling Usingthe OSHA Reference Method </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[fiber density of 100 f/mm\2\] </ITAG><H1>Flow rate (liters/min) </H1><H1>Sampling time </H1><H1>Lower limit of quantification (fibers/cc)</H1> For 25 mm filters: <ITAG tagnum="2">2.5 <D>15 </D><D>1.05 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">2.0 <D>15 </D><D>1.31 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">1.6 <D>15 </D><D>1.63 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">1.0 <D>15 </D><D>2.61 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">0.5 <D>15 </D><D>5.23 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">2.5 <D>30 </D><D>.51 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">2.0 <D>30 </D><D>.65 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">1.6 <D>30 </D><D>.82 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">1.0 <D>30 </D><D>1.31 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">0.5 <D>30 </D><D>2.61 </D></ITAG>For 37 mm filters: <ITAG tagnum="2">2.5 <D>15 </D><D>2.32 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">2.0 <D>15 </D><D>2.91 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">1.6 <D>15 </D><D>3.63 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">1.0 <D>15 </D><D>5.81 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">2.5 <D>30 </D><D>1.16 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">2.0 <D>30 </D><D>1.45 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">1.6 <D>30 </D><D>1.82 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">1.0 <D>30 </D><D>2.91</D></ITAG></ITAG> OSHA's previous STEL determination did not apply the criteria which theCourt held must compel the issuance of a short term limit. However, thesecriteria; feasibility of the limit and further reduction of significantrisk were raised by OSHA in its proposal (see 49 FR 14116, 14122), andwere the subjects of data and comment submitted to the record as well astestimony at the hearing. Therefore all aspects of OSHA's statutory rulemakingrequirements, consisting of notice, comment and hearing, have been compiledwith concerning whether OSHA must issue an excursion limit (See section6(b) of the Act). Ample notice on all relevant issues was provided by OSHA. In its proposalthe Agency stated it was considering reducing the prior ``ceiling limit''of 10 f/cc to a limit based, in large part on the TWA-PEL which would berequired. OSHA specifically mentioned the possibility of imposing a 5 f/cclimit measured over 15 minutes if a 0.5 f/cc TWA-PEL were chosen and a2 f/cc ``ceiling limit'' if a 0.2 f/cc limit were chosen, and requestedcomments on these as well as ``other suggested limits''. OSHA noted thatceiling limits ``may be necessary to ensure further that employees arenot exposed to dangerous concentration(s) of asbestos fibers'' and alsoasked for ``(i)nformation concerning the feasibility of achieving (thelimits mentioned or others) particularly in industries with variable exposures''(49 FR at 14123). Comment and evidence submitted to the record responded to all relevantissues and provided an ample evidentiary base for OSHA to make determinationsregarding a revised excursion limit for asbestos exposure. Participantsrepresenting both industry and employee groups recommended that OSHA adopta ``short term limit ranging from 0.5 f/cc measured over 30 minutes'' (BCTD,Exh. 330 at 155), to 5.0 f/cc measured over 15 minutes (AIA/NA, P.H. brief,III-45). Data introduced during the rulemaking, as discussed previously, shows thefeasibility of the limit adopted. Most data relates to service industriesand construction. The relative scarcity of data for general industry wasexplained by AIA/NA as resulting from the fact that ``at least in manufacturingplants, there are few routine operations where exposures are episodic.Consequently, the occurrence of peak exposures is generally an unexpectedevent such as an equipment breakdown.'' (AIA/NA, P.H. brief III-44). Data used in OSHA's risk assessment and regulatory analysis similarly showthat the imposition of an excursion limit of 1 f/cc measured over 30 minuteswill further reduce the significant risk remaining after a TWA exposurelimit of 0.2 f/cc is achieved. OSHA finds pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b), that additional notice and commentare unnecessary. OSHA believes that additional notice of the intent toconsider an excursion limit would merely duplicate the prior notice. Asdiscussed above, public participation has already taken place during theextensive rulemaking held to develop the 1986 standards. <ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Summary and Explanation </ITAG>The requirements set forth in this notice are those which, based on currentlyavailable data, OSHA believes are necessary and appropriate to provideadditional protection to employees who are now exposed to airborne concentrationsof asbestos at levels that pose a significant risk of material impairmentto their health. OSHA has considered all data and recommendations on theshort-term limit issue contained in the asbestos docket (H-033). The following sections discuss new individual requirements of the asbestosstandard. The final standard adopts an additional permissible exposurelimit of 1 f/cc excursion limit averaged over a sampling period of 30 minutes.As with the TWA-PEL, engineering controls and work practices when feasibleare the preferred methods to reach the excursion limit. Other provisions of the revised standards are being amended to also requirecertain ancillary protective actions when the excursion limit is exceeded.For example, regulated areas must be established, and decontamination facilitiesbe provided for employees whose exposure exceeds the EL. Employers mustmeasure the exposure of employees to ascertain whether the EL is beingexceeded. For purposes of this preamble, OSHA is combining the discussionof general industry and construction standard provisions which relate tothe same subject matter. Of course, the respective regulatory texts remainseparately designated and codified. For example, the discussion on boththe general industry and construction revised requirements on monitoringis combined. Any differences in application or text between these industrieswill be noted in the discussion, as well as, where required, in the respectiveregulatory texts. OSHA believes that this combined discussion will aidinterpretation of the requirements since a unified rationale, where appropriate,is presented, and differences are highlighted where they exist. Permissible Exposure Limit, Paragraph (c)(2), (General Industry and Construction)In the final amendment, OSHA establishes a 1 f/cc excursion limit for asbestosand revises existing paragraph (c) to incorporate an excursion limit andto clarify that the excursion limit is to be determined as a time-weightedaverage over a sampling time of 30 minutes. In the proposed rule of 1984, OSHA stated that it was considering a ceilinglimit of 2.0 f/cc for a 15-minute period if a TWA of 0.2 f/cc was established.The 1984 proposal specifically asked participants for recommendations forspecific ceiling levels. In response, some participants recommended a 5f/cc ceiling limit (Exs. 92-045, 90-180); a ceiling limit equivalent to10 times the PEL (Ex. 127) and the AFL-CIO recommended that OSHA shouldlower the ceiling level for the asbestos standard proportionally to thereduction in the permissible exposure limit which would be 0.5 f/cc, basedon the AFL-CIO recommended 0.1 f/cc time-weighted average PEL (Ex. 335,p. 46). Based on the rulemaking record of the revised standard, OSHA determinedthat the lowest feasible short term level which can be reliably measuredusing the OSHA Reference Method (ORM) is 1 f/cc measured over 30 minutes.OSHA has also determined that a 1 f/cc EL is effective at lowering totalasbestos dose below that achievable through the 0.2 f/cc 8-hour TWA alone.OSHA has determined that, based on the evidence in the record, a 1 f/cc30 minute EL is feasible and can be reliably and consistently monitored,using available monitoring methodology. There is insufficient evidenceon the feasibility of monitoring and attaining lower short-term exposurelevels.With respect to the length of the permitted sampling period, OSHA believesthat collection of asbestos over 30 minutes is necessary to ensure thata sufficient amount of asbestos is collected for accurate analysis. Itshould also be noted that the newly established ceiling limit of 1 f/ccover 30 minutes, in terms of dose exposure to asbestos, is similar to thelimits that OSHA considered in the proposal, that is, a 2 f/cc ceilingfor 15 minutes.OSHA has determined that exposure to asbestos under the present standardstill presents a significant risk of material impairment to employees.Based on the current record, OSHA believes that compliance with the excursionlimit as set-forth in this paragraph will further reduce such significantrisk.Exposure Monitoring: Paragraphs (d)(1)(i), (d)(1)(ii), (d)(2)(i), (d)(2)(ii),(d)(2)(iii), (d)(3), (d)(4), (d)(5), and (d)(7)(ii) (General Industry);Paragraphs (f)(1)(ii), (f)(1)(iii), (f)(2)(ii), (f)(4) (Construction)Section 6(b)(7) of the Act (29 U.S.C., 655) mandates that any standardpromulgated under section 6(b) shall, where appropriate, ``provide formonitoring or measuring of employee exposures at such locations and intervals,and in such a manner as may be necessary for the protection of employees.''The primary purpose of monitoring is to determine the extent of employeeexposures to asbestos.Exposure monitoring informs the employer whether the employer is meetingthe obligation to keep employee exposures below the established permissibleexposure limits. Exposure monitoring also permits the employer to evaluatethe effectiveness of engineering and work practice controls and informsthe employer whether additional controls need to be installed. In addition,section 8(c)(3) of the Act (29 U.S.C. 657(c)(3)) requires employers tonotify promptly any employee who has been or is being exposed to toxicmaterials or harmful physical agents at levels that exceed those prescribedby an applicable occupational safety or health standard. Finally, the resultsof exposure monitoring are part of the information that must be suppliedto the physician, and these results may contribute information on the causesand prevention of occupational illness.Short-term monitoring is required whenever asbestos concentration willnot be uniform throughout the workday and where high concentrations ofasbestos reasonably may be expected to be released or created in excessof the EL. For example, in the manufacture of asbestos products, peak exposurescould be expected during the dry handling of asbestos in manual debaggingand charging operations, and during mechanical operations such as cutting,lathing, machining, sawing, drilling, and sanding. Peak exposures couldalso be expected during maintenance and repair activities where asbestosinsulation is disturbed and in automotive repair during brake and clutchservicing.Amended paragraphs (d)(1)(i) (general industry), and (f)(1)(ii) (construction),set out general requirements for monitoring required under the standards.They now require that the employer perform breathing zone sampling thatis representative of the 30-minute short-term exposure of each employeeas well as TWA exposures. Paragraphs (d)(1)(ii) (general industry), and(f)(1)(iii) (construction), require that representative 30-minute short-termemployee exposures be determined on the basis of one or more samples representing30-minute exposures associated with operations that are most likely toproduce exposures above the excursion limit for each shift for each jobclassification in each work area.These exposure monitoring provisions require that the monitoring yieldinformation enabling the employer to determine the short-term exposurefor each employee. However, it does not necessarily require separate measurementsfor each employee. If a number of employees perform essentially the samejob under the same conditions, it may be sufficient to monitor a fractionof such employees.Representative personal sampling for employees engaged in similar workand exposed to similar short-term asbestos levels can be achieved by measuringthe exposure of that member of the exposed group who can reasonably beexpected to have the highest exposure. This result would then be attributedto the remaining employees of the group.In many specific work situations, the representative monitoring approachcan be more cost-effective in identifying the exposures of affected employees.However, employers may use any monitoring strategy that correctly identifiesthe extent to which their employees are exposed.Paragraphs (d)(2)(i) (general industry), and (f)(2)(i) (construction),cover the duty to conduct ``initial monitoring'' so that employers havebaseline data on which to determine whether they must conduct further periodicmonitoring. Now employers must perform initial monitoring to determineaccurately the short-term airborne concentrations of asbestos to whichemployees are exposed as well as TWA exposures. However, paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(general industry), contains a provision designed to eliminate unnecessarymonitoring in general industry where employers have monitored short-termemployee exposures to asbestos within a six-month period immediately precedingpublication of this final rule in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>In such cases initial monitoring may be excused,pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(i) (general industry), if the results of theearlier monitoring show that their employees are not exposed to asbestoslevels above the excursion limit.The results of prior monitoring should be acceptable if such sampling wasconducted in accordance with the monitoring provisions prescribed for excursionlimit monitoring in this standard: i.e., prior exposure determinationswere made from breathing zone air samples that are representative of 30minute short-term exposures (paragraph (d)(1)(ii) (general industry)),such determinations were associated with operations that are most likelyto produce exposures above the excursion limit and if the monitoring methodwas accurate, to a confidence level of 95 percent, within plus or minus25 percent for airborne concentrations of asbestos at the excursion limitof 1 f/cc.Based on the discussion above, paragraph (d)(2)(ii) (general industry),permits the use of prior monitoring results to fullfill the initial monitoringrequirements prescribed under paragrah (d), as long as such monitoringsatisfies all other requirements of the new monitoring provisions.In addition, paragraph (f)(2)(iii) (construction) provides an exemptionfrom new initial monitoring for construction employers who have historicalmonitoring data (prior monitoring results). This exemption prevents theseemployers from having to repeat monitoring activity for construction jobsthat are substantially similar to previous jobs for which monitoring wasconducted. The data the employer uses, upon which judgments are based,must be obtained under workplace conditions closely resembling the process,type of material, control methods, work practices, and environmental conditionsused and prevailing in the employer's current operations. Additionally,paragraph (d)(2)(iii) (general industry), and (f)(2)(ii) (construction),excuse initial monitoring, when the employer can demonstrate, on the basisof ``objective data'', that the asbestos-containing product or materialbeing handled cannot cause exposures above the action level and/or excursionlimit under those work conditions having the greatest potential for releasingasbestos.``Objective data'' is limited to information demonstrating that a particularproduct or material containing asbestos or a specific process, operation,or activity involving asbestos, cannot release fibers in concentrationsabove either the action level or Eleven under worst-case release conditions.Objective data can be obtained from an industry-wide study, from manufacturersof asbestos-containing products or materials, or from laboratory test resultsof an asbestos containing product. For the employer who relies upon anindustry-wide study, the data he uses must be obtained under workplaceconditions closely resembling the processes, type of material, controlmethods, work practices, and environmental conditions used and prevailingin the employer's current operations. Sampling and analytical proceduresmust conform to NIOSH and/or OSHA approved methods. The following threeexamples illustrate how an employer may use ``objective data'' to avoidthe burden of initial monitoring.In the automotive brake and clutch repair industry (the largest group ofexposed workers) OSHA has determined that employers can successfully reducetheir employees' exposures to asbestos to below the EL by employing theenclosed cylinder/HEPA vacuum system method as described in Appendix Fto andSection; 1910.1001. This determination is based on evidence in therulemaking record (NIOSH Report 32.4, Ex. 84-263). The effectiveness ofthe vacuum/enclosure is dependent upon the mechanic being adequately trainedso that he/she can perform the manufacturer's recommended sequence of stepswith care and skill. OSHA therefore believes that employers in the brakeand clutch repair industry will be able to avail themselves of exemptionfrom initial monitoring in this amended standard if they conscientiouslyemploy the enclosed cylinder/HEPA vacuum system.In construction, where certain operations are short-term, intermittentin nature and generate peak exposures, data show that the use of shroudedtools may limit peak exposures to below the EL. An example of a detailedstudy, which can be used as objective data in lieu of exposure monitoringis Ex. 84-279. This study by the A/C Pipe Producers Association shows thatunder certain conditions (e.g. experienced workmen, properly maintainedequipment, strict adherence to recommended work practices), cutting andmachining A/C pressure and sewer pipe, using wet methods and a shroudedDoty tool will limit exposures to below 0.5 f/cc.Small-scale, short-duration maintenance or renovation activities wherethe use of glove bags and wet methods are capable of keeping employee exposuresto asbestos below the 0.1 f/cc action level and 1 f/cc EL is another situationwhere objective data could be used to obviate the need for exposure monitoring.The success of glove bag asbestos removal operations relies heavily onthe use of workers specially trained in asbestos abatement working underwell controlled conditions. Generally, two persons are required to performremoval especially with the use of heavy bags or in elevated locations.Diligence on the part of management and employees is essential for minimizingcontamination. Appendix G to andSection; 1926.58 (51 FR 22785)_``Work Practicesand Engineering Controls for Small-Scale, Short Duration Asbestos Renovationand Maintenance Activities'', provides requirements for glove-bag procedureswhich when followed by employers, will satisfy the requirements for relyingon ``objective data'' to be relieved from monitoring duties.In general industry the amended provisions regarding initial monitoring,periodic monitoring, and termination of monitoring requirements relativeto the excursion limit are found in paragraphs (d)(2)(i), (d)(3), and (d)(4).These provisions do not change the frequency and termination of monitoringprovisions as they apply to the action level.Where the employer has kept exposures below the applicable action leveland excursion limit, the regulatory scheme normally excuses periodic monitoring.Existing paragraph (d)(5) (general industry) of OSHA's asbestos standardrequires a new exposure determination for TWA exposures whenever therehas been a change in production, process, control equipment, personnelor work practices that may result in new or additional asbestos exposures.With the adoption of an excursion limit, revised paragraph (d)(5) willalso require additional excursion limit monitoring or determination wherethe employer suspects that workplace changes may increase short-term exposures.Short-term monitoring or an allowable determination should be repeatedwhenever situations arise or workplace changes occur which could increaseemployee short-term exposure.In construction, initial monitoring and termination of monitoring requirementsare found in paragraph (f)(2)(i) and (f)(4). As in general industry, theexcursion limit does not change the current frequency of initial monitoringand termination of monitoring provisions.The construction employer can lessen the burden of daily monitoring ina regulated area during removal, demolition and renovation operations,by providing all employees, within the regulated area, supplied-air respiratorsoperated in the positive-pressure mode (andSection; 1926.58(f)(3)).Paragraphs (d)(6) (general industry) and (f)(5) (construction) of the currentasbestos standards require that monitoring methods be accurate to withinplus or minus 25% of the OSHA Reference Method (ORM) results with a 95%confidence level as demonstrated by a statistically valid protocol. Itis clear to OSHA, based on data in record, that adoption of excursion limitaccuracy requirements are necessary to ensure that employees exposuresare adequately determined. OSHA also finds that the record supports adoptionof accuracy parameters of plus or minus 25 percent at the 95 percent confidencelevel (See discussion <T3>supra</T3>).OSHA, therefore, adopts in final paragraph (d)(6)(ii), the requirementthat monitoring to a confidence level of 95 percent, shall be accurate,to within plus or minus 25 percent for airborne concentrations of asbestosat the 30 minute excursion limit of 1 f/cc.Paragraph (d)(7)(i) (general industry) and (f)(6)(i) (construction) requirethat employers notify employees of the results of excursion limit monitoringperformed pursuant to the standard. Such notification has been determinedto be appropriate where TWA monitoring is performed, and is believed tobe appropriate where excursion limit monitoring is performed.Regulated Areas: Paragraph (e)(1), (General Industry and Construction)The amended provision of paragraph (e) in the general industry standardnow will require employers to designate as regulated areas any locationsin their workplaces where occupational exposures to airborne concentrationsof asbestos exceed the excursion limit as well as the TWA-PEL. This regulatedarea concept is consistent with other OSHA toxic substance standards.The intent of OSHA's regulated area requirement is to protect employeesfrom unknowingly entering areas where their exposures exceed either PEL.They will be warned of the need to wear respirators and to keep out ifthey have no need to be present.Only authorized persons may enter regulated areas, which are required tobe clearly marked to ensure that employees are aware of these locations.Warning signs are to be posted at each regulated area and at all approachesto regulated areas so that an employee can take the necessary protectivesteps before entering the area. The final standard gives employers an optionof whether to use, for example, ropes, markings, temporary barricades,gates or more permanent enclosures to demarcate and limit access to theseareas.Paragraph (e) of the construction standard now requires employers to establishregulated areas whenever the PELs are exceeded. Regulated areas requiredby the standard can take two forms. For most employers who perform asbestosremoval, demolition, or renovation operations (other than small-scale short-duration),the regulated area must consist of a negative-pressure enclosure that willconfine the asbestos fibers being generated to the area within the enclosureand will thus protect other employees and bystanders on the site from exposureto excessive levels of asbestos. For small-scale, short-duration removal,demolition and renovation operations and for asbestos work operations thatdo not involve asbestos removal, demolition, or renovation, the employermay simply demarcate the regulated area by posted signs that limit thenumber of employees entering the area.Regulated areas do not have to be established when engineering and workpractice controls reduce employee exposures to asbestos to levels belowthe standard's TWA and excursion permissible limits.Methods of Compliance: Paragraphs (f)(1)(i), (f)(1)(ii), (f)(2)(i) and(f)(2)(iv) (General Industry); Paragraphs (g)(1)(i), (g)(2)(ii), and (g)(3)(Construction)As discussed previously (see section on Summary of Regulatory Flexibilityand Impact Analysis) OSHA believes that compliance with both the excursionlimit and 8-hour TWA PELs can be accomplished by the majority of the asbestosindustry through implementation of feasible engineering and work practicecontrols. OSHA, therefore, requires in paragraph (f)(1)(i) (general industry),and (g)(1)(i) (construction), of the amended asbestos standards, that theemployer institute engineering and work practice controls to reduce andmaintain employee exposure to or below the PELs except to the extent thatsuch controls are not feasible. The amended rule further requires, in paragraph(f)(1)(ii) (general industry) and (g)(1)(ii) (construction), that whereverfeasible engineering controls and work practices that can be institutedare not sufficient to reduce employee exposure to or below the PELs, theemployer shall use them to reduce exposure to the lowest levels achievableby those controls, and shall supplement them by the use of respirators.Based on available evidence, OSHA believes that the use of engineeringand work practices controls will reduce employer exposure to or below thePELs for many work situations.The methods used to control the EL will of course vary with the operation.In the revised general industry standard employers in the automotive brakeand clutch repair industry can successfully reduce their employees' exposuresto asbestos to below the EL by employing the enclosed cylinder/HEPA vacuumsystem method as detailed in Appendix F to andSection; 1910.1001.In the revised construction standard, OSHA listed general categories ofwork practices and engineering controls acceptable for meeting the PEL(andSection; 1926.58(g)(1)). One activity likely to be impacted by this ELis maintenance and repair operations. These employers can use either singlyor in combination: local exhaust ventilation equipped with HEPA filterdust collection systems, general ventilation systems, wet methods, vacuumcleaners equipped with HEPA filters, enclosure or process isolation, andprompt disposal of asbestos waste, all of which are listed in the previouscited provision.In the installation of new construction materials such as A/C pipe andsheet the use of tools fitted with local exhaust shrouds connected to aHEPA vacuum have been demonstrated to reduce airborne asbestos concentrationssignificantly. Such shrouded tools are capable of reducing exposures belowthe excursion limit (Ex. 84-279).OSHA in general believes that the imposition of the EL will not requirethe purchase of new controls or the development of new or different processes.Since many firms already use adequate controls in order to comply withthe existing provisions of the asbestos standards, OSHA believes that meetingthe EL will often require increased diligence in the application of existingcontrols and work practices implemented for the 8-hour TWA-PEL. These measuresinclude such items as, but not limited to: (1) Frequently checking theeffectiveness of exhaust systems, (2) increased attention to good housekeeping,employing a regular cleanup schedule using HEPA filtered vacuum cleaners,(3) periodic inspection and maintenance of process and control equipmentto prevent system failure, (4) better trained workers to carry out theirjob functions with greater care and skill, and (5) improved supervisionensuring that work practices are carried out properly. In addition to theabove measures the employer should consider shutting-off or temporarilymodifying the air-hauling system to prevent the distribution of asbestosfibers to areas outside the work site and to other areas in the building.Amended paragraph (f)(2)(i) (general industry) requires, where either PELis exceeded, that the employer establish and implement a written programto reduce employer exposure to or below the excursion limit, by means ofengineering and work practice controls, and by the use of respirators whenpermitted.It is OSHA's belief that the written plan for achieving the excursion limitis as essential as the written plan requirement adopted for achieving theTWA, in ensuring that the employer implement the necessary controls toreduce exposure. The plan also provides the information that would allowOSHA, the employer, and employees to examine the excursion limit controlmethods chosen and to evaluate the extent to which these planned controlsare being implemented. As with the TWA written plan, the excursion limitcompliance plan will be accessible to individuals designated in paragraph(f)(2)(iii) (general industry) for inspection and copying.Final paragraph (f)(2)(iv) (general industry) and (g)(3) (construction),prohibits employee rotation as a means of compliance with the excursionlimit for the same reasons that employee rotation is not permitted forcompliance with the TWA. This prohibition is consistent with OSHA's viewthat this control strategy is not appropriate in occupational environmentsinvolving exposure to potential carcinogens. It results in exposure ofa larger number of employees to levels of asbestos which still presenta significant risk.Respiratory Protection: Paragraph (g)(1) (General Industry); Paragraph(h)(1)The amended standards provide that respirators be used to limit short-termemployee exposure to asbestos in the following circumstances:<ITAG tagnum="21">(i) During the interval necessary to install or implement feasibleengineering and work practice controls;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) In work operations such as maintenance and repair activitiesor vessel cleaning or other activities for which the employer establishesthat engineering and work practice controls are not feasible;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) In work situations where feasible engineering and work practicecontrols are not yet sufficient to reduce exposure to or below the excursionlimit.</ITAG>These same requirements apply under the current standard with respect torespirator use in complying with the TWA, and are based on OSHA's establishedpolicy on compliance methodology (see preamble discussion in the currentasbestos standard, 51 FR 22692).OSHA has estimated that respirator use will be required to meet the excursionlimit in a number of general industry operations as well as routine maintenanceand repair in general industry and construction. So that respirator usewill be effective OSHA has incorporated the requirements of andSection; 1910.134into the revised standards supplemented by requirements such as fit testingprotocols for respirator use. OSHA is concerned about relying on respiratoruse to meet the EL in the maintenance and repair sector of the constructionindustry. Although maintenance crews employed by larger building maintenancefirms may often be specialized for asbestos work and trained accordingly,smaller building firms where work with asbestos is spotty and perhaps notalways recognized may not institute adequate respirator programs.The imposition of an EL hopefully will fill lapses in respirator programsin such firms, if ony because a specific short-term limit corresponds withthe asbestos exposure of most maintenance employees and thus highlightsthe need for protection, i.e., respiratory control.Of course, engineering and work practice controls are still preferred,but as discussed earlier, for these operations respiratory protection oftenwill be the feasible control strategy.Other requirements under these paragraphs dealing with ``Respirator selection''and ``Respirator program,'' remain unchanged and apply where respiratorsare used to achieve the excursion limit.<T3>Protective Work Clothing: Paragraphs (h)(1), (h)(3)(iii), (h)(3)(iv)(General Industry); Paragraphs (i)(1), (i)(2)(i), (i)(2)(ii) (Construction).</T3>Existing paragraphs (h)(1) (general industry), and (i)(1) (construction),require that the employer provide to employees and ensure that the employeesuse appropriate protective clothing and equipment whenever the employeesare exposed above the 8-hour TWA-PEL.OSHA adopts in this rule, a similar requirement relative to the excursionlimit, that protective clothing such as coveralls or similar full-bodywork clothing, gloves, head coverings, foot coverings, and face shieldsor other appropriate eye protection (when necessary to prevent eye irritation)be provided to employees exposed above the excursion limit.It is OSHA's belief that protective clothing and foot coverings be requiredabove the EL to prevent contamination of the employee's street clothingand shoes, so that exposure is not extended both beyond the time periodand work area when the excusion limit was exceeded and beyond the workdayand workplace.The amended standards (h)(3)(iii), (h)(3)(iv) (general industry), and (i)(2)(i),(i)(2)(ii) (construction) require that the employer ensure that launderingof contaminated clothing be done in a manner that prevents the releaseof airborne asbestos fibers in excess of the PELs, and to inform thosewho launder or clean the contminated protective clothing to exercise cautionto prevent the release of fibers in excess of the PELs. These provisionsare designed to make clear the need to use proper care in handling of thecontaminated clothing.<T3>Hygiene Facilities and Practices: Paragraphs (i)(1)(i), (i)(2)(i),(i)(3)(i), (i)(3)(iii), (General Industry); Paragraph (j)(1)(iii), (Construction).</T3>The amended provisions in general industry, require that the employer providehygiene facilities and ensure that employees engage in good personal hygienewhen asbestos exposures exceed both the 8-hour TWA-PEL and excursion limit.Specifically, employers are required to provide clean changerooms, showers,and lunchroom facilities and ensure that employees that work in areas wheretheir exposures exceed either PEL, wash their hands and faces prior toeating, drinking and smoking and shower at the end of the work shift. Similar provisions for hygiene facilities and good personal hygiene practicesare found in the construction standard and are required whenever the 8-hourTWA-PEL or excursion limit is exceeded. However, unlike the general industrystandard that requires the lunchroom be provided with a positive-pressurefiltered air supply, the construction standard requires that airborne asbestosconcentrations within lunchrooms be kept below the action level and excursionlimit.<T3>Communication of Asbestos Hazards to Employees: Paragraph (j)(5)(i)(General Industry); Paragraph (k)(3)(i) (Construction).</T3>Existing paragraphs (j)(3)(i) (general industry) and (k)(3)(i) (construction)require that information and training concerning asbestos be provided toemployees exposed at or above the action level. OSHA adopts in this rule,a requirement that information and training on asbestos be also providedto employees exposed at or above the excursion limit.OSHA is adopting this provision based on the determination that informingemployees through training, that high levels of asbestos might be releasedinto the workplace, will better enable affected employees to take precautionarymeasures to protect themselves.Medical Surveillance: Paragraphs (l)(1)i), (l)(4)(i) (General Industry);Paragraph (m)(1)(i) (Construction)The amended standard for general industry requires each employer to institutea medical surveillance program for all employees who are or will be exposedto asbestos at or above the action level and/or excursion limit.The amended standard for construction requires employers to implement themedical surveillance program only for employees required by the standardto wear negative-pressure respirators and for employees exposed to levelsof asbestos at or above the action level and/or above the excursion limitfor 30 or more days per year. Since significant health risks are likely to be present at the excursionlimit OSHA believes that it is essential that workers are provided medicalsurveillance whenever worker exposure exceeds the EL as well as at or abovethe action level. The initial and annual medical examination and evaluationis an important tool in protecting the worker exposed to asbestos by: detectingchanges in a worker's physical condition, detecting biological effectsof inhalation of asbestos as early as possible, providing a way to re-evaluatethe workplace conditions, and evaluating the worker's suitability to continuedoing the same job. For these reasons OSHA feels that the amended standardsshould require medical surveillance triggered above the excursion limitas well as by the action level.Dates, Paragraph (o), (General Industry and Construction)<ITAG tagnum="81">Effective Date</ITAG>The amendments to the asbestos standards will become effective thirty (30)days following publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. OSHA believes that a 30 day period between issuanceof these standards and their effective date provides sufficient time foremployers and employees to become informed of the existence of the standardsand their requirements.<ITAG tagnum="81">Start-up Dates</ITAG>Since there was little record evidence on this issue, OSHA is using itsexperience in making a determination on the startup dates for these standards.The start-up dates discussed below provide the time required for employersto implement training programs and medical surveillance; to order and receiveprotective equipment and respirators; to construct changerooms, showers,lavoratories, and lunchrooms; to plan, order, receive and install engineeringcontrols; and to implement work practice controls. OSHA believes that thedates set in this standard should be adequate in all but unusual circumstances.OSHA believes that expeditious action by employers to achieve compliancewith the provisions of these amended standards is warranted. Employeesunder the current standard are being exposed to asbestos at concentrationsthat present a significant risk of adverse health effects. Compliance withthe excursion limit will further reduce total asbestos dose, and thereforethe risk, to which employees are presently being exposed under the existingrule. The information available to OSHA clearly indicates that, with few exceptions,affected employers can be reasonably expected to be able to implement feasibleengineering and/or work practice controls that would bring their workplacesinto compliance with the amended standards' excursion limit within 6-monthsfrom the effective date of this standard.As stated earlier in this discussion OSHA believes that the impositionof the EL will not necessarily require the purchase of new controls orthe development of new or different processes. Many firms already use adequatecontrols in order to comply with the existing provisions of the asbestosstandards. Therefore, OSHA believes that meeting the EL will often requireincreased diligence in the application of existing controls and work practicesimplemented for the 8-hour TWA-PEL. Consequently, employers should be ableto comply with this provision in the time-frame specified.OSHA believes that employers should be able to achieve compliance withchangerooms, showers, lavatories and lunchroom facilities within one yearafter the effective date. This time-frame appears to be reasonable, sinceit allows employers an additional six months after engineering controlsare completed to install hygiene and lunchroom facilities, should engineeringand work practice controls fail to reduce exposures below the EL. The amendedstandards like the current standards do not require the immediate installationof changerooms, showers, lavatories, and lunchrooms if installation ofengineering controls would only make their use necessary for a few months.Additionally, compliance with all the other requirements of the standardwithin ninety (90) days of the effective date also is believed by OSHAto be appropriate. In response to the requirements set forth in OSHA's1986 asbestos standard, asbestos employers have aready instituted programsregarding training, compliance plans, respirators, exposure monitoringand work practices, recordkeeping, signs and labels, and regulated areas.Thus, compliance with new burdens imposed by adoption of the excursionlimit within the periods specified is believed to be reasonable and appropriate.If the time period for meeting any of these startup dates cannot be metbecause of technical difficulties, employers are entitled to petition theAssistant Secretary for a temporary variance under section 6(b)(6)(A) ofthe Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII.
