Leaving nothing to chance in making sure no stray language creptinto the platform, the aides were seen standing at the back ofsubcommittee hearings Tuesday giving nods and signals to panelmembers on how to deal with votes.   In the subcommittee on family and community, the staff activitywas particularly noticeable during the discussion of language onAIDS. The plank says AIDS victims should be encouraged to seekearly diagnosis and remain at their jobs or in school as long asthey are physically able.   One Bush staffer gave thumbs up and down signals, as wellnodding his head up and down and maintaining eye contact withpanelists.   The orchestration by the Bush staff was ``not at allMachiavellian,'' said Deborah Steelman, campaign director ofdomestic policy.   Noting confusion voiced by subcommittee members over platformtax language, she said, ``The proposals are not very wellunderstood by the committee. Many of them are much more informedthan others. ...   ``We just have to make sure that everybody understands whatBush's position is and where we stand in terms of what they have onthe table,'' Steelman said.   She noted that the vice president had addressed the platformdelegates Monday, seeking to make sure that the platform is veryspecific. ``That's what we're involved in here today, to make surethat that happens,'' she said.   During one break in the family subcommittee meeting, panelistshuddled with the Bush staff before coming back to withdraw a motionthat called for weakening of agency shop rules on mandatory paymentof union dues.   Steelman said new AIDS language submitted by subcommitteeco-chairman Rick Montoya _ and approved unanimously by the panel _was instigated by the campaign and is consistent with Bush'sposition.   In presenting it, Montoya said it showed sensitivity to theneeds of AIDS victims as well as concern mentioned in earlierlanguage about the spread of the deadly disease.   The gay community for years has criticized President Reagan asbeing insensitive to the AIDS crisis. The party's 1984 platformcontained no mention of the disease.   As a member of the Reagan administration, Bush engenders thesame suspicion from gays.   In the foreign policy subcommittee hearing, former Sen. JohnTower of Texas, a top Bush supporter, made no bones aboutrepresenting the campaign when he stood up to urge the committee toleave language on Israel intact.   He told the committee he was speaking as a representative of theBush campaign.</TEXT></DOC>
