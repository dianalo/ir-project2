Col. William R.Higgins, who reportedly was hanged by his Shiite Moslem captors.Another American hostage was given a reprieve.   The envoy, Marrack Goulding, said he also would work on winningfreedom for other hostages in Lebanon.   The pro-Iranian Organization of the Oppressed on Earth said itkilled Higgins on Monday in retaliation for Israel's refusal tofree Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a Shiite Moslem cleric kidnapped byIsraeli commandos July 28.   Israel's defense minister, Yitzhak Rabin, today defended theabduction and said the government considered the dangers tohostages in Lebanon before approving it.   Rabin also said interrogation of Obeid revealed he played acentral role in Higgins' abduction.   After talks with President Bush, Pope John Paul II agreed tointervene to seek the return to the United States of Higgins' body.   The Revolutionary Justice Organization, which holds Americanhostage Joseph Cicippio, said it would kill Cicippio on Tuesday at11 a.m. EDT unless Israel had freed Obeid. It then extended thedeadline 48 hours.   Shiite sources in Lebanon, speaking on condition they not befurther identified, said today they believed Iran may have steppedin to save Cicippio because of the international uproar overHiggins' reported hanging.   The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth released a crudevideotape Monday purportedly showing Higgins hanging, but there wasno way of knowing when the tape was made.   Rabin said today Israel had unconfirmed reports Higgins waskilled ``months ago.''   Goulding, the U.N. undersecretary-general in charge ofpeacekeeping, stopped in Israel en route to Lebanon and toldreporters, ``My mission is to find out what happened to Col.Higgins and to see what can be done to bring about the release ofthe other hostages.''   Higgins, 44, was commander of an observer team attached to theU.N. Interim Force in Lebanon when he was kidnapped Feb. 17, 1988.   Goulding flew to UNIFIL's Lebanon headquarters, in the bordertown of Naqoura, and went into immediate talks with the UNIFILcommander, Maj. Gen. Lars-Eric Wahlgren.   Goulding was scheduled to visit Beirut on Thursday and meet withLebanese leaders, including some Shiites. UNIFIL spokesman TimurGoksel refused to name the leaders.   ``There are no negotiations involved, although he has asecondary mission of trying to find out about other hostages inLebanon,'' Goksel said.   In announcing the extension for Cicippio, the RevolutionaryJustice Organization acknowledged a plea from Cicippio's Lebanesewife, Elham, and cited ``friendly appeals and sincere behests.''   ``The Iranians probably are bringing immense pressure on theirLebanese surrogates, seeking to defuse the crisis generated byHiggins' murder,'' one Shiite source in Lebanon said, speaking oncondition he not be identified.   Iran is the financial and spiritual backer of Hezbollah, orParty of God, the fundamentalist faction believed to be theumbrella for groups holding most of the 16 foreign hostages inLebanon.   The Shiite source noted that Revolutionary Justice has useddeath threats in the past to back political demands but never haskilled a hostage.   ``Even if it was a postponement for only one minute, it's betterthan nothing,'' said Elham Cicippio, who married Cicippio after heconverted to Islam in 1985.   Cicippio, 58, was acting comptroller of the American Universityof Beirut when he was kidnapped Sept. 12, 1986.   The statement announcing the reprieve was accompanied by aphotograph of another American hostage, Edward Austin Tracy, 58, aself-styled wanderer and writer kidnapped Oct. 21, 1986. It was thefirst picture of him released since March 8.   There are four other Americans among the foreigners held inLebanon. The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief MiddleEast correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March16, 1985.   Rabin today repeated Israel's offer to swap Obeid and LebaneseShiite Moslem prisoners held in Israel for Israeli soldiers and theforeigners held in Lebanon.   Hezbollah, of which Obeid is reported to be a leader, hasrejected a swap.   Rabin said Obeid admitted under interrogation that Higgins'three abductors were at his home in south Lebanon the night beforethe kidnap. He quoted Obeid as saying the kidnappers' car washidden in his garage for a month.   Earlier reports said Higgins was held for two days in Obeid'shouse.   Rabin said the kidnap of Obeid was approved two months ago,after ``every grain of possibility for dialogue'' had beenexhausted on winning the release of three Israeli POWs captured insouth Lebanon.   ``We took into consideration all the possible reactions,'' hesaid. ``We saw them all, including the actions that already tookplace, and ones even worse.''   Energy Minister Moshe Shahal later told The Associated Press,however, that the decision to approve the kidnap did not rest onoutside implications. ``Consideration was only given to getting oursoldiers back,'' he said.   The Soviet news agency Tass said Iran's president-elect, HashemiRafsanjani, discussed the Obeid abduction and Higgins' purporteddeath with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze in Tehran.   Tass said Rafsanjani voiced ``deep regret over what has happenedand confirmed that Iran does not have (any) relation to the tragedy...'' It said both men favored ``urgent measures'' to prevent thesituation from worsening.   Iran's main opposition group, the Mujahedeen Khalq, claimedtoday Rafsanjani directly controls the groups holding hostages andthat he dispatched his brother to help oversee their activities,including the ``execution'' of Higgins.</TEXT></DOC>
