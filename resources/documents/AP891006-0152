The argument launched a court challenge by Louisiana officialsseeking to overturn the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decisionlegalizing abortion.   Rachael Pine, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer,countered that there is nothing in the July ruling that justifiesthe revival of three strong anti-abortion statutes struck down in1976.   ``It is as simple today as it was 13 years ago,'' Pine told thethree-judge U.S. District Court panel.   Nearly 100 abortion rights supporters jammed the courtroom,sitting quietly as Pine and other ACLU lawyers argued withrepresentatives of Louisiana Attorney General William Guste and NewOrleans District Attorney Harry Connick, both of whom want to lifta 1976 injunction banning enforcement of the abortion statutes.   Both Connick and Guste, neither of whom attended Friday'shearing, have said their effort is a test case to get a SupremeCourt ruling on whether Louisiana can indeed ban abortion.   The July ruling made state laws the main arena for the battleover abortion. Pennsylvania and Michigan are considered likely toenact new legislation, and lawmakers in Illinois, Michigan andFlorida are expected to take up the issue at special sessions.   Florida's Supreme Court gave abortion rights backers a victoryThursday by striking down a parental consent law on the ground thatit violated Florida's constitutional privacy rights. The attorneygeneral's office in Tallahassee said the state would file apetition for a rehearing next week.   Some people on both sides of the issue said the Florida decisionis so broad that women in the state would have their current rightsto an abortion, even if the U.S. Supreme Court reverses Roe vs.Wade.   If the Louisiana law were enforced, doctors who performabortions would face 10-year jail terms. People who advertiseabortion services or sell drugs or devices to induce abortions alsowould be subject to jail terms and fines.   The laws even ban sale of contraceptives, although Guste said noattempt would be made to enforce that provision.   Critics say the laws make no exceptions for rape or incest, butGuste said abortions in such cases could be considered therapeuticand, therefore, legal.   Pine argued there is no basis for lifting the injunction.   John Baker, an attorney for Connick and a law professor atLouisiana State University, said July's Supreme Court decision in aMissouri case, Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services, changedthe standard by which courts can review abortion laws.   A state now may ban abortions if it proves it has a compellinginterest in protecting the rights of the unborn, he argued.   In Louisiana, such an interest is already established in lawsgiving fetuses the right to collect support payments, win wrongfuldeath suits or inherit property if they are born alive, said Bakerand Jennifer Schaye, a lawyer for Guste.   ``Tort law and inheritance law is not constitutional law,'' Pinesaid later during a news conference.   She also disputed Baker's contention that the Webster opinionchanged the standard of judicial review. She quoted Chief JusticeWilliam Rehnquist's opinion in which he stated specifically thatWebster leaves ``undisturbed'' the 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling.   Baker said the Webster ruling changed Roe's standard of fetalviability _ the point at which the fetus could survive outside thewomb _ from 24 weeks to 20 weeks.   Pine said the Missouri requirement that doctors test for fetalviability at 20 weeks was upheld in Webster because there is afour-week margin for error in determining length of gestation.   Judges William Eugene Davis, Martin L.C. Feldman and A.J.MacNamara gave no indication when or how they would rule in thecase.   Before and after the hearing, abortion rights demonstratorsgathered on the steps of the federal courthouse, chanting andsinging and carrying banners in support of a woman's right toabortion.   They greatly outnumbered a band of about a dozen anti-abortionpickets, most of whom marched quietly in a circle in front of thecourthouse steps while one read Bible verses aloud.   No violent confrontations or arrests were reported.</TEXT></DOC>
