OPM issued interim regulations on July 31, 1979, to implement theprovisions of the Civil Service Reform Act. These proposed regulationswould implement laws enacted since 1979 and take into account commentson the interim regulations. The regulations would provide for the removalof a career appointee from the SES (1) during the probationary period;(2) for less than fully successful executive performance; or (3) as a resultof reduction in force. In addition, these regulations would provide forthe placement in other personnel systems of certain career appointees whoare removed from the SES. The regulations also would cover the removalof noncareer and limited SES appointees, and reemployed annuitants holdingany type of SES appointment. Note that disciplinary removals of careerSES appointees who have completed the SES probationary period are coveredin 5 CFR Part 752, Subpart F.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Written comments will be considered if received no laterthan October 11, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Send or deliver written comments to the Director, Officeof Executive Personnel, OEA, Room 6R48, Office of Personnel Management,1900 E.

The only written comment that OPM received discussedthe need for additional guidance to agencies on taking actions under Part359. OPM also received a number of phone inquiries regarding specific provisions.Before final regulations could be issued, Pub. L. 95-454 was amended byPub. L. 97-35 of August 13, 1981; Pub. L. 97-346 of October 15, 1982; andPub. L. 98-615 of November 8, 1984. These regulations would implement theprovisions of the new laws and take into account questions and commentson the current regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Removal of Career Appointees During Probation (Part 359, Subpart D)</ITAG>In response to a frequently asked question, OPM has amended the regulationsat andSection; 359.402(b) to show that it is not mandatory for an agencyto give an employee a formal unsatisfactory rating under the agency's performanceappraisal system before it can remove a probationer for unacceptable performance.One agency suggested that, in light of the definition of ``employee'' in5 U.S.C. 7541(1)(B), the regulations state that a career SES appointeewho was covered under 5 U.S.C. 7511 immediately before appointment to theSES continues to retain adverse action coverage under 5 U.S.C. 7543 afterappointment. This suggestion was adopted at andSection; 359.403(a)(2).Several agencies called attention to the need for a provision that wouldenable an agency to proceed with a removal action during the 120 days followingthe appointment of a new agency head or a new noncareer supervisor whenthere is reasonable cause to believe that the probationer has committeda crime for which a sentence of imprisonment can be imposed or when thecircumstances are such that retention of the probationer may cause injury,result in property damage, or reflect unfavorably on the Federal service.Part 752, Subpart F, which covers adverse actions against SES career appointeeswho have completed probation, provides for emergency action under the abovementioned circumstances. Since there is no practical or legal reason whyprobationers should be afforded more protections than those granted toappointees who have completed probation, OPM adopted the suggestion andadded the emergency action provision to andSection; 359.406(b).Public Law 97-35 included a number of provisions on the SES affecting probationers.It was the first legislation to establish an authority on reduction-in-force(RIF) actions in the SES, and the removal of a probationer under RIF hasbeen added in andSection; 359.405.Public Law 97-35 also revised the standard, in 5 U.S.C. 7543, that governsthe removal of a post-probationer from the SES for disciplinary reasons.The revised standard read ``misconduct, neglect of duty or malfeasance.''Subsequently, Pub. L. 98-615 clarified the cause of action standard toexpressly include ``failure to accept a directed reassignment or to accompanya position in a tranfer of function.'' As indicated above, certain probationersare subject to the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 7543. Since a uniform causeof action standard should be applicable for all disciplinary actions inthe SES, OPM has amended the standard for taking disciplinary action againstprobationers under andSection; 359.403 to be consistent with the change in5 U.S.C. 7543. Further, since post-probationers who are removed under 5U.S.C. 7543 are not entitled to fallback to GS-15, there are no fallbackrights given to probationers removed for disciplinary reasons.<ITAG tagnum="84">Removal of Career Appointees for Less Than Fully Successful ExecutivePerformance (Part 359, Subpart E)</ITAG>Several agencies have expressed a need for some modification or clarificationof the provisions governing the removal of a post-probationer for lessthan fully successful executive performance. In response, OPM has madethe following changes in Subpart E.(1) The conditions requiring mandatory removal are clarified in andSection;359.501(d).(2) The authority of an agency to remove an employee based on a formalsummary rating when the appraisal period has been shortened is clarifiedin andSection; 359.501(d) by dropping the term ``annual'' in conjunctionwith mandatory removals based on two less than fully successful ratings.In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 4315(b)(1)(D), an appraisal period ``may beterminated in any case in which the agency making an appraisal determinesthat an adequate basis exists on which to appraise and rate the seniorexecutive's performance.'' Because the term ``annual'' rating was usedin the interim regulations, however, it was not clear whether a ratingbased on a shortened appraisal period was to be considered a final ratingfor removal purposes. It is apparent, nevertheless, that the intent ofthe law was to allow removal; otherwise, there would be no reason to providefor the shortened period. The period, of course, must meet any minimumrequirements established by OPM and the agency performance appraisal plan.Further, the rating must meet all other requirements of law and regulations,including opportunity for higher-level review and a recommendation by thePerfoormance Review Board.(3) A provision for the optional use of a supplementary notice to advisea post-probationer of the position to which he or she will be assignedis added at andSection; 359.502(a)(2). The supplementary notice must be issuedat least 10 days before the effective date of the removal action. The changewill permit an agency to initiate a removal action for performance reasonswhile the placement decision is being made final.<ITAG tagnum="84">Removal of Career Appointees as a Result of Reduction in Force (Part359, Subpart F)</ITAG>As noted above, Pub. L. 97-35 of August 13, 1981, provided for the firsttime specific statutory authority (5 U.S.C. 3595) for RIFs in the SES.It included provisions on placement assistance by OPM and on appeal rightsto the Merit System Protection Board. It was amended by Pub. L. 97-346of October 15, 1982, and then again by Pub. L. 98-615 of November 8, 1984.The major changes in the latest amendments were (1) to reduce the OPM placementperiod from 120 to 45 days for appointees who had completed the probationeryperiod; (2) to delete the 30-day notification to the Congress for certainappointees; (3) to provide ``fallback'' to no lower than GS-15 with savedpay for appointees who could not be placed elsewhere in the SES; (4) torestrict appeal rights to the Merit Systems Protection Board to agencycompetitive procedures. The ``fallback'' provisions are covered in SubpartG. The other provisions are covered under Subpart F, as discussed below.The regulations require that an agency issue written procedures beforeinitiating a RIF action. After the procedures are issued, agencies arerequired to provide OPM a copy so that OPM can maintain a clearinghouseof RIF plans.The regulations make it clear that all career appointees, including thoseserving a probationary period, are subject to RIF competitive procedures.(A reemployed annuitant, however, serving under a career appointment isexcluded from coverage.) The competitive procedures must be based primarilyon performance.Career appointees who have completed the SES probationary period, or whowere not required to serve one, are entitled to be placed in another SESposition in their agency for which they qualify. If there is no such position,the agency head certifies the appointee to OPM for placement assistance.OPM has 45 days in which to try to place the appointee in an SES position.The OPM placement program will take into account the congressional sectionanalysis for Pub. L. 98-615, which states, ``It is hoped the new placementprogram would be more of a cooperative effort than the current placementprogram. OPM is to design this placement program to minimize the disruptionof recruitment of vacancies in other agencies.''The regulations provide that agencies shall respond to any referral withinthe time period prescribed by OPM. To assist individuals in the shortenedplacement period and to minimize for agencies the time vacancies may be``frozen,'' the response time will normally be 5 workdays. As providedin law, the head of the agency has the authority to determine whether anindividual is qualified for a vacancy. Nevertheless, the regulations provideauthority for OPM to take corrective action if an agency fails to providebona fide consideration.The regulations provide a minimum 45-day RIF notice before removal fromthe SES for career appointees who have completed their probationary period.This means the notice normally should be issued no later than the datewhen an appointee is referred to OPM for placement assistance. A secondnotice may be needed to provide a specific removal date if the individualcannot be placed in the SES.If the appointee cannot be placed in the SES, or declines a placement offer,the appointee is entitled to fallback rights at no lower than GS-15, asdiscussed under Subpart G. (An individual is entitled to discontinued serviceretirement in lieu of fallback if the age and service requirements forsuch retirement are met.)Pub. L. 98-615 also amended 5 U.S.C. 3595 to provide that career appointeesaffected by a transfer of function between agencies should have rightssimilar to those of employees in the competitive service. In the competitiveservice, employees are entitled to transfer with their function to thegaining agency if they would otherwise be subject to a RIF in the losingagency. (Part 351, Subpart D.) A similar provision was adopted for theSES in andSection; 359.608.<ITAG tagnum="84">Guaranteed Placement (Part 213, Section 3202; Part 359, Subpart G;Part 536, Subpart A)</ITAG>Under the CSRA, guaranteed placement outside the SES as provided only forcertain employees removed during their probationary period and for post-probationersremoved for performance reasons. Public Law 98-615 amended 5 U.S.C. 3594to provide fallback rights also for career appointees in a RIF action whohave completed the probationary period, or did not have to serve one. Formerly,removal was from the civil service entirely. Now, an appointee affectedby a RIF will be entitled to fallback if during the 45-day OPM placementperiod the appointee declines a placement offer in another SES positionor cannot be placed in another SES position. (An appointee may accept fallbackto GS-15 before the end of 45-day placement period if he voluntarily acceptsthe action in writing.)The provisions in law governing fallback in a RIF are the same as thosegoverning fallback when removal is for less than fully successful performance.The regulations, therefore, are also the same. Thus, the appointee is entitledto be placed in a continuing position at no lower than GS-15; the placementaction may not cause the separation or reduction in grade of any otherindividual; and the appointee is entitled to saved pay.As far as saved pay is concerned, since 5 U.S.C. 3594 now specificallyprovides pay retention (but not grade retention) in SES RIF, the regulatoryprovisions to be followed are those in Part 359, not the grade and payretention provisions in Part 536, which were previously applicable. OPMis amending 5 CFR 536.105 to exclude SES members from grade retention underPart 536 in all instances and from pay retention under Part 536 when anindividual is receiving pay retention under 5 U.S.C. 3594. The regulationscontinue to permit agencies to exercise their discretionary authority,however, under 5 CFR 536.104(b) to grant pay retention in RIF situationswhen the individual is not entitled to pay retention under 5 U.S.C. 3594,e.g., when the individual voluntarily accepts a GS-15 position followingreceipt of a general RIF notice or a notice of position abolishment.It should be noted that in RIF situations, if the affected executive cannotbe placed in the SES, it is the agency conducting the RIF that is responsiblefor placing the appointee in a GS-15 or higher position within the agencyor arranging a transfer to such a position in another agency. However,any transfer must be mutually acceptable to the appointee and the gainingagency.If the agency conducting the RIF is being terminated and there is no transferof function, employment of SES members ceases upon the termination dateunless Congress have provided in legislation for mandatory placement inanother agency following termination or the members have obtained positionselsewhere under SES RIF placement procedures.If the agency conducting the RIF will remain in existence, but has no vacantposition currently available at GS-15 or above for which the individualqualifies and cannot make a placement in another agency, the agency stillmust create a position to permit the fallback. The agency should then continueits efforts to find an appropriate position for the individual either internallyor in another agency. If that does not prove possible, only then can theagency conduct a further RIF action. Such an action may not be taken withinthree months of the removal from the SES. That is the same period providedin Part 351 (5 CFR 351.701(a)) as the minimum length of time a positionmust last when an employee is assigned to another position under RIF proceduresoutside the SES.It should be noted that the congressional section analysis for Pub. L.98-615 states that although appointees are entitled to placement followinga RIF within the SES, this entitlement does not apply for subsequent RIFsoutside the SES. Such subsequent actions would be subject to the regulationsin Part 351 of this chapter.There is the question of the tenure of the appointment outside the SESto be given a post-probationer who does not have reinstatement rights inthe competitive service. In the situation, the individual must be placedin a position in the excepted service. Two cases are involved here. Thefirst case involves an individual who came to the SES from an exceptedservice appointment, e.g., Schedule A, B, or C, or an agency excepted appointmentauthority. In that case the individual could return to his or her formerappointment (e.g., as SES attorney who had come from a GS-15 Schedule Aappointment could return to that appointment). The second case involvesan individual who has not been in the civil service prior to the SES appointment.In that case, unless there was an existing excepted appointment authoritythat could be used, OPM has been approving special, single agency ScheduleB authorities. By amendment of Part 213, OPM would provide a government-wideSchedule B authority to cover this situation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Furloughs in the Senior Executive Service (Part 359, Subpart H)</ITAG>Public Law 98-615 established for the first time in statute specific provisionson furlough in the SES under 5 U.S.C. 3595a. These provisions define furloughs,state that career SES appointees may be furloughed only under regulationsissued by OPM, and provide an appeal right for career appointees to theMerit Systems Protection Board.OPM earlier issued furlough regulations in Part 359, Subpart H, for careerSES appointees based on its general authority to regulate for the SES (48FR 11925, March 2, 1983). Those regulations include the provisions thatwere incorporated in 5 U.S.C. 3595a. Therefore, no new regulations arenecessary; and agencies should continue to apply the current regulationsin Subpart H.<ITAG tagnum="84">Removal of Noncareer and Limited Appointees and Reemployed Annuitants(Part 359, Subpart I)</ITAG>This subpart, issued in the interim regulations as Subpart F, would berenumbered as Subpart I and retitled. It continues earlier coverage ofnoncareer, limited term, and limited emergency appointees (except for certainlimited appointees who would be covered by 5 CFR Part 752, Subpart F, underproposed regulations issued May 30, 1986). It also adds coverage of reemployedannuitants with career appointments.A reemployed annuitant serves at the will of the appointing authority.Thus, a reemployed annuitant who is serving under an SES career appointmentis not entitled to the protections afforded by Subparts D, E, F, and G;and removal procedures are to be governed by Subpart I.In summary, a new section is added to Part 213 to provide a Schedule Bappointment authority for SES performance and RIF fallback when an individualdoes not have reinstatement eligibility in the competitive service; Part536 is revised to exclude SES members from grade retention coverage inall instances and from pay retention coverage when they are entitled topay retention under 5 U.S.C. 3594; and Part 359 is amended as follows:(a) Subpart A, which repeated the pertinent sections of title 5, UnitedStates Code, is revoked and reserved for future use.(b) In Subpart B, an addition to andSection; 359.202 defines ``reemployedannuitant.''(c) In Subpart D, (1) an addition to andSection; 359.402 clarifies the basisfor an action to remove a probationer for unsatisfactory performance; (2)the cause of action standard in andSection; 359.403 for removal of probationersis revised to agree with the standard in Part 752, Subpart F; (3) pertinentreferences to 5 U.S.C. 7511 are added to andSection;andSection; 359.403 and359.404; (4) a new andSection; 359.405 is added to regulate the removal ofprobationers from the SES under a RIF; (5) provisions for emergency actionunder specific circumstances are added to andSection; 359.406 as an exceptionto the 120-day moratorium on removals following the appointment of a newagency head or noncareer supervisor; and (6) another addition to andSection;359.406 makes it clear that the imposition of a 120-day moratorium on removalsdoes not extend the probationary period.(d) In Subpart E, (1) the conditions requiring mandatory removal for performancefrom the SES as set forth in andSection; 359.501 are clarified; (2) the noticerequirements under andSection; 359.502(a) are amended to permit an agencyto use a supplementary notice to advise a post-probationer of his or herplacement outside the SES; and (3) the former andSection; 359.505 on appealsis renumbered andSection; 359.504.(e) The former Subpart F is renumbered as Subpart I. The new Subpart Fcovers removal of career appointees in a RIF.(f) In Subpart G, placement rights are added for RIF actions.(g) The new Subpart I covers removal of noncareer and limited appointees,as well as reemployed annuitants.<ITAG tagnum="84">E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation</ITAG>I have determined that this is not a major rule as defined under Section1(b) of E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities because it will only affect Governmentemployees who are members of the Senior Executive Service.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>5 CFR Part 213Government employees.5 CFR Part 359Government employees.5 CFR Part 536Administrative practice and procedure, Government employees, Wages.<ITAG tagnum="20">U.S. Office of Personnel Management.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Constance Horner,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director.</ITAG>Accordingly, OPM is proposing to amend 5 CFR Parts 213, 359 and 536 asfollows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 213_EXCEPTED SERVICE</ITAG>1.
