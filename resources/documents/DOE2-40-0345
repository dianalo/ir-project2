The sources of power generation, both manufacturedby EESI, are a Winco three-phase 55 kW diesel generator set and two 12.5Jacobs wind energy systems. The wind turbines have variable speed synchronousgenerators and single-phase line-commutated inverters. The wind systemsand diesel generator set are tied in parallel to provide power to theengineering facility. The invertors have been modified to allow a programmablecontroller to alter the field voltage of the synchronous generator. Developmenttesting has provided information on the interaction of the wind systems,diesel generators and loads. Test data collected includes power production,fuel flow, and harmonic distortion. During operation, the wind has providedfrom 0 to 90% of the power to the load. The hybrid system has been operatedcontinuously since October, 1985, except for maintenance on the dieselgenerator. A programmable controller has been used to logically controlthe wind energy systems and loads. The tests have proven that a wind-dieselhybrid power system is technically feasible and a viable alternative.3 refs., 6 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
