3) You're just plain tired of howlong it takes to run your existing accounting package.andM;You want new hardware and you want it now!andP;  What do you get?andP;  First andforemost, remember this: The speed and efficiency of a database applicationis machine dependent.andP;  The more complex the application, the more data to beprocessed and moved around.andP;  The more processing you do, the more criticalthe processor selection, amount of memory, and hard disk type--and the moreimportant performance becomes.andM;Second, database applications don't work like word processing applications.andO;Like databases, word processors operate on most computers.andP;  But the basicconstraint for word processors is how fast you can type.andP;  Databaseapplication users, on the other hand, are extremely critical about the timeit takes to do something with data.andP;  In the database world, if the userspends more than a few moments to find and display a record, you'll hearabout it!andM;So where do you get this speed?andP;  Start with the proper processor.andM;Old timerandM;The 8088/86 series processors were the first used in the IBM PC.andP;  And you canstill find them around--at bargain rates.andP;  The 8088/86-based system canhandle small flat-file database work, such as managing a mailing list with10,000 or fewer records.andP;  (Naturally you'll want a machine with a harddrive.)andP;  If you want to use this type of machine, configure it minimally with640K of RAM and a 20M hard drive.andP;  How fast can it chug along?andP;  Speeds rangefrom 4.77 MHz to the &quot;turbo&quot; 10MHz.andP;  Of course, faster means better.andP;  8088salso make quite serviceable terminals for telecommunications or other remoteoperations.andP;  The performance here is generally limited by the data transferrate across telephone lines.andM;Middle aged and serviceableandM;Machines using the 80826 CPU, commonly called &quot;ATs,&quot; have become theworkhorses of the industry.andP;  This processor manipulates data six to 25 timesfaster than the 8088/86.andP;  If outfitted with adequate memory, a quick harddrive of 35 milliseconds (ms) or faster, and a high-performance hard-diskcontroller, a 286 can manage as a good light load network server andexcellent single-user database system.andP;  Although 286 processors come inspeeds up to 25 MHz, most run at 8, 10, 12, or 16 MHz.andM;Regardless of how much you're devoted to your workhorse, though, it can'twork as well as a 80386 when it comes to true multiuser situations.andP;  Softwarewritten specifically for the 386 can take advantage of many features thatallow extra speed and an extra margin of safety.andM;386-somethingandM;Looking for the optimum processor for running your medium to large databaseapplication?andP;  For the price, an 80386 fits the bill just fine.andP;  The 386 runsDOS programs no faster than a 286 at the same clock rates.andP;  However, the 386has the ability to multi-task and handle large amounts of memory moreefficiently than the 286.andP;  If you use special software written to takeadvantage of these features, you'll see an evident increase in the speed ofdatabase operations many times over a 286.andP;  For database work, a 386 runningspecial 386 network software makes for an excellent server in large networksituations (50-plus users).andM;When choosing a 386, you should note one thing: The actual speed of 386soperating at the same clock rate will vary depending on whether the unityou're looking at has &quot;a cache memory&quot; or not.andP;  A system using cache memorywill be many times faster than one that doesn't.andP;  If you can afford a 386with cache memory or if you find the price differences to be very slim,select the machine with the cache.andM;Since we're on the subject of 386s, we should note that pretender to thethrone, the 80386SX.andP;  This processor runs 386 software using the 286 16-bitmemory.andP;  This may make it as capable as a 386 to handle the overall datamanagement job, but speed-wise, the SX runs as slow as a 286 when yourapplication requires a lot of memory work.andM;If cost and 386 compatibility are factors, but speed isn't, consider the SX.andO;These days though, real savings are debatable; you can usually buy an SX foronly a few hundred dollars less than a real 386.andM;SprinterandM;For high-speed, power-packed database work, put your foot to the fast pedalof this CPU.andP;  Although a system built around the 486 can be cost effectivefor large, multiuser database applications and servers, it's too expensive todon't recommend as a personal workstation.andM;Math genius?andM;Unless your applications do lots of number crunching, don't bother buying amath coprocessor.andP;  As you can see from the Database Management SoftwareChart, most of the current packages don't take advantage of the chip.andP;  Ofthose that do, the majority use it only for scientific calculations.andP;  Notethe exceptions on the chart that place greater importance on having a mathcoprocessor.andP;  Advanced Revelation, for example, uses one extensively.andM;If you're shopping for a server machine, network software presently doesn'ttake advantage of the math chip, so don't spend the money.andM;A side note: if the language of choice takes appreciable advantage of themath chip, but you're installing a low speed network for your office databasesystem, the math chip's speed increase may be swallowed up while your systemwaits to receive data.andP;  Be sure you match options to your drive train.andM;How much memory is enough?andM;When dealing out RAM chips, remember: 640K in a workstation is an absoluteminimum.andP;  There's no right answer for network servers; it depends on yournetwork software.andP;  For 286s and faster, we recommend a minimum of 1M ofDOS/extended memory for a 286 and 4M for a 386.andP;  A 386 becomes quite flexiblewhen using available memory management software, such as QEMM.andP;  Extendedmemory under a 286 is much more limited.andM;What about the hard disk?andM;Most simple, single-user applications require nothing more than a 20M or 30Mdrive.andP;  If you're more ambitious in your software and application needs,consider a 40M drive.andP;  (dBASE IV takes 6.5M of disk, XENIX close to 15M, andWindows over 2M without data storage considerations.)andM;When selecting drives for large systems, calculate how much storage space youactually need for a year's worth of data, then add room for extra storage incase business booms, then double that.andP;  Note that the usage of disk spaceaccelerates as new applications become available.andP;  (Software gets &quot;bigger&quot;all the time).andP;  How fast should your disk be?andP;  These days, 20 ms hard diskshave become de rigueur--especially for disk-intensive applications.andM;If you want top performance from your database server, consider a cachingcontroller, such as those made by Distributed Processing Technology.andP;  Thesecontrollers are specifically designed for database work and operate as&quot;parallel processors&quot; carrying their own on-board CPU and cache memory.andP;  Theycan modify their performance characteristics by continually re-evaluating ofpast disk operations, without interfering with your regular CPU.andP;  With thesecontrollers you'll always receive optimal performance.andM;Finally, remember to match your hard drive/hard disk controller/processortype and speed carefully.andP;  Spending $2,500 on a 300M ESDI drive/controlleronly to plug it into a 6MHz AT is not money well spent.andP;  Likewise, neither isbuying a 65 ms drive for a 386.andP;  As you buy machines whose processors arematched for your work, buy drives whose speed neither sits wasted nor holdsback your system.andM;So how fast is fast?andM;Naturally, the term &quot;fast&quot; is a relative.andP;  And the only way to determinespeed is by reading performance benchmarks.andP;  Although benchmarks can tell youwhat your hardware does under a set of static conditions, testing a machinefor database applications is like trying to explain a black hole.andM;First, nobody can agree on what an &quot;average real world application&quot; is,thereby precluding the testing of one.andM;Second, nobody can agree on what the standard machine should be for testing.andO;How about a 25MHz 386?andP;  No?andP;  Then a 20 MHz 286?andP;  Well, then maybe just a 4.77MHz 8088?andP;  Should we allow testing with or without a math co-processor?andP;  Howbig should the hard disk be?andP;  What type of controller?andP;  Which DOS?andP;  How manyBUFFERS and FILES in CONFIG.SYS?andP;  Selecting a machine as &quot;standard&quot; isolatesmost users, and causes some manufacturers to scream &quot;too slow&quot; or &quot;invalidtesting procedures.&quot;andM;Third, we've found that machines excelling under accepted benchmarks tests,such as PC Magazine's version 5.1 tests, may not perform as well when itcomes to working with database systems because of poor hard disk/controllermatching.andP;  Database applications gather their data randomly; benchmarks testsequential disk operation (e.g., how fast can a drive read or write the same64K block of data at the same disk location?).andM;As you read benchmark results, remember: Benchmarks only give you a generalidea of system hardware performance.andP;  They can't tell how an application isgoing to run.andP;  You can only find that out by setting up the application andrunning it.andP;  Machine performance during database work is dynamic--it changesfrom moment to moment depending on the work being done.andP;  These dynamics makeobtaining qualitative static results impossible.andM;Where does database softwareandM;stand?andM;In the Database Management Software Chart, you'll find many of the majorplayers in the database field.andP;  The chart indicates the following:andM;* The amount of free DOS memory needed for an average applicationandM;This will help you in figuring out how much memory you must have, after DOSand network software, to run the product.andP;  Note that some products suggest arange, since they may consist of more than one operational program.andM;* Whether extended memory isused, and if so, for whatandM;This will help you figure out how much extended memory to add to your system(or if it is worth adding at all).andM;* Whether expanded memory is used, and if so for whatandM;This will help you in figuring out how much expanded memory to add to yoursystem (or, again, if it is worth having at all).andM;* Whether a math coprocessor used, and if so for whatandM;The Network Chart indicates the following:andM;* The amount of memory used at a workstation/nodeandM;This figure, plus the amount used by the particular DOS version you'rerunning, will give you the maximum amount of free memory you can expect to beavailable on the workstation.andP;  Use this figure to see if your favoritesoftware can run on your network of choice or to figure out what softwarewill run on which network combo.andM;* The amount of memory and type required for a network server to operate,asedon an average small office of less than eight users.andM;This will tell you how much memory you need to have in your server to make itoperate efficiently under your network of choice.andM;* The base system recommendedandM;This tells you what each network software manufacturer recommends for abare-bones, bottom-of-the-line system configuration to run as a server.andM;How can you use the information in both charts?andP;  If you're going to put anetwork together and haven't chosen one yet, or you have a network and needto choose a database system, use the charts to tell you what will fit withwhat.andM;Here's an example of how to use the two charts together.andP;  Let's say you'reusing a 3Com+ network, running DOS 4.01 on your stations.andP;  This DOS takes88K, and 3Com+ requires 120K, leaving you 432K free on a 640K computer.andO;Looking at the Database Management System Chart, you'll find that you won'tbe able to run such products as dBASE IV, D the Data Language, R:BASE, orSQLBase (and it'll be touch and go with others, such as Alpha Four, dBXL, andFoxPro).andP;  If you wanted to be dBASE compatible, you might consider dBASE IIIPLUS, which takes only 256K.andM;Putting it all togetherandM;Building a hardware system that handles database work as fast and asefficiently as possible is no small chore.andP;  Remember, the components to honein on for optimum database processing speed are the processor, memory, andhard disk.andP;  For more information about each, read on.andP;  The time you investhere can add up to considerable savings on the time you invest with thatmolasses-slow application.andM;p.c.andP;
