Bush, in a White House ceremony, said it was time to ``break thegridlock'' over new clean air legislation that has lasted for adecade.   But environmentalists and their congressional supporterscomplained that said the president's plan would ease an earlydraft's requirements for reducing motor vehicle pollution andprovide wide government latitude to meet industry concerns.   The president said government must ``see to it that everyAmerican in every city in America will breathe clean air'' andadded his plan would ``take the lead'' in reaching that goal.   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chief Senate sponsor of clean-airlegislation, said the final language of Bush's bill ``willsignificantly tarnish his image to be the environmental president.''   ``The president stepped up to the problem, blinked and steppedback,'' Baucus said, contending the bill would increase motorvehicle emissions, allow cities too much time to clean air and givetoo much weight to cost in toxic chemical cleanup.   Bush, at a White House photo session, declined to answer areporter's question about the criticisms. But press secretaryMarlin Fitzwater said it was regrettable that the criticisms weregetting the bill off to a ``rocky start.''   ``We're very proud of this bill. We think it's a good one, andwe think the environmental community thinks it's a good one as well... overall you'll find that their support is very strong,'' hesaid.   Fitzwater denied there was any watering down of the bill, andsaid it was tougher overall than any current proposals on CapitolHill.   An Environmental Protection Agency summary of the legislationgiven to members of Congress Thursday showed the final version waschanged from a preliminary draft written June 30.   The language, compared to the earlier draft, would push back newemissions standards for cars, trucks and buses, and would give theEPA administrator discretion to delay new regulations even further.   Other provisions would give the administrator, local governmentsand industry flexibility in taking measures to reduce ozonepollution, acid rain and airborne toxic chemicals. In making keydecisions, the EPA chief could address industry's costs.   Richard Ayres, head of a coalition of environmental groups, saidthe flexibility was a prescription for ``chicanery and fraud'' byindustry. He said acid rain components would be reduced less thanpromised, and giving weight to economic concerns would reduce theeffectiveness of provisions to control toxic emissions.   But EPA Administrator William Reilly, who would make many keydecisions under the legislation, called the bill ``faithful inevery respect to the spirit and letter of the promises he (Bush)made'' to clean the nation's air.   Rep. Henry Waxman, chairman of the House Energy and Commerceenvironment subcommittee, called the final language ``weaker thanlast month's draft, which was far weaker than the president'spromises.''   ``It undercuts the clean fuel program, pushes back compliancedeadlines and loosens emissions standards. The bill actuallyappears to allow emissions from cars and trucks to increase fromtoday's levels,'' Waxman said.   According to the summary, new buses operated in cities with morethan 1 million population would be required to use clean-burningfuel. The June 30 draft would have imposed the requirement on allcities of 250,000 or more.   While the bus program would be phased in over the 1991 through1994 model years, the EPA administrator would have the authority todelay the plan for two years for economic reasons.   The EPA administrator, for economic reasons, could revise andpostpone for two years a clean-fuel program for cars _ acornerstone of the Bush program.   The bill would establish a schedule requiring sale of clean-fuelcars, beginning in the 1995 model year, in the most heavilypolluted cities. One million of these cars would be sold in each ofthe model years 1997 through 2004.   The deadline for all cars to meet new emissions standards forhydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides was pushed back _ from the 1994model year in the previous draft to the 1995 models in the finalversion.   The June 30 draft also had tougher emissions standards for lightand heavy trucks, and the deadline for meeting the new requirementswas pushed back for the light trucks _ such as pickups _ from 1993to a phased-in period ending with 1995 models.   Criminal penalties against auto makers, for violating theanti-pollution emission standards, were in the draft bill but notin the new version.   Other provisions in the final bill would:   _Allow the EPA administrator discretion to override deadlinesfor ozone cleanup in cities, including doubling the cleanup timefrom 10 to 20 years. But such cities would have to show steadyprogress over the longer period of time after receiving theextension.   _Require a 10-million-ton reduction from 1980 levels of sulfurdioxide, a key ingredient of acid rain. Nitrogen oxide, the otherkey ingredient, would be reduced by 2 million tons from the levelsthat would have been reached by the year 2000.   Environmentalists argued the nitrogen oxide figure is not reallya reduction, just a smaller growth rate. And they pointed out thesulfur dioxide reduction would be only 9 million tons since theadministration is counting a 1 million ton reduction alreadyachieved.   _Permit auto makers to average the car emissions to achieve newanti-pollution standards, a tactic environmentalists said would notbring about a reduction. The EPA contended it would writeregulations to make the program effective.   _Permit auto and petroleum companies to propose alternative waysto reduce pollution, a plan Ayres said would be ``a floating crapgame'' that would lead to delay. EPA officials said they wouldestablish tough regulations to prevent industry from stretchingdeadlines.   _Require maximum available control technology for toxicemissions, but require that cost, the feasibility of installing thetechnology and energy requirements be taken into account.Environmentalists said these considerations negated the technologystandards, but the EPA disagreed.</TEXT></DOC>
