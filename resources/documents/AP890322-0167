By a vote of 5-0, the commissioners passed with little discussionan ordinance making it illegal to own semi-automatic weapons capableof firing 20 rounds without reloading.   Los Angeles and other communities have banned assault weaponssince a drifter with an AK-47 opened fire on a schoolyard inStockton, Calif., on Jan. 17, killing five children and injuring 30other people before killing himself.   The proposal to ban such weapons in Dayton led to death threatsagainst sponsor Tony Capizzi and drew an overflow crowd of opponentsat last week's meeting.   About 150 people sat in commission chambers today, while 30 morelistened over a loudspeaker in a lobby.   ``This legislation does not take away your right to ownweapons,'' Capizzi argued. ``It takes away certain rights to ownspecific types of assault weapons.''   Mayor Richard Clay Dixon, a member of the commission, said theban is needed to protect police in their fight against street crime,but opponents said the ban will nothing to disarm drug dealers andother criminals.</TEXT></DOC>
