The price, which doesn't include additional sums Sun will pay for working capital and inventory, would give Mr. Deuss a profit larger than his Brent crude trading losses. Mr. Deuss had acquired the 130,000 barrel-a-day Philadelphia refinery and related facilities from Atlantic Richfield Co. in September 1985 for $192 million.    Mr. Deuss's agreement to sell to a U.S. oil company came as a surprise. It was known he was trying to sell all or part of the refinery in recent months. But it is understood he had been trying to negotiate the sale with oil-exporting states such as Abu Dhabi and Venezuela, which are seeking to expand their ownership of &quot;downstream,&quot; or refining and marketing, assets.    Indeed, according to Mr. Deuss, &quot;the discussions with Sun evolved very quickly into a meeting of the minds&quot; with respect to terms. &quot;Once we got the deal we wanted,&quot; he added, &quot;we felt that the proper thing to do was to go forward with Sun and not wait for the outcome of other alternatives we were pursuing.&quot;    Sun confirmed, meanwhile, that it is still negotiating with Nigeria toward sale of an interest in its refining operations. &quot;We have agreed to explore ways for Nigeria's national oil company to take an equity position in Sun Refining andamp; Marketing,&quot; a spokesman said.    In fact, Mr. Deuss suggested that such moves by oil exporters raised questions of how independent refiners in the U.S. could compete with the producing countries in the downstream markets and helped convince him it was time to sell the Atlantic refinery. He cited the recently disclosed plan of Saudi Arabia to buy a 50% interest in the Eastern U.S. downstream assets of Texaco Inc.    &quot;The entry into the U.S. refining and marketing by major oil-producing countries and the announcement of the Texaco-Saudi deal contributed to our decision to sell Atlantic,&quot; Mr. Deuss said. &quot;I believe that Sun and Atlantic combined will be more successful in facing the uncertainties introduced as a result of the downstream participation by oil-producing countries.&quot;    The refining and marketing subsidiary of Radnor, Pa.-based Sun currently has four U.S. refineries-the biggest in Marcus Hook, Pa. Total capacity of the four refineries is 460,000 barrels a day. The unit markets gasoline through some 6,000 stations in the eastern half of the U.S.    The transaction with Mr. Deuss would include Atlantic Refining andamp; Marketing Corp., which owns the Philadelphia refinery and 571 service stations and convenience stores, and Atlantic Pipeline Corp., which operates a 1,000-mile products pipeline system. The assets are located primarily in Pennsylvania and New York state. Also included would be associated terminals and supply contracts with more than 400 Atlantic outlets owned by dealers and jobbers.    &quot;This acquisition is consistent with our objective of strengthening the company's position in refining and marketing,&quot; said Robert McClements Jr., Sun's chairman.    These are the facilities Mr. Deuss bought from Atlantic Richfield and operated as Atlantic Petroleum Corp. A New York spokesman for Atlantic Refining said the transaction wouldn't include Atlantic Fuels Marketing, another property owned by Mr. Deuss. Atlantic Fuels markets residual and fuel oil in New England.    The acquisition &quot;fits extremely well in Sun's existing configuration and lends additional strength to our overall refining and marketing efforts,&quot; said Robert H. Campbell, president of Sun Refining andamp; Marketing.    Wall Street viewed the development as positive for Sun. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Sun stock rose $2.25 to close at $55.625.    According to Sun, which expects a closing in September, the transaction is subject to review by the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department. It said the acquisition will be made with the purchase of all the shares of Atlantic Petroleum Maatschappij B.V., a Netherlands holding company owned by Mr. Deuss.    Although Mr. Deuss has denied that there was any connection between his January trading losses and the pending sale of the refinery, he has recently restructured his Transworld Oil trading operations. Staffs have been trimmed, and some offices have been closed or consolidated. But the trading operations will continue &quot;to play a major role in our business,&quot; Mr. Deuss said. And he didn't rule out a possible return to refining later.    &quot;The Atlantic experience demonstrated our capability to identify and analyze refining and marketing assets and to acquire and operate them successfully,&quot; he said. &quot;We will certainly be looking for opportunities to use this expertise either on our own or in partnership with others.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
