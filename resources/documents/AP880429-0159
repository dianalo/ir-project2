Dr. Marty E. Sawaya, a researcher at the University of MiamiSchool of Medicine, said she and colleagues have determined thathair follicles that cease growing hair have a high ratio of asingle-molecule protein that is able to carrying the male hormonetestosterone into the cell nucleus and ``short circuit'' hairgrowth.   Ms. Sawaya told a news conference at a meeting of the Societyfor Investigative Dermatology that the discovery was made after shewas able to separate out cells from scalp plugs from men atdifferent stages of hair loss.   The physician said cells vigorously growing hair contain a highratio of a protein she called a tetramer, which has four moleculesclosely bound together.   But in scalp cells growing hair weakly or not at all, she said,the tetramer ratio is very low and a type of protein she called amonomer, or a single molecule of protein, was dominant.   Ms. Sawaya said it appears the monomer is able to penetrate thenucleus of the hair cell and affect the genetic pattern of the cellthat directs the growth of hair. The tetramer protein, however, isunable to enter the cell nucleus.   Also, she said, the monomer is four times more able to bind withtestosterone than is the tetramer.   In other studies, a Miami research team was able to isolate aninhibitor protein that tends to block binding of the male hormoneand the monomer, Ms. Sawaya said. This binding is thought to be animportant step in the process that leads to a halt in hair growth.   Ms. Sawaya said she now is attempting to purify and eventuallysynthesize this inhibitor protein. This protein possibly could beadministered to men who are starting to go bald and thereby stopthe process, she said.   ``I would hope we could have something like that in the nextfive to 10 years,'' she said. ``There'll be nothing any sooner thanthat.''   Ms. Sawaya said her research group has found a way to change theprotein ratios in the cells and that this technology mighteventually be applied to assist in the permanent removal ofunwanted hair, such as on the face of a woman.   Dr. Vera Price, a clinical professor at the University ofCalifornia, San Francisco, praised the work by Ms. Sawaya as``tremendously interesting. She has carried it (explanation ofbaldness) a little bit further. It is an important next step.''   Ms. Price said the research clearly shows how the balance ofprotein types changes in hair follicles as they becomeprogressively shorter.   Normal, hair-growing follicles are long and filled with a thickhair shaft. But follicles become progressively shorter and the hairshaft thinner as the protein ratio shifts.   Dr. David A. Norris, a dermatology researcher at the Universityof Colorado in Denver, said Ms. Sawaya's work has been examined bya peer review group and found to be ``well founded.''   ``It is an important extension of our understanding of the localeffects that cause male pattern baldness,'' he said.   About 70 percent of all men over age 60 experience some form ofmale pattern baldness, and for many the hair loss starts in the 20sand 30s. Hair loss is also a problem with 10 percent to 15 percentof the adult female population.   The Society of Investigative Dermatology is a 50-year-oldorganization of scientists specializing in rersearch of skindisorders.</TEXT></DOC>
