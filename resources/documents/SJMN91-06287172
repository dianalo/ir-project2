What they see is her hair, and sometimes they don't view itfavorably.;   &quot;People say, 'Oh, I used to wear my hair like that . . . in the'70s,' &quot; Barney says.;   &quot;I think I present an image of someone who feels goodabout being an African-American. They ought to see who I am by the way I carrymyself and what I talk about.&quot;;   Ought to, yes, but don't.;   Forgenerations, black men and women have used hot combs and chemicals tostraighten or relax their hair. Comedian Redd Foxx once described that look onhimself as &quot;fried, dyed and laid to the side.&quot;;   Natural values; Natural hairenjoyed a renaissance in the 1960s and early 1970s, when some blacks beganquestioning the white and European values of beauty that many of them hadgrown up with.;   Today, most black women who wear naturals -- like Barney --do so less for overt political reasons and more for sheer convenience. Yet byfreeing themselves from straightening their hair they also wind up paying aprice.;   Some say they're ridiculed by other blacks for clinging to thetrappings of the '60s black power movement, that they're discriminated againstin the workplace and shunned by men who measure beauty by the length of awoman's hair.;   &quot;What's happened is, European-Americans have taught us thatour hair isn't beautiful. African-American people are always going to beenslaved until they accept themselves, including their hair,&quot; says MaxineHankins Cain, an elementary school principal in Lansing.;   &quot;If we could feelgood as a nation of people, we'd have no need to try to imitate or simulateanyone else,&quot; she says. &quot;I have no desire to make my lips or nose thinner orstraighten my hair. Whatever I have now is that which is God-sent.&quot;;   Cainhasn't had a permanent since 1969. But she remembers well the little girlwhose curls were tamed.;   &quot;I recall my mother burning my ears and my foreheadwith that straightening comb. I spent hours sitting by the stove while mymother heated it and ran it through my hair, trying to make me look likesomeone I wasn't. She didn't approve when I started to wear my hair natural.&quot;;  Barney recalls years of not-so-slight turmoil in her home when her motherwore a natural.;   &quot;My father was pastoring at a church that was fairlyconservative, and people were really distraught over my mother's hair,&quot; Barneyrecalls. &quot;Finally, the pressure got too great for him and he asked her, 'Baby,aren't you ever going to press your hair?' When she saw how badly my fatherwas getting razzed by the church community, she went ahead and pressed it.&quot;;  Natural hair designer Allen Biggers faults the mass media for pushing imagesof beauty that blacks try to match. When from cradle to grave they see fairhair, blue eyes and narrow features portrayed as beauty exemplified, blackscan scarcely keep from doubting the worth of their own attributes.;   &quot;Ourhair is usually referred to as excessively curly or unruly,&quot; observes Biggers,who shaves his head and won't touch a head of hair unless it's in the naturalstate. &quot;There's this attitude we have that says it must be changed by chemicalmeans. What we're doing is emulating European-Americans' hairstyles.&quot;;  Compliments from whites; A client, Marie Decuir, has hair that is dark brownand feathery. Since the 1960s, she has gone back and forth between natural andpermanent styles. She's so happy with the style Biggers designed for her, andso wary of more hair loss and breakage, that she plans to keep wearingnaturals.;   Her hairstyle gets positive reactions from people, but &quot;not forthe right reasons.&quot; Instead of commenting on the cut, they compliment thesoft, feathery texture. Unstated in those compliments is the incorrect notionthat most black hair is not soft and feathery to the touch.;  &quot;European-Americans in the workplace pay my customers all types of compliments-- the negative responses come from African-American women,&quot; Biggers says.&quot;The ones who don't wear their hair natural can't accept it. They feel like itreflects on them because of their own insecurity.&quot;;   Client StephaniePatterson says that was true of the reactions she got to her natural style oncampus at Western Michigan University.;   &quot;Everybody white wanted to touchit,&quot; she says. &quot;The blacks didn't know -- they called me bald-headed andwhatnot. Other girls went and got weaves put in their hair, but this fit meand my personality.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  SCOTT WALTON, Knight-Ridder News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Detroit  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911013  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6L  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  848  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, October 13, 199100287172,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
