Schering, a pharmaceutical and consumer products company, said it also agreed to pay European Home Products $7 million for &quot;certain services&quot; after the closing, scheduled for midsummer.    As Schering-Plough previously announced, it will retain the Dr. Scholl's businesses in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean. These businesses, a company spokesman said, focus on foot-care products, while the businesses to be sold are oriented toward footwear and retail shops. The spokesman said the latter are &quot;outside our area of expertise.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
