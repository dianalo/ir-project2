(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   At Taffy's luncheonette, as elsewherein the small towns of northeastern Massachusetts, there was an airof resignation Friday _ the look that hangs over a town that justlost in the semifinals against the team from the big city.   That prevailing wind resulted from a Nuclear RegulatoryCommission decision Thursday to allow low-power testing at thenearby Seabrook, N.H., nuclear power plant. It's an important firststep to a full-power license, and a defeat for those who for twodecades have fought the plant's opening.   Betty, a customer who would give her opinion but not her lastname, summed up: ``There's too much money involved in it, and moneytalks.''   ``We've known from almost Day 1 that at some point this wouldhappen,'' said Norma Beit, chairperson of Citizens Within the10-Mile Radius, an anti-Seabrook group. ``We've always known it(NRC) was a kangaroo court, and it has been.''   Still, many in this coastal region say they aren't ready tosurrender.   For one thing, Seabrook's opponents insist the federal courts,not the NRC, will have the final say in whether Seabrook ever putsout even a watt of electricity. The NRC put its decision on hold toallow for a possible court appeal. If that fails, low-power testingcould begin in a week.   The administration of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis and the citizensgroups opposed to Seabrook argue that it would be impossible toevacuate the region during a nuclear accident, particularly duringthe summer months when thousands jam the narrow roads leading tothe beaches.   ``The geography of the area and the availability oftransportation resources are key,'' said Tom Moughan of Amesbury.``Also, there are the dramatic wind shifts. A change in thedirection of a radiation plume can blow it as far as Haverhillwithin a matter of minutes.''   ``I don't know how they let them start building without a fullevacuation plan,'' said Bob Goldthwaite, manager of Atkinson'sLumber in Newburyport. ``It's difficult to get a safe evacuationplan. Look at Chernobyl _ we saw the cloud over here. ... How farcan you run?''   Arguments like that one are now being made before the NRC'sAtomic Safety and Licensing Board, which since March has beenholding hearings in Boston on the evacuation plan for Massachusettscommunities within 10 miles of the plant. The plan was developed byNew Hampshire Yankee, operator of the facility, after Massachusettsofficials refused.   Seabrook officials say the plant is safe and is badly needed tomeet New England's energy needs into the 21st century. They arguethat their evacuation plan, which includes alerting the plant'sMassachusetts neighbors by sirens mounted on trucks andhelicopters, is sufficient.   The evacuation plan must be approved before the plant islicensed to run at full power. But state officials say that if thepanel approves the plan, they will appeal to a higher court.   Ingrid Sanborn, a resident of West Newbury for 23 years, did notattend the first protests against Seabrook in the early days. Shesaid she chose instead to work through the system, attendingmeetings in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, and becomingincreasingly discouraged with what she saw.   She predicted residents would not give up.   ``The people in this area,'' Sanborn said, ``will go to whateverlength they have to.''</TEXT></DOC>
