For the purpose, it is necessary to establisha technology of testing and evaluating ceramics as a structural material.However, ceramics testing is very difficult in general because of theirbrittleness. Prior to practical use of ceramics as an ultra-high temperaturestructural material, ultra-high temperature tension-compression fatiguetesting technique which are the most difficult for ceramics has beendeveloped in cooperation with testing machine manufacturers as one oftesting and evaluating technologies to be the basis. And the rigidityof the whole testing machine was improved and an advanced specimen griptype was established. Fatigue tests were carried out at 1300{sup 0}Con a silicon carbide by using the testing machines developed. From thetest results, the techniques were found to have sufficient accuracy andreliability for the ceramics fatigue tests. (20 figs, 5 tabs, 9 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
