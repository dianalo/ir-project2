The move by the country's largest brokerage, which broadens apolicy in place since September 1987, was the latest move by a WallStreet firm to protest South Africa's apartheid policies.   ``The new policy is significantly more comprehensive thanrequired by federal law and meets the criteria of anti-apartheidinitiatives that have been adopted or are under consideration byvarious state and local governments in the United States,'' MerrillLynch spokesman Fred Yager said.   Under the sweeping new policy, Merill Lynch and its subsidiarieswill no longer engage in any financial or commercial transactionswith the South African government, any of its agencies or anycorporation or individuals organized or residing in the country.   The company will not conduct securities research on SouthAfrican companies or offer investment recommendations on theirstocks, effective immediately. Researchers will continue to respondto questions from the company's sales force on developments andtrends in South Africa until Jan. 31.   Also, Merrill Lynch will not buy or sell South African sharesfor customers. This extends to American depositary receipts forSouth African stocks plus options, warrants and other instruments.An ADR is a vehicle for U.S. investors to trade in foreignsecurities.   Researchers at Merrill Lynch will continue to keep track of theSouth African gold and precious metals industry as part of a globaloverview. But the company said it won't offer opinions onindividual South African mining companies.   ``Because of the importance of South Africa in terms of globalgold production, it is necessary to be aware of production trendsin that market in order to be able to fully assess the outlook forgold,'' Yager said.   The revised policy was outlined in an internal corporatememorandum to employees. The company has periodically reviewed itspolicy since implementing restrictions on its dealings with SouthAfrica in 1987.   Other investment firms, such as Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.,already refuse to do business with South Africa. Numerous otherfirms have curtailed their South African connections to comply withlegal requirements.   The news of Merrill Lynch's toughened policy came on a day whenthe South African government announced the repeal of a majorsegregation law, called the Separate Amenities Act.   President F.W. de Klerk said the government will open allwhites-only beaches to blacks and repeal the law allowing localauthorities to segregate public facilities.   Accounts maintained for customers residing in South Africa willbe closed as of Jan. 31.   Previously, Merrill Lynch had various prohibitions on SouthAfrican dealings, some implemented to comply with laws.   The company had not conducted business in the country, owned orrun any operations there or bough or sold South African gold coinsor other commodities. Also, Merrill Lynch did not engage in anytransaction that would have involved paying taxes or duties to theSouth African government, the company said.</TEXT></DOC>
