As part of the decision, the appeals-court panel alsogutted a Securities Exchange Act regulation that is widelyused in insider-trading cases. That regulation, known as Rule14e-3, makes it a crime to trade on misappropriatedinformation involving a tender offer -- even if the defendantisn't violating a fiduciary duty by making the trade. TheSecurities and Exchange Commission commonly relies on Rule14e-3 in insider-trading cases against defendants who aren'tcompany insiders.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This decision seems to seriously emasculate Rule 14e-3,&quot;said Harvey Pitt, a defense attorney in Washington, and aformer SEC general counsel. He said Rule 14e-3 has been &quot;theprincipal weapon, since its adoption in 1980, ininsider-trading cases involving takeovers.&quot;   The rule has been used in a wide range of SEC lawsuits,including the original case against Michael Milken. The SECalso has alleged 14e-3 violations in its suits against AndrewSolomon, a former research analyst with the broker-dealerfirm Marcus Schloss and Co.; Ronald Yagoda, formerly a seniorofficial at Marcus Schloss; and Giuseppe Tome, an investmentbanker accused of insider trading in St. Joe Minerals Corp.stock. Mr. Solomon and Mr. Yagoda settled with the SEC, and afederal judge ordered Mr. Tome to pay back hisinsider-trading profits.   The three-judge panel of the U.S. Second Circuit Court ofAppeals unanimously reversed Mr. Chestman's conviction, andordered his release from prison. But it was divided 2-1 inrejecting Rule 14e-3.   Richard Kirby, senior litigation counsel for the SEC, saidthat if the decision stands, the SEC will be prohibited frommaking 14e-3 charges in the Second Circuit, which includesNew York. Assistant U.S. Attorney Scott Gilbert said thegovernment is reviewing its options for appealing the case.   Mr. Chestman, formerly a broker with Gruntal andamp; Co., wasfound guilty in March 1989 of 31 counts related to allegedinsider trading in Waldbaum Inc. stock. But the trading wasbased on information that Mr. Chestman received fourth-hand,making him what is known as a &quot;remote tippee.&quot; The courtreversed the conviction on the ground that Mr. Chestmanhadn't been told that the information was confidential.   The case, which was seen as an attempt to expand the scopeof who can can be prosecuted for insider trading, involvedMr. Chestman's trading in Waldbaum stock in 1986 before thecompany's takeover by Great Atlantic andamp; Pacific Tea Co. Mr.Chestman claimed that the information that prompted him tobuy the stock wasn't inside information because it came froma distant relative of Waldbaum's then-president.   Mr. Chestman wasn't told that the information wasconfidential, and no assurances were made that theinformation would be kept secret as it was passed along onits way to Mr. Chestman, the appeals court said.   &quot;There can be no misappropriation of information by onewho is unaware of the confidentiality of that information,&quot;the appeals court said in its decision. &quot;After passingthrough several family channels, it cannot be said that theinformation was confidential to any degree or was any morethan `family gossip.'&quot;   Mr. Chestman was expected to be released last night fromthe Allenwood Federal Prison Camp in Pennsylvania. Hevoluntarily began serving his two-year sentence last Junewhile his appeal was pending.   Elkan Abramowitz, Mr. Chestman's attorney, said theappeals court's decision &quot;should put restraints on thegovernment. . . . I think they will have to think twice nowwhen they bring a misappropriation case {for alleged insidertrading} when there is no breach of fiduciary duty.&quot;   John C. Coffee, a professor at Columbia Law School, saidthe decision's &quot;significance is to limit the expansion of themisappropriation theory. Under this decision, it can only beapplied when the government can make a showing that thedefendant knew the information was stolen.&quot;   Theodore Levine, an attorney in Washington, said theappeals court decision illustrates &quot;the clear need for thegovernment to define what insider trading is.&quot;   Mr. Pitt, who represented stock speculator Ivan F. Boeskyin his insider trading-related plea bargain in 1986, helpeddraft proposed legislation on insider trading in 1987. Hesaid the court decision could spur the renewal of suchcongressional efforts. &quot;It's much better for people to knowwhat the rules are in advance of the activity,&quot; he said.   Mr. Pitt added that under the 1987 proposal, which was notadopted by Congress, Mr. Chestman's conduct would have beenprohibited.   The SEC believes Rule 14e-3 is well within thecommission's rule-making authority, said Mr. Kirby, the SEC'ssenior litigation counsel. He said the rule was adopted to dojust what the divided court decision has declared invalid --to go after alleged insider traders who don't have afiduciary duty not to use the information.   &quot;The commission had the power under the statutes toprovide a rule that didn't require proof of a breach offiduciary duty&quot; in insider-trading cases, he said.   Mr. Kirby said the commission will immediately beginreviewing the appeals court decision. He said that, inaddition to considering an appeal, the commission could turnto Congress and ask that the SEC regulation be adopted aslaw.   Mr. Abramowitz said he is reviewing Mr. Chestman'ssettlement of SEC civil charges in the case to see whetherthe agreement can be revised in light of the appeals courtdecision. In that settlement, reached in January, Mr.Chestman was barred from the securities industry and agreedto pay $235,125 in profits allegedly made through insidertrading. Mr. Chestman consented to the settlement withoutadmitting or denying guilt.</TEXT></DOC>
