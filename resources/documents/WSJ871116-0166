The parties agreed to meet today to resume bargaining and to impose a news blackout while the negotiations proceed, said Patrick Hart, a commissioner of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.    Some 1,400 clerical and operations staff members struck the Big Board last Tuesday. The strike by Local 153 of the Office and Professional Employees International Union also affected Securities Industry Automation Corp., which is two-thirds owned by the Big Board and operates the exchange's computer system.    Members of the union and management indicated that operations had proceeded in close-to-normal fashion despite the strike. According to the exchange, union members had been crossing picket lines to work in increasing numbers until the strike was ended Friday.    The Big Board said that about 20% of the union members worked on Tuesday, about 24% Wednesday and about 31% Thursday. Citing the news blackout, union officials didn't confirm or deny those figures.    Relatively light trading volume in recent days also helped blunt the strike's impact. &quot;The timing was bad,&quot; said one exchange clerk who continued to work during the strike.    Neither Mr. Hart nor officials of the contending parties would say whether any progress has been made in negotiations so far.    The Big Board's last pre-strike offer called for a 5% wage increase in each of three years. Pension benefits were the chief bone of contention in the negotiations, both sides have said. The exchange offered full pension benefits at age 62; the union wanted them to start at age 55. The amount of the benefits also is in dispute. </TEXT></DOC>
