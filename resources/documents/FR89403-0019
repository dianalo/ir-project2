ITC Recommendations </ITAG>The Interagency Testing Committee (ITC) designated TGME, TGEE, and TGBEfor priority testing consideration in its Sixteenth Report published inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4> of May 21, 1985 (50 FR 20930), and recommendedpharmacokinetic and metabolic studies. The results of those studies woulddetermine whether subchronic studies with emphasis on hematologic effects,as well as reproductive and developmental toxicity tests, should be performed.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Proposed Test Rule </ITAG>EPA issued a proposed test rule, published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of May 15, 1986 (51 FR 17883), requiring thatmanufacturers and processors of the three triethylene glycol ethers conducttoxicologic testing on the glycol ethers they manufacture or process. Thistesting was based on EPA findings of the potential for unreasonable riskunder TSCA section 4(a)(1)(A) and a finding of substantial production andexposure under TSCA section 4(a)(1)(B). These findings are more fully describedin the proposed rule. A two-stage test rule was proposed. Subchronic toxicity,developmental toxicity, neurotoxicity, developmental neurotoxicity, andlower-tier mutagenicity comprised the first stage. Following review ofdata from these tests EPA would decide if the second-stage tests, oncogenicity,upper-tier mutagenicity, and reproductive toxicity, were needed.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Testing Consent Order Negotiation </ITAG>Following the test rule proposal, the Chemical Manufacturers Association(CMA) informed EPA that members of CMA's Glycol Ether Panel were sponsoringa series of tests on TGME. They planned to conduct a 90-day dermal toxicitytest and a dermal developmental toxicity study in the rabbit, an <T3>in vivo </T3>mouse micronucleus test, and an Ames assay. They had alreadyinitiated an oral Chernoff-Kavlock developmental toxicity screen in therat and a 21-day dermal range-finding study in the rabbit, with the highdose at 1 gram/kilogram (g/kg) as a limit test, and an <T3>in vitro </T3>dermal absorption study using human skin. These testswere done on all three glycol ethers, with no obvious toxicity differencesbetween the chemical substances. By February 1987, EPA informed CMA that EPA was considering the optionof a Testing Consent Order. On May 19, 1987, EPA issued a notice (52 FR18738) to this effect, requesting public participation and announcing ameeting on May 28, 1987, to initiate testing negotiations. After several scientific meetings, CMA's Glycol Ethers Panel submittedto EPA a draft Consent Order on September 30, 1987, which included allbut one of the first-stage tests proposed by EPA for TGME, TGEE and TGBE,with TGME as the test substance representing all three. The only testingnot agreed upon was for developmental neurotoxicity. After a period ofintensive discussion on developmental neurotoxicity testing, a final ConsentOrder, excluding developmental neurotoxicity, was signed by March 8, 1989by Cain Chemical Inc., The Dow Chemical Company, Eastman Kodak Company,Shell Chemical Company, and Union Carbide Corporation. In this ConsentOrder, the manufacturers agreed to perform certain toxicologic tests onTGME by specific dates according to the test standards in the Appendixof the Order. The final test rule for developmental neurotoxicity testingof TGME is published elsewhere in this <T4>Federal Register</T4>. EPA is deferring final decisions on furthertesting of TGEE and TGBE (51 FR 17883) until the results of the ConsentOrder testing are available (see Unit V). <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Use and Exposure </ITAG>These glycol ethers are primarily co-produced during the manufacture oflower molecular weight glycol ethers. About 5 percent of production ispurified further for use as chemical intermediates, but the majority issold in a technical grade for use as a diluent in brake fluid. Preliminary data from the National Occupational Exposure Survey (NOES),conducted by the National lnstitute for Occupational Safety and Health(NIOSH) from 1980 to 1983, indicate that approximately 250,000 workers,including 8,000 females, were potentially exposed to brake fluids in theworkplace in 1980 (Ref. 1). Although there are no data on actual levelsof dermal exposure in the workplace, the nature of brake system maintenanceand repair suggests that complete exposure of both hands occurs regularly,even daily, for many professional mechanics. EPA has recently preparedan updated exposure profile of mechanics (at least 175,000 estimated) exposedto brake fluids with at least one contact per day, resulting in estimatedexposures ranging from 520 to 2,300 milligrams (mg)/day for 250 days peryear (Ref. 2). Furthermore, there is a potential for consumer exposure,since some individuals can be expected to perform brake maintenance, includingaddition of brake fluid, on their automobiles. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Testing Program </ITAG>The proposed test rule would have required that most of the tests be performeddermally, since that is the route of human exposure, and the manufacturersagree that this would be most useful for risk assessment. This ConsentOrder however, requires that the route of administration for the developmentaltoxicity and subchronic neurotoxicity tests be oral to assure that a sufficientdose will be administered for hazard identification. As TGME has relatively low acute toxicity by the oral or dermal route,the previously completed study by CMA prior to the issuance of the Orderused the 1 g/kg limit test for the initial range-finding. This study foundessentially no effect in the 21-day test in the rabbit. Because EPA founda possible maximum human dermal exposure of 3,900 mg/day (Ref. 3), or 56mg/kg/day for a 70 kg person, the high dose of the test should be greaterthan the 1 g/kg limit test dose. Dow scientists were able to apply 4 g/kgpercutaneously to the Sprague-Dawley rat (Ref. 3) in a second range-findingstudy. However, in order to approach a 100-fold margin of exposure forTGME, the high dose should be at least 5 g/kg for neurotoxicity tests,which would require oral dosing. Despite the requirement to conduct someof these tests via the oral route, the manufacturers subject to the Orderhave informed EPA that they plan to do both oral subchronic neurotoxicityand dermal subchronic regular toxicity studies in the Sprague-Dawley rat,since they believe the dermal route to be more informative.In the Consent Order, the five manufacturers agree to conduct the followingstudies in accordance with the cited test guidelines. A dermal subchronicstudy will be conducted in the Sprague-Dawley rat according to 40 CFR 798.2250,using at least 4 g/kg as the high dose. Three combined oral subchronicneurotoxicity tests will be conducted in the Sprague-Dawley rat, usingat least 5 g/kg as a high dose, according to 40 CFR 798.6050, 798.6200,and 798.6400. Developmental toxicity studies in the Sprague-Dawley ratand the rabbit will be conducted by the oral gavage route of exposure usingat least 5 g/kg as a high dose, according to 40 CFR 798.4900. The highdoses listed above will be required unless range-finding studies indicatethat lower doses will produce adequate toxicity for an evaluation. The remaining studies to be performed are three mutagenicity tests: the<T3>Salmonella typhimurium</T3> reverse mutation assay, 40 CFR 798.5265;detection of gene mutation in somatic cells in culture, 40 CFR 798.5300;and a mouse <T3>in vivo</T3> micronucleus assay, 40 CFR 798.5395. If any of these indicatea hazard for genetic toxicity, EPA will consider the need for further testing.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s25,r25,10  </C><T4>Testing Plan for TGME  </T4><H1>Test </H1><H1>Test standards </H1><H1>Report \1\ date </H1> Mutagenicity: <ITAG tagnum="2"><T3>Salmonella typhimurium</T3> <D>40 CFR 798.5265 </D><D>12 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Somatic cells in culture <D>40 CFR 798.5300 </D><D>12 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Mouse micronucleus <D>40 CFR 798.5395 </D><D>12 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Developmental toxicity <D>40 CFR 798.4900 </D><D>12 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Subchronic toxicity <D>40 CFR 798.2250 </D><D>18 </D></ITAG>Subchronic neurotoxicity: <ITAG tagnum="2">Neurobehavioral battery <D>40 CFR 798.6050 </D><D>18 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Motor activity <D>40 CFR 798.6200 </D><D>18 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Neuropathology <D>40 CFR 798.6400 </D><D>18 </D><F>\1\ Months after effective date of Consent Order.</F></ITAG></ITAG>  The above Table delineates the tests, test standards, and final reportingdates for all the tests incorporated in the Testing Consent Order. Thetest standards with modifications are attached to the Order. EPA will usethe data generated by these tests to determine the potential risk to humanhealth from exposure to TGME and to determine whether any additional testingof TGME, TGEE, or TGBE is necessary. EPA believes that testing may not be necessary for all three glycol ethers.In the lower congeners (the monoethylene glycol ethers) the methyl compoundis the most toxic of the three in developmental (Ref. 5), reproductive(Refs. 6, 7, and 8), and neurotoxic effects (Refs. 9 and 10). Therefore,EPA will wait until the TGME testing is completed before determining whethertesting on the other two is necessary. Although EPA does not intend towithdraw at this time its May 15, 1986 (51 FR 17883) proposal for testingtriethylene glycol ethers, EPA will not issue any final test rules on thetypes of tests covered in this Testing Consent Order for any of the threetriethylene glycol ethers in the proposed test rule during the period inwhich testing on TGME is conducted pursuant to the Consent Order to EPA'ssatisfaction. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Export Notification </ITAG>The issuance of the Consent Order subjects any person who exports or intendsto export TGME, TGEE, or TGBE to the export notification requirements ofsection 12(b) of TSCA. The specific requirements are listed in 40 CFR Part707. On June 23, 1987, EPA established 40 CFR 799.5000 as a listing ofConsent Orders issued by EPA (52 FR 23548). This listing serves as notificationto persons who export or who intend to export chemical substances or mixtureswhich are the subject of Testing Consent Orders that 40 CFR Part 707 applies.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII.
