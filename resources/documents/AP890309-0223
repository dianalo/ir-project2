Mead Data Central Inc. of Dayton electronically stores generalnews, business, legal, medical and other information. The data isfed daily from newspapers, magazines, wire services, book publishersand other sources.   The information is collected through satellite transmissions,telephone lines and even _ in the case of court documents _transcribed from copies, then placed in Mead's electronic library ina format that can be quickly located and retrieved.   ``Everything that's happening today will be in our system _ ormost of it _ by tomorrow,'' said Jack Simpson, president of MeadData Central.   The company has about 200,000 active users in 50 countries. Itscomputer library is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and runsbetween 50,000 and 75,000 active information searches every day.   About 500 million characters of information are added to thelibrary weekly. The company employs about 3,000 workers, 1,500 ofthem in Dayton. The workers manage the information coming into thesystem and keep the computers operating.   A customer seeking information calls Mead through a computerhookup. The information is instantly researched and relayed back viacomputer, with the customer billed for the amount of computer timeused.   During the peak afternoon hours, the Mead computers can behandling as many as 900 calls simultaneously.   Discs and computers are kept in a bunkered building on 1.5 acres.The building is fireproof and earthquake-proof, and has five hugediesel generators _ ``enough to run a small city'' _ in case powerfails.   ``It's a very sophisticated never-die kind of a computingfacility,'' Simpson said. ``The customers are not very sympatheticif they need information and it's not there.''   Mead Data Central is a unit of Mead Corp., the Dayton-based papermaker. The subsidiary was formed about 15 years ago with thecreation of Lexus, the electronic information system designed forlaw firms and corporations.   Lexus is the focus of a trademark feud with Japan's Toyota MotorCorp., which has introduced a new luxury car called Lexis. Mead DataCentral said the Lexis name infringed on its Lexus name.   On Wednesday, a federal appeals court panel in New York turnedaside Mead Data Central's attempt to bar Toyota from using the Lexusname. It was unclear whether Mead would appeal.   The company turned in a record year in 1988, pulling in more than$300 million in revenue. Simpson has said he believes the computerinformation industry is still in the process of forming.   ``Proving that you could put all of this in a computer andmanaging all those words took a lot of doing,'' he said. ``Making iteconomical for law firms and corporations to use has been a bigchallenge.''   Simpson said the company is also moving into information storagefor the Securities and Exchange Commission, which generates massiveamounts of data. The company is part of a consortium that recentlywon a $52 million contract to computerize the SEC.   Simpson said the amount of data held by the SEC is equivalent toall of the information Mead has put into its computer over the past15 years. It would be the first federal agency to place its data inan electronic library in this form.</TEXT></DOC>
