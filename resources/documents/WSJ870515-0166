With a shriek, a hair-thin stream of water moving at three times the speed of sound pierces the metal and briskly carves its way around the outline.    The worker is using a little-known device called an ultra-high-pressure water jet. A growing number of manufacturers are using the technology, long viewed as little more than a laboratory curiosity, to cut everything from frozen pizzas and disposable diapers to thick slabs of carbon steel. Users say water jets can reduce costs, improve productivity and make the workplace environment safer. And researchers think the device may someday revolutionize the mining industry.    &quot;In actual cutting time, it's much faster&quot; than the carbide or diamond-dusted tools LTV Corp.'s Aircraft Product Group had used to cut aerospace parts from high-tech composites, says engineer George A. Earle III. After some hesitation about the concept, he says, the unit bought a water-jet cutter in 1985 and has since acquired another. While the device won't replace stamping techniques for mass-produced items, he says, &quot;the things it does, it does very well.&quot;    SCIENTISTS HAVE KNOWN for decades that water, when placed under great pressure and focused through a tiny aperture, can cut through any number of materials. The first tentative commercial applications of water-jet cutting took place in the 1970s, but technical difficulties hindered widespread use. The enormous stresses from sustaining pressures up to 55,000 pounds per square inch rapidly fatigued materials used in pumps, hoses and gaskets, causing frequent breakdowns early on.    Refinements in materials and technology have substantially improved reliability and lowered costs in recent years, however. The most significant advance came a few years ago when water-jet manufacturers learned how to introduce particles of fine abrasive sand into the high-speed flow, enhancing the jet's erosive power.    Over the past couple of years water jets have become the tool of choice for trimming such hard-to-cut materials as bulletproof glass, ceramics and titanium. For many specialized cutting jobs, the device offers a number of advantages over mechanical methods. The jet is considerably faster and leaves a smoother cut, and it cuts cold, so materials along the edge don't warp or melt. The water stream bears powdered material away from the cut, eliminating the need for elaborate dust venting systems. And because there's no contact with the surface, there's no costly replacement of worn-out cutting tools. In addition, water jets produce little recoil or vibration, so they're suited for use with lightweight industrial robots.    BUT UNTIL RECENTLY, acceptance of the system was slow, providing a case study in the difficulties in transferring novel technology to the workplace. &quot;Disbelief is the first reaction&quot; when prospective customers hear about cutting with water, says Henry C. Massenburg, president and chief executive of Flow Systems Inc. Although the Kent, Wash., water-jet manufacturer has sold hundreds of systems to clients who cut products such as candy bars, circuit boards, and shoe soles, he concedes &quot;there's still a tremendous amount of missionary selling to be done.&quot; Flow Systems' only major competitor in the production water-jet market is a subsidiary of Ingersoll-Rand Co.    An official at Design Systems Inc., a Tukwila, Wash., food-processing equipment designer which incorporates water jets in equipment used for cutting foodstuffs like fish fillets and frozen lasagna, says the food industry's interest in the technology is &quot;very high&quot; and has been building for about two years.    ULTRAHIGH-PRESSURE WATER is also beginning to be put to use by construction companies and shipyards on jobs once done by sandblasters, acetylene torches and mechanical concrete cutters. &quot;Every day there are new applications,&quot; says Tom Wilgus, of Power Master Inc., a Portland, Ore., industrial-services concern. He notes that water jets are especially useful in places where a flame might set off an explosion.    Admac Inc. recently introduced a device that uses water to strip off the top three inches of a bridge's concrete roadway for repaving. &quot;One machine replaces 17 jackhammers,&quot; says an official of the Flow Systems affiliate. &quot;We can run 24 hours a day in the city,&quot; he adds. &quot;A jackhammer would drive people nuts.&quot;    The water jet's low-thrust cutting power and dust-reducing effect make it a natural for use in the mining industry. Researchers are pushing to develop a system that would allow miners to selectively cut out mineral veins without having to haul out the unwanted surrounding rock produced by current blasting or mechanical methods. While prototypes have been developed, &quot;we're 10 years away&quot; from full-scale operations, says Michael Hood, a professor of mining at the University of California-Berkeley. Development of water-jet-assisted bits for deep drilling is further along, he says.    The Energy Department recently awarded the High-Pressure Waterjet Laboratory at the University of Missouri-Rolla a contract to build a water-jet device for a widely used mining technique known as room-and-pillar mining, according to lab head David Summers. &quot;I've spent 21 years of my life at this,&quot; says Prof. Summers, who is also president of the water-jet industry's trade association. &quot;For a long time it was just 'crazy Dave down the hall.' Now we get inquiries every week.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
