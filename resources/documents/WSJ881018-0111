ATandamp;T said the reduction, which will cut prices $697 million annually, will go into effect Dec. 1, assuming no objection by the FCC. The industry expected the move because it reflects FCC-ordered reductions in payments ATandamp;T makes to connect to local telephone companies.    Whether consumers and small businesses will see a net decrease in their total telephone bills will depend on how much long-distance service they use. Local bills for residences and small businesses will show an FCC-ordered 60-cents-a-month increase in charges by local companies beginning in December. The so-called subscriber line charge, currently $2.60 a month, reflects part of the cost of connecting long-distance companies with local companies.    Analysts said consumers whose long-distance bills exceed $15 a month would see a net decrease in their telephone bills; those with long-distance charges under $15 monthly would see a net increase in their total bill. Residences average $15 a month in long-distance charges, according to Jack Grubman of PaineWebber Inc.    The subscriber line charge is scheduled to increase 30 cents in April for residences and small businesses. ATandamp;T said it probably will announce a further price cut in February to reflect that change.    Competitors generally match ATandamp;T's price cuts to keep their rates lower than the telephone giant, which still has a 70% to 80% market share, according to some analysts. US Sprint Communications Co., a joint venture of GTE Corp. and United Telecommunications Inc., said it will have to study ATandamp;T's filing before deciding how to adjust its rates. &quot;Historically, we've had a competitive response to ATandamp;T,&quot; a US Sprint spokesman said.    Yesterday, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, ATT common closed at $26.75 a share, up 12.5 cents, on volume of almost 1.4 million shares.    Analysts noted that unlike past rate cuts, this proposal doesn't necessarily favor businesses over consumers because ATandamp;T isn't changing the amount it discounts calls that are made during the evening and at night. The company did propose restructuring its rates for WATS, or Wide Area Telecommunications Service, to meet the more flexible pricing plans of MCI Communications Corp. and US Sprint.    A spokeswoman for MCI Communications said the company is reviewing ATandamp;T's filing, and plans to maintain its competitive position. Historically, MCI has matched ATandamp;T rate cuts.    WATS prices will be cut 4% beginning Jan. 1, ATandamp;T said. In addition, instead of paying a flat hourly charge for calls to a section of the country, customers will pay according to the distance and duration of their calls. The charges still will be 20% less than regular long-distance rates. In addition, customers will get reductions of 10% or 15% off their total bill, depending on the total charges for calling during business hours, ATandamp;T said.    Mr. Grubman said the WATS restructuring is yet another move by ATandamp;T to blunt inroads by MCI and US Sprint into the market for calling by businesses smaller than the Fortune 200. In recent months, ATandamp;T has switched staff employees to sales jobs and proposed a number of new pricing plans in response to competitors. </TEXT></DOC>
