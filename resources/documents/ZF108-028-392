(Qandamp;A)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Gasteiger, Daniel.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>ANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT LOTUS PRODUCTSandM;1-2-3/SYMPHONYandM;WHERE ARE MY FOOTERS?andM;Q.andP;  I can't print footers.andP;  I use the Print Printer Options Footer command toestablish a footer.andP;  Then I print a file.andP;  The header and text appear in theprintout, but the footer does not.andM;I'm using 1-2-3 Release 2.01, an HP Vectra computer, and an HP LaserJet II.andO;Any clues?andM;Mary Godwin Furman University Greenville, S.C.andM;A.andP;  Our guess is that your documents result in only one page of output, andthat you aren't finishing the print sequence by selecting Page from the Printmenu.andP;  If you want 1-2-3 to print a footer on the last page of a printout,you must select Page (in Symphony, Page-Advance) after you select Go andbefore you select Quit.andP;  Symphony users can use the SERVICES Print SettingsPage Footer command to establish a page footer.andM;CHANGING FONTSandM;SEEMS TO ADD SPACESandM;Q.andP;  I did some experimentation after I read &quot;Setup Strings Can ControlPrinting&quot; in the March 1989 issue.andP;  I used an Epson LQ-850 printer to printrange A1..C8 of the following worksheet:andM;The printer produced type of three different styles, as follows:andM;As you can see, either the software or the printer inserted extra spacesahead of the lettering, even though each line of text begins at the very leftof column A.andP;  This isn't what I had in mind.andP;  Any suggestions?andM;Donald F. Elsmore Burbank, Calif.andM;A.andP;  Neither the software nor the hardware is at fault.andP;  Both printed exactlyas they should if you left margin is set at 10 characters.andP;  In 1-2-3 youadjust the margin by selecting /Print Printer Options Margins Left.andM;In Symphony you select SERVICES Print Settings Margins Left to set printmargins that govern printing from both a SHEET and a DOC window.andP;  However,you can also set margins in a DOC window by selecting MENU Format SettingsLeft.andP;  Symphony adds DOC-window margin settings to the underlying printmargin settings.andP;  So if you print margin setting is 4 and your DOC windowmargin is 6, the total effective margin is 10.andM;In any case, when the printer expands the size of the characters, it alsoexpands the size of a character space.andP;  So a margin of 10 character in onetype style is wider than a margin of 10 in another type style.andP;  If you wisheach line of output to begin flush with the left margin of the printout,adjust your print settings to a left margin of zero.andM;MULTIPLE CONDITIONSandM;Q.andP;  How can I make an @IF function dependent on more than one condition?andP;  Forexample, I'd like the condition to be [is less than]5 or [is greater than]10.andO;I can get it to work by using two formulas.andP;  One formula eliminatesexceptions to the first condition; the second eliminates exceptions to thesecond condition.andP;  However, this is awkward.andM;Rob Thomson Patons andamp; Baldwins Canada Inc. Toronto, Ont.andM;A.andP;  From the wording of your question, it's not entirely clear whatconditions you want to set.andP;  We'll look at both of the possibilities you'vesuggested.andM;Suppose that the value in question resides in cell B2.andP;  If you want acondition to return 1, or true, when the value in cell B2 falls between 5 and10, you must write a mathematical expression that means &quot;B2 is greater than 5and B2 is less than 10.&quot;andP;  In 1-2-3 and Symphony, the mathematical expressionis +B2[is greater than]5 #AND#B2[is less than]10.andM;But what if you want the statement to be true for values outside the rangefrom 5 to 10?andP;  You an express this condition verbally by sayin that cell B2is less than 5 or cell B2 is grater than 10.andP;  The formulaic equivalent tothis expression is +B2[is less than]5#OR#B2[is greater than]10.andM;PAGE NUMBERS ARE WRONGandM;Q.andP;  I use several macros like the one shown below to print a series of rangesfrom within a single worksheet.andP;  Unfortunately, the header numbers the pagesstarting at one at the beginning of each range.andM;I'd like the page numbering to be sequential from the first page that printsthrough the last page, regardless of how many ranges are involved.andP;  Is theresome way to accomplish this?andM;David J. Harries Tru Circle Corp. Wichita, Kans.andM;A.andP;  We've added a Symphony macro, starting in cell B4 of the illustration,because your question applies to that product as well.andP;  The macro selectsAlign from the Print menu after assigning each Print range.andP;  Selecting Alignresets page numbering.andP;  If you want a macro to print several ranges usingonly succesive page numbers, don't put the Align command in your macro code,except after the first data range.andM;DO ENTRIES REVEAL A BUG?andM;Q.andP;  I think I've found a bug in Symphony.andP;  Sometimes I can edit a label entryand build it into a formula, and other times I can't.andP;  For example, theworksheet below contains the characters &quot;Mares eat oats &quot;andamp;A3 in cell A1, andand does eat oats in cell A3.andM;Here's the procedure I used to create the formula: Move the cell pointer tocell A1 and press EDIT Home.andP;  Then type a plus sign and press Return.andP;  Thecursor jumps to the A of the cell address A3 and Symphony beeps as though theexpression is missing a parenthesis or something.andP;  Still, the formula looksidentical to successful formulas I've written.andM;Rex Clingan Maryland Heights, Mo.andM;A.andP;  The diskette you enclosed revealed the source of your problem.andP;  It's amistake that many users of Symphony and 1-2-3 make at least once in a while.andM;The entry in cell A1 of your worksheet appears to read &quot;Mares eat oats&quot; andamp;A3.andO;There should not be a character space following the 3 in the label.andP;  If youwatch when you press the EDIT key, you'll see that the cursor on the dit lineis an entire character width away from the 3.andP;  This is your problem.andP;  Simplypress the Backspace key to remove the errant character, and your editingprocedure will become valid.andP;  Whenever the spreadsheet won't accept aproper-looking cell entry or returns ERR in 1-2-3 Release 3, check forextraneous spaces.andP;  These are the easiest types to overlook.andM;SUM CATEGORIESandM;Q.andP;  In several of my spreadsheets, I need to add specific numbers in acolumn.andP;  For example, when posting entries by account code in a monthlyledger, I'd like to add just those records for a specific account.andP;  Ienvision a formula that sums those numbers in a range whose correspondingentries two columns to the right meet a criterion.andP;  Is there any easy way todo this?andM;Francois R. Bigot John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. Statesboro, Ga.andM;A.andP;  You've just described the @DSUM function.andP;  The @DSUM function sums allthe values within a column that fall in a category defined by a Criterionrange.andP;  For example, consider the following worksheet:andM;You'd like to sum the values in column C for every row that contains thelabel TX in column A.andP;  First, enter the labels and values shown in rangeA1..C6.andP;  Use the @DATE function to enter the dates in column B and formatthem as Date 2.andP;  Next, establish a Criterion range by copying the label fromcell A1 to cell E3.andP;  Then enter the label TX in cell E4.andM;Now enter the following formula in cell E1:andM;@DSUM(A1..C6,2,E3..E4)andM;The formula returns 5600.andP;  You can tally the values associated with the codeDIS by replacing the label in cell E4 with the label DIS.andM;The @DSUM function has three arguments.andP;  The first argument refers to aDatabase range--including the field names at the top of each column.andP;  Thesecond argument identifies which column in the database contains the valuesto tally.andP;  In this case, the second argument is 2.andP;  It means &quot;select thecolumn that is two columns to the right of the first column in the range.&quot;andM;The @DSUM function's third argument identifies a Criterion range.andP;  TheCriterion range must contain a field name that matches a field name in thedatabase.andP;  This field name identifies the column that contains the categoryyou want to sum.andP;  Enter the label, value, or formula that identifies yourcriterion in the Criterion range.andM;1-2-3andM;FIND SPECIFIC ENTRIESandM;Q.andP;  My busiest 1-2-3 file contains information in categories, such asaddresses, opening dates, and project locations.andP;  Our projects havealphanumeric project codes, such as F08651-89-B-005.andP;  I constantly add andremove information from the file, and I need to locate project numbersquickly.andM;This is a substantial list to cruise through to find one piece ofinformation.andP;  Is it possible to find project codes without knowing where theyreside?andM;Martha Smith All-Climate Guardian Window Co. Gordon, Wis.andM;A.andP;  The answer to your question depends upon the layout of the data in yourworksheet.andP;  If you've entered the information in a 1-2-3 database format, youcan find it quite quickly no matter which release of 1-2-3 you're using.andP;  Ifthe information isn't in a database format, your best bet is the Range Searchcommand in Release 2.2 or Release 3.andM;A 1-2-3 database contains information delineated by fields and records.andP;  Arecord typically contains whatever information you want to record about aparticular item.andP;  In your database this would most likely be all theinformation about a single project.andP;  That information must fall within asingle row of the worksheet.andP;  Each category of information--date, address,and project code, for example--is a field and falls within its own column.andO;The illustration on the previous page shows one possible arrangement of asmall database with these three fields.andM;To find information in a database, you must create a Criterion range, enter acriterion, and issue a Data Query command.andP;  To create a Criterion range, copythe database field names to an area above or to one side of the database.andP;  Tofollow our example, enter the labels and dates shown in the figure.andP;  Datesare formatted for Date 2.andP;  Copy the field names in range A3..C3 to rangeA1..C1.andM;Now select /Data Query Input and indicate the entire database (range A3..C8in this example) as the Input range.andP;  Select Criterion and indicate thecopied field names and a second row of cells (range A1..C2) as the Criterionrange.andP;  Then select Find.andP;  1-2-3 highlights the first row of the database.andM;Press the UpArrow or the DownArrow keys to browse through the records, thenpress Return to end the Data Query Find operation.andP;  Select Quit from the DataQuery menu.andM;The Data Query Find command should have &quot;found&quot; every record, because you hadnot assigned a criterion for the command to match.andP;  But suppose that you wantto find a known project code in the database.andP;  Enter the project code in thesecond row of the Criterion range, directly beneath the appropriate fieldname.andP;  In this case, enter the project code LF-88 into cell B2.andM;Now, to find the matching record, simply press the QUERY key (F7 on mostcomputers).andP;  You needn't repeat the menu sequence because you've alreadyperformed one Data Query Find operation.andP;  The QUERY key repeats whateverdatabase operation you last performed via the menus.andP;  1-2-3 highlights therecord for the project whose code is LF-88.andP;  In this example, the record isin row 6.andM;Complete the query operation by pressing Return.andP;  To find a different projectcode, enter the new code in cell B2 and press the QUERY key once more.andM;SUBTOTALING LIKE RECORDSandM;Q.andP;  Take a look at the database in the following illustration.andP;  Is there aneasy way to add up subtotals of the values in column C for each of thecustomer names in column B?andP;  I'd like the subtotals to appear in column Dadjacent to the last entry for each customer.andM;Richard Kluchar Chagrin Falls, OhioandM;A.andP;  Use the following pair of formulas.andP;  In cell D2 of your database, enterthe formula @IF(B3andless;andgt;B2,C2,&quot;&quot;).andP;  In cell D3 enter the following formula:andM;@IF(B3andless;andgt;B4,@SUM($C$2..C3)- @SUM($D$2..D2),&quot;&quot;)andM;Copy the formula from cell D3 down column D as needed.andP;  This technique won'twork in 1-2-3 Release 2 or in Symphony.andM;For these formulas to work, there must be a character entered below the lastrecord.andP;  In this example, enter a backslash and a hyphen (\-) in cell A9 andcopy it to range B9..D9.andM;TRANSLATE FROM ONEandM;RELEASE TO ANOTHERandM;Q.andP;  I have both Releases 1A and 2.01 of 1-2-3.andP;  Can I get Release 1A toretrieve files that I have created with Release 2.01?andP;  Once I've retrievedthem, can I use Release 1A worksheets in 1-2-3 Release 2.01?andM;Sanjay Jain Rowley, Mass.andM;A.andP;  Release 2.01 of 1-2-3 comes with a Translate utility that converts WK1spreadsheet files into the WKS format of Release 1A.andP;  However, don't expecteverything in a Release 2.01 file to translate.andP;  The Translate utilityconverts any formulas that contain Release 2.01-specific @functions intolabels.andP;  It also truncates any data beyond row 2048.andP;  Formulas that refer toany cell or range beyond A1..IV2048 will be invalid.andM;To use the Translate utility, exit to DOS and make the directory thatcontains your 1-2-3 program files current.andP;  Or insert the 1-2-3 Translatedisk in drive A and make that drive current.andP;  Enter lotus and selectTranslate, or enter trans at the DOS prompt and follow the menus andinstructions that appear on the screen.andM;You don't need to translate files from Release 1A to use them in Release2.01.andP;  Simply retrieve them the way you would if you were using them inRelease 1A.andP;  For more information on this, see &quot;A Compatibility Guide&quot; in theOctober issue.andM;DRIVE ALLWAYS BY MACROSandM;Q.andP;  I bought Allways to improve the look of my 1-2-3 Release 2.01 printouts.andO;In the past I've used macros to create the printouts.andP;  It would be nice if Icould modify the macros to call on Allways so that I don't have to switchover manually when I want to use the add-in.andP;  In other words, how do I get amacro to &quot;press&quot; Alt-F7?andP;  I assume that once Allways is active, a macro willbe able to control things, just as it does in 1-2-3.andM;Robert DePalma Somerville, Mass.andM;A.andP;  When you integrate the 1-2-3 Add-In Manager into your driver set, youautomatically incorporate four new macro commands into 1-2-3.andP;  Those commandsare {APP1}, {APP2}, {APP3}, and {APP4}.andP;  When a macro processes the command{APP1}, it &quot;presses&quot; the key combination Alt-F7.andP;  If there is an add-inattached to that key, the add-in becomes active and, as you have assumed,follows the macro's instructions.andM;The command {APP2} activates an add-in attached to Alt-F8, and the command{APP3} activates an add-in attached to Alt-F9.andP;  The command {APP4} pressesthe key combination Alt-F10, giving your macro access to the 1-2-3 Add-InManager menu.andM;Qandamp;A REVISITEDandM;LIMITED SPREADSHEETandM;The September 1989 Qandamp;A contained a letter from L. A. Meyers who asked what todo about a worksheet that didn't let him insert new rows.andP;  You suggesteddeleting any blank rows that fell below the worksheet data.andP;  I suggest adifferent approach.andM;Use the File Xtract command to save the file, give the extracted file a newname, and indicate only the worksheet area that contains data as the range toextract.andP;  This creates a new disk file.andP;  You can retrieve the new, clean fileand insert rows as needed.andM;Scott A. Carson Indianapolis, Ind.andM;TAKE FILES HOME AGAINandM;The answer to the August 1989 letter Taking Files Home explained how to savea 1-2-3 file on a floppy disk in order to take it home.andP;  You recommendedusing the File Retrieve and File Save commands to make take-home copies.andM;If the files are very large, retrieving them in 1-2-3 or Symphony istime-consuming.andP;  I prefer to work in DOS when copying files to a floppy disk.andM;To do this, save your file, then exit 1-2-3 or Symphony to get to the DOSprompt.andM;Once DOS is active, use the Copy command to copy files to your floppy disk.andO;Say, for example, that you want to copy a file named SALES.WK1 from asubdirectory named C:\REPORT.andP;  At the DOS prompt enter:andM;copy c:\report\sales.wk1 a:andM;When you finish copying files to take home, return to 1-2-3 or Symphony byentering exit at the DOS prompt.andM;When you get home, reverse the commands to copy the file from the floppy diskto your hard disk.andP;  For example, to copy the file into a subdirectory namedC:\WORKFILE, enter:andM;copy a:\sales.wk1 c:\workfileandM;William F. Sutton Provident Mutual Philadelphia, Pa.andM;HARDWAREandM;WHAT CONSTITUTES CLEAN?andM;Q.andP;  We've had a personal computer for several years and we haven't cleaned itin any way.andP;  What's your opinion about how and how often we should clean it?andM;Margie Nelson State Farm Life Insurance Co. Bloomington, Ill.andM;A.andP;  In general, the only reason to clean the outside of your computer is tokeep it looking clean.andP;  It's a good idea to get dust out of the insidewhenever you have occasion to open the box--when inserting a memory card, forinstance.andM;If dirt really builds up on your keyboard, unplug the system and use analcohol-based aerosol spray, then wipe clean with a dry cloth.andP;  Never usewater, which contains minerals that are left behind when it dries.andP;  These areoften charged particles that can cause shorts.andM;Dust in the computer's chassis can cause shorts because dust clumps are oftencharged.andP;  You can use compressed air to blow them out.andM;Hard disks are hermetically sealed, so there's no need to clean them.andM;The only moving parts that dust might interfere with are in the floppy-diskdrives.andP;  If you start having intermittent problems while saving andretrieving files, and if you can't determine that software is the cause,consider cleaning the disk drive's read/write heads.andP;  There are somedrive-head cleaning kits on the market, but they may traumatize the drive asmuch as they help it.andP;  The manufacturer of your computer or a reputabledealership or service center can provide recommendations for cleaning yourequipment.andM;CONTESTandM;CONTEST RESULTSandM;In the October issue we asked users of 1-2-3 Release 2 and higher andSymphony to submit the best formula to generate fiscal years in the format FYXX across a row in a worksheet.andP;  For example, if you enter FY 98 in cell A1,your formula in cell B1 will contain a formula that evaluates to FY 99.andP;  Weasked readers to make sure that the formula works for the year 2000 andbeyond, returning FY 00, FY 01, FY 02, and so on.andM;Shown below is the winning formula, which resides in cell B1 of the figurethat follows the formula:andM;+&quot;FY &quot;andamp;@RIGHT@STRING (@VALUE(@RIGHT(A1,2)) +101,0),2)andM;In the figure below, cell A1 contains FY 98.andP;  Copy cell B1 to range C1..G1.andO;Let's break the formula into five parts:andM;1.andP;  @RIGHT(A1,2) isolates the string representing the year that's located incell A1.andP;  Let's call the result a.andM;2.andP;  @VALUE(a) + 101 converts the string to a value and adds 101 to the yearvalue.andP;  Let's call this b.andM;3.andP;  @STRING(b,0) converts the value to a string with zero decimal places.andO;Let's call the result of this formula c.andM;4.andP;  @RIGHT(c,2) isolates the last two digits of the string representing theyear.andP;  Let's call this result d.andP;  This step is necessary because adding 101to the year value (step 2) means that step 3 will always return a three-digitstring.andP;  The constant 101 becomes important for FY 01 through FY 09.andP;  Using 1rather than 101 as the constant would result in FY 1, FY 2, and so on, whichisn't the result specified in the contest.andM;5.andP;  + &quot;FY &quot;andamp;d concatenates the string &quot;FY &quot; with the two-digit stringrepresenting the year.andM;Winning entries were submitted by the following readers: Ron S.
