The law, passed by Moldavian legislators on Thursday, was acompromise measure meant to appease ethnic Russians and otherminorities who opposed making Moldavian the official language.   In the three Baltic republics, nationalist group leaders sharplycriticized the Kremlin for attacking their efforts to gain moreautonomy. Latvia's activist organization demanded that the centralgovernment recognize the region's ``special economic and politicalstatus.''   The Moldavian Supreme Soviet legislature met today to considerhow to apply the controversial language law. Moldavian was made theofficial language in a show of independence from the Soviet Unionand an attempt to preserve Moldavian culture.   Ethnic Moldavians make up 64 percent of the republic'spopulation, and Russian and other ethnic groups comprise the rest.   The law makes Moldavian the official language of government andeconomic affairs but allows use of both Russian and Moldavian ineveryday life.   The provision that sanctions some use of Russian was aimed atending strikes at an estimated 200 businesses and industries byethnic Russians angered by the law.   Tens of thousands of Moldavians poured into the streets of thecapital, Kishinev, on Thursday night to protest the compromises, andseveral thousand massed again today, official and unofficial sourcessaid.   ``People are disatisfied with all the compromises the deputiesagreed to,'' Konstantin Bogdanash, a journalist with the People'sFront group that has led the campaign for preservation of theMoldavian language, said in a telephone interview.   Bogdanash said protesters outside Kishinev's opera theater, wherethe 350-member Supreme Soviet meets, held signs reading, ``Peoplewant Freedom,'' and ``Respected Russians, Mother Russia Calls YouHome.''   ``The people are scandalized. We need only one language,'' saidVasily Nestase, another People's Front member.   He said the group would call a general strike if the decision isnot reversed and that the next step would be secession from theSoviet Union.   ``We are not a legal part of the Soviet Union,'' Nestase said,pointing to the Soviet annexation of Moldavia from neighboringRomania in 1940 under a Nazi-Soviet agreement of the year before,which also divided Poland and the Baltic states.   The lawmakers on Thursday also restored the Latin alphabet takenaway a half-century ago by dictator Josef Stalin when he annexedMoldavia. Stalin imposed Cyrillic, the alphabet used in Russian, toback his claim that Romanians and Moldavians are two distinctnationalities even though the languages are virtually identical.   A third proposal, which was rejected, would have made Moldavianthe language of communication among Russians, Ukrainians, Jews,Bulgarians, and other nationalities in the republic. Manynon-Moldavians do not speak Moldavian, but generally know someRussian.   Legislators instead opted for an obscurely worded compromise ofbilingualism, similar to that proposed Wednesday by Moldavia'sCommunist Party chief, Semen Grossu, after a conversation withPresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   According to a reporter for ATEM, Moldavia's official newsagency, it reads: ``The Russian language, as the language ofinter-ethnic communication in the U.S.S.R., is used on the territoryof the republic together with Moldavian as a language ofinter-ethnic communication, which ensures the carrying out of realbilingualism between Russian and the national tongue.''   In the Baltics, the leaders of the People's Fronts of Latvia,Lithuania and Estonia reacted to the Communist Party leadership'srecent scathing criticism of their independence movements.   A statement released after a meeting of the three groups in theLatvian capital, Riga, said the party's criticism was adopted``behind the backs of these republics without even the slightestattempt to discuss with them problems closely concerning them,''said Artis Erglis, a secretary of the Latvian People's Front.   ``Whether the authors wanted it or not, as a result in the eyesof many people they look like the brothers of those who dividedzones of influence in 1939 and decided the fate of our sovereignpeople...'' the statement said.   The Latvian People's Front issued a statement today saying itsleaders planned to revise their group's platform to include a callfor complete independence for the republic.   ``Only in an independent, democratic Latvia can an economic andpolitical crisis be overcome,'' the statement said.</TEXT></DOC>
