The company, 67%-owned by the government throughstate-owned Singapore Technologies Holdings, is on a majordrive to boost its commercial aircraft maintenance business,expand internationally and win more sophisticatedaircraft-manufacturing subcontracts.</LP><TEXT>   SAe currently derives about 75% of its revenue fromdefense-related work. Much of that is maintaining andupgrading the Singapore Air Force fleet of A-4 Skyhawks andF-5Es.   The balance of revenue, about 25%, comes from civiliancontracts. But Francis Yuen, assistant vice president forbusiness development, says the company's new strategic plancalls for SAe to raise its civilian maintenance andmanufacturing work to 40% of revenue.   SAe is well along in building a foundation for itsexpansion in the commercial sector. Last year it establisheda maintenance beachhead in the U.S. by purchasing a militaryaircraft hangar in Mobile, Ala., that once serviced B-1bombers. The company spent about $33.7 million Singaporedollars (US$20 million) renovating the hangar and opened itfor business early this year with 400 employees.   Although the U.S. subsidiary, Mobile AerospaceEngineering, posted an operating loss of S$3.5 million(US$2.1 million) in its first six months, Tony Chan, anaerospace analyst for Peregrine Securities Singapore, saysthe purchase price was &quot;a bargain&quot; and applauds theacquisition as &quot;a wonderful move.&quot;   SAe, based at Singapore's Paya Lebar Airport, also hasbroken into the profitable business of doing major structuraloverhaul work on older Boeing Co. 747s. Such work is requiredby the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and othernational aviation agencies on 747s that have made a certainnumber of takeoffs and landings.   SAe's commercial maintenance subsidiary, SingaporeAviation Services Co., or Sasco, won a contract from JapanAirlines to perform the Boeing 747 repairs. Indeed, JALearlier this year bought a 10% stake in Sasco for S$3 millionand designated Sasco one of its &quot;extended aircraftmaintenance centers.&quot; As JAL has the largest 747 fleet in theworld, this tie-up should be a valuable future source ofrevenue.   Singapore Airlines, which has its own massive aircraftengineering division, also bought a 10% stake in Sascoearlier this year. But the home-based airline isn't expectedto become a large customer in the near term.   The Sasco unit is building a two-aircraft maintenancehangar at Singapore's Changi Airport that should be open byearly 1993. With one aircraft bay at Paya Lebar and two atChangi, commercial business easily could exceed 50% ofmaintenance revenue within three years, the company believes.   On the civil manufacturing side, SAe has a number of smallcontracts valued at a total of around $190 million, and saysit expects to announce another contract by the middle of thismonth. Currently, its most important contracts include makingengine parts for United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt andamp; Whitneyengine division, doors for Airbus Industrie A-320 and A-340models and engine mounts for McDonnell Douglas Corp. MD-11s.   &quot;We are still growing,&quot; Mr. Yuen says. &quot;I don't seeourselves building a new plane. We're not in the same leagueas companies like Boeing or Douglas.&quot;   McDonnell Douglas executives have said that SAe is one ofthe five Asian aerospace companies or consortiums beingconsidered for large, risk-sharing contracts on its plannedMD-12 trijet. The plane, a larger, longer-range makeover ofthe existing MD-11, would require a new wing. The U.S. planebuilder has said publicly that it can't afford the $3 billionto $5 billion investment required to develop the new model,and therefore is looking at bringing in Asian partners andeven selling them minority stakes in its Long Beach, Calif.,manufacturing plant.   SAe declined to comment on whether it has been approachedby McDonnell Douglas, or whether it approached the U.S.company.   Since its stock-exchange listing, SAe has made other movesas well, including taking a 20% stake in an Irish companythat re-engines and leases Boeing 727s, and buying 87% of aBritish company that leases and exchanges Boeing 737 spareparts. Now SAe, with its parent company, is exploring theidea of entering the aircraft-leasing business.   &quot;We wouldn't say we're finished with acquisitions,&quot; Mr.Yuen says, adding that SAe also will grow through jointventures and internal projects. &quot;But maintenance will remainour core activity for some time to come.&quot;   Last year the company earned S$21 million on revenue ofS$234 million. Net income in the first six months of thisyear, S$9.5 million, was up 11% from the year-earlier firsthalf. Revenue in the first half soared 65% to S$154 million.Mr. Yuen declines to predict SAe's full-year results.</TEXT></DOC>
