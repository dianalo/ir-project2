It is widely believed that the prosecutor, Lawrence Walsh, decided long ago not to proceed against Mr. McFarlane for his role in the scandal. But the sources now say Mr. Walsh and his staff may seek charges against the former White House aide for allegedly submitting false statements to Congress, or misleading it, about secret administration activities in support of the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.    This latest development makes clear that Mr. Walsh, pushing toward the climax of his 14-month investigation, has switched to a tougher approach with Mr. McFarlane, who would be a key witness in criminal cases that are likely to be brought against others.    The sources stressed that no final decision has been reached by Mr. Walsh and that the matter isn't expected to be resolved for several weeks.    Within the past several weeks, according to the sources, Mr. McFarlane's lawyer, Leonard Garment, met with members of Mr. Walsh's staff and was told that the prosecutor was considering seeking charges against his client.    Mr. Garment, in a telephone interview yesterday, said, &quot;I don't comment on any discussions I have with the independent counsel.&quot; He said that The Wall Street Journal's information was &quot;incomplete&quot; and that the newspaper &quot;is not familiar with the full nature of those discussions.&quot; A spokesman for Mr. Walsh declined comment.    Mr. Walsh's principal targets are Rear Adm. John Poindexter, who succeeded Mr. McFarlane as national security adviser; former White House aide Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North; and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord and Albert Hakim, private operatives who helped run the covert Iran and Contra operations.    Mr. Walsh is moving quickly to wrap up his investigation of the targets. Law enforcement sources said he is considering seeking conspiracy, fraud and other charges. After he completes that phase of his investigation, the special prosecutor plans to focus his inquiry on the activities of some Central Intelligence Agency officials and agents who helped support the Contras when Congress restricted U.S. assistance.    Mr. McFarlane was President Reagan's national security adviser from October 1983 until December 1985. Last May, he testified without seeking immunity from prosecution before the House and Senate Iran-Contra investigating committees. Law-enforcement sources said he hasn't sought immunity in the criminal investigation, either.    During his appearance before the congressional committees, Mr. McFarlane was asked whether he deliberately misled lawmakers about National Security Council activities on behalf of the Contras while he served at the White House or afterward. Mr. McFarlane replied that &quot;I did not give as full an answer as I should have&quot; about such subjects. At another point during the Iran-Contra hearings, he acknowledged &quot;inappropriately&quot; using &quot;some tortured language&quot; in discussing administration efforts to obtain donations from foreign countries for the Contras.    Mr. Walsh, according to sources familiar with his investigation, also is delving into letters Mr. McFarlane sent to lawmakers beginning in 1985 asserting, among other things, that the National Security Council wasn't involved &quot;directly or indirectly&quot; in providing military support for the Contras at a time Congress had restricted such help.    In his testimony to the Iran-Contra committees last year, Mr. McFarlane acknowledged that his responses were &quot;too categorical.&quot; Col. North, who had worked under Mr. McFarlane, told the committees that some of the statements in the letters were &quot;erroneous, misleading, evasive and wrong.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
