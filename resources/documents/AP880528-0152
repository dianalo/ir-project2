Another Iranian official accused the Soviet Union of providingIraq with at least 800 long-range missiles, Iran's official IslamicRepublic News Agency reported.   IRNA quoted the deputy foreign minister, Ali Mohammad Besharati,as saying in Tehran that Baghdad's recent victories were onlypossible with U.S. and Soviet collaboration.   Besharati did not say when Moscow, Iraq's main arms supplier,provided the missiles, according to the report monitored inNicosia. But the Iraqis fired nearly 200 long-range missiles,believed to modified Soviet Scud-B weapons, at Iranian citiesbetween Feb. 29 and April 21.   Khomeini, Iran's 87-year-old revolutionary patriarch, made thedeclaration about battlefield victories despite Iran's admissionthat it suffered recent military defeats in the 7{-year war.   ``The combatants must continue their fight by depending on theirfaith in God and their weapons,'' he said in a statement that hisson, Ahmed, read to the opening session of the Majlis, Iran'sparliament. The statement was broadcast by Tehran Radio, alsomonitored in Nicosia.   ``The fate of the war will be decided on the war fronts, notthrough negotiations,'' Khomeini said. ``Victory will be ours.''   Tehran Radio said President Ali Khamenei acknowledged during aTehran prayer session Friday that the Iraqis defeated Iran's armyin recent weeks.   He gave no details. But the unexpectedly blunt admission clearlyreferred to Iraq's recapture of the Faw Peninsula in southern Iraqon April 18 and an Iranian bridgehead east of the port city ofBasra last week.   The Iranians captured Faw in February 1986 and had held about 76square miles of Iraqi territory east of Basra since early last year.   The Iranians also lost a frigate and a missile craft in clasheswith the U.S. Navy in the gulf April 18. Military analysts saidthat was a serious blow to Iran's naval strength.   Iran had seized the Iraqi territory in two bloody offensives. Itrepresented the main gains it has made in the conflict.   Western military analysts said the setbacks have jolted theTehran leadership at a time of mounting economic woes and a powerstruggle between radicals who want a state-run economy andconservatives who support a capitalist-style system.   Much of Khomeini's statement was devoted to efforts to reformIran's economy.   He urged the 270-seat Majlis to do more for Iran's poor andcalled for cooperation with the 13-member Council of Guardians,which approves laws passed by the parliament. The council,dominated by conservatives, has blocked radical-inspired economiclegislation in recent years.   Radicals seeking economic reforms made major gains at theexpense of the conservatives in the two-stage elections in Apriland May.   Radicals seek price controls, a minimum wage, landredistribution and other measures to help cope with runawayinflation and economic inequities.   Conservative clerics charge the economic reforms violate Islamictenets that property is inviolable. They are supported by thewealthy merchant class. The new four-year parliament is the thirdsince Khomeini's revolution toppled Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in1979.</TEXT></DOC>
