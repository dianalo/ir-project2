Alan Cranston, D-Calif., predictedSunday that $3.5 billion in federal earthquake aid would beapproved this week, but said damage estimates from Tuesday's quakewere already more than twice that amount.   ``Unfortunately, all the cost cannot be covered'' by governmentaid, Cranston told reporters. ``There will be some loss.''   Property losses and damage to local roads are estimated at $6.12billion by local governments, with damage to state and federalhighways at an additional $1 billion, Cranston said.   The senator said state government, with its $1 billion surplus,would have to provide money and the federal government wouldprobably increase its contribution later. In addition, insurancewill cover some losses; Cranston said 15 to 25 percent of damagedcommercial property was insured, but he couldn't say how manydamaged homes carried earthquake coverage.   The $7.12 billion damage total was at least $650 million higherthan the estimate provided Sunday by Lisa Covington, spokeswomanfor the state Office of Emergency Services. But Cranston said thedamage figures were rising constantly and ``will probably go muchhigher before we're finished.''   Cranston, the Senate majority whip, said about $3.5 billion inearthquake aid would be added Monday to a House appropriation billthat must be passed by Wednesday to keep the government functioning.   ``I have no doubt about our capacity to produce that money'' inCongress, Cranston said, predicting no difficulty in getting thevotes to waive the Gramm-Rudman federal spending limit or otherlegal restrictions on federal disaster aid.   ``Every state has had an earthquake,'' he said. ``No senator, noHouse member can say, `This is never going to affect me.'''   Federal aid would include $1.44 billion for the Federal EmergecyManagement Administration, $1 billion in highway funds, $1 billionfor low-interest loans from the Small Business Administration, and$50 million for veterans' hospitals in Palo Alto and Martinez,Cranston said.   He said the first federal funds could be available within a weekfor these programs:   _Temporary housing grants from FEMA for those made homeless bythe earthquake.   _Grants of up to $10,000 from FEMA for family assistance.   _For homeowners without earthquake insurance, SBA loans of up to$100,000 for real estate and up to $20,000 for furniture and otherpersonal property. The 30-year loans would be at 4 percent to 8percent interest.   _For businesses, SBA loans of up to $500,000 to repairearthquake damage or raise working capital because of quake-relatedneeds.   Gov. George Deukmejian has also said the state will providesupplemental grants of up to $10,000 for the neediest families andindividuals.   FEMA officials said Saturday that until federal aid wasapproved, the displaced could seek emergency shelter with the RedCross or pay for a hotel and seek reimbursement from thegovernment. The agency was to open disaster-aid centers Sunday ineach of the seven counties suffering earthquake damage.</TEXT></DOC>
