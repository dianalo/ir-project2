they liberate the oppressed.andM;I had that understanding when I went to the Soviet Union recently, but I cameback feeling I had been naive.andP;  PCs may liberate the intellecturals, but theyare too few and too divorced from daily life in the Soviet Union to have muchimpact on society as a whole.andM;It's easy for us, as mostly middleclass Americans who use computers, toforget just how unusual we are.andP;  We're unusual in the United States, where apopulation of 245 million has about 30 million PCs.andP;  And we're far more rarein the world at large: the Soviet Union, for example, has about 300,000 to400,000 PCs in a population roughly the same size (285 million) as ours.andM;Merely having a PC makes us part of an elite that is divorced from mostpeople's normal experience.andP;  Wide-ranging personal use of PCs puts us in aneven smaller elite.andP;  Even in the United States, typical computer users wouldbe as unlikely to go home and log on to a computer network as to attend apolitical rally.andP;  Of course, in Eastern Europe, a lot of people are showingup at rallies--the question is whether PCs have any significant role inmaking that happen.andM;In the Soviet Union, I didn't find PCs playing a big part in socialmovements.andP;  Managers and bureaucrats benefit from them indirectly, as they dohere.andP;  The Russians who use PCs directly, mostly programmers and scientists,are already part of the Soviet elite.andP;  For them, PCs seem to provide personalsatisfaction and fulfillment--and a means of earnings a living--more than ameans of communication.andM;What seems to be making such more of a difference is television--the simplebroadcasting of information to people who thought they were alone.andP;  As fas asI can tell, it was television--and the press that fed the TV system--morethan PCs that impelled the crowds behind the tattering Iron Curtain.andM;This is true, I believe, because the personal computer remains an elitemachine.andP;  It's a medium for private information, while television is a mediumfor public information.andP;  PCs let you feel you're communicating with someonein particular, whereas television makes you feel like part of a large group.andM;In short, PCs can be used to organize a revolution, while television can beused to garner (or awaken) widespread support.andP;  In China, for example, PCsand fax machines enabled students to communicate with one another and withfriends outside the country, but television enabled them to communicate withthe world at large.andM;This will change, however, when PC and TV technologies converge.andP;  Someday thesame hardware will carry both broadcast and personal information, andfiltering techniques will enable people to personalize the broadcastinformation they receive.andP;  This blended technology will also enable minorityviewpoints to be heard more easily by those who share them, since majoritybroadcasting drowns out all but the most popular voices.andM;Although we think of micros as personal computers, what really makes thempersonal is how they're used, not their technology.andP;  In the Soviet Union mostPCs are used as business, not personal, tools.andP;  In other words, Soviettechnology is shifting from mainframes to micros, but the mindset is stillthat of central control rather than individual empowerment.andM;In that society, PCs' salient capabilities are not personal liberation orinterpersonal communication but economic function, their ability to help theeconomy start moving.andP;  Their primary impact on developing democracy, at leastso far, has been a side effect of this purely economic role.andM;Soviet computers are inert without the economic motive to bring them to lifeand encourage their use and dissemination.andP;  I believe that in the SovietUnion and Eastern Europe, PCs will flourish because of the economicrevolution that is occurring, rather than the other way around.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
