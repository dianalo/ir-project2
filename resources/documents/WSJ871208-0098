TaylorStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/08/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GOVMTBANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK)EARNINGS (ERN) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   U.S. bank profits reached a record $5.8 billion in the third quarter, regulators reported, but heavy Third World loan-loss provisions will keep annual bank profits at their lowest level since the Depression.    &quot;Banking profits are on a roller coaster this year,&quot; said William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The previous record bank earnings of $5.3 billion came in the first quarter, followed by a record $10.6 billion loss in the second quarter, primarily because of $21.2 billion in loan-loss provisions.    Mr. Seidman predicted that earnings fluctuations probably will continue in the fourth quarter, with net income dipping below the average since 1983 of $3.5 billion.    FDIC officials predicted that banks' return on assets would sink to a meager 0.15% to 0.20% this year, compared with a range of 0.64% to 0.78% since 1981.    While big money-center banks have put most of their Third World loan losses behind them, Mr. Seidman said, continuing losses in the energy-producing states of the Southwest are dragging down the profitability of the banking system.    &quot;Clearly, the economy in the Southwest is not improving,&quot; Mr. Seidman said. As a result, he said the FDIC no longer expects bank failures next year to drop 25% from this year's record level of almost 200. The decline now is expected to be smaller than earlier expected.    The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, meanwhile, reported that federally insured thrift institutions registered an aggregate loss of $1.6 billion for the third quarter, primarily because of losses in the oil patch. This was narrower than the $1.8 billion loss in the second quarter, but far worse than thrifts' $35 million loss in the 1986 third quarter.    James Barth, chief economist at the Bank Board, saw hope amid the thrifts' red ink. He said the loan-delinquency rate of thrifts has been dropping steadily since February and thrift losses in the oil patch appear to have stabilized.    He also said the losses are concentrated in a few institutions. About 10% of all thrifts were insolvent, and these lost a total of $2.3 billion, while the other 90% registered a $712 million profit, he said.    As for banks, Third World loan-loss provisions continued to distort performance indicators. Having taken large provisions in the second quarter, banks boosted third-quarter profits by trimming their loss provisions to $3.9 billion, $1.2 billion below the provision for the like period in 1986, the FDIC said.    Overall, FDIC economist Ross Waldrop said that if the Third World provisions are discounted, the banking system's core profitability this year is &quot;virtually flat&quot; compared with 1986, which was a subpar year.    Midwestern banks helped offset the Southwest's decline. Their net income in the third quarter rose 39% from the like period in 1986. FDIC Chairman Seidman credited that largely to continued recovery of farm banks.    And the FDIC was encouraged that the spread is growing between the interest rates banks pay for deposits and those they collect on loans. It said the spread is expected to swell further in the fourth quarter because of an influx of deposits seeking safety following the stock market's decline. </TEXT></DOC>
