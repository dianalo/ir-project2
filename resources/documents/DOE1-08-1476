<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-08-1476 </DOCNO><TEXT>A novel electrochemical technique is being developed for the non-destructivedetermination of the activity of diffusible hydrogen in a wide varietyof metals. A detachable sensor has been constructed, which is based onthe principle of an electrochemical concentration cell. In this cellone of the electrodes is either the sample, or a thin Pd film in directcontact with the sample. The other electrode functions as the reference.The electrolyte is a liquid or solid proton conductor. The method essentiallydiffers from other electrochemical methods in that the disturbance ofthe hydrogen content of the sample is minimal. The prototype sensor hasbeen demonstrated to be useful for many purposes such as corrosion monitoringin the case of hydrogen evolution corrosion, provided that an adequatecalibration procedure is carried out.</TEXT></DOC>
