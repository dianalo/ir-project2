A generation ago, Quebec had the highest birthrate in the freeworld. It was common for French-speaking couples in the province tohave five or more children.   However, in a dramatic shift to fast-paced urban life, Quebecersnow have one of the lowest rates in the West, down from an averageof 4.5 children to just 1.4.   Concerned that any decline in its 6.6 million population willeventually doom the continent's only French society, the governmenthas announced a package of incentives to encourage a new baby boom.   To begin with, the province will hand out $405 for a couple'sfirst child and $405 for a second child. For a third child and eachsubsequent child, parents will get $2,430 in quarterly installmentsover two years.   The bonuses apply to both married and single parents.   Premier Robert Bourassa's Liberal government has promised 60,000new day- care spaces over the next seven years; no more taxes onfamily allowances; and an interest-free loan of $5,670 to helpfamilies with two or more children buy their first home.   If all that doesn't work, there could be more, Bourassa said inan interview. ``We'll see in the next budget,'' he said.   ``As the leader of the only French-speaking organized society inNorth America, I have a responsibility. We've had a spectaculardecline in demography.''   The aim is to boost the birth rate to 1.8 in the next five years.   France Guerette and her husband, Pierre Blouin, new parents ofquadruplets, were among the first couples to reap the benefits oflast week's handout. With six children in all, they will get $9,720in bonuses alone.   ``We are so very happy. It will certainly help,'' said Guerette.   But some people doubt the policy can reverse a trend that beganwith Quebec's so-called Quiet Revolution in the 1960s, a culturalawakening led by the urban-based Liberal Party that spawnedeconomic reforms and a new emphasis on education. Church influencedeclined as young people left rural areas for the cities.   Power shifted from the English minority to the 81-percent Frenchmajority during the 1970s, a tumultuous decade of separatistsentiment that subsided when voters rejected a sovereigntyreferendum in 1980.   Since then, Quebecers have focused on improved living standardsand competitiveness. The province boasted 5 percent real growthlast year and produced 40 percent of Canada's businessadministration students.   ``In one generation, Quebec women became the biggest consumersof the pill,'' said Montreal Mayor Jean Dore, who says the islandcore of his city has 1.9 million inhabitants but could sustain 3.5million.   Quebec was also the first Canadian province to permit abortionon demand.   Sociologist Morton Weinfeld of Montreal's McGill Universitywarned that the handouts could backfire by creating morewelfare-dependent poor children while failing to encourage upwardlymobile couples to have babies.   ``Then the problem is that society is going to have to provideadequate social services and education to give these children anequal opportunity,'' Weinfeld said.   Indeed, Montrealers Fred and Sylvie Bush, who earn $60,750 ayear between them and just bought a new house, said the baby boompolicy won't influence them.   ``We're not going to start making babies tomorrow,'' said Bush,30. ``We want to keep our lifestyle,'' his wife added.   University of Montreal demographer Jacques Henripin suggestedlonger paid maternity leave and better part-time job opportunitiesas the long-term solution. ``Nobody is going to have a child justto get $405,'' he said.   The government has one other tool to boost population growth.Quebec will welcome 27,000 immigrants this year and is eager totake more, provided they remain in the province and educate theirchildren in French.</TEXT></DOC>
