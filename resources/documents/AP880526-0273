Over five days of talks in the Kremlin beginning Sunday, Reaganand Soviet Communist Party General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev arenot expected to produce the nuclear-arms treaty that they oncehoped to sign in Moscow. Nor are they expected to announce anybreakthroughs on other subjects.   ``The headline of this summit is that there is no headline _ thesummit that didn't bark,'' said Stephen Sestanovich, a formerNational Security Council staff member who runs the Soviet studiesprogram at the Center for Strategic and International Studies inWashington.   ``This is not a high-water mark,'' said Rozanne Ridgway, anassistant secretary of state. ``It's sort of like catching yoursecond wind.''   White House communications director Tom Griscom said, ``Maybe wecan get away from the fact that you only meet because you signarms-control agreements because there are other things that areimportant too: human rights, regional concerns, people-to-peopleexchanges.''   Reagan said he even has some suggestions for Gorbachev aboutways to improve the troubled Soviet economy.   If nothing more, the summit will move the spotlight for Reaganaway from embarrassing controversies about the now-failednegotiations to remove Panamanian ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega, theconflict-of-interest investigations of Attorney General Edwin Meeseand unflattering portraits of Reagan in books written by formerWhite House aides.   For his part, Gorbachev will reap benefits because the summitshould bolster his prestige in advance of a rare Communist Partyconference later in the month on his program of economic and socialreforms.   ``The visit allows him to demonstrate that he has been able tore-engage with the United States, with the West, that he has beenable to produce from that dialogue agreements, such as INF (theIntermediate-range Nuclear Forces missile treaty signed inDecember) ... that he can describe, as we do, a relationship whichis now more predictable,'' Mrs. Ridgway said.   ``Going into whatever meetings he's going into, that would standas an accomplishment,'' she said.   A senior U.S. government official said it would be a successfulsummit for Gorbachev just getting ``the most conservative presidentin U.S. history coming to the Soviet Union.   In his public appearances in Moscow, Reagan plans to offerencouragement for Gorbachev's reforms and express hope for more.   ``Broadly, what you hope will come out of it would be torecognize that the relationship between the United States andSoviet Union has changed,'' Griscom said.   ``The issues that we talk about are much broader now,'' he said.``It's not just a narrow agenda. It's a full agenda and it ought tostay that way.'' Griscom said Reagan's tactics should stand as amodel for his successors.   Helmut Sonnenfeldt, a former State Department and NSC staffer,said Reagan's visit has ``symbolic and political significance'' bythe mere fact that it coincides with the withdrawal of Soviettroops from Afghanistan.   ``From the standpoint of this president, this coincidence of hisappearing in Moscow while the world's television screens are fullof Soviet forces leaving Afghanistan ... is a kind of vindicationof what this president said he was setting out to do when hestarted in 1981, which was to slow down the momentum of Sovietexpansion,'' Sonnenfeldt said.   The only thing that is guaranteed at the summit is a series ofphoto opportunties against carefully picked backgrounds.   The news simply may be the remarkable nature of the event.   Begin with the fact that no American president has visitedMoscow in 14 years.   Moreover, only three presidents _ Franklin Roosevelt, RichardNixon and Gerald Ford _ have ever set foot in the Soviet Union.   Four years ago it seemed likely Reagan would wind up as thefirst American president since World War II not to have a summitwith the Soviet leader.   Now it turns out he will have had more superpower summits thanany other president _ four in just 30 months.   It is a remarkable turnabout for Reagan, who earlier in hispresidency called the Kremlin an ``evil empire'' and describedU.S.-Soviet relations as ``a conflict between good and evil.'' Atough line of anti-communist rhetoric had been Reagan's trademarkfor four decades as he preached a gospel of military strength.   ``Who would have thought in the early '80s, both in the SovietUnion and the U.S.A., that it would be President Reagan who wouldsign with us the first nuclear arms reduction treaty in history,''Gorbachev mused in an interview with The Washington Post.   Gorbachev said, ``Realism is an important quality in PresidentReagan ... By this I mean the ability to adapt one's views to thechanging situation, while remaining faithful to one's convictions.''   Reagan and Gorbachev held their first meeting in Geneva inNovember 1985, and set a goal of a 50 percent cut in strategicnuclear weapons and began a course of lowering East-West tensions.   Eleven months later, they met in Reykjavik, Iceland, where theycame close to reaching sweeping arms agreements but, instead,parted in anger over a dispute about the U.S. Strategic DefenseInitiative _ Star Wars.   They papered over the Star Wars disagreement when they heldtheir third summit in Washington last December. The meeting wascrowned by the signing of the INF treaty.   Reagan now considers Gorbachev a real friend, despite theirdisagreements. He says the Soviet leader, unlike his predecessors,is not bent on world domination but content to see the superpowerslive together in peace.   In Gorbachev, Reagan has a formidable rival, whose apparentself-confidence, media polish and style appeal to Westeners.   In fact, Americans view Gorbachev almost as favorably as they doReagan, and the Soviet leader outpolls the president amongcollege-educated Americans, according to a Media General-AssociatedPress survey.   The leaders will get intense media exposure in meetingsbeginning Sunday and ending Thursday. In addition to talks at theKremlin, they will host elegant dinners for each other and attendthe Bolshoi Ballet with their wives.   Reagan is not expected to jump out his limousine and wade into astreet crowd, as Gorbachev did in Washington. But the president hasplenty of attention-grabbing events on his agenda. He plans tovisit the Danilov Monastery in Moscow to talk about freedom ofreligion. Reagan also will meet with Soviet dissidents and``refuseniks'' who are denied permission to emigrate.   Reagan is to have lunch at the Union of Writers with artists,filmmakers, intellectuals and others to discuss freedom ofexpression.   In addition, the president is to deliver an address onU.S.-Soviet relations at Moscow University and then conduct aquestion-and-answer session with students.   He also plans a news conference at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.   A room in the Kremlin has been reserved and time set asideWednesday for the signing of any agreements, such as a minor pacton missile-testing notification, anti-cheating provisions forpeaceful nuclear explosions and monitoring steps at nuclear testsites.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for AMs Sun May 29 and thereafter</NOTE></DOC>
