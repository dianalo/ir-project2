This kind of illness ``is essentially invisible to the public.Because occupational disease has a long latency period and mimicsother illnesses, most who suffer from it do not even know theycontracted their disease in the workplace,'' the report said.   The researchers blame much of the problem on the federalgovernment through what it argued was under funding of enforcementagencies and inadequate standards.   The report estimated that occupational diseases _ includingcancer and pulmonary, neurological and cardiovascular diseasescaused by hazards on the job _ killed between 47,377 and 95,479Americans in 1987. The estimate was based on a study of datacollected by the National Center for Health Statistics, agovernment agency.   The study did not consider on-the-job injuries, which in 1987killed about 11,100 people and disabled 1.8 million, according tothe Bureau of Labor Statistics.   The report said its estimate is consistent with others. It notedthat a 1985 study by the congressional Office of TechnologyAssessment estimated that American workers get 390,000 job-relatedillnesses every year, and 100,000 die.   ``Even though it is not recognized as such, occupational diseaseis clearly one of the most significant causes of premature death inthe U.S. today,'' said the report.   Dr. Stephen Hessl of the University of Illinois School ofMedicine and Dr. Howard Frumkin of Emory University directed thestudy for the institute, a nonprofit research and educationorganization financed by foundations and individual donations.   The institute said the federal government's response to theproblem has been ``timid.''   Federal spending on workplace health and safety failed to keeppace with inflation during the Reagan administration in the 1980s,it said. From 1981 to 1989, spending in this area increased just 12percent, from $429 million to $481 million, while the ConsumerPrice Index rose 36 percent.   The researchers also criticized the Occupational Safety andHealth Administration for often setting permissible workplacelevels of air pollution and exposure to poisons higher thanrecommended by the National Institute of Occupational Safety andHealth or permitted by the Environmental Protection Agency forsociety at large, they said.   ``It is outrageous, for example, that it is permissible forworkers to be routinely exposed to levels of sulfur dioxide in theair that are over 62 times that which is considered a healthy levelfor nonworkers,'' the researchers said.   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration is part of theLabor Department. The National Institute of Occupational Safety andHealth is part of the Department of Health and Human Services.   Alan McMillan, deputy assistant labor secretary in charge ofOSHA, said the report overall raised important issues, but he saidhe had not read the report thoroughly yet and could not commentfurther in detail.   However, McMillan said OSHA and the National Institute ofOccupational Safety and Health face different legal requirements insetting exposure standards.   The institute is responsible for recommending safe exposurelevels based solely on the worker's health. OSHA, however, mustalso consider technical feasibility and economic impact.   ``For that reason, in most cases you'll likely see a differencein an OSHA standard and a NIOSH recommendation,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
