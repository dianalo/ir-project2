RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today refused to let Montanasheep owners kill grizzly bears threatening their herds.   The court, over one dissenting vote, rejected arguments that theowners have a constitutional right to protect their property _ evenif it means killing animals designated an endangered species.   Justice Byron R. White voted to hear arguments in the case butfour votes are needed to grant such review.   The case stemmed from an incident involving Richard Christy, whoowned 1,700 head of sheep grazing on land near Glacier National Parkin Montana.   Christy said that in July 1982 bears began attacking his herd ona nightly basis.   A herder employed by Christy had only limited success infrightening the bears away with fires and by shooting into the air.   Christy also sought help from Kenneth Wheeler, a trapper workingfor the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Wheeler set snares tocapture the bears, but by July 9, 1982, bears had killed about 20sheep worth at least $1,200.   That night Christy fatally shot a grizzly after it emerged fromthe forest and moved toward his herd.   Two weeks later, having lost 84 sheep to the bears, Christyremoved his herd from the land he had leased from the BlackfeetIndian Tribe. The tribe refunded money Christy paid them to leasethe land. Christy said he was forced to sell the flock at slaughtervalue and lost more than $10,000.   The Department of the Interior fined Christy $2,500 for violatingthe federal Endangered Species Act. Grizzlies are protected underthe law.   Christy then sued the government, claiming the lawunconstitutionally deprived him of his property. He was joined bytwo other sheep owners, Thomas Guthrie and Ira Perkins of TetonCounty, Mont.   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last September upheld afederal judge's ruling dismissing the suit.   ``We decline plaintiffs' invitation to construe the FifthAmendment as guaranteeing the right to kill federally protectedwildlife in defense of property,'' the appeals court said.   The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution bars the government fromconfiscating private property without just compensation.   The appeals court said the Endangered Species Act reasonablyrequires livestock owners to seek help from the government ``ratherthan leaving every individual free to kill a nuisance bear wheneverhe or she deems it necessary.''   The sheep owners said the regulation is unreasonable because, asin Christy's case, when the government is incapable of helping thereis no recourse for them.   They also argued that the law is irrational because it permitssportsmen to kill up to 25 grizzlies annually in some designatedareas.   But the 9th Circuit court said that rule is reasonable because itis ``a carefully controlled seasonal hunt'' aimed at reducingregional over-population of grizzlies.   The appeals court said the sheep owners ``contend that byprotecting grizzly bears the Department (of Interior) hastransformed the bears into `governmental agents' who have physicallytaken the plaintiffs' property.''   ``Undoubtedly the bears have physically taken the plaintiffs'property, but the plaintiffs err in attributing such takings to thegovernment,'' the appeals court said.   The appeal acted on today was supported by, among others, theAmerican Farm Bureau Federation, the National Cattlemen'sAssociation, the American Sheep Industry and sheep owners inColorado, Idaho and Wyoming.   The case is Christy vs. Lujan, 88-1461.</TEXT></DOC>
