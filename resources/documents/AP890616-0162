SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The State Department issued a travel alertFriday to call attention to stepped-up anti-terrorist precautions atFrankurt airport in West Germany and the conclusion of authoritiesthere that terrorist attacks ``cannot be ruled out.''   The department did not advise travelers to avoid the airport,believed by many investigators to have been the place where a bombwas placed on the Pan American jetliner that exploded over Scotlandin December with 270 deaths.   The alert quoted from a statement issued by German officials fromthe state of Hesse, which said:   ``Security measures at Frankfurt airport remain at a high level.This is primarily due to the aggravated situation in the Arabregion. Terrorist actions, especially in the area of the Frankfurtairport, cannot be ruled out. The security measures tie in with aninvestigative proceeding against a terrorist organization which hasbecome active in the Frankfurt area.''   In a similar announcement Tuesday, police in Frankfurt said theywere searching for Palestinian terrorists who might be planningattacks in West Germany.   Kurt Kraus, a Frankfurt police spokesman, said the search andsecurity alert was linked to ``recent activities of terror groups inthe Middle East'' and there appeared to be a connection with theconviction of TWA hijacker Mohammed Ali Hamadi.   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, was sentenced to life in prisonafter being convicted by a Frankfurt court in May on charges of airpiracy and murder in the 1985 TWA hijacking.   A U.S. Navy diver was killed and 39 Americans were held for 17days during the ordeal.   Federal prosecutors have said they believe the suspectedterrorists to be members of a group called the Popular Front for theLiberation of Palestine-General Command.   The Syrian-supported group has been mentioned as a prime suspectin the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.   Police raids last October uncovered weapons and explosives and 14Palestinians were arrested. Warrants have since been issued for fourof the suspects.   Kraus said police suspect other members of the group are still atlarge in West Germany.</TEXT></DOC>
