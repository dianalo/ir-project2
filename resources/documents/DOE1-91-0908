The hydrolysis ofphosphoramide mustard in sodium phosphate buffers was found to followapparent first-order kinetics. The rate of hydrolysis was temperatureand pH dependent, being slower under acidic conditions. At pH valuesabove the pKa of the phosphoramide mustard nitrogen, the major hydrolyticpathway was via the formation of the aziridinium ion, followed by nucleophilicattack. At pH values below its pKa, cleavage of the P-N bond predominated.The dispositions of phosphoramide mustard and nornitrogen mustard followingiv injections were studied in rats using GC-MS stable isotope assays.</TEXT></DOC>
