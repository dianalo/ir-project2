(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The TV ministry formerly run by Jim andTammy Bakker has dropped the name PTL in an effort to dissociateitself from PTL's bankrupt commercial operations.   The network ministry show formerly called ``PTL Today'' went onthe air without a name Tuesday morning, and viewers were asked tosend donations to a new entity called Heritage Ministries, not PTL.   ``The address is the same, but for the first time you can write`Heritage Ministries' on your checks,'' Heritage Village ChurchPastor Sam Johnson said Tuesday in a guest appearance on the show.   Heritage Ministries must operate independently of PTL'scommercial operations, including the Heritage Park Christian themepark, beginning Monday, PTL Trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton saidTuesday. PTL is trying to sell those properties to settle its debts.   ``Heritage Ministries is on its own next week,'' Benton said.``They've been learning to stand and now they have to go on theirown legs.''   The television show sported a new look Tuesday. Johnson appearedon a set featuring leather furniture and a study with a bookcasebackdrop. He said the set cost less than $900. The old set waslarger, had more furniture, and gave the appearnace of a large,informal family room.   ``We're starting brand new,'' Johnson said. ``We don't have anymoney or any debts.''   In addition to the name change, Heritage Ministries is tryingwin authorization from the Internal Revenue Service as a tax-exemptorganization.   PTL was forced into bankruptcy after Bakker resigned followingthe revelation that he had a sexual liaison with church secretaryJessica Hahn and paid her hush money.   Heritage Ministries Interim President Don Edwards said the newministry has been incorporated since May 25 and has a budget basedon an expected $60,000 a day in donations.   Donations have been running well below that level for the lastmonth, but Benton said he thought many supporters were holding backuntil the new ministry started.   ``We hope to get off to a good start,'' Benton said. ``We'llknow Monday what kind of response we're getting from our partners.''   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds on July 19 gave HeritageMinistries 30 days to prove it is financially viable, Edwards said.</TEXT></DOC>
