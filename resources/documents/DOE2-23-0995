One of the promisingalternatives is low temperature conversion of sludge into fuel. Accordingto this process a pilot plant operates in Canada and in the course of1988 a complete factory will be built. The principles of this sludgeprocess is discussed shortly. The reactorsystem on a laboratory scaleis presented schematic. The pilot plant is described. Results and operatingconditions of the laboratory setting-up and the pilot plant have beencompared. Costs of the sludge process are determined. Potential advantagesof the thermal conversion of sludge into fuel are mentioned. 4 figs.,6 refs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
