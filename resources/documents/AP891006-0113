Surgeons called the benign growth a mucous cyst, or ganglion.These cysts usually occur, as did the president's, between the lastjoint and the finger nail. They are not painful and usually don'taffect the function of the finger. But mucous cysts are susceptibleto infection that can be quite serious.   ``Ganglions or mucous cysts are the most common form of benignlittle tumors that occur in the hand,'' said Dr. Mary H. McGrath, ahand surgeon at George Washingtion University Medical Center.``They are associated, generally speaking, with some sort ofinjury, often trivial.''   Bush, she said, ``is very characteristic'' of the people who getmucous cysts ``because he is active and plays sports.''   The cysts are filled with a clear, jelly-like material that isthe same as the fluid that lubricates joints, she said. The smallgrowths are never malignant, but doctors usually recommend thatthey be removed.   ``One of the bad things about these (cysts) is that they arisefrom the joint and, consequently, if they break and get infectedthe person can get an infection in the joint at the end of thefinger,'' said McGrath. Such an infection ``is very hard to clearup'' and can sometimes result in amputation.   ``It's very common for people to have no idea what the cyst isand they drain it themselves,'' she said. ``That can lead to bigproblems.''   Often, these cysts can press against the bed of the fingernail,leading to a groove or some other deformity in the nail.   McGrath has not examined Bush and is not personally connectedwith his case, but she said the typical removal of a mucous cyst isa safe, but ``meticulous,'' procedure that takes just over an hour.   First, the finger is deadened with what is called a digitalnerve block. This is done by shooting an anesthetic into a nerve inthe hand, wrist or arm. Then an incision is made.   ``You go in through the skin on the back of the finger and peelout the cyst,'' she said. ``Then you follow the stalk back to thejoint.''   The stalk, or root, of the cyst must be removed or the growthcould recur.   After that, the skin is sewn back together and the finger isbandaged. Often a splint is worn until the stitches are removed,about a week after surgery.   Recovery is usually complete and uneventful, she said, whichmeans the president may be back on the tennis court or pitchinghorseshoes again within a short time.</TEXT></DOC>
