(AP)  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Richard Dortch, former PTL vice president, was sentenced to eight years in prison and fined $200,000 yesterday for helping to bilk millions of dollars out of the television ministry's followers.    Mr. Dortch's sentence was part of a plea agreement made in exchange for testimony against his former employer, PTL founder Jim Bakker. Mr. Bakker's trial on the same fraud and conspiracy charges is scheduled to open Monday.    The prosecution charged that one building project alone generated $74.2 million but only $11.4 million was spent on construction at the uncompleted facility. </TEXT></DOC>
