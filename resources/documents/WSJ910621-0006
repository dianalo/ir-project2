Although the bottom of the range of analysts' estimates isa $5 million loss, that would be a sharp improvement from the1990 second-quarter loss of $16.3 million. The company makesa preferred dividend payout of a little more than $10 milliona quarter. As a result, Maxus said, estimates of asecond-quarter loss of 10 cents to 15 cents a share soundright. The company posted a loss of 30 cents a share in theyear-earlier period.</LP><TEXT>   For the full year, analysts estimate Maxus will report netincome of $35 million to $45 million, which would equal aloss of five cents a share to a profit of five cents a shareafter the preferred payout. In 1990, Maxus earned $7.3million, representing a loss of 38 cents a share, on sales of$685.4 million.   &quot;Operationally, everything is on plan,&quot; said CharlesBlackburn, the company's chairman and chief executiveofficer. The oil company is consolidating its U.S. operationswhile aggressively expanding its overseas oil production andexploration acreage.   &quot;What's bad is {natural} gas prices,&quot; Mr. Blackburn said.&quot;They've hurt everyone.&quot; Spot natural gas prices on the U.S.Gulf Coast are currently around $1.20 per 1,000 cubic feet,which Mr. Blackburn said is 30 cents lower than expectations.A mild winter and weak demand have reduced revenue fornatural gas producers in general this year.   The weak prices forced Maxus to reduce its 1991 capitalspending budget to $250 million from $290 million, notcounting possible acquisitions, Mr. Blackburn said. He saidMaxus expects oil and gas prices to rise with inflation overthe next few years and then to show modest inflationadjustedgrowth later in the 1990s.   The executive said there are many moderate-sized oil andgas producing properties currently for sale in the U.S. andthat Maxus will participate on both ends of transactions.&quot;We're going to buy about $100 million of property this yearand sell $100 million,&quot; he estimates, as the company seeks&quot;geographic consolidation.&quot;   Maxus is one of the most aggressive overseas explorersamong independent oil companies its size. The company hasbeen expanding its production in Indonesia, for instance,which accounts for the bulk of its international oil output.This year, Maxus's share of average production from largefields in southeast Sumatra will double to about 55,000barrels a day.   In Java, Mr. Blackburn said, Maxus is a 25% partner in aventure trying to get government consent to develop a largegas field at a possible cost of several hundred milliondollars. The company also is doing seismic tests off thecoasts of Tasmania and New Zealand, he said.   In South America, Maxus has exploratory acreage inEcuador, Chile, Bolivia and Colombia, where Maxus recentlyannounced a significant wildcat gas discovery.   Maxus plans to drill wells in Egypt in the second half ofthe year. The company suspended operations in Ethiopiabecause of the civil war there, but it hopes to do moreseismic tests when political stability returns, Mr. Blackburnsaid. Maxus also recently drilled a dry hole in Spain, and itplans to drill in the United Kingdom next year.   Maxus is going into Eastern Europe, too, having reachedvarious agreements to work in Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia.Mr. Blackburn said Bulgaria has proven basins that have thepotential to produce gas that would be sold within thecountry. &quot;We're pretty enthused by Eastern Europe,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
