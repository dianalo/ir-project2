KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., said Friday that headvised the White House not to name Donald Gregg to a top CIA postbecause ``he had become somewhat controversial during theIran-Contra hearings.''   When George Bush was vice president, Gregg was his nationalsecurity adviser. President Bush has since nominated Gregg tobecome U.S. ambassador to South Korea, and the nomination is stuckin the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   Boren, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said heacted because he believed ``that the agency, because of the natureof its work, did not need additional controversy at this time.''   ``It in no way means that I feel that Mr. Gregg should beautomatically disqualified for other government positions,'' Borensaid.   ``My personal opinion that he should not be named to a CIA postwas simply based upon my view that he had become somewhatcontroversial during the Iran-Contra hearings,'' Boren said.   Bush's nomination of Gregg to be ambassador to South Korea isstalled in the Foreign Relations Committee because of Gregg'srelationships to key figures in the Iran-Contra affair.   He also faces allegations that he may have been involvedpersonally in the illegal resupply of military aid to theNicaraguan Contra rebels at a time when that was forbidden byCongress.   Boren said his committee has never held formal discussions aboutGregg's qualifications to serve in any post in government.   He added that Gregg's nomination as ambassador has not promptedhim to reopen the Iran-Contra investigation.   ``No one should draw the conclusion that I would support thereopening of the Iran-Contra investigation by the Congress on amajor scale,'' Boren said. ``The Congress has other problems toconfront. The Iran-Contra matter is now appropriately in thecourts.''   Boren said that other than helping to resolve problems aboutsome of the documents related to the original congressional probe,``I would personally be opposed to reopening the investigation on amajor scale and have to this point seen no evidence which wouldjustify it.''   Boren said he is not privy to any information regarding Greggother than what already has been made public.   Gregg's nomination is opposed by Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.,who has repeatedly asked the White House to withdraw it.   Cranston has vowed to hold additional hearings to probe Gregg'slinks to the Iran-Contra affair, warning that the results might beembarrassing to both Gregg and the president.   Cranston says he is considering calling other witnesses toobtain their testimony under oath but has made no decisions.   Gregg has told Senate supporters he had sought to be named to apost for which Senate confirmation is needed in order to force theissue, confront the suspicions about his role, and give himself anoportunity to clear his name.</TEXT></DOC>
