West German authorities suspended military air shows following the crash Sunday of three Italian jets during a show at the U.S. Air Force base in Ramstein. One of the jets crashed into the crowd of spectators, killing at least 45 and injuring hundreds.    The West German suspension will last at least until safety procedures are reviewed. At a minimum, aviation experts expect that some flight procedures that allow planes to fly over crowds would be barred.    Whether other nations might reduce military air shows or curtail certain maneuvers is an open question. In the U.S., the commander of the Air Force's demonstration team, the Thunderbirds, said in an interview that &quot;I hope we don't knee-jerk&quot; in reaction to the Italian crash. Lt. Col. Stephen Trent, commander of the Thunderbirds, stressed that his unit already had developed sophisticated safety procedures and that spectators have never been harmed at a Thunderbird air show. Since they were organized in 1953, however, 19 Thunderbird pilots have been killed in accidents.    Military authorities here and abroad are likely to resist curtailing air shows because they are viewed as valuable aids in recruiting and retaining personnel. &quot;Sure, the air shows cost bucks, but so does advertising, and the air shows are a proven recruiting tool,&quot; said a former U.S. Defense Department official.    A U.S. Navy study showed that nearly 40% of students entering flight school cited a performance by the Blue Angels, the Navy's demonstration team, as a direct influence on their decision to enter the service, according to the Associated Press. A major air show typically draws several hundred thousand spectators.    While military services aim to boost recruiting, aerospace companies support air shows, such as the Farnborough Air Show to be held in Britain next week, to sell jets and aviation equipment. Publicly, the companies vow to continue demonstrating their products at the shows.    &quot;It's a way to showcase the latest in aeronautical technology in one place to customers from around the world,&quot; said a spokesman for McDonnell Douglas Corp., maker of the F-15 fighter. General Dynamics Corp., another fighter-plane builder, will have three of its F-16s at Farnborough, two on the ground and one flying in daily demonstrations. &quot;We anticipate no immediate change in our participation in air shows,&quot; a General Dynamics spokesman said.    Privately, however, the aerospace companies have long complained about the costs of air shows. A major show, such as Farnborough or the Paris Air Show, can cost a company well over $1 million for flight demonstrations, hotels and other expenses.    Company executives also complain that sales of aircraft aren't accomplished at shows; that comes when customers set up technical teams to evaluate a plane's cost, range, speed, fuel consumption and, for military craft, its ability to accelerate quickly, make tight turns and its electronic-warfare capability. &quot;Nobody buys an airplane over a martini at the air show,&quot; said a salesman for one aerospace company. But aerospace executives feel constrained to attend the shows anyway for fear that missing contact with a customer may allow a competitor an advantage.    Whatever their merits in recruiting or selling planes, the safety of military air shows is difficult to evaluate. Efforts initiated last May to obtain data on Navy air shows from Navy officials have so far been unavailing. And the Air Force Safety Center at Norton Air Force Base in California said it doesn't even keep statistics that would show the incidence of accidents at shows.    But aviation experts acknowledged that there has been a steady drumbeat of accidents at shows over the years. In most cases only the pilots are killed, and after a brief flurry of news reports, the incident is forgotten by the public. In one of the worst accidents on record, a U.S. Army helicopter crashed near Mannheim, West Germany, in September 1982. The helicopter, filled with British, French and German parachutists who planned to jump over the air-show grounds, suffered a mechanical breakdown. As a result, the forward rotor blades severed the rear rotor blades, the craft turned upside down, plummeted to the ground and exploded. All 46 aboard were killed.    ---         Major International Air Shows Through 1989 SHOW (LOCATION)                                 DATE 1988 Farnborough International '88                Sept. 4-11 (Great Britain) Australian Bicentennial Air Show             Oct. 7-16 (Richmond, Australia) - Shanghai Air Show (China)                    Dec. 4-10 1989 Aero '89 (Messegelande,                      April 5-7 Friedrichshafen, West Germany) Paris Air Show                               June 9-18 International Air Tattoo                     July 21-23 (Fairford, Great Britain) Air Show Canada                              Aug. 9-13 (Abbotsford, British Columbia)</TEXT></DOC>
