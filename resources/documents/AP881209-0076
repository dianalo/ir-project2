In the Soviet city of Votkinsk, American inspectors suspended thepolicy prohibiting alcohol after their Soviet escorts brought inpastries and wine.   Americans are in the Soviet Union to verify that the Soviets nolonger produce SS-20 missiles at the Votkinsk Machine BuildingPlant. The Soviets are here to make sure no more Pershing IImissiles are built at the Hercules Aerospace plant in Magna.   President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev signedthe INF Treaty in Washington on Dec. 7, 1987. The agreement, whichbans medium-range nuclear missiles, took effect in June. Salt LakeCounty and Votkinsk are the only two permanent inspection sitesnamed in the treaty.   ``What we're doing today is starting a joint cultural tradition,with the celebration of the signing of the treaty that brings youhere to Utah,'' James Szatkowski, U.S. site commander, said duringthe party.   As many as 30 Soviet inspectors will serve two- and three-monthduty tours for the next 13 years in Salt Lake County under terms ofthe treaty.   ``There's certainly a sense of history in what we're about hereand a sense of pioneering in the area of peace,'' Szatkowski said.``I think we're all proud to be a part of this exciting time ininternational history.''</TEXT></DOC>
