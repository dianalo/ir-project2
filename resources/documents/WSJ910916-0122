Mr. Delors's proposal wings three birds with one shot. Itwould greatly minimize the human risks of a continuedunraveling of agricultural production and distribution inRussia and the other republics this fall. It would provide aninstant, prepaid market to hard-pressed Polish,Czechoslovakian and Hungarian farmers and food distributors.And, 'voila]' it would relieve some of the moral pressure onthe EC to open its own consumer markets to Poland,Czechoslovakia and Hungary, a concession France in particularresists because of objections from its farmers.</LP><TEXT>   The scale of the project would be enormous. Sovietcaretaker Prime Minister Ivan S. Silayev, in a letter toCommission Vice President Frans Andriessen, said his countryneeds no less than 5.5 million tons of grain, 800,000 tons ofmeat, 900,000 tons of sugar and various smaller quantities of15 other products. The total value of his request is morethan $6 billion.   So Mr. Delors has designed a three-way aid program,marrying food needs in Russia to market needs in centralEurope to protectionist politics in Western Europe. Isn'tthis a very happy solution all the way around? Yes and no.   Certainly it is a good answer for the short term, that isto say the coming winter. If the Soviet food-distributionsystem has broken down as badly as observers say -- and keepin mind that the problem was greatly exaggerated last year --then this is a good quick fix. Central European truckers,using fuel supplied from the West and their knowledge of theU.S.S.R. from past Comecon trade experience, could haulsurplus agricultural products directly to food-distributionpoints. Shipments could bypass the decrepit Soviet transportsystem.   The danger is that politicians might get addicted to thisapproach. As with Europe, the U.S. has made use of subsidizedfood shipments as a way of ridding itself of surpluses andkeeping farmers and agribusiness interests happy. Dwayne O.Andreas, chairman of Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. (ADM), hasbeen promoting this activity for years and making a very goodthing of it for ADM, a major U.S. grain processor. To helpkeep the politics going its way, ADM has been a leader amongU.S. corporations in political-campaign contributions. A goodfriend and business associate of Mr. Andreas, Robert S.Strauss, is the new U.S. ambassador to Moscow.   If it were only a matter of politics, the U.S. and the ECshould happily subsidize food shipments to the Soviet Unionuntil kingdom come. But economics intrudes into this happyscenario with a jarring message: Continuation of subsidizedfood shipments will only promote continued poverty for Europefrom the Oder-Neisse Line to the Urals, and over time it canonly make Western Europe and the U.S. less rich than theymight otherwise be. The proper course, in terms of soundeconomics, is to help the post-communist nations build theirown private, free-market agriculture.   It is good economics because restoring agriculture is thequickest way to set the Eastern part of Europe on the road toeconomic recovery. The land is rich. Russia was a big foodexporter before the 1917 revolution. Poland, Czechoslovakiaand Hungary, not to mention Ukraine and the Baltic States,could be big producers if modern private farming and fooddistribution were introduced. The abundance would greatlyreduce the enormous amount of time consumers waste just toobtain food. More labor would be freed up to provideservices, which are woefully lacking, and to man newenterprises. Perhaps these countries have learned enough fromthe West to forgo farm subsidies.   As economies become wealthier, the introduction of thatnew wealth to Europe will serve the interests of WestEuropeans, including farmers, far better than holding on toun-economic subsidies and protections. A richer Europe willbe a better market for the U.S. and Japan as well.   Earle H. Harbison Jr., president of Monsanto Co., of St.Louis, wants to promote the reconstruction process. The U.S.government, he believes, should encourage U.S. corporationsto participate. Monsanto, a major producer of agriculturalchemicals, has done business in Russia, Poland,Czechoslovakia and Romania for years, so its people alreadyare familiar with the problems. It currently is conducting ademonstration project in large-scale farming in Ukraine.   Says Mr. Harbison: &quot;We {the U.S. government} don't have anawful lot of money and we don't want to throw money at thembecause we know that does no good when they don't have theinfrastructure and the system. I think what we ought to do iscommission various companies, or even consortia of companies,to tackle given problems. Let us define a problem. Do we wantto increase the growth of wheat in the Soviet Union? Do wewant to increase the manufacture of tires and improve theirquality? Let us pick a series of issues of importance and letus pull together one or more companies -- frankly fewer arebetter than many.   &quot;I don't think the U.S. government just writes a check tothese companies and says, `Fellows, go do it.' I think yousay to the companies, `You define the project, you get therelevant bureaus or companies or businesses in thosecountries, bring us the plan, we'll look at it and say if itmakes relative sense, and we will share in the cost. You take50% of the risk and we'll take 50% of the risk.'   &quot;We would bring American industry, know-how, technology,live people on the spot, management techniques, understandinghow you do things and we would imbed American systems intothese countries, which would be a continuous feed forcontinuing business. I don't think we should just be writingchecks and throwing out money through these internationalorganizations.&quot;   That all sounds pretty sensible. Even if this kind ofsubsidization suffered from government's usual bureaucratictangles, it would not involve a lot of money and it would atleast address the central problem of the East, capitalformation and economic reorganization. Governments andindustry have worked well together on other big projects,space exploration for example. The Easterners themselves wantto work with real capitalists.   There is only one problem -- politics. Politics is on theside of the status quo, subsidies to Western farmers,connections between the U.S. Treasury and the World Bank, theInternational Monetary Fund and Jacques Attali's new EuropeanBank for Reconstruction and Development. Maybe thecorporations will have to go it alone. Maybe if they do, theywill do more good in the East over the long pull than anyoneelse.</TEXT></DOC>
