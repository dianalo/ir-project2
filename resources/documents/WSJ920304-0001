Consumers Power Co.unit said it reached a comprehensive agreement that settlesall its disputes with Michigan utility regulators over its49%-owned Midland Cogeneration Venture.   The agreement, which must gain final approval from theMichigan Public Service Commission, settles all disputes andends all litigation arising from conflicts over the amount ofenergy Consumers Power gets from the venture and the pricesit pays.</LP><TEXT>   According to the agreement, Consumers Power will pay 3.77cents a kilowatt hour to the cogeneration venture forelectric power instead of the 4.15 cents a kilowatt hour thatConsumers Power agreed to pay under an earlier contract.   According to the Association of Businesses AdvocatingTariff Equity, a group also involved in the agreement,Consumers Power will refund $75 million to customers within ayear. That refund will cover the higher rates Consumers Powerusers paid because the utility bought power from thecogeneration venture at higher prices.   The agreement also reduces the total power that ConsumersPower can purchase from the cogeneration venture to 1,053megawatts from 1,240 megawatts. Consumers Power will be ableto purchase the remaining 187 megawatts from the cogenerationventure only if it is the most competitive source.Cogeneration is the process of producing two useful forms ofenergy, usually heat and electricity, from the same fuelsource.   Consumers Power agreed to not seek a rate hike for oneyear. But the agreement allows the utility to receive arevenue increase of as much as $20 million at the end of theyear to reflect changes in its rate base and its equity ratiocaused by debt reduction in 1991 and 1992.</TEXT></DOC>
