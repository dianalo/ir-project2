The Grand Mufti, as he was known, was killed along with 21 otherpeople in Tuesday when the bomb exploded in a densely populatedresidential district of Syrian-policed west Beirut as his car drovepast.   Seventy-five people were wounded and two buildings devastated   Banks, government offices, shops, restaurants, movie theatersand other businesses closed today in all areas, including Israel'sself-proclaimed ``security zone'' in the south, police said. Notrouble was reported.   ``This is the first total shutdown in Lebanon since the civilwar broke out in 1975,'' said a police spokesman, who cannot benamed under standing regulations.   Khaled, 68, was the most senior Sunni cleric in Lebanon, a posthe held for 23 years. His assassination silenced the Moslems' mostprominent advocate of moderation. He had guided his 900,000followers into seeking peaceful coexistence with Lebanon'sChristians to end the 14-year-old civil war.   As is usual with car bombings, there has been no claim ofresponsibility for Tuesday's carnage.   Syria and its leftist militia allies, in separate statements,blamed Khaled's assassination on army commander Gen. Michel Aoun,whose mainly Christian troops have been locked in fierce artilleryand rocket battles with the Syrian forces and their Moslem andDruse allies since March 8.   Aoun, who also heads a Christian government vying for power witha rival Moslem Cabinet, pointed the finger at the Syrians, who hehas branded an occupying force in Lebanon, although he did not namethem.   He described Khaled as ``a great, bold leader'' and expressedthe hope that his slaying would guide the Lebanese to ``take aunified stand against the occupiers of our land.''   Aoun and the Lebanese Front alliance of right-wing Christianpolitical groups ordered a total shutdown today throughout the310-square-mile Christian enclave to mourn the Grand Mufti.   Christian, Moslem and leftist radio stations broadcast sombermusic to mourn Khaled, who is survived by a wife, six sons andthree daughters.   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni who heads thepredominantly Moslem Cabinet, has pledged to follow Khaled'smoderate path.   ``We shall never deviate from the course of moderation ourmartyred Grand Mufti has charted,'' Hoss said in a statementTuesday.   Lebanon has more Shiite Moslems than Sunnis. Shiites loyal toIran are believed to hold most of the 15 foreigners missing inLebanon, who include nine Americans, but Sunnis are not believed tobe involved in hostage-taking.   Seventy-five Moslems wounded in recent fighting left west Beiruttoday in a convoy of ambulances for Damascus, Syria's capital, toboard a plane for Kuwait. They are to be treated in hospitals thereunder a humanitarian program launched by the oil-rich gulf state toaid Moslem and Christian victims of Lebanon's violence.   Kuwait's foreign minister, Sheik Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, headsa six-member Arab League committee seeking to mediate an end to thebloodshed.   A Christian source, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidpreparations were under way to ``guarantee safe exit'' for anunspecified number of wounded Christians to leave for Kuwait.   Police said Syrian and Druse gunners fired two dozen rockets andhowitzer shells at the Christian coastline early today, violating aweek-old cease-fire brokered by the Arab League.   Syria and its allies have declared they will keep shelling theChristian coastline, despite the truce, to prevent Aoun receivingsupplies by sea.   Aoun's gunners did not respond to the violations, which haveblocked the deployment of a 321-man force of military observersfrom Kuwait and five other Arab nations to monitor the cease-fire.</TEXT></DOC>
