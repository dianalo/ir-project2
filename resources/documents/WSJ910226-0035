The new method would use semiconductor lasers as clocks.Researchers said it should take about five years for theselasers to show up as clocks in commercial use.</LP><TEXT>   Current computers use a quartz crystal as their clock. Asit vibrates, electric signals are sent on their way through acomputer. This happens at intervals usually measured innanoseconds, or billionths of a second. But as the signalswend their way through miles of tiny wires on the circuitsinside computers, problems can develop.   The crystal's oscillations aren't always uniform. Somesignals can also get held up as they pass through the wiresand reach their destination a nanosecond or two late. Thatmeans that parts of the computer that are supposed to beaddressing a problem simultaneously are actually out ofsynch. To prevent the problem, called &quot;skew,&quot; engineers mustslow the computer system to give the clock and the wiring amargin for error.   &quot;Clock skew problems are becoming significant, even inmicroprocessors {for use in workstations}, not to mention thesupercomputers that Seymour Cray and others are working on,&quot;said Richard Shaffer, editor of Computer Letter, an industrynewsletter.   Clock speed will become an even bigger issue as designersincreasingly bump up against the ceiling created by the speedof light. A signal must travel hundreds of feet, or evenmiles, through all the wiring inside a computer beforereturning to its origin. Yet most computers require that thecircuit be completed before another signal is dispatched. Andthose circuits can take a lot of nanoseconds, given thatlight travels just a foot in a nanosecond. As designersstruggle to shrink computers, they must also increase thefrequency at which signals are dispatched.   Bellcore, the research arm of the regional Bell operatingcompanies, said its scientists address the problem by using asemiconductor laser as the clock. The laser, the size of agrain of sand, emits a pulse of light every 120 picoseconds,or trillionths of a second. The light can then be split intoas many as 1,024 new laser beams and dispatched throughoptical fibers to coordinate the activities of that number ofcircuit boards.   The laser is extremely accurate and the optical fibers arenearly pure. So, the researchers said, the pulses wouldarrive at circuit boards within 12 picoseconds of each other.That is 1/10th the so-called jitter of the best systems nowavailable.   The Bellcore researchers said previous attempts to usesemiconductor lasers as a clock had failed because it took along time to turn them on and off. They said they solved theproblem by using a &quot;mode-locked&quot; laser, which turns on andoff constantly at precise intervals.</TEXT></DOC>
