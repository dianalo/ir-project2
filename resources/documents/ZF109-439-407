System Sleuth gathersinformation from DOS that is generally correct and reports it inan easily understood form.andP;  Buyers like the program's 'slickness'and say that the fact it does not allow users to edit actuallycontributes to security.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Company:   Dariana Technology Group Inc. (products).andO;Product:   System Sleuth 2.1 (Utility program).andO;Topic:     Utility ProgramsHard DiskDiagnosticsEvaluation.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Dariana Technology Group Inc.andM;The program that created the niche for system-reporting software, SystemSleuth from Dariana Technology Group offers an easy way to examine resourcesinstalled in a PC.andP;  In addition, this latest version of the package (2.1)includes vestigial disk-testing facilities and several utilities.andM;Don't call the sleuth a diagnostician, however.andP;  The only true diagnosticoffered is a routine that checks and verifies bad sectors on the system'shard disks.andM;Otherwise, System Sleuth simply reports what's installed and what's not.andP;  Itallows a detailed look at memory but does not allow editing of RAM or diskmemory.andM;Despite its large size, about 171K plus a 121K-byte help file, System Sleuthloads and reacts quickly to commands.andP;  It's completely menu-driven, colorfuland elegantly laid out, taking advantage of all the text-mode block-graphictricks.andM;After a pause of about two seconds as the program carries out its initialinvestigation, the initial display gives a quick look at the systemconfiguration with a movable magnifying glass to look at memory contents.andM;From there, control advanced to the Main Menu, which allows menu selectionsof disk, memory, video, I/O views, a check of &quot;hardware resources&quot;--basicallymemory usage--report generation and user functions.andP;  Through its user-definedmenu, System Sleuth will also link to other programs and diagnostics,allowing them to be started from within the Sleuth shell.andM;This gathered information is generally correct, although occasionally a bitconfusing, reporting the video compatibilities that are available as separatedisplay adapters, so a system with a single VGA board is also reported ashaving a CGA and EGA as well.andP;  Also disconcerting is System Sleuth's relianceon reading the BIOS data area as its information source.andP;  Consequently, itsreports may vary somewhat from actual hardware.andP;  For example, it reports theCOM3 internal modem of the PC Week Labs test system as a parallel rather thanserial port.andM;On the other hand, the Sleuth reports in easily understood form.andP;  Forexample, the results of the disk-partition analysis are given in Englishrather than hexadecimal formulas.andM;Besides its sleuthing powers, the package includes a number of separateutility programs.andP;  Among these are a expanded memory emulator for 286-basedsystems, a disk cache, a program that saves complementary metal-oxidesemiconductor (CMOS) configuration information to disk and simplefile-management utilities.andM;Overall, System Sleuth works well at its original design purpose, revealingthe contents of a computer without the need to crack the case, although it iscomparatively costly.andM;Dariana Technology Group Inc. can be reached in Buena Park, Calif., at (714)994-7400.andM;Buyers say ...andM;&quot;System Sleuth is slick.andP;  It shows how memory is used, gives information onthe hard disk, tells how memory is broken between extended and expandedmemory and shows where the BIOS is resident,&quot; said Don Kenney, director ofproduct evaluation for Ingram Micro D Inc., a hardware distributor in SantaAna, Calif.andM;&quot;It does not allow a user to edit.andP;  Editing can be dangerous.andP;  This is a safeprogram that everybody can use,&quot; said Kenney.andM;&quot;System Sleuth can instantly look at a machine and see what it has.andP;  For aperson that supports a lot of machines, the product is great,&quot; he added.andM;At Intel Corp. Personal Computer Enhancement Operation in Hillsboro, Ore.,andO;Senior Manager Gene Miller was investigating the latest diagnostics packages.andO;He looked at CheckIt, QAPlus, Control Room as well as System Sleuth.andM;&quot;System Sleuth is not really a diagnostics program.andP;  It looks at aconfiguration in detail.andP;  We use it to dial into a customer's system to findout what they have,&quot; he stated.andM;According to buyers, System Sleuth is unable to detect memory errors.andO;Instead, System Sleuth tells what programs are in memory and where theyreside.andM;&quot;It doesn't show that a chip is bad but rather how the memory is used,&quot; saidKenney.andP;  &quot;It would be nice to have a memory check.andP;  But when you turn themachine on and it works, then you would assume that the memory is working.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
