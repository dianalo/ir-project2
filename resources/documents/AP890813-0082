Police said four traded their captives for an aircraft and pilotto end a three-day standoff with police on a highway near the townof Presidente Prudente, 635 miles southwest of Rio de Janieiro.They were armed with hand grenades, submachine guns, pistols andshotguns.   Police said the hostages were unharmed.   ``I lived for four days with a pistol at my head but not for oneminute did I believe I would die,'' said Monica Calassa, one of thehostages. ``A person who trades her life for that of another can'tdie like that.''   It was not clear where the plane was headed. The fugitives, twomarried couples, earlier had indicated they wanted to be flown toParaguay.   Brazilian media identified the fugitives' leader as Rui Ribeirode Campos and said he owns a farm in Paraguay.   ``The plane departed late this afternoon but is flying at a verylow altitude and we are not able to pick them up on the radar,''policeman Nivaldo de Pirondi said by telephone from PresidentePrudente.   The pilot was Aniceto de Oliveira Gomes, a rancher and mayor ofthe rural town of Pantalina in central Goias state, Pirondi said.He voluntered to fly the hostages to a destination of their choice,Pirondi said.   Police said a sixth man, apparently a friend of Gomes', hadaccompanied the pilot on the flight.   The plane's departure ended a three-day standoff between morethan 100 police and the fugitives, who had led police on a 500-milechase through three states since Wednesday.   On Wednesday, the fugitives were paid a $42,000 ransom and givenan armored car and driver in exchange for a 9-year-old boy thay hadkidnapped on Aug. 3. Three local newswomen offered to take theplace of the young boy, and the kidnappers later released the oneof the reporters.   However, Goias state authorities on Wednesday failed to providea plane for their escape, and the kidnappers began their flight.   The kidnappers stopped only for gasoline and food from aroadside cafeteria. To eat, one kidnapper stepped from the carholding a pistol to a newswoman's head.   Several previous attempts to negotiate the hostages' release hadfailed.</TEXT></DOC>
