Pierce faces adaunting legal and public relations challenge when he appearsTuesday before a House subcommittee investigating his old agency,say lawyers who have helped many witnesses cope withsometimes-hostile congressional inquiries.   Potential pitfalls, even for the most blameless witness, rangefrom bad publicity to a perjury indictment.   ``It's a very difficult forum,'' said Washington lawyer AbbeDavid Lowell. ``There are fewer rules to protect witnesses than ina court or even a grand jury. The power structure is veryone-sided.''   Pierce has been subpoenaed by the House Government Operationssubcommittee to testify about alleged influence-peddling andmismanagement at the Department of Housing and Urban Development,an agency he ran for eight years.   Paul L. Perito, one of Pierce's lawyers, has questioned thesubcommittee's fairness and complained that there is not enoughtime to prepare Pierce to testify.   While not disclosing specific strategies, Perito said, ``Iassure you, I am not going to let my client get kicked around.''   Perito said the House panel ``seems to have made up its mindthat my client was involved in some wrongdoing despite the factthere is not a shred of evidence to support such a finding.''   ``In light of this, I must consider every viable and reasonableprofessional option,'' Perito said.   The Associated Press asked expert lawyers what advice they wouldgive to Pierce. Their advice:   _Listen to the questions and limit any answer to what you knowto be the facts. Do not be afraid of qualifying any answer.   _Anticipate what might be asked, and focus on the facts knownabout those issues.   _Be prepared to tell your story in a clear, concise andconsistent way.   _Be aware of potential criminal charges, and of your right toinvoke the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.   _Be aware of the news media attention your appearance willgenerate.   The subcommittee is expected to question Pierce about his rolein a number of controversial agency decisions to provide fundingfor projects supported by well-connected Republicans.   ``To some degree, it's like preparing for any testimony,'' saidJames Hamilton, a Washington lawyer who 16 years ago served asassistant chief counsel of the Senate committee investigating theWatergate scandal. ``But there are peculiarities of the forum withwhich you must deal.''   Justin Simon, another Washington lawyer who has representedcongressional witnesses, noted that Pierce's legal team already haslaid a foundation for the former Cabinet officer's refusal tocooperate with the House panel.   ``Only in rare circumstances would it be advisable for anindividual who has potential criminal exposure to testify,'' hesaid.   ``By maintaining that Congress is not allowing enough time todetermine whether their client has a criminal problem, it becomesvery reasonable for a witness to rely on his Fifth Amendment righteven if convinced he did nothing wrong,'' Simon said.   If Pierce invokes his right not to answer the panel's questions,Simon added, ``He has to bite the bullet and take the adversepublicity. It may raise the specter, although in theory it shouldnot, that the guy has something to hide.''   Late Friday, Pierce exercised his right under House rules forany subpoenaed witness to have all news media cameras andmicrophones banned from the hearing room. Simon said that if hewere advising Pierce, he, too, would have advocated that move.   Another option is testifying in executive session, with thepublic excluded, but that tack is subject to the subcommittee'sdiscretion.   ``It's important for a witness' lawyer to know the rules of theparticular committee,'' said Hamilton. ``For example, can thewitness make an opening statement?''   Lowell said the paucity of ground rules forces a witness' lawyerto be more aggressive.   Attorneys like Brendan Sullivan, who was often combative whenrepresenting Oliver North during testimony before a congressionalcommittee about the Iran-Contra affair, ``often have to depend onthe strength of their will to protect their clients,'' Lowell said.   Simon agreed, noting that in Congress, unlike in court, ``thereare very few restrictions on what are viewed as relevant questions_ almost anything is relevant in this forum.''   The experts said Pierce, if he chooses to testify, faces athorny problem _ the threat of being accused of perjury _ if hismemory fails him or he falls into what Simon called the common trapof ``remembering things in a way that reflects favorably on you.''   ``And if his testimony disagrees with that of another witness,it's a matter of who is believed,'' Simon said.</TEXT></DOC>
