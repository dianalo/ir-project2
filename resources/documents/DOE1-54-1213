The power absorption(Joule loss) of the powder specimen, calculated from the data of thevoltage standing-wave ratio (VSWR), changes markedly at the transitiontemperature, and decreases with decreasing temperature in the superconductingstate. In a lower temperature region, it tends to the formula A = 17.6exp (-0.031 eV/kT). Microwaves were found to penetrate considerably intothe superconducting specimen.</TEXT></DOC>
