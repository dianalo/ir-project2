Northern Ireland Industry Minister Peter Viggers said he was &quot;actively&quot; seeking the return to the private sector of the company, which is the province's biggest employer with a work force of 7,600.    Although the government wants to sell the company as a whole, Mr. Viggers disclosed that ministers wouldn't rule out the sale of divisions to separate interests.    The statement follows the government's announcement last week that it was privatizing the electricity industry in Northern Ireland and the disclosure several months ago that the government was hoping to sell the state-owned Belfast shipyard, the province's second-biggest employer. </TEXT></DOC>
