He's no cop, but hedoes take over from Tyne Daly when his new CBS show, ``AlmostGrown,'' moves into the old ``Cagney andamp; Lacey'' time period next week.   The one-hour series, which has a special two-hour preview Sunday,is an ambitious, multiera drama about one couple, seen asteen-agers, as college students and as divorced adults. The plan isthat each episode will begin in the present, then flash back to oneof the other eras.   ``I've been offered a lot of television, and I'm thankful forthat. I shouldn't sound snotty about it, and I don't mean to be,''Daly, 32, said in an interview. ``It's just that there's a lot ofstuff on TV that people were interested in having me do that to mewas not acting.   ``I really wanted to do something unique, because how many guyson television have pointed a gun and said, `Freeze!' It's like thereare 85 guys on TV saying `Freeze' any night of the week. I don'twant to do that. Of course, my sister did it, too. She pointed a gunand said `Freeze,' but she was a woman, that was the difference.''   Timothy Daly starred in the 1982 sleeper hit film ``Diner'' buthas done his proudest work on the stage, most recently in ``CoastalDisturbances'' off Broadway.   In 1983, he co-starred in the short-lived TV medical drama``Ryan's Four.'' This time, he may have a winner. ``Almost Grown''is one of the better offerings among the meager selection of goodnew shows this season.   Although different in style and premise, ``Almost Grown'' soundslike the CBS answer to ABC's appeal to baby boomers,``thirtysomething.'' The comparison bugs Daly.   ``I think it's a good and ambitious show, but the only similarityI can see (with `thirtysomething') is that it's intelligenttelevision,'' he said.   ``I don't think it's a `baby-boomer' show. I think this show canappeal to anyone who likes rock 'n' roll, which is ages like 10 to50, so that's quite a wide range.''   The show plays to the fact that a lot of Americans have now grownup with rock music, and their passion for it can turn a golden oldieinto a painfully evocative memory.   Daly plays Norman Foley. Eve Gordon plays girlfriend-wife-ex-wifeSuzie.   The pilot flashes back to their meeting in high school, when Normis a goody-goody and Suzie is running around with the local hood.   By 1971, they are living together off campus. He's a deejay onthe university radio station, she aspires to be a documentaryfilmmaker. They consider marriage only after Norm's appalled parentsoffer to buy them a car if they will tie the knot.   By the 1980s, Norm and Suzie have two children and a divorce.Suzie, a technical filmmaker for a medical lab, is about to marry anirritatingly well-adjusted cosmetic surgeon who donates his skillsto penniless victims of disasters. At the wedding, Norm suddenly andwithout provocation hauls off and belts the groom. Then ensues atypical real-life fight between two guys who don't know what theyare doing and are hoping not to hurt each other. The flash of fistsquickly dissolves into a flood of apologies.   ``I think the reason the characters are likable is becausethey're flawed,'' said Daly. ``They're just struggling along likethe rest of us. They're not holding themselves up as anything,they're just trying to get through. They have these emotionalresponses to things that get them in trouble.   ``I look forward to seeing if we can make some good TV shows,''Daly said. ``If we can't, I hope it dies a quick and painless death,but if we can, I can see doing it for a while.''</TEXT><TEXT>   Elsewhere in television:   THE CENTAUR ATE MY HOMEWORK _ PBS viewers will be able to getcollege credit next fall by watching public television's ``JosephCampbell: Transformations of Myth Through Time,'' a series of filmedlectures, part of PBS' telecourse program in conjunction with anumber of colleges and universities around the country.
