Along with the mayoral race and city financing questions,voters were asked to decide one more thing: whether the cityshould support the First Amendment.</LP><TEXT>   Fortunately for newspapers, artists and those who like totalk out loud, Proposition O (&quot;Shall it be the policy of thepeople of San Francisco to affirm the City's unqualifiedsupport for the First Amendment right to freedom ofexpression?&quot;) received 119,115 ayes to 44,936 nays.   John Whisman, co-chairman of the group that gathered11,500 signatures to put the issue on the ballot, says the&quot;Supreme Court made the First Amendment a local issue&quot; whenit said obscenity can be defined by &quot;community standards.&quot;With recent criticism of certain artists, he says SanFrancisco needed to declare that &quot;we stand behind the FirstAmendment absolutely as written.&quot; In a paid ad in the voterhandbook, Mayor Art Agnos urged the city &quot;to send Jesse Helmsa message that the First Amendment is alive and well in1991.&quot; Grassroots, another supporting group, wrote, &quot;We havethe right to take part in orgies -- but not videotape them]&quot;   San Francisco has a history of registering its opinions onnational and international issues during local elections. In1987, voters passed resolutions making the city anuclear-free zone and opposing apartheid. And in 1988, SanFrancisco voters defeated a measure calling for the mutualrecognition of Palestine and Israel.   But even the American Civil Liberties Union of NorthernCalifornia found the First Amendment question &quot;redundant atbest,&quot; says Director Dorothy Ehrlich. Although the group saysmore education about the importance of the First Amendment isneeded, &quot;we believe that fundamental rights don't need to bevoted on by the people at this time.&quot;   Mr. Whisman says the no votes reflected a&quot;misunderstanding&quot; that the proposal wasn't necessary, andthe &quot;flat-out willingness of some people to compromise theprinciples of free speech.&quot; Political-science Prof. GeorgeWayne Bradley, of San Francisco State University, says&quot;There's an untapped reservoir of paranoia out there thatyou'd be amazed at.&quot; Many opposed the measure itself. &quot;It'sabsurd,&quot; says lawyer Thomas Panelli, who voted no. &quot;Why nothave a referendum on whether motherhood is good, or whetherto support the daily rising of the sun?&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
