He stops in the cold wind to boast of his war exploits in the Caucasus and Eastern Europe, pointing near his fluffy white whiskers to show where he was shot in the cheek by a retreating German soldier.    When the conversation shifts from the past to the present, however, his patriotic fervor seems to waver a little. &quot;I know a young man, Volodya, who fought in Afghanistan,&quot; he says quietly. &quot;He was shot. Only just stayed alive.&quot; He pauses a moment, then adds, &quot;People don't need wars.&quot;    Yesterday was Victory Day in the Soviet Union, an annual national holiday to celebrate the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945. Television showed historic films and newsreels from early morning on, and newspapers published a declaration by Defense Minister Dmitry Yazov praising the &quot;immortal feats&quot; of the Soviet armed forces. Veterans from across the country gathered for open-air reunions in parks and squares all over town. Shivering brass bands played military marches, and people lined up at stalls to buy Ukrainian pretzels and souvenir badges.    But despite the festive atmosphere, the bright memories of wartime days almost half a century ago were clouded for some veterans by the realities now being aired in public for the first time.    Under Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of greater openness, or &quot;glasnost,&quot; people here are being confronted by unexpectedly critical details both about the war in Afghanistan and even about World War II -- long viewed unequivocally as a stunning victory for Soviet fortitude and sacrifice.    The media have shown the sufferings of the Red army caught in the seemingly futile struggle in neighboring Afghanistan, and have talked about the difficulties of soldiers readjusting to life back home. The Soviet leadership calls its decision to withdraw troops starting Sunday a victory for Mr. Gorbachev's &quot;new political thinking.&quot; But some Russians count the cost in lives, and openly wonder.    &quot;They showed the same heroism as we did,&quot; says Viktor Feodorovich. A former army commander with a white goatee, he is holding a big map showing the route of his troops from Sverdlovsk in the Urals to Prague. &quot;There are no differences between the Afghanistan veterans and us. Why should they have trouble finding housing and sympathy here?&quot;    Just as troubling for many veterans is the current revision of the official Soviet history of World War II. Joseph Stalin, once feted for leading the country to victory in the war, is now out of favor and being blamed for mistakes that cost lives. The official press has run articles in recent months saying that Russia was ill-prepared for the Nazi invasion in June 1941 because Stalin had purged most of his officers and ignored all warnings of an imminent attack.    The articles seem partly aimed at discrediting Mr. Gorbachev's political opponents, who have invoked memories of Stalin when criticizing the leadership's current reforms. But for former soldiers who went to fight with the slogan &quot;for the motherland and for Stalin,&quot; the disclosures can be unsettling.    &quot;I'm not happy. Why stir up the past?&quot; complains Vasily Mikhailovich, a 70-year-old who commanded an artillery battery in Belorussia. &quot;All leaders make mistakes, even the ones after Stalin made mistakes.&quot;    Alexandra Leontivna agrees. She joined the navy as a 17-year-old and was sent to Sevastapol in the Crimea. &quot;I'm a Stalinist and all my friends are Stalinists,&quot; she says, flashing her gold-capped teeth as she thanks a little girl who hands her a bunch of daffodils. &quot;People went to war for him,&quot; she says coldly. &quot;I think glasnost is bad when they attack Stalin.&quot;    Concerned about causing a backlash, some have tried to qualify the blame. In an article in Izvestia last week, Chingiz Aitmatov, a Kirghiz author, wrote that &quot;criticism of Stalin doesn't belittle or delete the victory as such. The victory is everybody's affair.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
