Rev. George A. Stallings Jr., 41, will say Mass and performsacraments despite his suspension by the Roman Catholic Archdioceseof Washington, a spokesman for Stallings said.   ``In the eyes of the Catholic Church it's without the consent ofthe archbishop, but it's within the cultural needs of theindividuals who would want to worship here,'' Stallings spokesmanHayden Blanc said in an interview Saturday.   ``It is the intention of the congregation to stay within theCatholic Church,'' Blanc said. The services of the Imani Temple,named after the Swahili word for faith, will be held in a suburbanWashington high school auditorium.   But as in a service last week that drew an estimated 3,000 peopleto the grounds of Howard University, Stallings will include Africanreligious rites and add readings from black authors to the standardscripture and sacraments, Blanc said.   Stallings has said the new congregation is necessary because theCatholic Church has failed ``cultural and spiritual needs'' of itsblack parishioners. Stallings has also charged the church withracism.   He has said he wants to see formation of an African-AmericanCatholic Rite, which would still recognize the authority of the popebut have more control over its liturgy and other matters.   The church is not contemplating any further discipline for now, aspokesman for the Washington Archdiocese said.   ``He is a suspended priest ... The church is not going to standbehind anything he does sacramentally,'' said Rev. William Lori,secretary to Washington Cardinal James A. Hickey. ``Obviously, asuspended priest is not supposed to say Mass in public or inprivate.''   Hickey suspended Stallings last week, after the service atHoward. The church has since adopted a ``wait and see'' response,Lori said.   ``We're not going to be rushed into anything, and we're askinghim to reconcile,'' he said.   Lori said there are no meetings between Stallings and churchofficials scheduled. He has said there are no plans to excommunicateStallings now.   ``Obviously Imani Temple is just an infant. ... We're not goingto rush into any kind of rash judgement, and we don't regard whatFather Stallings says as the final word,'' Lori said.   Stallings has said he ``cannot be excommunicated from God,'' evenif the church moves to strip him of his ordination.   Lori said the church ``cannot guarantee'' Mass and communionobserved at Imani Temple would be recognized elsewhere in theCatholic Church. But he said there will be no church action againstpracticing Catholics who attend Stallings' services. ``One serviceat Imani Temple does not erase a lifetime of Catholicism,'' Lorisaid.   Stallings spokesman Blanc said he expected more than 1,000 peopleat the 11 a.m. service Sunday. He said response to the new chuchfrom black Catholics has been positive.   ``From the papers you would think there has been so muchopposition, there really isn't. As far as the phones are concerned,once in a blue moon we may get someone who has a question,'' Blancsaid.   Priests from many of the area's 40 predominately black parisheshave issued statements supporting Hickey and the church.   Lori said many of those churches offer so-called gospel Masses,like those Stallings delivered during 12 years as pastor of a blackchurch here.   ``The church has said racism is a sin. ... Father Stallings isnot the first one to make that charge and he's not making it to achurch that isn't listening,'' Hickey spokesman Lori said.   ``The church is not upset at Father Stallings because he pointsout the need for better ministry to black Catholics ... The problemis that he is going about it in the wrong way,'' Lori said.</TEXT></DOC>
