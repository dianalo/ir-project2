Mr. Mazowiecki, a Roman Catholic thinker and a leader of the Solidarity trade-union movement, was moved into office by a vote of 378-4, with 41 abstentions. He thus received more than 130 votes from Communist Party members.    In a brief and moving acceptance speech, Mr. Mazowiecki pledged to be the &quot;prime minister of all Poles&quot; and said he would assemble a coalition government representing all factions in the Sejm, including the Communists.    He declined, during his speech and later at a news conference, to give details of his new government, saying he was just starting to work on it but hoped to complete it by the end of the month. The Communists will certainly retain control of the Interior and Defense ministries, and thus the police and the army, as well as getting one or two other key posts. But Solidarity is likely to reserve for itself control of the judicial system and has pledged to open up the state-run mass media to dissenting voices.    &quot;Deep reform can only come from a government acting on behalf of all political forces in the country,&quot; he added, a reference to possible obstruction of the new government by Communist Party members in Parliament and in millions of local-government and state-industry jobs all over Poland. He appealed for the Communists and everyone else to &quot;make it normal&quot; for governments of different hues to come in and out of power, and said &quot;constant political struggle must give way to partnership.&quot;    Mr. Mazowiecki outlined few specfics of his new government's program. He said his economic philosophy was that &quot;the State can't guarantee everything, it can only make it easier for economic actors to act.&quot; He called Poland's economic situation &quot;critical&quot; and said his long-term strategy would be to &quot;bring back the long-proven institution of the market.&quot; He said, &quot;We are moving back to a market economy where the role of the state is more like that in developed countries.&quot;    The government's first priority, he added, would be to try to tackle Poland's inflation, estimated at an annual rate of more than 100%. He said the lack of &quot;balance&quot; that causes such inflation &quot;increases social tensions,&quot; a reference to chronic strikes for higher wages to keep up with galloping prices. But he didn't indicate how he would fight inflation. He asked all workers to end their strikes to give the government a chance.    &quot;He's got to show real progress on bringing prices down and getting more goods in the shops,&quot; said a European diplomat who listened to the speech. &quot;They've got a couple of months to prove things are changing. Otherwise people will come back from their vacations broke, find prices skyrocketing and increase their pay demands. Sooner or later Mazowiecki will have to quit, and then Poland is in a real mess.&quot;    Although Mr. Mazowiecki and other Solidarity leaders, including Lech Walesa, who is the chairman of the union, have appealed for economic aid from both West and East, the new prime minister said: &quot;Poland's economic problems will be solved by Poles. Our own inventiveness and patience will determine whether we succeed.&quot; But he added: &quot;The world is watching the changes here with much hope.&quot; Foreign countries should send whatever help they can soon, he said, to help Poland succeed, &quot;rather than waiting for Poland to sink.&quot; Solidarity has asked for $10 billion in Western aid and loan forgiveness.    Mr. Mazowiecki reiterated previous statements that his government would stay firmly in the Warsaw Pact military alliance and the Soviet-led Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, or Comecon, an economic grouping that includes most of Eastern Europe plus Soviet allies Cuba, Vietnam and Mongolia.    &quot;The real question is, can things get better?&quot; the new prime minister said. &quot;We will all answer this together. Poland will be different if everybody here wants it to be.&quot;    Mr. Mazowiecki's speech got a warm reception from the Solidarity benches, a polite reception from two of its coalition partners, the Peasants' and Democratic parties, and a frosty reception from the Communists. Party parliamentary chief Marian Orzechowski, who abstained in the vote, said he wanted to hear more specifics of Mr. Mazowiecki's program and government before he lends his full backing. &quot;If he keeps his promises on letting us participate, then I'll vote with the government the next time,&quot; he said.    Political analysts here said that the role of the Communists remains crucial to the success of the new regime and that they could probably torpedo Mr. Mazowiecki if they wanted to by withholding their support. But because Communist-led regimes have failed repeatedly this year to win public backing, they might face harsh political consequences.    At his news conference, Mr. Mazowiecki, a devout Catholic, said he intended to maintain the separation of church and state, because he didn't want to &quot;replace one 'one-outlook' government with another.&quot; He said that while he personally opposed abortion, he wouldn't favor recriminalization of it here, adding that &quot;education is a better method than law to fight abortion.&quot;    The new prime minister then left the news conference in a welter of TV cameras and hopped into a bright-blue Polish limousine for a meeting with his political mentor, Mr. Walesa. After that, he said, he was going to call his spiritual mentor: Pope John Paul II.
