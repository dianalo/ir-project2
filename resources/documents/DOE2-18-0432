There is little literature on the thoracicradiography and pathology of this condition. The author examined chestmanifestations in 22 cases. The main pathologic finding was infiltrationof small bronchial walls and lymph nodes (often without enlargement)by atypical histiocytes. Septal edema and pleural effusion were common.Radiographic findings in six cases included interstitial pattern in five,lymphadenopathy in three, and pleural effusion in three. Abnormalitieswere usually unilateral, but bilateral in severe cases. Despite theirnonspecificity, these findings in the appropriate clinical setting shouldsuggest the possibility of malignant histiocytosis.</TEXT></DOC>
