Regulation 33.4(a)(2) requires that whena commodity option is purchased each clearing member must pay to its clearinghouse, each member must pay to its clearing member, and each option customermust pay to his futures commission merchant (``FCM''), the full optionpremium.\1\<NOTE/> The Exchanges have asked the Commission to delete this regulationin order to permit the development of ``futures-style margining'' of commodityoptions.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Regulation 33.4 states:<ITAG tagnum="28">andSection; 33.4 Designation as a contract market for the trading ofcommodity options.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">The Commission may designate any board of trade . . . as a contractmarket for the trading of options . . . when the applicant complies withand carries out the requirements of the Act (as provided in andSection; 33.2),these regulations, and the following conditions and requirements with respectto the commodity option for which the designation is sought:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(a) Such board of trade * * *.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(2) Provides that the clearing organization must receive from eachof its clearing members, that each clearing member must receive from eachother person for whom it clears commodity option transactions, and thateach futures commission merchant must receive from each of its option customers,the full amount of each option premium at the time the option is purchased.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Implementation of futures-style margining also might requirethe amendment of other Commission regulations or interpretations. <T3>See e.g.</T3> Financial and Segregation Interpretation No. 8_ProperAccounting, Segregation and Net Capital Treatment of Exchange-Traded OptionTransactions, Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH), andpara;7118 (August 12, 1982).A futures-style margining system for options would include two components:original margin, set according to the underlying risk, and variation margin,reflecting the daily change in the value of the premium. Long and shortoption positions would be marked to market and gains and losses paid andcollected daily. The Exchanges contend that futures-style margining wouldimprove cash flow in futures and options markets generally, thereby increasingliquidity and efficiency.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background</ITAG>A. Option Pilot ProgramIn 1981, the Commission instituted a pilot program for exchange-tradedoptions on non-agricultural futures contracts. 46 FR 54500 (November 3,1981). Concurrently, the Commission adopted Part 33 of its regulations,including the full-payment-of-premium requirement of Regulation 33.4(a)(2).In explaining its determination to prohibit the margining of option premiums,the Commission noted that:<ITAG tagnum="21">A critical distinction between options and futures contracts traditionallyhas been that, with respect to options, the one-time payment of a premiumgives the option purchaser the right, over a fixed period of time, to electthe exercise of the option without incurring any additional obligationson this option contract. In contrast, the purchaser's initial payment ofmargin on a futures contract is recognized as the deposit of earnest moneyto insure performance of the contract, but does not represent the fullextent of the purchaser's potential liability on the futures contract.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">46 FR 54504.The Commission's decision to prohibit the margining of option premiumswas ``intended to preserve this critical distinction.'' <T3>Id.</T3> Further, the Commission viewed the requirement as ``essentialto the protection of option purchasers who otherwise could reasonably expectthat an initial payment of margin on an option contract constituted thefull extent of their obligation on the option.'' <T3>Id.</T3> Finally, the Commission stated that ``the rule removes a potentiallysignificant impediment to the financial stability of FCMs, clearing membersand the clearing organizations and also facilitates the monitoring, bythe exchanges, of their members' financial condition.'' <T3>Id.</T3>B. Other DevelopmentsAlthough Regulation 33.4(a)(2) has remained unchanged throughout the pilotand permanent phases of the option program,\3\<NOTE/> market participants have continued to discuss the conceptof futures-style margining of options. As early as June of 1982, the Coffee,Sugar andamp; Cocoa Exchange, Inc. (``CSC'') petitioned the Commission todelete Regulation 33.4(a)(2). The Commission denied CSC's petition, butresolved to reconsider margining of option premiums ``after the Commissionand the industry ha[d] gained some experience with the trading of optionsunder the pilot program.''\4\<NOTE/> The following year, in a March 13, 1983 <T4>Federal Register</T4> release, the Commission solicited comments concerning``[t]he advantages and disadvantages of permitting margining of optionpremiums paid by floor traders.'' 48 FR 10857, 10858 (March 13, 1983).After considering comments made in response to that <T4>Federal Register</T4> release, the Commission published a ``Noticeof proposed rulemaking'' in which it proposed to allow contract marketsto adopt rules permitting their members to make a deposit with respectto the option premium. 49 FR 8937 (March 9, 1984). However, the interveningcircumstance of the 1985 Volume Investors margin default in the gold futuresoption market on the Commodity Exchange, Inc., raised concerns about optionmargining which caused the Commission to delay further consideration offutures-style margining.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Over the years, the pilot program was expanded to optionson non-agricultural physicals and options on agricultural futures, andby February 9, 1987, was permanent for all these option products. Optiontrading on non-agricultural futures was made permanent effective August1, 1986. 51 FR 17464 (May 13, 1986); 51 FR 27529 (August 1, 1986). Optionson agricultural futures and options on non-agricultural physicals weremade permanent effective February 9, 1987. 52 FR 777 (January 9, 1987).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Letter from Jane K. Stuckey, Secretary of the Commission,to Bennett J. Corn, President of CSC, dated July 2, 1982.More recently, in the wake of the October, 1987 market break, the WorkingGroup on Financial Markets recommended in its <T3>Interim Report</T3> that market participants and regulators study thepotential for improving liquidity through the use of futures-style marginingof options.\5\<NOTE/> The Working Group noted the ``particular promise'' of ``cross-margining* * * [c]oupled with futures-style margining.''\6\<NOTE/> In light of the Working Group's recommendations and the ChicagoExchanges' recent petitions, the Commission now is seeking public commenton issues related to futures-style margining of options.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ <T3>Interim Report of The Working Group on Financial Markets,</T3> Submittedto the President of the United States, May 1988.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ <T3>Interim Report,</T3> p. 8. The Commission approved the IntermarketClearing Corporation's proposal for cross-margining of proprietary accountson June 1, 1988. The Securities and Exchange Commission approved the corrspondingproposal of the Options Clearing Corporation on October 7, 1988. The proposal,however, has not been implemented to date.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Comparison of Option Margining Systems</ITAG>Under the current ``stock-style'' option system the option buyer or ``long''must pay the entire premium when the transaction is initiated. No furtherpayments are required. The premium is credited to the account of the optionseller or ``short,'' who must keep it posted as margin. The option selleralso must put up risk margin to cover potential adverse market moves inhis obligation. If the option increases in value, the short must depositadditional funds into the account. These funds, however are not transferredto the long, who must exercise or offset the option in order to realizeany increase in its value. By contrast, if the option value decreases,the short may withdraw any excess funds from its account.Under the proposed ``futures-style'' margin system, both the long and theshort position holders would post risk-based original margin upon enteringinto their option positions. During the life of the option, the optionvalue would be marked to market daily. Any increase in value would resultin a credit to the long option holder's account and a corresponding debitagainst the short's account. Conversely, any decrease in value would resultin a credit to the short's account and a corresponding debit to the long'saccount. Thus the cash flows in option contracts would be symmetric withthose in futures contracts. The change in the margin system, however, wouldnot alter the fundamental nature of each party's overall obligation. Theshort's potential for loss would remain essentially unlimited while thelong would never pay more than the value of the original option premium.The differences between the current stock-style margin system and the proposedfutures-style margin system are illustrated by the following examples.In each case assume that an at-the-money call with an exercise price of270 and sixty days to expiration is purchased for a premium of $5,000.Further assume that the minimum price tick in both the futures and theoption is $500.<T3>Example 1: Option Value Decreases.</T3> At expiration the futures pricehas fallen below the exercise price and the option expires out-of-the-money.Under both stock-style and futures-style margining, the long's loss islimited to the initial premium. Only the timing of the payments differs.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Stock-Style Margining </T4><H1>Long </H1><H1>Short</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Day 1_Pays full premium of $5,000 <D>Day 1_Posts full premium received from long plus initial margin. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Day 2-59_Pays no additional funds <D>Day 2-59_May withdraw amount equal to decrease in value of option positionsince day of purchase. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Day 60_Option expires valueless.

The option is ``in the money''by 15 points and the premium is $7,500 ($500 x 15 points) per contract.Under both systems, the long's profits are the same. Again, only the timingof the payments differs. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,r50 </C><T4>Stock-Style Margining </T4><H1>Long </H1><H1>Short</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Day 1_Pays full premium of $5,000 <D>Day 1_Posts full premium received from long plus initial margin. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Day 2-59_Collects nothing over life of option <D>Day 2-59_Posts additional funds equal to the increase in value of optionposition over the life of the option. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Day 60_Liquidates position by selling the option for $7,500 for a gainof $2,500. <D>Day 60_Liquidates position by buying the option for $7,500 for a lossof $2,500.

Exercisinga futures-style option is analogous to taking delivery on a futures position.In order to receive a cash commodity by taking delivery on a futures contract,the long must pay the settlement price of the futures contract prevailingat the time of delivery. Similarly, in order to obtain a futures positionby exercising an option, the long must pay the settlement price of theoption prevailing at the time of exercise. In other words, the long mustpay the full premium marked to market on the day of exercise. Under a futures-stylemargining system, this payment is offset by the variation pays receivedby the long during the life of the option. The differences between thisprocedure and the exercise of stock-style options are demonstrated in afinal example. <T3>Example 3: Exercise of In-the-money Option. </T3>As in Example 2, thefutures price has risen to 285 by September. The long option holder decidesto exercise the call. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,r50 </C><T4>Stock-Style Margining </T4><H1>Long </H1><H1>Short</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Exercises option. <D>Option is exercised. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Receives long futures position at strike price of 270.

Potential Advantages of Futures-Style Margining </ITAG>The Exchanges foresee a number of benefits arising from futures-style marginingof options. The primary benefits identified would be the potential formore efficient cash flows across markets and a resulting decrease in thepotential for defaults occurring as the result of the inability to securethird-party financing for long futures based on long option values. In this connection the Exchanges point out that, at present, certain spreador risk neutral positions can give rise to substantial funds requirementsdue to asymmetrical cash flows. The problem arises, for example, wherea short futures position is hedged with a long call option. If the shortprice of the futures position increases, the value of the call also increases.However, the trader cannot apply the increased option value toward thecorresponding loss in the futures position.\7\<NOTE/> Instead, the trader must put up funds to pay the futuresvariation requirement. Similar cash flow shortages can arise for tradersholding arbitrage positions such as conversions, reverse conversions, andbox spreads. The Exchanges state that such problems may be particularlyacute when there are major market moves. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\Of course, the trader may obtain the excess funds by exercisingor offsetting the option, but this would eliminate the hedge strategy orrequire re-establishing the option with the ensuing transactions costs.With futures-style margining of options, these asymmetrical cash flowscould be eliminated or reduced. Each increase in an option position's value(long or short) would result in a related variation payment which wouldbe accessible to the option trader. The trader could in turn put his optiongains toward margin payments on other positions with corresponding losses.The Exchanges also state that market liquidity would increase under a futures-stylemargining system because the incentive for early exercise of options wouldbe reduced. Under the present system, an option purchaser can realize increasesin the value of an option only by offsetting or exercising that option.Thus, some long option holders may choose to exercise their options earlyin order to obtain the option profits. This possibility of early exerciseacts as a disincentive to writing options due to the uncertainty it creates.The daily pay and collect feature of the futures-style system would eliminatethe incentive for early exercise. The Exchanges assert that futures-style margining also may reduce financingrequirements for market participants. Under the present margining system,FCMs are exposed to financing risk because long option equity cannot beused to make variation margin payments on short option or futures positions.Moreover, financing based on option equity may not be readily availableto market participants because many banks are reluctant to provide suchfinancing due to option volatility and the uncertain legal status of optionsas collateral. Futures-style options, with their variation pay and collectfeature, would reduce the need for market participants to borrow againsttheir long option equity. Thus, FCMs no longer would be exposed to a creditrisk beyond their control. Some operational efficiency may also be gained through the adoption offutures-style margining of options. Once such a system were in place forall option contracts on a contract market, the exchange would be able tomaintain one basic margining system, for option and futures contracts.Exchange members would benefit in the same manner. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Potential Concerns Raised By Futures-Style Margining </ITAG>One area of concern with respect to futures-style margining would be theincrease in leverage which would accompany it. A long would be requiredto put up a smaller initial payment to purchase a given option than hewould under the current system. This could introduce the risk of defaultin instances where long positions are not paid in full.\8\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\Of course, FCMs would remain free to require an initialpayment equal to the value of the option premium. In any event, under afutures-style margining system, FCMs could be expected to apply the samestandards of creditworthiness to option customers that they apply to futurescustomers. Another issue is the extent to which customers will understand the scopeof their liability. When the option pilot program was instituted in 1981,the Commission cited customer (and trader) confusion over futures-stylemargining as the primary reason for requiring full payment of option premiums.The full premium requirement was viewed by the Commission ``as essentialto the protection of option customers who otherwise could reasonably expectthat an initial payment of margin on an option contract constituted thefull extent of their obligation on the option.'' 46 FR 54504. The Commission's early concern over customer confusion may retain somevalidity today, particularly because full payment of premiums on commodityoptions has been required for a number of years. The Exchanges acknowledgethat the institution of futures-style margining would require major exchangeefforts to educate market participants. Of course, full and accurate disclosureof potential liability also would be necessary at the time an option positionwas entered in order to ensure investor protection.\9\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\Both the Commission and the NFA have alleged that in someinstances options have been marketed to the public through fraudulent misrepresentationsof risk. These cases often involve assertions by options salespersons that,because the full option premium is paid up front, options are risk-freeinvestments. Any adoption of futures-style margining could create additionalor different concerns about fraudulent marketing techniques. A perhaps more significant source of confusion could be the differencesin option pricing which could result from futures-style margining. Optionpremiums potentially would be higher under a futures-style system becauseshorts would demand a higher price to compensate for the loss of interestincome on the full premium and longs would be willing to pay a higher pricebecause they would be gaining such interest income. To the extent a uniformsystem of margining is not in place, market participants would have tobe made aware of the effects of margining systems on pricing. For example,identical options on the same commodity traded at different exchanges mighthave significantly different premiums if one exchange used futures-stylemargining and the other did not. Moreover, this pricing inconsistency alsocould affect various strategies, for example, potentially negating theusefulness of certain ``buy-write'' strategies. In this connection, the Commission believes based on past experience withmargining proposals that there could be substantial costs to the industryin making a transition to futures-style margining. It is unlikely thatall exchanges would be ready (or willing) to switch from stock-style optionmargining to futures-style option margining at the same time. Thus FCMstrading on more than one exchange might incur significant operational costsin order to maintain multiple option margining systems and to comply withdifferent disclosure requirements for different exchanges. Customers couldfind themselves subject to multiple requirements as well. This piecemealchange could be avoided by instituting futures-style margining across-the-boardafter all exchanges had adopted futures-style margin rules, but such anapproach might delay implementation of the system for an indefinite periodof time. Moreover, even if all exchanges introduced futures-style margining simultaneouslythere would be a necessary transition period during which exchanges andmarket participants would be required to deal with both stock-style andfutures-style margining systems. Because of the impact of futures-stylemargining on option pricing, only a newly-issued option series could bemargined in the proposed manner. Any previously-issued option series wouldrequire margining under the existing stock-style system. Thus a changeto futures-style margining would necessitate the maintenance of a two-tieredmargining system for a period of time. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Request for Comments </ITAG>The Commission invites interested persons to comment on the foregoing aswell as any additional issues concerning futures-style margining. In particular,the Commission encourages commenters to address the following issues: 1. The nature and extent of potential benefits resulting from futures-stylemargining to (a) clearing organizations, (b) FCMs, (c) floor traders, and(d) customers. 2. The nature and extent of potential risks created by futures-style marginingto (a) clearing organizations, (b) FCMs, (c) floor traders, and (d) customers.3. The nature and extent to which customer protection issues, includingpotential fraudulent marketing, would arise under the proposal and suggestedmeans of addressing those issues, such as enhancing risk disclosure requirements.4. The nature and extent to which operational difficulties would arisefrom implementation of futures-style margining and suggested ways to minimizesuch difficulties. 5. Whether the implementation of futures-style margining would necessitatethe creation or enhancement of other safeguards such as additional assessmentsfor market participants carrying large positions concentrated in particularcontracts. 6. Whether futures-style margining would affect market liquidity by changingthe identity of market participants. 7. Whether the benefits and risks of futures-style margining would be anydifferent under gross margin and net margin systems. 8. Whether the benefits and risks of futures-style margining would be differentdepending on the nature of the underlying commodity, <T3>e.g.,</T3> physical commodities as contrasted to stock indices. 9. Whether the potential that some options traded on futures markets mightbe futures-style while others would be stock-style would create significantproblems and what those problems would be. 10. Whether the proposed dichotomy between futures-style options tradedon futures markets and stock-style options traded on securities marketswould create significant problems and what those problems would be. 11. Whether the proposed deletion of Regulation 33.4(a)(2) and the proposedimplementation of futures-style margining would necessitate additionalchanges to the Commission's regulations. 12. Whether there are alternative means of obtaining the benefits of futures-stylemargining. For example, could symmetrical cash flows be achieved whilerequiring full payment of the premium? Or, could the asserted benefitsbe achieved while limiting futures-style margining to certain classes oftraders (e.g., institutions)?
