So say benefit experts studying employer medical-insurance bills. Health maintenance organizations, for instance, provide a broad range of care. But, according to consultant Johnson andamp; Higgins, &quot;there is a perceptible uneasiness among employers&quot; about how effectively HMOs contain costs. Ed Freedman of Alexander andamp; Alexander Services, another consultant, says employers don't see HMO savings being passed back.    Preferred provider organizations, which work through hospitals and doctors that cut fees, can pare 10% from average medical bills. But Thomas Billet of Johnson andamp; Higgins suggests patients may use these services more frequently, so savings could be illusory. Patients also might use PPOs for routine care but switch to regular fee-for-service insurance to pay higher-priced specialists whenever there's a complication.    &quot;In the past we've tried to solve all problems with one solution. It isn't that simple,&quot; Mr. Freedman says.    WINTER RIVALS SUMMER as prime executive vacation time.    Anthony Altmann, president of Allegheny andamp; Western Energy Corp., says corporate officials are finding it increasingly difficult to take traditional two-week summer vacations. &quot;They tend to spread them throughout the year,&quot; he says. During the winter, he skis. So does Michael Perry, president of Key Centurion Bankshares Inc. &quot;Rather than grumbling about the bad weather, the winter vacation gives us something to look forward to,&quot; he explains.    Vacations have &quot;pretty much equalized between winter and summer,&quot; with aggressive promotions by airlines and cruise ships pushing the trend, says Frommer Travel Service in Washington, D.C. Some executives, though, don't have much choice. At Adolph Coors Co., for instance, production peaks in the summer, so executives traditionally have taken winter vacations. Besides, Colorado slopes are beckoning then.    TRYING A PALACE COUP can be hazardous to an executive's career.    Joseph O'Donnell was abruptly fired recently at JWT Group Inc. when he proposed stripping Don Johnston, the chairman and chief executive, of his day-to-day operating duties. But other grabs for power have proved successful. Some years back, Lewis Glucksman pushed Peter Peterson from the helm of Lehman Bros. Kuhn Loeb Inc.    Fred Adair of consultant Temple, Barker andamp; Sloan says planning is essential for any No. 2 eyeing the boss's job. The executive must line up support among peers and subordinates as well as directors, and arrange the timing of projects and reports to his best advantage. Most essential is convincing board members that he offers a better strategy and can move the company toward that goal. &quot;If you make it a personality contest, you'll probably lose,&quot; Mr. Adair says.    Power struggles go on all the time, he adds, but circumstances don't often mesh for a coup to succeed.    EMPLOYER RISKS GROW. Fully 40% of the companies questioned in Maryland say they were hit by discrimination claims in the past five years. One in four companies had wrongful-discharge claims and 9% were accused of sexual harassment, according to a survey by Laurdan Associates and Robert Hitlin Research Associates.    SOBRIETY TRIUMPHS, at least so the boss thinks. Accountemps, an office-temporary firm, says the vice presidents it interviewed think only one in four executives now takes a drink during lunch. These same vice presidents believe that's down from one in three executives five years ago.    LIVE, IN COLOR . . . From their own offices, executives of General Electric Co., Harris Corp. and Boeing Co. are interviewing students on Georgia Tech's Atlanta campus via satellite television. The companies are evaluating the pilot sessions. Video Placement Inc., the producer, says travel savings could more than offset TV costs.    JOB-SERVICE STAFFERS in a dozen states volunteered to work without pay yesterday, Washington's Birthday, to keep phone lines open for employers with job openings to fill. The states must offer the volunteers an optional day off, but many staffers aren't expected to take it, says Mike Deisz, the agency director in North Dakota, one of the participating states.    DIRECTOR CERTIFICATION: Should you prove competence to sit on a board?    John Nash, president of the National Association of Corporate Directors, says candidates for board seats should be required to pass a basic test. &quot;The ability to read and understand financial statements is a prerequisite&quot; that directors should be able to demonstrate, along with a knowledge of other business matters, he says.    But William Chisholm, president of Boardroom Consultants, says major companies already do a good job picking qualified directors. Some board members, moreover, might resent having to prove their competence with a test. Even so, he says, certification &quot;might have merit&quot; for medium and smaller companies pressed to place more outsiders on their boards.    Smaller companies are finding it increasingly difficult to find qualified outsiders, Mr. Chisholm says.    THE CHECKOFF: No job security at the top. Tarnow International, a recruiter, says 65 chief executives of the 500 largest companies switched jobs last year. Most were pushed. . . . Michigan National Corp. charges workers who smoke an extra $10 a month for health insurance. </TEXT></DOC>
