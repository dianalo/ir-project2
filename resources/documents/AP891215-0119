The rebels have accomplished what they wouldwant to do _ create panic.''   U.S. diplomats say there has been no exodus of foreigners, whoincluded about 100,000 Americans, since mutineers in the militarystaged a nine-day coup attempt that started Dec. 1.   But rumors of a new attempt are sweeping the city. Travel agentsand other sources in the foreign community say many foreigners havelost confidence in the Aquino government and plan to leave if thesituation deteriorates.   Travel agents said they are swamped with requests for open-datedairline tickets from worried foreigners as well as wealthyFilipinos. None of the agents wanted to be quoted by name for fearof being accused of hurting the travel industry.   ``Wealthy Filipinos are more scared. They are frantic,'' said anAmerican travel agent. ``Americans are a little bit more sturdy.They are not leaving now but they are preparing to leave. They wantto be able to get out of the airport until they feel danger isover.''   The recent coup attempt shook the foreign community more thanthe previous five during the Aquino administration because much ofthe fighting occurred in Makati, the financial district wherethousands of foreigners live.   Hundreds of tourists and business travelers, including at least164 Americans, were trapped for four days during fierce fighting inthe district.   Also, President Bush's decision to order U.S. war jets tosupport government troops raised fears of reprisals againstAmericans. On Thursday, unidentified assailants fired two grenadesinto a U.S. government housing area. The attack caused no injuriesbut reinforced fears that foreigners were no longer safe.   ``They are not very happy with the situation,'' another travelagent said. ``They worry that there's going to be a coup, there'snot going to be one, (there will be) terrorist attacks. They feelthey are not very safe going out into the streets or shopping. Theyfeel very insecure.''   Although careful not to play up the strains, the U.S. Embassyhas made available ``stress counseling'' for those either shaken bythe coup attempt or nervous about the possibility of another one.   Some people have left temporarily for Hong Kong or otherneigboring countries, but travel agents are not overjoyed by theextra business.   ``It's not the kind of business I like because if they leave forgood, then it would pull business downward,'' said one travelagent. ``If they get too panicky that means a loss of corporaterevenues.''   U.S. officials have been reviewing their procedures for helpingAmerican nationals leave the country in case of an emergency.Several other expatriate organizations, including thePhilippine-American Chamber of Commerce, have set up networks tokeep foreigners informed of the situation.   Meanwhile, tourist officials say would-be visitors are cancelingtrips.   Tourism Secretary Peter Garrucho said the travel industry maylose up to $550 million in gross earnings next year because ofestimates that up to 500,000 prospective tourists will travelelsewhere.   One travel agent said 500 of 6,000 delegates who earlierconfirmed they would attend an international medical conventionhere in February already have backed out.   Hotel managers, who had been turning away guests a month ago,said occupancy in some five-star establishments has dropped as lowas 29 percent.   Occupancy at the country's most luxurious hotels, Manila Hoteland Westin Philippine Plaza, has dropped by 50 percent, managerssaid.</TEXT></DOC>
