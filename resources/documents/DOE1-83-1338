In this paper, on the basis of the trend in foreign countriestoward the practical use of FBRs, the results of the research on largeFBR design being carried out by the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel DevelopmentCorp. and the technical tendency which becomes the key to the practicaluse of FBRs are studied. The classifications of FBR cores and fuels,the structures of FBRs and the combination of machinery and equipment,the heat transport system, the decay heat removing system and the fuelhandling system are discussed. As to the system concept for FBR plants,the plant performance such as the scale of power output, temperaturecondition and breeding property, the design of core fuel such as targetburnup, the image of cores and fuel design, the structures of FBRs, theheat transport system, the decay heat removing system, the fuel handlingsystem and so on are considered. Guideline for the design of high temperaturestructures for the Class 1 machinery and equipment of the prototype FBRwas decided. (Kako, I.).</TEXT></DOC>
