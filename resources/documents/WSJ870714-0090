The move, which follows the sales last year of the company's book-publishing and music-publishing operations, reflects CBS's continuing drive to focus on its core business, broadcasting. But a CBS spokesman said the record unit isn't for sale.    The company's magazine group is currently the company's smallest unit, accounting for about 8% of CBS sales. It mainly publishes 21 magazines, including Modern Bride, Stereo Review, Woman's Day and Field andamp; Stream.    A CBS spokesman said the management offer, led by the magazine group's president, Peter G. Diamandis, &quot;was so attractive&quot; that Laurence A. Tisch, CBS president and chief executive officer, &quot;felt obligated to pursue it with the board, and the board considered it in the interest of shareholders.&quot;    But analysts said Mr. Diamandis probably will have to sell some of the unit's publications and cut staff to handle the high debt burden of the leveraged buyout. In a leveraged buyout, the purchase of a company is financed largely with borrowed money, which usually is repaid through cash flow and the sale of assets.    The sale is expected to be completed by Sept. 30, resulting in a large, undisclosed third-quarter gain.    In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, CBS shares closed at $181.50, up $2.    CBS sources said the management bid was prompted by several recent unsolicited bids for the unit, including a proposal of about $600 million presented two weeks ago to Mr. Tisch from Hachette S.A., a large French publishing concern.    Mr. Tisch last year rejected a smaller bid for the division from Hachette, but indicated at the time that he would be willing to consider other bids of more than $600 million. The company sources said the latest Hachette bid, which Mr. Tisch also rejected, spurred Mr. Diamandis to quickly put together a buyout proposal.    The $650 million bid &quot;was too good for Tisch to pass up,&quot; said one CBS official. CBS directors, at their regular monthly meeting last week, gave Mr. Tisch approval to negotiate the transaction.    Under the buyout, Mr. Diamandis and other managers and investors will own 30% of the magazine company, while affiliates of Prudential Insurance Co. of America will provide the financing and will own 70% of the new concern. Prudential's board is scheduled to meet today to vote on the proposal.    CBS sources said the $650 million price for the magazine division, which employs about 1,400 people, is about 14 times its 1986 cash flow of $47 million. In the media industry, cash flow is operating profit before taxes and interest plus depreciation and amortization charges. In the first six months of 1987, the division's operating profit soared to $9 million from $1.8 million a year earlier, on sales of $198.5 million.    &quot;It's a full price for Diamandis; he's got his work cut out for him,&quot; said Edward J. Atorino, media analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. &quot;He's obviously got a big interest burden and may have to do serious cost-cutting or restructuring.&quot;    In an interview, Mr. Diamandis said it was too early to comment on plans for the unit. But he said, &quot;We're going to be a lot more aggressive as owners than managers.&quot; A longtime magazine executive, Mr. Diamandis, 55 years old, joined CBS in 1982 as vice president and publisher of the womens magazine group and was named group president in 1983.    The sale comes less than three years after CBS's 1985 purchase of 12 consumer magazines for $362.5 million from Ziff Corp., New York. CBS was widely criticized for overpaying for the publications; the company later filed suit against Ziff, charging the company misrepresented profits of the magazines. The case is still pending, though some of CBS's charges have been dismissed. CBS will continue to pursue the suit after the sale, a CBS spokesman said.    In 1986, the company sold its book-publishing division for $500 million and its music-publishing operations for $125 million. The company last year rejected a proposal to sell its highly profitable record division for $1.25 billion to Sony Corp. of Japan and Walter R. Yetnikoff, president of the record unit.    Mr. Yetnikoff has sought to revive that proposal at least once in recent months, CBS sources said. Mr. Tisch is said to favor the idea -- at a high price -- but it is understood that CBS directors, including Chairman William S. Paley, continue to oppose the move. CBS sources said they expect Mr. Yetnikoff to renew his efforts to buy CBS Records in light of the proposed magazine division sale. Mr. Yetnikoff couldn't be reached for comment.    When completed, the sale of the magazine division will give CBS total cash of about $1.5 billion, though it also has about $1 billion in debt. In a statement, CBS said it &quot;remains interested in expansion and potential acquisitions&quot; in records and broadcasting. </TEXT></DOC>
