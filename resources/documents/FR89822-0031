A permit must be obtained before a regulated article can beintroduced in the United States. The regulations set forth procedures forobtaining a limited permit for the importation or interstate movement ofa regulated article and for obtaining a permit for the release into theenvironment of a regulated article. The Animal and Plant Health InspectionService (APHIS) has stated that it would prepare an environmental assessmentand, when necessary, an environmental impact statement before issuing apermit for the release into the environment of a regulated article (see52 FR 22906).  Iowa State University at Ames, Iowa, has submitted an application for apermit for release into the environment, to field test genetically engineeredtobacco plants modified to express a bacterial chloramphenicol acetyl transferaseenzyme in order to confer resistance to the antibiotic chloramphenicol.The field trial is to take place in Ames, Iowa.  In the course of reviewing the permit application, APHIS assessed the impacton the environment of releasing the tobacco plants under the conditionsdescribed in the Iowa State University application. APHIS concluded thatthe field testing will not present a risk of plant pest introduction ordissemination and will not have any significant impact on the quality ofthe human environment.  The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact, whichare based on data submitted by Iowa State University, as well as a reviewof other relevant literature, provide the public with documentation ofAPHIS' review and analysis of the enviromental impacts associated withconducting the field testing.  The facts supporting APHIS's finding of no significant impact are summarizedbelow and are contained in the environmental assessment.  1. A gene which has the effect of making tobacco plants express a bacterialchloramphenicol acetyl transferase enzyme has been inserted into a tobaccochromosome. In nature, the genetic material contained in a chromosome ofthese plants can only be transferred to another sexually compatible plantby cross-pollination. In this field test trial, the inserted gene cannotspread to any other sexually compatible plant by cross-pollination becausethe field test plot is located at a sufficient distance from any sexuallycompatible plant with which these experimental tobacco plants could successfullycross-pollinate.  2. Neither the proteinase inhibitor II promoter or terminator signal sequence,the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene itself, nor the chloramphenicolacetyl transferase gene derived product confer on tobacco any plant pestcharacteristic.  3. The potato variety (Russett Burbank), from which the proteinase inhibitorII promoter and terminator signal sequences were obtained, is not a plantpest.  4. The chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene does not provide the geneticallyengineered tobacco plants with any measurable selective advantage overnongenetically engineered tobacco plants in its ability to be disseminatedor to become established in the environment.  5. The plasmid vector used to transfer the chloramphenicol acetyl transferasegene into the tobacco chromosome has been evaluated for its use in thisexperiment. The plasmid vector, although derived from the DNA of a tumorinducing (Ti) plasmid with known plant pathogenic potential, has been disarmed;that is, genes that are necessary for pathogenicity have been removed fromthe plasmid vector. The plasmid vector has been tested and shown to benot pathogenic to any susceptible plant.  6. The vector agent <T3>Agrobacterium tumefaciens, </T3>a phytopathogenic bacterium, was usedto deliver the vector DNA and the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase geneinto tobacco plant cells. The vector agent has been demonstrated by <T3>in vitro </T3>and <T3>in vivo </T3>assays to be eliminated and no longer associated withany genetically engineered tobacco plant or seed.  7. Horizontal movement by infectious transfer or transposition of any ofthe introduced genes or DNA sequences is not known to be possible. Theplasmid vector acts by delivering the gene to the tobacco genome whereit is stably inserted into the tobacco chromosomal DNA. The plasmid vectorcannot replicate independently of its vector agent and does not survivealone in any plant. No mechanism of horizontal movement is known to existin nature to move an inserted gene from a chromosome of a genetically engineeredplant to any other organism.  8. The size of the field test trial plot is small (50 feet by 120 feet).The plot will be located on a research farm which will provide good security.The level of physical containment has been found to be adequate to preventan accidental release or dissemination in the environment.  The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact havebeen prepared in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4331 <T3>et seq.</T3>), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental QualityImplementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR parts 1500-1509),(3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR Part 1b), and (4) APHIS GuidelinesImplementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272-51274,August 31, 1979).<ITAG tagnum="21">Done in Washington, DC, this 17th day of August 1989.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Larry B.
