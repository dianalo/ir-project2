This is envisioned to be importantfor any central power station in the 21st century and crucial for futurespace applications. Various novel conversion methods are briefly considered,including direct collection, magnetic expansion, synchrotron radiationconversion, and nonthermal neutron energy conversion methods. Due tothe intimate connection between the type of fusion fuel, the confinementscheme, and the energy conversion technique, all three elements mustbe optimized simultaneously for high overall efficiency.</TEXT></DOC>
