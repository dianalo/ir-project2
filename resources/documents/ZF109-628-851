 The leading productivity networksoftware packages add to the the problem by an inconsistency inproprietary file formats.andP;  Mezzanine's relational catalog serverof system information encourages network transparency by enablingsimple file access and retrieval.andP;  The catalog server takesadvantage of many new features of LAN-based systems in offeringimage management, document management, and office automation.andP;  Theapplication's success is due to its independence from hardware andnetwork operating systems.andP;

 The principal challenge comes inmanaging and maintaining data in an environment where multiple users need toaccess data distributed accross multiple network servers.andM;Saros Corp., a software-development company based in Bellevue, WA, is one ofthe first firms to address this challenge.andP;  Its product, Mezzanine, adocument server based on Microsofths OS/2 SQL Server, uses powerfulserver-to-server techniques and SQL (structured query language) technology tomanage complex PC information problems.andM;The complexity of network software integration has lain in the inconsistentproprietary file formats in the leading productivity software packages.andO;Lotus, WordPerfect, dBase and others all have their own method of fileformatting, making the movement of information among various packagesextremely difficult at best.andM;Then, with the development of the SQL database server and Microsoft's supportfor DDE (dynamic data exchange) under Windows 3.0, systems integrators couldoffer end-uers the robustness of minicomputer-based systems, while preservingtheir freedom of choice in personal productivity applications.andP;  Thecut-and-paste integration available under Windows 3.0 acknowledges anend-users' need to get diverse file formats to talk to each other.andM;Three levels of developmentandM;Mezzanine's relational catalog server of system information makes file accessand retrieval simple and network transparent.andP;  As a network-independentplatform for application integration, Mezzanine offers three levels ofapplication development:andM;1.andP;  The Saros application macro language (AML) interface.andM;2.andP;  DDE support.andM;3.andP;  The Sarols application program interface (API).andM;The AML interface works in conjunction with the scripting programminglanguage of the various DOS programs (e.g.andP;  WordPerfect).andP;  The end-user nowgains transparent access to the network for basic file operations.andM;DDE support gives the network integrator the ability to customize the programinterface so end-users can access the network with the commands andtechniques they require.andM;The strength of the Saros API program interface lies in the object-oriented Csubroutine calls which allow the development of custom program interfaces tothe network, which is application independent.andP;  The use of these program APIswill aid in network management, network file access and network operation.andM;Exploiting new LANsandM;The Mezzanine catalog server, coupled with application customizing, takesadvantage of the newer features of LAN-based systems, including documentmanagement, image management and office automation.andP;  Saros' network operatingsystem (NOS) independence offers integrators a platform for storagemanagement and retrival using existing system and application software.andP;  Thekey, of course, is the application's independence from hardware and networkoperating systems.andM;Topics that are becoming more important to the corporate world are:andM;* A market shift toward open systems and industry standards;andM;* A concurrent balancing of mainframe consolidations;andM;* The resulting implications regarding outsourcing, summary experiences andapplication downsizing.andM;These are areas in which systems integrators must develop experience asquickly as possible.andP;  Few clients want to be guinea pigs in a field theybarely understand, nor are they inclined to go out on a limb with anintegrator who clearly lacks dependable experience in a field that is so new.andM;Corporations have just about had it with the cost of supportingmission-critical appications at 1970s' prices.andP;  Downsizing is happening at anever-increasing pace in the hardware realm.andP;  The applications for corporatedecision-support system with the necessary integrity are knocking loudly atthe door.andM;Touching up the tried and trueandM;Customized network application integration calls for adding customprogramming to proven third-party packages.andP;  Colle ctively they perform at alevel end-users experienced in the past with turnkey application-softwareproducts.andP;  In the early 1980s end-users purchased turnkey minicomputer-basedsystems and relied on the hardware vendor to supply the software for theircomputing requirements.andP;  With the advent of the PC, end-users experiencedfreedom of choice for the first time.andM;Applications that had justified buying a specific hardware platform becamejust features for the desk top user.andP;  Software prices for the desktop devicesare a fraction of the cost of what they would be for a comparableminicomputer-based system, and users have also become quite proficient withthe various desktop operating systems.andM;Kenneth G. Banks is founder and president of IPC Technologies Inc., anetworking systems integrator in Richmond, VA.andP;  He has served on Dest Corp.,andO;Kurzweil Computer Products Inc., NBI Inc. and Sun Microsystems Inc. dealerscouncils.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
