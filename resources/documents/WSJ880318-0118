Sandra Yates, president of Fairfax in the U.S., and Anne Summers, Fairfax's U.S. vice president, said they have offered to buy Fairfax's two American magazines, Ms. and Sassy, for an undisclosed price. Ms. Yates came from Australia last June to launch Sassy, a magazine for teen-age girls. She also negotiated the purchase of 15-year-old Ms. magazine for Fairfax last September.    Fairfax, Australia's biggest publisher after Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., has been selling assets to cut the borrowing costs of its takeover late last year by a member of the founding family. The company recently announced that it would divest itself of two of its best-known newspapers in Australia. It has already sold its Australian magazine division and some smaller newspapers.    Ms. Yates said discussions with Fairfax about the management buy-out began last December, after the parent company went private. Ms. Yates and Fairfax had an understanding, she said, that she would have the first chance to buy the magazine if Fairfax ever put it up for sale.    Ms. Yates and Ms. Summers have hired the Jordan Group to help them with negotiations and financing. Wilma Jordan, head of the group, said they were talking with several investors who were interested in buying the magazine with the current management.    Ms. Yates said it was too early to tell how well the two magazines are doing with the new ownership. Only three issues of Ms. have been published under Fairfax management, and the second issue of Sassy has just hit the newsstands. Ms. Yates says advertisers' response to Sassy has been &quot;particularly encouraging.&quot; Advertising growth in Ms. has been slow but steady, Ms. Yates said.    The new management wants to make Ms. a stronger entry among women's magazines by appealing to an influential, affluent readership that is feminist but doesn't identify &quot;with the tone of the old Ms.,&quot; Ms. Summers has said. To that end, Fairfax overhauled the editorial format and promoted the magazine heavily to help it grow in the face of several competitors that didn't exist when the magazine was founded in 1972.    Working Woman magazine, for example, begun a decade ago, has advertising revenue of $25 million. Ms. had ad revenue of $5.7 million last year. </TEXT></DOC>
