The remaining wet marketedproduction totaled 1492 billion cubic feet. Dry gas production (wet marketedproduction minus 70 billion cubic feet of extraction loss) totaled anestimated 1422 billion cubic feet, similar to the November 1987 level.The total dry gas supply available for disposition in November 1988 wasestimated at 1702 billion cubic feet, including 173 billion cubic feetwithdrawn from storage, 12 billion cubic feet of supplemental supplies,and 95 billion cubic feet that were imported. In November 1987, dry gasavailable for disposition totaled 1684 billion cubic feet. Of the totaldry gas supply available for disposition in November 1988, an estimated1467 billion cubic feet were consumed, 148 billion cubic feet were injectedinto underground storage reservoirs, and 5 billion cubic feet were exported,leaving 82 billion cubic feet unaccounted for.</TEXT></DOC>
