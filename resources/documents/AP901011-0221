The New York Times reported Thursday that the book, ``Survivingat the Top,'' has tumbled off its best-seller list after only sevenweeks. The book, which expounds upon his self-proclaimed triumphsand was published by Random House, is a sequel to ``The Art of theDeal,'' which remained on the best-seller list for 48 weeks afterits publication in 1987.   According to the Times, some booksellers believe far too manycopies of the sequel were printed. A Random House spokesman saidthe publisher printed 500,000 copies and sales have been very good.Still, sales remain beneath ``The Art of the Deal,'' of whichnearly one million copies were sold.   Perhaps the public has had its fill of the musings of the44-year-old entrepreneur, who has come to symbolize the image ofthe brash 1980s by surrounding himself with luxury and building anempire of real estate, casinos and an airline on borrowed money.All three of his businesses have slumped sharply because of aslowing economy.   Trump's financial problems have been the object of repeatedspeculation in recent months, including recurrent rumors that hewill be forced to seek bankruptcy protection. But Trump's aides andsome of his creditors have said they believe negotiations tostretch out his debt payments will succeed.   Still more bad news surfaced Thursday, when the Wall StreetJournal reported Trump will have to restructure more loans for hisAtlantic City gambling empire. The negative account comes just daysafter Forbes magazine bumped Trump off its exclusive 400 RichestAmericans list, estimating his net worth to possibly be within``hailing distance of zero.''   The Journal said Trump has been forced to restructure $100million in bank loans to the Trump Castle and Trump Taj Mahalcasinos because they aren't generating enough cash to repay thatdebt.   Trump already is in negotations with bondholder groups torestructure $675 million in Taj Mahal debt. Two months ago henegotiated a $65 million bank bailout that was supposed to give himbreathing room to repay his loans, which together are believed tototal more than $3 billion.   The Journal quoted unidentified people close to Trump's lendersas saying representatives of National Westminster Bank USA andMidlantic National Bank have been meeting with Trump aides torestructure loans for the two Atlantic City casinos and technicallycould foreclose on them if the debts aren't paid. Each bank is owedapproximately $50 million.   Bank officials declined to comment. Trump's chief financialofficer, Stephen Bollenbach, confirmed that talks are under way butdisagreed with the characterization that the negotiations are asign the developer's operations have deteriorated further.   ``The way to look at this is we've got some very good businessin Atlantic City holding up very well in difficult times, and theyjust aren't quite good enough to cover currently all their debtservice,'' he said in a telephone interview.   ``I think everybody understands that,'' Bollenbach said. ``It'sa temporary problem. This is unlike other situations you readabout, where you have a basically flawed business.''   Takevover investor Carl Icahn declined to comment Thursday onthe Journal's account that he was believed to have bought Trump'scasino bonds as a long-term investment. Bollenbach said he hadheard rumors of an Icahn purchase but it didn't concern him.   ``I know Mr. Icahn is a sophisticated bond investor. I assume hebought them at a discount,'' Bollenbach said. ``I suppose he seesvalue in them.''</TEXT></DOC>
