 Contract Spurred Development of Mac TopicandM;Verity Inc.'s Topic document retrieval system will be available for the AppleMacintosh this year.andM;Officials of the Mountain View, Calif., company said they expect support forthe Macintosh to increase Verity's presence in the federal sector.andP;  Severalagencies, such as the Internal Revenue Service, the National ScienceFoundation and various intelligence agencies, use Topic on Digital EquipmentCorp. minicomputers, PC networks and Unix machines.andM;If fact, it was in response to a government contract that Verity decided todo a Macintosh version of Topic, said Sharon Ray, a Verity vice presidentheading up the company's federal operations.andP;  Verity developed the Macintoshversion of Topic for the Air Force's Worldwide Military Command and ControlSystem Information System (WIS) contract last year.andM;Though the Air Force awarded the contract to Honeywell Federal Systems Inc.andO;of McLean, Va., the contract remains in limbo following a protest by MartinMarietta Corp.andP;  With Apple as a subcontractor, Honeywell bid the Macintoshwith various applications software including the new Topic product, Ray said.andO;Though that procurement has not been resolved, sources said the DefenseCommunications Agency had purchased several hundred WIS-configuredMacintoshes before the contract was suspended due to protest.andM;Verity's new Macintosh support will let Topic users run networked Topicretrieval clients under the Macintosh graphical user interface to search andaccess documents across distributed databases.andP;  The Topic retrieval clientruns under the MacOS operating system and supports the native Macintosh lookand feel.andM;Topic uses a distributed processing model and takes advantage of everyprocessor in a network.andP;  The distributed model features networked retrievalclients that individually search through a distributed database, using thepower of the desktop as well as the file sharing capability of the network.andO;In addition to the Macintosh interface, Verity will release graphicalinterfaces for the IBM Corp.'s Presentation Manager on OS/2, MicrosoftCorp.'s Windows 3.0 and the X Window System later this year.andM;&quot;Topic's support for the Macintosh underscores our commitment to bringingenterprisewide document retrieval capabilities to the end user's desktop,&quot;said Bob Williams, Verity's vice president of marketing.andM;Topic supports retrievals across large collections of documents stored inmultiple formats on diverse computing platforms.andP;  Topic uses conceptretrieval technology, a search method that relies on a knowledge base oftopics and provides a higher level of retrieval accuracy and performance thanother retrieval methods, company officials said.andM;Topic consists of Topic retrieval clients and a database builder.andP;  The Topicretrieval client, the workhorse of the system, features a graphical,object-oriented query language.andM;The retrieval client fields user requests, determines which documents meetthe search criteria and presents the results to the user in relevance-rankedorder.andM;The database builder is a suite of application utilities used to create,modify and maintain Topic databases.andP;  The database builder works independentof the document format, and document collections can reside anywhere on thenetwork.andM;Topic retrieval clients ill run on Macintosh computers including theMacintosh SE and Macintosh II families under MacOS, Version 6.0 and above.andM;Verity will support Topic Macintosh retrieval clients with DEC, SunMicrosystems Inc., OS/2 and most Unix database servers.andP;  Supported networkswill include Apple's Appleshare, Sun's NFS and 3Com Corp.'s 3Com networkingsystems.andP;  Topic also will support the Macintosh versions of popular desktoppublishing systems such as PageMaker from Aldus Corp.;
