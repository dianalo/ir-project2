The contract, awarded Thursday to the company's DenverAstronautics Group, is seen as an important victory in thecompetitive commercial space market, where Martin Marietta competeswith McDonnell Douglas Corp., General Dynamics Corp. and the FrenchArianespace program to launch private communications satellites andmilitary payloads.   The contract calls for Martin to build a 155-foot Titan 3 launchvehicle and an upper stage booster to propel NASA's Mars Observerout of Earth orbit. NASA is scheduled to launch the spacecraft inSeptember 1992.   The spacecraft will orbit Mars 13 times a day for two years,studying the planet's geology and climate.   Martin officials said the contract could be the first of many inwhich NASA orders not just rockets but the manpower and expertiseto launch them. NASA is encouraging the commercial space industryby choosing to launch some government payloads through privatecarriers.   ``It may well be an example of future U.S. governmentprocurement approaches,'' said Edward Browne, president of MartinMarietta Commercial Titan Inc.   Until recently the Commercial Titan program was a problem areain Martin's otherwise profitable rocket business. The companyoriginally expected to reap up to $300 million annually launchingprivate payloads but later scaled back expectations becasuse thedemand for launch services was below the combined supply of rockets.   The $450 million Mars Observer mission was one of four highpriority missions recommended by a NASA advisory board in 1983.</TEXT></DOC>
