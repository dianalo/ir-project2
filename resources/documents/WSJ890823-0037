The indictment charges that while Mr. Stoddard was chairman and chief executive officer of Michigan National Corp., he bought a Jackson, Mich., branch-bank building and leased it back to a subsidiary bank of Farmington Hills, Mich.-based Michigan National at excessively high rates.    Mr. Stoddard, 58 years old, was convicted on similar charges in 1987, but a federal appeals court overturned the conviction this past May on a technicality.    A three-judge appeals court panel in Cincinnati found that the indictment was flawed -- incorrectly stating that the Michigan National subsidiary involved, Michigan Bank-Midwest, was a member of the Federal Reserve System.    But federal prosecutors say they still can prosecute because Michigan Bank-Midwest is a federally-insured bank. &quot;We think the law has been broken and there is nothing in the (appeals) court's decision that would preclude us from retrying this case,&quot; said Stephen J. Markman, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan.    In the first trial, federal authorities accused Mr. Stoddard of misusing $175,000 of bank funds. Evidence in that trial alleged that Mr. Stoddard used some of the funds to pay for personal expenses, including construction on properties owned by his family and hiring an orchestra for his daughter's wedding.    Mr. Stoddard, who resigned his posts in 1984 following an investigation by federal regulators, couldn't be reached for comment yesterday.    In a related ruling this past March, a federal appeals court panel overturned an order issued by the Federal Reserve Board in 1988 removing Mr. Stoddard from his posts at the bank and barring him from serving in any federally-insured bank. The appeals panel ruled that bank regulators have no authority to remove a person from an office he no longer occupies. </TEXT></DOC>
