The giant local phone company called its proposal ``the mostsignificant change since the breakup of the Bell System in 1984.''   Under the offer, the company would also expand the localtoll-free zone and offer push-button phones without extra charge inexchange for the decreased regulation. If approved by the PublicUtilities Commission, the plan would give customers access tohigh-technology, low-cost services.   Consumer representatives greeted the proposal with trepidation.   ``My biggest fear is that we will have the pretense ofcompetition but not the safeguards of competition,'' said RobertGnaizda, a lawyer who represents six minority and low-income groupsin the Pacific Bell rate case before the Public UtilitiesCommission.   Others would compete in handling local toll calls, but ``therewon't be any real competition'' and ``the company will escapeeffective public and PUC scrutiny,'' Gnaizda said. Pacific Bell'sprofit will exceed $1 billion this year, more than twice itshighest level before deregulation, he said.   The Public Utilities Commission, which has suggested increasingphone company flexibility in the new market created by thedismemberment of the Bell system, will consider all the proposalsduring the next year.   According to Pacific Bell, the new proposal is more generousthan a plan the company presented in January in an attempt toloosen state regulation.   The Public Utilities Commission would continue to approveresidential rates after 1992, but without the exhaustive,three-year inquiry of Pacific Bell's financial structure. Under theplan, regulatory controls would also be loosened to allow newservices to be introduced more quickly.   Monthly business rates would be allowed to rise gradually toapproach the cost of service. However, rates on premium residentialservices such as call-forwarding, call-waiting and speed-dialingwould be cut.   Pacific Bell said it also would expect reduced local toll ratesbecause of competition.</TEXT></DOC>
