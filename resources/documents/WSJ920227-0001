Lloyd Bentsen will propose a taxpackage with a scaled-back version of his tax credit forchildren, a capital-gains tax cut, expanded tax benefits forretirement accounts and variations of President Bush'seconomic plan -- paid for with tax increases on thewealthiest Americans.   Final details rest on cost considerations. The TexasDemocrat, chairman of the tax-writing Senate FinanceCommittee, vows that his bill won't add to the deficit in anyyear. With his panel scheduled to begin voting Tuesday, Sen.Bentsen is struggling to include popular tax cuts that he andother senators want while limiting the proposed tax increasesenough to keep skittish lawmakers on board.</LP><TEXT>   Meanwhile yesterday, after hours of partisan bickering,the House voted 427-1 against a package of Mr. Bush's taxproposals that Democrats had compiled and the administrationhad disavowed. The Republicans instead back a seven-pointpackage that includes Mr. Bush's proposed capital-gains cut,but not his proposed middleclass tax cut. The Democratswanted a vote on Mr. Bush's overall tax proposals, whichinclude some business-tax increases anathema to GOPlawmakers, to dramatize the lack of support even in his ownparty. But Republicans voted as a bloc with Democrats inhopes of rendering the tally meaningless. The sole supporterwas a Democrat, Bill Orton of Utah.   In preparation for today's vote, House Democratic leaderscontinued to hustle for support for their tax package.Private head counts showed them short of a sure majority;most Republicans are expected to oppose the Democratic plan,because it taxes upper-income individuals to finance tax cutsfor other individuals and business. That means Democrats needsupport from all but about 50 of their 268 members to passthe plan.   In any event, the vote is virtually certain to show thatCongress couldn't override the president's threatened veto ofany bill that raises taxes. A statement from TreasurySecretary Nicholas Brady last night urged House Democrats tostop the &quot;political shennanigans&quot; and pass the president'seconomic plan. But House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.)disputed suggestions that Democrats were playing politics,knowing their bill wasn't likely to become law. Democratscan't &quot;all fall down and obey his injunction not to take uplegislation,&quot; he said. &quot;If that were the case, the presidentwould totally control the legislative agenda.&quot;   Sen. Bentsen said his package would be smaller than theHouse Democrats' measure, which includes tax cuts valued at$79.5 billion over six years and $93.5 billion in highertaxes. The tax increases mostly come from a new top rate of35% and a surtax on millionaires.   The senator said his proposal also will include amillionaires surtax, but a new top rate will affectindividuals of much higher income than would be taxed by theHouse bill. While the House Democrats' proposal would applyto individuals with taxable income of at least $85,000 ayear, Sen. Bentsen indicated his proposal would start withindividuals making well over $100,000.   He dismissed Mr. Bush's recent predictions that Democratswould end up taxing everyone with income above $35,000,saying, &quot;We're talking about a tax starting at approximatelyfour times as high as that.&quot;   Sen. Bentsen, who last fall proposed a $300-a-child taxcredit for all taxpayers, said he would limit such a creditto middle-income families. That would help satisfy Democraticcritics, who complained that such tax relief shouldn't go tothe rich. It also would help hold down the proposal's cost.Sen. Bentsen's initial proposal would have cost $60 billionover five years, and he is trying to cut it to something over$30 billion.   He has resisted some Democrats' calls to make the creditrefundable, so that it could benefit poor workers who paylittle if any taxes. Sen. Bentsen argues that pastlegislation provided relief to the poorest taxpayers, andthis year's bill is aimed at the middle class.   The chairman said his proposal will embrace severalprovisions in Mr. Bush's seven-point economic plan, withmodifications.   The provisions include some investment incentive forbusinesses, limited restoration of &quot;passive loss&quot; deductionsfor real estate developers, a reduced tax rate on capitalgains from the sale of assets, an allowance for early,penalty-free withdrawals from Individual Retirement Accounts,and perhaps a tax credit for first-time home buyers. TheHouse Democrats' bill doesn't include a home buyers' credit,an omission that Mr. Bush and Republicans have attacked.   Sen. Bentsen also will propose to repeal a 10% luxury taxon yachts and private airplanes. A number of popular taxincentives, such as credits for business research anddevelopment and for low-income housing, would be extended,although it's unclear whether the extension would betemporary or permanent given cost constraints.   A major part of the package will be Sen. Bentsen'spersonal priority, a liberalization of IRAs. He wants torestore the full deduction to all taxpayers; now the benefitis limited to lower-income families and those without otherretirement plans. Also, he would create a version of the IRAthat gives taxpayers a break when their money is withdrawn,instead of an up-front deduction. And savers with existingIRAs could roll over their accounts into the new type, ifthey paid taxes on amounts previously deducted. The revenuesraised from this last rollover provision would help to offsetsome of the proposal's overall cost, though the revenue lossto the government in future years would be greater than undercurrent law.   ---   Jeffrey H.
