The survey of 1,260 businesses indicates the companies plan togive slightly bigger raises next year while inflation is expected toease a bit.   With higher compensation costs in an atmosphere of greater pricerestraint, employers will likely demand more from their employees,said Eddie Smith, an executive with Hewitt Associates, whichreleased its study Wednesday.   Hewitt, a compensation consulting firm based in suburbanLincolnshire, asked a cross-section of U.S. businesses how much theyincreased their budgets for salaries in 1989 and how much more theyexpected to budget in 1990.   The companies projected increases averaging 5.4 percent next yearwhile the Bush administration is projecting an increase of 4.2percent in a consumer price index that tracks the prices of goodsand services bought by urban wage earners and clerical workers.   Those projections compare with salary increases averaging 5.3percent this year while inflation for wage earners and clericalworkers is running at an annualized rate of 5.1 percent throughAugust, according to the Labor Department.   The increased income taxes on the 5.3 percent raises will morethan offset the apparent edge over inflation, so salaried workerswill actually lose some purchasing power this year for the secondyear in a row, Smith said.   The loss of spending power is ``small, but significant,'' he said.   ``It's more of a statistical concept than something the averageperson is going to feel. But if it continues over time, you're goingto feel it.''   The projected loss of purchasing power extends a patternestablished in 1988, the first year this decade in which inflationoutstripped the average rise in salaried workers' take-home pay,Smith said.   The survey did not include wage increases for union workers, whocomprise 16.8 percent of the work force, according to LaborDepartment figures.   On the brighter side, Smith said an increasing number ofcompanies are shifting compensation dollars to bonus plans or otherincentive programs that reward salaried employees for achievingstated goals.   ``For a large number of salaried workers there is a second sourceof earnings,'' he said.   The Consumer Price Index used in Hewitt's study, known as CPI-W,is a narrower indicator of inflation than the more widely citedCPI-U index, which tracks the prices of products purchased by allurban consumers, not just wage earners and clerical workers.   The Labor Department's CPI-U index shows inflation running at anannualized rate of 4.8 percent through August.   The salary increases in Hewitt's study are substantially greaterthan those reported by the Labor Department for wage and salaryearners in private industry because the government's numbers includehourly and union workers, whose raises are typically smaller thanthose of salaried workers.   The Labor Department said wages for those workers rose 3.3percent in 1987, 4.1 percent in 1988 and 4.1 percent through Augustof this year.</TEXT></DOC>
