But a subsequent bombardment of sell orders on the New York Mercantile Exchange late yesterday wiped out 75% of the gains there. The May delivery contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, closed only 15 cents higher, at $18.52 a barrel. The sell-off on the Nymex was one of the biggest in several months, traders said.    U.S. Navy warships attacked at least two Iranian offshore oil platforms, retaliating for a mine blast that crippled the U.S. guided-missile frigate Samuel B. Roberts last week. The U.S. blames the mine blast on Iran.    The attacks set off a series of confrontations, including Iranian attacks on a British oil rig and a U.S.-flagged supply vessel. Four Iranian patrol boats were fired upon and two frigates that fired on U.S. aircraft were attacked and disabled, the U.S. said.    With most of this news in the market early yesterday, oil futures on the Nymex immediately opened a steep 43 cents higher, at $18.80 a barrel.    However, traders and analysts marveled at how quickly the oil rally turned around as it became clear that full-scale war hadn't broken out. As an initial barrage of wire-service reports about U.S.-Iranian gunplay died down, futures-market speculators quickly began selling to take profits on the day's gains, as well as on those of last week.    &quot;Crude stayed strong all day long because there were more rumors about attacks,&quot; said Eric T. Bolling, a Nymex floor broker. &quot;But there were a lot of profits built into that. Profits were extremely ripe.&quot;    Michael Rothman, senior energy analyst at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, said the market was geared for a rally because of optimism about possible price-propping action at next week's meeting of members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and several non-OPEC exporters. The U.S.-Iran fighting &quot;was something like an adrenaline shot&quot; for that optimism, said Mr. Rothman.    Mr. Rothman said yesterday's price rise was a &quot;knee-jerk&quot; reaction because there is excess capacity from other countries that can make up for Persian Gulf supply disruptions.    Norman Higby, a Menlo Park, Calif., energy forecaster, was even more skeptical. &quot;You will see several more days, and probably a couple more weeks, of hype over this,&quot; he said, referring to the U.S.-Iran hostility. But danger about massive oil disruption because of Persian Gulf fighting has repeatedly been overblown, he said.    Mr. Higby added that yesterday's action probably didn't damage Iran that badly, either. &quot;What the U.S. should do, rather than destroying those oil wells, is capture them as prizes of war and turn their production over for the benefit of the U.S. and its other allies in the gulf,&quot; he said. &quot;That will do more to damage the Iranians than any other action the U.S. could take.&quot;    Meanwhile, OPEC yesterday rescheduled what will be a closely watched meeting with non-OPEC exporters for a week from today, three days later than the original date. As was originally planned, a full meeting of OPEC's 13 ministers will be held after the parlay with the non-OPEC exporters.    Responding to oil's price gains, USX Corp.'s Marathon Petroleum unit; Sun Co.; Citgo Petroleum, a unit of Southland Corp. and Venezuela's state oil company; Du Pont Co.'s Conoco unit; Texaco Inc.; and others yesterday raised the price they pay for West Texas Intermediate by $1 a barrel, to $17.50 a barrel.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Corn and soybean futures prices rose slightly as speculation about hostilities between Iran and the U.S. offset a big selling spree by Candamp;D Commodities at the Chicago Board of Trade. A trader said Candamp;D sold futures contracts covering roughly 17 million bushels of corn and six million bushels of soybeans. Candamp;D is the firm of Richard Dennis, one of Chicago's most active commodity traders. Despite Candamp;D's heavy selling, futures prices were supported by speculation surrounding the U.S. Navy's shelling of Iranian oil facilities in the Persian Gulf. &quot;War speculation is always positive on the grain markets,&quot; said Richard Loewy, a grain analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., New York. Wheat futures prices fell slightly on news of weekend rain in the Southwest, said Victor Lespinasse, a floor broker for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., Chicago. The moisture should improve the condition of the winter wheat crop, which is due for harvest in May.    PRECIOUS METALS: Gold futures closed $3.50 higher, at $459.40 an ounce, but silver and platinum were down slightly. Precious metals had surged early in the day -- gold was up $6.10 at one point -- in reaction to the U.S.-Iran fighting and a subsequent rally in oil prices. But analysts said they were surprised there wasn't more investor demand for precious metals with the military news. &quot;It wasn't very good action if you're expecting an outbreak of World War III,&quot; said Bernard Savaiko, senior precious metals analyst at PaineWebber Inc. &quot;The key here is a lack of investment demand.&quot; He said it will be difficult for gold to break the $460-$465 resistance barrier. David Sypen, manager of the metals-futures desk at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., said there was heavy selling by Middle East investors and gold producers after the initial price rise yesterday morning, despite the threatening news from the Persian Gulf. &quot;It shows the market is quite weak,&quot; he said.    COPPER: Futures prices eased after initial advances in a lightly traded market. May delivery copper closed 1.75 cents a pound lower at 95.70 cents, after first rising to 98.10 cents on a 0.65 cent gain in early trading. One analyst said futures price movements tended to rise and fall in sympathy with sterling, as London traders bought futures here, particularly early in the day in arbitrage dealings. Traders seemed to ignore a drop in warehouse inventories of copper in both the London Metal Exchange and the Commodity Exchange, which are normally a price-strengthening factor, he said. A trade source said demand for copper isn't as quiet as most observers and traders feel it is. &quot;Copper users are buying more metal directly from producers than from merchants, and as a result, some people may not be aware of it,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
