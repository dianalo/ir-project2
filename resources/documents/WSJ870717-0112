The agreement has been approved by boards of both companies. TW Services said it expects to complete the purchase in September. An agreement to acquire Denny's had been expected.    &quot;The acquisition of Denny's will significantly enhance our growth in food services,&quot; said Frank L. Salizzoni, chairman and chief executive officer of TW Services. Mr. Salizzoni had said earlier this year that he intended to focus the company's efforts on the food service and nursing home industries. He had said he anticipated acquisitions in these areas.    New York-based TW Services was formed last December to succeed Transworld Corp. TW Services operates the remaining assets of Transworld, which liquidated in the face of a takeover threat from an investor group led by Ronald O. Perelman, chairman of Revlon Group Inc.    Those assets include Canteen Corp., a food service concern; Spartan Food Systems Inc., a restaurant company; and American Medical Services, a nursing home concern. Trans World Airlines was spun off from Transworld in 1984.    As previously reported, La Mirada, Calif.-based Denny's last week rejected a Marriott Corp. bid to buy the closely held concern for about $854 million, including the assumption of debt. But Marriott is understood to have offered about 20% less equity than TW Services.    Previous accounts of efforts by Marriott and others to acquire Denny's didn't break out the company's debt from the actual offered price.    Denny's operates 1,200 restaurants under its own name nationwide and 70 El Pollo Loco restaurants in California. The company also owns a 42% interest in the 800-unit Winchell's Donut Shops and has food processing and distribution operations. Its revenue in the fiscal year ended last June 30 was $1.2 billion.    In early 1985, Denny's was acquired by an investor group in a leveraged buyout led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, the investment banking arm of New York-based Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., for $800 million, with the equity portion valued at $45 a share, or $46 million.    Merrill Lynch and partners in the firm's LBO fund own 30% of the company, and Denny's management owns another 20%. The remainder is owned by institutional investors, including Prudential Insurance Co. of America, Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. of New York, Wells Fargo andamp; Co. and a Denny's profit sharing trust fund.    Merrill Lynch and its LBO fund stand to about quintuple their original equity investment in Denny's. With a 30% stake of the $220 million equity portion being sold to TW Services, Merrill Lynch and the fund stand to earn a profit of about $50 million on their investment. </TEXT></DOC>
