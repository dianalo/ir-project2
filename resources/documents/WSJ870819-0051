After allowing for tax benefits, the company had a net loss of $5.4 million. That compares with net income of $1.5 million, or 31 cents a share, and pretax profit of $3.5 million for the year-earlier quarter.    As previously reported, the investigation of Matthews andamp; Wright has led to an unprecedented examination of the largely unregulated $730 billion municipal bond market. This, in turn, has led to calls from financiers and politicians for closer regulation of this huge market. The investigation centers on whether bond issues sold as tax-exempt by Matthews andamp; Wright and other underwriters actually warrant tax-exempt status.    Matthews andamp; Wright disclosed the loss and the new details of the investigation in its quarterly 10-Q filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.    The company disclosed that it is the target of seven civil lawsuits related to the inquiry, and that it received a subpoena from the SEC July 22 seeking information on 74 bond issues, 44 of which were underwritten by Matthews andamp; Wright. The company said it is cooperating fully with the SEC in this investigation. The disclosure marks the first time that anyone has mentioned a specific number of issues under investigation.    The municipal bond concern blamed a depressed municipals market and publicity about the investigation for its poor results.    Company officials at the firm's New York headquarters declined to comment on the results, referring calls to Matthews andamp; Wright's attorney David Aushauser, who was in Washington yesterday. Mr. Aushauser didn't respond to messages left with an assistant in Washington.    However, the company's SEC filing gave some insight into the nature of the federal inquiry. &quot;The investigations revolve around the valid issuance, authorization and, in particular, the tax-exempt status of the respective bond issues,&quot; it said.    Matthews andamp; Wright stock closed unchanged at $1.125 in American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
