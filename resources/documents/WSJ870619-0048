The ruling by the Canadian regulatory agency could be a setback for New England states that had counted on the contract to provide 7% of their electricity needs for the 1990s.    Quebec Energy Minister John Ciaccia said the provincially owned utility plans to appeal the ruling to the Federal Court of Canada. New England utility and energy officials said the decision isn't a cause for serious concern yet because of the appeal. They added that there's still time for New England utilities to seek alternative energy sources.    The contract, which was scheduled to take effect in 1990 and would have lasted as long as 14 years, was for a total of 70 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity. With an estimated value of $3 billion, the pact was the largest of its kind ever signed by either Hydro-Quebec or the New England Power Pool, known as Nepool, a consortium of 93 utilities. Under the contract, the price of electricity was to be based partly on the price of oil.    The agency said it disallowed the contract because Hydro-Quebec wasn't able to prove that the exports were surplus to Canadian electricity needs. The utility also failed to demonstrate that the export price wasn't less than the prices for equivalent energy charged to Canadians in neighboring areas, the agency said. By law, exporters of Canada's oil, gas and electricity must meet those tests before they can export energy to the U.S.    It was the first time the National Energy Board rejected in its entirety a contract for electricity exports to the U.S.    Phillip Otness, Nepool's executive director, said the contract represented &quot;an important part of our energy plan for the 1990s.&quot; He said the decision came as a surprise, and that Nepool is &quot;hopeful&quot; it eventually will be changed.    Nepool already imports from Hydro-Quebec about 4% of its electricity requirements, or four billion to five billion kwh a year, said Mr. Otness. Those imports are Hydro-Quebec's daily surplus, whereas under the rejected contract, Nepool would have imported so-called firm energy that couldn't be interrupted by Hydro-Quebec.    The provinces of Ontario, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island opposed the contract. At a public hearing earlier this year, they asked the National Energy Board to disallow the proposed Hydro-Quebec exports, arguing that the provinces needed the electricity, which hadn't been offered first to them.    Mr. Ciaccia, the Quebec minister, said the five provinces would like to buy the energy from Hydro-Quebec and resell it to the U.S. at higher prices. &quot;We don't need those kinds of brokers,&quot; he said. Later, Mr. Ciaccia said the utility may make a new request to export the power after offering it to the other provinces, and that the utility will ask the Canadian goverment to change its export control policy for electricity.    Lin Titus, an official with New Brunswick Electric Power Commission, said the decision was &quot;the only one&quot; that could have been made under the circumstances. He added that Hydro-Quebec's contract with Nepool is &quot;a pretty attractive energy package, and if it's offered to (New Brunswick), it couldn't be rejected out of hand.&quot;    Several members of the Nepool consortium said they were disappointed by the ruling, but not immediately concerned. &quot;If necessary, we can get the power somewhere else,&quot; said Ruth Ludwig Morrissette, a spokeswoman for Central Maine Power Co., Augusta, Maine. She said Central Maine didn't believe the decision would affect its separate plan to purchase 122 billion kwh of electricity from Hydro-Quebec beginning in 1992.    Canadian electricity, however, would become more important to New England utilities if they fail to win regulatory approval to start the controversial Seabrook 1 nuclear plant in New Hampshire and to restart the Pilgrim nuclear plant in Massachusetts, which has been closed for 14 months because of mechanical and management problems.    Massachusetts and New Hampshire have already licensed utilities in the consortium to build power lines needed to move the energy that was contracted from Hydro-Quebec, and the consortium is awaiting federal regulatory approval.    U.S. imports of Canadian electricity have mushroomed over the past decade, growing to 12.7 billion kwh in 1986 from 525 million kwh in 1976.    ---   Gilbert Fuchsberg in Boston contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
