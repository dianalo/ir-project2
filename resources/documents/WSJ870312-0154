The St. Louis-based contractor's unusually visible campaign, which includes advertising, is aimed at overturning a controversial Pentagon decision to phase out funding for the Apache program in its fiscal 1988 budget. In an effort to resurrect the helicopter, McDonnell last week submitted a new proposal to the Army calling for the procurement of an additional 438 helicopters at the current price of about $11.4 million each, including parts built by other contractors. The total cost would approach $5 billion.    The debate over the Apache could become a focal point for critics who believe the military is shortchanging traditional combat arms in favor of strategic weapons. The helicopter -- popularized in the movie Blue Thunder -- has wide support among congressmen who favor a stronger Army.    However, in its budget request for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, the Pentagon is proposing to cut off funding for the helicopter after 593 units are delivered. The military originally had firm plans to buy at least 675 of the helicopters and tentative designs on procuring more than 1,000. McDonnell is building about 140 helicopters a year, and has delivered 200 so far.    &quot;There's no question McDonnell will be able to drum up a lot of sympathy in Congress,&quot; said an aide to the Senate Armed Services Committee. &quot;There's a high level of unhappiness about killing the program.&quot;    Among other things, McDonnell contends that halting production of the Apache would force it to close its new $325 million factory in Mesa, Ariz., which employs 6,000 workers. It also would eliminate the company as a contender for future helicopter programs, it says.    &quot;You have to keep the factory doors open if you want companies to be around for the next program,&quot; said William P. Brown, president of McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Co., a unit of the contractor. &quot;It's not like turning on and off a switch.&quot;    McDonnell Douglas is a partner in one of two contractor teams competing for the LHX light helicopter, the next generation of small attack helicopters that would replace the Army's existing Cobras and Hueys. But LHX production isn't scheduled to begin until at least 1995.    Some military experts in the Congressional Budget Office have suggested postponing the LHX in favor of extending production of the Apache and Blackhawk helicopters. The Blackhawk, a multipurpose helicopter made by the Sikorsky unit of United Technologies Corp., also is slated for a funding cutoff.    Although the Army has said it would buy more Apaches with any additional funds it could receive from Congress, its officials said they have been irritated by aspects of the McDonnell campaign. &quot;Some of their ads on this have been misleading,&quot; an Army spokesman said. &quot;We never wanted to buy as many helicopters as they say we did and we don't have enough people to man all the helicopters they are saying we should buy now.&quot;    Congressional aides and officials in the defense industry, however, think the company has a strong chance of extending the program. &quot;There's a lot of sentiment for this weapon,&quot; said another congressional aide. &quot;McDonnell has been taking a lot of senators and congressmen on rides in the Apache. They come away liking it a lot.&quot;    One of the strongest advocates for the Apache has been Rep. William L. Dickinson, ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, whose Alabama district includes Fort Walker, the center of Army aviation. The subject of the Apache is expected to come up in congressional hearings Tuesday that will focus on Army aviation.    The other contractors on the Apache are General Electric Co., which makes the engines, and Martin Marietta Corp., which produces its vision system. Both have joined McDonnell Douglas's lobbying effort. </TEXT></DOC>
