But now, they also spend substantial time working on working together.    In the past year, GM and United Auto Workers Local 14 have set up a 22-acre &quot;jointness&quot; park, a 13-room &quot;joint-education&quot; wing, a plantwide &quot;joint communications network&quot; with 44 TV monitors, a &quot;joint&quot; newsletter, and 200-plus &quot;joint employee involvement groups.&quot;    Labor-management cooperation has long been hailed as a key to Japan's competitive edge -- and to restoring U.S. industrial power. But the traditional hostility between labor and management in the U.S. makes cooperation difficult. Thus, the simple Japanese ideal of labor-management cooperation, when translated into an American setting, has become highly formalized and bureaucratic. As American labor and management face their greatest competitive challenge, they are pushing a slew of costly new programs, many of which have little to do with building cars but much to do with building mutual trust.    The UAW's effort over the past three years has been wide-ranging. GM and the union recently set up a joint task force on the possible dangers of AIDS in the factories, and the union co-sponsors with the auto makers educational programs ranging from basic literacy to how to buy real estate. Company and union officials say many of these programs are simply designed to improve workers' lives. But an important underlying idea is to find noncontroversial areas for managers and workers to practice cooperation.    &quot;These aren't strictly {job} training programs,&quot; says Lou Ferman, a University of Michigan professor studying the spread of &quot;jointness&quot; for the Ford Foundation. &quot;They are designed to bridge the gap between union and management. They are an exercise in industrial relations.&quot;    Now, this new relationship will get its toughest test. The UAW is negotiating new national contracts with GM and Ford Motor Co., a decades-old, inherently adversarial process. Bitter bargaining -- including a lengthy strike after the contracts expire Sept. 14 -- could shatter willingness to work together. Both sides hope, however, that their new cooperation will reduce negotiating tensions and that the new contracts will strengthen the programs.    If that happens, attention will focus on whether joint programs do anything for the bottom line. Sometimes, there isn't any direct connection. &quot;We had a man come into a basic education course whose granddaughter asked him to help with her homework, and he could not do mathematics at a third-grade level,&quot; says Thomas J. Pasco, the UAW executive director at Ford's training center. &quot;He raised his grade level three grades, and her grades improved. You can't really say how it helps the company and the union.&quot;    But in some places, the elaborate network is yielding dividends. GM's Toledo transmission factory already has shaved $20 million in production costs over the past year, and quality has improved so much that the number of transmissions rejected by assembly facilities has dropped 90%, John D. Crabtree, the plant manager, says. He attributes part of the gains to the joint programs, although he acknowledges that he can't say how much.    The original concept was simple. Joint union-management efforts in the auto industry gained prominence after the 1979 oil crisis, when auto makers found they couldn't afford to buy labor peace with higher wages and benefits. So management offered such intangibles as more power in a more agreeable workplace. That concept spread, but it remained largely an informal, plant-by-plant effort.    Similar changes got under way at the same time in other industries such as steel and communications, but the auto industry later made a commitment unmatched anywhere. In 1982, the UAW negotiated with both GM and Ford to establish jointly administered funds for labor-management programs. In the 1984 negotiations, the financing substantially increased.    GM and Ford now contribute about 20 cents per worker-hour to joint funds for national and local programs. At GM, that cost about $200 million last year, and Ford spent $30 million to $40 million.    Chrysler Corp. has similar programs but won't disclose how much it allocates for them. The No. 3 auto maker started the effort later than did its domestic competitors and hasn't developed it to the same extent. Its current national contract doesn't expire until next year.    The money has transformed labor-management cooperation into the auto industry's &quot;Great Society,&quot; from a well-intentioned idea into a sprawling, complex institution. Since 1984, GM and the UAW have opened up eight regional &quot;human-resource centers&quot; around the country and a national center near Detroit. The Ford-UAW programs have grown so quickly that three trailers currently house the overflow from the four-year-old &quot;national development and training center&quot; near company headquarters in Dearborn, Mich. An addition quintupling the building's size will open at year end.    &quot;Jointness&quot; has spread far and wide. Ford says that since 1982, as many as 40% of its 109,000 hourly workers have taken advantage of the programs. GM and the UAW &quot;are now the largest educational institution in the world,&quot; GM Chairman Roger B. Smith says.    The joint programs have grown so quickly that some plants are having trouble figuring out how to spend the money. Ford's rear-axle and drive-shaft plant in Sterling Heights, Mich., has received an allocation of more than $300,000 for joint programs but has spent only a fraction of that, says Frank Miccolis, the president of the UAW local there. &quot;I've got so much money in the damned fund I don't know what to do with it,&quot; he complains.    Others have had the opposite problem -- wasted money. A group of workers at one Ford plant received tuition assistance to attend flight school. Only one actually took the course, while the rest planned to use the money to buy a plane. They were caught before completing the purchase.    And, like lavishly financed government programs, the joint projects provide valuable political patronage. The UAW has consistently advocated using union members instead of neutral professionals to administer programs. Many local union officials defeated in elections last spring have found new careers in the joint programs.    The programs have spawned a whole new bureaucracy and jargon of jointness. Ford and the UAW have regular &quot;mutual growth forums&quot; in which managers and workers share information about costs and quality. Most Ford and GM plants have at least two full-time joint administrators. In plants with regular &quot;quality of worklife&quot; groups, former assembly-line workers have become full-time &quot;facilitators&quot; -- people who attend meetings and &quot;facilitate&quot; them by keeping them on course.    GM's Hydra-Matic division holds weeklong &quot;family-awareness workshops,&quot; where employees are supposed to learn &quot;consensus decision making.&quot; Eight hourly and salaried people get together and are randomly assigned head bands with labels such as &quot;expert&quot; or &quot;boss.&quot; They are asked to plan a hypothetical picnic together, and after the usual scrapping, they take the headbands off and try again. &quot;The objective,&quot; says L.C. Nisley, a UAW leader, &quot;is to show that if we all take our headbands off, we can work together to get the job done.&quot;    To give the joint programs credibility, administrators have taken pains to create the appearance of labor-management equality, down to the smallest detail. Coexecutive directors -- one union, one management -- run each organization. No company logo appears without an accompanying UAW logo. At GM's human-resource center in Pontiac, Mich., the co-directors have adjoining offices of equal size and even share a &quot;joint&quot; business card.    But beneath this display of cooperation and equality, meshing two historically hostile cultures still isn't easy. UAW President Owen Bieber has cautioned local unions against losing their &quot;independent voice&quot; through the spread of &quot;joint&quot; publications. Mr. Bieber said the publications shouldn't mention &quot;competitiveness or other economic or social issues&quot; without giving &quot;full and equal treatment&quot; to the UAW's endorsement of trade restrictions.    And within the union, a broader debate rages over whether shared responsibilities really save jobs and whether they blur the union's overall mission. &quot;The membership is starting to turn anti-union,&quot; worries Bob Brown, a UAW official at GM's Toledo transmission plant and a longtime militant. &quot;They are starting to think that management does the things the union did for years and that the union just participates.&quot;    Indeed, balancing cooperation on one hand and confrontation on the other may prove impossible, particularly during the current contract negotiations with GM and Ford. Even Donald F. Ephlin, the UAW vice president most prominently associated with the joint programs, worries about a major battle next month over pay or job security. &quot;This round of bargaining is very critical as to whether we will continue to make progress or fall back to the old ways,&quot; says Mr. Ephlin, who is leading the negotiations at GM.    Joint programs suffered at GM's parts plant in Kokomo, Ind., after a six-day strike last fall over the diversion of work to outside contractors. &quot;Everything pretty well came to a screeching halt,&quot; says Tony Long, the UAW shop chairman at the plant. &quot;It's been slow getting them rolling again.&quot;    But even in Kokomo, the company and the union are still trying to work together. &quot;We can't throw our whole relationship in the ditch over some disagreements on certain issues,&quot; Mr. Long says.    In fact, rather than bargaining upsetting jointness, jointness could change bargaining. From the plant floor to the corporate suites, the companies are trying to foster trust by sharing previously confidential data with the union. Many GM plants now have &quot;competitiveness&quot; rooms decorated with charts on absenteeism and scrap rates. In opening this year's national negotiations in late July, GM gave UAW officials a two-day presentation on its five-year plan. The month before the talks began, GM and UAW negotiators took a weeklong trip together to Japan to get to know each other and to see their competition firsthand.    &quot;We don't pound the table anymore like we used to, or yell and shout and call people names,&quot; says Alfred S. Warren Jr., GM's top negotiator. &quot;We sit down and talk about problems.&quot;    At the local level, joint programs are diminishing the importance of the contract itself. Management at the Toledo plant says it isn't asking for formal changes in work rules -- a highly controversial issue at many plants this year -- because workers have willingly given flexibility through the joint &quot;employee involvement&quot; groups.    For example, 14 Toledo skilled trades workers met in late July to discuss moving their work area from one section of the factory to another, and they were frustrated by delays. Traditionally, they wouldn't even have been involved. The move would have been organized by management and carried out by workers with job classifications allowing them to haul equipment.    But now, the skilled-trades workers were not only organizing the move but also were willing to cross job lines and help. &quot;When I see someone moving benches, what if I want to help him?&quot; asked Dave Ellis, an 18-year plant veteran. &quot;I say I can. . . . We've got to pitch in.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
