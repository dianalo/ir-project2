He faces two charges under the Companies Securities {insider dealing} Act of 1985 relating to takeover bids that were referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.    Authorities allege Mr. Greenwood knowingly obtained from his younger sister, Sara Coren, information that bids by McCorquodale PLC for Richard Clay PLC in August 1985 and a bid by Bet PLC for SGB Group PLC in September 1985, had been referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.    The charges also allege Mr. Greenwood dealt in the companies' shares when he knew the information was unpublished and market price sensitive.    Mr. Greenwood, 28, of North London, headed Greenwood International Securities, which went bankrupt last year with debts of 2 million pounds. After the hearing Friday, Mr. Greenwood's attorney, Michael O'Brien said his client &quot;strongly denies that he had anything to do with insider dealing offenses.&quot; He said an appeal for bail would be made.    Greenwood's sister hasn't been charged with any offenses. </TEXT></DOC>
