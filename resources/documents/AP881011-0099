If the blood-clotting protein proves safe, hemophiliacs may beable to avoid the risk of getting the deadly AIDS virus orhepatitis from donated plasma, scientists say.   The Royal Free Hospital's Hemophilia Center and Hemostasis Unitsaid Victor Budgen of London was the first patient in Britain to beinjected with the substitute protein, factor VIII.   About half a dozen hemophiliacs in the United States and WestGermany have been treated in recent months with geneticallyproduced factor VIII, he said.   Budgen ``responded excellently'' to his first injection lastweek and will be monitored for the next six months, said Dr. PeterKernoff, director of the hemophilia center.   If the treatment is successful, it will be offered to otherhemophiliacs, Kernoff said.   ``There is an uncertainty associated with any new drug,''Kernoff said in a telephone interview. ``I think in this case thereis every reason for optimism because what is produced is virtuallythe same as natural factor VIII.''   Since about 1960, hemophiliacs have gotten factor VIII, whichhelps blood clot, from the plasma of unknown donors. But in theprocess they have risked contract all,'' he said.   About 113 hemophilacs in Britain have developed full-blownacquired immune deficiency syndrome and an estimated 1,100 havebeen infected with the AIDS virus because of exposure tocontaminated blood products, Kernoff said.</TEXT></DOC>
