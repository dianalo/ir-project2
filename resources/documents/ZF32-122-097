(pen-basedcomputing), Novell (networking), Micrografx (graphics and porting), andBorland (development tools).andM;But one expected alliance did hit a snag just as Windows Watcher went topress.andP;  Apple and IBM were preparing to announce a technology alliance, butdisagreements led to a last-minute postponement.andP;  Sources close to thediscussions, however, say the delicate talks have not collapsed, and progresstoward an agreement is being made which could change the balance of power inthe computer industry.andM;IBM and Apple have been discussing a technology trade that could help bothcompanies compete more effectively against Microsoft.andM;It's no secret that IBM wants to lessen its dependence on Microsoft.andP;  One wayto do so would be to develop advanced operating environments based ontechnology from other companies -- such as Apple.andP;  Under this scenario, IBMwould license software from Apple that would allow it to add Macintosh-likefeatures to forthcoming version of OS/2 or other operating systems.andM;For its part, Apple wants to license the IBM RISC chip, a microprocessor thatcould be used for advanced workstations.andP;  Such a workstation would providecompetition for a recently announced workstation effort jointly sponsored byCompaq, Digital, and Microsoft.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
