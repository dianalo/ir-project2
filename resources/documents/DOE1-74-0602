Technologywhich has advanced jet engines is classified into two categories: (1)hardware technology for manufacturing large, high-performance, low-fuel-consumptionengines suitable to aircraft transport by improving the thermal efficiencyof gas turbines and raising the bypass factor using large fans and (2)software technology which has become influential on hardware technology.The progress of technology in these two categories has reduced the fuelconsumption to a half of that in early pure jet engines; it has alsoimproved the reliability by one order of magnitude. In addition, it isnecessary to understand that apparent technical advance in jet engineshas been brought about by the development of related peripheral, fundamentaltechnology. (2 figs)</TEXT></DOC>
