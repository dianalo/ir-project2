For most of the past four decades since the Communist takeover,the Socialists have been docile junior partners who carefully toedthe line of the ruling party and even accepted its leading role intheir statutes.   But with the ruling party in disarray following a week of hugepro-democracy demonstrations, they are beginning to flex theirmuscles.   Last week, they issued what a senior party official called a``declaration of independence,'' printed in the party newspaper,Svobodne Slova, or Free Word.   It was a formal and forceful defense of freedom of opinion and aplea for an ``open dialogue'' about the future of this country. Itwas published three days after police clubbed students peacefullydemonstrating on Nov. 17.   The crackdown triggered a wave of huge protest demonstrationsthat eventually brought a shake-up in the Communist leadership. Atthe same time, the Socialists' prestige soared.   Since the declaration was published Monday, speakers at theprotest rallies have addressed the hundreds of thousands ofdemonstrators in Wenceslas Square from the party newspaper buildingalong the square.   ``You may call that statement a declaration of independence,''Dr. Jiri Vyvadil, head of the Socialist faction in the CzechoslovakFederal Parliament told The Associated Press. ``Now, we have becomea real party.''   Vyvadil, 35, portrays his party as left of center, and said ithas close contacts with the East German Liberal Democratic Partythat also has increasingly distanced itself from the Communists.   ``We don't want to be heroes,'' he said. ``But the situationdemands it.''   He said his party wants to be a ``party of nationalreconciliation'' and wants a ``consensus with the Communists, butat this moment that is difficult.''   ``Our partners accused us of heating up the situation with ourstatement,'' he said. ``But if they had joined us in our approach,things would be quiet again by now.''   ``The Czech people do not like barricades and heroic deeds,'' hesaid. ``We are all a bit conservative, against change.''   The change in the Socialist Party's stance did not comeovernight.   Party chief Jan Skoda, who joined opposition speakers at aprotest rally last week, came out in May with a startling call forgenuine political pluralism and for guarantees of civil rights.   ``Without substantial progress in the democratization ofpolitical, social and economic life we shall not manage to ... gainthe citizens' support for changes,'' he said in a speech thatanticipated the popular pro-reform tide.   A new party platform reflecting the new approach is nearingcompletion. It is to cover a wide list of points, ranging from acall for a stronger Parliament to a project for a constitutionalcourt.   Will the party also call for free, secret elections?   ``Of course,'' Vyvadil said, ``we would like to resume thistradition the country knew under Tomas Masaryk,'' the firstpresident of independent Czechoslovakia.   ``But I am not sure that we will have as many candidates as wewill need,'' he added in a reference to his party's growingpopularity.</TEXT></DOC>
