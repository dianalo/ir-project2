Gorbachev have been arrested, a leadingdissident said Wednesday, the day the Soviet leader left Cuba.   Most of those arrested had planned to take part in apro-Gorbachev demonstration at the Soviet Embassy on Tuesday night,said Elizardo Sanchez, a local human rights activist.   Government spokesman have confirmed that some arrests werecarried out starting Tuesday morning but have not given precisefigures.   Among those arrested was Samuel Martinez Lara, leader of thePro-Human Rights Party. He was the principal organizer of thedemonstration, which was canceled.   There was a heavy police presence Tuesday night outside theembassy, where Gorbachev attended a reception.   Several people who were monitoring developments in the area weretaken into custody, Sanchez and other witnesses said.   The demonstration was to have been aimed at seeking Gorbachev'ssupport for a liberalizing reform program in Cuba similar to theone Gorbachev has carried out in the Soviet Union.   Sanchez, who heads the Cuban Commission for Human Rights andNational Reconciliation, said scores of others may also have beenarrested but he could confirm only 21.   Sanchez, interviewed on ``CBS This Morning,'' said he wasdoubtful Gorbachev's reforms had rubbed off on Cuban leader FidelCastro.   ``I did not have a great deal of hope,'' he said. ``We neverexpected miracles to result from this visit. We trust more in whatwe Cubans can do for ourselves.''</TEXT></DOC>
