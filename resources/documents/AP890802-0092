VERNACI</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Twenty consultants earned more than $5.7million by helping funnel much of the money in a federal housingprogram to developers in a handful of states that didn't need it, aSenate committee was told today.   Most of the 20 consultants were former employees of theDepartment of Housing and Urban Development or well-connectedRepublicans, HUD Inspector General Paul Adams said in a report tothe Senate Banking Committee.   The consultants were paid by developers to help them get aboutone-fifth of the money from a HUD program to repair housing for thepoor.   ``It's so lucrative now that you're going to get some peopledoing some pretty unsavory things to feed at that trough,'' DonaldTerner, president of the non-profit Bridge Housing Corp. in SanFrancisco, told the Senate committee.   Elsewhere on Capitol Hill today, the House Government Operationssubcommittee on housing voted 6-0 to subpoena Lance Wilson, aformer aide to former HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce Jr. Wilson hadbeen scheduled to voluntarily testify last week, but did notappear, saying that he wasn't prepared with legal counsel.   And on the Senate floor, the two party leaders sparred over theHUD scandal, with Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, sayingthe department was ``used as a political slush fund where politicalappointees gave favors ... to politically well-connectedindividuals.''   Mitchell also criticized the leadership of HUD in the Reaganadministration for not heeding the warnings of the inspectorgeneral.   Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., then complained thatappointments to several of the appointments to those posts havebeen bottled up awaiting confirmation by the Senate.   ``Let's make certain we understand that Congress hasn't beenvery cooperative,'' Dole said. ``Now we've got a situation whereSecretary (Jack) Kemp is trying to do the right thing, and hedoesn't have anybody on board.''   The Senate Banking Committee voted 17-0 today to approve one ofthose appointees, C. Austin Fitts, as an assistant HUD secretary.The nomination of Ms. Fitts, who would replace Thomas Demery, oneof the central figures in the HUD scandal, now goes to the fullSenate.   Adams, who conducted the HUD study at the request of Sen. DonaldRiegle Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the Banking Committee, said thewell is starting to run dry for the outside consultants.   ``During our survey, five developers informed us that because ofall the recent media attention, some billings were not paid infull'' to them, Adams wrote in his report.   One of those consultants was Fred Bush, ambassador-designate toLuxembourg, who has had $45,000 in payments withheld since April,the report said. Bush, who is no relation to the president but wasthe chief fund-raiser for his 1988 campaign, was paid $215,000 tohelp land HUD funds for developers.   Joseph Strauss, a former assistant to then-HUD Secretary SamuelPierce Jr., made nearly $1.7 million _ more than any otherconsultant found by Adams' inquiry.   Others included former Interior Secretary James Watt, who got$300,000; former HUD Secretary and now U.S. Trade RepresentativeCarla Hills, who received $138,445; and Paul Manafort, a lobbyistand Republican political strategist, who got $442,000.   Adams has reported before on the use of consultants in obtainingfunds from HUD, but the new report is the first attempt todetermine the extent and expense of the practice.   Under the HUD program, developers were eligible for tax creditsand could get HUD to subsidize the rent of tenants who otherwisecouldn't afford it.   ``Developers often received windfall profits through tax creditsyndication,'' Adams wrote. Excess payments for rent subsidiescould cost the government more than $413 million by 1999, he said.   In all, 51 projects with a total of 7,268 apartments fundedsince October 1983 used consultants, Adams' report found. Thataccounts for about 20 percent of all HUD's work in this area duringthat time.   Of those projects involving consultants, 45 were put in states _notably, Colorado, Oklahoma, Nevada and Wyoming _ that would nothave qualified for the funds if HUD's formulas for determiningeligibility had been used, the report said.   But the two largest states, California and New York, wereshortchanged by about 27 percent each, the report said.   Meanwhile, a related study by the General Accounting Office saiddevelopers were willing to pay high fees to the consultants becausethe structure and oversight of the HUD programs made them virtuallyno-lose propositions.   ``In this manner developers were able to realize substantialgains on their limited investments while undertaking very littlerisk,'' wrote John M. Ols Jr., who prepared the report.</TEXT></DOC>
