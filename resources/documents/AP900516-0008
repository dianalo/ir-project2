It's like a religion.   Any city that would mark the 45th anniversary of its World WarII liberation by filling a surplus battle tank with the famouslocal brew and drinking it in one evening takes its guzzlingseriously.   So it's no wonder Pilsen is headquarters for the national Partyof the Friends of Beer, membership 5,100.   Czechoslovakia is gearing up for its first free elections since1946, and the Friends of Beer hope to win at least a handful ofseats to ensure all those beery late-night arguments aren't fornaught.   Organizers say they are ``completely serious.''   ``Politics was always a favorite subject in Czechoslovak pubs,but it never led to any action,'' said Ludek Sibr, a 25-year-oldstudent teacher and a founder of the party.   Now, he said, pub sitters who dream up answers toCzechoslovakia's many problems could contact their ownrepresentatives in parliament.   The party is concerned with general social and culturalproblems, private enterprise and competition, said Sibr and AntoninJelinek, the group's Prague campaign manager.   But its chief goal is improving pubs ``to restore friendlyrelations between neighbors and not just to promote consumption ofalcohol,'' Jelinek said.   Many believe that during 41 years of Communist rule the cultureof beer drinking declined. Under state management, the once warmand friendly pubs became ugly, unclean filling stations foralcoholics.   The feel of an English pub is what the Friends of Beer aim for,Sibr said.   His party arose out of a student strike in Pilsen that was partof last November's peaceful revolution. After the Communists weretoppled, participants looked for a way to stay active.   A joking suggestion to form a beer-drinkers' party led tounsolicited membership applications in the mail. The studentsdecided to establish a real political party.   The party registered, held a national congress and collectedenough signatures to get on the ballot.   The average member is a 35-year-old male, Sibr said. But theoldest is 79, and 15 percent of the members are women.   It is doubtful Friends of Beer will get the minimum 5 percent ofthe votes needed in the June 8 elections to qualify for seats inthe federal parliament, but it does have a chance of making the 5percent cutoff for the Czech regional parliament, Jelinek said.   Just like the other 22 parties that made the ballot, Friends ofBeer is entitled to four hours of free advertising on radio and TV.   The spots aim to entertain, Jelinek said. One shows a cartoon onhow to drink a glass of beer.</TEXT></DOC>
