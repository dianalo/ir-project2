Addressing concerns expressed Thursday by members of the SenateArmed Services Committee, the officials said the cuts proposed byBush in NATO and Warsaw Pact forces can be accomplished bydestroying older weapons.   ``We have enough of the older weapons that can be destroyedwithout destroying newer weapons,'' said Air Force Gen. Robert T.Herres, vice chairman of the military Joint Chiefs of Staff.   Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., declared: ``It doesn't make sense todestroy $20 million F-16 fighters at a time when our reserve andguard units are still flying 1960's vintage F-4 fighters.''   But Herres said that will not be allowed to happen.   ``We propose to redistribute new equipment such as F-16's andM-1 tanks,'' he said. ``We have no intention of destroying them.Our obvious target will be older equipment.''   He also said there is nothing in the Bush proposal to preventNATO or the Soviets from modernizing the military forces thatremain after reductions.   Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Richard Cheney said in an interviewpublished in The Washington Post today that the United States mightwind up stressing lighter equipment for land forces to ease rapiddeployment if Bush's proposals for armed forces reductions inEurope are accepted.   Cheney said the proposed ceiling of 275,000 troops for both theUnited States and the Soviet Union in Europe might raise otherquestions, such as whether ships would be better than aircraft forreinforcement from the United States in war.   Though the proposal makes military sense, Cheney said he wasworried that Congress would try to double or triple the president'sproposed reduction of 30,000 U.S. troops. ``Maybe eventually we cantalk about those numbers, but not now,'' he said in the Postinterview.   Herres and Under Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz commentedas a broad bipartisan cross section of the committee praised theBush proposal as a potentially historic breakthrough that couldsharply reduce the prospects for war in Europe.   Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., hailed the Bush proposal as taking``an innovative'' approach and said it will ``reduce the dangers ofwar in Europe,'' while posing the possibility of creating futuresavings that could eventually help the United States deal with thebudget deficit.   The Bush proposal calls for:   _Reductions in tanks, armored troop carriers and artillery inthe area from the Atlantic to the Ural Mountains that will requirefar deeper cuts by the Soviet Union and its allies than by theUnited States and NATO.   _Reductions of 15 percent below current levels of helicoptersand land-based combat planes in the Atlantic to the Urals zone.   _A ceiling of 275,000 on U.S. and Soviet ground and air forcepersonnel in the zone, a ceiling which would require a reduction ofsome 325,000 Soviet troops to achieve.   _Speeding up the pace of negotiations and the implementation ofan agreement to accomplish the reductions by 1992 or 1993, aboutfour or five years sooner than the time table suggested by theSoviets.   Herres and Wolfowitz said the plan does not set a rigidtimetable which might trap the United States into accepting a badagreement contrary to U.S. security interests.   And Wolfowitz said it will require verification procedures farmore intrusive than any so far put into effect for any other armscontrol arrangement.   Several committee members declared, and the administrationwitnesses agreed, that no attempt should be made to cut defensespending before agreement on the Bush proposal is reached.   ``We've got to be very careful of not getting out in front ofreality,'' Herres said. ``But if we are successful in the armscontrol adventure, we will be relieving future generations of aconsiderable burden if we can defuse the situation in centralEurope in this way.''   Speaking to reporters after the hearing, Herres remarked:   ``If four or five years ago someone had told me we were going tobe in a position to achieve parity with the Soviet Union in fiveimportant categories I would have walked away laughing.''</TEXT></DOC>
