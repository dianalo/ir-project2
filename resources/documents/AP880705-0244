To others, includingauthorities in the United States and Italy, his dedication was toMammon. Throughout a singularly shady pilgrimage, the Rev. LorenzoZorza never relinquished his role of wide-eyed innocence.</TEXT><BYLINE>By RICK HAMPSON</BYLINE><HEAD>and</HEAD><HEAD>LARRY McSHANE</HEAD><BYLINE>Associated Press Writers</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The most tangible legacy of the Rev. LorenzoZorza's two decades as a missionary is a small patch of concretenear the Consolata Society mission in Somerset, N.J.   On this site the Consolata fathers had weekly sales of usedclothes and furniture to benefit their African missions. Lorenzo'stask: To supervise the lay people who ran the rummage sale.   But the priest had a bigger idea: To transform the site into``Consolata Village,'' a tourist attraction with music, food,rides, a gift shop and a copy of the Trevi Fountain. Zorza had theconcrete fountain base poured before telling the other priests ofhis plans.   ``We said, `Hold it, this isn't our kind of thing,''' recallsthe Rev. Reno Aiardi.   That incident 15 years ago was the first of many attempts byZorza to mix piety and profit. His explanation at the time _ I wasonly trying to help _ would become a refrain as he lurched fromscrape to scrape: In 1982, when he was arrested for art smuggling;in 1987, when he was arrested for trying to sell stolen property,and this spring, when he was accused of being a bag man for aninternational drug ring.   After Zorza's April 6 arrest in Italy on the drug charge,published reports linked him to two of Italy's biggest postwarfinancial and political scandals: The collapse of Milan's BancoAmbrosiano and the right-wing ``P-2'' conspiracy to undermineItaly's constitutional government.   In a prison interview broadcast on the syndicated televisionprogram, ``A Current Affair,'' Zorza maintained his innocence. Hesaid he was guilty of drug charges only by ``association orinterpretation.''   But he admitted his ministry, such as it was, had failed.   ``I had all kinds of dreams ... and everything ... vanished,''he said in heavily accented English. ``The reason is, I could neverlean on anything that was organized. It's easy to drive a car on ahighway or to walk on a trail someone made, but when you have tomake your own trail, you don't know what's there.''   Zorza's odyssey began March 24, 1941, in a village in northernItaly near the Yugoslav border. The youngest of nine children, hebegan studying for the priesthood at age 11; at 24, he was ordained.   Zorza was assigned by the Consolatas to Somerset, where heimpressed other priests with his ambition and willingness to work.   ``The son of a gun is amazing,'' says Aiardi. ``If someone hadcar trouble in the middle of the night, he'd say, `I'll go gethim.' If you told him, `There's this family that needs a littlesomething,' he'd be the first one to jump in the truck and bring itto them.'''   But Zorza soon became restless, Aiardi says. In the mid-1970s hemoved out, saying he wanted to raise money for missionary friendsin Brazil.   ``I was taking a different direction,'' Zorza later explained.But a conversation secretly recorded in 1982 indicated it may havebeen a crooked one.   In a meeting with a journalist posing as a shady art dealer,Zorza's partner described the priest's Brazilian initiative as anopportunity for profit, not charity. ``You can make more money inthis than paintings,'' he promised.   Over the years, Zorza's fund-raising operations changed namesand locations, but ``it was never clear to us what he was doing,''recalls Aiardi. ``Even when I'd ask him personally, `Larry, whatthe heck are you doing?', he'd pass over it.''   Zorza, who had become an American citizen, became a volunteer atthe Vatican's mission to the United Nations in 1978. His role soonexpanded, although he was neither a diplomat nor a paid employee.By 1982 he was the fourth-ranking staffer.   As usual, Zorza was always available: Driving nuns to the store,representing the mission at Italian-American community functions,picking up officials at the airport.   He made contacts, including Francesco Pazienza, an Italianfinancier later charged in the Ambrosiano collapse and convicted inthe 1980 bombing of a Bologna train station which killed 85 people.   Europeo, an Italian magazine, says that Zorza, Pazienza and athird man offered $4.5 million for an island in the Caribbeannation of Antigua in order to create their own state, with stamps,currency and liberal tax laws. But the deal fell through whenAntigua refused to cede sovereignty over the island, the magazinesaid.   During this period Zorza lived in the rectory of St. AgnesChurch on East 43rd Street, one of the most prominent parishes inthe New York archdiocese. Although not officially on the staff, hesaid Mass, heard confessions and performed marriages. He boastedthat one of his most beloved parishioners was Greta Garbo.   But one of Zorza's new friends led him into a trap.   Peter Watson, the journalist posing as an art dealer, was toldZorza was a diplomat with contacts at airports in New York and Romewho would be willing to smuggle contraband art.   When they met, Watson _ who was working with the Customs Service_ asked Zorza if he had brought in much before. The priest nodded.   ``Small things are better,'' he told Watson. ``Jewelry is good;you have jewelry?''   When Watson asked, ``You have brought in jewelry?'' Zorzaanswered, ``Yes.''   After the meeting, Watson was told Zorza would carry twopaintings to New York from Rome for $8,000. A week later Zorzaarrived at Kennedy Airport. With Customs agents secretly watching,he declared only a bottle of wine, some books and family heirlooms.   When he was arrested the next day, Zorza fainted. En route tohis arraignment, he told a Customs agent, ``I have to say Mass at 5o'clock.''   Zorza pleaded guilty. But before sentencing, the priest'ssupporters deluged the prosecutor with phone calls, the judge withletters. A typical plea came from Thomas L. Cassidy, managingdirector of First Boston Corp., who wrote:   ``I know of no person who has a greater concern for his fellowman, to the detriment of his own personal interest. I cannotconceive of Father Zorza doing anything illegal or immoral.... ''</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
