Telephone: (202) 724-7179.(Part 71, Subpart B).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>In October 1986, Congress enacted theProgram Fraud Civil Remedies Act, Pub. L. 99-509, to establish a new administrativeprocedure as a remedy against those who knowingly make false claims orstatements. The statue requires specified Federal agencies to follow certainprocedures to recover penalties and assessments against persons who filefalse claims or statements. The statute provides for designated investigativeand reviewing officials, an administrative hearing process, and an agencyappeal procedure with limited judicial review. To facilitate the new processand promote uniformity in the Government, the President's Council on Intergrityand Efficiency distributed draft model regulations to its membership. InSubpart A of these proposed regulations, the Department of Justice, withminor variations, has adopted the model regulations set forth in the Council'sfinal draft. In keeping with the statute's requirements, the agency's proposedregulations provide that the Counsel, Office of Professional Responsibilityor a designee will act as the Investigating Official; the Associated AttorneyGeneral will serve as Reviewing Official; the General Counsel, JusticeManagement Division and bureau officials with similar responsibility willact for the Associate Attorney General in prosecuting claims; an administrativelaw judge will be the presiding official; and the Deputy Attorney Generalor his designee will act as Authority Head on appeals. The new administrativeprocess should enhance the Department's ability to deter fraud in thosecases where the costs of litigation in the past have exceeded the amountof recovery, thus making it uneconomical to pursue such claims. The statuteprovides for a jurisdictional limit of $150,000.00 and a maximum penaltyof $5,000.00 for each false claim or statement. The proposed regulationsshould provide the Department with an effective remedy against a personalleged to have submitted false claims or statements while providing dueprocess to that person.In Subpart B of these proposed regulations, the Assistant Attorney General,Civil Division, has been assigned the responsibility for the approval anddisapproval of requests by other agencies to initiate administrative actionsunder the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act of 1986. The proposed regulationsalso designate the Assistant Attorneys General for the litigating divisions(Antitrust, Civil, Civil Rights, Criminal, Land and Natural Resources,and Tax) to make the determinations called for by the Act in connectionwith a proceeding conducted by another agency when such proceeding mayadversely affect pending or potential criminal or civil action under theresponsibility of the litigating division. Finally, they designate theAssistant Attorney General, Civil Division, as the official responsiblefor decisions to initiate civil actions to collect or enforce any civilpenalty or assessment imposed by an agency under the Act, and to defendin litigation and/or to settle or compromise such liabilities at any timesubsequent to the filing of a petition for judicial review by the personupon whom the liability was imposed. Under the terms of the Act, these designations may not be further delegatedbelow the level of the Assistant Attorney General; they may, of course,be made by persons acting as Assistant Attorney General during the absenceof the incumbent or while the position is vacant. Similarly, while thedecision to initiate or compromise a collection action is reserved to theAssistant Attorney General for the Civil Division, the conduct of suchlitigation and negotiation of settlement proposals shall be handled byDivision attorneys or Assistant United States Attorneys subject to theAssistant Attorney General's supervision. These proposed rules do not constitute ``major rules'' within the meaningof Executive Order 12291, section 1(a). Nor do the requirements of theRegulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), apply. These proposed rulescontain no information collection or recordkeeping requirements as definedby the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1978, and fall within the exceptionsto coverage. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG>28 CFR Part 0 Claims, Fraud, Organization and function (government agencies). 28 CFR Part 71 Claims, Fraud, Organization and function (government agencies), Penalties.By virtue of the authority vested in me as Attorney General by 5 U.S.C.301 and 28 U.S.C. 509 and 510, I propose to amend Title 28 of the Codeof Federal Regulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 0_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1.
