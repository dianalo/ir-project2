Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah wrote to Peggy Say, sister ofAmerican hostage Terry Anderson, ``I hope your human suffering willend shortly and I promise to do all my best to help you.''   Anderson, 41, of Lorain, Ohio, was kidnapped March 16, 1985,while serving as chief Middle East correspondent for the TheAssociated Press.   He is the longest-held hostage in Lebanon among 15 Westerners,including nine Americans, three Britons, one Irishman, one Italianand a Belgian.   Fadlallah, 53, is the spiritual leader of the Iranian-backedHezbollah, or Party of God. It is made up of Shiite Moslemfundamentalists and is believed to be an umbrella group forunderground factions that have claimed the abduction of mostWesterners missing since 1985.   Mrs. Say, who is in Damascus to meet with Syrian officialscooperating in the effort to obtain the hostages' freedom, gavereporters here a copy of the message she received recently.   Fadlallah's letter, dated Dec. 31, said, ``We hope thegovernments involved will take into account the humanitarian aspectof the hostages issue and the grief of their relatives.   ``We, as religious people, will strive hard to solve this tragicproblem with respect for the good ties which link us to the Americanpeople.''   Syrian officials said they would arrange a meeting between Mrs.Say and Fadlallah, now in Iran, if he transits Damascus on his wayback to Lebanon.   ``We would like to emphasize that regardless of the rulers'interests, our relations with other peoples should be friendly andbased on good faith,'' Fadlallah said in his letter.   The religious leader, who has disavowed any responsibility forthe kidnappings, wrote in response to letters from Mrs. Say, theJournalists' Committee to Free Terry Anderson and other humanitarianand media groups in the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
