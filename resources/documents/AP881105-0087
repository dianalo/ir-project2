The prosecutors working for independent counsel Lawrence E. Walshhave been playing videotapes of the House-Senate hearings to thefederal grand jury that has been meeting regularly on the case forabout three weeks, said sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.   Because grand jury proceedings are secret, it is unclear whomight be suspected of lying under oath, either to Congress or to theoriginal Iran-Contra grand jury that returned indictments earlierthis year.   But the panel could compare testimony a witness gave to Congresswith facts developed by Walsh's investigation, as well as swornstatements that the individual or others made to the originalIran-Contra grand jury.   So far, the grand jury has not heard any live witnesses,according to the sources, indicating prosecutors are layinggroundwork for the investigation by playing the videotapes of the1987 hearings.   The grand jury has been meeting two or three times a week forseveral hours. It hears other cases unrelated to the Iran-Contraaffair.   The new grand jury, unlike the one that indicted former WhiteHouse aide Oliver L. North and other figures in the Iran-Contraaffair, is free to review congressional testimony given under grantsof limited immunity from prosecution for evidence of perjury.   Such grants of ``use immunity'' prohibit prosecutors from using awitness' testimony or evidence derived from it to prosecute thatindividual in court on criminal charges.   The immunized testimony, however, could be used as evidence in aperjury case if the witness lied to Congress or a grand jury.   It could also be used as evidence that another person committed acrime, raising the possibility the new panel could develop leadsfrom the congressional hearings that could not be followed up by theoriginal Iran-Contra grand jury.   Walsh and most of his prosecutors carefully isolated themselvesfrom news coverage of the House-Senate committee hearings to avoidexposure to the immunized congressional testimony.   The independent counsel did not want to be left open to defenseaccusations that his office illegally relied on the immunizedtestimony as evidence to prosecute the Iran-Contra defendants.   He also took measures to ensure that members of the originalIran-Contra grand jury were not exposed to immunized congressionaltestimony.   The team of prosecutors presenting evidence to the new grand juryis led by K. Chris Todd, one of the few members of Walsh's staff whohas been exposed to the congressional testimony.   Todd's appearance at the proceedings signaled that the newIran-Contra grand jury is reviewing immunized congressionaltestimony and that perjury is a likely subject of the inquiry.   Walsh said in court last spring that Todd had been exposed totestimony given to Congress and was not participating in theprosecution of North, former national security adviser John M.Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakim and Richard V. Secord.   But Walsh testified that Todd was continuing to do unspecifiedwork on his staff.   North, Poindexter, Hakim testified on Capitol Hill under limitedgrants of immunity from prosecution. They are accused of conspiringto defraud the government by diverting millions of dollars ofproceeds from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan rebels.   Secord, the fourth defendant in the case, gave congressionaltestimony without any immunity from prosecution.   No dates have been set for any of the four trials ordered in theIran-Contra conspiracy case.   Members of the House and Senate panels openly expressed doubtsabout credibility of some of the congressional witnesses, includingPoindexter.   In their recently published book ``Men of Zeal,'' two members ofthe committee, Sens. William Cohen, R-Maine, and George J. Mitchell,D-Maine, note that Poindexter ``said 184 times he could not recallevents about which he was questioned.''   The memory lapses by a Navy rear admiral known for his keenintellect ``raised serious questions about Poindexter'scredibility,'' the two senators wrote.   Walsh's staff would also be in a better position to evaluate thecongressional testimony that Secord and Hakim gave about secretSwiss bank accounts and dummy corporations through which the armsmoney flowed.   The congressional panels never saw the records of the secret bankaccounts, which Walsh only obtained after protracted legalproceedings in Swiss courts.   In addition, Walsh has the cooperation of Willard Zucker, anAmerican lawyer and financier whose Geneva company has handled manyof Hakim's business affairs for many years.   Unlike the defendants in the case, a number of figures in theIran-Contra affair testified both on Capitol Hill and before theoriginal Iran-Contra grand jury.   Walsh is not barred from using congressional testimony that wasnot given under immunity grants.   But his staff and the original grand jury generally avoidedexposure to accounts of the House-Senate proceedings so theywouldn't learn about the testimony of immunized witnesses fromquestions that were put to other witnesses.   But the new grand jury would be free to compare the differentversions of testimony by many witnesses who appeared before theoriginal Iran-Contra grand jury and on Capitol Hill.</TEXT></DOC>
