Previously we have shown thatthese can be related to those fulfilled by correlators of bilinear fieldstransforming according to G/sub L/ x G/sub R/, where G/sub L(R)/ aresemisimple Lie groups of the same dimension. Exploiting this relationwe show that the superconformal Ward identities of the supersymmetricWZW model can be obtained from bosonic ones by a single replacement ofone numerical parameter.</TEXT></DOC>
