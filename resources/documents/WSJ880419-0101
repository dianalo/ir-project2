The Shaumburg, Ill., chip maker said it signed an agreement with American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. to license the newest version of ATandamp;T's Unix operating system software, a program that controls the flow of data inside computers. Last fall, many computer companies expressed concern that ATandamp;T might grow more reticent to license the widely used operating system, in light of a technology-development agreement the former telephone monopoly signed with Sun Microsystems Inc., a computer maker that is promoting its own state-of-the-art microprocessor family.    Motorola said its new chips, based on a new technology called reduced-instruction-set computing, or RISC, are capable of performing 14 million to 17 million instructions a second. That performance rating is the highest available among microprocessors using conventional, so-called CMOS technology, Motorola said. It said it signed an agreement with Data General Corp. to develop special microprocessors using so-called ECL technology that will perform in excess of 100 million instructions a second. </TEXT></DOC>
