Similarly, because increased bond prices to a great extent offset reduced stock prices, October's stock-market crash did not deal spending all that severe a blow. In comforting us in this way, however, Prof. Friedman acquiesces in an error against which he customarily warns others -- to wit, thinking that because something is true for me and true for you, it must also be true for us.    Sure, were a good fairy to leave a million dollars' worth of stock under my pillow tonight, I would feel wealthier upon awakening. I might even want to spend more. If so, however, I first would have to alter the form that my wealth took. After all, few cashiers accept stock certificates; they generally insist upon money.    Go a step further. Could the good fairy's extending her generosity to everyone enable us all to spend more? How could it? No matter how wealthy we feel and no matter how much our wealth prompts us to spend, to spend we need money, and not one more dollar would exist tomorrow than exists today. Stocks are not money.    The spending stream actually might contract as a result of our feeling wealthier. We might want money balances larger than those we held before; and efforts to enlarge holdings of money, the medium of exchange, unavoidably shrink the flow of spending. (Opposite tendencies, tracing to interest-rate effects upon money balances demanded, also would be at work.)    Throw the exercise into reverse gear, and we see that even had October's crash extinguished wealth, the quantity of money would not have changed. The wealth effect, furthermore, would have tended to strengthen spending.    In failing to keep the distinction between money and wealth fully in mind, Prof. Friedman lost an opportunity to reiterate a point that he and Anna J. Schwartz stress in their &quot;A Monetary History of the United States&quot;: Stock-market crashes do not cause depressions; perverse monetary policy does.    Prof. Robert L. Greenfield   Fairleigh Dickinson University   Madison, N.J.    ---   Prof. Friedman misses the point when he argues that worry over the federal debt is misplaced. It's the opportunity cost of carrying the burgeoning debt, in addition to its proportion to the gross national product, that determines what society must forgo because of this debt.    In 1960 the ratio of debt to GNP was 46%, larger than the 1987 estimate of 37%. But the real interest rate on 10-year government securities was a modest 2.5% in 1960, compared with a gargantuan 8.6% in 1984 and a bloated 5% in 1986. The 100-plus percent increase in the opportunity cost of financing the federal debt is (and should be) of great concern.    Jonathan B.
