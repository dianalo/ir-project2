Do you think her changeof heart had anything to do with the newspaper story lastmonth that said the cops think I stashed $100,000 neverrecovered from my bank robbery?&quot;</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Ditch the greedy, conniving broad,&quot; replies Darby, theDear Abby of Texas prisons, &quot;and I'll fix you up with a sweetyoung thang for 50% of the loot.&quot;   In case it isn't clear yet, Dear Darby's resemblance tothe famous advice column ends just after the &quot;Dear.&quot; Hisreaders are among the 46,700 inmates of Texas' 35 stateprisons. In each issue of the Echo, the inmate-run monthlypaper for the state's prisoners, Darby gives advice oneverything from cellmates who don't shower to thedisappearance of Kellogg's Frosted Flakes from the messhalls. But, as one might expect in this hard-bittenenvironment, Darby doesn't coddle readers with warm-and-fuzzypsychobabble.   &quot;Write back after you get a decade or so under your belt,&quot;Darby advises one young convict. &quot;Meanwhile, try to find acon like Darby to emulate. And get somebody to look upemulate for you in the dictionary. It's the big book with allthe words and no plot.&quot;   Those are fighting words in a prison system once known asthe nation's toughest. At times, Texas inmates killed moreinmates than state executioners did.   That era is past, but the joint is still no tea party,especially for someone who belittles his fellow felons as&quot;jerks and losers&quot; and tells them to &quot;put a lid on thesniveling.&quot; That's why Darby's identity is known just to afew officials and inmate confidants.   Despite the derisive tone of much of Darby's writing, thecolumn strikes a responsive chord with inmates. Dear Darbyranks among their favorite Echo features, according to prisonofficials who sometimes do informal market surveys. (Theyhave the market locked up.) The other inmate favorite? Thelegal advice column.   Darby &quot;inspires loyalty, kind of like the Ann Landersthing,&quot; says Austin newsman Jorge Renaud, who wrote for theEcho while doing a sentence. &quot;He was able to tear through thebull in the prison system.&quot;   Mr. Renaud, who says he still doesn't know Darby'sidentity, understands the columnist's desire for anonymity.&quot;I published a poem about prison gangs and got three deaththreats,&quot; he says.   The column certainly stands out in the Echo, an otherwiseroutine prison paper relying on a captive readership. Whilemost newspapers try to stimulate thought and debate, prisonpapers don't want to stimulate anything. As the Echo notesprominently in its masthead, it's &quot;a monthly censoredpublication,&quot; and its pages reflect that. Most items areuncritical reports of prison policies, visiting speakers orentertainers. There also are short stories and poetry byinmates and -- another big house favorite -- a list of goodsfor sale in prison commissaries.   &quot;In a publication that's basically a house organ, he's arebel,&quot; Darby says of himself. &quot;He's the irreverent smartaleck who gets away with saying things publicly, poking funat convicts themselves as well as the criminal justicesystem.&quot;   The current Darby is the latest in a series ofpseudonymous authors of the column, which has served readersfor at least 20 years. &quot;Darby's kind of like Lassie,&quot; saysprison spokesman David Nunnelee. &quot;There's been more thanone.&quot;   Prison spokesmen and Darby say they don't know how thecolumn got started, and stories marking the 60-yearanniversary of the Echo in 1988 don't mention it, focusinginstead on the earliest staff members (including two inmateswho escaped after whacking a guard on the head with a malletused in typesetting).   The current Darby wrote for newspapers &quot;in the world,&quot; asinmates describe what's beyond the red-brick prison walls, sosubmitting stories to the Echo came naturally. In time, hebroke his way into the Darby job.   He has been dishing out his acerbic advice for five years-- and he may do so for quite a few more. Fearful of exposinghis identity, he won't discuss his sentence or why he's inprison. He has served 15 years in maximum security and triesfor parole were denied due to the nature of his offense. Aveteran state prosecutor says only a few violent crimes --like murder, aggravated rape and kidnapping -- would qualifyfor such time.   It's hard to connect these crimes with the &quot;40-ish&quot; manwho writes the Darby feature on an Apple computer in the Echonewsroom. The prison slang that peppers the column belies theauthor's college degree from a state university. That putshis education well ahead of most inmates, whose averageschooling hasn't gone past the sixth grade. In an interviewconducted through a heavy glass-and-wire screen, he is wry,informed and, well, gentle. &quot;Darby,&quot; he says simply, &quot;is myalter ego.&quot;   But sometimes that alter ego reveals a deep-seated angeramid the gibes. It's hard to keep from lashing out at inmateswho are wasting their lives, Darby says. &quot;A two-time loser atage 23 doing his days in lockup?&quot; Darby asks an inmate whowrote from solitary confinement to praise the columnist.&quot;Your opinions are about as worthwhile as Saddam Hussein's. .. . Get a life, chump.&quot;   Darby picks the letters he wants to answer after they'repassed on by prison officials. The same topics come up yearafter year, led by &quot;relationships with people in the world --wives, children, girlfriends,&quot; Darby says. So he looks forunusual problems, or letters just pleading for a snappyreply. It's a challenge, he says: &quot;This is not a veryhumorous environment, when you get right down to it.&quot;   But in reply to a reader with a cockroach problem, Darbywrote: &quot;you might try setting up a small recreation area inyour cell for the roaches. My cellie and I have built themtheir own little rec yard, under his bunk, back in thedarkest corner of our house. A couple of empty sardine cans,a damp box of snack crackers and a moldy cheese container isjust like a trip to Six Flags for these little brown denizensof the dark. We haven't gotten rid of the roaches, but atleast we know where to find them.&quot;   Officials who screen the Echo say they rarely edit Darby'scolumn. But in the pen, there's no free press -- some lettersand answers are barred. Anything that may agitate inmates isa no-no, as are letters dealing with death, says oneofficial.   Like his advice-columnist counterparts in the world, Darbyinsists that the letters he answers are real. &quot;I don't haveto make them up,&quot; he says. &quot;If there's something specific Iwant to write about, somebody will give me the opportunity.&quot;   Some would say Darby is mostly interested in deliveringwicked shots. Consider his 1986 response to the grieving&quot;Star,&quot; who was cross about his release, set for thatDecember:   &quot;You see, Darby, it's like this. Me and my cellie Peacheshave lived together for a long time. But Peaches won't getout before the end of next year. We're real close, Darby, andI just can't imagine who will take care of Peaches after I'mgone. You have any suggestions?&quot;   &quot;Stop worrying,&quot; advises Darby. &quot;You can bet your firstfree-world paycheck that someone will be taking care oflittle Peaches before you are on the bus out of Huntsville.With regard to your not wanting to leave here, your porchlight is on, but nobody's home.&quot;   Next letter: &quot;Dear Darby, Last week I asked the major tofind a decent cellie, but he talked real crazy to me. Said hedidn't care about me having 90 years aggravated time. Thisnext 19 1/2 years is going to drive me crazy. What can I doto make this time easier?&quot;   &quot;Dear Butch,&quot; replies Darby. &quot;Check with Peaches inDecember.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
