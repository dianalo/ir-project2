The flap over whether one or more West German companies helpedbuild the Libyan factory has driven another wedge into a wideningrift between Washington and Bonn. Relations between the steadfastallies was tested last year by lethal crashes of NATO airplanes onWest Germany territory and U.S. insistence on continuing low-leveltraining flights there.   In one of the sharpest public exchanges between the two countriesin recent years, West German politicians and news commentatorssingled out the U.S. news media for their reports on the Libyanplant dispute.   The New York Times and U.S. News andamp; World Report last weekenddisclosed allegations that West German, Italian and Japanesecompanies helped build the Libyan plant about 60 miles southwest ofTripoli.   Libya says it is used to make pharmaceuticals, but Washingtonsays it is a chemical weapons plant. President Reagan has saidmilitary action against the plant is an option.   Kohl stepped into the fray on Friday when his spokesman told anews conference that the U.S. treatment of the affair, especiallythe way the news media has handled it, had ``not been useful.''   ``Chancellor Helmut Kohl has let Washington know this by theappropriate means,'' spokesman Friedhelm Ost added. Ost declined todisclose the contents of the message, which he characterized as``urgent and friendly.''   West German officials said Thursday they had found no evidence ofillegal exports by one company, Imhausen-Chemie of Lahr. They alsosaid there is no proof that the plant is designed to producechemical weapons.   However, France, Canada and Egypt joined Friday in supportingU.S. contentions about the plant.   U.S. officials, including Secretary of State George Shultz, havesharply and publicly criticized Bonn for what they describe asfoot-dragging in checking into whether any West Germany companieshelped build the plant.   But Ost on Friday repeated the West German government's claimthat Washington had failed to respond to Bonn's request for furtherconcrete information.   ``The Federal Republic (West Germany) as a nation of laws cannotoperate on the basis of suppositions and suspicion,'' Ost said. ``Idon't want to make any speculation about the possible motivation forthe campaign by a section of the U.S. news media.''   Kohl told Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher to take up theissue with Shultz at an international conference on chemical weaponsthat begins Saturday in Paris, Ost said.   West German newspapers on Friday carried reports on the growingtensions between the two countries and the counterattack led byVolker Ruehe, a top-ranking official in Kohl's Christian DemocraticUnion.   Late Thursday night, the ZDF television network, the nation'ssecond largest TV network, ran a lengthy news report on thecontroversy. Moderator Peter Voss said the harshest allegations werepublished in The New York Times, which he described as a``traditional defender of Jewish interests.''   The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in Frankfurt reported thatRuehe suggested closing the Goethe Institute facilities in theUnited States if the U.S. news media persist in their ``campaign ''against West Germany. The Goethe Institute, with offices worldwide,offers German language instruction and cultural programs.   ``It was correct to sound the alarm,'' Ruehe told The AssociatedPress in a telephone interview Friday. He singled out for specialcriticism a New York Times column, which he said had characterizedthe affair as West German aid helping Libya to build an``Auschwitz-in-the sand.''   The Auschwitz concentration camp, with its gas chambers, was oneof the most notorious death camps of Nazi Germany. From 1940-45,about 4 million people, mostly Jews, died there.</TEXT></DOC>
