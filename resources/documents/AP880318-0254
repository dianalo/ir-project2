A headline in Barricada, the Sandinista newspaper, said: ``TheOrder Of The Day: Intensify Combat.''   Honduras said the raids Thursday were confined to its ownterritory, aimed at Nicaraguan soldiers it said crossed thefrontier the day before in pursuit of rebels known as Contras.   Reagan administration officials said a Nicaraguan helicopter wasdestroyed in the raid, but Nicaragua denied it.   However, a Defense Ministry spokesman said Friday that rebelanti-aircraft fire hit a Sandinista helicopter Thursday near SanAndres de Bocay, the region bombed by Honduras. He did not notelaborate.   Later Friday, Maj. Rosa Pasos, the chief Defense Ministryspokeswoman, called The Associated Press to deny any helicopter hadbeen hit in the region.   The Sandinista government continued with plans for cease-firetalks with the Contras next Monday, but the U.S.-supported rebelswere considering a boycott.   Cease-fires in the region's civil wars, and a ban on the use ofone country's territory for attacks on another, are provisions ofthe peace plan signed Aug. 7 by the five Central Americanpresidents.   Nicaragua said it had called off its offensive to drive Contrasfrom camps along the Honduran border Wednesday but was maintainingcombat positions.   Although the Defense Ministry said none of the soldiers enteredHonduras, a Nicaraguan military source indicated privately thatthey had.   Honduran officials and the Reagan administration say Sandinistasoldiers crossed the rugged, ill-defined border about 175 milesfrom Managua.   On Thursday, the United States started flying 3,200 soldiers ofthe 82nd Airborne Division and 7th Light Infantry to Honduras in ashow of support. Defense Secretary said they would be on a trainingexercise there for 10 days but would stay out of combat.   President Daniel Ortega said Nicaraguan troops would take on theAmericans if necessary.   He hedged the question of whether Nicaraguan soldiers crossedthe Coco River in the isolated northern region, as he has whenprevious incursions were reported.   ``Here the question is not if army troops penetrated Honduranterritory or not, but that we have dozens of camps of mercenaryforces in Honduran territory ... tolerated by the Hondurangovernment,'' he said Thursday.   Journalists taken to the area earlier Thursday saw and felt abomb explode at the confluence of the Bocay and Coco rivers. Lt.Col. Javier Carrion, commander of the offensive against theContras, said two bombs fell in Nicaraguan territory and one on theHonduran side.   Carrion told reporters in a jungle clearing at San Andres deBocay that 4,500 soldiers were involved in the sweep through anarea running from central Nicaragua to the frontier. He said theyhad air support from Soviet-supplied helicopter gunships and An-26propeller-driven planes carrying bombs.   He said Sandinista troops had killed 92 Contras and wounded 300,at the cost of 34 soldiers dead and 68 wounded.   The colonel said the purpose was to destroy Contra bases in theborder area, which is about 40 miles from an important miningregion the rebels attacked in December.   The Defense Ministry said 17 soldiers and 15 rebels were killedbetween Tuesday and Friday in fighting in the central province ofMatagalpa, in Zelaya on the Caribbean coast and Jinotega, where SanAndres de Bocay is located.   Civilian sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity forsecurity reasons, said 17 soldiers were killed and eight wounded intwo clashes Friday in the central province of Chontales. Six rebelswere killed, they said.   Honduras said about 2,000 Nicaraguan soldiers crossed theborder, and a high-ranking military officer said about half of themstill were there Friday.</TEXT></DOC>
