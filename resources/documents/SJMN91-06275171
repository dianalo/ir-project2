That's how we dealt withthe so-called ethnic problems in the Soviet Union -- we ignored them.;   &quot;It'smuch better that these children will know the truth,&quot; she said. &quot;Ukrainianchildren will understand Jewish children better than their parents did becausethey will know about the historic abasement of the Jews.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Los Angeles Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Kiev, Ussr  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911001  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  443  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday, October 1, 199100275171,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
