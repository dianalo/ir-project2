Unfortunately, the largehinge moments often associated with these vehicles have prevented theirapplication. A procedure is presented for the efficient design of a variable-bendgeometry vehicle given a set of system constraints. In particular, theselection of vehicle parameters to produce minimum hinge moments fortrimmed flight is examined in detail. 20 refs., 19 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
