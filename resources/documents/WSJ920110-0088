After all, themovie purports to tell the story of the murder of a presidentof the United States. What responsibility does a film makerhave to the facts? Is even a virtuoso film maker justified inraiding history for his own purposes as if he wereShakespeare ransacking Holinshed's &quot;Chronicles&quot;? Is hejustified in weaving fact, conjecture and fiction into anindecipherable mass posing as a bold, quasi-authoritative,historical narrative?   Let me say that Oliver Stone's premise in &quot;JFK&quot; is farfrom unreasonable. It is that in 1963 President Kennedy beganto move toward the liquidation of the Cold War. Kennedy'sAmerican University speech that June called for an end to the&quot;vicious and dangerous cycle in which suspicion on one sidebreeds suspicion on the other, and new weapons begetcounterweapons.&quot; He asked Americans to &quot;re-examine our ownattitude -- as individuals and as a nation -- for ourattitude is as essential as theirs.&quot; He followed this speechby the negotiation of a test-ban treaty with the Soviet Union-- an action he regarded as only a first step.   In addition (and Oliver Stone could have strengthened hiscase by mentioning it) President Kennedy authorized UnitedNations Ambassador William Attwood to explore the possiblerestoration of relations with Castro's Cuba. &quot;The presidentgave him the go-ahead,&quot; Robert Kennedy said the next year,&quot;and he was to go to Havana . . . and see what could be done{to effect} a normalization of relationship.&quot;   Mr. Stone rests his case primarily on Vietnam. No one cansay what President Kennedy might eventually have done aboutVietnam. But there is strong documentary evidence as to hislong-run purpose. From the beginning to end of hisadministration, he steadily opposed repeated militaryrecommendations that he introduce an American expeditionaryforce. Having watched the French army fail in Vietnam in1951, he had no desire to send the American Army into thesame quagmire. &quot;The last thing he wanted,&quot; said Gen. MaxwellTaylor, &quot;was to put in our ground forces.&quot;   In the hope of enabling the South Vietnamese to savethemselves, President Kennedy did agree to modest increasesin the number of U.S. military advisers assigned to the SouthVietnamese army. But, as Roswell Gilpatric, the deputysecretary of defense, said later, &quot;Resistance was encounteredfrom the president at every stage as this total amount ofU.S. personnel deployment increased.&quot;   In July 1962 President Kennedy instructed Robert McNamara,the secretary of defense, to start planning for the phasedwithdrawal of the American advisers. The target date forcomplete disengagement was the end of 1965. The militaryproduced an acceptable plan in May 1963. Mr. Gilpatric latersaid, &quot;McNamara indicated to me that this was part of a planthe president asked him to develop to unwind the wholething.&quot;   President Kennedy's doubts about Vietnam were strengthenedby Mike Mansfield, then Senate majority leader, once aprofessor of Far Eastern history, later ambassador to Japan.The president sent Sen. Mansfield to take a look at Vietnamin 1962 (as Franklin Roosevelt had sent Mr. Mansfield to takea look at Nationalist China in 1944). Sen. Mansfieldrecommended that the Americans pull out. President Kennedysubsequently told Sen. Mansfield that total withdrawal wasthe right course, but he could not do it until after the 1964election. Otherwise, he feared, the Republicans might beathim in 1964 over the &quot;loss&quot; of Indochina as they had beatenthe Democrats in 1952 over the &quot;loss&quot; of China.   But President Kennedy went quietly ahead with the firstphase of withdrawal. In October 1963 he ordered the return of1,000 advisers. Then came Dallas. President Johnson,listening to President Kennedy's more hawkish advisers andbelieving he was doing what President Kennedy would havedone, issued National Security Action Memorandum 273 callingfor the maintenance of American military programs in Vietnam&quot;at levels as high&quot; as before -- reversing the Kennedywithdrawal policy. On March 27, 1964, President Johnsoncanceled President Kennedy's phased-withdrawal plan. In early1965 he ordered in American ground forces.   So Oliver Stone's film has a defensible premise. But theconclusion he draws is indefensible. It is that, outraged byPresident Kennedy's policy of winding down the Cold War, acabal of evil men in high government positions organized agreat conspiracy based on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the CIA,the FBI, the military-industrial complex, anti-Castro Cubans,the mob and Lyndon B. Johnson for the purpose of murderingthe president and covering up the deed. Serious conspiracyarguments can be made; but the conspiracy theory in &quot;JFK&quot; isreckless, paranoid, really despicable fantasy, reminiscent ofthe wilder accusations of Joe McCarthy.   How much need we worry about the impact of &quot;JFK&quot;? Mr.Stone himself has equated history with &quot;Rashomon.&quot; &quot;JFK,&quot; hesuggests, is merely an exploration of &quot;possible scenarios ofwho killed Kennedy and why.&quot; Unfortunately his explosivestyle defeats the idea of the film as a judicious analysis ofalternative theories.   Still, the paranoid thriller is a form that carries theseeds of its own disbelief. Nothing is more ludicrous in&quot;JFK&quot; than the scene in which Major X explains to JimGarrison with the serene lucidity of a madman how the evilcabal is running and ruining the U.S.   Critics have expressed concern that young people for whomthe Kennedy assassination is history as remote as the sinkingof the Maine was to my generation will suppose &quot;JFK&quot; to bethe literal truth. Maybe some will. But I would think thatmost have seen so much hyped-up speculation, surmise andinvention in docudramas that they take thesepseudo-historical exposures &quot;cum grano salis.&quot;   Still, for a people that prides itself on robust commonsense, Americans have shown from the start an uncommonsusceptibility to conspiracy theory. We've gone throughpanics over plots allegedly hatched by the BavarianIlluminati, the Masonic Order, the Catholic Church, the slavepower, the abolitionists, the international bankers, theanarchists, the Elders of Zion, the Comintern. HistorianRichard Hofstadter wrote memorably about &quot;The Paranoid Stylein American Politics.&quot;   Of course, as the saying goes, even paranoids may havereal enemies. The more enduring residue of &quot;JFK&quot; will be thequestions the film raises about the adequacy of the WarrenCommission inquiry. These questions are legitimate. There isno reason to regard the Warren Commission report as sacred.We now know that both the CIA and the FBI withheld vitalinformation from the commission. I think these agencieswithheld the information for reasons of bureaucraticself-protection; but, whatever the motive, the result was aninadequate investigation.   Whether a more adequate investigation would have produceda different conclusion is a separate question, on which Iremain agnostic. A powerful case can be made against thetheory that the same bullet struck both President Kennedy andGov. John Connally. This argues for a second gunman. &quot;JFK&quot;both makes that case and impairs it, since the viewer cannever tell at any point in the movie where fact ends andfiction begins.   I find it difficult to exclude the conspiracy theory -- orto accept it. Were the bumblers of the Dallas PoliceDepartment in the great conspiracy? the hospital's medicalstaff? the Secret Service? How far did the conspiracy extend?The wider the conspiracy, the more likely in thispublicity-mad age that some survivor on the conspiracy'sfringe would sell his memoirs to People magazine for $10million. Nothing like this has yet happened.   Robert Kennedy had his doubts about the Warren Commission.On Oct. 30, 1966, as we talked till 2:30 a.m. in P.J.Clarke's saloon in New York, he wondered how long he couldcontinue to avoid comment on the report. He regarded it as apoor job but was unwilling to criticize it and thereby reopenthe whole tragic business.   The next year Oliver Stone's hero Jim Garrison startedmaking his sensational charges. RFK told me that he thoughtGarrison might be on to something. NBC, he said, was sendingWalter Sheridan, a trusted investigator who had worked withhim on the Jimmy Hoffa case, to New Orleans to find out whatMr. Garrison had. Robert Kennedy said to me some weeks later,&quot;Sheridan is satisfied that Garrison is a fraud.&quot;   When I told this story to Oliver Stone, he replied rathersharply that Mr. Sheridan had come to New Orleans with hismind made up, almost implying that Mr. Sheridan too was partof the conspiracy. Conspiracy theory makes it dangerouslyeasy to explain away all objections.   Mr. Stone is an earnest, appealing man. He fought bravelyfor his country in the horror of Vietnam. He has earned theright to brood and agonize over the reasons he and so manyothers were sent to kill and die in that war. He is anartist, and artists are often hopelessly loyal to theirfantasies -- and their fantasies often hopelessly abuse thetruth. History will survive.   ---   Mr. Schlesinger, a professor at the City University of NewYork, is the winner of two Pulitzer Prizes, including one for&quot;A Thousand Days,&quot; on President Kennedy.</TEXT></DOC>
