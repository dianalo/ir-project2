The paper treats the theoretic relations with a mathematicalmodel for determining the extinction coefficient of the solar radiationin gas suspension of micro particles of various sizes. A descriptionof the procedure for acquiring pyrolitic micro particles from acetyleneand the results of the extinction test on gas suspension, with simulatedsolar radiation, are included.</TEXT></DOC>
