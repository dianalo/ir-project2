We report neutron irradiation experimentson sputtered NbN films, up to a fluence of 10{sup 23} m{sup {minus}2}(E andgt; 0.1 MeV, which prove that NbN films are also extremely radiation-hardhigh-field superconductors. Both the transition temperatures, T{sub c},and the normal state resistivities show only small changes with neutronfluence. Concerning the critical current densities j{sub c}, degradationsby as much as 30% are observed at low fields, whereas in an intermediatefield range (11--15 T) virtually no change of j{sub c} and at high fieldsnear 20 T even an increase of j{sub c} are found. The latter observationis ascribed to a radiation-induced increase of the upper critical field,B{sub c2}, and to the occurrence of peak effects near B{sub c2}. 14 refs.,6 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
