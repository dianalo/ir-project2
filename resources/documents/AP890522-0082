In the past year, officials of these groups say, contributionsto the National Audubon Society rose 50 percent, the rate ofmembership growth at the Wilderness Society doubled and theNational Wildlife Federation added 700,000 new members.   ``We're in the ironic situation where possibly the nation'sgreatest environmental catastrophe ever is causing this increasedinterest in environmental organizations,'' Audubon spokesman RobertSanGeorge said. ``It's a paradox.''   Although the March 24 oil spill is the most dramatic of therecent events fueling the movement's growth, it is not the onlyone. Environmentalists also cite last summer's East Coast beachpollution and reports suggesting that air pollution is changing theEarth's climate.   The oil spill, said Fred Krupp, executive director of theEnvironmental Defense Fund, ``has been an important event in aseries of important events that have heightened public interest.''   Although the environmentalists insist they aren't gloating overExxon's misfortune, they also can't hide a sense of vindication.   ``This spill has just really presented an opportunity,'' saidLee Keller Reis, a spokeswoman for the National WildlifeFederation. ``You hate to say, `We told you so,' but it's a way tomake a point.''   It is also a way to raise money. Several groups were quick totake advantage of the spill by sending out direct mail appeals forcontributions.   The National Wildlife Federation, the nation's largestenvironmental group with more than 5.8 million members, establishedan Alaska Fund immediately after the disaster and asked members forcontributions.   So far, $400,000 has been collected, Ms. Reis said. She said thefund will pay for research on the effects of the spill and forlobbying against oil drilling in the Arctic National WildlifeRefuge, among other things.   A mailing sent out by the Defenders of Wildlife was thatorganization's most successful ever, according to Carol Waite, thegroup's development director.   Defenders of Wildlife, which has 80,000 members, got $200,000 inresponse to the plea, Ms. Waite said. One woman sent in anunsolicited donation of about $1,000 in Exxon stock.   ``I think that was just indicative of how angry people are overthis devastation,'' Ms. Waite said.   Another group, the 285,000-member Wilderness Society, hasn'tsent out an appeal for contributions related to the oil spill buthas received about $50,000 in unsolicited funds, according toRebecca Wodder, vice president for membership and development.   Other groups, such as the National Audubon Society, said it wastoo early to assess the impact of the oil spill on membership orcontributions. Audubon hasn't yet gauged the response to a plea forfunds that it recently sent to 320,000 households around thenation, SanGeorge said.   Greenpeace estimates that it has been adding members at a rateof 50,000 a month since autumn and now has 1.35 million members.The Environmental Defense Fund's membership has more than doubledin the last 18 months, and now stands at more than 100,000,according to Krupp.   But Krupp and some of his colleagues are wary of the apparentchange in public attitude.   ``The fundamental lesson of environmental politics is that thepublic's interest in gains doesn't always translate into workablesolutions,'' Krupp said.   For instance, he said, last summer's beach pollution with sewageand medical waste prompted legislation that stiffened penalties forpolluters, but did little to reduce the sources of pollution.   ``The spotlight is now focused on environmental organizations,''Krupp said. ``It's both a great opportunity and also a challenge.As environmentalists, we need to make sure that this supporttranslates into real gains and not just proclamations.''</TEXT></DOC>
