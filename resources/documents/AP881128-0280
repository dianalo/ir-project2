Manville sought protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of theU.S. bankruptcy law Aug. 26, 1982, saying it faced ruin frombillions of dollars in suits claiming health problems from asbestosonce produced by the company.   Its refuge in bankruptcy court marked one of the biggest and mostexhaustive filings in U.S. history and raised major questions aboutuse of the federal bankruptcy laws to defer or avoid health-relatedliability claims.   Manville helped lay the precedent for another major company, A.H.Robins andamp; Co., to seek Chapter 11 protection when it felt threatenedby billions of dollars in escalating health claims for anow-discontinued controversial product, the Dalkon Shieldintrauterine birth-control device.   The Manville bankruptcy contributed to the company's tarnishedimage over the handling of asbestos claims, and some surveys calledit one of the least admired U.S. businesses.   Before its Chapter 11 filing, property damage claims alone hadcome to $85 billion, or about 40 times the company's total assets.Manville also faced more than 17,000 personal injury claims in thebillions of dollars.   The filing allowed Manville to operate shielded from liabilitysuits while it worked out a way to pay the bills. It also allowedthe company time to draft a $2.5 billion trust-fund plan to payasbestos victims.   Manville's reorganization plan was approved by the bankruptcycourt in December 1986. Following several appeals, the final orderimplementing the plan was given Oct. 28, to become effective in 30days.   The plan has been both praised and condemned.   Manville shareholders will be the big losers, winding up with oneshare of new Manville stock for every eight shares they once held,said Calvert Crary, a litigation analyst with Martin Simpson andamp; Co.,a New York investment research firm.   ``Basically, they wiped out their shareholders. I'm disgustedwith the way Manville conducted itself,'' Crary said recently. Heaccused Manville of ``gross abdication of fiduciary responsibilityto shareholders.''   But Stephens, who took control of the company a few years ago andis widely credited with helping steer it through the final stages ofbankruptcy, said the plan protects shareholders by restoring thecompany's financial health while at the same time addressing theasbestos claims problem.   The reorganization plan established a Personal Injury SettlementTrust to settle claims of asbestos health victims for the next 25years. Manville paid $150 million into the trust and its insurerswill add $615 million. Beginning in 1991, Manville will make annualpayments to the trust of $75 million until 2012.   A second trust, called the Property Damage Settlement Trust,would settle asbestos-related property claims. Manville paid $100million cash into it and the company's insurance carriers also willcontribute millions of dollars.   Manville also faces immediate cash obligations of $247.5 millionto commercial creditors.   Manville said that as of the close of business Monday, trading ofits old securities ceased. The new securities will trade under thesymbol MVL.   Manville reported a $164 million profit on $2.06 billion in saleslast year.   Today, the business consists of three parts: a fiberglass group,which produces insulation products and glass fibers; a forest group,producing wood and paper items; and a specialty products gorup,making goods ranging from commercial-industrial lighting to filtermaterials for the beer and wine industries.   Founded in 1858 as Johns-Manville Corp., the firm was built intoan industry leader in the early 1900s as a manufacturer of asbestos,the fibrous mineral once heavily used in insulation and fireproofingmaterials. It was incorporated under the shortened name in 1981.   The company's troubles began in the early 1970s when asbestos waslinked to a number of serious, often fatal diseases, including lungcancer and asbestosis.</TEXT></DOC>
