The jets had been scheduled for delivery between April 1989 and June 1990, but the state-owned domestic carrier is delaying delivery because it expects a planned deregulation of the Australian airline industry to hurt earnings. The government is considering the sale of shares in the carrier, which would further squeeze profit. Australian Air can reschedule delivery during the 1990s.    Japan's Finance Ministry is considering a mid-December sale of its remaining 34.5% of JAPAN AIR LINES and may sell the 48 million shares at a discount of 3.5% to the airline's closing price the day before the sale. Such a procedure would resemble that for the sale of 1,950,000 shares of Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone Corp., scheduled for early November. Last month, parliament approved the sale of the JAL stake. </TEXT></DOC>
