 Typically, ascanner is used within a DTP system for inputting images that are laterincluded in the DTP document.andM;The increased capabilities of scanners, together with reduced prices, havemade them more accessible, but with this has arisen the problem of selectingthe right scanner for your own particular requirements.andP;  I will address someof the more important aspects you should consider when selecting a scannerfor your DTP system as well as providing an outline of how the differentscanner packages work.andM;Choosing a scanner is no different from choosing any other piece of computerequipment and should be undertaken with the same care and consideration.andP;  Agood way to analuse your needs is to produce a five-column chart (see Figure1), which describes, in a structured form, the various contents of a samplenewsletter.andM;List your requirementsandM;The first task is to make a list of what your requirements are for input andwhere that input comes from.andP;  For each category of document produced, or tobe produced, you should write down what is required for the production ofthat category, together with other desirable features for the document.andO;These items fo in the first two columns of your chart.andP;  This will be the rootof the decision process and care should be taken to ensure that all thepossible items are included.andM;Examine each category of document in detail and produce a list that containsthe different elements of each document.andP;  The list will contain entries suchas body text, headlines, colour images, grey scale images, black and whiteimages, drawings, company logo, tables, equations and special effects,together with some items unique to your own documents.andM;Once you have this list, it needs to be extended to include details of wherethe item comes from, its size, and how often it is used and changed.andP;  Again,care is required to correctly identify these and so ensure an accuraterepresentation.andP;  To do this, check such things as the source of the text,images, drawings and logos received, because quite often arrive as hard copyeven if they are already available electronically.andM;The size of the item and the number of items used in each document, togetherwith how often items change, are important for determining the overall scopeof the task.andP;  Figure 1 shows a completed sample chart showing how thedifferent entries could be made.andP;  The nomenclature used will depend on thetypes of documents you are producing but should remain consistent across allthe categories.andM;Once the table is completed, it is a relatively easy task to see which itemsare already available in electronic form and which need to be converted.andO;Look for candidates (such as the graphs in Figure 1) where the implementationof a spreadsheet or database package would improve the overall efficiency andalso provide the input required.andP;  It may be possible to change theorigination method to receive items in electronic form, but there will alwaysbe certain items that are not available electronically, and so the need touse scanning.andM;The quantity, quality and type of scanning required will dictate the mostco-effective approach to meet your needs.andP;  The questions you have to ask noware which scanner systems match up to the requirements and desiresestablished with the table.andM;If there are quantities of text to be input then using Intelligent CharacterRecognition (ICR) and its greater accuracy would be of benefit, although forsome application Optical Character Recognition (OCR) may be a substitute.andP;  Ifyou need to include images, ensure that you have the capabilities forsufficient grey scales for your output needs together with a suitableresolution.andP;  Most grey scale scanners will now support 300 dots per inch(dpi) and 256 grey scales, so this should not be a problem.andP;  If you need toscan in diagrams and plans, you'll need to find a scanner that provides goodbi-tone levels and software that will convert this line art into filed foryour favorite editing program.andM;The size of input and its layout are the next things to consider, because thetext could be in multiple columns, parts of columns, and images and textcould be at any angle.andP;  Some scanning systems do not provide the facilitiesto handle  different page layouts or to only scan small parts of thedocument.andP;  As with all the other features, the trade-off of what is importantagainst the cost is something that has to be decided in relation to theamount of use that will be made of each feature.andM;When looking for a scanner, the best process is to select three or four thatappear to meet your needs from the brochures and then arrange for ademonstration.andP;  Explain to the person doing the demonstration what you intendto do with the results and provide a selection of the items you will want toscan.andP;  Once they have been scanned, take the results away with you andinclude the files in your DTP system to see what the end result is.andP;  Ifeverything is alright, you can select a scanner that meets your requirements;if all is not alright, the decision is more difficult and comes back to whattrade-offs you can make.andM;As part of the selection process it is worth considering a printer or aspecialist scanning bureau in the local high street for some or all of yourscanning needs.andP;  They are usually able to provide a range of both text andgraphic scanning services at reasonable prices and may provide a viablealternative solution.andM;Evaluating a scannerandM;When examining a scanner package, there are two essential aspects toconsider.andP;  The first is the physical characteristics of the scanner hardware;the second is the features provided by the software that accompanies thescanner.andM;In the more common systems, the scanner hardware controls such items asresolution, number of grey scales and the scanning mechanism, while thePC-based software controls such items as OCR, ICR, editing and cropping.andO;However, recent developments have seen this distinction become blurred as thescanning hardware takes on some of the tasks previously performed by the PCsoftware.andM;Scanning mechanismandM;The three different basic approaches to the mechanics of scanning an imageare flatbed, roll-feed and hand-held, with each having its own strengths andweaknesses.andM;The flatbed scanner is very similar to a photocopier in operation; thedocument is placed on a glass surface and the scanning head moves across thedocument.andP;  the roll-feed scanner is very similar to a facsimile; the documentis placed in an input tray and pulled across the scanning head, which remainsstationary.andP;  The hand-held scanner is operated by manually moving thescanning head across a document.andM;The different approaches tends to make the scanners suitable for differentapplications.andP;  Where a large number of sheets needs to be scanned, aroll-feed scanner is probably the answer, although they have similar problemsto facsimiles and occasionally twist the paper and jam.andM;Flatbed scanners are unsuitable for handling large quantities of documentsand suffer from the problem that care is required when positioning thedocuments.andP;  Hand-held scanners rely on the accuracy of a human user to guidethe scanner correctly across the document and are often limited by their sizeas to the area they can scan.andM;Resolution and grey scalesandM;The majority of scanners have a resolution of 300dpi, which matches thelikely output resolution of a laser printer.andP;  However, there are scannersavailable at other resolutions and it is not uncommon to find 200 dpi and1,200dpi scanners advertised.andP;  In addition, there are scanners with unusualresolutions that have been developed to work effectively with typesetters.andM;A resolution of 300dpi seems at face value to be the best option, becauseoutput to a laser printer will be at the same resolution, and for items suchas text and line art it is an acceptable level of resolution.andP;  Unfortunately,to include grey scales in a DTP document it is necessary to compromise,because the output devices cannot currently output greys.andP;  To produce greys,the dots are combined to form pixels and the number of dots used in a pixelwill determine the grey level that the eye perceives.andP;  This process, calleddithering, produces a grey effect on a bi-tone laser printer, but iteffectively reduces the resolution.andP;  Some scanners use dithering wheninputting a document, which is not as flexible as true grey scale scanningbut can be useful where your printer or software cannot handle grey scalefiles.andM;A full description of the problems associated with half-toning can be foundin 'Real World Postscript' by Stephen Roth (published by Addison-Wesley), butit is sufficient to say that if we require 16 grey scales (which is apractical value) on a 300dpi laser printer, you need only scan at about75dpi.andP;  Due to the way the eye works, the grey scales help to compensate forthe reduction in resolution, although loss of resolution is still noticeableat 300dpi.andP;  When higher resolution output devices are used, a greater numberof grey scales and a higher resolution scan can be used.andP;  The output devicethat is to be used and the type of scanning to be undertaken will affect boththe resolution and number of grey scales that are supported.andM;OCR and ICRandM;OCR is one of the processes for turning a scanned document into a text fileand is a more primitive form of ICR.andP;  The process by which OCR works is thata pixel by pixel match is carried out to determine the letters that are onthe page.andP;  This is done by overlaying a character mask on the scanneddocument and checking to see if it is an identical match.andP;  As each characteris matched, it is added to a file.andM;When a character mask is overlaid on the scanned document to determine thecharacter, the font and mask must be the same size.andP;  This means that theremust be different masks for each size of a typeface and that the systems aremost efficient when monospaced text is used.andP;  Within this restriction, ascanner resolution of 300dpi will provide a reasonably accurate result forthe limited range of fonts the system knows.andP;  The number of typefaces thatthe system has predefined is usually limited to less than a dozen, althoughmany systems have a learning facility to include new characters andtypefaces.andM;However, this can be a lengthy process and confusion can be caused due tocharacter additions such as umlauts, diaeresis and cedillas.andM;ICR is the second and more powerful method of turning a scanned document intoa text file.andP;  The process differs from the OCR method, in that the pixel mapof the font is replaced by an outline description of the typeface.andP;  Thismeans that the outline can be used for a vast range of fonts and a typicalICR system will recognize several thousand fonts.andP;  Since these systems do notuse a fixed pixel mask, they are more capable of handling typeset text asproblems associated with the mask overlaying two characters disappear.andM;The use of a character outline is only the first step in the ICR process, andeach ICR system will apply a range of additional processes to cross-check theoriginal character generation.andP;  Of the many methods the different ICRscanners provide, the two most common will suffice to highlight theadditional processing that takes place.andM;The first method is to carry out a frequency analysis on the converted textto establish that the frequency of characters produced matches that which isexpected for the language being converted.andP;  The second is a spelling check onthe text to catch any incorrectly converted characters.andM;However, to work effectively they require the system to be set up for thelanguage you are converting: there are obvious differences between French andEnglish that would cause problems, but enough differences exist betweenAmerican and UK English to adversely affect the conversion.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
