Grace andamp; Co. said its American Breeders Service unit and the University of Wisconsin successfully cloned two female calves as part of a joint research project.    Although the research team has cloned cows before, this time a new method was used that can produce far more cows than the previous method. Grace, a chemicals and energy concern, said the method has potential commercial applications including breeding &quot;genetically superior&quot; dairy cow herds.    John Sullivan, vice president of production for the De Forest, Wis., dairy and beef unit, said the process might be commercially viable within the next decade. But he added that some hurdles must be overcome. Not only is the process expensive, it is extremely labor intensive and the success rate of attempted clones is very low, he said.    The American Breeders' cloning process involves taking the nucleus of a cow embryo cell and inserting it into a newly fertilized egg that has had its genetic material removed. Mr. Sullivan said the method was applied to a large number of eggs but was successful in only two instances.    The project, led by University of Wisconsin Prof. Neal First, began five years ago. It initially cloned cows by splitting an embryo in half. &quot;That isn't very efficient. You can only get two, maybe three (clones), whereas this other procedure can produce hundreds,&quot; Mr. Sullivan said. </TEXT></DOC>
