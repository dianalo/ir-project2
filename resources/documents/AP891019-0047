REID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The strongest typhoon to strike thePhilippines this year lashed the east coast of Luzon Island todaywith 127 mph winds after residents of areas in its path were toldto seek higher ground.   Advance winds from Typhoon Elsie struck land at midday nearCasiguran, 130 miles north of Manila, and the center of the stormwas expected to come ashore a few hours later, according to theManila Weather Bureau.   Storm warnings were issued for all of Luzon, the mainPhilippines island, and at U.S. military installations.   ``Any typhoon of this strength is capable of massivedestruction,'' said forecaster Vicente Manalo.   Elsie's westward path would take it across the rugged mountainsof northeastern Luzon and across the north-central agriculturalheartland about 100 miles north of the capital.   There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage, butManila radio stations said they received sketchy reports offlooding and landslides in the north.   Manila radio station DZXL said its affiliate in Bayombong,capital of Nueva Vizcaya province 130 miles to the north, wasknocked off the air by a power failure.   U.S. officials said all six American military installations onLuzon had been placed on maximum typhoon alert.   U.S. Air Force forecasters predicted the storm would pass about50 miles north of Clark Air Base but near the U.S. John Hay AirStation in Baguio, 130 miles north of Manila.   The storm was reported moving about 12 mph and was expected toweaken as it crossed the Sierra Madre mountains of northeasternLuzon.   Philippine Airlines canceled flights from Manila to northernLuzon, and the coast guard ordered ships to stay in port in theaffected area.   U.S. Air Force officials said some jets had been moved to airbases in Japan and South Korea until the storm passed.   The Far East Network, which broadcasts to the 40,000-member U.S.military community, advised residents at Clark, John Hay and theU.S.-run Wallace Air Station to stock up on fresh water,flashlights, candles and other emergency equipment.   Residents at the U.S.-run Subic Bay naval base, 50 milesnorthwest of Manila, were also advised to take precautions.   Base spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Kevin Mukri said there were relativelyfew warships in port ``so we're not going to have a very big exodusif the conditions worsen.''   The Navy routinely sends warships into the South China Sea whenstorms threaten Subic.   Elsie was the third major storm to strike the Philippines in twoweeks.   Typhoon Dan hit Manila and southern Luzon on Oct. 10, killing atleast 59 people. On Oct. 6, Typhoon Angela killed at least 119people in northern Luzon.   An average of 20 typhoons and tropical storms strike thePhilippines annually. Elsie was the 17th of 1989.</TEXT></DOC>
