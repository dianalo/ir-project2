Eastern's last offer calledfor a top hourly wage of $16 for mechanics and $11.54 for rampservice workers. Mechanics would get an extra 50 cents an hour inSeptember 1993 under the proposed 4{-year contract. Easternmechanics now earn a top wage of $18.83 an hour and ramp serviceworkers $15.60 an hour.   The Machinists want $50 million in raises, an 8 percent hike, butlast week offered to delay increases for 15 months.</TEXT><HEAD>BENEFITS</HEAD><TEXT>   Eastern wants to impose a five-year freeze on all pension benefitincreases. Because its union pension funds are underfunded, a freezewould allow the airline to meet federal funding requirements.   The Machinists want increases in all benefits.</TEXT><HEAD>CONFLICT HISTORY</HEAD><TEXT>   The Machinists have fought wage cuts since contract renewal talksbegan in October 1987. Eastern pilots and flight attendants a yearearlier reached concessionary agreements that slashed pay by 20percent.   The National Mediation Board intervened in the dispute in January1988, but no progress was made during a year that included massivelayoffs and cost-cutting. The dispute reached loggerheads last monthafter Eastern rejected binding arbitration and the mediation boarddeclared a 30-day cooling-off period before a strike.   More than 97 percent of the Machinists on Feb. 15 authorized astrike. President Bush refused to intervene to delay the strike.Eastern's last contract offer would have cut pay but kept it 13percent higher than workers who took the 20 percent reductions. TheMachinists rejected it Friday, and the strike began at 12:01 a.m.Saturday.</TEXT><HEAD>FINANCIAL PROBLEMS</HEAD><TEXT>   The airline says it has lost more than $1 billion this decade andis losing more than $1 million a day. It also has $2.5 billion indebt. Texas Air Corp. bought Eastern in February 1986 and since thenhas undertaken a series of cutbacks in an attempt to restoreprofitability. The carrier's workforce since the takeover has shrunkto about 30,000 from 42,000. Eastern also has sold planes, cutprofitable routes, closed its Kansas City, Mo., hub and takensmaller savings measures such as eliminating hot food on someflights.   Eastern has about $400 million in cash to help it meet itsfinancial obligations during the strike. In addition, the pendingsale of Eastern's Northeast shuttle to developer Donald Trump willbring in about $365 million.</TEXT><HEAD>LAYING THE BLAME</HEAD><TEXT>   Management blames union militancy and unrealistic demands andsays it trimmed back operations elsewhere and needs labor to makesacrifices. Labor maintains Eastern is suffering because it didn'treact aggressively and competitively to airline deregulation in1978. In 1983, workers made wage concessions in return for futureprofits that never materialized and stock. They don't want furtherconcessions without proof Eastern is being managed with long-termcommitment to its financial fitness.</TEXT><HEAD>SECONDARY EFFECTS</HEAD><TEXT>   The 1926 National Railway Labor Act permits secondary boycotts,known as sympathy strikes, in air and rail travel. The Machinists onSunday decided not to set up pickets that threatened to disruptcommuting in major cities after a federal judge barred rail workersfrom honoring picket lines in the New York area. The Machinistsplanned to appeal. The nation's 12 commuter railroads and Amtrakwould be affected by any sympathy strikes.   The Air Line Pilots Association is asking pilots nationwide tostrictly follow aviation rules starting Tuesday in a job action thatcould delay every flight in the country.</TEXT></DOC>
