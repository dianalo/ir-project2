Mr. Libman's family-owned Libman Broom Co. is the largest of seven broom makers in the Arcola, Ill., area, which claims to be the biggest broom producer on the planet. &quot;Take a look at a new broom,&quot; Mr. Libman says. &quot;The straws are split into little feathery ends. That's what picks up the dust and dirt.&quot;    To underscore the superiority of new brooms over old, Arcola, a community of 2,700 located midway between Chicago and St. Louis, plans to hold the nation's first public broom burning tomorrow. The city will torch hundreds of old brooms in a downtown vacant lot as the highlight of its annual festival dedicated to broomcorn, the stuff that most brooms are made of.    Broom, Brush andamp; Mop, the industry trade journal that makes its headquarters in Arcola, says broom consumption seems to be holding steady, although plastic bristles swept away a piece of the broomcorn market about 25 years ago. The problem -- and hence tomorrow's broom bonfire -- is that people just won't throw away their old brooms.    &quot;People always say, 'I've got to buy a new broom,' but they don't,&quot; complains Alvin Wingler, whose Warren Broom Co. has been making brooms in Arcola since 1900. Brooms tend to last -- and last, Mr. Wingler says. And people won't throw them away, even when they should. &quot;You can't do much with an old broom,&quot; Mr. Wingler grumbles, &quot;except sweep rocks off the driveway.&quot;    Although brooms rank right down with horseshoes on the industrial evolutionary scale, they still provide some 250 jobs in Arcola. And the city is properly appreciative, celebrating the broomcorn -- which isn't corn at all but a form of sorghum -- for nearly a century. Besides the broom burning, this year's festival will have exhibitions of broom making, a miniature corn palace made out of broomcorn, and a big parade with floats, bands and horses.    And after the parade Arcola will break out its brooms to clean up, right? Not quite. &quot;With all those horses,&quot; says Mr. Libman, &quot;we use shovels.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
