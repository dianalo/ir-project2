A relatively stable dollar and signs that economic activity is slowing from the first quarter's brisk pace &quot;remove some of the pressure for higher inflation and rates,&quot; says James Capra, investment strategist at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc. &quot;You'll make more money&quot; buying bonds this month than selling them, he contends, following Friday's Labor Department report of a 0.2 percentage point gain in the May unemployment rate to 5.6% of the civilian work force.    &quot;Year in and year out, you get paid if you trade in line with the employment numbers, which showed the economy in May was a touch softer than in April,&quot; Mr. Capra adds.    The data helped lower the yield on the government's latest 30-year bond to just over 9% from 9.33% on May 27. &quot;It's a pretty good bet it could drop to 8.98% this week,&quot; predicts Roger Froehlich, president of Technical Dimensions Inc., a market forecasting service.    Even so, there is widespread concern that the recent bond rally won't last beyond the early summer. &quot;A long-term investor should wait before buying bonds,&quot; says Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Norwest Corp. Traders &quot;now are convinced the Federal Reserve doesn't need to tighten credit further, so the bond market may be stable and continue to register gains,&quot; he says. &quot;But the underlying trend for inflation is worrisome.&quot;    Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank, agrees. &quot;The unemployment report didn't suggest decisively we're heading into an inflationary boom or heading for an early recession,&quot; he says. Nevertheless, the latest data provided &quot;the highest reading of hourly earnings in four years and no evidence the economy is decelerating to a sluggish growth track. That means there's still a threat of rising inflation.&quot;    Some analysts say investors should be just as worried now as they were in May about a sudden lurch higher in interest rates. &quot;I don't think the drop in employment is compelling as an indication of slower growth because we're still close to full employment,&quot; says Lacy H. Hunt, chief economist at Carroll, McIntee andamp; McGinley Inc. and president of its CMandamp;M Asset Management Co. affiliate.    &quot;The action of the bond market the past week is inconsistent with inflation pressures, which definitely are building,&quot; adds Mr. Hunt, who has been mostly bearish on the bond market since the spring of 1987.    Traders attribute much of the bond market's rebound to the dollar's gains against major currencies recently. In addition, a smattering of bond purchase programs by some institutions last week prompted many government securities dealers into a stampede of short-covering, in which traders buy back borrowed securities they previously sold.    Until last week, many primary government securities dealers were consistently &quot;net short&quot; Treasury bonds and notes, according to recent data compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.    The Federal Reserve's move to nudge short-term interest rates higher the past two months &quot;provided support for the dollar because it was perceived as a high-yield currency,&quot; says Hung Q. Tran, director of fixed-income research at Deutsche Bank. &quot;It probably makes sense to hold dollar bonds at the moment, but faced with a choice two weeks from now of having to buy them or sell them, I'd be a seller,&quot; he says.    Mr. Hung asserts that a weaker dollar and higher U.S. interest rates are inevitable in the months ahead. He says the unusually wide gap between the general U.S. government deficit -- combining federal, state and local government deficits -- and the private saving-investment balance, or gross private savings minus gross private domestic investment, shows no signs of narrowing.    From 1955 to 1982, &quot;Every time the general deficit went up, the private saving-investment balance rose as well, eliminating a dependence on foreign capital,&quot; says Mr. Hung. Since 1982, however, the government deficit and saving-investment balance have diverged markedly, and net capital inflows from abroad surged to finance the gap, according to the 1987 Economic Report of the President, prepared by Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers.    &quot;Now the U.S. is dependent on these foreign capital flows to finance its deficit and that will continue to put upward pressure on interest rates and downward pressure on the dollar,&quot; Mr. Hung predicts.    ---   Friday's Market Activity   Prices of actively traded long-term government bonds rose nearly 1 1/8 points, or almost $11.25 for each $1,000 face amount.    While the Labor Department's employment report helped buoy the Treasury market, a strengthening dollar and the prospect of little if any 30-year bond issuance for the rest of the year accelerated the midweek short-covering rally among traders.    The price of the Treasury's 9 1/8% bonds due 2018 rose to 100 3/4 from 99 21/32 Thursday. The yield declined to 9.05% from 9.16%. The Treasury's 9% notes due 1998 rose to 100 9/32 from 99 17/32 as the yield fell to 8.96% from 9.07%.    An index of long-term Treasury bonds compiled by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. rose 12.09 points to 1238.49. The index ranged between 1225.99 and 1240.18.    Among short-term interest rates, the rate on three-month government bills rose to 6.45% bid from 6.44% bid Thursday. The rate on six-month bills fell to 6.70% bid from 6.80% bid. The rate on Federal funds, or reserves banks lend one another overnight, averaged 7.36%, according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.). Thursday's effective rate was 7.37%, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. </TEXT></DOC>
