<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-48-1086 </DOCNO><TEXT>A real-time imaging system using synchrotron radiation has been constructedfor phantom and animal studies on less invasive coronary angiography.The system consists of a monochromator, an x-ray image intensifier, atelevision camera, and data acquisition equipment. The quality of theimages obtained by the energy subtraction and temporal subtraction methodsis evaluated. A viewing field of 50 x 60 mm was used. The detection limitin the K-edge energy subtraction image was 0.5 mm for vessel phantomsfilled with 25-fold diluted agent (14 mg/ml iodine). The sensitivityand resolution of the system make it adaptable for use in transvenousangiography.</TEXT></DOC>
