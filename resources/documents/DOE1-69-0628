Adults return to spawn in late summer and fall. Young fish migratedownstream quickly and rear in estuaries. Chum salmon mature later inlife in more northerly water: in Alaska and British Columbia at age 4to 5, in Washington and Oregon at age 3 to age 4. Fish from larger riversystems grow to the largest size. The major commercial fishery is centeredin Southeast Alaska and British Columbia. Harvest has increased in Washingtonto 1,150,000 fish annually due to increased hatchery production, withHood Canal rivers accounting for 25% of all Washington fish. In odd-numberedyears, the adult return-to-escapement ratio in any given river systemis positively statistically correlated with increased spawning escapementof chum salmon relative to that of pink salmon.</TEXT></DOC>
