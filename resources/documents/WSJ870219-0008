Expectations of slack demand as the end of winter approaches as well as chart-guided technical trading added to the losses, traders said.    Continuing signs that some members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries aren't abiding by their output quotas prompted some initial selling, traders and analysts said. The oil ministers of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar said they will meet Sunday to discuss the apparent overproduction.    Some traders also cited unconfirmed reports that Iran may be selling some crude oil blends at as much as 50 cents a barrel below the prices set by OPEC.    &quot;It should be clear-cut that the OPEC deal is in big trouble and the whole thing is beginning to erode,&quot; John O'Dea, manager of international energy futures at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., New York, said.    Richard Redoglia, an oil broker for Merrill Lynch Futures Inc., New York, said, &quot;When there's too much oil available, it doesn't matter what OPEC says; the market will trade accordingly.&quot;    Crude oil contracts for March delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell as low as $17.26 a barrel, then closed at $17.40, down 39 cents for the day. It was the fifth consecutive decline in U.S. oil prices and the lowest close since Dec. 24, when crude oil contracts ended at $17.27 a barrel. Gasoline and heating oil futures prices plunged as well.    On the spot market, the price of West Texas Intermediate, the most widely traded U.S. crude, fell 40 cents a barrel to $17.40. The non-contract price of March North Sea Brent, the heavily traded European blend, also skidded 40 cents, to $16.95 a barrel.    Brokers said additional selling was triggered by reports that Iraq said it will stop shelling Iranian cities, except for what it considers military targets, for two weeks if Iran halts similar attacks on Iraq. An escalation of the war between the two nations and signs of significant advances by Iran helped prop up oil prices last month.    After the market closed Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, said U.S. gasoline stockpiles as of last Friday were 255.3 million barrels, or more than 5% above year-earlier levels.    &quot;There's still a tremendous product overhang,&quot; Mark Scullion, energy specialist at Mocatta Futures Corp., New York, said.    Some traders took profits yesterday afternoon by buying contracts to offset those sold earlier. The purchases lifted prices above their lows for the day. Still, further short-term declines are likely, many said, suggesting that traders will continue to sell contracts to offset those bought when oil prices were rising in December and January.    &quot;The more this (decline) continues, the more difficult it will be to find buyers,&quot; one trader in New York said.    Dean Witter's Mr. O'Dea said it's likely that prices will soon fall to $16 a barrel, adding, &quot;I wouldn't rule out $14.&quot;    However, other analysts predicted that prices will rebound once they fall to about $17 a barrel.    &quot;That level may lend a little bit of support,&quot; Mocatta's Mr. Scullion said. </TEXT></DOC>
