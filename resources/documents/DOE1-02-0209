Threemiles west of the plant is the village of Mammoth Lakes, a well-knownwinter and summer resort. Field construction of the power plants wasminimized by the use of modular design. Two identical units were built,side by side, with common utilities and common spare equipment. Thispaper describes the reservoir, design criteria, the Rankin cycle system,and construction of the plants. The operating history of the wells, theplant, the isobutane pumps, the brine-isobutane heat exchangers, aircoolers, and the turbine-generators is discussed. Economics are brieflymentioned.</TEXT></DOC>
