On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the November contract forWest Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, settled9 cents higher at $14.65 a barrel Thursday. Other contract monthsalso were higher at the close.   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for October delivery gained 0.50cent to close at 45.85 cents a gallon, while other contract monthsclosed mixed.   The October wholesale heating oil contract lost 0.03 cent tosettle at 41.06 cents a gallon. Other heating oil contracts settledmostly higher.   Analysts said the market continued firming in anticipation ofthe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' price monitoringcommittee meeting scheduled for Sunday and Monday.   ``Although there's no overreaction, there's a firm undertone onthe possibility that there might be some news from OPEC,'' saidChris McCormack a trader with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.   U.S. market prices were aided early in the day by reports of afire on an oil drilling platform in the North Sea, but slacked offon news that the blaze was under control, analysts said.   But the market's overall strength continued to be OPEC-related,analysts said.   ``The market is showing very rational behavior to not react torumors in advance of the OPEC meeting,'' said Bob Baker, an analystwith Prudential BAche Securities Inc. ``The market is properly notexpecting anything significant to come out of the price committeemeeting. But it's a hopeful sign overall.''   The five-member pricing committee has no authority to decidepolicy but can call a meeting of all 13 members of the cartel. Oilprices hit two-year lows recently because of the world oversupplyof oil and reports that many OPEC members were exceeding productionquotas.   The price committee meeting suggests the possibility that OPECmembers might get together and set production limits that wouldraise world oil prices.   The five committee members are Venezuela, Algeria, Saudi Arabia,Indonesia and Nigeria.</TEXT></DOC>
