Concurrency control and recovery havebecome increasingly important as businesses rely more and more heavilyon their on-line data processing activities. For high performance, thesystem must maximize concurrency by multiprogramming transactions. Butthis can lead to interference between queries and updates, which concurrencycontrol mechanisms must avoid. In addition, a satisfactory recovery systemis necessary to ensure that inevitable transaction and database systemfailures do not corrupt the database.</TEXT></DOC>
