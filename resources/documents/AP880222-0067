Also today, hospital officials said a 14-year-old Arab boy waswounded in the thigh in the Gaza Strip.   The army reported an Arab was arrested after trying to attack anIsraeli soldier with a knife in the West Bank town of Ramallah. Itwas the third such attack on soldiers in four days.   Leaflets distributed by underground Palestinian groups in theoccupied territories called for demonstrations this week _beginning with memorial services on ``Martyrs Day'' today _ toprotest the visit to Israel by Secretary of State George P. Shultz.   Army officials said the five-day visit, scheduled to startThursday, might prompt an escalation in violence in the West Bankand Gaza Strip. ``It's not organized or systematic, but outsideevents like the Shultz visit do affect the situation,'' an armyspokeswoman said. She spoke on condition of anonymity.   Attorney General Yosef Harish sent a letter to Defense MinisterYitzhak Rabin saying soldiers may not use force as a means ofpunishment or humiliation, Israel radio reported.   Orders that call for such use of force are illegal, ruledHarish, who demanded Rabin issue appropriate instructions to thetroops. Harish said many Palestinians have complained to him aboutabuse by soldiers.   In an army survey, 65 percent of soldiers questioned said theyhad witnessed rough treatment of Palestinians by troops, said thearmy's chief psychologist, Col. Shlomo Dover. The radio did not sayhow many soldiers were questioned.   Dover said 70 percent felt angry and frustrated by the situationin the occupied lands and said they thought using the army to breakup civilian protests damages its effectiveness to fight a war.   Dover told Israel radio that 92 percent of the soldiersquestioned expressed full trust in their commanders.   ``We don't have problems with the motivation of soliders ... notthat they rejoice to do it, but it's an assignment that has beengiven to the army and that's how it is seen by the soldiers,'' hesaid.   Since the wave of protests began Dec. 8 in the territoriesIsrael seized in the 1967 Middle East War, Israelis have killed 61Palestinians. The latest fatalities were two men shot and killed bysoldiers Sunday.   The government has spent $330 million, or 1 percent of thegovernment's 1988 budget, in an attempt to quell the violence.   In one memorial services today, women marched to a cemetery inthe West Bank village of Anabta to honor three residents who diedin clashes with the army earlier this month.   A Molotov cocktail was thrown at an Israeli car in the West Banktown of Ramallah, but no one was injured, the army said.   In the Gaza Strip refugee camp of Jabaliya, soldiers clashedwith protesters, and a 14-year-old boy was shot in the thigh,doctors at Gaza City's Shifa Hospital said.   In Gaza City, anti-American slogans painted in red on closedstore shutters read: ``No to the Shultz visit. Yes to thePalestinian government. Yes to the PLO.''   The Palestine Liberation Organization has ordered Palestiniansin the West Bank and Gaza Strip not to meet with Shultz, saying heis pro-Israeli and has rejected minimal Palestinian demands.   But local Palestinian leaders said today that they were tryingto persuade PLO chief Yasser Arafat to lift the ban. U.S. officialsmet with several Palestinian representatives over the weekend todiscuss the Shultz visit.   During his visit, Shultz will present to Israeli leaders a U.S.peace initiative calling for an international forum for directtalks on Palestinian self-rule and negotiations on a finalsettlement by December.   But Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told European Jewish leadersSunday night he objected to the hurried pace: ``Any attempt toforce the pace and shorten the period (of self-rule) would be adetriment to the very essence of the agreement.''   He also indicated he would not give in to pressure to accept theAmerican plan: ``When the time comes for decisions, we shall decideon the basis of what is in our national interests.''</TEXT></DOC>
