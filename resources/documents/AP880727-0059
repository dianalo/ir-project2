Discovery of the 20 bodies in the ship's lounge and cabinsraised to 29 the confirmed death toll from Saturday's collision,the officials said. Forty-eight people, most members of a companyfishing club, had been on the chartered boat.   Workers used a 230-foot crane to raise the hull to the surfacein pre-dawn darkness today near the mouth of Tokyo Bay. A hole wasvisible in its bow just below the waterline.   Coast guard ships brought victims' relatives to within a fewyards of where the boat, the No. 1 Fujimaru, was raised from adepth of about 160 feet.   Survivors, relatives of victims and newspapers charged that crewmembers aboard the submarine stood by watching on the submarine'sdeck while victims drowned. The submarine sustained little damageand no injuries were reported among the 75 men on board.   One survivor from the fishing boat told reporters the sub'screwmen stared back as she waved and yelled, ``Why won't you help?''   Of the 19 people rescued from the 154-ton fishing boat, whichsank in less than two minutes, 16 were picked up by other passingvessels and only three by the submarine. One man died later in ahospital.   News reports said Defense Agency chief Tsutomu Kawara offeredhis resignation over the accident but will stay on until aninvestigation is complete. Defense officials said they could notcomment on the reports.   The status of Japan's military, officially called theSelf-Defense Forces, is still a sensitive issue after the militaryexcesses of World War II.   The nation's constitution officially bars the maintenance of all``war potential,'' and sharp public criticism usually follows anyaccident for which the Self-Defense Forces is responsible.   News reports suggested the captain of the submarine, the2,200-ton Nadashio, may have erred just before the collision.   The accident occurred as the submarine, traveling on thesurface, was cutting across a busy shipping lane to enter Yokosukanaval base, shared by the Japanese and U.S. navies.   Japanese maritime rules say the vessel approaching from the leftmust take evasive action when on a collision course with anothership, while the second ship must maintain its direction. But KyodoNews Service and NHK television reports quoted the fishing boat'ssurviving crew as saying the Nadashio, on the left, honked at thefishing boat to warn it out of its path.   Just before the crash, both ships turned in the same direction,and collided almost head-on.   ``As captain of the ship, I did my best until the last minute toavoid a collision according to maritime collision preventionlaws,'' Manji Kondo, the 30-year-old captain of the fishing boat,told a televised news conference late Tuesday.   Admiral Shuichiro Higashiyama, navy chief of staff, toldreporters today he believes the submarine's crew took propermeasures to avoid the accident.   But he said ``appropriate actions would be taken'' against anyofficials found responsible for the accident in the final judgmentby the Marine Accidents Inquiry Agency.   It was the worst collision between Japanese navy and civilianvessels since World War II, defense officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
