In many cases today, the air-to-air heatpump is able to compete economically with electrical resistance heatingsystems. From a prime energy use point of view, it can raise the overallefficiency of electrical heating from 28 to 42%. If the seasonal performancefactor could be improved, in this case by 55%, such a pump would be moreresource energy efficient than conventional oil and gas furnaces. A numberof alternative heat pump systems - ground-source, solar-assisted, and&quot;ice-maker&quot; heat pumps - require further investigation to assess theirpotential for residential application. There is little doubt as to theperformance improvements possible through the use of alternative heatsources for the heat pump, but three important factors need to be considered:initial cost to the consumer, system reliability, and the load factorand time of peak demand on the electrical utility. 8 refs., 13 figs.,3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
