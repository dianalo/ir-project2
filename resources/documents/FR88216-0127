The purposes of this amendmentare to allow the use of ``exception rents'' in determining the maximuminitial rent for a unit in Shared Housing (under andSection; 882.320(b)),to require each sharing family initially to lease space of appropriatesize (under andSection; 882.315(b)(1)), and to remove a dollar limit on thegross rent payable for each family (under andSection; 882.320(d)), whichbecomes unnecessary with the addition of the unit size requirement. Thechanges to andSection; 882.320 will make the Shared Housing component ofthe Section 8 Certificate program like the rest of the program where thereis no reason to make a distinction. The change to andSection; 882.315 willrequire an appropriate portion of a unit to be leased, so that the limitstated in andSection; 882.320(b) on the Fair Market Rent acts as an appropriatedollar limit.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>March 28, 1988 for the June 11, 1986 rule, asamended by this rule. (Under section 7(o)(3) of the Department of Housingand Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3535(o)(3)), this final rule cannotbecome effective until after the first period of 30 calendar days of continuoussession of Congress that occurs after the date of the rule's publication.The final rule that this rule amends has not yet been made effective, although30 days of continuous session of Congress have expired since its publicationin June 1986. The Department is now ready to implement the program. Therefore,the June 1986 rule as amended by this rule will become effective on March15, 1988, a date by which the rquired waiting period for this rule willhave expired.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Susan Loritz, Existing HousingDivision, Office of Multifamily Housing Programs, Department of Housingand Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20410-8000,telephone (202) 755-6887. (This is not a toll-free number.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Section 882.320(b), a section addedfor Shared Housing to correspond to andSection; 882.106 for the regular Certificateprogram, would provide that the initial gross rent for a family may notexceed the pro rata portion of the ``published'' Fair Market Rent (FMR)for the entire unit. This rule amends that section to provide that theinitial gross rent may not exceed the pro rata portion of the publishedFair Market Rent or other rent approved in accordance with andSection; 882.106(a)for the entire unit (``exception rent''). An ``exception rent'' is an initialgross rent (rent to owner plus allowance for tenant-paid utilities) higherthan the published FMR that is approved for an area or a unit in accordancewith andSection; 882.106(a).Section 882.320(d) as published on June 11, 1986, would limit the grossrent paid on behalf of a sharing family by stating that it may not exceedthe FMR (or exception rent) for the bedroom size stated on the family'sCertificate. If the FMRs applicable to each family based on the numberof bedrooms stated on its Certificate were added together, the result couldbe quite out of proportion to the value received. Since the FMRs are developedto correspond to the value of an individual unit containing a specifiednumber of bedrooms plus a separate kitchen, bathroom and living areas ratherthan a specified number of bedrooms and a shared kitchen, bathroom, andliving areas, the Department has determined that this gross rent restrictionis inappropriate to Shared Housing, where the rent paid buys each familyonly limited private space, with the remainder of the space used in commonwith another family. Therefore, this rule removes paragraph (d) from andSection;882.320 before its implementation.To assure that the amount paid on behalf of an assisted family is not outof proportion to the needs of the family or the value of the space occupiedby the family, paragraph (b) of andSection; 882.315 (which corresponds toandSection; 882.209(i) for the regular Certificate program) is being amendedto require that the private space of a sharing family initially containthe number of bedrooms stated on the family's Certificate (except for twoindividuals sharing a one-bedroom unit). Combined with the limit statedin andSection; 882.320(b) on the amount payable for the unit, this restrictionwill assure that the amount paid on behalf of assisted families sharinga unit will not be excessive_either with respect to the unit as a whole,or with respect to a particular family. However, nothing in the regulatoryrequirement that at initial occupancy the tenant may not lease more bedroomspace than it is entitled to under its Certificate precludes an owner frompermitting the tenant to use additional space, provided that use of additionalspace is and continues to be discretionary and the owner may deny use ofsuch space at any time.This change to andSection; 882.315 will apply to a sharing family both atinitial occupancy (the topic of andSection; 882.320) and to replacement ofa departed family (see andSection; 882.335(c)). Thus, the requirement ofandSection; 882.335(c)(2)(iii) that a successor family have the same ContractRent as the family it is replacing will be particularly fitting, becauseboth the departed family and the successor family_at the time of initialoccupancy of the unit_will have needed the same number of bedrooms.<ITAG tagnum="84">Findings and Certifications</ITAG><T3>Final Rule. </T3>It is the policy of this Department to publish forcomment, rules relating to public property, loans, grants, benefits, orcontracts, despite the exemption for these rules contained in 5 U.S.C.553 from the requirement to solicit public comment. However, under 24 CFRPart 10, in a particular case, the Department may omit solicitation ofpublic comment before publishing a final rule if such comment is not requiredby statute and HUD determines that solicitation and consideration of publiccomment are ``impracticable, unnecessary or contrary to the public interest.''In this case, no statute requires the solicitation and consideration ofpublic comment. The amendment does not impose a burden on the intendedbeneficiaries of the program, or on the public housing agencies that administerthe program. Rather, the amendment will permit a PHA to approve a higherrent for Shared Housing (in situations where exception rents are appropriate),and thus may increase the availability of Shared Housing for assisted families.Adding the authority for a PHA to use exception rents in the Shared Housingcomponent of the Certificate program makes this part of the program consistentwith the rest of the program (see andSection; 882.106). At this time, theDepartment finds no reason for denying the option of exception rent limitsfor families that elect to rent units in Shared Housing. We note that themaximum initial rent for one sharing family under andSection; 882.320(b),based on its pro rata share of the FMR for a larger shared unit, combinedwith the amendment requiring assisted families to lease space containingthe same number of bedrooms for the family as is stated on its Certificate,will produce a reasonable rent limit for sharing families. The removalof paragraph (d) from andSection; 882.320_a paragraph added solely for SharedHousing_relieves PHAs from making an additional calculation that wouldhave no impact after the addition of the matching of bedroom size. TheDepartment has determined that it is unnecessary and contrary to the publicinterest to solicit public comment before making these changes to the SharedHousing component of the Certificate program before its implementation.<T3>Environment. </T3>An environmental assessment is not required underthe National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4332, since theSection 8 Existing Housing program is categorically excluded from the environmentalreview requirement under HUD regulations implementing that Act (24 CFR50.20(d)).<T3>Regulatory Impact Analysis. </T3>This rule does not constitute a ``majorrule'' as that term is defined in section 1(b) of the Executive Order onFederal Regulation issued by the President on February 17, 1981.
