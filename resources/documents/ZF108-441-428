(MITI).andM;RP[T.sup.2]C version 3.0 converts Oracle's SQL*Report code into ANSI C code,enabling users to run their reports many times faster, company officialssaid.andP;  Converting the SQL*Report code to C code also opens the application toportability and easier modification by programmers.andM;&quot;We convert the RPT, Oracle's interpretive code, into executable C,eliminating the need to run an intermediate file, which reduces the I/O by 70percent,&quot; said Paul Belmonte, MITI's director of marketing and sales.andM;&quot;We also offer built-in array charts, array fetch and debugging, and enableusers to incorporate non-database files into reports,&quot; Belmonte said.andP;  &quot;Withrelease 3, we eliminate the need to run RPF, Oracle's report format, which istime-consuming and I/O-intensive.andP;  You go from the report to screen or paperas soon as the execution command is given.&quot;andM;With this new version of RP[T.sup.2]C, reports can be viewed or printed asthey are created.andP;  Users can add free text to reports using the LONG datatype, check SQL syntax without having to run the report and execute reportsfrom Oracle's SQL*Forms.andM;Users don't have to learn anything new to take advantage of RP[T.sup.2]C'scapabilities, Belmonte said, because the tool is invisible to the user.andM;&quot;There is no learning curve, and it takes around 20 minutes to install,&quot; hesaid.andP;  &quot;It pushes the software to give full use of Oracle's capabilities andtakes the load off the hardware .andP;  .  .  Oracle is very CPU-intensive.andM;&quot;It may take half an hour less to [do] a report, and the CPU then can be usedelsewhere,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;We have saved clients expensive hardware upgrades,because we've helped them to make better use of their [existing] hardwarecapabilities.&quot;andM;SQL*Text is a text-retrieval tool that allows users to enter and edit textwithin Oracle's SQL*Forms and then retrieve documents or records via keywords that can be combined with operators such as AND, OR and NOT, officialssaid.andP;  Users can view how text relates to formatted data fields, because freetext queries can be combined with formatted SQL*Forms queries, they added.andM;Text can be indexed using an &quot;open&quot; mode, which lets users index every wordexcept words on an exclusion list, or a &quot;closed&quot; mode, which indexes onlywords for which the user has specified an interest.andM;SQL*Text has a window editor for text entry and includes features such asword wrap, rejustification and a zoom capability that enlarges a field tofull screen size.andP;  The window is linked to a regular character field, whichis limited to 250 characters, and the LONG data type, limited to 64,000characters, officials added.andM;Version 2.0 of SQL*Text includes a new manager tool to control indexing andretrieval, performance improvements designed to speed the processing ofcomplex queries, and a reduction of the space required to store the index,according to Ofir Kedar, MITI's technical manager.andM;Version 3.0 of RP[T.sup.2]C is available now for Sun, Unix and VMS systems.andO;Version 2.0 of SQL*Text is available now for VMS and Unix, and will beavailable for Sun workstations this month.andM;Prices range from $8,500 to $32,000 for RP[T.sup.2]C, and from $8,000 to$54,000 for SQL*Text.andM;Management Information Technology Inc. is located at 3703 Long Beach Blvd.,andO;Suite E-14, Long Beach CA 90807, (213) 424-4399.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
