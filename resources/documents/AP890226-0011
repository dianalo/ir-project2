Younis is the first suspect arrested overseas and tried under the1984 Hostage-Taking Act, which gives the government ``long arm''jurisdiction in cases involving American hostages.   Younis, 29, is a relative small fry, said Neil Livingstone, anexpert on terrorism. ``This is not the John Dillinger of theterrorist world. He is a relatively low-level terrorist,''Livingstone said.   But to nab him federal authorities cast a multi-million dollarnet involving undercover agents, an aircraft carrier, helicoptersand a fleet of aircraft, according to court arguments and documentsin the case.   Four days after his arrest on Sept. 13, 1987, Younis was flown tothe United States in a 13-hour flight aboard a plane that refueledseveral times in the air, avoiding any contact with foreigngovernments that might have clouded U.S. jurisdiction in the case.   U.S. agents used sensitive intelligence methods in making thearrest, and a number of the key players in the case are living undernew identities in the federal witness protection program,prosecutors said during a pretrial hearing on Wednesday.   At the hearing, U.S. Distrist Chief Judge Aubrey Robinson Jr.denied requests by defense attorney Francis D. Carter for access toclassified information in 12 categories, ranging from the names ofhigh-level policymakers who helped plan the arrest to details aboutU.S. Air Force, Army, Navy and intelligence assets used in the case.   Younis is accused of leading a band of men who, armed with AK-47assault rifles, shot their way past security guards and boarded aRoyal Jordanian jetliner in Beirut on June 11, 1985.   Younis was a member of Lebanon's Amal militia, a Shiite Moslemfaction. He was under orders to fly the plane to Tunis, where anArab League meeting was under way, and read a statement demandingthe withdrawal of Palestinian guerrillas from Lebanon, defensecounsel Carter said Wednesday.   Tunisian authorities denied the plane permission to land and itreturned to Beirut.   The evidence against Younis includes a videotape of him on theBeirut tarmac, armed with an assault rifle, announcing that theBoeing 727 would be blown up.   One of the passengers, William L. Slade, has also testified thatYounis emerged from the plane's cockpit several times during the39-hour hijacking and ordered other hijackers to stop beatingJordanian skymarshals. The beatings resumed when Younis returned tothe cockpit, Slade testified, identifying the defendant in thecourtroom. No one was killed in the hijacking.   In Septmeber 1987, Younis was lured to the Mediterranean islandof Cyprus by a friend, identified by federal authorities as JamalHamdan.   Court papers contain the transcript of a conversationclandestinely recorded at Hamdan's apartment on Cyprus, in whichYounis said he was picked for the hijacking by the head of Amal,Nabih Berri, who is also Lebanon's justice minister.   Berri has denounced the arrest as ``an attack against the honorof Lebanon.''   During pretrial argument, the defense attorney said he would notcontend that Berri ordered the hijacking, but that his client wouldtestify that he was under orders to pirate a plane to Tunis.   According to the defense attorney's arguments in court, JamalHamdan and his brother Ali lured Younis from Cyprus to a two-mastedsailboat with the promise of a drug deal and a party.   Two FBI agents, a man and a woman, were aboard the yacht, whichwas located in international waters to avoid the need forextradition hearings.   In the struggle to arrest Younis, both his wrists sufferedhairline fractures, federal authorities said when they announced thearrest.   Younis was transferred to a naval supply vessel, the USS Butte,which took four days to carry him to the western Mediterrean, wherehe was moved to the carrier USS Saratoga, Carter said at the hearing.   Carter asked to introduce evidence that five doctors were flownby helicopter to the Saratoga beforehand in the event that Youniswas hurt, but that the defendant was not treated until after heconfessed.   ``The only medication my client received was a bag of ice,'' thedefense attorney said.   The court, said the judge, ``will allow the defense to argue thatfour days is a long time to transport the defendant from the easternMediterranean to the western Mediterranean'' and that ``that therewas not a normal complement aboard the ship,'' said Robinson.   The defense, in debating whether the ``confession was free andvoluntary,'' will be allowed to argue that there was ``undue delay''in diagnosing and treating Younis, the judge said.</TEXT></DOC>
