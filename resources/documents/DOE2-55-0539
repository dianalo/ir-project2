<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-55-0539 </DOCNO><TEXT>The quantity of released exoelectrons per incident particle (exoelectronefficiency) is 0.002 to 0.004 for Co-60 gamma rays, 0.5 (Tl-204, Sr-90,Y-90) to 2.3 (Ni-63) for beta rays, and 0.66 (4 MeV) for alpha rays.The efficiency increases with decreasing range of incident particlesand with increasing stopping power. In the case of gamma rays, the exoelectronefficiency per excited electron is about 0.028 assuming that the energyabsorbed in the BeO surface layer (1000 A) serves to excite the electronswithin the layer (exciting energy 10 eV). A sample may be exposed toa significant amount of natural radiations before irradiation. When applyingTSEE to dosimetry, therefore, the device should be able to measure adose of about 10 {mu} R with a high accuracy and high S/N ratio. Thesensitivity is the highest for a gas flow type exoelectron detector consistingof a methane-based mono-point counter and a charge-sensitive preamplifier.Thermolex 995 BeO has the highest sensitivity. By using 7 mg/cm/sup 2/-thickaluminum foil attached to the BeO surface, the skin surface absorbeddose required by ICRP can be determined from measured TSEE without knowingthe incident beta ray energy.
