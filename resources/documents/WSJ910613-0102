Yesterday, Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. told employees ina firmwide conference call that it will stop giving &quot;up-frontrecruiting bonuses&quot; to brokers who defect from other firms tojoin Shearson. The brokerage-firm unit of American ExpressCo. had been aggressively paying bonuses of $100,000 and upsince last summer to rebuild its brokerage force. ButShearson said yesterday it hopes to phase out the payments byyear end.</LP><TEXT>   Other big securities firms say they are pulling back, too.At Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., once-commonplace brokerbonuses are now &quot;the exception to the rule,&quot; an executivesays. In recent months, the Primerica Corp. unit says it hasscreened outside brokers much more rigidly. PaineWebber GroupInc. and Prudential Securities Inc., a unit of PrudentialInsurance Co. of America, are both toning down their bonusprograms, but not eliminating them.   &quot;We never liked {recruiting bonuses}. We still don't likeit,&quot; said Joseph J. Plumeri, president of Shearson'sprivate-client group, in an interview. But &quot;even though wefound the process abhorrent we had to do it to defendourselves. We all have to do things we'd rather not do.&quot;   Wall Street is finding that paying upfront bonuses --six-figure packages for top-producing brokers who bring in$300,000 to $1 million annually in commissions -- can berisky. Some brokers didn't live up to their star billing, andgenerated far less business at their new firms. Staff moraleoften was hurt because the new brokers were being paid farmore than those already at the firm for producing the sameamount of business.   &quot;The more intelligent managers are determining that unlessthere's a real economic value&quot; in giving up-front bonuses,&quot;they don't do it,&quot; says Frank G. Zarb, Smith Barney'schairman and chief executive officer.   Bonuses probably won't be purged entirely, because fewbrokerage firms are willing to risk being run over by thecompetition. Says a senior PaineWebber executive: &quot;We're notgoing to be a beached whale and get pecked to death&quot; byraiders.   Wall Street firms have always poached each other's starbrokers and through them, their customers -- attention towhom sometimes dwindles amid the free-agent mania. But amidlast year's profit slump, the raiding exploded intofull-scale war. It was a replay of what happened on WallStreet in 1984, when the stock market slumped, and againafter the 1987 stock-market crash.   But &quot;firms are finding that it's costing too much,&quot; saysMichael King, who runs a stockbroker recruiting firm.Although hiring bonuses are still being doled out, Mr. Kingsays, &quot;there are signs of a pullback.&quot;   For example, PaineWebber has cut back its front-endpayouts, ratcheting down the typical bonus to 25% from 35% ofa broker's annual production revenue -- with an additional 5%left to the discretion of a divisional manager. For a brokerwho generates, say, $400,000 in annual commissions, that's a29% plunge to a $100,000 bonus.   Prudential Securities, though still a big bonus player,says it is studying a bonus system based on how long brokersstay at the firm, rather than forking over an upfront payout.The plan was hatched since Hardwick Simmons -- a formerShearson executive who has long been a vocal opponent of bigpayouts -- took over as Prudential Securities' new chiefexecutive in April.   &quot;It's foolish over a period of time to pay another firm'sproducer more than one you have for the same amount of work,&quot;says a Prudential Securities executive. A typical bonus atPrudential is about 30% of the prior year's production, and acut of 45% or more of the commissions brought in during thefirst year.   Some brokerage firms say they've never gotten involved inbroker-war payouts and say they're not about to start now.&quot;We're always looking to hire good people, but we're notpaying up-front money or using forgivable loans,&quot; says Alan&quot;Ace&quot; Greenberg, chairman and chief executive of Bear StearnsCos.   Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., the nation's biggest brokerage firm,also has largely avoided playing the bonus-baby game; itdoesn't have to, because it trains so many of its own brokersand holds onto them.   As for Shearson's strategy reversal, the firm said it wasforced into the broker wars because it was hit so hard bydefections amid its financial and management turmoil of ayear ago. The brokerage firm, the nation's second-largest,has watched its sales force shrink to 8,600 this year fromits high of 12,000 in 1988 after its takeover of E.F. Huttonandamp; Co. Only part of the decline was planned, as part of acostcutting closing and consolidation of 20% of the firm'sbranches.   Mr. Plumeri said Shearson hopes to build its broker forceback up to 9,000 or 9,200.   &quot;Last year we got hit by the competition a lot. And justfrom a defensive point of view we entered the {recruiting}fray,&quot; Mr. Plumeri said. But Shearson said it no longer feelsa need to pay big bonuses, partly because of an improvementin its fortunes; the firm earned $51 million in the firstquarter, reversing two consecutive years of first-quarterlosses.   Some of Shearson's competitors scoff at the firm's newhigh-mindedness. Indeed, Shearson conceded that it will stillmake &quot;accelerated payouts&quot; to new brokers. That is, certaintop-producing brokers may get 50% to 60% of their commissionsduring their first year at Shearson, rather than the standard40% or so. But Mr. Plumeri said such accelerated payoutsaren't as unseemly as bonuses because they are linked toperformance.   In his conference call with brokers yesterday, Mr. Plumerialso said Shearson would refocus on training new brokers, anactivity it had cut back to save money. Shearson, which oncetrained 800 to 1,000 brokers annually, trained only 500 lastyear and will likely train about 300 this year (up from the100 originally planned). For 1992, Mr. Plumeri suggestedShearson may resume training as many as it used to.   Over the next few years, Shearson's brokerage divisionwill be committed to &quot;people that you grow in-house,&quot; Mr.Plumeri said.</TEXT></DOC>
