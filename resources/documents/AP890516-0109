Police said 46 other people were wounded in the explosion, whichoccurred as the Arab League tried to maintain a 6-day-old truce tohalt the latest fighting between Moslem and Christian forces.   Among the dead was Grand Mufti Hassan Khaled, the Sunni Moslemreligious leader and a prominent voice of moderation who had beeninvolved in efforts to end the bloodshed.   The explosion happened at 1 p.m. as Khaled was being driventhrough the crowded Aishe Bakkar district from his office to hishome for lunch, a police spokesman said.   The spokesman, who cannot be named under standing rules, saidKhaled's driver and three other people riding in his car werekilled. Four Lebanese riot policemen riding in a jeep in front ofKhaled's car also were among the fatalities.   The bomb-laden car blew up only 100 yards from the home ofacting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni politician who heads theMoslem Cabinet in Lebanon's dual government. It was not clear whereHoss was at the time, but one of his bodyguards guarding thebuilding in which he lives was killed by flying glass and shrapnel.   Khaled, 68, is survived by a wife and four sons.   Pools of blood filled the street and Khaled's black Cadillac wassmashed. Police reinforments sealed off the area as ambulancesarrived to evacuate victims.   The explosion tore off the facade of a four-story apartmentbuilding in front of which the explosives-packed car was parked.Several other buildings, including a mosque, were wrecked within a50-yard radius.   Fire engines rushed to Aishe Bakkar and began dousing dozens ofsmoldering cars with water hoses.   The spokesman said he could not tell whether the bomb-laden carwas detonated by remote control or a timing device. All Beirutradio stations, however, said the blast was a ``premeditatedassassination.''   Moslem and Christian radio stations interrupted programming tobroadcast news of the explosion.   When Khaled's death was confirmed, they joined in mourning,displaying a rare show of unity. Moslem radios broadcast versesfrom the Koran, Islam's holy book, and the Christian stationsplayed somber music.   It was the sixth car bombing in Lebanon this year. By policecount, 28 people were killed and 218 wounded in the previous blasts.   Eleven political leaders of the Sunni sect, including threeformer prime ministers, held an emergency meeting at Khaled'sheadquarters an hour after the explosion. Khaled's four sons alsoattended.   Khaled, the widely respected spiritual guide of Lebanon's900,000 Sunnis, had publicly advocated Christian-Moslemco-existence in the tiny Mediterranean nation where the twocommunities have been locked in 14 years of civil warfare.   Lebanon's Sunni Moslem community is smaller and considered moremoderate than the Shiite Moslem majority. Shiite Moslems loyal toIran are believed to be holding the 15 Western hostages, includingnine Americans. The Sunnis are believed not to be involved inhostage-taking.   Theologically, Shiite and Sunni Moslems differ on the successorto the prophet Mohammed, and while Sunnis accept the Sunna as theauthoritative supplement to the Koran, Shiites do not.   During the latest round of bloodshed which erupted March 8,Khaled made several calls for restraint, stressing that allproblems could be solved through dialogue. He also had declaredsupported for Arab League efforts to enforce a cease-fire.   Shortly before the explosion, police said that about 60 shellsand rockets, fired from Syrian and Druse Moslem positions, hadcrashed on a two-mile coastal strip in the Christian heratlandnorth of Beirut.   Despite the hostilities, a Museum crossing between the twosectors of the divided capital was reopened to motorists,pedestrians and trucked food and fuel supplies after a nine-weekshutdown forced by the fighting.   Police said today's shelling was aimed at preventing shipssuspected of carrying arms from docking at the Christian ports ofByblos and Amsheet, about 20 miles north of the capital.   The Syrians and their Druse Moslem allies have charged that armycommander Gen. Michel Aoun's 20,000-member Christian army has beengetting arms and ammunition from Iraq through Byblos and Amsheet.   They declared they would keep on shelling the Christian coastdespite an ``inland truce'' proclaimed by the Arab League onThursday to halt two months of artillery duels that wreaked havocto Beirut's Moslem and Christian sectors.   No casualties were reported from today's skirmishes. By policecount, 359 people were killed and 1,393 wounded since the fightingerupted March 8 between Aoun's troops and their Syrian and Drusefoes.</TEXT></DOC>
