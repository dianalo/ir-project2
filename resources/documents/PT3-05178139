The      absorbent pad and thermal pad comprises an outer sheet made of a liquid      impermeable material and an inner sheet of a liquid permeable material. An      absorbent sheet is disposed between the inner sheet and the outer sheet. A      flexible liquid impermeable container having a chemical mixture which      undergoes a thermal reaction upon activation thereof is interposed between      the outer and inner sheets to enable the thermal source to be applied to      the patient and to enable any liquid from the patient to permeate through      the inner sheet to be absorbed by the absorbent sheet. The inner sheet of      a liquid permeable material provides a moderate insulation barrier whereas      the absorbent pad provides a substantial insulation barrier for directing      the thermal source to the patient. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  1. Field of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  This invention relates to an improved absorbent pad and thermal pack for      absorbing a liquid discharged from a patient and with improved insulation      capabilities for the thermal pack. </PAR><PAR>  2. Description of the Prior Art </PAR><PAR>  The prior art has known various types of bandages, gauze and other types of      absorbing material for absorbing blood and other fluids discharged from      the body of the patient. These devices range in size and type from very      large wraps of gauze material to small bandage type absorbent material      with attached adhesive material for securing the absorbent material in a      fixed position relative to the area of recovery of the patient. </PAR><PAR>  A specific use of these types of absorbent bandages is in the area of      obstetrics and gynecology. The prior art has known bandages which have      been specifically contoured for comfortable positioning within the area of      recovery of a obstetric or gynecological patient. Obstetric and      gynecological bandages are formed to be generally rectangular with      indentations or recesses on the opposed sides of the bandage midpoint      between the opposed ends having a general hourglass shape for a      comfortable fit for the recovering obstetric or gynecological patient.      Typically, the obstetric and gynecological bandages were worn within an      undergarment which positioned and maintained the absorbent material      proximate the recovering area of the patient. </PAR><PAR>  Others in the prior art have utilized a thermal pack proximate a recovering      area for cooling or heating the recovery area thus providing substantial      relief from pain and discomfort for the patient. One type of thermal pack      is formed from a flexible plastic container having a plurality of distinct      chemical substances. Upon mixing of the chemical substances, a chemical      reaction took place which underwent an endothermic or an exothermic      reaction. Thermal packs which undergo an endothermic reaction are      generally referred to as cold packs whereas thermal packs which undergo an      exothermic reaction are generally referred to as hot packs. In a cold      pack, heat is absorbed during the reaction of the two distinct chemical      substances. Accordingly, the container and the chemical mixture within the      container became cool relative to an ambient temperature thus absorbing      heat from the recovering area to provide a cooling comfort and relief for      the patient. The cold packs were generally positioned relative to the      patient under a conventional bandage and were retained in place by an      adhesive strip material or a strap device. </PAR><PAR>  In a similar manner, a hot pack is formed from a flexible plastic container      having a plurality of distinct chemical substances therein. Upon mixing of      the chemical substances, a chemical reaction took place which underwent an      exothermic reaction. The exothermic reaction produced heat during the      reaction of the two distinct chemical substances. Accordingly, the      container and the chemical mixture within the container became warm      relative to an ambient temperature thus adding heat to the recovering area      of the patient. </PAR><PAR>  Unfortunately, in some cases the endothermic or exothermic reaction of the      thermal pack made the thermal pack container too cold or too hot and      uncomfortable for the patient. Furthermore, when a bandage was used      simultaneously with the thermal pack, the thermal pack and the bandage      became misaligned upon movement of the patient. In other cases, the      thermal pack was retained in place by a resilient strap which was affixed      about an extremity of the patient. However, the use of the resilient strap      did not solve the problem of movement of the thermal pack relative to the      absorbent pad. </PAR><PAR>  Therefore, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide an      improved absorbent pad and thermal pack with improved capabilities and      which provides a significant advance in the bandage art. </PAR><PAR>  Another object of this invention to provide an improved absorbent pad and      thermal pack which eliminates the problems of alignment of the absorbent      pad and the thermal pack on a recovering region of a patient. </PAR><PAR>  Another object of this invention is to provide an improved absorbent pad      and thermal pack which may be manufactured at a cost commensurate with a      separate absorbent pad and a thermal pack. </PAR><PAR>  Another object of this invention is to provide an improved absorbent pad      and thermal pack which may be easily fitted and attached to a patient. </PAR><PAR>  Another object of this invention is to provide an improved absorbent pad      and thermal pack wherein the unit may be shipped as an integral unit. </PAR><PAR>  Another object of this invention is to provide an improved absorbent pad      and thermal pack which provides a moderate insulating layer interposed      between the thermal pack and the skin of the patient for providing a      moderate thermal barrier between the thermal pack and the skin of the      patient. </PAR><PAR>  Another object of this invention is to provide an improved absorbent pad      and thermal pack which provides a substantial insulating layer between the      thermal pack and the ambient for directing the thermal pack to the skin of      the patient. </PAR><PAR>  Another object of this invention is to provide an improved insulation for a      thermal pack wherein a moderate insulating layer is interposed between the      thermal pack and the skin of the patient for providing a moderate thermal      barrier and a substantial insulating layer is interposed between the      thermal pack and the ambient. </PAR><PAR>  Another object of this invention is to provide an improved insulation for a      thermal pack wherein a moderate insulating layer is interposed between the      thermal pack and the skin of the patient and a substantial insulating      layer is interposed between the thermal pack and the ambient for extending      the useful life of the thermal pack. </PAR><PAR>  The foregoing has outlined some of the more pertinent objects of the      present invention. These objects should be construed as being merely      illustrative of some of the more prominent features and applications of      the invention. Many other beneficial results can be obtained by applying      the disclosed invention in a different manner or modifying the invention      with in the scope of the invention. Accordingly other objects in a full      under standing of the invention may be had by referring to the summary of      the invention, the detailed description describing the preferred      embodiment in addition to the scope of the invention defined by the claims      taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention is defined by the appended claims with specific      embodiments being shown in the attached drawings. For the purpose of      summarizing the invention, the invention relates to a method and apparatus      for an improved absorbent pad and thermal pack including an outer sheet      made of a liquid impermeable material having an outer surface and an inner      surface. An inner sheet made of a liquid permeable material has an outer      surface and an inner surface. An absorbent sheet is disposed between the      inner sheet and the outer sheet for absorbing liquid discharged from the      patient. A thermal source comprising a flexible liquid impermeable      container containing a chemical mixture which undergoes an thermal      reaction upon activation of the chemical mixture is interposed between the      outer and inner sheets enabling the thermal source to be applied to the      patient and enabling any liquid from the patient to permeate through the      inner sheet to be absorbed by the absorbent sheet. </PAR><PAR>  In one specific embodiment of the invention, the improved absorbent pad and      thermal pack includes the outer sheet being generally elongated and      extending between a first end and a second end along the elongated      dimension. The outer sheet is generally rounded at junctures of the first      and second ends and first and second sides of the outer sheet. The outer      sheet defines a first and a second recess in the first and second sides      generally midpoint between the first and second ends whereby the      transverse dimension midpoint of the first and second ends is less than      the transverse dimension proximate the first and second ends. The inner      sheet is elongated and extends between a first end and a second end. The      inner sheet has a transverse dimension extending between a first and a      second side. An absorbent sheet is disposed between the inner sheet and      the outer sheet for absorbing liquid discharged from the patient. A      thermal source comprising a flexible liquid impermeable container      containing a chemical mixture which undergoes a thermal reaction upon      activation of the chemical mixture is interposed between the outer and      inner sheets enabling the thermal source to be applied to the patient and      enabling any liquid from the patient to permeate through the inner sheet      to be absorbed by the absorbent sheet. </PAR><PAR>  In a more specific embodiment of the invention, the first and second ends      and the first and second sides of the outer sheet define an outer sheet      perimeter whereas the first and second ends and the first and second sides      of the inner sheet define an inner sheet perimeter with the inner sheet      perimeter approximating the outer sheet perimeter. The outer sheet is      affixed to the inner sheet by adhesive means for affixing the inside      surface of the inner sheet proximate the inner sheet perimeter to the      inside surface of the outer sheet proximate the outer sheet perimeter. </PAR><PAR>  Preferably, the absorbent sheet has a generally elongated dimension      extending between a first end and a second end along the elongated      dimension of the absorbent sheet and defines a transverse dimension      extending between a first and a second side of the absorbent sheet. The      absorbent sheet may be generally rounded at junctures of the first and      second ends and the first and second sides of the absorbent sheet and may      define a first and a second recess in the first and second sides generally      midpoint between the first and second ends whereby the transverse      dimension midpoint of the first and second ends is less than the      transverse dimension proximate the first and second ends of the absorbent      sheet. The first and second ends and the first and second sides of the      absorbent sheet define an absorbent sheet perimeter with the absorbent      sheet being smaller than the inner sheet perimeter and the outer sheet      perimeter enabling the adhesive means to affix the inside surface of the      inner sheet proximate the inner sheet perimeter to the inside surface of      the outer sheet proximate the outer sheet perimeter with the absorbent      sheet being interposed therebetween. The absorbent sheet is preferably      located immediately adjacent to the inner side of the outer sheet. </PAR><PAR>  The flexible liquid impermeable container of the thermal source has an      elongated dimension and a transverse dimension defining a shape of a      generally rectangular prism with the transverse dimension of the thermal      source cooperating with the transverse dimension of the inner sheet and      the outer sheet for inhibiting transverse movement of the thermal source      within the absorbent pad. In one embodiment of the invention, adhesive      means is secured to the outer surface of the outer sheet for removably      securing the absorbent pad to an outer garment of the patient for      inhibiting movement of the absorbent pad relative to the patient. </PAR><PAR>  In another embodiment of the invention, the outer sheet is generally      circular and generally larger in diameter than a circular inner sheet. An      circular absorbent sheet is disposed between the inner sheet and the outer      sheet for absorbing liquid discharged from the patient. A thermal source      comprising a circular flexible liquid impermeable container containing a      chemical mixture which undergoes a thermal reaction upon activation of the      chemical mixture is interposed between the outer and inner sheets enabling      the thermal source to be applied to the patient and enabling any liquid      from the patient to permeate through the inner sheet to be absorbed by the      absorbent sheet. The outer periphery of the outer sheet contains an      adhesive for adhesively fastening the improved absorbent pad and thermal      pack to the patient. </PAR><PAR>  The invention is also incorporated into the method of making an improved      absorbent pad and thermal pack for absorbing liquid discharged from a      patient, comprising the steps of cutting an outer sheet from a liquid      impermeable material to have a generally elongated dimension extending      between a first end and a second end along the elongated dimension and      with a transverse dimension extending between a first and a second side of      the outer sheet. An inner sheet is cut from a liquid permeable material to      have an elongated dimension extending between a first end and a second end      and a transverse dimension extending between a first and a second side.      The first and second ends and the first and second sides of the inner      sheet is positioned adjacent the first and second ends and the first and      second sides of the outer sheet, respectively, with an absorbent sheet      disposed between the inner sheet and the outer sheet The first end and the      first and second sides of the inner sheet is affixed to the first end and      the first and second sides of the outer sheet, respectively, to form an      aperture adjacent the first ends of the inner sheet and the outer sheet. A      flexible liquid impermeable container is formed containing a chemical      mixture which undergoes a thermal reaction upon activation of the chemical      mixture. The flexible liquid impermeable container is inserted between the      inner sheet and outer sheet through the aperture adjacent the first ends      of the inner sheet and the outer sheet and the second end of the inner      sheet is affixed to the second end of the outer sheet to close the      aperture adjacent the first ends of the inner sheet and the outer sheet to      form the improved absorbent pad. The improved absorbent pad may then be      positioned relative to the patient for enabling the thermal source to be      applied to the patient and enabling liquid discharged from the patient to      permeate through the inner sheet to be absorbed by the absorbent sheet. </PAR><PAR>  The foregoing has outlined rather broadly the more pertinent and important      features of the present invention in order that the detailed description      that follows may be better understood so that the present contribution to      the art can be more fully appreciated. Additional features of the      invention will be described hereinafter which form the subject of the      claims of the invention.

It should      also be realized by those skilled in the art that such equivalent      constructions do not depart from the spirit and scope of the invention as      set forth in the appended claims. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  For a fuller understanding of the nature and objects of the invention,      reference should be made to the following detailed description taken in      connection with the accompanying drawings in which: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is an isometric view of a first embodiment of an improved absorbent      pad and thermal pack of the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a top view of the improved absorbent pad and thermal pack shown      in FIG. 1; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a sectional view along line 3--3 of FIG. 2; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a bottom view of the improved absorbent pad and thermal pack      shown in FIG. 1; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is a sectional view along line 5--5 of FIG. 2; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is an enlarged view along line 6--6 of a portion of the improved      absorbent pad and thermal pack shown in FIG. 2; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7 is an enlarged isometric view of the thermal pack removed from the      improved absorbent pad and thermal pack of FIGS. 1-6; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 8 is a top view of the thermal pack shown in FIG. 7; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 9 is a sectional view along line 9--9 of FIG. 8, and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 10 is an isometric view of a second embodiment of an improved      absorbent pad and thermal pack of the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 11 is a bottom view of the improved absorbent pad and thermal pack      shown in FIG. 10; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 12 is a sectional view of the improved absorbent pad and thermal pack      shown in FIG. 10. </PAR><PAR>  Similar reference characters refer to similar parts throughout the several      Figures of the drawings. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DISCUSSION </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is an isometric view partially cut out of an improved absorbent pad      8 of the present invention comprising an outer sheet 10 having an outer      surface 11 and an inner surface 12 fabricated from a generally flexible,      liquid permeable material such as a thermo bonded polypropylene or the      like. The outer sheet 10 has a generally elongated dimension extending      between a first end 21 and a second end 22. The outer sheet 10 has a      transverse dimension extending between a first side 31 and a second side      32. The outer sheet 10 is generally rounded at the junctures of the first      and second ends 21 and 22 and the first and second side 31 and 32 as shown      in the top and bottom views of the inventions of FIGS. 2 and 4. </PAR><PAR>  The outer sheet 10 has a first and a second recess 41 and 42 defined in the      first and second sides 31 and 32 generally midpoint between the first and      second ends 21 and 22. The transverse dimension at the midpoint 50 of the      first and second ends 21 and 22 is less than the transverse dimension      proximate the first and second ends 21 and 22. </PAR><PAR>  An inner sheet 110 has an outer surface 111 and an inner surface 112 and is      preferably made of a flexible liquid permeable material such as a      polyester or nylon. As shown in FIG. 2, the inner sheet 110 has an      elongated dimension extending between a first end 121 and a second end 122      and similarly defines a transverse dimension extending between a first and      a second side 131 and 132 respectively. In a similar manner, the inner      sheet 110 is generally rounded at the junctures of the first and second      ends 121 and 122 and the first and second sides 131 and 132 of the inner      sheet 110. The inner sheet 110 defines a first and a second recess 141 and      142 generally at a midpoint 150 between the first and second ends 121 and      122. The transverse dimension at the midpoint 150 of the first and second      ends 121 and 122 is less than the transverse dimension proximate the first      and second ends 121 and 122. </PAR><PAR>  An absorbent sheet 210 shown in phantom in FIGS. 2 and 4 and shown in      section in FIG. 3 is made of a liquid absorbent material and has an outer      surface 211 and an inner surface 212. The absorbent pad 210 extends      between a first and a second end 221 and 222 which is slightly less than      the elongated dimension of the outer sheet 10 and the inner sheet 110. The      absorbent material 210 defines a transverse dimension extending between a      first side 231 and a second side 232. </PAR><PAR>  The absorbent sheet 210 has a first and a second recess 241 and 242 defined      in the first and second sides 231 and 232 generally midpoint between the      first and second ends 221 and 222. The transverse dimension at a midpoint      of the first and second ends 221 and 222 is less than the transverse      dimension proximate the first and second ends 221 and 222. The outer      surface 211 of the absorbent material 210 is disposed adjacent the inner      surface of the outer sheet 10 as shown in FIGS. 1, 3 and 5. The transverse      dimension of the absorbent pad 210 extending between the first and the      second end 221 and 222 is slightly less than the transverse dimension of      the outer sheet 10 and the inner sheet 110 thereby defining an outer sheet      perimeters 60 of the outer sheet 10 and defining an inner sheet perimeters      160 of the inner sheet 110 as shown in FIGS. 2 and 4. </PAR><PAR>  A thermal source 310 shown more specifically in FIGS. 7-9 comprises a      flexible, liquid impermeable container 314 extending from a first end 321      to a second end 322 defining a generally elongated dimension of the      flexible container 314. The flexible container 314 also defines a      transverse dimension between a first and a second side 331 and 332. As      best shown in FIGS. 7 and 9, the flexible container 314 may be formed by      heat sealing two sheets of a flexible plastic material in seams 321A on      the first end 321, a seam 322A on the second end 322 seam 331A on the      first side 331 and a seam 332A on the second side 332 for entrapping a      chemical mixture 340 therein. The chemical mixture 340 contained within      the flexible container 314 is a mixture which undergoes a thermal reaction      upon the mixing of the two chemicals substances. The thermal reaction      produced upon the mixing of the two chemicals substances either may be an      endothermic reaction (heat absorbing) or may be an exothermic reaction      (heat producing). Substances that are suitable for use in the flexible      container for cold pack or an endothermic reaction are sodium nitrate and      water as shown be well known to those skilled in the art. Substances that      are suitable for use in the flexible container for heat pack or an      exothermic reaction are magnesium sulfate anhydrous, colloidal clay and      water as shown be well known to those skilled in the art. It should be      also appreciated that various other chemical formulations may be used      within the flexible container 314 of the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  The thermal pack 310 forms a generally rectangular prism with a      substantially constant transverse dimension between the first and second      sides 331 and 332. The transverse dimension of the flexible container 314      is generally commensurate with the transverse dimension of the outer and      inner sheets 10 and 110 proximate the midpoints 50 and 150. As best shown      in FIGS. 1, 3 and 5, the thermal pack 310 is disposed within the improved      absorbent pad 8 immediately adjacent the inner sheet 110. </PAR><PAR>  The improved absorbent pad and cold pack 8 of the present invention is      assembled in the relationship shown in FIGS. 1-6. The outer surface 211 of      the absorbent pad 210 is preferably affixed to the inner surface 12 of the      outer sheet 10 by suitable means such as heat sealing, gluing and the like      for maintaining the position of the absorbent material 210 relative to the      outer sheet 10. The thermal pack 310 is interposed between the inner      surface 212 of the absorbent pad and the inner surface 112 of the inner      sheet 110 as best shown in FIGS. 1, 3 and 5. The outer sheet perimeter 60      of the outer sheet 10 is sealed to the inner sheet perimeter 160 of the      inner sheet 110. </PAR><PAR>  As best shown in FIGS. 6, the perimeters 60 and 160 are preferably      adhesively affixed to one another by the introduction of an interposed      adhesive 70 between the inner surface 12 of the outer sheet 10 and the      inner surface 112 of the inner sheet 110. Since the absorbent material 210      is smaller than the inner and outer sheets 10 and 110, the absorbent      material 210 does not form a part of the affixing of the outer sheet 10 to      the inner sheet 110. </PAR><PAR>  Since the elongated longitudinal dimension between the first and second      ends 321 and 322 of the flexible container 314 is smaller than the      elongated dimension between the first and second ends 21 and 22 of the      outer sheet 10 and the first and second ends 121 and 122 of the inner      sheet 110, the thermal pack 210 will migrate to the proper position when      the absorbent pad 8 is worn by a user in the event that the improved      absorbent pad 8 is not properly positioned by the user. Furthermore, since      the transverse dimension of the container 314 is generally commensurate      with the transverse dimension at the midpoints 50 and 150 of the outer      sheet 10 and the inner sheet 110, the flexible container 314 is restricted      from lateral movement within the improved absorbent pad 8. </PAR><PAR>  Adhesive means 400 may be optionally included on the outer surface 11 of      the outer sheet 10 for removably affixing the improved absorbent pad 8 to      an inside surface of an undergarment of the user. </PAR><PAR>  The invention is also incorporated into the method of making the improved      absorbent pad 8 for absorbing liquid discharged from a patient, comprising      the steps of cutting the outer sheet 10 from a liquid impermeable material      to have a generally elongated dimension extending between the first end 21      and the second end 22 along the elongated dimension and with a transverse      dimension extending between the first side 31 and the second side 32 of      the outer sheet 10. The inner sheet 110 is cut from a liquid permeable      material to have an elongated dimension extending between a first end 121      and a second end 122 and a transverse dimension extending between the      first side 131 and the second side 132. The first and second ends 21 and      22 and the first and second sides 31 and 32 of the inner sheet 10 is      positioned adjacent the first and second ends 121 and 122 and the first      and second sides 131 and 132 of the outer sheet 110, respectively, with      the absorbent sheet 310 disposed between the inner sheet 110 and the outer      sheet 10. The first end 121 and the first and second sides 131 and 132 of      the inner sheet 110 is affixed to the first end 21 and the first and      second sides 31 and 32 of the outer sheet 10, respectively, to form an      aperture (not shown) adjacent the second end 132 of the inner sheet 110      and the second end 32 of the outer sheet 10. The flexible liquid      impermeable container 314 contains a chemical mixture which undergoes an      endothermic reaction upon activation of the chemical mixture. The flexible      liquid impermeable container 314 is inserted between the inner sheet 110      and outer sheet 10 through the aperture adjacent the second end 132 of the      inner sheet 110 and the second end 32 of the outer sheet 10. The second      end 132 of the inner sheet 110 is affixed to the second end 32 of the      outer sheet 10 to close the aperture (not shown) adjacent the second end      132 of the inner sheet 110 and the second end 32 of the outer sheet 10 to      form the improved absorbent pad 8. </PAR><PAR>  Preferably, the outer sheet 10 is cut to define the first and second      recesses 41 and 42 in the first and second sides 31 and 32 at the midpoint      50 between the first and second ends 21 and 22. In a similar manner, the      inner sheet 110 is cut to define the first and the second recess 141 and      142 in the first and second sides 131 and 132 at the midpoint 150 between      the first and second ends 121 and 122. The first end 121 and the first and      second sides 131 and 132 of the inner sheet 110 is preferably glued to the      first end 21 and the first and second sides 31 and 32 Of the outer sheet      10. Similarly, the second end 122 of the inner sheet 110 is glued to the      second end 22 of the outer sheet 10 after the flexible liquid impermeable      container 314 is inserted between the inner sheet 110 and outer sheet 10      through the aperture. An adhesive 400 may be secured to the outer surface      11 of the outer sheet 10 for removably securing the absorbent pad 8 to an      outer garment of the patient for inhibiting movement of the absorbent pad      relative to the patient. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 10-12 illustrate a second embodiment of the improved absorbent pad      and thermal pack 408 of the present invention comprising an outer sheet      410 having an outer surface 411 and an inner surface 412 fabricated from a      generally flexible, liquid permeable material. The outer sheet 410 is      generally circular having an outer sheet perimeter 460. An inner sheet 510      has an outer surface 511 and an inner surface 512 and is preferably made      of a flexible liquid permeable material such as a polyester or nylon. The      inner sheet 510 is generally circular having an inner sheet perimeter 560      which is less than the outer sheet perimeter 460 of the outer sheet 410. </PAR><PAR>  An absorbent sheet 610 is made of a liquid absorbent material and has an      outer surface 611 and an inner surface 612. The absorbent pad 610 is      circular and has a perimeter which is slightly less than the inner sheet      perimeter 560 of the inner sheet 510. The outer surface 611 of the      absorbent material 610 is disposed adjacent the inner surface 4 2 of the      outer sheet 410 as shown in FIG. 12. </PAR><PAR>  A thermal source 710 comprising a flexible, liquid impermeable container      714 is generally circular and commensurate in perimeter to the perimeter      of the absorbent pad 610. The flexible container 714 may be formed by heat      sealing two sheets of a flexible plastic material in seams as heretofore      described for entrapping a chemical mixture 740 therein. The chemical      mixture 740 undergoes a thermal reaction upon the mixing of the chemicals      substances. </PAR><PAR>  The outer surface 611 of the absorbent pad 610 is affixed to the inner      surface 412 of the outer sheet 410 by suitable means such as heat sealing,      gluing and the like. The thermal pack 710 is interposed between the inner      surface 612 of the absorbent pad 610 and the inner surface 512 of the      inner sheet 510. The outer sheet 410 is sealed to the inner sheet 510 by      means such as adhesive means 470 or the like. </PAR><PAR>  Adhesive means 800 is disposed on the inner surface 411 of outer sheet      perimeter 460 of the outer sheet for affixing the improved absorbent pad      408 to the user. The adhesive means 800 allows the improved absorbent pad      and thermal pack 408 to be used on and affixed to substantially any skin      portion of a patent with the use of additional garments or other support      devices. </PAR><PAR>  The inner sheet of the present invention provides a moderate insulating      layer interposed between the thermal pack and the skin of the patient. The      moderate thermal barrier between the thermal pack and the skin of the      patient eliminates the direct contact of the thermal pack with the skin of      the patient. The absorbent pad provides a substantial insulating layer      between the thermal pack and the ambient, that is, away from the skin of      the patient. </PAR><PAR>  The combination of the moderate insulating layer of the inner sheet and the      substantial insulating layer of the absorbent pad provides several unique      and unexpected benefits over the prior art. First, the moderate insulating      layer of the inner sheet makes the application of either cold or hot more      comfortable for the patient since there is no direct contact of the      thermal pack with the skin of the patient. Second, the moderate insulating      layer of the inner sheet directs the cold or heat from the thermal pack      toward the skin of the patient at a rate slower than a conventional cold      pack. Third, the substantial insulating layer of the absorbent pad      inhibits the flow of cold or heat between the thermal pack and the      ambient. Fourth, the combination of the moderate insulating layer of the      inner sheet and the substantial insulating layer of the absorbent pad      extends the useful life of the thermal pack by the inner sheet retarding      the flow of cold or heat between the thermal pack and the skin of the      patient and by the absorbent pad inhibiting the flow of cold or heat      between the thermal pack and the ambient. </PAR><PAR>  The improved absorbent pad of the present invention has found to be      effective during the recovery of post-natal operations as well as other      gynecological operations. The improved pad and thermal pack provides both      an absorbent media for absorbing a liquid discharged from a patient as      well as providing cooling or heating for a treated area by virtue of the      combined thermal pack within the improved absorbent pad. Since the inner      sheet provides a moderate amount of insulation value, the thermal surface      of the flexible plastic container is not directly applied to the skin of      the patient, thus making the device more suitable for use than the prior      art devices. Furthermore, the substantial insulation valve of the      absorbent pad enhances the effectiveness of the thermal pack. </PAR><PAR>  The present disclosure includes that contained in the appended claims as      well as that of the foregoing description. Although this invention has      been described in its preferred form with a certain degree of      particularity, it is understood that the present disclosure of the      preferred form has been made only by way of example and that numerous      changes in the details of construction and the combination and arrangement      of parts may be resorted to without departing from the spirit and scope of      the invention. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
