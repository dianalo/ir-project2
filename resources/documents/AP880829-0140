Exploratory drilling began three weeks ago on a permit grantedto the company, Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine, for theParis-Isle-de-France region.   ``After the seismic tests we did, we figured we would findsomething,'' said Thomas Saunders, a spokesman for the oil company.``But we thought there was maybe one chance out of six or seven.Everybody's very pleased, of course, that we found something thefirst time.''   Elf Aquitaine holds a 50 percent share of the permit withTotal-Compagnie Francaises des Petroles owning 35 percent andBritish Petroleum France holding the rest. The permit was awardedin December 1985.   The Elf-Total-BP joint venture has already spent $11.6 millionon the permit to drill, most of it for seismic tests, said Elf'schief of French operations, Bruno Weymuller.   ``It was important to find oil to show that we are right to bedrilling in the region,'' said Patrick Oberto, director ofexploration for BP France.   The Paris Basin, which contains 6.36 million barrels of knownoil reserves, 48 operating wells and about 600 exploratory wells,has a discovery rate of 1 in 12 wells. The Paris Basin extends over50,000 square miles from Paris east to West Germany.   The first Paris well produced oil with small quantities of waterduring a test at a depth of 1,972 yards. The well was drilled inthe suburb of Ivry, on the left bank of the Seine River about 500yards from the elevated freeway that encircles Paris.   Ivry 101 was drilled at an angle and the oil-bearing rock wasstruck under an apartment building across the Seine in the adjacentsuburb of Alfortville, the company said.   Saunders said the oil was found Friday and that tests on Sundayconfirmed oil was present in the rock. More tests will be conductedover the next 10 days to determine the quality of the oil and theextent of the find.   ``We haven't found a lagoon of oil, this isn't Texas. It is allimpregnated in stone and we need to figure out if it will beeconmically feasible to produce it,'' Saunders said.   About 10 million people live in the 587 square miles covered bythe permit.   Ivry 101 is the first of several exploratory wells to be drilledin the suburbs to the north, south and east of Paris. About 60workers remain at the site and drilling continues around the clock,the company said.</TEXT></DOC>
