At least 60 government soldiers and civilians in Svay Chek werekilled in the attack Sunday morning, said Gen. Pan Thai, chief ofstaff of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front.   ``We control 70 percent of the town of Svay Chek right now,'' hesaid at Prasat, a command post near the Thai border. ``We will forsure take the whole town, probably tonight.''   The guerrillas said they intercepted radio messages in which thegovernment defenders requested permission to withdraw at 11 a.m.,six hours after the latest guerrilla assault, but were told to waitfor reinforcements.   Thai military intelligence sources confirmed most of theguerrilla claims.   The guerrillas said a convoy of government tanks, trucks andarmored personnel carriers withdrew south toward Sisophon on Sundaymorning but halted after going about five miles.   Sisophon, a government military operations center about 13 milessouth of Svay Chek, is the guerrillas' ultimate objective. Itscapture would be the biggest victory of the 11-year-old war againstthe Vietnamese-installed government.   The Khmer People's National Liberation Front and two otherguerrilla groups allied with it are supplied by China and othercountries. The government is armed mainly by the Soviet Union.   Guerrillas of the front captured areas north of Svay Chek inlate September, only days after Vietnam claimed it had withdrawnits last troops from the country.   Thousands of rounds of rockets and artillery have been exchangedin recent days as guerrillas advanced toward the town through thesurrounding rice fields.   The guerrillas cut off the government's only remaining supplyroute to Svay Chek, Route 69, in fighting Friday.   Guerrilla commanders at the scene said the government Thursdayincreased the number of defenders at Svay Chek to 2,000 by trucking800 more soldiers just hours before Route 69 was cut.   The guerrillas said they have opened infiltration routes byusing sticks and knives to clear minefields surrounding the town.   ``Men were assigned one square meter of ground each to dig upthe mines during the night,'' Pan Thai said.   He said his forces destroyed one tank and an armored personnelcarrier with newly acquired Swedish anti-tank weapons.   The guerrillas said more than 7,000 civilians had been living inSvay Chek but most of them fled in recent days.   The guerrillas said they spoke with the government soldiers atSvay Chek during the assaults.   ``We will kill you if you don't leave now,'' one guerrillacommander told the soldiers holed up in the southern part of thetown.   ``You live in the jungle. You do not know how to run thecountry,'' the other side responded.   Most of the war has been limited to a slice of territorybordering Thailand. The capital of Phnom Penh has been almostuntouched by fighting.   But the Khmer Rouge, who are allied with the liberation front,claimed in a radio broadcast Saturday they lobbed several grenadesat a monastery and other areas of Phnom Penh on Tuesday andWednesday.   ``Some enemies were killed or wounded in these grenade attacks.The enemies are in great alarm,'' claimed the broadcast, a text ofwhich was seen in Bangkok on Sunday.   There was no way to confirm the report. Some previous KhmerRouge claims of attacks on cities were proven false.   The Khmer Rouge ruled for nearly four years and committedwidespread massacres before they were ousted by Vietnam's invasionin late 1978.</TEXT></DOC>
