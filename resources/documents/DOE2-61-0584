MR diagnosed the condition as well as CT in all cases,but proved superior to CT in delineating the anatomical relationshipof the vessels to the neural structures. MR proved especially usefulin cases of VBD-associated hydrocephalus and posterior fossa masses.A coexisting tumor was diagnosed by MR in one case.</TEXT></DOC>
