Please come pick it up,'' says an announcer 20 miles awayin San Miguel while reading the list of residents favored by thelatest international courier delivery.   Every single family here has at least one relative living in theWashington area. One resident says almost as many Intipuquenos havegone to Washington as remained behind.   The chain-reaction from one resident's journey 22 years ago hasmade Intipuca an island of prosperity in a sea of backwardness.   It also underscores the dependence of tens of thousands ofSalvadoran families _ and the national economy as a whole _ onmoney sent by relatives working in the United States.   The amount sent back to this tiny, war-ravaged Central Americancountry from about 500,000 Salvadorans who emigrated northward isbelieved to roughly equal annual U.S. economic aid to El Salvador,which stands at $433 million.   The signs of Intipuca's properity are everywhere. Televisionantennae sprout from almost all its red tile roofs, which sit atopdecorous, brightly painted homes. Even late-model Japanese pickupsand four-wheel drive vehicles _ some with Virginia or District ofColumbia plates _ are parked on the streets.   The land around Intipuca, in the easternmost province of LaUnion, is no more fertile than elsewhere in El Salvador.   It provides enough corn and beans to keep hunger at bay.However, there is no way to escape the poverty, unemployment,disease and ignorance that characterize the lives of most ruralSalvadorans.   This town is better off than its neighbors for one main reason:Sigifrido Chavez ventured to Washington in 1967.   Things went well there for the industrious young man, whostarted out washing dishes, moved on to construction and eventuallystarted a small business.   He returned to Intipuca a year after leaving, but only to visit,show off his new wardrobe and take back his brother to Washington.Before long, young men and women were taking advantage of the era'sfreely granted visas and emigrating there by the score in hopes ofgetting ahead.   Most of them did.   ``It's because of the unity, the solidarity among Intipuquenosthat they have done well. One helps another, he helps the next, andso on,'' said Maximiliano Arias.   Arias, who heads the town council that decides how to spendcommunal funds sent by a Washington committee of Intipuquenos, saidIntipuca's latest census shows a population of just over 11,000.   ``That's about how many Intipuquenos we calculate are inWashington,'' said Arias, who has two sons there.   He said the U.S. connection provides an estimated $100,000 amonth family-to-family and several thousand dollars more a year infunds for community projects.   The Intipuca community in Washington holds dances and barbecuesat which donations are made for the hometown.   Such contributions paved the town's streets and renovated thechurch and school. Current projects include construction of abasketball court and establishment of a rehabilitation center forhandicapped children.   In September 1983, the town was overrun and held for a day byleftist guerrillas. Nearly 10 years of revolution have providedother reasons to emigrate.   Domitila Blanco's daughter, Flor, and her son, Julian, left inthe six months after the guerrilla raid. The period marked a surgein emigration.   Mrs. Blanco runs a dry goods store and letter-forwarding servicein Intipuca. She praises the U.S. connection.   ``Before, people were so poor here they would go to the sea tofish for crabs. Now they walk around in coats and ties,'' she said.   Her daughter married a U.S.-born son of an Intipuqueno coupleand lives in condominium in Arlington, Va.   However, she still misses her departed children and says her twochildren still at home will not go north. ``As long as I have lifein me, I'll not let them go to the United States,'' she said.   In an case, visas are nearly impossible to obtain these days.Town council member Julio Benitez says the flow of emigrants fromIntipuca slowed dramatically since the 1986 reform of U.S.immigration laws.</TEXT></DOC>
