He was reacting to a bill passed Tuesday by the House ForeignAffairs Committee, which now heads for debate in the full House.   Redman said the trade sanctions against South Africa legislatedin 1986 by Congress ``have not led to significant positive changesin South Africa and we don't believe that additional ones are anymore likely to succeed.''   He said the administration had been lobbying Congress againstthe bill and would continue to argue its position.</TEXT></DOC>
