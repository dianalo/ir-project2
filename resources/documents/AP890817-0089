(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Seventy-two-year-old Gertrude Eberlyhad been retired for nine years, living in Nevada on a modestpension when the state of California dunned her for nearly $4,000.   Even though Eberly had moved from California in 1978, theFranchise Tax Board sent the former state worker a bill in December1987 for back taxes, interest and penalties on her Californiapension for 1981-86.   After exhausting appeals to the tax board and state and federalpoliticians, Eberly arranged to pay. California allowed her to make$50 monthly installments to accommodate her annual pension andSocial Security income of less than $13,000.   But in pursuing the money, California unwittingly fueled agrowing grassroots campaign against what Eberly and other pensionersnationwide say is unfair taxation by 13 states.   ``I was just totally overcome and so helpless,'' Eberly said in atelephone interview from her home in Fallon, Nev., where she movedto be near her daughter's family after retiring with 31 yearsservice in the California Employment Development Department.   ``I wrote, I think it was 120 letters to senators andrepresentatives and advocacy agencies for the elderly. I got sevenreplies. In those, they said, `Well, this is not our problem.'''   Her Nevada representatives told her that since it was aCalifornia tax, she should write to Gov. George Deukmejian.Deukmejian's office politely suggested she write her Nevadarepresentatives.   ``I had no representation. That's when I got angry and decided itwas unconstitutional.''   California is one of 13 states that collect a ``source tax'' onpensions sent outside their borders, said Bill Hoffman, head of agroup called Retirees to Eliminate State Income Source Tax, orRESIST.   The other states are Arkansas, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland,Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Utah, Vermont andVirginia, Hoffman said. North Carolina recently approved a similartax and several other states are poised to do so, he said.   RESIST members complain they are paying taxes to states wherethey are no longer residents, can't vote and don't use the freewaysand other tax-financed services.   ``Of course the biggest objection to this tax is that it'staxation without representation,'' Hoffman said. ``I have no controlover it. They could double or triple or quadruple the tax and Icouldn't do anything about it.''   Hoffman, 57, a retired aerospace engineer, founded RESIST lastsummer after he and his wife, Joanne, moved from Torrance to CarsonCity, Nev., only to find they still had to pay California taxes.Nevada has no state income tax.   The loose-knit organization now has chapters in at least 35states, with about 8,000 members who are lobbying for federallegislation to outlaw the tax.   Their tax revolt is a law-abiding one. Like Eberly, most end uppaying the tax, albeit under protest, Hoffman and tax officials said.   According to tax officials, source tax on nonresidents is legaland fair.   Pensioners weren't taxed on the income when it went into theirretirement accounts, but are obligated to pay the tax once theycollect retirement _whether they still live in the state or not.   ``We are not taxing people without representation,'' said JimReber, a spokesman for the Franchise Tax Board. ``They wererepresented when they made that income.''   California source tax dates to 1935, but the state has stepped upenforcement in recent years largely because of new, moresophisticated computer records to track potential taxpayers, Rebersaid.   In 1986, the state collected $7 million from 33,000 nonresidentswho filed returns reporting pensions and annuities from California,he said. That compares with $409 million in income taxes onannuities and pensions reported by 1.6 million Californians duringthe same year.   ``The concept is this _ all during the time you were working inCalifornia you were receiving a professional tax break on deferredincome,'' Reber said.   ``It was money that was never taxed in the first place. ... Nowthat you're retired, the state wants it's fair share of that tax.''   California has agreements with other states that levy income taxto prevent double taxation on the pensions.   California only taxes income earned within the state, but itcalculates the tax rate based on total income, which cansubstantially raise the tax bill if the retiree has other income.The new home state may do the same. Critics say the result is, ineffect, double taxation.   Retirees with California pensions say their former home statenever told them about the tax before sending them bills that includelate penalties of 55 percent and interest of 10 percent to 13percent.   ``If indeed they were going to do this to us, somebody shouldhave told us,'' Hoffman said. ``And I think they should have givenus some options. Maybe we could have paid the taxes as we wentalong.''</TEXT></DOC>
