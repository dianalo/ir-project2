The deployment of ion beams in theseareas has occurred in three phases: first the exploitation of keV ionbeams (in ion implantation and SIMS) then MeV light ion beams (usingRBS, NRA, PIXE analysis and TLA) and currently MeV heavy ion beams, togetherwith the associated fast recoil atoms and nuclei that they produce ininteractions with materials. This trend has been accompanied by the gradualassimilation of methods such as energy analysis, microbeam focusing,particle identification, time of flight and coincidence techniques, etc.,which were first developed for experimental nuclear physics use. Currentexamples of developments in the MeV range relevant to phases 2 and 3are given.</TEXT></DOC>
