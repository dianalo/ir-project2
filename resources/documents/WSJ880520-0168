Both companies said they were aided by low Japanese interest rates and increased government lending, which spurred housing construction. Building rentals were strong, reflecting the nation's economic expansion. The companies said they expect a further improvement in results this year as interest rates remain low and economic growth continues.    Mitsui Real Estate's unconsolidated net rose 22% in the fiscal year, to 18.66 billion yen ($149.5 million) from 15.26 billion yen a year earlier, as sales grew 23%, to 394.87 billion yen ($3.16 billion) from 320.71 billion yen. In the current fiscal year, Mitsui Real Estate expects net to rise to 21 billion yen and sales to 460 billion yen.    Sumitomo Realty posted a 39% increase in net, to 10.66 billion yen from 7.69 billion yen, and a 37% gain in sales, to 124.85 billion yen from 91.05 billion yen. It expects net of 12.50 billion yen in the current year and sales of 150 billion yen. </TEXT></DOC>
