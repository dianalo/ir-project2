 In the recent Supreme Court ofcanada decision in Stewart v.andP;  The Queen, the answer was &quot;no&quot;.andM;In the Stewart case, a union was attempting to organize the employees of theConstellation Hotel in Toronto.andP;  The hotel had a policy that the names,addresses and telephone numbers of its employees were to be keptconfidential, and as a result the union was unable to obtain them.andM;The union hired a self-employed consultant, named Stewart, to acquire thisinformation.andP;  Stewart approached a security guard at the hotel to obtain it,knowing that this information was confidential and that the guard would notnormally have access to it.andM;The guard reported the incident and a subsequent telephone conversationbetween the guard and Stewart was recorded to catch Stewart 'red-handed'.andO;Stewart was charged with counselling a party to commit theft and fraud, underthe Canadian Criminal Code.andM;In a somewhat surprising decision, the Supreme Court of Canada held thatconfidential information, which includes know-how and trade secrets, cannotbe &quot;stolen&quot; under the Criminal Code and that Stewart had not committed acrime of either theft or fraud, even if he had succeeded in obtaining theconfidential information.andM;The court said that confidential information is not property for the purposesof th Criminal Code, but rather an intangible.andP;  As a consequence,confidential information cannot be taken or converted as is the case withproperty, as the owner is not deprived of the confidential information aftera copy has been taken.andP;  As an example, if a disk containing confidentialinformation is stolen, it is only the disk itself that is the stolenproperty, and not the confidential information.andM;This results in the rather bizarre situation that if an unauthorizied personenters your premises and copies all of your software source code or othertrade secrets, using his own disk or paper, there is no theft under theCriminal Code as no property is taken.andM;This is different from the situation where confidential information isdisclosed by you in confidence to another party who subsequently disclosesit.andP;  In that situation, the courts provide some protection based on theproposition that, a person who is given information in confidence may nottake unfair advantage of it to the detriment of the owner.andM;You will note that none of these apply in the case of an outsider copyingyour confidential information as there is no relationship with the owner.andM;This leads to the question.andP;  How can Iprotect confidential information?andP;  Theanswer includes:andM;* controls on confidential information;andM;* employee confidentiality agreements;andM;* copyright; and,andM;* intellectual property registrations.andM;ControlsandM;Unlike patents, industrial designs and copyright where you can obtainprotection by registration, confidential information can only be protected bybeing kept secret.andM;As a result, a company must closely control its confidential information.andO;The following steps are suggested to protect confidential information:andM;* A company should restrict access to offices where confidential informationis stored.andP;  This should include restricted access via a computer link, withappropriate security both for employees and outsiders who may try to gainaccess.andM;* Confidential information should be reduced to print and conspicuouslymarked &quot;confidential&quot; so all who use it are aware of its nature.andM;* Confidential information should be stored in a secure location, ideallyseparate from other non-confidential information.andP;  You should not, forexample, store it on a local area network (LAN), where all users may haveaccess to it.andM;* Only persons with a need-to-know should be authorized to access it.andM;* Confidential information should never be disclosed to outsiders, unles aconfidentiality agreement has been signed.andP;  This would include plant tourswhere confidential information can be viewed in use.andM;* All employees should be made aware of the value of confidential informationand be encouraged to report any suspicious activities, as loss of it couldjeopardize their jobs.andM;* All company brochures, support material or other technical documentationmust be screened to ensure that they do not contain confidential information.andM;With the above measures in place, you will be in a good position to maintainprotection of your confidential information.andM;As confidential information cannot be stolen in the normal way, rights basedon contract are an excellent way to protect it from being taken by employees.andO;If an employee signs an employment agreement in which he acknowledges thecompany's confidential information, agrees not to disclose or use it (bothduring and after his employment), the company ahs a legal right upon which tosue the employee (and perhaps his new employer) if confidential informationis taken.andM;In addition, an employee contract may also be used to conveniently obligatethe employee to assign all inventions, industrial designs, and copyright thathe creates to the company, and to waive all employee &quot;moral rights&quot; incopyright as discussed below.andM;Under our new Copyright Act, there are now new cmoral rights&quot; which a creatorof a copyright work automatically acquires upon creating the work.andM;These rights allow a creator to prevent the work from being:andM;* distorted, mutilated or otherwise modified; or,andM;* used in association with a product, service, cause or institution to theprejudice of the honor or reputation of the creator.andM;As these rights may be broadly interpreted by the courts, an employee shouldbe required to waive all moral rights (they cannot be assigned) in anemployment contract.andM;If not waived, a company may discover that it had violated an employee'smoral rights and as a result be liable in damages to a disgruntled employee.andO;For example, moral rights may come into play if the employee is a pacifist,and th company modifies a software program which the employee helped create,to adapt it for a military purpose.andM;Copyright provides the owner with the sole right to produce or reproduce thework.andP;  As a result, if an unauthorized person made a copy of yourconfidential information, you may sue for copyright infringement.andM;In such an action, you could obtain an injunction preventing further copying,an accounting of profits made by the infringer, and damages suffered by you,as owner of the copyright.andP;  In addition, all infringing copies would becomethe property of the copyright owner.andP;  This would appear to be an effectivemeans of protecting confidential information.andP;  But is it really?andM;Copyright only protects the &quot;expression&quot; of an idea, but not the &quot;idea&quot;itself.andP;  If another party rewrites your confidential information, in wordssubstantially different from the original, then the rewritten version wouldnot be considered a &quot;copy&quot; and would, therefore, not infringe your copyright.andM;Intellectual propertyandM;Intellectual property in relation to confidential information includespatents, industrial designs and copyright.andP;  If confidential informationcontains an invention or design, you may want to consider applying for patentor industrial design protection (copyright protection is automatic).andO;Although you must disclose your confidential information in the application,once you obtain a patent or industrial design registration, you have amonopoly for 20 years for a patent or 10 years for an industrial design.andM;The disadvantages are that a competitor can look for ways to circumvent thepatent, and that confidential information may be protected for more than 20years if continuously kept secret.andM;On the other hand, a patent removes the onerous burden of keeping informationsecret and removes the worry that another party may independently discover,use and disclose your confidential information.andM;As technology becomes more complex and requires larger expenditures ofcapital to develop, in addition to the marketing trend towards world marketsand free trade, the importance of confidential information will becomegreater in the 1990s.andP;  As a result, the need to protect it will also becomemore important.andM;Gordon Buchan is an associate with the law firm Fraser andamp; Beatty, specializingin technology and intellectual property law.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
