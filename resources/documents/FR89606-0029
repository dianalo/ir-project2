Sadler, General Attorney,Railroad Retirement Board, 844 Rush Street, Chicago, Illinois 60611, (312)751-4513 (FTS 386-4513).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The Railroad Retirement Act (45 U.S.C.231 <T3>et seq.</T3>) provides a system of retirement and disability benefitsfor railroad employees, their spouses, children, and survivors who meetcertain eligibility requirements under that Act. The Railroad RetirementBoard's regulations regarding family relationships are currently locatedin Parts 216 and 219. These regulations were issued in February 1982 anddo not take into account the categories of beneficiaries which were addedby the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (Pub. L. 97-35); namelydivorced spouses, surviving divorced spouses and remarried widow(er)s.The proposed regulation incorporates the provisions regarding family relationshipscurrently contained in Parts 216 and 219 into one new Part 222, and addsprovisions pertaining to the classes of beneficiaries created by the 1981Amendments to the Railroad Retirement Act. The phrase ``family relationship''generally pertains to a relationship to a railroad employee which has beencreated by marriage, divorce, birth, adoption, or dependency. Both Parts216 and 219 are also currently under extensive revision and when publishedas final rules will reflect that all definitions regarding family relationshipsare now contained in Part 222. The Bureau of Law within the Railroad Retirement Board is currently involvedin a project to revise all regulations for which the agency has responsibility.It is the aim of the project to incorporate the latest legislative, legaland policy changes while using plain language in order to make the regulationseasier to use and understand. As a result, this part has been written tobe an integral part of the planned revised and reorganized regulationsand may, in certain instances, refer to parts of regulations which arenot currently in effect. The Railroad Retirement Board believes that anyminor inconveniences that might arise as a result of publishing the regulationson a part-by-part basis are outweighed by the benefits derived from publishingcurrent, more easily usable and understandable regulations on a consistentbasis. The Board has determined that this is not a major rule for purposes ofExecutive Order 12291. Therefore, no regulatory impact analysis is required.In addition, this rule does not impose any information collections withinthe meaning of the Papework Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Ch. 35). <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 20 CFR Part 222 </ITAG>Railroad employees, Railroad retirement, Family relationships.For the reasons set out in the preamble, Title 20, Chapter II of the Codeof Federal Regulations is proposed to be amended by adding Part 222, FamilyRelationships, to read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 222_FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart A_General </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">222.1 Introduction. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">222.2 Definitions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">222.3 Other regulations related to this part. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">222.4 Homicide of employee. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart B_Relationship as Wife, Husband or Widow(er) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">222.10 When determinations of relationship as wife, husband, widowor widower of employer are made. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">222.11 Determination of marriage relationship. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">222.12 Ceremonial marriage relationship.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">222.13 Common-law marriage relationship. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">222.14 Deemed marriage relationship. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">222.15 When spouse is living with employee. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">222.16 When spouse is living in the same household with employee.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">222.17 ``Child in care'' when child of the employee is living withthe claimant. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">222.18 ``Child in care'' when child of the employee is not livingwith the claimant. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="76">Subpart C_Relationship as Divorced Spouse, Surviving Divorced Spouse,or Remarried Widow(er) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">222.20 When determination of relationship as divorced spouse, survivingdivorced spouse, or remarried widow(er) is made.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">222.21 When marriage is terminated by final divorce.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">222.22 Relationship as divorced spouse.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">222.23 Relationship as surviving divorced spouse.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">222.24 Relationship as remarried widow(er).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart D_Relationship as Child</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">222.30 When determinations of relationships as child are made.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">222.31 Relationship as child for annuity and lump-sum payment purposes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">222.32 Relationship as a natural child.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">222.33 Relationship resulting from legal adoption.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">222.34 Relationship resulting from equitable adoption.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">222.35 Relationship as stepchild.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">222.36 Relationship as grandchild or stepgrandchild.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="76">Subpart E_Relationship as Parent, Grandchild, Brother or Sister</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">222.40 When determinations of relationship are made for parent, grandchild,brother or sister.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">222.41 Determination of relationship and support for parent.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">222.42 When employee is contributing to support.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">222.43 How the one-half support determination is made.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">222.44 Other relationship determinations for lump-sum payments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart F_Child Support and Dependency</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">222.50 When child dependency determinations are made.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">222.51 When a natural child is dependent.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">222.52 When a legally adopted child is dependent_general.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">222.53 When a legally adopted child is dependent_child adopted afterentitlement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">222.54 When a legally adopted child is dependent_grandchild or stepgrandchildadopted after entitlement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">222.55 When a stepchild is dependent.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">222.56 When a grandchild or stepgrandchild is dependent.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">222.57 When an equitably adopted child is dependent.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">222.58 When a child is living with an employee.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>45 U.S.C. 231f.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart A_General</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 222.1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Introduction.</ITAG>This part sets forth and describes the family relationships that may makea claimant eligible for an annuity or lump-sum payment under the RailroadRetirement Act and furnishes the basic rules for determining when thoserelationships exist.
