Just a day after an agreement was reached, Kuwaiti Oil MinisterAli Khalifa al-Sabah said his country has temporarily withdrawn fromOPEC's quota system because other ministers failed to increase itsshare of total production in the last half of the year.   Other members of the 13-nation Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries appeared to accept Kuwait's decision to cheat onthe new agreement.   In fact, the United Arab Emirates and a few others wereconsidered likely to ignore their output limits. They, too, wanted abigger share of the production pie.   But Algeria's Sadek Boussena said, ``I think that all countrieshave committed themselves to something. That's what's positive.''   It was Kuwait's insistence on a higher share of increasedproduction that stalled negotiations for a new accord.   Sabah said he wrote in the new agreement that he would not feelbound by his new quota. But he also told reporters that Kuwait``will use that freedom (from the quota system) very, veryresponsibly.''   In restraining supply in the past, he said, Kuwait has``sacrificed more than the others for a very, very long time. ...But there is a limit to what we can do.''   Sabah said Kuwait intended to produce 1.35 million barrels a dayin the coming months, noting that it is ``almost physicallyimpossible'' to pump less than that in part because of commitmentsto long-time customers. Kuwait's new new quota is 1.09 millionbarrels, and its current supply is estimated at nearly 2 millionbarrels.   Saudi Arabia's Hisham Nazer indicated to a small group ofreporters that Kuwait's extra sales would be tolerated as long asthey did not exceed 1.35 million barrels a day.   Indonesia's Ginandjar Kartasasmita noted Kuwait would have tomake cutbacks to come down to the promised level.   ``The accord is even better than what we could have dreamed of,''he said. ``This is the maximum that we could have.''   After six days of bargaining, the cartel agreed to boost itssupply ceiling to 19.5 million barrels a day in the July-Decemberperiod. While that is up a million barrels from the current officiallevel, analysts estimated output in recent weeks has risen to 21million barrels a day.   The ministers agreed to divide the extra sales proportionatelyamong all members. To meet the new ceiling, some countries will haveto cut production.   Nazer said he would have liked to see the ceiling upped to 20million barrels a day in the last half of the year, but he notedthat ``several of the OPEC members were just afraid it may have animpact on price.''   The ministers said in a statement the ceiling could be raised to20 million barrels a day or more, effective Oct. 1, if demandremained strong.   ``I honestly feel that demand in the market is much stronger,''Nazer said.   Boussena agreed, saying that if prices hold steady, ``there is noreason not to add another 500,000 barrels a day'' to the cap.   OPEC retained in the new agreement its benchmark price of $18 abarrel. The average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored byOPEC was nearly $17.70 a barrel last week.   The new accord was designed to keep a firm grip on production sothat prices would remain robust. But oil markets reacted skepticallyto the cartel's ability to limit output. U.S. crude prices initiallytumbled but recovered somewhat on Thursday.   OPEC members are: Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emiratesand Venezuella.</TEXT></DOC>
