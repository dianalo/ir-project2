Although trading was cut short by the abbreviated holidayhours on Christmas Eve, crude oil futures rose in London andNew York on a call by Algeria for an emergency meeting of theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut outputto prevent a price crash.</LP><TEXT>   On London's International Petroleum Exchange, FebruaryBrent crude settled 18 cents higher at $17.83 a barrel. Onthe New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for Februarydelivery was up 19 cents to settle at $18.97 a barrel.   Both exchanges were closed for Christmas Day. But in U.S.oil fields, refiners were raising prices of crude oil by asmuch as 50 cents a barrel. This pushed up field postings forWest Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, to $17.75a barrel.   This week's rise in crude oil prices has come in the wakeof a slide since early November that trimmed oil prices $4 to$5 a barrel. Last Friday, the average of the basket of crudesOPEC uses as a reference was down from the $21 target to$17.15 a barrel.   The declines have alarmed several members of OPEC,including Algeria, Nigeria, Iran and Indonesia. GinandjarKartasasmita, Indonesia's oil minister, said last week thathis president had asked him to contact other OPEC members totake steps to prevent oil prices from falling further.   &quot;The key,&quot; Mr. Ginandjar said, &quot;is in the hand of SaudiArabia, which has increased production from 5.4 millionbarrels to 8.5 million barrels a day &quot; since the August 1990invasion of Kuwait by Iraq and the subsequent scrapping ofproduction quotas by OPEC. Currently, OPEC is producing morethan 24 million barrels a day, the highest level since thePersian Gulf crisis began.   A meeting of the oil ministers is scheduled Feb. 12 totake a new look at production levels. But Jibril Aminu,Nigeria's oil minister and also president of OPEC, alreadyhas queried other members about the possibility of holdingone earlier. Saudi Arabia is said to have rejected the idea.   On Tuesday, however, Nordine AitLaoussine, the Algerianoil minister, was quoted by the New York Times as saying thatOPEC &quot;should move immediately to cut its production by atleast 10%&quot; or face a price crash. The same day the Algerianpetroleum ministry sent a release to news agencies saying&quot;the majority&quot; of OPEC's members &quot;favor an extraordinarysession&quot; at this time.   Oil traders said that even though Algeria's position onOPEC's high rate of production already was widely known, itsseeking of an emergency meeting contributed somepsychological support to oil markets. Meanwhile, several oilanalysts share Mr. Ait-Laoussine's view. &quot;Unless OPEC actsquickly to stem the flow of crude oil, we expect prices tofall further this winter, quite possibly by as much as anadditional $4 a barrel,&quot; Marion B. Stewart, editor of theNational Economic Research Associates Energy Outlook,reported.   In other commodity markets Tuesday:                                                                                                          COPPER: Prices rallied in thin trading. The March contractsettled at 98.50 cents a pound, up 0.70 cents. WilliamO'Neill, senior futures analyst at Merrill Lynch Futures inNew York, said the full percentage-point cut in a keyinterest rate last Friday has encouraged bulls to hope thatindustrial production will be spurred by the move. However,he added, &quot;There is no real change in the demand picture tospeak of.&quot; He also noted that interest-rate increases inEurope aren't supporting copper prices. Fred Demler, metalsanalyst for PaineWebber, said the market was unusuallyvolatile, because the London market had only a morningsession in preparation for Christmas. With only New Yorkopen, the usual arbitrage between the two markets, whichchecks price volatility, wasn't present during the New Yorktrading session. He said that Monday's move above 97 centswas thought by some technically oriented traders to be abreakout and a response to an oversold condition. There wasalso some fund buying on Tuesday, according to Mr. Demler. Hesaid there was little news on the supply side, other than afew smelters around the world are having mechanical problems.Mr. O'Neill said he expects the demand for copper to bestronger in the second half of 1992 as the economy gainsstrength. He also noted that the copper market was encouragedon Tuesday by the durable-goods report that showed anincrease of 1.2%; many traders had expected a decline of 1.5%to 2%.                                                                                                          GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Grain traders pushed futures pricesslightly lower Tuesday by taking profits, after the U.S.durable-goods report spurred a rally in the value of thedollar. The exceptions were wheat prices, which got supportfrom anticipated bids for U.S. wheat by the former SovietUnion and Egypt. In addition, the grain import authorityExportkleb said it had paid $30 million in delinquent freightpayments, which should allow shipment of grain bound forRussia and other former Soviet republics to move smoothly outof U.S. ports. In light trading, the price of the wheatcontract for March delivery rose 2.25 cents Tuesday to settleat $4.0075 a bushel; the March corn contract fell 0.75 centsto $2.54 a bushel; and the March soybean contract declinedtwo cents to $5.66 a bushel.                                                                                                          COFFEE: Prices weakened on light volume as the marketcontinued the decline it has been in for some time. The Marchcontract opened near its high of 78.70 cents a pound but soldoff and settled at 77.50 cents. Once again some deliveriesmade new life-of-contract lows. Arthur Stevenson, tropicalcommodities analyst for Prudential Securities, said this moveis being spurred by poor buying of beans by roasters, whoseneeds appear to be well-covered. &quot;Supplies in this countryare plentiful, especially when compared with what they were afew years ago,&quot; noted Mr. Stevenson. He also pointed out thatthe market has become nervous over the possibility thatBrazil and Colombia, two major producers, may authorize forworld sale some of their government stockpiles of coffee. Inaddition, most Latin American producers have been exportingat a good pace, he noted. According to Mr. Stevenson, manytraders believed that as Eastern Europe and the former SovietUnion moved toward free markets, they would boost theirimports of such commodities as coffee and cocoa. &quot;That hasjust not happened. Instead they have decreased their imports,which, in turn, has put pressure on prices,&quot; said Mr.Stevenson. He added he wouldn't be surprised to see coffeeprices drop a few cents more, because nothing is in sightthat would halt the bear market.</TEXT></DOC>
