For the quarter ended April 30, net was $16 million, or 44 cents a share, down from $20.7 million, or 57 cents a share, including profit of $296,000 from discontinued operations. Revenue rose 6.7% to $241.8 million from $226.6 million.    &quot;The growth in box-office revenues wasn't sufficient to offset the higher operating costs associated with the net addition of 60 new screens,&quot; said Richard Smith, chairman. Profit was up in the company's other major business, soft-drink bottling, he said.    Profit also was hurt by interest and costs associated with investments in Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. and Cadbury Schweppes PLC, the company said.    For the six months, General Cinema reported net rose 17% to $31.9 million, or 87 cents a share, including an after-tax gain of $2.5 million from the sale of securities. In the year-earlier period, net was $38.4 million, or $1.05 a share, after profit from discontinued operations of $590,000. Revenue rose 3.5% to $482 million from $465.5 million. </TEXT></DOC>
