 The conference linked senior executives of Milpitas,Calif.-based Octel Communications Corp, from a hotel in San Jose, Calif., toend-users and the press in 23 cities accross North America.andM;Octel Canadian general manager Kim Fennell told an audience of 300 inToronto: &quot;This is a big step into a new era where voice, data and imagetechnologies are being tightly integrated and extended through the telephonenetwork to yield major new benefits for business.&quot;andM;According to Jacob Gordon, president of Don Mills, Ont,-basedtelecommunications consultancy Teleprime Ltd., the integration of the variousvoice processing elements is an industry trend.andP;  &quot;All the major voiceprocessing vendors are moving towards integrated platforms,&quot; he toldComputing Canada.andM;&quot;It's better for the client to have one (server) box than four,&quot; Gordon said.andM;He cautioned, however, that since voice processing systems are nowinteracting with databases a serious problem of distribution for the industryvendors has emerged.andP;  The question of who gets trained - computer value-addedresellers or telephone companies (the traditional voice system distributor) -is a serious issue, says Gordon.andM;The integrating capability of the Octel server has been dubbed a PowerCallsession by the company.andP;  The company says the PowerCall session pioneers theability to:andM;* deliver totally integrated multiple applications through a single point ofaccess;andM;* let callers freely and easily guide themselves during a call to databases,voice messaging, audiotex information, e-mail message notification, automatedfax delivery, or to a person's extension;andM;* intelligently carry caller data, such as an account number, through thecall, eliminating the need to re-enter information; and,andM;* scan callers' profiles in the database to present them with personalizedinformation and choices they can act on during the call.andM;For example, using a touchtone phone, a customer calling a bank could chooseautomated services that take his or her order for new cheques, verify acurrent savings balance, allow the transfer of funds between accounts, thenfax information on mortgages.andM;Changing habitsandM;Similarly, in a single PowerCall session, an employee calling in to a privatemailbox on the Voice Information Processing Server can retrieve informationfrom a connected database, review and send voice messages, hear notificationof electronic mail messages waiting, have information automatically faxed,and hear a summary of the hour's current industry news relevant to theemployee's business.andM;&quot;We think it (the PowerCall) will change the way people do business,&quot;enthused Michael West, executive vice-president at Octel Corp.andM;The new server is an evolution in the technology of the Octel Branch, BranchXP, Aspen, Maxum and Maxum Super-System voice processing systems and theSierra multiple applications platform.andM;Existing Octel voice processing systems can be upgraded to the server byadding new Unix-based hardware called the 500D Data Module, which was alsointroduced last month.andP;  Combined with the Data Module, existing Octel voiceprocessing systems function as the Voice Processing Module of the server.andO;(The server consists of the two modules working co-operatively.)andM;Octel also announced four new application packages for the Voice InformationProcessing Server and a system management tool.andM;The Octel CSA (Centralized Server Administration - available this month)system management tool allows multiple system managers to work simultaneouslyon one or several Octel systems; allows system managers to create and deletelarge blocks of mailboxes to be simple commands; and, permits blocks ofmailboxes to be delegated to an organization for private access andadministration.andM;Two-way notificationandM;The InterMail application provides users with two-way message notificationbetween Octel voice mail and the IBM PROFS (version available this month) andDEC All-In-1 (version available in November) e-mail systems.andM;The Octel FaxCall application (available now) allows callers to use thetouchtone keypad to have printed information automatically faxed to them.andM;Octel TransAct is an interactive voice response application (availableSeptember) that permits callers to interact with data in host computers bytelephone during a PowerCall session.andM;The TransAct DOS-base application generator allows multiple departments in acompany to create their own applications on IBM-compatible 286- and 386-basedPCs.andM;The Octel InfoTex application (available now) lets callers use a touchtonephone the hear the latest business, financial or general news, as well asweather, traffic and other commercially-provided information.andM;InfoTex can also automatically select and deliver specific news tosubscribers' voice mailboxes.andM;Application packages from Octel begin at $32,000 (U.S.) and are available inCanada through members of Telecom Canada.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
