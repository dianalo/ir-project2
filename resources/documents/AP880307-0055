(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Potential liability problemssurrounding a tree house that extends two feet over public propertyhave prompted city officials to give the structure the ax.   ``It's accessible to the public, and there is the possibility itcould entirely or partially fall on somebody passing by or damageproperty,'' said Chief Building Inspector Louis Kidwell.   The 8-by-6-foot tree house was built by Teresa Macdonald'sfather, a contractor, a few months ago as a Christmas present forher sons, James, 6, and Joey, 4.   It features wall-to-wall carpeting, a shingled roof and slidingplexiglass windows and is a popular place for neighborhood childrento play.   ``If I didn't have school, I'd spend every single day upthere,'' said James Macdonald.   ``My dad said, `Whatever happened to the days of HuckleberryFinn and Tom Sawyer?''' said Teresa Macdonald.   She said she understands the city's concern but added that fewpeople use the sidewalk on their dead-end street.   ``I've been up there on the windiest days and nothing hashappened,'' she said. ``We'd have to have an earthquake or anuclear war.''   The Macdonalds have until March 21 to remove the tree house. Ifthe city doesn't change its mind, they will build a foundation forit in their back yard and place it there.</TEXT></DOC>
