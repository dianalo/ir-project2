<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-55-1244 </DOCNO><TEXT>Based on theoretical and computational considerations, it is confirmedthat magnetic reconnection driven nonlinearly by a kink instability playsa key role in the magnetohydrodynamic relaxation. An important findingis that the relaxation takes the form of either global relaxation (e.g.,the reversed field pinch relaxation) or local relaxation (e.g., the tokamaksawtooth relaxation), depending on whether the driven reconnection istotal (antiparallel) or partial (partially antiparallel).</TEXT></DOC>
