Loan leverage is the ratio of total loansdivided by equity capital. Its acceleration over the pastgeneration has been dramatic.   In 1945 the American banking system had a loan leverageratio of 2.8. In other words, in 1945 American banks had only$2.80 in loans for each dollar of equity. By 1970, the loanleverage ratio was up to 7.4. We have run it up a lot furthersince: In 1988, the American banking system had almost $10 inloans for each dollar of equity.</LP><TEXT>   It should not surprise us that all-time high bank loanleverage (which means an all-time low capitalization of bankloan portfolios) has led to severe financial strain. If weadd to this that the loan portfolios themselves became moreaggressive and that bank activities in other risk dimensionsincreased, the banking system's current problems become evenless surprising.   Loan leverage is much more revealing of the extent ofbanking overexpansion than is the commonly usedassets-to-equity ratio. The total asset leverage of theAmerican banking system is about the same now as it was in1945, but loan leverage is 3 1/2 times as high and the systemis far riskier. Loan leverage is even higher if we look onlyat the biggest banks. At the end of 1990 the 10 largestAmerican banks had an average loan leverage ratio of 12.2.   Is heady loan leverage a sign of problems to come? As oneexample, consider the history of Continental Illinois Bank.Starting with a very conservative balance sheet, it more thandoubled loan leverage between the early 1950s and 1970. Thenit doubled loan leverage again in the next decade, reachingloans of 19 times equity in 1981. The crisis at Continentalbegan six months later.   Today average loan leverage is at historical highs;however, it varies widely among banks. Taking the 10 largestAmerican banks, loan leverage varies from Citicorp at 15.5and Chase Manhattan at 15.0 to J.P. Morgan's 5.0. Morgan,whose loan leverage is now considered highly conservative, isabout as leveraged as the average American bank was in 1955.   In October 1956 a vice president of New England Lifeobserved: &quot;The American people want to borrow beyond theavailability of bank capital.&quot; That is a perfect summary ofthe problem today.   ---   Mr. Pollock is a partner in a St. Louis, Mo., financialfirm.</TEXT></DOC>
