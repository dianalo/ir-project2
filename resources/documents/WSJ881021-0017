Long-term Treasury bonds were the star performers, advancing about 5/8 of a point, or $6.25 for each $1,000 face amount. That more than offset Wednesday's declines and left the benchmark 30-year government bond yielding 8.84%, down from 8.90%.    Municipal and mortgage-backed bonds posted smaller gains. But in the corporate market, RJR Nabisco Inc. debt issues fell sharply on news that management is considering a huge leveraged buy-out. Fears of additional leveraged buy-outs depressed many other industrial corporate bonds.    The Treasury bond rally came amid news reports of renewed quarrels between Iran and Iraq over oil production quotas. That led to speculation that oil prices will continue to fall. &quot;This market is very sensitive to oil. Every time oil moves, bonds react right away,&quot; said Hani Findakly, a managing director in the capital markets division at PaineWebber Inc.    Traders also were encouraged by a move by the Federal Reserve yesterday to inject reserves into the banking system. The maneuver &quot;gave people a little more confidence that the Fed hasn't engineered another tightening,&quot; said Mr. Findakly.    Earlier this week, there had been speculation that the Fed might be tightening credit slightly further in an effort to prop up the dollar. That conjecture stemmed from a rise in the closely watched interest rate on federal funds, or reserves that banks lend each other.    The higher funds rate this week appears to be a temporary aberration caused by technical factors, rather than by Fed policy change, several traders said. They expect the funds rate, which averaged about 8 3/8% yesterday, to drop back to the 8% to 8 1/4% range soon.    Treasury bonds and bond futures prices rallied after the Fed arranged repurchase agreements for its own account. The maneuver came shortly before noon EDT. At the time, the funds rate was 8 3/8%.    Traders also attributed part of yesterday's Treasury bond rally to news reports indicating that Congress won't pass legislation this week allowing the Treasury to issue a large volume of new 30-year bonds next month.    The bond issuance provision is part of a controversial tax bill. As of late yesterday, that bill appeared stalled, analysts said. If Congress doesn't act soon, the Treasury won't be able to issue new long-term bonds until early next year.    Treasury Securities   Long-term Treasury bonds posted the largest gains of the day.    The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bonds rose to 102 31/32 from 102 11/32 Wednesday, more than offsetting Wednesday's decline of about half a point.    The price of the latest 10-year Treasury notes rose to 102 31/32 from 102 26/32. The yield fell to 8.79% from 8.81%. The yield on the government's new seven-year notes declined to 8.67% from 8.70%.    An index of long-term Treasury bonds compiled by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. rose 3.64 points to 1259.01. It ranged between 1251.42 and 1261.27.    Short-term rates were little changed. The rate on new three-month bills finished unchanged at 7.43% bid, while the rate on new 26-week bills fell slightly to 7.57% bid from 7.58%.    The Treasury sold $9.02 billion of 52-week bills yesterday at an average annual return of 7.57%. Here are details:   Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.                                                  52-Week    Applications ..........................  $27,507,185,000    Accepted bids .........................   $9,017,615,000    Accepted at low price .................              81%    Accepted noncompetitively .............     $442,035,000    Average price (Rate) ..................   92.346 (7.57%)    High price (Rate) .....................   92.376 (7.54%)    Low price (Rate) ......................   92.346 (7.57%)    Coupon equivalent .....................            8.15%   The bills are dated Oct. 27 and mature Oct. 26, 1989.   Corporate Issues   Some investors began a flight to quality in the corporate bond market after leveraged buy-out worries knocked many industrial corporate bonds lower.   Dealers said some investors have begun purchasing both Yankee and utility company bonds in an attempt to shield themselves from &quot;event risk,&quot; that is, deteriorating credit quality brought on by mergers and acquisitions. A Yankee bond is a dollar-denominated security issued in the U.S. by a foreign institution.   Yankee bond issues tightened in spread by about three basis points, while utility company bonds tightened by about five basis points. That occurred in a session that should have seen spreads widen because Treasurys were generally outperforming corporates.   The corporate market was stung following the news that RJR Nabisco's management was considering a leveraged buy-out. RJR's intermediate debt securities, which had been trading Wednesday at between 60 and 80 basis points over Treasury issues, saw their spreads widen to roughly 200 basis points.   After the RJR news hit Wall Street, concern spread that many other industrial companies might be subject to leveraged buy-outs. Dealers said that led to no bids being placed for most industrial issues.   &quot;Even if this deal doesn't go through, the market's been spooked,&quot; one intermediate corporate bond dealer said.   Dealers said another result of the RJR situation could be investors demanding more so-called poison puts in new issues.   Poison puts generally allow investors to return their securities to the company if there has been a change of control. However, some poison puts are more restrictive than others. Dealers say some protect bondholders only from outside takeovers and not leveraged buyouts.   One new issue that came to market yesterday, Arkla Inc.'s $150 million of seven-year notes, did contain a poison put. Officials at lead underwritter Kidder Peabody andamp; Co. said the poison put was placed in the issue before the industrial market got pounded yesterday, and was similar to other poison puts the firm has done.   The Arkla notes were priced as a 9.45% issue at par. They came to market at 77 basis points over Treasuries.   Municipal Issues   Municipal bonds finished flat to slightly higher in moderately active trading.   &quot;It was all oil,&quot; a New York trader said. &quot;Oil gave it a better tone.&quot;   The New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% bonds of 2018 were quoted late in the day at 95 1/4 bid, up 1/4 point, to yield 7.59%.   The Intermountain Power Agency's new $500 million issue of power supply and revenue refunding bonds rose slightly. The IPA's 7 3/4% bonds due 2020 closed at a price of 99 3/4, up 1/4 from its issue price to yield 7.76%.   Mortgage-Backed Securities   Ginnie Maes and other mortgage issues generally finished 1/8 point higher in moderate trading.   Among major issues, Ginnie Mae's 9% issue for November delivery was quoted at 95 18/32, up 1/8; the 9 1/2% issue at 98 3/8, up 1/8, and the 10% issue at 101, also up 1/8.   Ginnie Mae's 10% issue was yielding 9.98% to a 12-year average life assumption, as the spread above the 10-year Treasury note widened one basis point to 120 basis points.   In derivative markets, Westam Mortgage Financial Corp. offered $400.3 million of Remic securities through Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. The issue, backed by Ginnie Mae's 9 1/2% issue, featured 10 classes.   Foreign Bonds   British government bond prices fell slightly as investors reacted with disappointment to U.K. money-supply figures for September.   In Tokyo, Japanese government bonds also edged lower. West German government issues were flat.   Prices of British government bonds, or gilts, dipped about 1/4 point. Dealers said a report released yesterday showed continued strong money-supply growth that added to inflation fears.   But dealers said the price decline was partly halted by further Bank of England purchases at the market's low for the day, and by indications from the latest weekly banking data that the money supply figures for October might improve.   In a London speech Thursday night, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson indicated that the Bank of England will continue buying gilts to offset the government's budget surplus. He said this means &quot;there will be no more gilt auctions for the foreseeable future.&quot;   Gareth Edwards, a dealer at Greenwell Montagu andamp; Co., said the bond market tried to rally in the afternoon but that there &quot;was no retail follow-through.&quot;   Britain's benchmark 11 3/4% issue due 2003/2007, which rose as high as 118 6/32, ended down 7/32 of a point at 117 23/32 to yield 9.45%.   In West Germany, government bond prices were flat after trading in a narrow range. The benchmark 6 3/4% issue of 1998 ended the day at 102.70 to yield 6.367%, unchanged from the previous day.   In Tokyo, Japanese government bonds finished slightly lower in light trading. &quot;After three days of (funds supplying) operations by the Bank of Japan, people realized they couldn't expect more soon, so they took some profits,&quot; a salesman at a Japanese brokerage firm said.   The central bank has been fairly aggressive recently in supplying funds and guiding interest rates lower as the yen regains its strength against the dollar.   Japan's benchmark No. 105, 5% bonds due 1997 closed at 101.82, down 0.16 yen per 100 yen face value. The yield rose to 4.715% in the interdealer market, up 2.5 basis points on the day. The range on the session was 4.705% to 4.735%. Volume was much lighter than the previous day.</TEXT></DOC>
