The action by the state Department of Environmental Conservationwas the first time it has exercised its authority to ground anentire fleet of barges since the department was created in 1970.   Commissioner Thomas C. Jorling said the companies andindividuals named in his order have a record so bad that, ``theircontinued operation presents an imminent danger to public healthand irreparable damage to the environment.''   One of the company's barges, operating illegally, sank Sept. 27at the First Marine Shipyard on Staten Island, spilling 50,000gallons of oil into a waterway known as the Kill Van Kull.   That was only the latest in a series of unrelated spills thathave dumped more than 1 million gallons of petroleum products intothe harbor during the past year.   The three companies named in the order are among the 45 or soowned by the family of former city Ports and Terminals CommissionerSusan Frank, as well as her mother, brother and sister.   They control at least 19 barges - about 10 percent of allcommercial barges operating in the harbor, Jorling said.   The companies are Berman Enterprises Inc. of New York City, andGeneral Marine Transport Corp. and Standard Marine Services Inc.,both of Bayonne, N.J.   Also named were 72-year-old Evelyn Berman Frank, who headsGeneral Marine; Peter Frank, president of General Marine; and JaneFrank Kresch, secretary of Berman Enterprises.   Telephoe messages left at their offices were not immediatelyreturned.   The barges are to remain docked at least until a hearing Oct.30, at which time the company will be allowed to present its case.After that, the environmental conservation department willdetermine whether to lift the shutdown order or allow the companiesto operate under restrictions.   The companies are also the subject of an ongoing criminalinvestigation, Jorling said.   In addition to the sinking of the Sarah Frank last month, thecompanies have been responsible since 1983 for nine known oilspills, three groundings, two collisions and 21 other cases inwhich the Coast Guard assessed penalties, Jorling's order said.   They have also been involved in fires and explosions that haveresulted in the deaths of two people and serious injuries toothers, it said.</TEXT></DOC>
