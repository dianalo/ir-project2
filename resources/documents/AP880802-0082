Byrd, D-W.Va., said Senate Democrats continue to work on a newaid package that will ``send a message to (Nicaraguan PresidentDaniel) Ortega that Congress supports the Arias peace plan,'' areference to the regional accord worked out by Costa RicanPresident Oscar Arias.   ``It is still my hope that we can develop a consensus that willsee Democrats unite'' on the aid package, Byrd said.   Byrd said the plan likely will include a provision to bringCongress back from its August recess should Ortega begin some newoffensive against the Contras.   ``We will not forsake the Contras if he (Ortega) elects toengage in some provocative act while Congress' back is turned,''Byrd said.   ``We're getting ready to go into a highly political period,''said Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., who was among a dozen senatorsscheduled to resume discussions today on the issue.   ``I think it's important to get an agreed-on policy everyone canlive by until we get a new president,'' Boren said.   The group was trying to find the magic combination ofhumanitarian and military aid and the timing and conditions for itsrelease that could muster broad support among Senate Democrats aswell as among Republicans, and defuse the issue as a politicalweapon.   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said he hoped anaid package could be assembled by midweek, when it likely would beattached to either a supplemental spending bill or a DefenseDepartment money bill.   He said he then would take the Democratic plan to SenateRepublican leader Bob Dole of Kansas and seek a bipartisanagreement. But he added: ``We're not quite there yet.''   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said a final aid plan ``might includethe opportunity for people to be able to have a vote (on militaryaid) under some circumstances, at some point in time.''   Kerry and other anti-Contra Democrats made clear, however, thatthey wanted a high threshold for triggering any new arms shipmentsto the rebels.   Dole has proposed his own Contra aid package, which would send$27 million in new humanitarian aid to the rebels after a currenthumanitarian aid program ends Sept. 30.   The Dole plan also would set aside $20 million for new weaponsfor the rebels, but would release that money only if Congressauthorized it in a separate vote.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the Reaganadministration is encouraged that Democrats are working on an aidproposal, and would cooperate ``to get an acceptable plan.''   The congressional dilemma over how to treat Nicaragua has beenexacerbated in recent weeks by growing tensions in the region.   The leftist Sandinista government has cracked down harshly oninternal opposition, arresting protesters and shutting downdissenting media outlets. At the same time, the Contras have grownmore intransigent, installing a new, more hard-line politicaldirectorate.   Democrats were searching for an aid formula that would keep theContras alive as an opposition force and strengthen their hand innegotiations with President Daniel Ortega's government, but wouldnot provoke renewed hostilities or be perceived as violating aregional peace accord.   Yet unanswered are questions of how much aid to provide, whetherit should include new weapons, who would have authority to orderresumption of any arms aid, what conditions would trigger the flowof weapons and how the aid would be delivered.   The Democrats also are seeking to defuse an issue that hasdivided their conservative wing from the party majority. The issuenow divides presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, who opposesContra aid, from his running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, whohas supported it consistently.   Although the Senate seemed likely to approve some sort of aidpackage, prospects for House passage of anything including amilitary component remained clouded.   Speaker Jim Wright said the House would wait to see whatsenators agree on before taking any action.   ``I still tend to doubt there will be votes in the House toresume the war,'' Wright said.</TEXT></DOC>
