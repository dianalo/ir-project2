Their belt-tightening moves signal that the companies believe the recent round of procurement reforms may have a more lasting effect than previous efforts and that competitiveness is more crucial than ever.    After seeing its profit margins on airplane engines cut nearly in half by competitive bidding, the Pratt andamp; Whitney unit of United Technologies Corp., for example, is reducing its supervisory staff 10%, shortening delivery time and greatly reducing scrapped parts and waste.    Boeing Co., meanwhile, slashed overhead costs 25%, helping it to win a string of six big contracts recently. Lockheed Corp., facing a slump in aircraft orders, is combining three separate operating subsidiaries into one, and General Dynamics Corp. hopes to chop a whopping 40% off its costs.    The slimming-down has come rather suddenly. Defense contractors -- notoriously successful at rebuffing reforms in the past -- initially resisted the changes forced on them by Congress and reform-minded military officials. But in the past year, competition, lower contract payments and other changes have squeezed military profits and depressed defense stock prices. With the post-1988 election defense budget projected to remain relatively flat, contractors see no alternative but to adjust.    &quot;We see a different Department of Defense business environment over the next 10 years, and we'd better adapt to it or fade away,&quot; says John Brizendine, president of Lockheed's aeronautical systems group and chief architect of the group's cutbacks.    Besides the Pentagon reforms, the defense industry's internal realignment is being nudged along by restructuring and merger-related changes that have affected American business in general. Allied-Signal Inc. and United Technologies, for instance, have reorganized their commercial operations and are trying to apply higher performance standards to their defense-related assets as well.    Martin Marietta Corp., one of the first U.S. companies to be forced into restructuring by a hostile takeover bid, has become a much-envied example of what can be done. Heavy with debt taken on to resist a 1982 Bendix Corp. overture, it realigned its aerospace business by targeting growth areas in the defense field, submitting fiercely competitive bids and tightly controlling costs. Indeed, Martin Marietta recently announced a new wave of cost-cutting that eliminated an entire level of corporate management.    Rockwell International Corp., too, is combining units and eliminating bureaucratic layers. Although difficult, such measures are viewed as necessary to sustain contractors through a period when the &quot;market&quot; -- the defense budget -- is expected to grow only about 3% a year.    At the same time, contractors face the difficult adjustment of being weaned from sole-source contracting, a comfortable system that covered nearly all costs and just about guaranteed a specified profit. Now they have to deal with the risky business of competition and fixed-price contracting.    Cost-sharing, or investing up front in research and development with the expectation of winning a production contract, has also hurt bottom lines. For the five contractors participating in the Air Force advanced tactical fighter, or ATF, competition, it will probably take 14 years to get back from the Pentagon the approximately $100 million that each plans to invest, company executives say. The funds will be returned through reimbursement of overhead costs.    Sanford N. McDonnell, chairman and chief executive of McDonnell Douglas Corp. predicts the ATF program will result in a financial loss overall. In 20 years, he says, the team that ultimately wins the ATF contract will make money, but not as much as the losing team will lose.    Other changes have added to the industry's burden. The government reduced monthly contract progress payments to 75% of contractors' estimated costs from 90%, gave itself 30 days instead of 15 days to make the payments and cut regulated profit on certain contracts by one percentage point.    &quot;Under the old way, you could make a profit four to six years after the (beginning) of a program,&quot; says Fred Wood, an executive vice president of General Dynamics. Now, he says, it can take twice that long.    Certain contractors figured out quicker than others how to win under the new rules. When the Air Force in 1984 announced that it was looking for a second supplier for the F-15 and F-16 fighters' engines -- which had been made only by Pratt andamp; Whitney -- General Electric Corp. snatched away the major share of the business three years in a row and also won overseas orders for 400 engines.    Pratt finally has begun to recover from what the Air Force calls &quot;engine wars,&quot; winning 55% of this year's U.S. engine orders. But GE has cut some staff from its engine divisions to remain competitive. &quot;You're looking now at a neck and neck race,&quot; a Pratt spokesman says.    Boeing, beaten badly in a few initial rounds of competition, has bounced back. Lockheed, on the other hand, is shrinking. Both companies are trying to change their reputations at the Pentagon as high-cost contractors, but they have different approaches to the future.    For Lockheed, one of the toughest lessons has been learning that it takes lower costs, not just technical superiority, to compete. After losing a battle with McDonnell Douglas to build the C-17 transport, Lockheed will be left with an eight-million-square foot plant in Marietta, Ga., that will be nearly empty in a few years. Another massive plant, in Palmdale, Calif., also will be nearly empty unless an updated version of Lockheed's P-3 can win a competition to build Navy reconaissance planes.    Meanwhile, the Navy says Lockheed's high costs may lead the government to find a second supplier of the Trident II nuclear missile, which accounts for about 12% of Lockheed's annual revenue.    The changes hurt. Lockheed has built nearly every military transport aircraft since the early 1960s. Versions of its P-3 have been in service for 25 years, and fleet ballistic missiles like the Trident have been under contract for 30 years.    &quot;You get to be king in your field, and it's tough to avoid complacency, to keep your competitive edge honed,&quot; says Mr. Brizendine.    Lockheed also lost two other competitions this summer and, despite the huge Reagan administration buildup of Navy craft, was beaten so badly in shipbuilding competitions that the company will close down its Seattle shipyard.    The recovery strategy for the one-time industry powerhouse is a humbling one. To raise capital, Lockheed is planning to shut down certain of its operations at its traditional home base at the Burbank, Calif., airport and to sell off valuable real estate holdings. Lockheed isn't saying how many of the 42,000 jobs in its aircraft group will be eliminated by combining three companies.    Because the market for defense prime contractors is shrinking, Mr. Brizendine says, the company hopes to earn about $1 billion a year from subcontracts and other business. Lockheed recently swallowed its pride and became a subcontractor to McDonnell Douglas, making the wings on the C-17 transport. In competition with Rockwell -- another contractor that soon may have a huge, empty plant in Palmdale -- Lockheed is also talking to Airbus Industrie about subcontract work for the European commercial jet consortium.    Boeing, too, has been chastened by procurement changes. Once a premier contractor, the company lost prestigious competitions in the past few years, forfeiting the Stealth bomber contract to Northrop and the MX missile and space shuttle external tank to Martin Marietta.    In fact, as the company's motivational film chronicles it, Boeing lost six out of seven large military contracts to Martin Marietta in the past few years. &quot;It's a matter of survival,&quot; the narrator says. &quot;We were not competitive.&quot;    Boeing turned from its defeats to an aggressive comeback. Designating certain contracts &quot;must win,&quot; it submitted very low bids and initiated its ambitious 25% cost-cutting program. Eyebrows are being raised throughout the industry about the bids, which some have labeled &quot;buying in&quot; or &quot;low-balling.&quot; In defense industry jargon, these refer to submitting unreasonably low bids to win a contract, and covering costs through inflated billing later, something Boeing strongly denies.    On two contracts to design launch and control systems for a small intercontinental nuclear missile, Boeing's bid undercut the company's traditional labor-cost formula by 40%. Its $300 million price on a third contract was $200 million less than the next lowest bidder. &quot;It is possible the company may recognize losses on some of its newer programs because of aggressive bidding,&quot; says Robert Kugel, an aerospace analyst with Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.    Boeing officials dispute this, saying their six, big new contracts are fixed-price and won't cover overruns. &quot;With a firm, fixed-price contract, buying in is just too dangerous nowadays,&quot; says Kenneth Russell, a Boeing executive.    Instead, the contractor has initiated a wholesale reorganization of its aerospace operations, designating small teams of engineers and production managers to work on the new projects and giving them an absolute ceiling on costs. &quot;We've trimmed down to our needs. What we want to hear from engineers is not the 'I wants' but the 'I needs,'&quot; says Gary Ammerman, a Boeing operations manager.    Such determined behavior has stimulated other companies to either slim down or lose business. &quot;They're all doing it,&quot; says David Smith, an aerospace industry analyst with Alex. Brown andamp; Sons in Baltimore. &quot;They have to.&quot;    ---        Earnings Outlook for Major Defense Contractors    Primary earnings per share for 1986 vs. 1987 estimates                                                     1987                                    1986           ESTIMATE    Boeing                         $4.28            $3.05    General Dynamics               -1.46             9.44    Grumman                         2.32             1.75    Lockheed                        6.18             6.45    Martin Marietta                 3.67             4.33    McDonnell Douglas               6.86             7.82    Northrop                        0.89             2.47    Raytheon                        5.10             6.02    Rockwell International*         2.06             2.50    United Technologies             0.27             4.43   *Year end Sept. 30   Source: Zacks Investment Research</TEXT></DOC>
