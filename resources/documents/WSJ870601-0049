Hal W. Brown Jr., chairman, said in a statement that Hollywood Park Realty and Hollywood Park Operating Co., whose shares are paired for trading, have received &quot;excellent offers&quot; from parties the companies didn't identify. The statement didn't estimate the price to be received, but said that sale of the property is expected to lead to retirement &quot;within one year&quot; of all debt related to Hollywood Park Realty's 1984 purchase of Los Alamitos Racetrack.    As previously reported, the independent auditors for the two companies, Arthur Andersen andamp; Co., issued a qualified opinion on their anual reports, citing their failure to meet requirements of a major loan agreement and noting that a sale of assets and possible refinancing of the loan are being considered.    Executives of Hollywood Park Realty couldn't be reached for comment.    Mr. Brown previously had said that the borrowings in question, from the Wells Fargo Bank unit of San Francisco-based Wells Fargo andamp; Co., totaled about $75 million. He said that his company had been hurt by cash flow problems because plans to develop land near the Los Alamitos track had been held up by zoning problems.    Hollywood Park Realty, a real estate investment trust, leases track facilities at Los Alamitos and Hollywood Park, located in Inglewood, to the operating company. </TEXT></DOC>
