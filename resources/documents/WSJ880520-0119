Icahn to liquidate at least a portion of his 14.8% stake in Texaco Inc. is starting to take shape.    Any agreement -- if one is even attained -- would permit Texaco to begin ridding itself not only of Mr. Icahn, its largest and most assertive shareholder, but risk arbitragers and other speculative investors as well. Mr. Icahn's presence has frustrated Texaco's negotiations with Saudi Arabia, which is considering setting up a joint venture involving certain of Texaco's U.S. refining and marketing operations.    Under serious consideration is a plan for Texaco to repurchase some of its shares in a so-called Dutch auction. That could enable Mr. Icahn to sell a significant portion of his stake at a tidy profit under terms offered to other holders and without depressing the value of Texaco shares. If Mr. Icahn were to sell his stake into the market, the share price would likely plunge in the process.    Also on the table are proposals to pay a special dividend and to distribute to shareholders so-called participation certificates in certain oil and gas properties. But a measure calling for the spinoff of shares of Texaco Canada Inc., a Toronto-based unit of the company, to shareholders is unlikely, according to people with knowledge of the talks.    Among options being seriously considered is an unusual variation of a stock repurchase program as well as a special dividend.    Meanwhile, Getty Petroleum Co. has voted its proxies in favor of Texaco's slate of nominees for board seats, industry sources say, removing for now yet another threat to the company's management. Getty filed for permission from the government earlier this year to purchase as much as 15% of Texaco and could have joined with Mr. Icahn or others to engineer a takeover of the oil giant. A Getty executive declined to comment.    By voting for Texaco, Getty voted down Mr. Icahn's slate for the five directorships that are up for grabs at the company's annual meeting in June. He recently replaced one of his nominees, Joseph E. Reid, former chief executive officer of Superior Oil Co., which was acquired by Mobil Corp., with Kurt Wulff, a well-known oil industry analyst.    For almost two weeks, representatives of Texaco have been discussing with Mr. Icahn an array of options that would distribute to shareholders part of the proceeds from planned asset sales. Texaco's negotiation team was expanded this week to include its investment banking firm, Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. Texaco expects to sell assets valued at $5 billion.    If an agreement between Mr. Icahn and Texaco can be hammered out, sources say it would likely include a so-called Dutch auction share repurchase plan. In such an arrangement, Texaco would agree to buy back a certain percentage of its own stock for a range of prices.    In a Dutch auction, the company would start buying back shares at the lowest price in the range and stop once it reached the predetermined limit. Shareholders most anxious to dispose of their Texaco stock would tender shares to the company at one of the lower prices, although they would ultimately all receive the highest price Texaco pays in the buy-back. Therefore, if he chooses to, Mr. Icahn might be able to rid himself of a sizable portion of his Texaco stake if he tenders his stock at the lower prices.    Although Texaco and Mr. Icahn have generally agreed on how much of the proceeds from the asset sales should be distributed to shareholders, the range of prices hasn't been locked in yet, sources say. It's also not yet clear whether several of the options under consideration, such as a buy-back and a dividend, will be put together as a package.    Because many of the Texaco assets on the selling block might not be sold for months, it's also uncertain when these programs could be put into place and a distribution to shareholders made. Texaco could negotiate a bridge loan so that a payout could be immediate, sources say. It could also issue certificates to shareholders entitling them to cash when the sales take place, or do nothing now and just hand out cash as the sales occur.    A bridge loan isn't particularly attractive, sources say, because it would limit the size of the restructuring. Debt covenants and a commitment by the company to maintain an investment-grade credit rating would make it difficult to negotiate a sizable loan. </TEXT></DOC>
