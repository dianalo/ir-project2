In describing the decision to investyet again in buildings plagued by crime and dilapidationbefore their abandonment, the Washington Post headlined,&quot;Chicago Is Not About to Give Up on a Bad Idea.&quot;   It is in fact striking testament to the power of the ideathat decent housing for the poor requires the involvement ofthe state that the emergence of public housing as a socialproblem -- rather than the panacea it was intended to be --has not changed much. There has been a rethinking of tactics-- Chicago, for instance, will attempt to mix the poor andthe less-poor in its renovated buildings -- but little doubtabout the essential need for a government role in housing thepoor. How did society come to such an assumption?</LP><TEXT>   Implicit is the widespread belief that the private markethad its turn at housing the poor long ago and failed ignobly.Such is our perception of what might be called thepre-history of housing -- the late 19th and early 20thcenturies, the time of the meteoric growth of Eastern andMidwestern cities. We view this period as one synonymous withhousing evils largely thanks to the era's extraordinarilywell-organized housing reform movement.   This movement began with Jacob Riis's descriptions oftenement conditions on New York's Lower East Side; tookconcrete form in the work of Lawrence Veiller, the premieradvocate from 1900 to 1920 of more demanding housingconstruction codes; and might be said to have culminated withthe work of Catherine Bauer, who called in 1934 forgovernment-built &quot;modern housing&quot; to replace &quot;nasty,inconvenient, crowded houses {in} ugly, formless cities.&quot;   Yet there is reason to believe that these bad old days --when there was little in the way of zoning and no publiclysubsidized housing construction -- may not have been thatbad; that neighborhoods branded as slums may well have beenbetter in important ways than their subsidized successors.Indeed, there are grounds to see this era as a time when theprivate sector produced not only a relatively large amount of&quot;affordable&quot; housing, but did so in forms that encouraged asocial cohesion painfully lacking in government-builtsubstitutes.   Major investigations of housing conditions of the urbanpoor were undertaken, at congressional behest, in 1893 andjust after the turn of the century. &quot;Slums of Cities&quot; wasissued by the Commissioner of Labor Statistics in 1894;&quot;Immigrants in Cities,&quot; by the U.S. Immigration Commission in1907. Both reports do bear out some of the conditions weassociate with housing of the time. The 1894 report found,for instance, that the overwhelming majority of residents of&quot;representative slum districts&quot; of Baltimore and Philadelphiahad neither their own bathrooms or flush toilets. In&quot;congested and poor districts&quot; examined by the ImmigrationCommission, there were an average of 134 people for each 100rooms. Yet these reports do not, for the most part, paint ableak picture of life in poor neighborhoods --   and do not find fault with the housing per se.   &quot;Eighty four in every 100 of the homes studied are kept ineither good or fair condition,&quot; wrote the ImmigrationCommission. &quot;The neglected appearance of a great many of thestreets is a result of indifference on the part of the cityauthorities.&quot; Outside of New York there were few largetenements. In the Chicago neighborhood surrounding reformerJane Addams's Hull House in 1893, 83% of families lived instructures of six units or less; 54%, in structures -- mainlywood-frame &quot;cottages&quot; -- of four units or less.   Rents, at least by today's standards, do not appear tohave been high. The 1894 report found that the average slumwage earner in the four cities surveyed (Baltimore, Chicago,Philadelphia and New York) was earning $8.84 a week. Thelargest group of families paid between $1 and $2 a week inrent. Similarly, a 1909 one-city study by the President'sHomes Commission of 1,251 poor families in Washington foundthat, even among the very poorest, rents averaged only 21% ofincome, less than what is charged in public housing today.(The majority of the families surveyed paid 17.5% or less.)   Perhaps most noteworthy, however, is the large extent towhich slum-dwellers either owned their own homes or lived inhomes that were owner-occupied. The 1894 report found that36% of all families in the Hull House neighborhood lived inbuildings that they either owned or in which the owner lived.In Baltimore, where row homes ruled, the figure was 30%.These figures do not include the large number of singlepeople who were lodgers in other people's homes. The 1907Immigration Commission report found that 30% of slum familiestook in boarders or lodgers. (There is no mention, by theway, of a problem akin to homelessness.)   One can infer from these figures a core population,perhaps even a majority in poor neighborhoods, living instructures they either owned outright or in which they paidrent to someone else who lived there. There would seem to beclear implications for both the upkeep of properties and theconduct of residents.   By 1930, census data for 23 poor Chicago neighborhoodsshowed that the percentage of homes owned by their occupantsin such areas had doubled from 1894. This was a trend fueledby the types of houses builders were putting up: small, builtclosely together, often with one or more rental units whoseincome could support the mortgage payment. By 1940, Chicagohad more than twice as many housing units in two-, three- andfour-family houses (382,028) as it had single-family homes(164,920).   In other cities, &quot;affordable&quot; housing was taking differentforms: Between 1870 and 1940, some 299,000 attachedsingle-family row houses were built in Philadelphia; inBoston, 21,000 &quot;three-decker&quot; houses (three units builtvertically) went up.   The housing reform movement viewed these developments farfrom positively. Catherine Bauer, in her landmark book&quot;Modern Housing,&quot; dismissed the wave of new housingconstruction as nothing more than &quot;circles of incipientblight.&quot; University of Chicago sociologist Edith Abbott,writing in 1936, drew special attention to what she viewed asthe problem of the &quot;tenement landlord.&quot; Abbott worried abouttraits not necessarily to be discouraged. Home-owningfamilies, wrote Abbott, took the least desirable units forthemselves and rented out the better units. Resident owners,she went on, saw themselves as joining a &quot;superior socialgroup.&quot;   Reformers typically focused on physical standards ofhousing -- assuming the conditions were inevitably permanent-- and the sacrifices involved in living in ways they wouldnot care to live themselves. They ignored the possibilitythat the housing they disparaged had other values -- inholding neighborhoods together, in helping their ownersadvance economically.   Reformers were certain that housing built by governmentwould mean nothing but improvement. Catherine Bauer called in1934 for &quot;an entirely new method of providing an entirely newstandard of urban environment&quot; -- apartments grouped aroundlarge interior plazas. Only three years later, the firstnational legislation, the Housing Act of 1937, was passed.   As housing projects like those Bauer envisioned went up,two- and three-family houses in American cities decayed; 21%of such housing was lost between 1960 and 1970. Zoning madeit difficult or impossible to build new multi-family housingboth in the cities and in expanding suburbs. The onlyimportant counter-trend to this quashing of market-providedhousing for the poor was the emergence of the mobile home,primarily in the Sun Belt.   The problems of public housing and the complications ofsubsidized construction are cause to wonder whether we wereright to turn our back on what the private market actuallydid to house the poor.   ---   Mr. Husock is director of case studies at Harvard'sKennedy School of Government.</TEXT></DOC>
