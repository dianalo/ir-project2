Oil prices on spot and futures markets stagnated in thin trading during much of January after soaring in the weeks just after the oil cartel's December agreement to cut production. On Friday, oil futures for March delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange edged up nine cents to $18.75 a barrel.    But with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' accord on production cuts and fixed prices taking effect yesterday, oil traders will focus on how closely OPEC members adhere to the pact, analysts say. OPEC agreed to cut production 7% in the first half of this year and to adopt, beginning yesterday, a price of $18 a barrel for a group of crude oils used as a benchmark.    &quot;This is a major testing time for OPEC,&quot; says Ian Gibson, a vice president at Kleinwort Grieveson Securities, a New York-based unit of Kleinwort, Benson Inc. Nauman Barakat, an oil analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., New York, says the next two weeks will be &quot;crucial for the direction of the market.&quot;    Most traders agree that OPEC has stayed close to the terms of the accord so far, in advance of its official implementation. Although this may have been aided by the normal winter bulge in demand in the oil market, the cartel also has won pledges of cooperation from major non-OPEC producers, as Norway, Mexico and the Soviet Union among others have indicated willingness to cut oil output. Many analysts say that if the OPEC agreement holds, prices will remain steady and could rise above $20 a barrel in the next several weeks.    But hurdles remain, many say. For one thing, excess inventories persist. What's more, cheating on quotas probably will continue, and fixed prices will be resisted by major oil companies, according to a recent report by PaineWebber Inc., New York. And some analysts say OPEC's new price structure is too rigid and fragile.    Traders &quot;will be watching to see how OPEC handles the issue of crude differentials, which will probably have to be adjusted fairly regularly in order to reflect market trends,&quot; says Mehdi Varzi, a former Iranian diplomat and currently Kleinwort Benson's senior energy analyst.    More important, traders say, will be the cartel's actions when seasonal demand starts to slacken toward the end of the first quarter. If there is evidence of significant cheating on quotas or prices by OPEC members, analysts say, oil prices will plunge -- some say to as low as $12 a barrel.    &quot;In this game there are 13 dealers (the OPEC members), and a misdeal by any one of them could very well bust their hand,&quot; a recent report by the Barrel, a London-based oil newsletter, said.    The joker in the deck, in this analogy, is the Persian Gulf war. Oil traders have long tended to ignore the claims of both Iran and Iraq in their six-year-old conflict. &quot;Traders are jaded&quot; toward war reports, Paul Mlotok, oil analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc., New York, says.    But with Iranian forces edging closer to Basra, Iraq's second largest city, the chances of an Iranian victory may have increased. And an Iranian success probably would result in a sudden jump in oil prices and move OPEC toward a higher-price strategy, several analysts say. Kleinwort Benson's Mr. Varzi says prices in that event could soar above $25 a barrel.    But the more immediate focus will be on the cartel's pricing mechanism, many analysts say.    &quot;Until we see some movement by oil companies . . . to pick up barrels at OPEC's official price level, the oil market will continue to be stagnant,&quot; Richard Redoglia, an oil broker for Merrill Lynch Futures Inc., New York, says.    The recent calm in crude oil prices at the New York Mercantile Exchange, however, hasn't dimmed the success of the exchange's crude oil options contracts. Launched in November, the options have had average volume of about 4,425 contracts a day.    Traders say that figure will rise further when refiners, many of whom have been using option pilot programs, decide to participate more actively.    &quot;They've only been testing the waters so far, putting their toes in,&quot; Andrew Lebow, oil analyst for Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., New York, says. </TEXT></DOC>
