MCI has grabbed about 12 percent of the long-distance market andUS Sprint 8 percent as American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.'s sharehas steadily eroded to about 68 percent. A variety of smallercompanies split the rest.   MCI said its net income grew 142 percent on a 31 percent gain inrevenue that was helped by the availability of new services.   MCI said it was competing more effectively in the $4 billionoperator services market because of expanded services since April 1that enable customers to make collect, third-party-billed, andperson-to-person calls.   MCI also began competing April 1 for long-distance customers ofpay phones, once a monopoly of No. 1 American Telephone andamp; TelegraphCo. During the quarter it won its largest contract to date, a $150million award from Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. for voice and datatransmission.   Washington-based MCI said it earned $150 million, or 56 cents ashare, compared to $62 million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier.Revenue rose to $1.59 billion from $1.22 billion.   For the first half, MCI earned $285 million, or $1.07 a share, upfrom $120 million, or 42 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue roseto $3.09 billion from $2.35 billion.   Daniel F. Akerson, MCI's chief financial officer, said thecompany's $6 billion investment in its network has started to payoff. The company has posted eight consecutive quarters of recordprofit and revenue, he said.   United Telecommunications Inc., the Kansas City, Mo.-basedmajority owner of US Sprint, said the long-distance unit contributed$48.1 million in operating income in the quarter as it posted itsfirst billion-dollar quarter, with $1.04 billion in revenue.   A year earlier US Sprint, the No. 3 long-distance company, had anoperating loss of $98.3 million on revenue of $799 million.   The turnaround at US Sprint led to a 121 percent profit increasefor the parent company, which also provides local phone service in19 states, mostly in the Southeast and Midwest.   United Telecom said its earnings rose to $90.5 million, or 86cents a share, from $41 million, or 40 cents a share, a yearearlier. Companywide revenue rose to $1.85 billion from $1.56billion.   For the first six months, net income rose to $166.9 million, or$1.59 a share, from $75.4 million, or 73 cents a share, a yearearlier. Revenue rose to $3.62 billion from $3.05 billion.   In coming months US Sprint should benefit from its part-ownershipof a trans-Atlantic fiber-optic cable and from its participation ina federal government phone contract, it said. The contract will makethe U.S. government into the company's biggest customer.</TEXT></DOC>
