ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Those questions about George Bush's role inthe Iran-Contra affair just won't go away. They dogged him duringthe presidential campaign and they hit him again Friday. But Bushis standing fast, refusing to offer any new details.   ``Please, accept it when I said I don't want to talk about itany more,'' said the president when reporters raised the issue anewduring a briefing on the Alaska oil spill.   ``Look, we're having a briefing on Alaska,'' he said, sounding abit testy over the attempt to get him to talk about anextraordinary document entered into evidence at the trial of OliverNorth.   The document outlined the workings of the secret effort to keepsupplies flowing to the Nicaraguan Contras despite a congressionalban on aid. It began with the statement that ``the United Stateshas admitted for purposes of this trial the following facts to betrue.''   The account suggested that Bush, then vice president, had a moreactive role in that supply effort than has been publicly disclosed.   It said Bush met with the president of Honduras in May 1985 toinform him of President Reagan's decision to speed up delivery ofU.S. military aid to that country. Former National Security AdviserRobert McFarlane has testified that Reagan personally approved thesecret deal to slip extra aid to Honduras as one of several ``quidpro quo'' arrangements with other countries in exchange for supportfor the Contras.   The document linked the U.S. aid to Honduran cooperation inassisting the Contras, but it did not say whether Bush was aware ofthat condition.   Exactly what Bush was aware of in those conspiratorial days inthe White House basement has never been clear.   Bush has denied having any knowledge of a diversion of Iranarms-sales proceeds to the Contras, although he admitted knowingabout the clandestine arms sales to Iran and said he supported theinitiative with certain reservations. Donald Gregg, his nationalsecurity adviser during the period in question, said he did nottell Bush about the Contra resupply effort that Gregg had learnedabout from a one-time CIA associate.   Former Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. pressed Bushrepeatedly during the campaign for the 1988 GOP presidentialnomination to say more about his role in the effort to help theContras.   ``If you can't answer your friends,'' said Haig, during aRepublican candidate debate ``what in heaven's name is going tohappen next November if you are our standard-bearer and theseDemocrats get after you on this subject?''   Candidate Bush liked to cite his experience as Reagan's No. 2.   ``I've been co-pilot for seven years,'' he said.   ``Were you in the cockpit or were you on an economy ride in theback of the plane?'' retorted Haig.   Republican rival Bob Dole was equally determined but no moresuccessful.   Would he release some of the documents pertaining to his role,Bush was asked by his Republican rivals.   ``I think some of those are classified,'' he said.   Asked whether he would allow them to be declassified, the vicepresident replied, ``I'm perfectly willing.''   On one point Bush was absolutely correct. He said no Republicanwould beat him by making an issue of Iran-Contra.   No Democrat would either, hard as they would try.   ``Where was George?'' Democrats chanted at their convention whenSen. Edward M. Kennedy used that refrain to question what role Bushhad in Iran-Contra as well as other policy issues during his termas vice president.   Safely elected and inaugurated and now happily in residence at1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Bush still can't seem to kick thoseIran-Contra questions.   No longer No. 2, he appeared in the White House briefing room totalk about the Alaskan oil spill.   He outlined steps he was taking to assist the cleanup and theninvited questions.   ``Fire away,'' he said.   ``How do you reconcile your efforts to arrange third-countrymilitary aid for the Contras with the spirit of the ban by Congresson aid to the rebels?'' was the first question.   ``I'm not going to comment on any aspect of the North trial,''responded the president in measured tones.   He expressed concern about prejudicing the trial of the formerWhite House aide and said the information had already been examinedby the special prosecutor and congressional committees thatinvestigated the case.   ``All the material that you seem to be referring to ... has beenavailable to the independent counsel and the Iran-Contra committeeand has been reviewed by them for any special significance.''   But it remains largely unavailable to the public and was neveravailable either to Bush's campaign rivals or to the voters in 1988.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Donald M.
