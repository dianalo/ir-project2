Just how long the strikes will last is unclear. Negotiators for Pacific Telesis's telephone units in California and Nevada met yesterday with the Communications Workers of America, which represents about 42,000 employees in the two states. Meanwhile, spokesmen for the CWA and for Nynex indicated that the union and the company were far apart on a number of important issues. In bargaining three years ago, the CWA struck Nynex for nine days. At Bell Atlantic, a union spokesman speculated that negotiations, which broke off just before 7 a.m. EDT yesterday, might resume soon.    The old contracts expired at 12:01 a.m. EDT yesterday. The strikes had little effect as managers scrambled to fill in for striking operators, installers and repair workers. But with business in full swing today, gaps in operator assistance and repairs are expected to grow. Overall, however, computer-driven telecommunications networks blunt the effect of strikes; customers aren't expected to encounter many problems in placing or receiving calls.    At Nynex, whose territory includes most of New England and New York State, about 40,000 CWA members and 20,000 members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers struck. The two sides had not even been meeting face-to-face in the days before the expiration of the contract, and the union didn't acknowledge a package that New York-based Nynex put on the table Friday afternoon before it struck.    Both sides indicated they wouldn't budge on the crucial issue of health care. The company, under pressure to control expenses, has sought to shift some medical costs to employees.    Health-care cost shifting was among the top issues for some 41,000 CWA members who walked off their jobs at Bell Atlantic's phone companies in Delaware, Washington, D.C., Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia. Bell Atlantic, based in Philadelphia, prepared for a strike today by 9,000 employees in New Jersey represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Meanwhile, the company continued negotiating with IBEW representatives of 2,000 employees in Pennsylvania. Employees in both states, however, weren't crossing CWA picket lines yesterday, according to the company.    In California, the IBEW extended for a week its contract covering about 1,600 employees at Pacific Telesis's Pacific Bell Directory unit.    Meanwhile, BellSouth Corp. and CWA negotiators representing some 64,000 employees at the Atlanta-based company's two telephone units reached a tentative agreement late Saturday night. CWA spokesman Tim Ryles in Atlanta said the new three-year agreement retained a cost-of-living adjustment, boosted wages moderately and added some family benefits without tinkering with the existing health-care package. Three years ago, the union agreed to significant steps to rein in skyrocketing costs for medical care. &quot;As for health care, our position going into negotiations was: Don't even think about it,&quot; Mr. Ryles said.    CWA contracts expire next Saturday with the three other regional telephone companies created by the Bell System breakup: Southwestern Bell Corp., St. Louis; U S West Inc., Denver; and Ameritech, Chicago. Ameritech's Illinois Bell unit has already settled with the IBEW, its major union.    The strikes are in sharp contrast to the agreement between American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and the CWA and IBEW last May. That agreement won wide praise for its family-care provisions such as dependent-care reimbursement accounts; flexible work hours; leaves of absence to care for infants or ill family members; and a fund to improve child-care and elder-care services.    In unusual moves that underscored the contentiousness of the talks, Nynex publicly disclosed details of the negotiations and Bell Atlantic called a news conference on the strike. In more traditional fashion, San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis's telephone companies issued a brief statement expressing the hope that the strike would be settled soon.    Nynex acknowledged that it wants to get a better handle on health-care costs and that it has proposed alternative arrangements, but its annual contribution would rise 49% to $3,520 per employee in the next three years. Among other things, Nynex also said it proposed an immediate 5% wage increase, including a payout of as much as $1,000; a 2% increase and a cost-of-living adjustment in both the second and third years; a 14% increase in pensions for those retiring after Jan. 1, 1990; a 20% increase for those who retire before then; and a bonus program tied to the performance of each subsidiary.    In a three-page news release, the company also gave details of dental-plan improvements; new education loans; family-care leaves of absence for as much as two years; reimbursements for adoption expenses; and an eye-care program for workers who use video display terminals.    Bell Atlantic was a little more guarded. Ed Grogan, vice president of human resources, said the strike caught Bell Atlantic by surprise. The company, he said, was working with the union on a final offer when the strike was announced. The company also disclosed details of its offer, including wage increases with a $300 bonus upon ratification of the contract, profit-sharing and medical cost-sharing plans.    Separately, the labor unrest may be spawning the sabotage of telephone equipment. Bell Atlantic said two fiber-optic cables at a New Jersey Bell central office in Caldwell, N.J., were severed last Monday, causing a disruption of local and long-distance service for thousands of businesses and residents that lasted more than nine hours. Since that incident, the company said it has had 70 instances of vandalism to plant equipment and phone lines.    Peter Ventimiglia, a New Jersey Bell spokesman, said it was &quot;clear the acts of vandalism accelerated&quot; as the contract expiration drew near. IBEW President Joe McLaughlin denied that there was any connection between the union and the vandalism. &quot;The companies are using this as a propaganda lever,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
