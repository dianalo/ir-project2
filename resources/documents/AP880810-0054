(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal judge accused by a highercourt of being ``hardened against the government'' in favor of theKu Klux Klan has set a hearing to determine his own fitness fortrial in U.S. government cases.   No one from the Justice Department plans to be at the hearingscheduled for Friday by U.S. District Judge William M. Acker Jr.But an attorney for Klansmen said he'll be there to state thatAcker has been ``good and fair.''   Acker, a 60-year-old Yale Law School graduate appointed to thebench by President Reagan in 1982, delivered rulings against theJustice Department in litigation involving the Klan that promptedthe 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to remove him from the case.   ``During the course of this litigation,'' wrote Circuit JudgeFrank M. Johnson of Montgomery, ``Judge Acker's position has becomehardened against the government, and he has evidenced a commitmentthat clearly reflects that he is no longer able to view these casesimpartially.''   Acker had ruled that the actions of several Klansmen accused ofviolating the rights of marchers in a violent confrontation atDecatur in 1979 did not justify what Acker said were impropertactics used by the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery,which Acker branded ``a counter-vigilante group.''   The center had sued the Klansmen, then gave their testimony inthat case to the Justice Department, which used it to obtainindictments against the Klansmen. Acker ruled the testimonyinadmissible and then did not follow 11th Circuit instructions toadmit it.   The government appealed and the 11th Circuit ruled that theKlansmen's testimony should not be suppressed.   The appeals court ordered Acker's removal from the case in Junewhen the government filed a second appeal, arguing he had failed tofollow the directions.   Afterward, Acker scheduled the hearing on his own fitness,saying:   ``This court is neither seeking praise nor condemnation ... butfeels it is necessary that it create a forum for frank and seriousdiscussion of a very serious subject, namely: `Should a judge whoseposition is hardened against the government sit on the government'scases?'''   The U.S. attorney for northern Alabama, Frank Donaldson, saidTuesday that no one from the Justice Department will be at thehearing.   ``The United States has at this time insufficient information todetermine and no reason to believe that Judge Acker's proposedgeneral recusal is either necessary or appropriate,'' Donaldsonsaid in a legal response to the hearing.   Donaldson said a decision to recuse Acker, or legally challengehis competence to preside as judge, ``is better left forconsideration on a case-by-case basis.''   Kenneth J. Gomany, one of the attorneys for the Klansmen, saidhe plans to attend the show-cause proceeding ``to submit any kindof briefs in support'' of the Acker.   ``I think he is a good and fair judge and he's ruled against ourclients and against the government on occasion. More often thannot, he's ruled against our clients. All in all, he's beenimpartial,'' said Gomany.   Morris Dees, director of the poverty center, said hisorganization would take no position on Acker's qualifications topreside over government cases.   ``We've never had any experience with Judge Acker in any othercase,'' Dees said. During nearly two decades, the center hashandled several highly publicized civil rights and death penaltycases.</TEXT></DOC>
