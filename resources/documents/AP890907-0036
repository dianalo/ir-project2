The revised multi-family housing co-insurance program willinclude tighter eligibility requirements for lenders and an expandedmonitoring effort by HUD, the officials, who spoke on condition theynot be identified, said Wednesday.   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp suspended the program four months ago,ordering a review of its management. Kemp was to announce plans torenew the program Wednesday but delayed it because of unresolvedissues dealing with new regulations, one of the officials said.   The officials said staff members would be added to monitor thelenders and the program would be upgraded from a branch of thedepartment's housing division to a separate office under theassistant secretary for housing.   The program was a major part of the Reagan administration'seffort to turn government tasks over to the private sector.   Under the program, HUD insures up to about 80 percent ofmortgages for multi-family housing projects against default.Defaults in the program total more than $700 million, withWashington-based DRG Funding accounting for $583 million of thetotal.   HUD's inspector general, in a critical review of the program,said lenders appeared to be overvaluing property to issue inflatedmortgages. That would bring them higher fees because they receive apercentage of the loan amount.   Kemp suspended the program three months ago, one of a number ofHUD programs halted or put on hold amid reports of widespreadmismanagement, fraud and influence-peddling at the agency under theReagan administration.   Since Kemp took over the agency in February nine companies havebeen suspended from the program or placed on probation.</TEXT></DOC>
