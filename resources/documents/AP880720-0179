The threat to move the refugees to the communist guerrilla-runcamps was announced by Suvit Suthanukul, the secretary-general ofthe National Security Council. The refugees are now housed at theKhao-I-Dang camp in Thailand.   ``Resettlement countries have known all along that Thailandcannot bear the refugee burden indefinitely, and we regard the Aug.31 dateline as an acceptable time frame under which all mustquickly try to resettle the (Cambodians),'' he said.   The Khao-I-Dang camp, about eight miles from the Cambodianborder, now shelters about 17,000 people who fled the war inCambodia. It is the only Thai camp from which the Cambodians can beresettled.   Suvit said that starting Sept. 1, authorities will move anyCambodians who have not been resettled to the Site 2 camp, next tothe Cambodian border. Suvit said the movement would be completed bythe end of the year.   Site 2, which houses 169,000 people, is the largest civiliancamp run by the Cambodian Marxist guerrillas.   ``(The camp is) not far from the border and is still unsafe fromborder shellings,'' Suvit said.   Western officials have opposed moving the refugees out ofKhao-I-Dang, the only refugee camp for Cambodians not run by theKhmer Rouge guerrillas. They say the new camp is too close tofighting between the Cambodian rebels and Vietnamese troopsoccupying their country.   A Foreign Ministry official, Kobsak Chutikul, said that 4,000Cambodians at Khao-I-Dang are likely to receive asylum by the Aug.31 deadline. But many of the others have been rejected severaltimes by resettlement countries, he said.   The United States has accepted the largest number of Cambodianrefugees.   Kobsak said the United Nations is working on a program to findother solutions for the Khao-I-Dang refugees whom Western countriesare unwilling to resettle.   ``Their future is their return to their homeland. It's time topuruse efforts in that direction,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
