The temporary regulations provide guidance under sections382 and 383 relating to the manner and method of absorbing the section382 limitation with respect to certain capital losses and excess creditsafter there has been an ownership change of a corporation within the meaningof section 382. Sections 382 and 383 were amended by section 621 of the1986 Act (Pub. L. No. 99-514; 100 Stat. 2085). Section 382 was furtheramended by section 10225 of the 1987 Act (Pub. L. No. 100-203; 101 Stat.1330-413) and by sections 1006, 4012 and 5077 of the 1988 Act (Pub. L.No. 100-647). The temporary regulations also contain amendments to thetemporary regulations under section 382. Sections 1.382-1T and 1.382-2Twere added to CFR by T.D. 8149, published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on August 11, 1987 (52 FR 29668).<ITAG tagnum="84">Explanation of Provisions</ITAG>(a) Overview of Section 382Under section 382, as amended, if an ownership change occurs with respectto a ``loss corporation'' (as defined in section 382 and the regulationsthereunder), the amount of the loss corporation's taxable income for apost-change taxable year that may be offset by the net operating lossesof the loss corporation arising before the ownership change is limitedby an amount known as the ``section 382 limitation.'' The section 382 limitationalso applies to limit the use of certain built-in losses (whether capitalor ordinary in character) recognized by the loss corporation after an ownershipchange.The section 382 limitation for a taxable year of a loss corporation afteran ownership change (a ``new loss corporation'') is generally equal tothe fair market value of its stock immediately before the ownership changemultiplied by a rate of return published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin(the ``long-term tax exempt rate''). See generally sections 382 (b), (e),and (f). This limitation for a taxable year may be increased by certainitems, such as an unused limitation for a prior taxable year or certainbuilt-in gains recognized during the taxable year. See, for example, sections382 (b)(2) and (h).In general, an ownership change involves an increase of more than 50 percentagepoints in stock ownership by 5-percent shareholders during the testingperiod (usually the three year period ending on the date on which a transactionis tested for an ownership change). See generally section 382(g) (relatingto ownership change), section 382(i) (relating to testing period), andandSection;1.382-2T (temporary regulations relating to ownership changes).(b) Amendments to andSection; 1.382-2T The definition of ``loss corporation'' set forth in andSection; 1.382-2T(f)(1)is amended to include a corporation which (1) is entitled to use a capitalloss carryover, excess foreign taxes carried over under section 904(c),a carryforward of a general business credit under section 39, or a prioryear's unused minimum tax credit under section 53; or (2) for a taxableyear in which certain sales or other transactions relating to its stock(or options to acquire its stock) occur has a net capital loss, excessforeign taxes under section 904(c), unused general business credits undersection 38, or an unused minimum tax credit under section 53. The definitionof ``pre-change loss'' in andSection; 1.382-2T(f)(22) is expanded to include``pre-change capital losses'' (as defined in andSection;andSection; 1.383-1T(c)(2)(i) and (ii)) and ``pre-change credits'' (as defined in andSection; 1.383-1T(c)(3)).The reporting and recordkeeping requirements set forth in andSection;andSection;1.382-2T(a)(2) (ii) and (iii) are applicable with respect to any corporationthat is a ``loss corporation'' under the amended definition of that term.Thus, for example, loss corporations entitled to use a capital loss carryover,a carryover of excess foreign taxes under section 904(c), a carryforwardof a general business credit under section 39, or with an unused minimumtax credit under section 53 are subject to the reporting and recordkeepingrequirements of andSection;andSection; 1.382-2T(a)(2) (ii) and (iii). A specialrule provides, however, that an information statement described in andSection;1.382-2T(a)(2)(ii) that would be required to be filed solely by reasonof the loss corporation having pre-change capital losses or pre-changecredits is not required to be filed with respect to any taxable year (``priortaxable year'') for which: (1) the due date (including extensions) of theincome tax return of the loss corporation is on or before November 20,1989 or (2) the income tax return is filed on or before October 10, 1989.Under a transitional rule, those corporations which are loss corporationsfor any taxable year ending in 1987, 1988, or 1989 solely by reason ofhaving pre-change capital losses or pre-change credits are required toreport the information specified in andSection;andSection; 1.382-2T(a)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) (relating to certain testing dates) for taxable years endingon or after May 6, 1986 for which it was a loss corporation, excludinginformation reported with a previous information statement. The transitionalrule also requires such loss corporations to state whether and to whatextent pre-change capital losses or pre-change credits utilized in thosetaxable years to which the section 382 limitation applied exceeded theamount permitted under the regulations under section 383 adopted by thisdocument. The transitional rule shall only be applicable to informationstatements filed with the 1988 and 1989 income tax returns. The regulations also are amended to provide that the information statementprescribed by andSection; 1.382-2T(a)(2)(ii) is required to be filed fora taxable year only if certain sales or other transactions relating tothe loss corporation's stock (or options to acquire its stock) occur duringthe year. Sections 1.382-2T(f)(18) (ii)(C) and (iii)(C), and andSection; 1.382-2T(h)(4)(ix)provide rules that apply if ``pre-change losses'' are considered to bede minimis. As a result of the change in the definition of ``pre-changeloss,'' pre-change capital losses and pre-change credits must be takeninto account in determining whether such losses are de minimis. (c) Section 383 Under the regulations promulgated pursuant to section 383, if an ownershipchange occurs with respect to a loss corporation, the section 382 limitationfor a post-change year also applies to limit the amount of capital gainor tax liability that may be offset, respectively, by capital losses andexcess credits of the loss corporation that are attributable to the periodsending on or before the date of the ownership change. Tax attributes thatare attributable to the period ending with the ownership change (``pre-changetax attributes'') and that are affected by the section 382 limitation thusinclude any net operating loss carryovers, net unrealized built-in losses,capital loss carryovers, excess foreign taxes carried over under section904(c), unused general business credits carried over under section 39,and unused minimum tax credits under section 53. For purposes of section383 and these temporary regulations, the rules and principles of section382 and the regulations thereunder (including the meaning and use of termsset forth in section 382 and andSection; 1.382-2T) are applicable, exceptthat appropriate account shall be made of the fact that section 383 andthese temporary regulations apply to certain capital losses and certainenumerated credits. The section 382 limitation for a post-change year limits the extent towhich pre-change tax attributes that are otherwise allowable may be usedin a post-change year. The ordering rules under the temporary regulationsprovide that the section 382 limitation applicable for any post-changeyear is absorbed in sequential order, as follows: (1) Built-in capitallosses recognized during such year, (2) capital loss carryovers, (3) built-inordinary losses recognized during such year, (4) net operating loss carryforward,(5) excess foreign taxes carried over under section 904(c), (6) unusedgeneral business credits carried over under section 39, and (7) unusedminimum tax credits under section 53. These ordering rules follow the orderingrules of the Code which, in the absence of sections 382 and 383, generallywould apply with respect to the use of the pre-change tax attributes ofthe loss corporation. The ``pre-change losses'' (excluding pre-change credits) absorb the section382 limitation on a dollar-for-dollar basis as the pre-change losses areutilized. Because excess credits offset tax liability rather than taxableincome, however, section 383 prescribes that the section 382 limitationwhich applies to limit the amount of taxable income that may be offsetby deductions arising from pre-change losses must be converted to a limitationof equivalent value (the ``section 383 credit limitation'') for the purposeof determining the amount of tax liability that may be offset by pre-changecredits. Under the regulations, the section 383 credit limitation is definedas the amount by which such corporation's regular tax liability would bereduced if it its taxable income for the year were reduced by the amountof its section 382 limitation remaining after taking into account any reductionin the section 382 limitation for the post-change year as the result ofthe loss corporation's use of pre-change losses, other than pre-changecredits (the ``unabsorbed section 382 limitation''). The section 383 creditlimitation thus is equal to the excess of (1) the loss corporation's regulartax liability for the taxable year, over (2) the amount of such liabilityafter allowing as an additional deduction an amount equal to the unabsorbedsection 382 limitation for the year. After all available pre-change losses (including pre-change credits) areapplied against the section 382 limitation and the section 383 credit limitation,the amount, if any, of the unused section 382 limitation that is carriedover to the next taxable year must be computed. This computation requiresthat each dollar of regular tax liability that is offset by a pre-changecredit be ``grossed-up'' (<T3>i.e., </T3>divided by the effective marginal rate at which that dollarof tax was imposed) to determine the amount of taxable income that, ineffect, was offset by the pre-change credit. The sum of these amounts forthe taxable year is then subtracted from the unabsorbed section 382 limitationand the balance, if any, is the unused section 382 limitation that carriesover to the next taxable year under section 382(b)(2). In order to determinethe effective marginal tax rate of the loss corporation, the ``gross-up''computation must take into account those circumstances where differentrates of tax or different bracket amounts are applicable. For example,in the case of a loss corporation that is a component member of a controlledgroup of corporations within the meaning of section 1563(a), the limitationsimposed under section 1561 on the amount of taxable income in each bracketset forth in section 11(b) must be taken into account. Section 383 and the temporary regulations generally apply to any loss corporationwith respect to which an ownership change occurs after December 31, 1986.If section 383 was not taken into account, or was applied other than inaccordance with the regulations under section 383 in a prior taxable yearthe taxpayer should file an amended return and pay additional tax due plusinterest. The temporary regulations relating to the limitations on certain capitallosses and excess credits in computing the alternative minimum tax havebeen reserved, and will be addressed in a future set of regulations. <ITAG tagnum="84">Special Analyses </ITAG>It has been determined that these rules are not major rules as definedin Executive Order 12291. Therefore, a Regulatory Impact Analysis is notrequired. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the AdministrativeProcedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations and, therefore, a finalRegulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f)of the Internal Revenue Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking for theregulations was submitted to the Administrator of the Small Business Administrationfor comment on their impact on small business. <ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information </ITAG>The principal author of these temporary regulations is Lori J.

Thesection 383 credit limitation for a post-change year bears a direct relationshipto the amount, if any, of the section 382 limitation that remains aftertaking into account the reduction in the loss corporation's taxable incomeduring a post-change year as a result of its pre-change losses (as definedin paragraph (c)(4) of this section). In general, the section 383 creditlimitation is an amount equal to the tax liability of the new loss corporationfor the post-change year which is attributable to so much of the corporation'staxable income that would be reduced by allowing as a deduction its section382 limitation remaining after accounting for the use of pre-change losses.As pre-change losses and pre-change credits of a corporation are used,they absorb the section 382 limitation and the section 383 credit limitation,respectively, in the manner prescribed by paragraph (d) of this section.See also section 382 and the regulations thereunder.(c) <T3>Definitions_</T3>(1) <T3>Coordination with definitions and nomenclature used in section 382.</T3>Terms and nomenclature used in this section, and not otherwise definedherein, shall have the same respective meanings as in section 382 and theregulations thereunder, taking into account that the limitations of section383 and this section apply to pre-change capital losses and pre-changecredits.(2) <T3>Pre-change capital loss. </T3>The term ``pre-change capital loss''means_(i) Any capital loss carryover under section 1212 of the old loss corporationto the taxable year ending on the change date or in which the change dateoccurs,(ii) Any net capital loss of the old loss corporation for the taxable yearin which the ownership change occurs, to the extent such loss is attributableto the period in such year ending on or before the change date, and (iii) If the old loss corporation has a net unrealized built-in loss, anyrecognized built-in loss for any recognition period taxable year (withinthe meaning of section 382(h)) that is a capital loss.(3) <T3>Pre-change credit. </T3>The term ``pre-change credit'' means_(i) Any excess foreign taxes under section 904(c) of the old loss corporation_(A) carried forward to the taxable year ending on the change date or inwhich the change date occurs, or(B) carried forward from the taxable year that includes the change date,to the extent such credit is attributable to the period in such year endingon or before the change date,(ii) Any credit under section 38 of the old loss corporation_(A) carried forward to the taxable year ending on the change date or inwhich the change date occurs, or(B) carried forward from a taxable year that includes the change date tothe extent such credit is attributable to the period in such year endingon or before the change date, and (iii) The available minimum tax credit of the old loss corporation undersection 53 to the extent attributable to periods ending on or before thechange date.(4) <T3>Pre-change loss. </T3>Solely for purposes of this section, the term``pre-change loss'' means any pre-change loss described in andSection; 1.382-2T(f)(22)other than pre-change credits described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.(5) <T3>Regular tax liability. </T3>For purposes of this section, the term``regular tax liability'' has the same meaning as provided in section 26(b).(6) <T3>Section 383 credit limitation_</T3>(i) <T3>Definition. </T3>The ``section 383 credit limitation'' for a post-changeyear of a new loss corporation is an amount equal to the excess of_(A) The new loss corporation's regular tax liability for the post-changeyear, over(B) The new loss corporation's regular tax liability for the post-changeyear computed, for this purpose, by allowing as an additional deductionan amount equal to the section 382 limitation remaining after the applicationof paragraphs (d)(2) (i) through (iv) of this section.(ii) <T3>Example. </T3>L, a new loss corporation, is a calendar year taxpayer.L has an ownership change on December 31, 1987. For 1988, L has taxableincome (prior to the use of any pre-change losses) of $100,000. In addition,L has a section 382 limitation of $25,000, a pre-change net operating losscarryover of $12,000, a pre-change minimum tax credit of $50,000, and nopre-change capital losses. L's section 383 credit limitation is the excessof its regular tax liability computed after allowing a $12,000 net operatingloss deduction (taxable income of $88,000; regular tax liability of $18,170),over its regular tax liability computed after allowing an additional deductionin the amount of L's section 382 limitation remaining after the applicationof paragraphs (d)(2) (i) through (iv) of this section, or $13,000 (taxableincome of $75,000; regular tax liability of $13,750). L's section 383 creditlimitation is therefore $4,420 ($18,170 minus $13,750).(d) <T3>Limitation on use of pre-change losses and pre-change credits_</T3>(1)<T3>In general. </T3>The amount of taxable income of a new loss corporationfor any post-change year that may be offset by pre-change losses shallnot exceed the amount of the section 382 limitation for the post-changeyear.

Thesection 382 limitation is absorbed by one dollar for each dollar of pre-changeloss that is used to offset taxable income. The section 383 credit limitationis absorbed by one dollar for each dollar of pre-change credit that isused to offset regular tax liability. For each post-change year, the section382 limitation and the section 383 credit limitation of a new loss corporationare absorbed by such corporation's pre-change losses and pre-change creditsin the following order:(i) Pre-change capital losses described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of thissection that are recognized and are subject to the section 382 limitationin such post-change year,(ii) Pre-change capital losses described in paragraphs (c)(2) (i) and (ii)of this section,(iii) Pre-change losses that are described in andSection; 1.382-2T(f)(22)(iii)(other than losses that are pre-change capital losses) that are recognizedand are subject to the section 382 limitation in such post-change year,(iv) Pre-change losses not described in paragraphs (d)(2) (i) through (iii)of this section,(v) Pre-change credits described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section(excess foreign taxes),(vi) Pre-change credits described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section(business credits), and(vii) Pre-change credits described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section(minimum tax credit).(3) <T3>Coordination with other limitations_</T3>(i) <T3>In general. </T3>Paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of this section shall beapplied after the application of all other limitations contained in subtitleA which are applicable to the use of a pre-change loss or pre-change creditin a post-change year. Thus, only otherwise currently allowable pre-changelosses and pre-change credits will result in the absorption of the section382 limitation and the section 383 credit limitation.(ii) <T3>Examples:</T3><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>L is a calendar year taxpayer and has an ownershipchange on December 31, 1987. For 1988, L has taxable income of $300,000,a regular tax liability of $100,250 and a tentative minimum tax of $90,000.L has no pre-change losses, but has a business credit carryforward from1985 of $25,000, no portion of which is due to the regular percentage ofthe investment tax credit under section 46. L has a section 382 limitationfor 1988 of $50,000. L's section 383 credit limitation is $19,500, i.e.,an amount equal to the excess of L's regular tax liability ($100,250) overits regular tax liability calculated by allowing an additional deductionof $50,000. Pursuant to the limitation contained in section 38(c), however,L is entitled to use only $10,250 of its business credit carryforward in1988. The unabsorbed portion of L's section 382 limitation (computed pursuantto paragraph (e) of this section) is carried forward under section 382(b)(2).The unused portion of L's business credit carryforward, $14,750, is carriedforward to the extent provided in section 39.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>Assume the same facts as in <T3>Example (1), </T3>except that L's tentative minimum tax is $70,000.L's use of its investment tax credit carryforward is no longer limitedby section 38(c); however, pursuant to section 383 and this section, Lis entitled to use only $19,500 of its business credit carryforward in1988. The unused portion of L's business credit carryforward, $5,500, iscarried forward to the extent provided in section 39. There is no unusedsection 382 limitation to be carried forward.</ITAG>(e) <T3>Carryforward of unused section 382 limitation_</T3>(1) <T3>Computation of carryforward amount. </T3>The section 382 limitationthat can be carried forward under section 382(b)(2) is the excess, if any,of (i) the section 382 limitation for the post-change year remaining afterthe application of paragraphs (d)(2) (i) through (iv) of this section,over (ii) the section 383 credit reduction amount for that post-changeyear.(2) <T3>Section 383 credit reduction amount. </T3>The section 383 credit reductionamount for a post-change year is equal to the amount of taxable incomeattributable to the portion of the new loss corporation's regular tax liabilityfor the year that is offset by pre-change credits. Each dollar of regulartax liability that is offset by a dollar of pre-change credit is dividedby the effective marginal rate at which that dollar of tax was imposedto determine the amount of taxable income that resulted in that particulardollar of regular tax liability. The sum of these ``grossed-up'' amountsfor the taxable year is the section 383 credit reduction amount. In determiningthe effective marginal rate at which a dollar of tax was imposed, specialrules regarding rates of tax (<T3>e.g., </T3>sections 11(b) (2) and (15) or taxable income brackets (<T3>e.g., </T3>section 1561), or both, shall be taken into account. SeeExample (3) in paragraph (f) of this section illustrating the effect ofsection 1561(a). Paragraph (e)(3) of this section illustrates the gross-upcomputation of the section 383 credit reduction amount based on the taxtable and the rates of tax prescribed by section 11(b) as in effect fortaxable years beginning on January 1, 1988.(3) <T3>Computation of section 383 credit reduction amount; illustration usingtax rates and brackets in effect for calendar year 1988. </T3>(i) Assumingno special rules regarding rates of tax or taxable income brackets apply,the section 383 credit reduction amount for a new loss corporation is thesum of the amounts determined under paragraphs (e)(3) (ii), (iii), (iv),(v), and (vi) of this section.(ii) The amount determined under this subdivision (ii) is the amount (ifany) by which pre-change credits offset so much of the new loss corporation'sregular tax liability as exceeds $113,900, divided by 0.34.(iii) The amount determined under this subdivision (e)(3)(iii) is the amount(if any) by which pre-change credits offset so much of the new loss corporation'sregular tax liability as exceeds $22,250 (but does not exceed $113,900),divided by 0.39.(iv) The amount determined under this subdivision (e)(3)(iv) is the amount(if any) by which pre-change credits offset so much of the new loss corporation'sregular tax liability as exceeds $13,750 (but does not exceed $22,250),divided by 0.34.(v) The amount determined under this subdivision (e)(3)(v) is the amount(if any) by which pre-change credits offset so much of the new loss corporation'sregular tax liability as exceeds $7,500 (but does not exceed $13,750),divided by 0.25.(vi) The amount determined under this subdivision (e)(3)(vi) is the amount(if any) by which pre-change credits offset so much of the new loss corporation'sregular tax liability as does not exceed $7,500, divided by 0.15.(4) <T3>Special rules for determining the section 383 credit reduction amount_</T3>(i)<T3>Ordering rules. </T3>For purposes of this paragraph (e), credits, includingpre-change credits, are considered to offset regular tax liability in theorder that such credits are applied under the ordering rules of part IVof subchapter A of chapter 1 and section 904. For example, for purposesof this paragraph (e), excess foreign taxes carried over under section904(c) (whether or not a pre-change credit) are considered (under section38(c)) to offset regular tax liability before the general business creditunder section 38, and general business credits arising in the taxable yearare considered (under section 39) to offset regular tax liability beforegeneral business credit carryovers to the taxable year.(ii) <T3>Special rule for credits under section 38(a). </T3>For purposes ofapplying this paragraph (e), credits under section 38(a) that, under section38(c)(2), effectively offset both regular tax liability and the tax imposedby section 55 (relating to minimum tax), are considered to offset regulartax liability.(f) <T3>Examples. </T3>The following examples illustrate the operation of paragraphs(b) through (e) of this section. For purposes of these examples, the term``modified tax liability'' means the amount determined under paragraph(c)(6)(i)(B) of this section.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>(i) L, a calendar year taxpayer, has an ownershipchange on December 31, 1987. Before the application of carryovers, L, anew loss corporation, has $60,000 of capital gain, $100,000 of ordinarytaxable income and a section 382 limitation of $100,000 for its first post-changeyear beginning after the change date. L's only carryovers are an $80,000capital loss carryover and a $100,000 net operating loss carryover. Bothcarryovers are from taxable years ending before the change date and thusare pre-change losses.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) L first uses $60,000 of its pre-change capital loss carryoverto offset its capital gain. This reduces its section 382 limitation to$40,000 (i.e., $100,000^$60,000). L's pre-change net operating loss carryovercan therefore be used only to the extent of $40,000. L's remaining $20,000pre-change capital loss carryover and remaining $60,000 pre-change netoperating loss carryover are carried to later years to the extent permittedunder this section and sections 172, 382(1)(2) and 1212.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>(i) L, a calendar year taxpayer, has an ownershipchange on December 31, 1987.

L's only carryovers are from pre-1987 taxable yearsand consist of a $500,000 net operating loss (``NOL'') carryover and a$200,000 foreign tax credit carryover, all of which may be used under thesection 904 limitation.
