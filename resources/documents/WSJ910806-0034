The carriers' filing requests final approval no later thanOct. 1 and argues that speedy action is needed for Pan Am to&quot;remain a viable competitor and to save jobs.&quot; Pan Am Corp.,the airline's New York-based parent, is operating underChapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection and with little cash.Friday, Pan Am announced it is laying off about 5,000employees.</LP><TEXT>   In its agreement on the route sale, Delta says it willhire 6,500 Pan Am employees.   The trans-Atlantic routes are part of Delta's pending $310million purchase of Pan Am assets, which also includes thePan Am Shuttle and Frankfurt hub of operations. Route salesrequire government approval.   In the filing, the airlines argued that approval of theroute transfer &quot;will give Delta a critical mass oftrans-Atlantic operations necessary to be a more effectivecompetitor against U.S. and foreign-flag rivals.&quot;   Delta said the Detroit-London and Miami-London routes itwants to acquire as part of the package will &quot;significantlystrengthen&quot; its competitive position in the U.S.-Londonmarket. Those routes could be hotly contested. NWA Inc.'sNorthwest Airlines has bid for the Detroit-London route,while UAL Corp.'s United Airlines included the Miami-Londonroute in an offer it presented, and later withdrew, for PanAm's Latin American operations.   Delta said it &quot;urgently needs these two London routes tobe able to counterbalance the market strength of the dominantU.S.-U.K. carriers,&quot; which includes United, AMR Corp.'sAmerican Airlines and British Airways PLC.   After the transfer, Delta said, its traffic to the UnitedKingdom would &quot;approach&quot; that of Northwest but would remain&quot;significantly&quot; behind that of American, Continental Airlinesand United. Continental is a unit of Continental AirlinesHoldings Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
