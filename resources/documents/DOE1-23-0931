The neutron spectrumis gradually shifted toward a more moderated state to compensate forthe depleted fuel. The reactor includes a pressure vessel enclosing areactor core and having an inlet and an outlet for circulating a watercoolant moderator in heat transfer relationship with the core. The corecomprises fuel assemblies disposed therein for generating heat by nuclearfission. The fuel assemblies have a fuel enrichment which provides ameasure of excess reactivity at the beginning of core life which is laterdrawn upon to lengthen core life. The reactor is provided with neutron-absorbingcontrol rods which are vertically movable into and out of the core sothat movement of the control rods into the core will substantially decreasereactivity and withdrawal of the control rods from the core will substantiallyincrease reactivity, the control rods when inserted into the core displacingan equivalent volume of the water coolant moderator. The reactor is alsoprovided with neutron-spectral-shift displacer rods which have a substantiallylower absorptivity for neutrons than the control rods.</TEXT></DOC>
