The satellite plant has been a success. The company saves on taxes and energy costs. And though Jetson's mostly female work force in rural Pennsylvania gets paid about the same as the company's Long Island employees, turnover among established workers is virtually nil.    As other companies take similar steps to avoid tight labor supplies, cities in the industrial backwaters -- with names synonymous to many with Nowheresville -- are on the verge of taking off. Plant-location consultants say the communities best positioned to benefit from this new economic wave are those with an abundant supply of labor, preferably educated for white-collar jobs. If the community is just outside a booming economic area, say California's Silicon Valley, so much the better.    &quot;Labor shortage is the No. 1 challenge facing American business today, without a doubt,&quot; says Dennis Donovan, senior vice president at Moran, Stahl andamp; Boyer Inc., a New York business-location consultant. Sharply diminished labor pools -- and increased living costs -- have caused the allure of entrepreneurial hotbeds such as greater Boston and Santa Clara County, Calif., to wane in recent years.    Rising to replace them are communities on the fringes of the New England-New York City area, Mr. Donovan says. These offer most of the advantages of the bigger Northeastern cities but without the hassles of an inadequate labor supply.    &quot;I think you're going to see significant business expansion in Buffalo, Syracuse, Pittsfield, Mass., and eastern Pennsylvania for sure, maybe even in places like Altoona,&quot; Mr. Donovan says. These locales, once the home of heavy manufacturing, have an industrial infrastructure in place, plus a strong supply of workers.    &quot;These are some of the best labor markets in the country, but they suffer from an image problem,&quot; Mr. Donovan says.    Of course, image isn't the only downside of moving to the industrial boondocks. Companies may find that the distance to major markets or to corporate headquarters is a disadvantage. And managers sometimes balk at moving to communities where the sidewalks roll up at 5 p.m.    Also, once a community catches on and companies move in, the area's chief advantage -- a surplus of workers -- may dwindle. For that reason, James Wadley, president of James P. Wadley andamp; Co., a location consultant in Morristown, N.J., recommends moving to areas where the population is growing rapidly -- either because people are moving there in large numbers, as in northern Florida, or because of above-average birth rates, as in Utah.    L. Clinton Hoch, chairman of Metropolitan Consulting Group, New York, says expansion-minded companies should be wary of areas with unemployment rates below the U.S. average, which was a seasonally adjusted 5.6% in May. &quot;Any place that's under 4%, we're scratching automatically,&quot; Mr. Hoch says. That nixes Connecticut; Delaware; Orange County, Calif.; Richmond, Va., and Tallahassee, Fla.    On Mr. Hoch's list of currently favored sites for manufacturers: Springfield, Mass.; Scranton and Wilkes-Barre, Pa.; Battle Creek, Mich.; Sacramento, Calif.; Portland, Ore., and El Paso, Texas.    Companies seeking office space for white-collar operations should look at Indianapolis, downtown St. Louis, and Memphis, Tenn., Mr. Hoch says. &quot;Buffalo is a comer. Rochester is basically full.&quot;    A few cities off the beaten path already have successfully marketed themselves to take advantage of companies' data-processing needs. Macon, Ga., for instance, is a claims-processing outpost for Aetna Life andamp; Casualty, Geico Corp., and Cigna Corp.    PHH Fantus Corp., a location consulting firm in Chicago, uses a gauge called FIRE -- measuring jobs in finance, insurance and real estate as a percent of total employment -- to show that these small cities now have about the same level of white-collar workers as some major metropolitan areas. The FIRE figure for Macon is 6.5%, for instance, compared with Atlanta, 7.2%, and Chicago, 8.6%. </TEXT></DOC>
