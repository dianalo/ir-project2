The regulations will lay down codes of conduct for thetreatment of these assets, which along with Iraqi investmentsin the U.S. were frozen by President Bush following Iraq'sinvasion of Kuwait.</LP><TEXT>   Kuwait is estimated to hold about $50 billion of assets inthe U.S., according to David Mizrahi, editor and publisher ofMidEast Report, a New York-based newsletter that tracks Arabinvestments in the U.S. These are mainly held in real estate,stocks and bonds, he says, adding that Kuwait's investment inoil refiner Santa Fe International probably ranks among thelargest Kuwaiti holdings in the U.S.   The Treasury -- for the time being, at least -- declinesto quantify Kuwait's investments in the U.S. In a recentbriefing, Richard Newcomb, the department's director offoreign assets control, would only say they are&quot;significant.&quot;   Iraq, in contrast to Kuwait, has relatively smallinvestments in the U.S., probably a few hundred milliondollars or less.   One of the reasons that Kuwaiti investments may be hardfor the Treasury to track is because the country and itscitizens, in common with many rich Arabs, have generallypreferred discreet and low-profile investments in the U.S.,bankers familiar with Kuwait's investment strategy say.Kuwait has generally avoided shareholdings of more than 5% inpublicly quoted companies in order to avoid the requirementto disclose holdings.   Kuwait's desire to build up an international oilexploration and refining business seems to be the exceptionto that general rule. A Commerce Department report on foreigndirect investment in the U.S. for 1988 lists only one Kuwaitiinvestment in the U.S. for that year: the $28.6 millionacquisition of Exploration Co. of Louisiana Inc. by theKuwaiti government.   In the mid-1970s then-Treasury Secretary William Simonagreed that rich Middle East nations wouldn't be subject topublic country-by-country breakdowns of their investments inthe U.S., according to Mr. Mizrahi. But Mr. Mizrahi contendsthat such breakdowns have been kept confidentially by theTreasury.   Meanwhile, the administration recently set out its policyto Kuwaiti banks in a letter dated Aug. 5 from the Treasury'sMr. Newcomb to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.   Mr. Newcomb's letter sets out four categories of Kuwaitibanks. The first comprises banks that are considered &quot;blockedentities&quot; that can't make transactions with persons underU.S. jurisdiction. They include Bank of Kuwait and the MiddleEast, Burgan Bank, Central Bank of Kuwait, Credit de Bergues,Kuwait Finance House and Savings and Credit Bank. Alsoblocked are banks over which Kuwait is deemed to have &quot;defacto control&quot; -- Al-Ahli Bank, Commercial Bank of Kuwait,Industrial Bank of Kuwait and Gulf Bank.   There are also five banks with some Kuwaiti governmentownership; these institutions' transactions will beauthorized pending a final determination by Aug. 18. Anothercategory is made up of 11 banks that Mr. Newcomb's lettersays &quot;shouldn't be considered&quot; blocked entities but on whichthe department is seeking more information by Aug. 18.</TEXT></DOC>
