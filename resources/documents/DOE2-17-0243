Multiple-beamFizeau fringes in transmission and in reflection are used in this studyfor the determination of the refractive indices and birefringence of{gamma}-irradiated Dralon fibres. Variation of the refractive indicesof these fibres with the temperature and wavelength of light are alsostudied. Empirical formulae are suggested to correlate the optical propertiesof the irradiated fibres with the applied dose. Lorenz-Lorentz equationis applied to calculate the polarizability of the irradiated fibres perunit volume. Illustrations are given by multiple-beam microinterferogramsin transmission and in reflection.</TEXT></DOC>
