At least five other major oil concerns quickly agreed to follow the pattern set by the agreement reached at Amoco's Casper, Wyo., and Yorktown, Va., refineries. Denver-based OCAW typically conducts so-called pattern bargaining, seeking an agreement with one major oil company that it then tries to duplicate throughout the industry.    The preliminary agreement, which must be ratified by members, provides for a 2.1% wage increase immediately, a 3% wage increase in the second year and a separate lump sum payment of $900 to each worker.    But OCAW, which represents about 44,000 oil workers, acknowledged that it gained no new ground on a fundamental issue -- job security in an industry that grows increasingly automated. &quot;There is quite a bit of disappointment,&quot; said Rodney Rogers, an OCAW spokesman, &quot;because we were unable to get the companies to address job security, to get companies to take the human aspects of job losses and plant closings into account.&quot;    OCAW workers gained little ground on wages either, taking inflation into account. The &quot;real&quot; wages of the average refinery worker fell 59 cents an hour during the last two-year contract period, when discounted for inflation, OCAW said. Under the tentative contract, the average OCAW-represented refinery worker earning a base hourly wage of $14.44 will see an hourly wage jump of 74 cents. The $900 lump sum per active employee provides some additional cushion for future inflation, however.    The union was unable to fulfill its demand for an additional holiday for the birthday of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.    However, under the tentative pacts with Amoco, the workers will receive sought-after improvements in their medical insurance plans. The oil concern agreed to increase its contribution to the hospital and medical insurance as much as an additional $10 a month per employee the first year and as much as an additional $12 a month per employee in the second year.    The Amoco settlement triggered similar tentative offers at refineries operated by Shell Oil Co., a Houston-based unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group; Ashland, Ky.-based Ashland Oil Inc.; Conoco Inc., a Houston-based unit of Du Pont Co.; Los Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield Co.; and White Plains, N.Y.-based Texaco Inc. But those offers must be approved by OCAW's National Oil Bargaining Policy Committee before being submitted to members.    Contracts expired Sunday under threat of OCAW's first oil-industry strike in eight years. Negotiation deadlines have been extended 24 hours to 72 hours, a union spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
