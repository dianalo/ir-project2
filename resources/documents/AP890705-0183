Coffee beans for September delivery closed at $1,387 a metric tonTuesday in London, down $98 from Monday's final price. Earlier inthe day, the price fell to $1,343.   Selling was particularly heavy in London on Tuesday because theNew York market was closed for the Fourth of July holiday.   The 74-nation organization of coffee consumer- andproducer-nations announced the suspension of quotas late Monday,after members rejected proposals to extend the existinginternational coffee pact. The suspensions took effect at midnight.   The price of coffee, which reached this year's peak of $1,896 aton in January, had been falling steadily ahead of Monday'semergency meeting.   Export quotas have been in force since the early 1960s, apartfrom a 19-month break in 1986-87 and a six-year gap in the 1970s.They are used to keep surplus coffee off the market in an effort tobalance supply with demand and so maintain the average world priceabove a target minimum of $1.20 a pound.   With the quotas gone, traders predicted a free-for-all amongexporting countries seeking to raise their market shares.   Many delegates blamed the organization's failure to reach a newdeal on the hard line of the United States, the main consumingnation, and the tough position of the 11-nation Group of MildArabica Producers, largely comprised of Central American producers,not to extend quotas.   Singapore was the only other consuming nation besides the UnitedStates to vote against the extension.   The Mild Arabica Producers, led by Mexico and Costa Rica, pressedfor guarantees of a bigger slice of the market before they wouldagree to support an extension of the quotas.   Their proposals were backed by the United States, but roundlydefeated when put to a vote.   Colombia _ the world's second-biggest producer, for which coffeerepresents 40 percent of its export income _ led the fight to keepthe coffee agreement and its quota system alive.   Colombia has been much more active than Brazil, the biggestproducer. Coffee now generates less than 10 percent of Brazilianforeign exchange.</TEXT></DOC>
