(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A secret new spy satellite circledthe globe in a useless orbit Saturday, leaving the United States tocontinue relying on aging systems for eavesdropping and warning ofmissile attacks.   The satellite, said to be designed for intercepting Sovietcommunications, was propelled into a successful preliminary orbitby a $65 million Titan 34D rocket launched here Friday.   But a source close to the project said the spacecraft failed toachieve a desired stationary orbit 22,300 miles high when the upperstage of the rocket failed to re-ignite.   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said thesatellite remained in a sharply elliptical orbit ranging from about100 to 22,300 miles above Earth.   He said the payload was useless on that course and there waslittle hope of salvaging the mission.   The Air Force, as is its custom with military launches, did notannounce the liftoff in advance. Several minutes after launch, withthe Titan apparently working well, it reported a successful startto the mission.   Asked about the reported failure, Air Force Lt. Col. Ron Rand,director of public affairs at the Eastern Space and Missile Centerhere, said the Pentagon had a policy of not commenting on theresults of military space flights.   John E. Pike, a space policy expert for the Washington-basedFederation of American Scientists, said the satellite wascode-named Vortex, a series designed to monitor Soviet missiletests and military and diplomatic electronic communications.   It was intended to replace a satellite that has been in use forseveral years and is showing signs of wear, the source reported.   Aging is a problem with many of America's military satellitesand is causing concern among military planners, who over the lasttwo decades have relied heavily on space-based systems forreconnaissance, communications, electronic eavesdropping,missile-attack alert and navigation.   Since the space shuttle Challenger explosion and a Titan 34Dblowup, both in early 1986, the Pentagon has been limited in itsability to lift heavy satellites into orbit to replace oldersystems, many of which continue to operate long past theiranticipated operational lifetimes.   The Titan 34D, the United States' most powerful unmanned rocket,was grounded for redesign for 18 months following its 1986 failure.   Flights resumed late last year with two straight successes _deployment of reconnaissance and missile attack warning satellites,the only two heavy U.S. military payloads launched successfully inthe last 2{ years.   Friday's launch was the first for the Titan 34D since those 1987flights, and it had been delayed several months by technicalproblems.   Only three more Titan 34Ds remain in the inventory, with therocket to be replaced starting later this year by the more powerfulTitan 4.   The redesigned space shuttle is scheduled to resume flights latethis month or in early October, and the Pentagon has bookedcritically needed military satellites on five of the first ninemissions.   Even before Challenger, the Defense Department realized it wasdepending too much on the shuttle for access to space and begandeveloping the Titan 4 over the objection of the NationalAeronautics and Space Administration.   The Air Force is shepherding the construction of 50 Titan 4s anda large number of smaller Delta 2s and Titan 2s to launch a familyof military satellites over the next several years, graduallycutting back on its use of the shuttle.</TEXT></DOC>
