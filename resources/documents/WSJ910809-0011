Somatogen slid 1 to 26 1/4, but is still more than 38%above its Aug. 1 offering price of $19 a share. Thesuccessful initial public offering of the Boulder, Colo.,company has rejuvenated demand for biotechnology stockofferings lately. Earlier, investors' appetites for the riskyyoung companies had cooled after Regeneron Pharmaceuticalsfell below half its April offering price.</LP><TEXT>   Meanwhile, other over-the-counter stocks shrugged off thelosses of larger stocks traded on the major exchanges androse for the third consecutive session. But the gains weren'tbroad-based.   The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1.93 to 509.39, a 0.38%advance, compared with a 0.42% drop in the Dow JonesIndustrial Average and a 0.24% loss in the New York StockExchange Composite Index. OTC gainers barely outnumbereddecliners 956 to 900, as 141 stocks climbed to new highs and31 fell to new lows. OTC volume fell to 161.6 million sharesfrom 177.3 million Wednesday.   Somatogen, which is developing a synthetic blood usinghuman hemoglobin produced by genetically engineered bacteria,has a total market value of $193.3 million at yesterday'sclosing price of 26 1/4. That's a bit rich, say severalinstitutional investors, for a company with some stiffcompetition that hasn't yet begun testing its product onhumans. Most young new biotechnology stocks, includingbellwether Amgen, have dropped below their offering pricesbefore successfully marketing a product.   &quot;You can buy them later at a cheaper price and still makemoney&quot; after studies on humans have begun and the company ismuch further along the long road to commercial success, saysone portfolio manager, who asked not to be named.   Somatogen hopes to begin studies on a small group ofpeople this fall, but there's no assurance of success:Early-stage trials of two blood substitute products developedby other companies were recently halted because of safetyconcerns. Making safe and pure blood substitutes remains akey challenge to developers of synthetic blood, says Col.John Hess, chief of blood research at the U.S. Army'sLetterman Institute for Research in San Francisco.   But the potential demand is enormous for long-lastingsynthetic blood free of viruses such as AIDS and hepatitis.&quot;The Army sent 120,000 pints around the world this spring&quot;during Operation Desert Storm, Col. Hess said, &quot;and most ofit had a shelf life of six weeks.&quot;   Somatogen's biggest challenge is whether &quot;they can makeenough of it cheaply enough,&quot; says James McCamant, editor ofthe Medical Technology Stock Letter in Berkeley, Calif.Somatogen, however, has yet to build the manufacturingfacility needed to produce huge quantities of the syntheticblood. It will use some of the proceeds from its offering toacquire a site for the facility.   Some big investors say they're willing to take an earlyrisk on the company because of its potential: Somatogenestimates a potential $5 billion world-wide annual market forblood substitutes used in surgery. That was enough to enticeBarry Feirstein, growth-stock manager for Equitable CapitalManagement Corp. in New York, to risk a small amount of his$840 million under management on Somatogen shares after theysoared in first-day trading. &quot;It's extremely risky,&quot; he says.&quot;It may go to zero, or it may go to a few hundred dollars. Ifthe drug proves to be safe, this could be huge.&quot;   Among other young biotechnology stocks, ICOS Corp. jumped2 1/4 to 16 3/8. The Seattle company, which went public inJune at $8 a share, said it's discussing a possible agreementwith Glaxo Holdings PLC to collaborate in developing enzymesused in treating inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases.   Meanwhile, Microsoft's three-point climb to 79 helped pullover-the-counter stocks higher. The software concern is thelargest stock in the Nasdaq Composite Index.   Leading the activity in the market was Avantek, whichnearly doubled in price on volume of 4.1 million shares. Themaker of microwave electronics used in cellular radios andcordless telephones entered a pact to be acquired byHewlett-Packard for $4.60 a share, or a total of $82.8million. Avantek jumped 2 3/16 to 4 7/16.   Utility-related stocks were strong. The Nasdaq UtilityIndex posted a 7.11, or 1.24%, rise to 580.22.   MCI Communications gained 7/8 to 29 3/8,Tele-Communications Class A shares rose 1/4 to 14 1/8, LINBroadcasting advanced 1/2 to 70 1/2, McCaw CellularCommunications climbed 3/4 to 26 1/4 and Citizens Utilitiesincreased 3/8 to 26 1/4.   Several new issues continued to trade actively, each atleast matching their offering price at the close. Wednesday,six initial public offerings came to market, each closingabove their offering price on volume that accounted for 10%of the market's total activity.   Rogers Cantel Mobile Communications finished at itsoffering price of 17 on volume of 2.6 million shares. A totalof 14 million shares of its Class B common were offered.   Pharmchem Laboratories closed at 9 3/8, above its $8.50 ashare offering price, on volume of 1.8 million shares. Twomillion shares were offered.   Capital Bancorp gained 1/2 from its offering price toclose at 15 on volume of 414,500. About one million shares ofcommon were offered.   Sun Microsystems slipped 1 7/8 to 32 1/4. Traders, inpart, attributed the decline to profit-taking following thestock's recent strength, according to Dow Jones ProfessionalInvestor Report. After the market closed, the computerworkstation concern posted net income of 63 cents a share forits fiscal fourth quarter ended June 30, compared with 51cents a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by First Call, a unitof Thomson Financial Networks, gave a mean estimate of 61cents a share for the latest quarter.</TEXT></DOC>
