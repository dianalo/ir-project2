Background</ITAG>Section 1905(d) of the Social Security Act (the Act) permits Medicaid coveragefor services provided by intermediate care facilities for the mentallyretarded (ICFs/MR). The primary purpose of an ICF/MR is to provide healthor rehabilitative services for mentally retarded individuals.ICFs/MR participate in the Medicaid program under provider agreements withState Medicaid agencies. In order to enter into a provider agreement, anICF/MR must first be certified by a State survey agency as complying withstandards set forth in 42 CFR Part 442, Subpart G. Facilities are surveyedat least annually by State survey agencies to ascertain their continuedcompliance with these requirements. Section 1910(c) of the Act authorizesthe Secretary to conduct validation (direct Federal) surveys to determinethe correctness of Medicaid certification actions taken by the designatedState survey agency. In addition, if the Secretary finds that an ICF/MRsubstantially fails to meet the requirements of participation in the Medicaidprogram, the Secretary may terminate the ICF/MR's participation in theMedicaid program.Section 1910(c)(2) of the Act sets forth the appeals procedures availablewhen we terminate a facility's participation in the program. Under thatprovision, ICFs/MR have a right to a full evidentiary hearing before theeffective date of termination of the provider agreement unless the Secretarymakes a written determination that the facility's deficiencies pose animmediate and serious threat to the recipients.The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA), Pub.L. 99-272, was enacted on April 7, 1986. Section 9516 of Pub. L. 99-272amended title XIX of the Act by adding section 1919. Section 1919 of theAct provides States options under which ICFs/MR that are found by the Secretaryto have substantial deficiencies only in physical plant and staffing thatdo not pose an immediate threat to clients' health and safety may remedythose deficiencies. The statute provides the State Medicaid agency withoptions to submit written plans to the Secretary either to make all necessarystaff and physical plant corrections and correct all other minor deficienciesas well, within 6 months of the approval date of the plan, or to reducepermanently the number of beds in certified units within 36 months of theapproval date of the plan.If, at the conclusion of a 6-month plan of correction, the Secretary determinesthat the State has substantially failed to correct the cited deficiencies,the Secretary may terminate the cited ICF/MR's provider agreement in accordancewith section 1910(c) of the Act. In the case of a reduction plan, if theSecretary determines, at the conclusion of the initial 6-month period orany 6-month interval thereafter, that the State has substantially failedto meet the requirements of the reduction plan, the Secretary may terminatethe ICF/MR's provider agreement in accordance with section 1910(c) of theAct, or if the State has failed to meet the reduction plan requirementsdespite good faith efforts, disallow Federal financial participation (FFP)equal to five percent of the cost of care for all eligible individualsin the ICF/MR for each month for which the State fails to meet the reductionplan requirements.In accordance with the provisions of section 1919 of the Act, we publisheda proposed rule on July 25, 1986 (51 FR 26718). Section III of the preambleto the proposed rule (51 FR 26719) provides a detailed explanation of theprovisions of section 1919 of the Act.On December 22, 1987, Congress enacted the Omnibus Budget ReconciliationAct of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-203). Section 4217(b) of Pub. L. 100-203 specifiesthat the regulations promulgated under section 1919 of Pub. L. 99-272 shallbe effective as if promulgated on the date of enactment of Pub. L. 99-272(that is, April 7, 1986).<ITAG tagnum="85">II. Current Alternatives to Termination From Medicaid </ITAG>As we stated in the proposed rule, current Medicaid regulations permitState survey agencies to provide an alternative to termination for ICFs/MRfound to have deficiencies that do not pose immediate jeopardy to clients'health and safety. Sections 442.105 through 442.111 specify the conditionsunder which a facility found by a State survey agency to have deficienciesthat do not jeopardize clients' health and safety may continue to be certifiedunder Medicaid for a period of up to 12 months while the facility correctsthe deficiencies.In addition, we published a final rule on July 3, 1986 (51 FR 24484) thatpermits a Medicaid agency to deny payment for new admissions to an ICF/MRthat no longer meets the standards for ICFs and ICFs/MR specified under42 CFR Part 442, Subparts D through G, if the ICF/MR's deficiencies donot pose immediate jeopardy to clients' health and safety (andSection;442.118(a)(1)).The Medicaid agency may deny payment for 11 months after the month thedenial was imposed.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Provisions of the Proposed Regulations</ITAG>In order to implement section 1919 of the Act, we proposed to amend theMedicaid regulations in 42 CFR Part 442. A complete discussion of the proposedchanges is provided below:A. Basis and Purpose (andSection;442.1)We proposed to add to andSection;442.1 the statutory authority for permittingState Medicaid agencies to submit to us correction and reduction plansfor deficient ICFs/MR. Although the statute refers generally to the State,we believe it is necessary to specify the agency that would be accountablefor compliance with the statute and these regulations.B. Terms (andSection; 442.2)We proposed to add to the definition of ``immediate jeopardy'' in andSection;442.2, the term ``immediate threat''. We believe Congress did not intendany substantive differences between the two terms. We believe that we shouldapply the same meaning to both terms, so that we may avoid needless confusionin attempting to discern the qualitative differences between the two terms.C. Correction and Reduction Plans: General Provisions (andSection; 442.114)We proposed to add a new andSection; 442.114 that would provide States additionaloptions under which ICFs/MR that we find have substantial deficienciesonly in physical plant and staffing that do not pose an immediate threatto clients' health and safety may remedy those deficiencies. Generally,such findings would result from validation surveys under section 1910(c)of the Act, but these findings could also result from direct Federal investigationof a complaint or other circumstances. We would provide the State Medicaidagency with options to submit to us, within specified time frames, writtenplans to either correct all necessary staff and physical plant deficiencies,and all other minor deficiencies, within 6 months of the approval dateof the plan in accordance with new andSection; 442.115, or reduce permanentlythe number of beds in certified untis within 36 months of the approvaldate of the plan in accordance with new andSection; 442.116. While the statuteand legislative history clearly provide these options for ICFs/MR withsubstantial deficiencies only in physical plant and staffing, we recognizethat ICFs/MR with these deficiencies will likely have other deficienciesas well. As long as these other deficiencies are minor, the ICF/MR maystill be eligible for a correction or reduction plan. We expect that ifa correction plan is chosen, <T3>all</T3> physical plant and staffing as well as other remaining minordeficiencies will be corrected within 6 months. Similarly, if an ICF/MRchooses a reduction plan, all other minor deficiencies must be addressedas well.On the other hand, facilities having substantial deficiencies in areasother than physical plant and staffing (for example, active treatment),will not be eligible for correction or reduction plans regardless of whetherthey also have physical plant and staffing deficiencies. We reach thisconclusion because we believe that Congress made it clear that the focusof section 1919 of the Act is the correction of major physical plant orstaffing deficiencies or, failing that, the elimination of those beds thatare in the noncomplying part of the facility. As such, correction plansand reduction plans are designed to provide alternative solutions to thosefacilities that have only major physical plant and staffing deficiencies.Since the scope of reduction plans is unambiguously limited to physicalplant and staffing deficiencies, we believe that correction plans are similarlylimited.Although the statute refers to States as having the option to elect correctionand reduction plans offered by section 1919 of the Act, nothing in thestatute prohibits ICFs/MR from requesting Medicaid agencies to make applicationon their behalf. A Medicaid agency may permit an ICF/MR to do so, but theagency retains the right to concur with the ICF/MR's preference or not,and to convey its election to us in accordance with andSection; 442.114.While section 1919 of the Act does not specify requirements to be followedif a Medicaid agency failed to submit either a correction or reductionplan, we believe that the statute does not implicitly repeal other remediesavailable to us. Section 1919 provides remedies that are in addition to,and do not supersede, existing authorities. Should the Medicaid agencyelect not to submit either of these plans, we may cancel approval of thedeficient ICF/MR's participation in the Medicaid program in accordancewith section 1910(c) of the Act. Similarly, the Medicaid agency may preferto terminate the facility's provider agreement on its own. Likewise, ifwe find, as a result of a follow-up visit, complaint investigation, orother activity, that conditions at an ICF/MR have deteriorated while operatingunder an approved plan, we may terminate the ICF/MR's participation inaccordance with section 1910(c) of the Act. Also, if we find that conditionsexist that pose an immediate threat to the clients' health and safety,we must terminate the ICF/MR's participation in accordance with section1910(c) of the Act.The provisions of new andSection;andSection; 442.114 through 442.116 wouldapply only to correction and reduction plans that we approve within 3 yearsafter the effective date of final regulations. Medicaid agencies wouldbe able to continue implementation of permanent reduction plans approvedduring this 3-year period beyond the expiration date of our authority toapprove such plans, provided that the agencies continue to comply withthe terms and conditions of the approved plans. Our responsibility to monitorand enforce compliance by the agencies with the terms of the approved planswould not lapse with the expiration of our authority to approved new planapplications.D. Correction Plans: Specific Requirements (andSection; 442.115)<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Medicaid agency requirements (andSection; 442.115(a))</ITAG>We proposed to require that if a Medicaid agency chooses to submit a planof correction based on findings of substantial deficiencies only in physicalplant and staffing, the plan must include_andbullet; An explanation of the extent to which the ICF/MR currently complieswith the standards for ICFs/MR in 42 CFR Part 442, Subpart G, includingall other minor deficiencies identified during the direct Federal survey,andandbullet; A timetable for completing the necessary steps to correct allstaff and physical plant deficiencies, and all other minor deficiencies,within 6 months of the approval date of the plan. The statute providesno indication that a time period of greater than 6 months to correct deficiencies,other than staff and physical plant deficiencies, is intended. Thus, ifa Medicaid agency would choose to submit a correction plan, we believeit would be reasonable to expect the deficient ICF/MR to correct all deficiencieswithin 6 months of the approval date of the plan.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. HCFA Policies (andSection; 442.115(b))</ITAG>Upon receipt of a correction plan, we would review the correction planto ensure that the plan is feasible and would remedy all deficiencies timely.If we would question any aspect of the plan and the Medicaid agency's abilityto fulfill the requirements of the plan, we would communicate with theagency to try to resolve our concerns. We would forward in writing to theagency our approval or disapproval of the plan within 30 days of receiptof the proposed plan.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Termination of ICF/MR (andSection; 442.115(c))</ITAG>If the Medicaid agency submitted a correction plan that we found to beunacceptable, and after we unsuccessfully attempted to resolve our concernswith the agency, we would notify the agency of our disapproval and terminatethe ICF/MR's participation in the Medicaid program in accordance with section1910(c) of the Act.If, at the conclusion of the 6-month period specified in an approved planof correction, we determine that the agency has substantially failed tocorrect the deficiencies identified, we would terminate the ICF/MR's participationin the Medicaid program in accordance with section 1910(c) of the Act.We note that the Conference Report (H.R. Rep. No. 453, 99th Cong., 1stSess. 554 (1985)) indicates that Congress expects the Secretary to actpromptly to terminate an ICF/MR if the Medicaid agency fails to make thenecessary corrections within the 6-month period.E. Reduction Plans: Specific Requirements (andSection; 442.116)<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Conditions of Approval: State Requirements (andSection; 442.116(a))</ITAG>Before submitting a reduction plan based on findings of substantial deficienciesin physical plant and staffing, we would require a Medicaid agency to_andbullet; Outline the reduction plan and the process for submitting theplan and receiving public comments in a public hearing held at the affectedICF/MR at least 35 days before submitting the reduction plan;andbullet; Provide written notice of the hearing to staff, clients and theirparents or guardians at least 10 days prior to the hearing date;andbullet; Announce to advocacy and other interested groups and agencies,and the general community, through local media notices at least 10 daysprior to the hearing date_andbullet; The exact date, time and location of the hearing; andandbullet; The locations (that is, the affected ICF/MR, the State mentalretardation administration, State survey agency, State Development DisabilitiesCouncil, local protection and advocacy agencies and any other agenciesthat serve potentially interested parties (for example, State and localassociations for retarded citizens)) where the proposed plan is displayed.andbullet; Demonstrate that it has successfully provided home and communityservices similar to the services proposed to be provided under the reductionplan for similar individuals eligible for Medicaid; andandbullet; Provide us with assurances that the reduction plan would be completedby fulfilling the content requirement of the reduction plan.We interpret the statutory language of ``reasonable notice'' of the hearingas meaning written notice of the hearing to staff, clients and their parentsor guardians; and local media notices (for example, local newspaper announcements)to advocacy and other interested groups and agencies, and the general community.If, after the public hearing, an agency decides a reduction plan wouldnot be appropriate, the agency could follow the requirements for submittinga correction plan provided the plan is submitted within 30 days of receiptof the list of deficiencies.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Submittal Date of Plan (andSection; 442.116(c)) </ITAG>On the day that the Medicaid agency submits a reduction plan, the agencywould be required to announce through local media notices_ andbullet; That the plan has been submitted; andbullet; That the plan is on display at the affected ICF/MR, the Statemental retardation administration, State survey agency, State DevelopmentDisabilities Council, the local protection and advocacy agency and otheragencies that serve potentially interested parties (for example, Stateand local associations for retarded citizens); and andbullet; The address of the appropriate HCFA office for forwarding commentson the reduction plan and the closing date for receipt of those comments.We proposed to require the agency to meet these public notice provisionsbecause ICF/MR clients typically come from wide geographical areas, makingbroad notification necessary to ensure that all representatives of theclients are informed of the proposed impending changes. In addition, specialinterest groups and protection and advocacy agencies are not routinelyinformed of circumstances at an ICF/MR, yet have an important role in determining,as well as implementing, residential services and policies within the State.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Contents (andSection; 442.116(d)) </ITAG>We proposed to require a Medicaid agency to submit a reduction plan within65 days of receipt of the list of deficiencies that meets the followingcontent requirements. andbullet; Use of an interdisciplinary team approach to identify the numberof clients and their service needs on a client-by-client basis for homeor community services, and establish a timetable for providing these services,in 6-month intervals, within the 36-month period beginning on the datethat we approve the reduction plan. andbullet; Describe the methods used to_ andbullet; Select clients for home or community services, and andbullet; Develop alternative home and community services to effectivelymeet the clients' needs.andbullet; Describe the safeguards that will be applied to protect the clients'health and welfare while receiving home or community services, including_andbullet; Adequate standards for participation by clients, clients' familiesand providers; and andbullet; Assurances that the community residences in which the affectedclients are placed meet all applicable State and Federal licensure andcertification requirements. andbullet; Provide that clients who are eligible for Medicaid while in theICF/MR, at their (or their legal guardians') option, are placed in anothersetting (or another part of the affected ICF/MR) that is in full compliancewith Federal Medicaid requirements and allows them to retain their eligibility.If a client would have remained eligible for Medicaid regardless of whataction the Medicaid agency took concerning the deficient ICF/MR, then theagency may not, at any time, place the client involuntarily in a settingwhere he or she loses entitlement to Medicaid. The client would be ableto elect to be placed in a setting where he or she does not retain entitlementto Medicaid. If the client, or the client's guardian, voluntarily wouldchoose to move to a setting (for example, back home with his or her family)that causes the client's countable income or resources to exceed the Medicaidagency's eligibility standards, then the client's Medicaid eligibilitywould be subject to termination under the same terms and procedures thatapply to all Medicaid recipients. andbullet; Specify the actions to protect the health and safety of the clientsremaining in the ICF/MR while the reduction plan is in effect. An agencywould be prohibited from using the reduction plan option to delay makingneeded facility improvements for an additional 3 years. andbullet; Provide that the staff-to-client ratio at the ICF/MR will be thehigher of_ andbullet; The ratio described in the standards for ICFs and ICF/MR (andSection;442.445); or andbullet; The ratio which was in effect at the time the direct Federal surveywas conducted. andbullet; Provide for the protection of the staff affected by the reductionplan, including_ andbullet; Arrangements to preserve staff rights and benefits; andbullet; Training and retraining of staff where necessary; andbullet; Redeploying staff to community settings under the reduction plan;andandbullet; Making maximum efforts to secure employment (without necessarilyguaranteeing the employment of any staff). In the proposed rule, we stated that we would review carefully the experienceof the mentally retarded and developmentally disabled under the State'soverall community services program, including the Medicaid agency's relevanthome and community based services waivers, if any. The alternative homeand community based services need not be funded under a Medicaid home andcommunity based services waiver program. However, should a Medicaid agencywish to utilize the waiver program to fund these services, all provisionsof the statute and regulations applicable to that program must be met andwe must approve the proposal prior to granting Medicaid waiver funding.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. HCFA Policies (andSection;442.116(e)) </ITAG>We proposed to consider reduction plans submitted on a first come, firstserved basis. Medicaid agencies would submit reduction plans within 65days of receipt of the list of deficiencies that would be identified througha direct Federal survey. We would provide the public at least 30 days afterthe Medicaid agency submits a reduction plan to comment on the proposedplan. We would review the proposed plan to assure that the plan is wellconceived; that it has had the benefit of client and family, staff andpublic input; and that the quality of life for both the clients remainingin the ICF/MR and those receiving community placements is adequately protected.If we would question any aspect of the plan and the agency's ability tofulfill the requirements of the plan, we would communicate with the agencyto try to resolve our concerns. After we have carefully considered allpublic comments received by the close of the comment period, we would respondin writing to the agency within 60 days of receipt of the plan. We wouldalso take care to assure that approved reduction plans do not lead to the``dumping'' of affected clients into substandard settings. While the statute allows a Medicaid agency a maximum of 36 months to reducethe number of beds in certified units, we believe that there could be situationsin which it would be appropriate to limit the amount of time to implementa reduction plan. For example, a facility with 200 beds seeking to eliminate50 beds would probably not need a full 36 months to implement its reductionplan. Under our authority to approve a plan, we believe we may limit thetime provisions proposed in a plan, as a condition of approval, to avoidsituations in which Medicaid agencies attempt to use the maximum allowabletime period to delay making the necessary improvements in a timely manner.We would negotiate timeframes on a case-by-case basis. In accordance with section 1919(d)(2) of the Act, if we would approve morethan 15 reduction plans in any fiscal year, any reduction plans approvedafter the first 15 approved plans, could be only for an ICF/MR (or distinctpart thereof) for which the costs of correcting the substantial deficienciesare $2 million or greater (as would be demonstrated by the agency to oursatisfaction). After we have approved 15 reduction plans in any fiscalyear, we would indicate in our transmittal to all subsequent Medicaid agenciesfound to have ICFs/MR with substantial deficiencies that they must demonstratethat the costs of correcting the substantial deficiencies would equal $2million or more. Medicaid agencies could demonstrate costs of $2 millionor more by providing evidence of contractor estimates of renovations, costallocation reports for increasing staff, and any other evidence that supportsthe costs of correcting the cited deficiencies. There would be no limiton the number of qualified plans that we could approve where the costsof correction are equal to or greater than $2 million. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Termination of an ICF/MR (andSection;442.116(f)) </ITAG>If the Medicaid agency submits a reduction plan that we found to be unacceptable,and after we have unsuccessfully attempted to resolve our concerns withthe agency, we would notify the agency of our disapproval. We would considerterminating the ICF/MR's participation in the Medicaid program in accordancewith section 1910(c) of the Act. If, at the conclusion of the initial 6-month period or any 6-month intervalthereafter of an approved reduction plan, we determined that the Medicaidagency substantially failed to meet the requirements of the reduction plan,we would_ andbullet; Terminate the ICF/MR from participating in the Medicaid programin accordance with section 1910(c) of the Act, or andbullet; Disallow FFP equal to 5 percent of the cost of care for all eligibleclients for each month for which the agency failed to meet the requirementsdespite good faith efforts it might have made.D. Technical AmendmentsTo allow for placement in 42 CFR Part 442 of the regulation provisionsproposed by these regulations, we proposed to redesignate andSection;andSection;442.110 through 442.115 as andSection;andSection; 442.109 through 442.113,respectively.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Analysis Of and Responses To Public Comments</ITAG>In developing this final regulation, we considered the 19 items of correspondencethat were received within the prescribed comment period from State Medicaidagencies, professional organizations, Medicaid providers, and interestedindividuals. The major comments and our responses to those comments arediscussed below.General Provisions<T3>Comment:</T3> Two commenters believe that Congress intended that regulationsimplementing the provisions of section 1919 of the Act be effective asof April 7, 1986 (the date of enactment of (COBRA)). The commenters believethat had Congress wished to delay implementation of section 1919 of theAct pending the release of final rules, they would have established aneffective date later than the date of enactment (April 7, 1986).<T3>Response:</T3> Since the publication of the proposed rule, Congressenacted the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-203).Section 4217(b) of Pub. L. 100-203 specifies that the regulations promulgatedunder section 1919 of Pub. L. 99-272 shall be effective as if promulgatedon the date of enactment of Pub. L. 99-272 (that is, April 7, 1986). Therefore,these final regulations are effective as of April 7, 1986.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter understood that the options of deficientfacilities to submit correction or reduction plans were available onlyto facilities found deficient as a result of an <T3>initial </T3>look-behind survey.<T3>Response:</T3> These options are not limited to initial look-behindsurveys. The option to submit a reduction plan will also be extended bythe State to a facility that fails to meet standards on a resurvey.<T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters requested changes that would requirelegislative changes. The commenters requested that_andbullet; HCFA permit a State Medicaid agency to submit a correction planthat has an implementation period of longer than 6 months when the improvementsare subject to special legislative authorization (for example, increasedstaffing authorization) or capital construction.andbullet; HCFA initiate punitive action for failure to meet correction andreduction plans only after an ICF/MR fails to act within a timeframe thatis longer than a 6-month interval.andbullet; HCFA allow an additional 6 months (a total of 12 months) for remedyingmajor physical plant deficiencies that are specified in an approved planof correction.andbullet; The process relating to State requirements for approval of reductionplans is rather cumbersome. This may act as a deterrent to prevent someStates from choosing to submit a reduction plan instead of a correctionplan for the affected ICF/MR.<T3>Response:</T3> The recommendations made by these comments extend beyondthe provisions of the statute, and we cannot implement changes that exceedour statutory authority.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter stated that throughout the proposed rulethere appeared to be an underlying attempt to reduce the size of largeICFs/MR and a stated <T3>expectancy</T3> that ``generally, [HCFA] would find an ICF/MR to havesubstantial deficiencies as a result of a validation survey.'' The commenterrequested that we explain the basis for this expectancy. <T3>Response: </T3>As stated in the regulatory flexibility analysis forthe proposed regulation, it is clear that the reduction plan option maynot be appropriate for smaller facilities found to have substantial deficienciesin physical plant and staffing. States would be more likely to elect thereduction plan for large ICFs/MR with substantial deficiencies. The statementthat we would find an ICF/MR to have substantial deficiencies as a resultof a validation survey is based on the fact that when we initiate mostFederal adverse actions against ICFs/MR, we base them on onsite Federalsurveys, though only about 15 percent of all validation surveys resultin the threat of an adverse action.Terms (andSection; 442.2)<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters stated that we should define ``substantiallyfailed to meet requirements'' and asked why good-faith efforts are notconsidered substantial compliance if the facility is unable to correctall of the deficiencies in the required time period.<T3>Response: </T3>We have not defined the phrase ``substantially failedto meet requirements'' because we recognize that, with the wide diversityof facilities and clients served, it is not possible to define in a fairand accurate way criteria for making this determination. Rather, we willrely on the Federal surveyors' findings and recommendations to our regionaloffice officials, who have the delegated authority to make determinations,as an effective way of both enforcing Federal rules and providing facilitieswith the benefit of a flexible enforcement system. Providing for a flexibleenforcement system will enable us, if at all possible, to respond to localcircumstances without resorting to adverse actions. If detailed criteriawere established, regional offices would not be able to consider any extenuatingcircumstances in a determination decision except the failure of the facilityto meet the pre-set criteria for ``substantial failure to meet requirements.''We also recognize that any adverse action we do not take must withstandthe scrutiny of the appeals process. Thus, we will not take adverse actionsbased on substantial non-compliance unless we are convinced that the ICF/MRis functioning so poorly on behalf of its clients that it should not receiveFederal payments.``Good faith efforts'' will not be considered under the correction planoption because the result of such efforts may still result in non-compliancewith Federal requirements. Either the State substantially meets its approvedcorrection plan for an ICF/MR or we will initiate termination actions.In the case of reduction plans that are not being met, the Secretary hasthe option to terminate the ICF/MR's provider agreement or to disallowstatutorily-prescribed amounts of FFP.Correction and Reduction Plans: General Provisions (andSection;442.114)<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter argues that ICFs/MR do not need to be validatedby another set of standards or regulations. The commenter interpreted theregulations as suggesting that validation surveys would only be directedat large ICFs/MR and that we would impose reduction plans.<T3>Response: </T3>The statute does not require ICFs/MR to be surveyedunder a new set of standards. The existing standards set forth in 42 CFRPart 442, Subpart G, are used for validation (direct Federal) surveys.A reduction plan will not be imposed on a facility. Both the correctionand reduction plans are two additional <T3>options </T3>available to a State when an ICF/MR has substantial deficienciesonly in physical plant and staffing and other remaining minor deficienciesthat do not pose an immediate threat to clients' health and safety arefound during a direct Federal survey.<T3>Comment: </T3>Commenters requested that we clarify how the proposedregulations would affect the current regulations, especially in relationto andSection;442.113(b), which allows 12 months for correction of citeddeficiencies. Some commenters believe that the proposed rules are not sufficientlyexplicit regarding the applicability of the additional options to ICFs/MR.<T3>Response</T3>: Current regulations (andSection;andSection; 442.105 through442.111 and 442.113) are not related to the implementation of section 1919of the Act, because they regulate only the actions of the State surveyagencies and not those of the Secretary that are discretely authorizedby section 1919. If a facility is notified of substantial deficienciesin physical plant and staffing and the State fails to choose either optionprovided by the statute, we will exercise our authority under section 1910(c)of the Act by notifying the facility that its participation in the Medicaidprogram may be terminated.<T3>Comment</T3>: One commenter requested that we require that ``substantialdeficiencies'' be submitted for review and approval by a panel of expertswho have no interest in, or relationship with either HCFA, the State Medicaidagency, or the ICF/MR under review.<T3>Response</T3>: Section 1910(c) of the Act grants us the authority tomake a determination that a facility failed to meet the requirements forparticipation in the Medicaid program. Section 1919 of the Act providesno authority for the type of review suggested by the commenter.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested clarification of the option to``reduce permanently the number of beds in certified units'' within 36months of the approval date of the plan, to determine if it pertains toall certified beds Statewide, or exclusively to a developmental center,or only to a single facility.<T3>Response</T3>: The regulation refers only to the number of beds inthe specific ICF/MR that will be operating under a reduction plan and doesnot pertain to all certified beds Statewide.<T3>Comment</T3>: One commenter requested that, in addition to the rightof an ICF/MR whose participation has been terminated from the Medicaidprogram to appeal the action under 1910(c)(2) of the Act, we allow clients,their parents and guardians, or interested organizations to initiate evidentiaryhearings and legal proceedings to the same extent as provided in section1910(c)(2) of the Act.<T3>Response</T3>: Section 1910(c)(2) of the Act is very specific aboutthe rights of a facility to appeal a determination to terminate the facilityfrom Medicaid participation. The statute does not permit other partiesto initiate evidentiary hearings and other proceedings under section 1910(c)(2)of the Act, and we have no other authority to do so.<T3>Comment</T3>: Several commenters requested that the time frames forsubmitting correction plans and reduction plans be extended to allow moretime for the preparation of such plans that is, approvals and resourcecommitments. It was also noted that there is virtually no time if, afterthe hearing, the State decides the reduction plan would not be appropriateand opts to submit a correction plan, given the 30-day deadline for submittingcorrection plans.<T3>Response</T3>: We believe the time frames are adequate with the exceptionnoted below. The provisions of the statute and this regulation are availableto a facility operating with deficiencies in physical plant and staffingof such a substantial nature that the facility faces potential terminationfrom the Medicaid program. Under conditions that pose potential harm toprogram beneficiaries, we believe it would be most unwise to delay correctiveaction by extending the time frames. Moreover, the statute links the timeframe for submission of a reduction plan <T3>directly</T3> to the time frame for correction plans, and we believethat 30 days is the most time we should allow a facility with serious deficienciesto submit a correction plan. The provisions of the statute dictate thata reduction plan be submitted within 65 days of a notice of deficienciesbecause of the additional 35 days that must be added to the correctionplan time frame set by the Secretary. Thus, we have no statutory flexibilityto alter the reduction plan time frames independent of the correction plantime frames. In our experience, when a facility is facing the loss of Federalfunds as a result of termination actions, facilities have been able tolocate needed resources to avoid termination.After considering the comment that under the proposed rule (51 FR 26721)little, if any, time, is available if, as a result of the public hearing,a State decides that a reduction plan is not appropriate and chooses tosubmit a correction plan, we have revised andSection; 442.115(c) to permita State to submit a proposed correction plan to us within 20 days fromthe date of the public hearing. We will apply this additional time frameonly when a State decides to submit a correction plan after it has conducteda public hearing to announce a reduction plan and the State decides thereduction plan is not appropriate. Otherwise, the time frames remain unchanged.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested the public comment period beextended to 90 days instead of the proposed 30 days.<T3>Response</T3>: We believe that 30 days is adequate time for the publicto formally submit comments to us. The public will have had an opportunityto review the proposed plan (before the formal 30-day comment period begins)at the time of the public hearing. We believe that extending the publiccomment period beyond 30 days would unnecessarily delay action to correctthe serious deficiencies at the affected facility.<T3>Correction Plans:</T3> Specific Requirements (andSection; 442.115) Terminationof an ICF/MR (andSection; 442.115(c))<T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters stated that the proposed rule doesnot address any timetable for determining how long the process can lastif HCFA does not accept an agency's plan of correction.<T3>Response:</T3> In order to make our original intent clear that we willnot delay the process of making a final determination on submitted correctionplans beyond the specified 30-day review period, we have revised andSection;442.115(c)(1). Section 442.115(c)(1) of the proposed rule could be interpretedto mean that we could delay approval or disapproval of a correction planuntil after we attempt to resolve our concerns with the agency. It is notour intention to delay our response to the agency beyond the specified30-day period from the date the agency submits a correction plan. Becauseof the serious nature of the deficiencies that these regulations address,we must avoid delaying action to correct the deficiencies. However, wewill do everything possible to assist States in the preparation of a planprior to the submission of the plan. As we stated in the preamble to theproposed rule (51 FR 26721), if we question any aspect of a submitted planor the Medicaid agency's ability to fulfill the requirements of the plan,we will try to resolve our concerns with the agency. However, we will notdelay our determination to approve or disapprove a correction plan. Wewill forward our written approval or disapproval of the plan to the agencywithin 30 days of receipt of a proposed plan. If we do not accept an agency'splan of correction, we will exercise our authority under section 1910(c)of the Act to terminate the deficient ICF/MR's participation in the Medicaidprogram at the same time we notify the State that the plan of correctionis not accepted.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter was concerned that there does not appearto be any appeals process open to the States in cases of dispute.<T3>Response:</T3> The statute does not provide for an appeals processif the plan of correction is not approved. However, if the facility's participationin Medicaid is terminated, the usual appeals procedures are available tothe ICF/MR. If we terminate an ICF/MR's participation under section 1910(c)of the Act, the ICF/MR may file an appeal with the Office of Hearings andAppeals through the HCFA regional office. At the time that we notify anICF/MR of our decision to terminate, we provide the ICF/MR with instructionsfor filing an appeal.<T3>Reduction Plans:</T3> Specific Requirements (andSection; 442.116)<T3>Conditions of Approval:</T3> State Requirements (andSection; 442.116(a))<T3>Comment:</T3> While one Medicaid agency strongly supported the holdingof a public hearing, the agency requested that the final regulations reflecta simple hearings process and related activities that are easily accomplishedgiven the brief time frame allowed for completion.<T3>Response:</T3> We believe that we have outlined a hearings processthat is uncomplicated and can easily be accomplished in the allowable timeframe. The commenter did not suggest any specific recommendations for usto consider.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested that we require States to developapproved guidelines for evaluation of all Medicaid eligible providers;establish limitations of their ability to discharge or transfer clients;and develop on behalf of the Medicaid recipients an independent due processprocedure in problematic cases.<T3>Response:</T3> In accordance with 42 CFR Part 442, Subpart G, we prescribestandards for ICF services in ICFs/MR, including standards for the releaseand transfer of clients at the ICF/MR (andSection;andSection; 442.424 and 442.425).There is no prohibition to the establishment of an independent due processprocedure in problematic cases if the State Medicaid agency wishes to doso, but we do not believe it is necessary to impose such a procedure onthe States by regulation.<T3>Comment:</T3> In order to ensure that a State does not simply createanother institution ``with just a new name'' when it elects to implementa reduction plan, one commenter believes that group homes or other facilitiesshould house between six to ten individuals with direct supervision orhouse eight individuals with minimal supervision.<T3>Response:</T3> We have no authority to specify the maximum number ofclients living in an ICF/MR defined as ``small,'' especially if the facilityis not certified.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter requested written notice of the State Medicaidagency's reduction plan to include the nearest family members of the retardedperson since many parents of mentally retarded adults are sometimes deceasedor too infirm to respond.<T3>Response:</T3> We have accepted this recommendation and have revisedandSection; 442.116(a)(2) to request the participation of the party or familymember nearest to, or most interested or involved with the client.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter believes that the written notice shouldbe mailed ``Return Receipt Requested'' in order to ensure that the agencygives sufficient notification time to interested parties.     <T3>Response:</T3> We do not believe it is necessary to interpret the statutorylanguage of ``reasonable notice'' of the hearing to mean more than writtennotice of the hearing. We accept written notice and local media noticesas sufficient notification under other requirements of the Medicaid programand we have not experienced any problems in these other areas. However,States could choose to mail notices of hearings ``Return Receipt Requested''.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested that ``written notice'' of apublic hearing on a proposed reduction plan should not be interpreted asrequiring individual notice to staff and clients of the affected ICF/MR.<T3>Response:</T3> We believe that clients or their parents, legal guardiansand/or interested parties require individual written notice. An ICF/MRmay choose not to give individual written notice to facility staff if theICF/MR provides written notice through established channels of communicationwithin the ICF/MR. That is, the ICF/MR may notify facility staff throughroutine written memoranda to all facility staff, posted notices in areasfrequented by all staff, or through other methods commonly used at theICF/MR. We will further delineate the requirements of written notice inour instructions to the States.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter thought that advocacy and volunteer organizationsdirectly associated with the ICF/MR and the relevant courts should be addedto the list of community organizations and institutions to be notifiedof the reduction plan.<T3>Response:</T3> Section 442.116(a)(3) specifies that advocacy groupsand other interested groups and agencies be notified and we believe thatvolunteer organizations are adequately represented as part of these groups.However, we will add to andSection; 442.116(a)(3) ``the courts with whichthe ICF/MR is involved in litigation (if any) arising out of its Medicaidparticipation'' as part of the groups to be notified of the hearing.<T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters suggested that we increase the timeperiod for providing written notice of the hearing to assure involvementof all interested parties.<T3>Response:</T3> We believe that the requirement for an agency to forwardwritten notice of the hearing at least ten days prior to the hearing providesadequate notice. Again, we do not want to unnecessarily delay taking actionsagainst a facility that is found to have substantial deficiencies.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter requested that we provide for review ofthe proposed reduction plan by qualified consumer representatives and aselected team of disinterested experts.<T3>Response:</T3> We agree, and the regulations (andSection; 442.116(a)(3))allow all interested parties, including consumer representatives and disinterestedexperts, the opportunity to review the plan. The regulations require publicnotice of the locations where the plan is displayed for review. Moreover,andSection; 442.116(e)(1) provides interested parties the opportunity tocomment on the plan.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested that the requirement for proposedreduction plans be placed on display at ``any other agencies that servepotentially interested parties'' is overly broad and vague and thereforeunduly burdensome on States.<T3>Response:</T3> We have accepted this comment because we recognize thatthe word ``any'' could mean ``all''. We have revised andSection;andSection;442.116 (a)(3)(ii) and (c)(2) to require that proposed reduction plansbe displayed at other agencies, which in the State's judgment, serve potentiallyinterested parties.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested that we provide for sufficientcopies of the plan to be reproduced and made available on request to allmembers of the public who have a reasonable interest in these proceedings.<T3>Response: </T3>We believe that display of the plan at various locationsprovides an acceptable method of meeting the intent of the law. However,the option to provide copies of the plan is available to the agencies displayingthe plan. Contents (andSection; 442.116(d))<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters expressed confusion over the intentof proposed andSection; 442.116(d)(4), as required by section 1919(c)(4)of the Act, and stated that our translation of the law is beyond the intentof the statute, though the commenters did not state how. One commenterrecommended that the preamble language about involuntary transfers be substitutedfor the language currently in proposed andSection; 442.116(d)(4). Anothercommenter requested that we revise andSection; 442.116(d)(4) to require thatthe provision of home and community services be ``comparable'' to the servicesproposed instead of services being ``similar'' to the services proposed.<T3>Response: </T3>We believe the preamble language describes accuratelythe provisions of the statute in section 1919(c)(4) of the Act and theregulation corresponds to the intent of the law. However, in order to ensurethat there is no confusion, we have revised andSection; 442.116(d)(4) toreflect exactly the language of section 1919(c)(4). <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter stated that is appears that taking a developmentallydisabled person back into the family home would penalize the family bythe loss of benefits. The commenter believes that making a distinctionbetween voluntary and involuntary placement in the home is subject to manipulationby the State. The commenter stated that the alternatives offered the clientmay be inhumane or otherwise unacceptable. The commenter suggested thatwe encourage the development of extended family ties rather than discouragethem.<T3>Response: </T3>The law states that a reduction plan must not impairthe Medicaid eligibility of affected clients without their consent. Ifthe client would have remained eligible for Medicaid regardless of whataction the Medicaid agency took concerning the deficient ICF/MR, then theagency may not, at any time, involuntarily place the client where he orshe loses entitlement to Medicaid. The client, however, may elect to beplaced in a setting where he or she does not retain entitlement to Medicaid.For example, the client may choose to move back home with his or her family,thus causing the client's countable income or resources to exceed the Medicaidagency's eligibility standards, so the client's Medicaid eligibility wouldbe subject to termination under the same terms and procedures that applyto all Medicaid recipients.The reduction plan imposes a number of requirements on States to assurethat any plan to reduce is well conceived; that it has had the benefitof client, family, staff, and public input; and that the quality of lifefor both the clients remaining in the facility and those receiving communityplacements is adequately protected. The intention of these requirementsis to assure that approved reduction plans do not lead to the ``dumping''of affected clients into substandard settings.HCFA Policies (andSection; 442.116(e))<T3>Comment: </T3>Commenters would like clarification of the 30-day publiccomment period provided by HCFA when there has been an opportunity forpublic comment at the State level. One commenter suggested extending the30-day public comment period to 90 days. Commenters requested that we explainour process for handling public comments that we receive and the impactof the comments on our approval of reduction plans. <T3>Response: </T3>We will allow a comment period providing interestedclients, family, staff, and members of the public the opportunity to commentdirectly to us on a State's proposal. We believe the 30-day time framefor receiving public comments allows adequate time for individuals andorganizations to respond to the proposed plan. We will give careful considerationto these comments in connection with our decision to approve or disapprovethe proposed plan. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter stated that the example used in the preambleto illustrate situations in which it would be appropriate to limit theamount of time to implement a reduction plan was ``dubious''.<T3>Response: </T3>We acknowledge that many factors influence the decisionto grant an amount of time for the implementation of the reduction plan.We used a simple example for illustrative purposes only. <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters argued that HCFA has no monitoringauthority outside of the ICF/MR program. If clients choose to be placedin a non-ICF/MR setting as part of the reduction plan, HCFA will be unableto monitor that placement and, therefore, compliance with this standard.<T3>Response: </T3>We have no authority to monitor non-certified facilitiesand other non-participating settings into which clients may be placed.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter believes that the usefulness of a reductionplan for an ICF/MR that has staff deficiencies is unclear. Proposed andSection;442.116(d)(6) requires staffing consistent with current ICF/MR standards(andSection; 442.445). The commenter questioned whether the facility mustmeet all ICF/MR staff requirements, or whether compliance with residentliving staff, and staffing for other functions, (for example, habilitation,nutrition, nursing, medical) is sufficient to guarantee resident healthand safety.<T3>Response:</T3> Clients must still receive active treatment, which meansthe facility must provide adequate staff to provide needed care and servicesin safe and healthful environments. <T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters requested clarification concerningwhen termination would occur if we disapprove a State's reduction plan.Commenters questioned whether or not negotiations could occur before terminatinga facility. <T3>Response:</T3> If we do not accept a State's reduction plan, we willexercise our authority under section 1910(c) of the Act to terminate thedeficient ICF/MR's participation in the Medicaid program at the same timewe notify the State that the reduction plan is not accepted. In order tomake our original intent clear that we will not delay the process of makinga final determination on submitted reduction plans beyond the specified60-day period (that allows for the statutorily mandated 30-day public commentperiod) from receipt of a plan, we have revised andSection; 442.116(f)(1).Section 442.116(f)(1) of the proposed rule could be interpreted to meanthat we could delay approval or disapproval of a reduction plan until afterwe attempt to resolve our concerns with the agency. It is not our intentionto delay our response to the agency beyond the specified 60-day periodfrom the date the agency submits a reduction plan. Because of the seriousnature of the deficiencies that these regulations address, we must avoiddelaying action to remedy the deficiencies. However, we will do everythingpossible to assist States in the preparation of a plan prior to the submissionof the plan. As we stated in the preamble to the proposed rule (51 FR 26722),if we question any aspect of a submitted plan or the Medicaid agency'sability to fulfill the requirements of the plan, we will try to resolveour concerns with the agency. However, we will not delay our determinationto approve or disapprove a reduction plan. We will forward in writing tothe agency within 60 days of receipt of a proposed plan our approval ordisapproval of the plan. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter contends it is unclear what conditionswould trigger either termination of the ICF/MR or disallowance of FFP,if any six-month interval time frame for reduction is not met. <T3>Response:</T3> If, after any six-month period, we determine that aState failed to meet the reduction plan provisions of andSection; 442.116,and we determine the State has not made a good faith effort to meet thoserequirements, we will initiate termination procedures. If we determinefailure to comply with the requirements resulted despite the State's bestefforts, we will apply a five-percent FFP disallowance penalty. If substantial noncompliance with the reduction plan requirements continuesto be found, or if conditions worsen irrespective of ``good faith efforts'',the statute gives us the<T3> option</T3> of terminating the facility's participation. It is ourpolicy to terminate the facility's participation in such cases. (Good faithefforts apply only to the reduction plan. In the case of the correctionplan, we will make a substantial compliance or noncompliance determinationbased on actual conditions in the facility and not based on the ``goodfaith efforts'' of the provider.) <T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters emphasized the importance of ensuringthat a reduction plan meet all the health care service delivery needs andactive treatment requirements of the clients selected for community placement.<T3>Response:</T3> The provisions of the statute are explicit about thespecific requirements of a reduction plan and we have included those requirementsin andSection; 442.116. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter believes that aside from his or her family,guardian and friends, a retarded person's best safeguard for ensuring thedelivery of services is access to legal services. The commenter suggestedthat we provide money through the Legal Services Corporation for legalrepresentation (including consultant fees) for retarded people and theirfamilies and guardians who advocate on their behalf. <T3>Response:</T3> We have no statutory authority to provide for the financingof legal services for clients or their families and guardians. Protectionand advocacy agencies funded under the Developmental Disabilities Act havethe authority to provide legal assistance in matters of this type. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter stated that many mentally retarded clientsleaving long term care facilities will need assistance from numerous health,educational, and human service agencies in the public and private sectors.The commenter stated that many will have multiple handicaps and suggestedthat a task force be established to coordinate the various services neededby these individuals upon re-entry into the community. <T3>Response:</T3> There is no statutory authority for us to establishsuch a task force. States, however, may choose to form such task forces.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Summary of Changes in the Final Regulations</ITAG>As stated in our discussion of the comments and responses, we have madesome changes to the approach we had proposed in the regulations publishedon July 25, 1986. With the exception of the changes identified below, thefinal regulations reflect the proposals made in the July 25, 1986 proposedrule.Medicaid Agency Options (andSection; 442.114 (a) and (b))We have clarified that correction and reduction plans will be availableto States that have ICFs/MR found to have substantial deficiencies <T3>only</T3> in physical plant and staffing (or physical plant, staffing,and other <T3>minor</T3> deficiencies) that do not pose an immediate threat to theclients' health and safety.Effective Date (andSection; 442.114(d))Since the publication of the proposed rule, Congress enacted the OmnibusBudget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-203). Section 4217(b) ofPub. L. 100-203 specifies that the regulations promulgated under section1919 of Pub. L. 99-272 shall be effective as if promulgated on the dateof enactment of Pub. L. 99-272 (that is, April 7, 1986). Therefore, thesefinal regulations are effective for any Federal survey of an ICF/MR initiatedon or after April 7, 1986 in which substantial deficiencies in physicalplant and staffing that did not pose an immediate threat to the clients'health and safety were found.Correction Plans for ICFs/MR: Specific Requirements (andSection; 442.115)We have revised andSection; 442.115 by adding an exception to our policyfor receiving proposed correction plans (andSection; 442.115(c)). If a Statechooses to submit a reduction plan and after conducting a public hearingdecides that a reduction plan is not appropriate, the State may submitto us a correction plan within 20 days from the date of the public hearing.Under these circumstances, we must receive the correction plan within 20days from the date of the public hearing. We will advise States that ifthey choose to submit a reduction plan, they may wish to consider preparinga preliminary correction plan at the same time so that if, as a resultof the public hearing, they decide to submit a correction plan, they willhave already begun preparing it.In order to make our original intent clear that we will not delay the processof making a final determination on submitted correction plans beyond our30-day review period, we have revised andSection; 442.115(d)(1). Section442.115(d)(1) of the proposed rule could be interpreted to mean that wecould delay approval or disapproval of a correction plan until after weattempt to resolve our concerns with the agency. We have revised andSection;442.115(d)(1) to clarify that we will not delay our response to an agencybeyond the specified 30-day period from the date the agency submits a correctionplan.Reduction Plans for ICFs/MR: Specific Requirements (andSection; 442.116)andbullet; We have revised andSection; 442.116(a)(2) to require that the ``nearest,most interested, or involved family member or party'' receive written noticeof a State Medicaid agency's reduction plan.andbullet; We have revised andSection; 442.116(a)(3) to include ``the courtswith which the ICF/MR is involved in litigation (if any) arising out ofits Medicaid participation'' as one of the groups to be notified of thepublic hearing.andbullet; We have revised andSection; 442.116 (a)(3)(ii) and (c)(2) to requirethat proposed reduction plans be displayed at other agencies, which inthe State's judgment, serve potentially interested parties.andbullet; We have removed from andSection;andSection; 442.116 (a)(3)(ii) and(c)(2) the word ``any'' so that the regulations cannot be interpreted tomean that a proposed reduction plan must be displayed at <T3>all</T3> advocacy agencies and other agencies that serve potentiallyinterested parties.andbullet; To clarify andSection; 442.116(d)(4), we have revised that sectionto reflect the statutory language concerning retaining clients' Medicaideligibility.andbullet; We have added to the regulations the provision that we may approvereduction plans for a shorter period than 36 months, where appropriate(andSection; 442.116(e)(3)).andbullet; We have added a requirement to the regulations that clarifiesthat HCFA approval of a reduction plan does not constitute approval ofany request for a home and community-based waiver (andSection; 442.116(e)(4)).Home and community based waiver requests are subject to a separate HCFAreview and approval process under 42 CFR 441.300. Disapproval of a requestfor a home and community-based waiver constitutes disapproval of a requestfor a reduction plan that is dependent upon approval of the request fora home and community-based waiver. ICFs/MR that submit reduction plansthat are dependent upon receipt of HCFA approval of home and community-basedwaiver requests may choose to develop contingency plans to avoid disruptionsin the event that HCFA denies a waiver request.andbullet; In order to make our original intent clear that we will not delaythe process of making a final determination on submitted reduction plansbeyond the 60-day period from receipt of a plan, we have revised andSection;442.116(f)(1). Section 442.116(f)(1) of the proposed rule could be interpretedto mean that we could delay approval or disapproval of a reduction planuntil after we attempt to resolve our concerns with the agency. We haverevised andSection; 442.116(f)(1) to clarify that we will not delay our responseto an agency beyond the specified 60-day period from the date the agencysubmits a reduction plan.CorrectionsWe have made some minor changes to the final regulations to correct typographicalerrors that appeared in the proposed rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Regulatory Impact Statement</ITAG>A. Executive Order 12291Executive Order 12291 requires us to prepare and publish a regulatory impactanalysis for any final regulations that are likely to meet criteria fora ``major rule''. A major rule is one that would result in:  (1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;  (2) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or any geographic regions;or   (3) Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.  The economic impact of this regulation will not exceed $100 million ormeet the other thresholds specified in the Executive Order. Therefore,we have not prepared a regulatory impact analysis.B. Regulatory Flexibility Act  Consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601-612),we prepared and publish a regulatory flexibility analysis for regulationsunless the Secretary certifies that the regulations will not have a significantimpact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA,we consider all ICFs/MR to be small entities. Since these regulations potentiallycould have a signficiant impact on a substantial number of ICFs/MR, weprepared an initial regulatory flexibility analysis for the proposed rulepublished July 25, 1986. The following discussion constitutes our finalregulatory flexibility analysis.   There are 3,340 Medicaid-participating ICFs/MR nationwide. We cannot determineexactly how many ICFs/MR might be affected by the provisions of these regulations. Generally, we make our own determination of ICF/MR compliance with pertinentFederal requirements as a result of a validation survey. For FY 1987, weplan to perform 459 validation surveys of ICFs/MR. A direct Federal surveymight also be performed as the result of a complaint or other circumstances,but such surveys are conducted in response to immediate problems, ratherthan as part of a planned process.  The requirements for correction and reduction plans will apply to all ICFs/MR,large and small, State or other government operated, private, nonprofit,or for-profit. However, it is clear that the reduction plan option maynot always be appropriate for smaller facilities. States will be more likelyto elect the reduction plan for large ICFs/MR with substantial deficiencies.Many large facilities are State-owned. Whether large or small, a State-ownedICF/MR that came under these requirements could have difficulties, withinthe constraints of a State's budget and appropriations process, in complyingwith the 6-month time limit of the correction plan option.Because we are unable to predict the decisions States will make when giventhe options provided by this regulation, we are unable to quantify thepotential effect it will have. Section 9516(c) of Pub. L. 99-272 requiresthat the Secretary report to Congress on the implementation and resultsof the correction and reduction plans approved by the Secretary. We expectto assess the effects on terminations, deficiences, and clients throughthe monitoring activities necessary for the completion of that report.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Waiver of 30-Day Delay of Effective Date</ITAG>We usually publish our rules not less than 30 days before their effectivedates unless we find good cause and publish that rationale with the rule.Since section 4217(b) of Pub. L. 100-203 specifies that the regulationspromulgated under section 1919 of Pub. L. 99-272 shall be effective asif promulgated on the date of enactment of Pub. L. 99-272 (that is, April7, 1986), we find good cause to waive the 30-day delay of the effectivedate for these final regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980</ITAG>(Pub. L. 96-511)Sections 442.114(a), 442.115(a), and 442.116 (a) and (d) of this finalrule contain information collection requirements that are subject to reviewby the Executive Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork ReductionAct of 1980.
