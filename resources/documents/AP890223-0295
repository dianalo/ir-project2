Phil Gramm said Thursday.   Gramm said FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman plans to establish``an orderly process'' for disposing of billions of dollars inassets from failed savings and loans in Texas so the state'seconomic recovery is not disrupted.   Those assets _ including office buildings, hotels, motels,apartments, single family homes and shopping centers _ will not besold at ``firesale prices,'' the Texas Republican said after meetingwith Seidman.   Seidman plans to announce the effort in Texas after Congresspasses President Bush's proposal to bail out the savings and loanindustry.   Gramm said dumping the assets on the Texas market at rock bottomprices would send real estate prices in the state plummeting.   Flooding the market would have a ``cataclysmic impact on banksand savings and loans that are not insolvent, stop allconstruction'' and set the state's recovery back three or four years.   Sen. Timothy Worth, D-Colo., said $7.5 billion in assets fromfailed thrifts are currently being held by the Federal Savings andLoan Insurance Corp. A large part of that portfolio is held in Texas.   Under Bush's proposed plan to restructure the thrift regulatorysystem, the FDIC would have responsibility for insuring bothcommercial banks and savings and loans. FSLIC would be merged intothe FDIC, giving the FDIC responsiblity for the repossessed assets.</TEXT></DOC>
