To meet the needsof the advanced information society in the future, the company has nowdeveloped an integrated control system of power distribution and informationwith the purpose of automatizing customer service works. In 1987, 250houses in Higashi-ku, Fukuoka City were chosen to be demonstration modelsof the system. An optical fiber cable was led to each house to put emphasison information services of customers. The plastic fiber cable that isused for light transmission causes a lot of loss on transmission, buton the other hand it is strong against bending and tension and easy ofjoint work besides being cheap. The special feature of this system isthat channels are set up according to purposes; those directly connectedwith power supply and those of customer services. Further researchesare being conducted to construct an integrated automatization systemof power distribution which includes social systems like home automation,corporate information, medical support and so forth.
