Schering, a unit of Schering-Plough Inc., the Madison,N.J., drug manufacturer, also contended the product couldhelp people lose weight without having scientific research tosupport that claim, according to Lewis Parker, the FTCofficial. As a result, he issued an order barring the companyfrom misrepresenting the amount or quality of fiber in itsproducts, and he said Schering must have at least twowell-controlled clinical studies before it can advertise suchweight-loss claims.</LP><TEXT>   The ruling stems from a 1989 case, in which the commissioncharged Schering with false advertising and makingunsupported claims.   Schering's ads didn't make it clear that the product mightwork if consumers dieted, Mr. Parker said. He added that evenif consumers dieted, the company didn't have evidence to showthe product would help them lose weight. The administrativelaw judge rejected the company's claim that consumers knowthat they must diet when using diet aids, noting thatSchering's own research shows that people who bought FibreTrim were looking for a &quot;magic pill&quot; to end the need to diet.   The company's ads also overstated the fiber content of theproduct by about 71%, Mr. Parker said. Schering later changedits ads when the manufacturer, Farma Food AS, a Danishcompany, told company officials there was a misunderstandingabout the fiber content.   Schering denied that its ads claimed Fibre Trim was anappetite suppressant and offered health benefits. But Mr.Parker agreed with the FTC charge that ad language claimingFibre Trim &quot;takes the edge off hunger&quot; and &quot;helps you controlyour appetite&quot; would lead consumers to believe the pill woulddo so.   The company has 30 days to appeal the order before theFTC; after that time, the order becomes final.</TEXT></DOC>
