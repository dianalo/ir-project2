By a 59-41 vote, the Senate rejected a proposal to allow thenation's 17 million union members to demand a refund of any duestheir unions spend on political activities.   ``If you don't do anything about this sewer money from unions, Idon't think you have campaign reform,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch,R-Utah. ``Ninety percent goes to Democrats, even though 30 percentto 40 percent of union members are Republicans.''   The Senate defeated a similar GOP-sponsored plan by a 63-35 votein May, rejecting a proposed amendment a bill easing restrictionson federal employees' political activities.   That bill was subsequently vetoed by Bush and the Senatesustained his veto.   Today, four Republicans, Sens. Alfonse D'Amato of New York, MarkHatfield of Oregon, James Jeffords of Vermont and Ted Stevens ofAlaska, joined all 55 Democrats to defeat an amendment to acampaign finance reform bill.   Bush said a year ago Congress should expand a 1988 Supreme Courtruling to give workers a right to seek a refund of their dues spentby unions on politics.   ``No American, not one, should be compelled to give money to acandidate against his or her will,'' he said.   On Monday, Democrats overrode unanimous Republican opposition toa provision in the bill that would provide $20 million in publicfinancing to Senate candidates every two years to buy televisionadvertising time.   The Supreme Court ruled in the 1988 case that a Bell Systemtechnician who paid fees to the Communications Workers of Americaas party of an agency shop contract with ATandamp;T but was not a memberof the union was entitled to a refund of the portion not spentdirectly on collective bargaining.   Hatch's amendment today would have extended that right to unionmembers as well as non-members covered by collective bargainingagreements.   Hatch said most union members do not know that their leaders arespending up to $150 million of their dues every two years onpolitical activities such as voter registration.   With a bipartisan compromise on campaign finance reform out ofreach for now, Republicans appeared content to let Democrats havetheir way in the knowledge that President Bush will veto it.   ``We are faced with a bill that everyone knows isn't goinganywhere, since it's a spending-limits bill that President Bushsimply will not sign,'' said Senate GOP Leader Bob Dole of Kansas.   Sen. David Boren of Oklahoma, the chief author of the Democraticmeasure, acknowledged the bill will never become law withoutsupport from Bush and congressional Republicans. But he expressedhopes the two sides will sit down in September to strike a dealonce the House has passed its version.   Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said he hoped to bring twoDemocratic proposals and a Republican alternative up for votesbefore the House begins a five-week recess on Friday. Democraticsources, however, expressed doubts it could be fitted into thisweek's schedule.   House Republicans accused Democrats in that chamber of cynicallywriting a bill that would establish spending ceilings but alsopreserve corporate, union and trade association PACs in the face ofa certain veto by Bush.   ``This is a joke,'' said House GOP Whip Newt Gingrich ofGeorgia. ``All the reform groups in the country are going to beenraged at them, so they want to get it over with, take theirbeating and go home.''   In contrast to an abolition of PACs first proposed by Bush andRepublicans in the Senate and now reluctantly also endorsed bySenate Democrats, both parties' bills in the House would retainPACs.   House Republicans would reduce the contributions a single PACcan make to any one candidate from the currently allowed $10,000 to$2,000 for both primary and general elections.   Both Democratic proposals in the House would establish aspending ceiling of $550,000 on House races. One would limit PACcontributions to half that amount and the other would limit them to40 percent, but with up to $100,000 in public financing for eachqualifying candidate.   Reform groups considered a litmus test the Senate's vote Mondayto provide party nominees for the Senate from $180,000 to $1.1million each in government vouchers to buy broadcasting time ifthey abide by spending limits.   ``It's a back-door attack on spending limits and a test vote tosee where they stand,'' said Joan Claybrook, president of PublicCitizen, which supports taxpayer financing of election campaigns.   All 44 Republicans present voted for the amendment by McConnell,the leading opponent of the Democratic plan to strike from it whatit called a ``food stamp voucher for politicians.'' Two Democrats,Howell Heflin of Alabama and J. James Exon of Nebraska, bothlongtime opponents of public financing, also supported McConnell'samendment.   In addition to the public financing of TV ads, the Democraticbill provides discount mail subsidies to candidates abiding by thespending limits as well as funds to counter broadcast ads byindependent groups costing over $10,000.   Additional public financing would also be provided to candidateswhose opponents exceed the voluntary spending ceilings.   McConnell's amendment would have eliminated all those potentialpublic sources of money in the Democratic bill. ``Underneath thehood, it's the same old lemon running on taxpayer financing andspending limits,'' he said.   The Democratic-proposed spending limits on Senate races _ basedon the size of a state's voting-age population _ range fromslightly under $2 million in less-populous states, such as Nevada,Montana and North Dakota, to $10.3 million in the largest state,California.</TEXT></DOC>
