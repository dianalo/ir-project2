He has been Democratic chairman of Rio Arriba County for 35 of his 72 years. His specialty is landslides. He gave even the hapless George McGovern a 57% county majority -- plus a monster barbecue that consumed 28 cattle. Now Mr. Naranjo is contemplating another barbecue, featuring either Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis or &quot;one of the Kennedys.&quot;    &quot;Naturally,&quot; he says with a modest smile, &quot;I am hoping for the big one.&quot; The Big Kennedy: his friend, Senator Teddy.    Somebody big will show up here for Mr. Naranjo's barbecue next month; count on it. That's because the mushrooming Hispanic vote is pivotal in this year's presidential election -- not just here in the mountains and ancient Spanish towns north of Santa Fe, but nationally.    Hispanics, estimated by the U.S. Census Bureau to number 18.1 million in 1986, are growing explosively. Their population has jumped a third since 1980. If present trends continue, they'll eventually outnumber blacks. And Hispanics are awakening nationally as a political force. In 1976, about 2.5 million of them had registered to vote. This fall, estimates the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project, the number may be nearly five million.    &quot;We're mainstreaming into the political community,&quot; says project president Andrew Hernandez. &quot;Hispanics are the swing vote this year, at least in California, Texas and New Mexico.&quot;    Hispanics are expected to account for only about 4% of U.S. voters this fall. But nearly 90% of them cluster in only nine states. And those states -- California, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, New York, New Jersey and Florida -- have 193 of the 270 electoral votes needed to elect the next president.    So both presidential campaigns are courting Hispanics, who tend to be conservative culturally but liberal on economic issues. The difference so far is largely one of emphasis. The Bush campaign emphasizes the cultural -- opposing abortion, for example -- while the Dukakis campaign emphasizes the economic. Each promises a Hispanic cabinet member. Republicans talk up Vice President Bush's Mexican-American grandchildren; Democrats emphasize that, unlike Mr. Bush, both Mr. Dukakis and running mate Lloyd Bentsen are fluent in Spanish.    The high priority the Dukakis campaign gives Hispanics is evident here in New Mexico, the nation's most Hispanic state. (It was 38% Hispanic in 1986, according to the Census Bureau.) New Mexico has only five electoral votes and hasn't voted Democratic for president since 1964. Yet Mr. Dukakis has allocated at least one precious campaign stop here, fielded a well-organized campaign and committed a budget of $100,000 to $200,000.    &quot;This is the best budget we've ever had in a presidental campaign,&quot; says former Democratic Gov. Bruce King. Last Sunday's Albuquerque Journal poll found a dead heat, with Mr. Dukakis edging Mr. Bush by a statistically insignificant one percentage point.    The national surge in the Hispanic population has led some analysts to talk of &quot;the Latinization of America.&quot; Yet for a variety of reasons, Hispanics are still struggling to translate potential political clout into actual political clout.    The first is that the Hispanic vote is nowhere near as big as the Hispanic population. The California Poll, for example, estimates that Hispanics make up fully 22% of that state's population -- yet only 12% of Californians eligible to vote. That's because a disproportionate number are either children or aliens. A chronically low registration rate further dilutes Hispanic power -- to a mere 8% of the 1986 California vote, according to the poll.    &quot;If you're a California candidate, the main group you want to appeal to remains white non-Hispanics,&quot; concludes Mark DiCamillo, the poll's managing editor. &quot;That's going to continue for a long time.&quot;    The second is that Hispanics are far from a monolithic voting bloc. A July poll for the Presidential Hotline newswire found Mr. Dukakis leading Mr. Bush 2-to-1 among Puerto Ricans and Mexican-Americans, still less than the 80% to 90% support he usually gets among black voters. But among Cuban-Americans, many of whom are conservative and fiercely anti-Communist, Mr. Bush led by a jolting 80% to 14%. Florida's Cuban vote is a major reason Mr. Bush is heavily favored to win that state.    In most states, however, the question isn't whether Michael Dukakis will carry the Hispanic vote. He will. The questions are how many Hispanics will vote and how big a majority Gov. Dukakis can roll up.    &quot;If Bush drops below 25% of the Hispanic vote, it gets scary,&quot; says Eddie Mahe, a Washington GOP consultant and former executive director of New Mexico's Republican Party. &quot;If we can get a third of the Hispanic vote, we'll be very comfortable.&quot;    Democratic pollster Peter Hart says at this stage his surveys in several key states show that as of today Mr. Bush is getting more than a third of the Hispanic vote.    A newly released NBC News poll of California voters -- which overall has the contest there almost dead even with Mr. Bush ahead by only 44% to 42% -- shows Gov. Dukakis leading among Hispanics, 55% to 37%. But, according to NBC, the vice president is doing considerably better among California Hispanic voters than Ronald Reagan did four years ago.    But here in New Mexico a poll also taken last week, for the Albuquerque Journal, showed Gov. Dukakis, who was holding a 43% to 42% overall edge, with a much bigger 66% to 17% advantage among Hispanic voters.    But in those two states and elsewhere the final outcome among Hispanic voters, for each candidate, will be shaped by factors more subtle than mechanistic get-out-the-vote drives, more personal than differing stands on the issues. Hispanics also respond to a candidate's personality and sincerity. That means Mr. Dukakis, still a relatively unknown quantity here in New Mexico, has some work to do.    &quot;He must show corazon -- heart,&quot; says Alan Armijo, Dukakis coordinator for Albuquerque's heavily Hispanic Valley region. &quot;People are hungry to get to know him more. They are waiting for something to happen from Dukakis.&quot;    New Mexico differs from other heavily Hispanic states in some basic ways. One is psychological: While Hispanics in other states feel like a minority, Hispanics here feel far more secure. After the Indians, they were here first; Spanish explorers arrived eight decades before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock.    Yet this state does embody the conflicting political forces shaping the Hispanic vote nationally. Here as elsewhere, the Hispanic population is skewed toward the young; as the young come of age, they could help Democratic presidential candidates. But simultaneously, as Hispanics slowly climb the socio-economic ladder, they're less inclined to follow Democratic patrons like Mr. Naranjo.    GOP Sen. Pete Domenici, of Italian extraction, swept the state with 72% of the vote in 1984. In 1986, New Mexico elected its first GOP governor in almost two decades, Garrey Carruthers. This year, a Democrat-turned-Republican who is related to two venerable Spanish families, Cecilia Martinez Salazar, is waging an uphill fight for Congress.    In New Mexico, unlike some other states, Hispanics give voting a high priority. &quot;They put family just under God, and politics just under religion,&quot; summarizes Domenici aide Tony Gallegos. Gradually, Hispanics in other states are moving in the same direction.    The Southwest Voter Registration Education Project expects the Texas Hispanic vote to jump to 650,000 or more this year, up from 493,000 in 1984. In California, it projects 800,000 Hispanic votes, up from 500,000 in 1976.    Meanwhile, the project keeps registering new Hispanic voters; it recently launched its 1000th registration drive since 1974. &quot;It's easy to get intoxicated with your successes,&quot; says President Andrew Hernandez. &quot;But in this business, if you're not moving forward, you're losing ground.&quot;    ---         States with Large Hispanic Populations    New Mexico                             37.8%    Texas                                  25.5    California                             23.0    Arizona                                15.3    New York                               11.9    Florida                                 9.9    Colorado                                9.7    New Jersey                              8.0    Illinois                                6.2   Source: U.S. Census Bureau, 1986 figures</TEXT></DOC>
