Granted, your team lostlast year, but at least you got to frolic in Florida. Thisyear's midwinter getaway will take you to balmy . . .Minneapolis.   Is this the National Football League's idea of a practicaljoke?</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The Super Bowl site is picked by an owners' vote,&quot; saysJames Steeg, the NFL's executive director of special events.&quot;There's no requirement to pick a warm-weather site -- butthey usually do.&quot;   The Jan. 26 game will be played in a domed stadium, butoutside the arena is where much of the traditional Super Bowlaction -- corporate parties, NFL media events or simpletourism -- takes place. And ticket brokers and travel agentssay this year's site has chilled activity.   &quot;A lot of times you have people buying {travel} packagesjust hoping to find {game} tickets in the city,&quot; says TimMoyer, a Minnesota native who is now a ticket broker inPhoenix, Ariz. &quot;They're thinking, `Hey, what's the worst thatcan happen to me -- a week of nice weather?' You really can'tsay that in Minnesota, so those people aren't coming.&quot; He andother brokers say the site is one reason they can only charge$600 or so for tickets (face value: $150), down from $750last year.   Some activities don't fit well in Minneapolis. GrandMetropolitan PLC's Heublein unit decided to hold a JoseCuervo tequila Super Bowl beach party -- in Cancun, Mexico.Its ads offered the lure of a big-screen TV on the beach andlisted reasons to visit Minnesota (such as: snowshoe rentaloutlets conveniently located; chartered snowmobiles to andfrom the stadium).   That irked a few snowbound Northerners. So, says MikeWhalen, an events producer for Heublein and others inMinneapolis, &quot;we thought it would be a good idea to dosomething here.&quot;   The solution: a beach party in Minneapolis. Heublein willcart sand into the International Market Square Atrium, anindoor gathering space, and add tanning booths, beachvolleyball and beach music. It expects more than 2,500 peoplethere, about the same as in Cancun.   The NFL says it isn't concerned about the cold. &quot;We'veheard stories about the weather deterring people,&quot; Mr. Steegsays. &quot;But the stadium will be full.&quot;   And warm. Indoors it will be 72 degrees and clear -- tothe roof. Outside, things could get ugly. The average low forJan. 26 is zero -- before the wind chill.</TEXT></DOC>
