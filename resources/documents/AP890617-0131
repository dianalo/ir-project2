WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When Jack Kemp accepted President Bush's offerto become secretary of Housing and Urban Development, it looked likea welcome chance to stay in the spotlight after the failure of hisRepublican presidential campaign.   Now that he is on the job, Kemp faces the task of cleaning up andairing out what may be the worst financial abuses lingering from theReagan administration.   The department that was regarded as a governmental backwaterduring eight years under Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. has beenshaken by a series of scandals stemming from that period.   Kemp, appearing Saturday on Cable News Network's ``Evans andNovak'' program, said abuses in HUD were not unique to the Reaganadministration and that political influence in the departmentexisted ``a lot longer than eight years.''   Kemp said Bush should get credit for any reforms at HUD, adding,``There was a poison in the system. And we have moved quickly totake the poison out.''   So far investigators report finding what appears to bemultimillion-dollar fraud, the steering of millions in public fundsto politically connected developers and consultants, andmismanagement on a staggering scale.   ``The scandal at HUD is one of the most complex national scandalsthat we have seen in decades,'' said Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif.,chairman of a House subcommittee investigating the department.   ``There is a degree of mismanagement, fraud, abuse, waste,influence-peddling that we have just barely begun to touch,'' hesaid.   Following charges on Capitol Hill that the Justice Department wasshowing little interest in some of the scandal, Attorney GeneralDick Thornburgh on Thursday ordered federal prosecutors toinvestigate all HUD offices for fraud and embezzlement.   The revelations have come so fast that investigators arehard-pressed to keep up. Together they suggest that HUD had become afinancial honey pot for developers, contractors, well-connectedRepublicans and others _ all in an era when the department wassubjected to large-scale cutbacks in social spending.   Pierce was one of the least-visible of Reagan's Cabinetsecretaries and the only one to serve throughout Reagan's eightyears as president. While his low-key role earned him the nickname``Silent Sam'' in office, he has become the political focus ofcongressional outrage.   ``Like picking up a large stone only to discover that bugs andslime have grown in the darkness, this investigation has exposed thecorruption which flourished unchecked under Secretary Pierce'sHUD,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a subcommittee member.   ``Secretary Sam Pierce ran the most sloppy, incompetent agency ingovernment that we have seen in perhaps a generation,'' said Lantos.   Pierce did not return phone calls to his New York law firm.Appearing before Lantos's committee last month, he said he delegateddecisions about awarding HUD grants to aides, including hisexecutive assistant Deborah Gore Dean.   Dean refused to testify, citing her Fifth Amendment rightsagainst self-incrimination. She has been quoted by the Wall StreetJournal as saying of the renovation program, ``We ran it in apolitical manner.''   Kemp has ordered investigations and has been praised by Lantosand others in Congress for dealing with the problems. The first ofthe scandals was revealed when Kemp released internal reports byPaul Adams, the department's inspector general.   They said millions of dollars in HUD subsidies for renovation oflow-income housing was distributed without regard to need orfairness, and that much of it was steered to private developers whoformerly had been HUD officials or had ties to prominent Republicans.   Adams found that developers who won subsidies paid millions ofdollars in consulting fees to former HUD officials and prominentRepublicans. Among them was former Interior Secretary James Watt,who was paid some $400,000. Others include Paul Manafort, aRepublican businessman who was a partner with Republican NationalChairman Lee Atwater before Atwater became Bush's 1988 campaignmanager; and the late Attorney General John Mitchell, who was aclose family friend of Dean.   Few of the consultants had housing experience. There has beenlittle evidence they did much work for their money, beyond makingphone calls and holding meetings with Pierce or other HUD officialsto secure the subsidy contracts for their projects.   The inspector general concluded there was a high cost totaxpayers in the program's mismanagement. He reported HUD could pay$413 million in excess rental assistance over the 15-year subsidyagreements because of the contracts.   The Justice Department has been reviewing HUD's internal audit ofthe program, but spokesman Joseph Krovisky said its preliminaryreview ``didn't show any criminal violations.''   Perhaps even more startling than the revelations aboutwell-connected consultants is evidence of embezzlement by realestate agents under contract to represent HUD in the sale ofproperty HUD owned because of foreclosures.   These agents were retained to close the sales and send theproceeds to HUD. It is a task that the Reagan administration tookaway from HUD employees and contracted out as part of the``privatization'' of government.   A Maryland woman, Marilyn Loise Harrell, has told investigatorsshe used her contract with HUD to improperly take as much as $5.5million.   Her scheme was hardly complicated. She told investigators that atfirst she began banking the money for a time and collecting interestfor herself. Soon, she said, she started keeping all the money dueHUD.   ``No one noticed when the proceeds were not remitted,'' she saidin a sworn statement.   She contends she used the money for charitable causes.Investigators, though skeptical, nicknamed her ``Robin HUD.''   Similarly, a grand jury in Fort Worth, Texas, indicted RebaLouise Lovell on charges of stealing $2.5 million from the sale of55 homes around Dallas. In Washington, D.C., investigators arelooking for a lawyer who disappeared over a year ago after servingas HUD's agent, and officials have said more than $3 million may bemissing.   Auditors and prosecutors are looking at all HUD property salearrangements, and HUD officials expect the reports of embezzlementto grow.   Investigators say they do not suspect a conspiracy among theagents to defraud the government, but believe each independentlydiscovered the same thing: no one at HUD was paying attention.   Still another scandal swirls around New York's Republicansenator, Alfonse M. D'Amato. A report in The New York Times, basedin part on a 5-year-old HUD audit, said officials in the village ofIsland Park on Long Island rigged the distribution of federallysubsidized houses in the early 1980s, selecting politicallyconnected recipients and keeping out blacks.   Among those allowed to purchase subsidized, inexpensive homes wasa cousin of D'Amato and the son of Geraldine McGann, a high-rankingHUD administrator who also sat on the village board. Some of thesubsidized houses were later resold at substantial profits.   Kemp has ordered a new audit and placed McGann on leave.   D'Amato has denied wrongdoing. But thanks to his lobbying, thevillage last year received $1 million in HUD money for constructionof a swimming pool.   D'Amato also has figured in allegations about the renovationsubsidy program. A former HUD official told the Wall Street Journalthat D'Amato pushed for approval of subsidy funds for projects inPuerto Rico _ and apparently with some success since 7 percent ofthe program's funds went to that small island territory. D'Amatodenied helping developers in Puerto Rico.   In addition, Kemp aide Mary Brunette said HUD has asked the U.S.attorney in Denver to investigate allegations that an accountant inthe agency's regional office manipulated an automated bill-payingsystem to siphon off $1 million.</TEXT></DOC>
