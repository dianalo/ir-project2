This was accomplished by answeringfour questions: (1) How do shock and bubble energies relate to boreholedecoupling? (2) How does decoupling affect the magnitude of energy loss?(3) Is energy loss due to loss of confinement or channel effects? (4)Are these effects limited to any one general phenomenon? Shock and bubbletests were conducted, and the results were compared with other researchfindings where breakage was measured. Also, a statistical model was usedto determine the significant relationship between the three independentvariables and the measured or calculated dependent variables. Then, amathematical comparison was made to show that measured breakage did infact correlate with eighter measured shock energy or measured bubbleenergy where pressure was the common denominator. Results showed thatthe bubble or gas energy correlated well with breakage and useful work,while shock energy did not. It also was found that maximum effects ofideal detonation did not occur at a decoupling ratio of one, but it occurredat about a ratio of two, where bubble energy was greatest and the shockenergy had already declined significantly.</TEXT></DOC>
