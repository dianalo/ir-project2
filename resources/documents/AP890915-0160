James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal andPlant Health Inspection Service, said about 20 screwworm larvae werefound Sept. 5 near San Juan on a horse that had been shipped fromVenezuela.   Beginning Friday, he said, about 800,000 sexually sterilizedscrewworm flies will be released twice a week for six weeks in afive-mile radius around the airport and the quarantine station.   The technique floods the suspected area with sterile male flies.If a female mates with one, her eggs will not hatch, thus ending thelife cycle. Normally, the eggs are laid in open sores or wounds ofwarm-blooded animals, hatching out into worms that feed on theliving flesh.   Glosser said the adult screwworm fly is about twice the size of ahouse fly, with orange eyes and a bluish-green body with three darkstripes along the back. Screwworm larvae are creamy white and growto about half an inch in length after five to seven days of feeding.   Screwworms were eradicated in Puerto Rico in 1975. The UnitedStates was declared free of the pests in 1966, although smallinfestations have occurred since then, mostly along the U.S.-Mexicoborder.</TEXT></DOC>
