Prices of long-term Treasury bonds inched lower as oil prices rose for the third consecutive day and as the dollar slumped in the foreign-exchange markets. Some 30-year Treasury bonds declined by slightly more than 1/8 point, or more than $1.25 for each $1,000 face amount. Corporate bond prices generally were flat, and municipal bond prices advanced.    Further clues to the economy's health and the interest-rate outlook are likely to emerge this morning when the Labor Department releases employment statistics for February. The report probably will indicate that the economy remains lethargic, according to most analysts in several recent surveys. Some contend that the economy is so weak that the Federal Reserve System will cut interest rates within a month or two in an effort to prevent a recession.    But many other analysts contend that the Labor Department figures will indicate that the economy is continuing to expand at a moderate clip and that the Fed doesn't need to provide additional stimulus. According to the average estimate of 15 economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets report, the number of workers on nonfarm payrolls rose 172,000 last month, following a 448,000 surge in January. Estimates range from 100,000 to 240,000. The average estimate on the civilian unemployment rate is for an increase to 6.8% from 6.7% in January.    &quot;Until a few weeks ago, the economy looked like it was getting stronger,&quot; said Garnett L. Keith Jr., vice chairman of Prudential Insurance Co. of America. &quot;But the latest batch of numbers makes everything look much more iffy.&quot;    Asked for an interest-rate forecast, Mr. Keith replied that rates probably will rise &quot;slightly&quot; over the next 12 months. But he added: &quot;We don't have enough conviction on the direction of the move, the size of the move or the timing of the move to use that forecast to direct our portfolio strategy.&quot;    To complicate matters further, many analysts agree that it is especially difficult to analyze recent economic statistics because of several special factors, such as the new tax law that took effect Jan. 1 and problems with seasonal adjustments.    Manuel Johnson, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said yesterday that &quot;it is impossible to tell&quot; right now whether the Fed will have to tighten credit conditions later this year to curb inflation. The Fed must &quot;wait for more data,&quot; he said at a meeting in Crystal City, Va., of the Eastern Economic Association.    The Fed reported yesterday that its basic money-supply measure, M1, rose $1.9 billion in the week ended Feb. 23. That was a smaller increase than most analysts had expected but it had little impact on the credit markets, mainly because most analysts assume the Fed is ignoring M1 in setting credit policy. The M1 measure consists of checking deposits plus cash held by the public.    The Fed estimated that the M1 measure rose to a seasonally adjusted average of $738.5 billion from $736.6 billion the previous week. Last year, M1 soared 15.2%, far above the Fed's target of 3% to 8% growth.    The Fed recently announced that it hasn't set an M1 target this year because of its suspicion that the measure isn't a reliable indicator of economic and inflation trends. But the Fed's Mr. Johnson said yesterday the Fed isn't totally ignoring M1. The Fed's decision not to set an M1 target &quot;does not mark the total abandonment of this aggregate,&quot; he said.    The Fed's policy-making committee &quot;will continue to monitor M1 behavior carefully, assessing its growth in the context of other financial and economic developments,&quot; Mr. Johnson said. &quot;And depending on circumstances this year, it is possible that at some time during the year, the committee might set more specific objectives&quot; for M1.    In the credit markets yesterday, the Treasury's 7 1/2% bonds due 2016 fell slightly to 100 20/32 from 100 26/32 Wednesday. The yield rose to 7.45% from 7.43%. The government's 7 1/4% notes due 1996 declined to 100 23/32 from 100 27/32, raising the yield to 7.15% from 7.13%.    Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds rose 0.20 point to wind up at 1434.85. That followed Wednesday's surge of 8.57 points, which was the biggest gain in about a month. The index yesterday hovered between 1433.31 and 1437.84, which is a small range.    &quot;The bond market spent the day backing and filling, basically just treading water,&quot; said Roger A. Froehlich, president of Technical Dimensions, a Mt. Kisco, N.Y., forecasting and advisory firm for the fixed-income markets. &quot;I don't think the markets showed any reaction at all&quot; to President Reagan's speech to the nation Wednesday night, he added. Raymond W. Stone, chief financial economist at Merrill Lynch Economics Inc., agreed: &quot;It was another boring day.&quot;    Interest rates on short-term Treasury bills inched higher. The rate on the latest three-month bill rose slightly to 5.50% bid from 5.49% on Wednesday. The latest sixmonth Treasury bill rate rose to 5.52% bid from 5.51%.    Elsewhere in the credit markets, Goldman Sachs andamp; Co. disclosed that it had liquidated a so-called dedicated bond portfolio for the American Airlines unit of AMR Corp. in transactions with a principal value of $4.2 billion.    Such portfolios gained popularity three years ago, when interest rates were far higher. They allowed companies to cut pension costs by assuming higher rates of return for assets matched, or &quot;dedicated,&quot; to known obligations to retirees. However, the advantage of such portfolios has declined due to the dropoff in interest rates and a change in pension accounting rules.    As a result, AMR assistant treasurer William Quinn said American sold $1.1 billion of bonds and bought bonds worth about $850 million through Goldman in late January. Because many of the bonds purchased were long-term, zero-coupon bonds, their principal, or face, amount was greater than $3 billion.    Mr. Quinn predicted more companies will also unwind their dedicated portfolios. Larry Bader, a bond analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc., which pioneered dedicated bond funds, agreed that dedication isn't appropriate any longer and that many such portfolios should be liquidated or revamped. Salomon estimates that $40 billion to $50 billion of bonds remain in such funds.    In the corporate market, a $250 million issue of Ford Motor Credit Co. notes due in three years, was offered to investors yesterday. A Goldman Sachs spokesman said the 6 7/8% notes were priced at 99.80 to yield 6.95%. The issue is rated single-A-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and double-A-minus by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    Underwriters led by Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. offered $100 million of Duke Power Co. first and refunding mortgage bonds, due March 1, 1997. The 7 1/2% bonds were priced after an auction at 98.875 to yield 7.663%. The issue is rated double-A-2 by Moody's and double-A-minus by Sandamp;P. </TEXT></DOC>
