Terms of the transactions weren't disclosed, but CBS sources, as previously reported, estimated that the broadcaster would receive more than $20 million for its one-third share. CBS said it expects the sale to close within 90 days.    Washington Post said the sale of its one-third stake will produce a gain of about $6 million, or 47 cents a share, in the quarter in which the sale takes place. The publishing company said it expects to complete the sale by year's end.    Woodbury, N.Y.-based Cablevision already owns one-third of SportsChannel, which serves subscribers in New England, New York, Chicago and Philadelphia.    A Washington Post spokesman said that &quot;because of delays in the cabling of certain cities, particularly New York, it has become clear that the investment is not producing for our company the financial returns we anticipated when we entered the business in 1983.&quot;    CBS couldn't be reached for comment last night, but a source had said earlier that the cable concern, which had been operating at break-even, no longer &quot;fit with the strategic direction of the company.&quot;    Cablevision executives couldn't be reached for comment yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
