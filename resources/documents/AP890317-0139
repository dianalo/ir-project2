Also Friday, protesters stormed the headquarters of the governingparty and battled riot police at three colleges, demanding theouster of President Roh Tae-woo, authorities said.   Protesters threw firebombs and rocks during the clashes andpolice responded with tear gas. At least five students were reportedhurt.   Partial service was restored on three of the city's four subwaylines after the return of about 3,300 workers who went on strikeThursday. But many of the returned workers refused to work, insteadholding protest meetings or refusing to follow orders, subwayofficials said.   Returned workers said they would not resume normal work untilpolice released all arrested strikers and dropped charges againststrike leaders.   About 15,000 riot police guarded subway stations to preventprotests by strikers. Some stations were shut with steel gratingslocked over entrances and riot troopers stood guard.   Hundreds of thousands of commuters who normally take the subwaystruggled for a second day to get to work. About 10,000 extra busesand army vehicles were mobilized by the government to help ferry the3 million commuters who normally use the subway each day.   Police on Friday released most of the 2,300 subway strikersarrested Thursday when riot police stormed a subway depot.   About 6,000 of the subway's 7,732 workers went on strike Thursdayto demand the resignation of the president of the city-owned system,Kim Myong-nong even though agreement had been reached on a new payand working hours agreement.   The college protests Friday broke out after about two dozenstudents stormed the headquarters of the Democratic Justice Partyand briefly occupied the roof and hurled firebombs at police. Theprotesters were overpowered and arrested by about 100 riot police.   Clashes later broke out at Seoul National, Dongguk and Kon Kukuniversities, with police involved in running battles with studentswho hurled firebombs and rocks and shouted anti-Roh slogans. About1,500 students were involved in the clashes.   Some opposition and dissident groups are making a joint effort todefeat Roh in an upcoming national referendum. Radical students vowto stage a wave of anti-Roh street demonstrations prior to theplebiscite, expected in mid-April.   Roh promised in a 1987 campaign to hold a referendum to letpeople assess his performance. Government officials have said Rohwould stay in power even if he is defeated.   A Cabinet minister who resigned this week said Friday that hestepped down to help Roh win the referendum. Political analysts andnewspapers speculated Kim resigned to express dissatisfaction withRoh for not having taken stronger steps against dissent.   Kim Yong-gap, a conservative former army officer, quit his postas administration minister after saying the government Tae-woo wasthreatened by radicals and dissidents.   ``I've resigned to make the nation aware of an expansion ofleftist forces,'' he said Friday. ``Democratization can be realizedonly by a strong government, and the ruling party must maintainstability by reorganizing the political setup after the appraisal,''he said, referring to the referendum.   He was replaced Thursday by Kim Yong-rae, Seoul mayor duringSeptember's Olympic Games and a bureaucrat who served under theauthoritarian government of former President Chun Doo-hwan.</TEXT></DOC>
