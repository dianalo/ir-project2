Less than a week after rebel soldiers launched a bid to topplePresident Corazon Aquino, officials are talking about seriousdamage to efforts to attract foreign investment to this strugglingnation.   ``The cost (of the attempted coup) was high not only in life andproperty, but in terms of investments,'' said Sen. John Osmena.``Tourism will dry up for the next year. The economic recovery hasbeen stalled.''   Political unrest is never good news for national economies. Butthis sixth coup attempt against Mrs. Aquino's government spellsparticular trouble because the main battlefield has been thecountry's financial center, including three luxury hotels filledwith wealthy foreign guests.   The country's two stock exchanges are located in Makati and havebeen unable to operate since the coup attempt began Friday.Business sources say the exchanges are considering waiting a day ortwo after order is restored before reopening for fear that shareprices in the opening hours will collapse.   Banks and shopping centers in Makati are believed to havesuffered substantial damage in recent fighting, which broke outduring what should have been the height of the Christmas sales rush.   Among the foreigners held hostage in Makati hotels are leadingTaiwan industrialists, including Jeffrey Koo, the powerfulpresident of the China Trust Co. Ltd., and Japanese investors, thetype of people with the capital needed to help fuel fuel economicgrowth in the Philippines.   ``The Japanese have really been terrorized there (in Makati),''House Speaker Ramon Mitra said Monday. ``Many of them areinvestors, can you imagine the damage this will bring?''   Sony Corp. of Japan has said the company may postponeconstruction of an audio equipment plant if the Philippines seemsheaded for more instability.   Manila can ill afford squeamishness on the part of cash-richTaiwan, which had $133 million in approved investment in thePhilippines in the first three quarters of 1989, up from $109million for all of 1988.   ``If the situation continues to deteriorate, the major investorsmay withdraw their investment,'' Chi Min-shen, an official ofTaiwan's official Industrial Deveopment and Investment Center saidin Taipei on Tuesday.   Taiwan businessmen ``would not risk their lives for whateverincentives or privileges are offered,'' he said, referring to taxbreaks and market access concessions that Manila offers to attractoverseas investors.   The Manila fighting also comes just after Mrs. Aquino's trip toCanada and the United States to seek new investment. In her manyappearances before North American business groups, Mrs. Aquinoassured would-be investors the Philippines was stable, even as heradversaries were finalizing plans for a coup.   Last week, Mrs. Aquino said: ``Foreign investment is increasingbecause the message has got through that the country is politicallystable and the daily danger of coups is long past.''   In fact, the Philippines has chalked up some respectableeconomic statistics. In the first nine months of 1989, the realgross domestic product rose 6 percent from the same period a yearearlier.   Investing in the country can be profitable. The Hong Kong-basedJardine Fleming's Philippine Trust rose 183 percent in the first 10months this year and more than 2,000 percent in the past five years.   Manila and other Southeast Asian capitals have long sought toparlay cheap labor and abundant natural resources to create theirown economic miracles to follow the trailblazing path set by Asia'sdynamic ``little dragons'' of South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong andSingapore.   To what degree the coup attempt will derail such plans remainsto be seen. Philippine officials clearly hope the damage can becontained.   ``There is no doubt that investments will be affected as aresult of the events that have transpired, but I would like to lookat that as something temporary,'' said Trade Secretary JoseConcepcion. ``We have to give assurances to foreign investors thatthis is the last coup.'' </TEXT></DOC>
