A principal sourceof blade fatigue is thought to be the stochastic (i.e., random) aerodynamicloads created by atmospheric turbulence. This paper discusses the developmentof a model for the simulation of these stochastic loads, given the rotorgeometry, operating conditions, and assumed turbulence properties. ADouble-Multiple-Streamtube analysis is employed, which includes the effectsof wind shear. Reynolds number variations, different airfoil sectionsand chord lengths along the blade span, and an empirical model for dynamicstall effects. Calculations are presented for the VAWT 34-m Test Bedcurrently being assembled at Bushland, Texas. Time histories of the loads,as well as their Fourier spectra, are presented and discussed. An unexpectedfinding is that the average output power is predicted to be more sensitiveto turbulence level than had previously been thought. 24 refs., 11 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
