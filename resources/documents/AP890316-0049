DALY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush is being asked to back up hispresidential campaign rhetoric blasting Gov. Michael S. Dukakis forfailing to clean up Boston Harbor.   Dukakis, for whom the polluted harbor became a politicalliability, asked the Bush administration Wednesday to put ``itsmoney where its mouth was.''   ``When you make the kind of statements that were made in thecampaign, you've got an obligation to make good on them,'' Dukakissaid.   The governor faulted Bush for proposing cutbacks in federalwastewater construction programs that would cost Massachusetts $40million. In addition, he charged that while Congress has earmarked$59 million for the Boston Harbor project, the Bush administrationhas not included those funds in its budget.   Dukakis said he was confident the Massachusetts congressionaldelegation would reverse those decisions.   Bush, as the Republican candidate for president, staged asurprise cruise in September on Boston Harbor to criticize Dukakisfor pollution.   Dukakis supporters argued that the governor was primarilyresponsible for the legislation designed to end the pollution by thenext century.   But the charges, reinforced by a Republican campaign TVcommercial, stuck to Dukakis, leaving the Democrat on the defensive.   ``I'm proud to say that as of today, we're right on schedule _and that's the way we're going to keep it,'' Dukakis told reportersWednesday, flanked by Environmental Affairs Secretary John DeVillarsand Massachusetts Water Resources Authority Executive Director PaulLevy.   The governor ticked off a series of steps already taken toaddress the harbor pollution, beginning with the creation of thewater resources authority.   Noting that the agency has already spent $350 million of theprojected $6.5 billion cost, Dukakis said the state water authorityhas stopped the discharge of ``floating scum'' from its agingtreatment plants at Nut Island and Deer Island.   Dukakis promised that families will notice cleaner beaches thissummer in the metropolitan area.</TEXT></DOC>
