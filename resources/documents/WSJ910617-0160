The class-action suit, filed in federal court inPhiladelphia, is believed to be the first major attempt byworkers to recoup pension losses resulting from a company'sinvestments in a financially troubled insurer.</LP><TEXT>   Unisys, a computer maker and defense contractor based inBlue Bell, Pa., was one of the nation's heftiest investors inExecutive Life's guaranteed investment contracts, investmentvehicles for pension and savings plans. Unisys investedapproximately $200 million of retirement funds with the LosAngeles-based insurer, the complaint said.   Executive Life, a unit of First Executive Corp., alsobased in Los Angeles, has been paying individual annuityholders 70 cents on the dollar since regulators took controlof the company in April. But companies that hold guaranteedinvestment contracts have so far received nothing. Californiaregulators have said that payments to the insurer'sguaranteed investment contract holders will be delayed andeventually may be cut.   Executive Life and its New York affiliate had $3.1 billionin more than 300 guaranteed investment contracts outstandingat the end of 1990, much of that retirement-related.   In an effort to protect retirees, the Labor Departmentearlier this week filed two similar suits against Maxxam Inc.of Houston and MagneTek Inc. of Los Angeles, for theirinvestments in Executive Life annuities. It was the firsttime the department had sued a company because of itsallegedly unwise purchases of annuities for pensions.Executive Life was named as a defendant in these suits,although it is not a defendant in the Philadelphia suit filedlate last week.   The 3,000 or so plaintiffs in the Unisys suit are mostlyretirees and active members of the International Union ofElectronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine and FurnitureWorkers, AFL-CIO. They allege that Unisys and 12 officialsviolated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, orERISA, by &quot;imprudently&quot; investing their retirement plancontributions in the insurance contracts of a company&quot;well-known for its investments in risky `junk bonds.'&quot;   The engineers also allege that in the spring of 1988,officials of one union local complained to the company thatthe Executive Life investments were unsafe and urged them todiversify. When Executive Life fell into the hands ofregulators two months ago, the company allegedly told theunion and employees it was not responsible for any losses tothe retirement plan, according to the suit.   &quot;What we think makes the suit novel is that the unionofficials had been telling the company's investment committeethat they were way off base in these investments,&quot; saidJudith Vladeck, of the New York law firm Vladeck, Waldman,Elias andamp; Engelhard, who is representing the plaintiffs.   A Unisys spokesman said, &quot;At the time when we invested inExecutive Life, two of the three most widely accepted creditrating agencies gave {it} their highest rating. The thirdalso gave it a high rating.&quot; He added that the contracts werebinding for a five-year period. The company entered its lastguaranteed investment contract with Executive Life inDecember 1987, the spokesman said.   ---   DEFENDANT MAY GET stiffer sentence for violatingemployer's trust.   In a two-to-one decision, a panel of the Second U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan upheld a lower courtruling that added six months to the 18-month prison sentenceof a former Piedmont Airlines ticket agent who allegedlystole $50,000 in airline tickets.   Michael Castagnet was convicted of using Piedmont'sticket-counter computers early in the morning and late atnight to issue himself tickets. Although the crime occurredafter he left the company, the court ruled that he had abuseda unique position of trust with the airline. The appealscourt ruled that the past relationship between the ex-agentand the airline &quot;provided the ability to commit the crime&quot;and allowed Mr. Castagnet to create airline tickets&quot;unobserved.&quot;   The court, noting the paucity of precedents in this area,described trust as the &quot;extent to which the position providesthe freedom to commit a difficult-to-detect wrong,&quot; adefinition adopted by another federal appeals court.   In a written dissent, Judge Frank X. Altimari argued thatMr. Castagnet held a low-level position with the company andlacked any special skills or knowledge that warranted anyfinding of violated trust. He said Piedmont had ampleopportunity to investigate such cases of embezzlement.   &quot;This will ensnare a lot of small people who probablydon't deserve the sentence,&quot; warned Henriette Hoffman, aLegal Aid attorney who represented Mr. Castagnet. &quot;You'regoing to be {punishing} many people at low levels, whether atbanks or post offices.&quot;   ---   NO-FAULT COMPENSATION proposed to replace obstetricmalpractice litigation.   Attorneys and physicians are debating a proposal thatwould automatically award predetermined sums to obstetricpatients who suffer a preventable injury. Instead of bringingmalpractice suits, victims would receive compensation fromthird-party insurers according to the severity and type oftheir injuries.   Nationwide, obstetric malpractice premiums average $38,000a year, said Ken Heland, head of the department ofprofessional liability for the American College ofObstetricians and Gynecologists. More than 12% of theassociation's members have closed their obstetric practicesbecause of liability concerns, according to a 1990 survey bythe organization.   The no-fault compensation proposal, based on a study of285 obstetric injury cases, was made in the June 5 issue ofthe Journal of the American Medical Association. Randall R.Bovbjerg, a senior research associate at the Urban Institutethink-tank in Washington, D.C., and co-author of the article,said the no-fault system would provide a &quot;more neutral, morereliable&quot; method for awarding damages. He argued that thesystem would encourage victims to seek compensation becausecostly, time-consuming court proceedings would be eliminated.   Attorneys, however, say litigation is often the only fairway for patients to recover damages.   &quot;We're quite concerned about any proposal that seeks tolimit the rights of victims of malpractice to go through thecourt system and seek the full extent of their compensation,&quot;said Laurence R. Buxbaum, executive director of the New YorkTrial Lawyers Association.   Mr. Bovbjerg's article suggests that his plan would removefrom the courts half of all obstetric malpractice cases --which account for three-quarters of all damages awarded underthe current system. The other cases, involving primarilynon-preventable injuries, would still require litigation.   Mr. Bovbjerg said that a no-fault system could also beapplied to other kinds of medical malpractice, especiallysurgery-related cases.   ---   TWO SEATTLE law firms will merge.
