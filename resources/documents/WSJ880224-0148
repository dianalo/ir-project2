That decision was made largely to avoid friction with the U.S., which considered the ban a barrier to trade and had threatened retaliation.    Trade officials in Washington have said the ban would cost the U.S. $100 million in annual export sales.    A U.S. source, who declined to be identified, said any measure that &quot;counters&quot; the hormone ban &quot;would be good news&quot; for the U.S. But he said the long-term impact of yesterday's court judgment wasn't clear.    A spokesman for the EC Commission said the judgment means the ban will have to be approved again by the EC Council of Ministers. In its ruling, the court said the legislation was invalid because the EC member states hadn't followed the correct procedures when the law was adopted on Dec. 31, 1985.    The law was passed by a so-called written procedure, in the face of opposition by Denmark and Britain, which brought the case to the European court. The court said this method of adopting EC legislation was valid only if the law was approved by all member states.    Britain was concerned that the majority vote on the hormone ban would be used as a precedent to undermine British rules on keeping animal diseases out of the country. </TEXT></DOC>
