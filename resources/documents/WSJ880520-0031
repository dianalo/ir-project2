For most of this year, the chemicals maker was flying along, forecasting robust earnings and touting an ambitious expansion plan, while letting its heavy debt ride. But Carbide's surprise decision, announced Wednesday afternoon, to slash its high-yield dividend by 46% has shocked and infuriated Wall Street. Analysts say the move makes Carbide's planned offering of 15 million common shares look unappealing.    Analysts and portfolio managers predict the repercussions will be felt for a good while. Many have stopped recommending the stock. Some even vow to try to discourage their securities firms from giving Carbide any help with its planned stock offering.    In the past two days, Carbide shares have fallen. They closed yesterday at 18 1/8, off 5/8, on almost six times normal daily trading volume as more than 4.6 million shares changed hands, making it the second most active issue on the Big Board. For now, prospects of a strong rebound seem remote. Indeed, speculation has begun to spread about lawsuits, a proxy fight and even a possible takeover attempt -- on the theory that the depressed stock price makes Carbide vulnerable.    Analysts attending a meeting with Carbide officials in New York yesterday acted like lions in the gladiator ring. Garo Armen of Dean Witter offered Carbide Chairman Robert D. Kennedy a pile of airsickness bags to indicate the results of an informal survey he had taken. Later, he called the company's management &quot;deceitful.&quot; Patricia O'Brian of Anantha Raman andamp; Co. called Carbide's new plans &quot;ludicrous.&quot;    Carbide's profit outlook continues to be strong; most analysts still expect 1988 earnings of $3 to $4 a share, compared with $1.76 last year. But investors who had been attracted by Carbide's once-generous quarterly dividend of 37.5 cents a share -- now reduced to 20 cents -- might not find another reason to pick this stock over others in the industry. In fact, analysts now see many reasons to discourage investors -- unless they want to bet on a takeover battle.    Management's credibility appears to be Carbide's biggest problem.    Early this year, Mr. Kennedy told analysts that he was expecting a recession and that their 1988 estimates of Carbide's earnings were too high. In mid-April, in an interview with this newspaper, he said he had been mistaken about the recession.    Instead, he said then that Carbide's earnings looked very strong for the year and that the company would begin a big capital investment program to take advantage of the industry's unprecedented upswing. And about three weeks ago at the annual shareholders meeting, he was ebullient, declaring, &quot;I'm pleased to report that the state of our business is very, very good.&quot;    But yesterday, Mr. Kennedy said Carbide now believes it needs to &quot;add a safety valve that says, 'Let's reinvest and pay down the debt.'&quot; He added that the plan would bring &quot;solid, long-term growth.&quot;    Mr. Kennedy's defense didn't sit well with analysts. &quot;I feel foolish going out and telling shareholders one thing and then they (Carbide managers) say they'll do another,&quot; said Harvey Stober of Dean Witter. William Young of Drexel Burnham said of Carbide's management, &quot;They're saying, 'We're just going to be a big macho growth company. We don't care about the shareholders.'&quot;    Others questioned whether a big expansion program is the right move. While Mr. Kennedy said chemicals and plastics investment opportunites are the &quot;best in years,&quot; chemical companies have learned that expanding capacity in good times can cost them in leaner times. One portfolio manager said, &quot;We'd rather see a little less expansion and a hold on the dividend.&quot;    The announcement of the stock offering also appeared badly timed. The market has been jittery this week.    In addition, most chemical stocks aren't performing particularly well these days, because of fears that industry earnings have reached their peak. &quot;Investors are acting as if the end is around the corner,&quot; said Dean Witter's Mr. Stober. &quot;Nobody wants to stick around for the funeral.&quot;    Mr. Kennedy responded with an emphatic &quot;No&quot; to one analyst who asked him to reconsider the dividend cut. By trimming the payout, Carbide will retain an extra $71 million a year in profit.    The chairman said that a possible payout cut had been considered for several months but that the decision wasn't made by the board until Wednesday. He maintained that he previously indicated to analysts that, under certain circumstances, the dividend was no longer &quot;sacred.&quot;    The stock-offering proceeds would be used to pay down about $300 million of Carbide's $3.2 billion of debt, reducing debt by next year to 55% of capital from 64% now. Mr. Kennedy said that a better balance sheet was an &quot;overwhelming consideration&quot; and that he preferred to achieve that goal &quot;under the cover of favorable conditions,&quot; rather than in a recession.    ---   Union Carbide   (NYSE; Symbol: UK)   Business: Chemicals, plastics and gases.
