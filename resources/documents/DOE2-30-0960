<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-30-0960 </DOCNO><TEXT>The alternating current properties modified by the exposure of a dielectricsupported discontinuous film of copper + cuprous oxide to parts-per-millionconcentration levels of diisopropyl methylphosphate (DIMP) are reported.In addition, the merit of integrating these films with the distributedRC notch network sensor is investigated. The frequency-dependent resistance[R/sub p/(f)] is interpreted in terms of a simple equivalent circuitcomposed of frequency-independent parameters whose values were determinedby using a nonlinear least-squares analysis. The parameter changes causedby DIMP exposure can be differentiated between those associated withthe bulk conductivity of the islands compared to their gaps. A detectionscheme based upon the distributed RC notch network is evaluated. In operation,changes made in the lumped notch tuning resistance to reestablish a preexposednotch depth directly correlate with the independently measured resistancechange of the gas-sensitive film.</TEXT></DOC>
