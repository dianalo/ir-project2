(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Full-Text DBMS Marketplace Is BoomingandM;Never accuse database management system (DBMS) vendors and buyers of failingto recognize a good thing when they see it.andP;  Full-text search-and-retrievaldatabase management systems are now something of a gold rush market.andM;Products that let users call up entire documents from databases form afast-growing software area, according to International Data Corp. (IDC).andO;Officials at the Framingham, Mass., market research company said the numberof vendors offering full-text DBMS products has more than doubled in the lasttwo years, from about 20 to nearly 50.andM;&quot;The mysticism of full-text is beginning to erode,&quot; said Eric Goodwin, vicepresident of sales for Fulcrum Technologies, an Ottawa, Canada, company thatmakes the Full/Text system.andM;In the DEC market, full-text systems are sold by CompuServe Data Technologiesof Cambridge, Mass.; Data Retrieval of Milwaukee; Henco Software of Waltham,Mass.; Unibase Systems of PArk City, Utah; Information Dimensions of Dublin,Ohio; and Information Access Systems of Boulder, Colo., among others.andM;Vendors take slightly different technological approaches to full-text DBMSes,but the basic idea is the same: Instead of storing information in individualfields and records as traditional DBMS packages do, full-text DBMSes letusers store, search for and retrieve full documents.andM;Vendors say full-text DBMSes work well in helping users search throughinformation that lacks a formal structure--a series of invoices, forexample-and providing a framework that is efficient and transparent to users.andM;Whether the application is a legal brief, a scientific abstract or thecollected public statements of a political rival, a full-text databasemanagement system treats the information much as a human researcher would butwith far greater speed and accuracy.andP;  (See &quot;Full-Text Systems Help Engineers,Cops Find Facts,&quot; page 65.)andM;At 3M Information Services, the average information search used to take 15minutes, said system analysts Dan Willis.andP;  Now, with CompuServe DataTechnologies' System 1032 4GL/DBMS implemented on a VAX-11/780, it takesabout five seconds.andP;  &quot;It's also a more reliable search than depending on thememory of someone,&quot; Willis added.andM;While some analysts and vendors wonder whether the market can support all thenew suppliers, no one questions the reasons for fielding a full-text productin the first place: Demand is strong and expected to grow even more over thenext five years.andM;IDC forecasts a 61 percent increase in shipments each year between 1987 and1992, IDC analyst Molly Upton said.andP;  Revenues are expected to escalate 52percent per year during the same period, she said, because of falling prices.andO;Indeed, lower prices are a big reason for the popularity of full-textsystems.andM;LAst year, prices for an average VAX-based full-text system started in the$15,000 to $20,000 range.andP;  This year, it's possible to find full-text systemsstarting at $3,000--though prices at the high end still run into the tens andeven hundreds of thousands of dollars.andM;Vendors say the increased number of vendors--and the attendantcompetition--is a big factor in price erosion.andM;Fulcrum's Goodwin noted that prices for full-text systems are expected todrop approximately 13 percent a year for the next five years.andP;  The drop canbe attributed almost entirely to competitive pressures, he said.andM;Private Sector ExpansionandM;But industry insiders say that, unless vendors can quickly attract a widerfield of end users, at least a few vendors will go bust in the next couple ofyears.andM;One hopeful sign has been the expansion into private industry from thegovernment, which, historically, has been the biggest buyer of full-textDBMSes.andM;Industry watchers say that in the past two years, corporate demand in theUnited States and Europe has sparked new product development.andP;  There are fewvertical markets&quot; for full-text DBMSes, though some industries are adoptingthe systems more quickly than others.andP;  Law, Fulcrum's Goodwin said, is &quot;themost obvious market that everyone gravitates to.&quot;andP;  He noted that lawyers andparalegals must research and collate mountains of documents, briefs andresearch notes, often under tight deadlines.andP;  Lawyers make up nearly 10percent of the 2,500 users of Fulcrum's Ful/Text product, he said.andM;Pharmaceutical companies form an &quot;up-and-coming&quot; market as well, according toPamela Bliss, an industry analyst for Dataquest, a market research company inSan Jose, Calif.andP;  &quot;When you deliver a drug [to the Food and DrugAdministrational], you have to deliver a truckload--literally a trailertruckload--of research notes, quality assurance tests, you name it,&quot; shesaid.andM;But, rather than concentrating on targeting specific markets, many developersseem to be devoting more time and effort to a basic but critical task:expanding the general customer base.andP;  Specifically, vendors are trying todevelop ways of demystifying user interfaces and query languages.andP;  The goalis to make products that can be used not only by librarians and informationspecialists, but also by information consumers.andM;Although several vendors are moving toward natural-language interfaces andrudimentary artificial intelligence (AI), most full-text systems do theirindexing using more conventional methods, such as key words, strings andBoolean logic.andM;&quot;Developers seem to realize that they need to move this into the next level,&quot;Dataquest's Bliss said.andP;  Common query methods, such as key words and Booleanphrases, are difficult to understand and use, she said.andM;There are hopeful signs for more standardized full-text query languages,however.andP;  ANSI recently approved the industry's first standard, calledZ39.50, for full-text DBMSes, and a few vendors have begun to implement it.andM;Support of such a standard might not be competitive or technologicaladvantage for vendors right now.andP;  But numerous industry insiders agree that,even if an ANSI standard does nothing to advance the state of the art inquery languages, many corporate MIS departments by the mid-1990s will rejectany full-text packages that don't meet the standard.andM;However, that's not to say that vendors are about to choose conformity over aleading-edge position in user interfaces.andP;  Several vendors, notablyInformation Access Systems (IAS) of Boulder, Colo., are experimenting withforms of AI to create an interface that is easy to use.andP;  Such an interfacewould not demand the exact query language that DBMS products traditionallyhave required.andM;According to IAS officials, the company's AI facility, knows as J-spacetechnology, used in the company's Intelligent Text Management System (ITMS)package simulates human thought.andP;  By analyzing the language of the requestthe program searches for functional similarities between the terms.andP;  It thenretrieves documents according to a quickly created hierarchy, which thenranks each document according to its applicability to the query.andM;Charles Terry, general manager of CompuServe said, &quot;We have been looking at[AI technology] the last six months.&quot;andM;Data Retrieval of Milwaukee has also considered expanding what has been itslimited use of AI technology as a front end of its TextDBMS.andM;Standards efforts and technologic adventuring are signs of a growing,maturing business.andM;&quot;The market is moving beyond the information science people,&quot; said WilliamBoehlke, president of Laticorp of San Francisco.andP;  &quot;We're going after thecorporate marketplace where text information has a lot of value.&quot;andM;Laticorp's target list for its Textbase and Context packages includes mostleyFortune 1000 companies with the need--and money--for full-text DBMSes.andP;  Endusers include marketing professionals, risk management executives, policiesand procedures specialists, and sometimes accountants.andM;One Laticorp customery, in fact, is a Big Eight accounting company thatneeded to put the accounting code for the U.K.andP;  on PCs for its staff, Boehlkesaid.andP;  In some ways, he said, that is a typical, ideal application forfull-text retrieval systems.andM;Another example of a good use is putting The Wall Stree Journal on adatabase, then searching for all references to British purchases of U.S.andO;pharmaceutical companies, he said.andP;  &quot;One area where [full-text] is reallymaking major advances is as a front end for on-line databases and fordatabases on CDROM,&quot; Dataquest's Bliss said.andP;  &quot;For many of the developers Italk to, that seems to be a consistent story.&quot;andM;That's not to say that the popular commercial databases are about to switchto full-text systems.andP;  Even though CompuServe Data Technologies has developeda full-text DBMS product, for now, its parent company does not plan toimplement the product for its on-line information service.andM;&quot;You can't get enough people on a full-text system at five bucks an hour andmake any money,&quot; CompuServe's Terry said.andP;  &quot;It takes a lot of horsepower todo full-text search.&quot;andM;But, for systems in which users number in the hundreds rather than in thetens of thousands, a full-text DBMS has become an attractive commodity.andM;Apparently, in such cases, it matters little whether the end user is aprivate on-line service or an in-house database.andP;  The real question, expertssay, is whether the cost of the system can be justified by increasedproductivity and greater research accuracy.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
