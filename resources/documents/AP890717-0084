The Italian Institute for Foreign Trade was not at its assignedbooth, nor was the Association for British Commerce in China. TwelveThai companies, a Papua New Guinea exhibit and a large West GermanEconomics Ministry exhibit also were missing.   Instead, several dozen stalls at the Beijing International Fairwere occupied by Chinese exhibitors filling in for foreign companiesthat backed out at the last minute, either in protest or nervousnessover last month's violence in Beijing.   The 10-day trade fair, which opened Friday, was Beijing's firstsince the army crushed student protesters and supporters in streetfighting, killing hundreds and perhaps thousands of people.   According to the fair catalogue prepared in advance, the Eastbloc countries, China and South Korea _ debuting at a Chinese tradefair _ were expected to dominate, with relatively few Westernexhibitors.   But even fewer Westerners showed than expected, and even severalEast European companies stayed away out of nervousness. ThoseWesterners who came kept a low profile.   ``Right now we're not talking to the press,'' said a woman at thebooth for the U.S.-China Industrial Exchange Inc., one of twoAmerican exhibitors.   ``There was some question of `to be or not to be,''' said arepresentative with the Czechoslovak company Technopol, which wasexhibiting a wide range of equipment including industrial-sizedkitchen appliances.   But he said, ``I have no feeling that it's dangerous to be here.It was terrible, what happened, but I'm sure more people die in ayear in New York City than died in the city of Beijing'' in theclashes. He refused to give his name.   ``It's better for us, frankly, that they didn't come,'' he saidof the absentees. ``We don't have so much competition.''   The official Chinese media have publicized the fair as an exampleof how life in Beijing and relations with foreign countriessupposedly have returned to normal. They have not mentioned thosewho stayed away.   Chinese reports also have been silent about one prominentparticipant: South Korea.   Ten South Korean companies filled half of one large hall at theChina International Exhibition Center, in a step forward for the twocountries' newly formed trade ties. Although China still recognizesNorth Korea and has no diplomatic ties with Seoul, it announced lastyear it would pursue trade with capitalist South Korea.   Fair brochures did not mention South Korea, but listed itscompanies under the umbrella Korean Trade Promotion Corp.   Thousands of Chinese wandered among the nearly 3,000 exhibits onSunday and Monday, but few seemed to be there to do business.   ``People come to look around, not to buy,'' said a collegestudent who said her father was working at the center and gave her aticket. Tickets were needed to get in, but none were on sale _ allwere distributed by work units to employees as perks.   Young men with blue work trousers rolled halfway up their legsand women with children examined a sporty black Daewoo Racer carparked in the South Korean section. ``Look, it has seat belts,'' oneboy shouted. Few Chinese cars do.   Technopol's exhibit also was a big draw when the company begandemonstrating its kitchen equipment by mixing and baking dozens ofrolls. ``Soon we'll have something to eat,'' joked one passerby.   But the biggest attraction seemed to be a bank of Samsung TV setson which Western music videos flashed. Dozens craned to watch asMadonna pranced and sang, ``Like a Virgin.''</TEXT></DOC>
