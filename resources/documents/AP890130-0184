Since those verdicts, the Mafia seems to have moved a step ormore ahead of the state as the mob schemes to safeguard itsinterests, which include billion-dollar international drugtrafficking and control of lucrative public contracts in developingsouthern Italy.   Investigators also suspect the king of the Corleone crime family_ there actually is one _ comes and goes as he pleases in Palermo,Sicily's capital and largest city.   The last photograph investigators have of the Corleone leader,Salvatore Riina, is 30 years old, and for all they know, the manbelieved to be the most powerful Mafioso in Sicily today, probablyhas had plastic surgery to change his looks.   Alberto Di Pisa, the chief anti-Mafia prosecutor, notes that theSicilians' fear of Mafia revenge and their mistrust of the statemake it unlikely an ordinary citizen would turn Riina in.   The Corleone family gets its name from a Sicilian town. TheAmerican author Mario Puzo used that name for the main character inhis novel ``The Godfather'' and it was used as well in Godfathermovies. While the Corleone clan has its roots in the town, its powerbase is believed to have shifted to Palermo.   The claim that Riina moves boldly and openly in parts of Palermowas made on state television recently by Salvatore ``Totuccio''Contorno, a Mafioso-turned-informer. His testimony helped convictthe 338 defendants, many of them top mob bosses, on murder, drug andother charges in Italy's largest-ever case against the mob.   The interview was made in the United States where Contorno livesunder a secret identity provided by U.S. authorities after hetestified for them.   Italian investigators ruefully acknowledge that the state of theanti-Mafia front in Italy is so dismal that Contorno's claim maywell be true.   Among the setbacks in the past year in the war against the mob:   _The slaying of Judge Antonio Saetta, who had been assigned tohear the appeals of the maxitrial this year. The Mafia this decadehas assassinated several investigating magistrates but until Saettawas killed the mob left presiding judges alone.   _A court ruling that prosecutors can't automatically try mobsuspects in one mass trial on the sole basis that the Mafia isdirected by a Palermo-based ``commission,'' which the state did inthe maxitrial. Prosecutors say the ruling weakens their ability topresent stronger, more comprehensive cases that are more likely tohurt big-time mob bosses.   For many prosecutors and police officials, the appointment ofDomenico Sica as the high commissioner against the Mafia wasvirtually the only bright spot. Sica earned national fame as aprosecutor assigned top domestic and international terrorist cases.   But Sica, in a speech in January summing up his first six monthsas Italy's top anti-Mafia fighter, complained that he needs moreexperienced consultants and said the quality of information from aspecial intelligence unit at his disposal was unsatisfactory.   ``We can't provide a detailed picture of the Mafia today,'' saidGuido Lo Forte, an investigating magistrate, in a recent interviewin Palermo's Palace of Justice.   He said the mob now appears to be circulating less and lessimportant information within its ranks one way of eliminating therisk of witnesses.   At the same time, the lack of a government witness protectionprogram discourages potential informants. Two of informantContorno's brothers-in-law were killed by the mob in Palermo inrecent months.   What investigators would especially like to know is new Mafiastrategies for avoiding tightened financial checks.   ``Iron Tower,'' a joint U.S.-Italian investigation, disclosed inDecember that South American cocaine was being sent to Italy inexchange for heroin, some of it shipped in liquified form in winebottles.   According to investigators, such bartering avoids incriminatingbank records.   Authorities say the Sicilian mob's share of worldwide drug tradehas declined in the past few years. One reason is U.S. and Italianprosecution; the other is competition from South American and Asiancrime syndicates.   ``The biggest chunk of Mafia earnings today comes from politicalcorruption and public contracts,'' says Pino Arlacchi, a sociologistwho studies organized crime.   Laws were enacted in the early 1980s requiring those bidding forpublic contracts to prove they had no Mafia links, but Lo Forte saysthe mob got around the restrictions in some cases by intimidating``clean'' Sicilian businessmen to front for Mafia enterprises.   Prosecutors also say that since the investigation that led to themaxitrial, police work has yielded nothing of real substance; fourtop anti-Mafia detectives were slain by the mob in the last fewyears.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Mon PMs Feb. 6</NOTE></DOC>
