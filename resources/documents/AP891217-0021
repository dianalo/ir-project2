The expected round of credit easing in response to evidence of aweakening economy and moderating inflation would cause a variety ofbusiness and consumer rates to fall, the economic forecasters say.   Among the rates that could drop would be the prime rate and homemortgage rates.   The Federal Open Market Committee is meeting Monday and Tuesdayfor its final strategy sessions of the year. Most analysts werelooking for the Fed to decide to reduce a key interest rate, thefederal funds rate, by another 0.25 percentage point.   ``Fed officials have more than enough evidence to justifyanother easing step before the end of the year,'' said David Jones,chief economist of Aubrey G. Lanston andamp; Co. ``It will takeadditional easing steps to guarantee that we don't go into arecession. I think we will avoid a recession, but just barely.''   Some analysts said the reduction could come before the week isout while other analysts said the rate drop might not occur beforeearly January.   The federal funds rate, the rate banks charge each other onovernight loans, is the primary lever the central bank uses tocontrol short-term interest rates.   When it does fall, economists were predicting that the benchmarkprime lending rate, to which one-third of all business and consumerloans are tied, would be cut from 10.5 percent to 10 percent withanother cut to 9.5 percent expected before summer as the Fed easesfurther.   Analysts were looking for mortgage rates to drop as well inresponse to the Fed's credit easing moves. Many predicted thatfixed-rate mortgages, which have already fallen to a nationalaverage of 9.75 percent, could fall as low as 9.25 percent by nextsummer.   Jones and other economists point to various signs that theeconomy is passing through a period of extreme sluggishness, withunemployment beginning to inch back up, raising fears that someunexpected shock could spell the end of a recovery that has alreadylasted a peacetime record of seven years.   When 1989 began, the central bank was in the midst of ayear-long effort to push interest rates higher in an effort todampen demand and keep inflationary pressures in check. However, inMay the Fed switched course and began a series of gradual easingmoves as signs mounted that economic growth was beginning to slowin response to the earlier credit-tightening.   Inflation has eased with the slowing of growth.   On Friday, the government reported that wholesale prices fell inNovember for the third time in the past five months, with the dropled by a big decline in gasoline costs.   ``Inflation has decelerated enough so that the central bank hasa margin of comfort to ease interest rates to boost economicgrowth,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.   The Bush administration has complained that the central bank hasbeen too timid in its credit-loosening campaign and will have tobear the blame if the economy does go into a nosedive.   But the consensus among most economists is that the Fed's doseof easy money has come in time to keep the country out of arecession.   Before the Fed began its gradual credit-easing moves, thefederal funds rate stood at 9.75 percent. It is now at 8.5 percent,having been reduced in a series of five 0.25 percentage point drops.   Jones said he expected the federal funds rate would fall to 7.75percent before the Fed calls a halt to its easing campaign.   But when the economy begins to rebound next summer, manyeconomists were looking for the Fed to reverse course once more andbegin tightening up on credit to guard against triggering higherinflation.   ``We think the economy will start accelerating in the secondhalf of next year and inflation will become a little worse as laborcosts begin to accelerate,'' said David Wyss, senior financialeconomist at DRI-McGraw Hill, an economic consulting firm.</TEXT></DOC>
