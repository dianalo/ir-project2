<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-80-0097 </DOCNO><TEXT>The role of bone scintigraphy in the staging of bladder carcinoma beforeattempted radical therapy was evaluated from a personal series of 71consecutive cases. The results from this were correlated to previousreports - accumulated data from a total of 458 staging bone scans werethus obtained. In this accumulated material metastases were diagnosedin 4.6% - in 2.8% true positive and in 1.7% false positive findings.The effect of the bone scanning results on therapy was minimal: cystectomywas performed in spite of the diagnosis of metastases in 16 out of 21patients. In only 4 patients (0.9%) surgery was avoided because of scintigraphyresults. Scintigraphy thus has no place in the routine preoperative stagingof bladder carcinoma.</TEXT></DOC>
