Elliptic partial differential equations are used to generate gridsin the physical plane. The Navier-Stokes equations in vorticity-stream-functionform and the energy equation have been solved numerically by finite differencemethod for Reynolds number range of 10 to 200. Numerical solutions interms of drag coefficient and Nusselt number have been obtained. Theresults are compared with the results obtained in an earlier study aswell as those in the literature.</TEXT></DOC>
