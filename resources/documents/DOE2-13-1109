Becausethe cross section of this reaction at small angles ({Theta}/sub lab/{le} 15/sup 0/) lay below the detection limit of 1 {mu}b/sr it was firstnecessary to determine optimum kinematical conditions for the study ofthe reaction /sup 124/Sn(/sup 18/O, /sup 20/Ne). For this purpose systematicstudies of the angular distributions of the (/sup 18/O,/sup 20/Ne) reactionon target nuclei with mass numbers between 28 (/sup 28/Si) and 208 (/sup208/Pb) were performed at beam energies of 82, 102, 141, and 189 MeV.The evaluation of these measurements gave first information on the dependencesof the cross sections on energy, Q-value, target mass, and angle. Forthe /sup 124/Sn(/sup 18/O,/sup 20/Ne)/sup 122/Cd reaction a maximum crosssection of about 1 {mu}b/sr at a beam energy 30 MeV above the Coulombthreshold (100 MeV) and a laboratory angle of 40/sup 0/ could be expected.In a new experiment this prediction could be verified. The analysis ofthe measured spectra yielded a Q-value for the /sup 124/Sn(/sup 18/O,/sup20/Ne)/sup 122/Cd reaction of 0.1 +- 0.44 MeV. The mass excess of -82.08+- 0.44 MeV calculated from this for /sup 122/Cd is by 1.5 MeV more positivethan the prediction of the Wapstra table. (orig./HSI).</TEXT></DOC>
