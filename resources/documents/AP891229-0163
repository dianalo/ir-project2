(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Stiff high altitude winds forced aneighth postponement Friday night of the launch of Martin Marietta'sfirst commercial Titan 3 rocket carrying British and Japanesecommunications satellites.   When the countdown reached the five-minute mark, the launch teamheld it there for nearly an hour while officials assessedlast-minute data received from weather balloons.   With the shear winds about 30,000 feet up still too high, theeffort was called off once again. The launch was rescheduled for7:07 p.m. Saturday.
