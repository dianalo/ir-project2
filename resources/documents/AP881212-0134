The early deep freeze _ more than a week before the officialonset of winter _ caused water pipes to burst, cars to die andhomeless people to seek warmth in shelters. It also producedscattered power outages, record power demand and public-transitdelays.   Greg McGarry, a spokesman for the Albany (N.Y.) Medical CenterHospital, said he experienced the subzero air fully with his sons ontheir morning paper route.   ``It's unbelievable,'' McGarry said. ``They were dying.''   Weekend snow and ice were blamed for a dozen traffic fatalitiesin the nation's midsection. Snow was falling Monday over parts ofMinnesota and North Dakota. Snow was forecast for Wisconsin, a snowadvisory was in effect for eastern Oklahoma and parts of Arkansas,and wintry weather was expected in the Carolinas.   The cold weather was caused by arctic air that flowed acrossCanada and into the north-central and northeast United States, saidHugh Crowther, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service'sSevere Storms Center in Kansas City, Mo.   ``About 25 cities reported record low temperatures thismorning,'' he said Monday.   Among them were Albany, N.Y., were thermometers dipped to 12below zero; Allentown, Pa., 2 degrees; Asheville, N.C., 16 degrees;Baltimore, 12 degrees; Boston, 2 degrees; Detroit, 2 below zero;Elkins, W.Va., 10 below; Hartford, Conn., 3 below; Houghton Lake,Mich., 12 below; Newark, N.J., 6 degrees; Philadelphia, 8 degrees;and Wilmington, Del., 8 degrees. Washington, D.C., tied its recordfor the date of 13 degrees.   Saranac Lake, N.Y., near Lake Placid, had the coldest temperaturein the nation Monday morning, 28 below zero.   ``It gets colder than this _ sometimes 30 below,'' said residentMary LaRose, who said schools were open but village streets werequieter than usual.   The bitter temperatures forced the homeless off the streets inmany cities, agencies reported.   ``We've filled every bed we have. It usually gets worse when theweather gets colder _ people who normally might not come here showup because they just can't bear the cold,'' said Edith Richardson,assistant supervisor of the 113-bed Detroit Rescue Mission.   In Philadelphia, city workers and police tried to round uphomeless people. In New York City, where the temperature dipped to arecord-low 5 degrees, police took only four homeless people toshelters late Sunday and early Monday. Three came in voluntarily; acold weather alert gave police the authority to move the fourthagainst her will, said a department spokesman, Sgt. Maurice Howard.   Two people in New York apparently didn't make it to a shelter. Ahomeless man was found Sunday on a Brooklyn street, apparentlyfrozen to death, police said. His identity was not known. AlsoSunday, a woman was found dead in an underpass of a subway station,and police said she may have died from a combination of a drugoverdose and the cold.   In Baltimore, fire killed a woman in her 60s early Monday in ahouse where heat and electricity had been turned off. The womanapparently was using candles for heat and light, said Fire Capt. PatFlynn.   Also Monday, Baltimore police responding to an anonymous callfound an infant wrapped in a trash bag outside a vacant house. Theboy, believed to be two days to a week old, was reported in goodcondition at a hospital.   ``He had not been there very long. He was warm to the touch,''said a police spokeswoman, Agent Arlene Jenkins.   Frozen switches slowed Philadelphia-area commuter trains, andfrozen signals delayed the PATH train system that links northern NewJersey with Manhattan.   In Delaware, Delmarva Power and Light Co. said high power demandhampered its efforts to restore power to about 10,000 customersafter an equipment failure. The cold was a factor in scattered poweroutages affecting at least 2,900 customers in Connecticut, NortheastUtilities said.   The New England Power Pool, an association of 96 electricutilities, expected Monday's power useage to set a record. NiagaraMohawk Power Corp. reported a record-high winter power demand acrossNew York state.   In Boston, near-zero temperatures hampered crews trying to shutdown a broken water main that closed a section of a busy artery forabout three hours. Plows were called to clear about eight inches ofslush formed by the thousands of gallons of water.   In Hartford, Conn., burst pipes forced firefighters to pump waterout of the first floor of the Legislative Office Building.   In Rochester, N.Y., where the mercury plunged to 8 below, peoplewith car trouble were calling in record numbers to the RochesterAuto Club, said club president Charles Gertner.   More than a foot of snow caused hundreds of weekend trafficaccidents in Ohio, leading to four deaths, authorities said. Windwhipped up to 2 inches of snow in Kansas, causing hazardous drivingconditions and several fatal accidents that left six dead. Twohighway fatalities in Pennsylvania on Sunday and Monday were blamedon icy roads.</TEXT></DOC>
