But the cramped commuters only gazed at him with curiosity, applauding politely. What would have been a security nightmare for his two main opponents became an amicable rush-hour ride for Mr. Kim.    Kim Young Sam is an unlikely hero in South Korea, a moderate 59-year-old party leader whose biggest draw is that he excites few passions in an increasingly passionate presidential battle to be decided Dec. 16. Even his closest advisers concede he is the least charismatic, visionary and articulate of the candidates. Yet Western diplomats and Korean pollsters say he has mounted the most successful campaign.    He has won support by painting himself as the candidate of the middle who is least likely to face either left-wing street demonstrations or right-wing ouster after a victory. In interviews, he uses the words &quot;gradual and slow&quot; as almost a policy mantra. &quot;I am the only safe road for Korean society,&quot; he says.    &quot;Kim Young Sam doesn't arouse harsh feelings one way or the other,&quot; a Western diplomat agrees. &quot;That's both his strength and his weakness.&quot;    The diplomat believes Mr. Kim has a tenuous edge because many voters view him as the man best equipped to give them the gradual change they desire -- voting the military-linked government out -- and continued stability. The question is whether on election day they will consider him capable and strong enough to maintain the country's economic strength and stand up to North Korea.    &quot;Kim Young Sam has succeeded in planting himself in the middle in a society that is much more middle-oriented than most people assume,&quot; says Lee Hong Koo, a political scientist at Seoul National University, who says more than 65% of South Koreans consider themselves middle class. &quot;The question now is whether people really believe Kim Young Sam can maintain the essential law and order to preserve the middle.&quot;    With 30% of the electorate still undecided, picking a winner is ill-advised. But ruling party advisers concede that Kim Young Sam has stolen much of the early momentum from government candidate Roh Tae Woo by bringing voters to focus on the former general's role in the 1979 coup. Meanwhile, Mr. Roh has hurt opposition rival Kim Dae Jung by keeping alive doubts that the army and security services would let a man take power who they have long insisted is a dangerous radical.    Weekend events have helped Kim Young Sam: The country's first female presidential candidate, Hong Sook Ja, threw her support to him, and more than a million countrymen attended his Saturday rally. The moderate middle has been further encouraged by his promise over the weekend that he would form a &quot;grand coalition government&quot; to embrace &quot;all democratic forces of the nation.&quot;    But newspaper columnist Kim Jin Hyun, from the opposition Dong-A Ilbo, concludes that most of Mr. Kim's popularity is due to the fears he plants in voters minds. He says many voters believe massive student protests would follow a Roh Tae Woo victory, and military intervention or noncooperation could undermine Kim Dae Jung, whose moderate election platform hasn't erased years of propaganda from the security services that he is a dangerous radical.    The mood among ruling party members is more sober than it was in October when they most feared Kim Dae Jung's ability to excite voter passions against them. Instead, Kim Young Sam led the attack by recruiting Chung Seung Hwa, a general and former chief of staff, who in a series of speeches and interviews has drawn attention to Mr. Roh's role in the 1979 coup.    &quot;We all thought this would become one of the issues in the campaign,&quot; says Kim Jin Hyun. &quot;But no one expected Kim Young Sam would do it so successfully and make it such a focal point.&quot;    But the ruling party still has advantages over Kim Young Sam, ranging from a huge war chest to a large core of people who will vote for the government because they believe their jobs depend on it.    Moreover, Mr. Kim slipped up at a recent campaign stop, saying the threat from North Korea has receded, something the ruling party is certain to focus upon if it becomes any clearer that last week's Korean Air Lines crash, which killed 115 people, was caused, as widely suspected, by North Korean terrorism.    Other gaffes make voters question his grasp of issues. At a news conference, he confused tactical nuclear weapons with nuclear energy plants. The avid jogger (every morning at 6 a.m.) and mountain climber (once a week) comes close to conceding intellectual failings.    &quot;You can borrow wisdom, but you can't borrow good health, &quot; he says. &quot;Why do I need good advisers if I know everything.&quot;    One Kim Young Sam adviser says he now views the race as one between Kim Young Sam and Roh Tae Woo, largely because Kim Dae Jung hasn't been able to expand his backing as much as he had wanted among his core supporters in his home province of Cholla and among students and anti-government dissidents.    U.S. diplomats do have doubts about how effective a leader Kim Young Sam would be as a man not known for making tough decisions easily. But Korean analysts note that he probably would cause the least problems for the U.S.    If government candidate Roh Tae Woo wins, the U.S. may be in the awkward position of having to judge how fair the election was while street protests spread. If Kim Dae Jung wins, the U.S. would have to quickly endorse him and make sure the South Korean military heeds Washington's often-stated opposition to intervention.    &quot;From the U.S. standpoint, Kim Young Sam is the least burden,&quot; says newspaper columnist Kim Jin Hyun. &quot;At least over the short term.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
