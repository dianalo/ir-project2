U.S. immigration officials refused to allow the family back intothe United States on Dec. 23 after they falsely claimed U.S.citizenship. Officials say the family has a record of immigrationfraud.   ``If they (U.S. immigration officials) do not change their minds,then we have no choice'' but to apply for asylum, said CarlosFajardo, whose family has been stranded in a Niagara Falls, Ontario,motel since Dec. 23. Fajardo said he would apply on behalf of hisfamily.   Fajardo, his wife, Bermaida, 33, and her two children, Yoandys,12, and Yordalys, 9, crossed into Canada to see part of NiagaraFalls and were refused entry back into the United States.   Canada issued the family a tourist visa that expired Sunday.Canadian immigration officials now say Fajardo will have to applyfor asylum soon or leave the country.   ``Up until this point the problem has been between them and theU.S. government,'' Albert Opatovsky, manager of the CanadianImmigration Service office in Niagara Falls, said Monday. ``Now theybecome our concern.''   Opatovsky said an immigration inspector was to interview thefamily Monday afternoon. A date for an immigration hearing could beset this week, he said.   Fajardo, 39, said he still wants to return to his home and boatbuilding business in Miami. He said he does not want to move toCanada. He was adamant about not returning to Cuba.   Benedict Ferro, district director of the Immigration andNaturalization Service in Buffalo, said Sunday that Fajardo isbelieved to have illegally entered the country in 1985 from Panamaand Mrs. Fajardo was ordered deported last summer.   Ferro said Fajardo's application for asylum in the United Stateswas pending when he crossed the border. The application wasnullified when he entered Canada, he said. Applicants for asylummust stay in the United States until their status is determined.   Ferro said the woman was stopped by immigration inspectors in1986 when she illegally entered the United States with falseVenezuelan papers.   ``She might not have been deported yet, but only because this wasa low-profile case for us,'' he said.   Ferro also raised new questions about the family.   He said Fajardo may have an 18-year-old daughter and a wife _apparently his first wife _ living in the United States. Mrs.Fajardo's first husband also may be living in the United States, hesaid.   ``They both have extended families, apparently all in the UnitedStates, and they may be all illegally here. And maybe that's whynobody can petition for them,'' Ferro said.   The couple claims to have gotten married last October or Novemberbut immigration officials can't find a record of it, Ferro said.   He said that despite the pleas of Hispanic groups and U.S. Sen.Bob Graham, D-Fla., he would not issue a ``humanitarian parole'' toallow the family to return to its home.   ``To do that would be a slap in the face to the hundreds ofthousands of people who are attempting to enter the countrylawfully,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
