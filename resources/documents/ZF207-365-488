 Thenew version, which is being shipped as a free upgrade to all current users,fixes what have been perceived as the two key obstacles to the product'swidespread acceptance: the need for too much memory and too high a price.andM;Technical improvementsandM;The original version of IBM Interleaf Publisher, announced in April 1988,required 6 MB of memory on an 80386-based PC or PS/2.andP;  Few dealers stock suchpower-packed boxes, and with the price of memory so high last year, onlythose users that needed Interleaf's advanced document processing featureswere willing to make the investment.andM;The new version uses a new DOS extender from Phar Lab that builds virtualmemory support into the product.andP;  This enables the program to treat the diskas an extension of memory (albeit slow memory) so that it runs well with just2 MB of RAM.andM;Of course, using the hard disk as RAM is slower than running with 6 MB, butthe new version will make use of extra RAM, if you have it.andP;  The advantage isthat now you can buy the product with only 2 MB and upgrade as needed.andP;  IBMestimated that with 4 MB (which is now the standard memory of some models)the new version is roughly comparable in performance to the old one for manytypical documents.andM;A side benefit of the new extender is that you can create documents virtuallyunlimited in size, because now the entire hard disk is your memory buffer forholding the document.andP;  IBM said it tested the software with documents over1,000 pages in length with no difficulty.andM;There are several other changes in the new version of IBM InterleafPublisher, which IBM is treating as a maintenance upgrade (dubbed Version1.0.1).andP;  The most important of these is in the use of fonts.andM;Better font management.andP;  The new version includes an installation utilitythat enables the user to remove or install fonts individually orcollectively.andP;  This is useful for saving space on the disk (by removingfonts) and for making use of downloadable fonts.andM;Interleaf's software has its own imaging model that depends on bit maps forall of its screen fonts.andP;  If a screen font exists, it presumes the printerfont exists, but in the MS-DOS and Mac versions of Interleaf's software youcannot substitute one screen font for another (e.g., display 10-point typewhen specifying 11-point type), even though your PostScript printer cangenerate the 11-point type from its outlines.andM;As a result of Interleaf's imaging model and its decision to include avariety of fonts in different sizes, the original version of IBM InterleafPublisher occupied about 23 MB of space on the hard disk.andP;  With the new fontutility, users can pare that down to as little as 12 MB by removing selectedfonts or all fonts but Times, Courier and Helvetica.andM;The standard font selection for IBM Interleaf Publisher remains 45 screenfonts in a variety of fixed sizes.andP;  This includes the 35 Adobe fonts of theLaserWriter Plus, plus 10 others that are on the IBM 4216 PostScript printer.andM;But to accommodate users who want to make use of downloadable fonts (much asMac users make use of any font loaded in the system), Interlfeaf is nowbundling Bitstream Fontware for the PC with the new version.andP;  As a sample ofhow the program works, Bitstream has included its Charter typeface in theFontware package.andM;With Fontware for the PC, the user can construct screen fonts to go with theprinter fonts.andP;  These can be added to Interleaf's font menu using a new fontutility.andP;  The free space on your hard disk is the only limitation to thenumber of new fonts you may add.andM;One irritation is that you still cannot construct new screen fonts of theAdobe fonts in the new version.andP;  This means that you are stuck with the sizesInterleaf provides in the Adobe fonts.andP;  In the Bitstream fonts, you mayconstruct screen fonts in any size from 6 to 144 points.andM;Other enhancements.andP;  The remaining changes to the program are minor:andM;* Three more character sets, French, German and Scandinavian character setshave been added, but these are for input of characters only.andP;  Foreignlanguage support in composition and spelling checking is available only onthe upper-level Interleaf products.andM;* Superscript and subscripts have been added.andM;* Serial PostScript printers (using xon/xoff as the protocol), such as theApple LaserWriter, can now be driven from IBM Interleaf Publisher.andM;* Improved filters--the MS-DOS version of Interleaf has a nice assortment offilters available from within the Interleaf desktop.andP;  (The workstationversions have filters outside of the program.andP;  Alas, neither has a XyWritefilter.)andP;  The desktop filters have been improved to include better errordetection.andM;Easing the learning curveandM;Despite the excellent training and application documentation that accompaniesthe software, Interleaf is initimidating to many users who don't want to haveto look in the manual.andP;  To overcome this fear--and make the product moreaccessible to dealers as well--Interleaf has developed two new diskettes ofsample documents.andP;  The idea behind the new additions is to get the newcustomer up and running with the program as quickly as possible.andM;&quot;Point and Type.&quot;andP;  The first diskette is a set of very generic documents thatact as predefined templates.andP;  Interleaf had already provided a few templatesfor specific types of documents in its Create Cabinet within the software.andO;The samples in Point and Type, which may be copied into the Create Cabinet,are generic documents designed for the novice just learning the program.andM;&quot;Explorer.&quot;andP;  For users who want to peek a little further into what thesoftware can do but still don't want to break the shrink-wrap on the manual,Interleaf now offers the Explorer diskette, which contains a variety ofsupplemental application samples.andM;We still believe that the product's manuals are worthwhile reading for anycustomer, but the new disks should help smooth customer resistance.andP;  Dealersshould be particularly pleased, because they now have demo documents that donot require much expertise to display.andM;Mass--market pricingandM;The real breakthrough on the new release, though, is the dramatic pricecut--from $2,495 to $995.andP;  IBM and Interleaf want the IBM Interleaf Publisherto be a mass-market product, and if the new pricing doesn't achievemass-market acceptance then probably nothing will.andM;Of course, the cost of the hardware required to run the product has droppedconsiderably, too.andP;  The list price for a Model 55SX with 4 MB of RAM, a 60-MBdisk and monitor is under $6,000.andP;  A Model 70 with the same configurationlists for under $10,000.andP;  With memory prices in the $250/MB to $450/MB.andO;range, that translates to a $1,000--$2,000 savings, not to mention the factthat it is much easier to find a 2-MB machine in stock that it was to find a6 MB Model 80 a year ago.andM;As if that weren't enough, IBM is greasing the sales wheels by discountingthe product to $ 750 for the first three months (through the end of August).andO;It has already begun sending the demos out to dealers, and it is giving awaythe upgrades for free to all registered users.andM;In a rare concession that the software business is different from thehardware business, IBM is selling the product as software only.andP;  Since IBMInterleaf Publisher runs on most 80386-based clones of the IBM AT, that meansIBM will even sell it to you if you don't have an IBM PS/2.andM;New positioning.andP;  With the new aggressive pricing of the product comes a newmarketing pitch from Interleaf and IBM.andP;  No longer is it positioned as theVentura-killer, although in some respects it is now a better buy for themoney: The base packages are roughly comparable in price, but Interleafoffers much more in graphics, charting and long-document handling.andP;  Venturaoffers better typography, tabling and networking--but only in its optionaladd-ons, which can raise the price over $1,500.andM;The new strategy is to position the product as the complete documentprocessor for 80386 machines, distancing itself from &quot;postprocessors&quot; likeVentura and Aldus PageMaker.andP;  Those are page layout programs.andP;  Interleaf isword processor, business and drawing graphics, image editor and page layoutprogram all in one integrated, very attractively priced bundle.andP;  Rather thanuse a word processor for text entry, a page layout program for publishing anda presentation package for overhead tranparencies, Interleaf's message is touse IBM Interleaf Publisher for all of your basic, as well as your moreadvanced, office document needs.andM;Given the changes to the program, the recent fall in memory prices andgrowing acceptance of 80386 PCs, we find it an alluring offer.andM;The only thorn remaining is the fact that Interleaf remains out of thePresentation Manager environment.andP;  With the big splash last month aboutOfficeVision and SAA, it may seem odd that IBM would now offer an MS-DOSproduct for general office document processing that offers a completelydifferent desktop metaphor than Presentation Manager.andP;  The reality is thatSAA is a long-term strategy, one for which products will be slow in comingbefore late next year.andP;  In the meantime, IBM Interleaf Publisher is availableimmediately running under MS-DOS.andP;  Thus, IBM Interleaf Publisher solves IBM'simmediate need for a leading '386 product.andP;  In the long run, we believe thatInterleaf will be forced to adapt its desktop to that of Presentation Manageror face being the odd man out in the next generation of publishing.andP;  But,then, you have to leave something for release 2.0.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
