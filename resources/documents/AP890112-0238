Prices of Middle East oil are still below OPEC's targeted priceof $18 a barrel, and some of the recent gains may still be lost ifthe excess oil produced by the cartel late last year reaches themarket.   Since Nov. 28, when the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries announced it would curtail production, Middle Easterncrude oil has risen more than $3 a barrel _ from approximately $11to about $15.   West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark grade of crude oil,has shot up to more than $18 a barrel from $15.03 the day the accordwas finalized.   Most market observers had expected prices to rise but they hadforecast a more gradual increase with the excess oil keeping pricessoft for some time. Despite the recent increases, experts remaindoubtful about the future.   ``I don't see $18 in the year for OPEC basket prices, at leastnot for any sustained period. There is an overproduction that wewill still see the consequences of down the road, '' said JohnLichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation.   At the time of the OPEC agreement in November, the 13-membercartel was producing approximately 22.5 million barrels of oil aday. In December, that figure rose to about 23 million.   For January, OPEC's production will be about 19 million barrels,slightly above its new quota of 18.5 million. OPEC's accord tookeffect Jan. 1 and extends for six months.   Since it takes four to five weeks for most Middle East oil toreach markets in the United States, analysts believed shiploads ofcrude pumped late last year would be arriving on U.S. shores any daynow, driving prices lower. But they haven't, and the question manyare asking is: Where is it?   ``I suppose some production could be in transit, but we werehearing about surplus production as early as October and it hasn'tshown up in the statistics,'' said Gordon Pye, an economist withIrving Trust Co. ``It calls into question the accuracy of the OPECfigures we read about. ... Either that or it's being consumed morerapidly than anyone thinks.''   Nauman Barakat, vice president of energy investments forPrudential-Bache Securities Inc., believes a lot of the excess oilis sitting in storage tanks somewhere in the Middle East.   ``There was an intentional decision by the cartel to keep as muchof that crude as possible off the market so as not to flood themarket and force prices lower,'' Barakat said.   Demand for OPEC oil in major oil-consuming countries like theUnited States and Japan has been stronger than projected. A reportWednesday from the International Energy Agency showed industrializedcountries consumed 38.4 million barrels a day of oil in the fourthquarter, 1 million barrels or 4 percent more than previouslyforecast. The report said U.S. consumption was up 4.5 percent whileJapanese consumption rose 6 percent.   Nevertheless, many analysts believe high demand won't be enoughto boost or sustain prices for Middle East oil at the $18 level forthe length of the agreement. One OPEC country, the United ArabEmirates, has already acknowledged it is producing above its quota.   ``The question still is `Will OPEC stick to its quota beyond thefirst quarter?''' said Lichtblau.</TEXT></DOC>
