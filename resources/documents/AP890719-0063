Nopickup.</HEAD><DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Britain and Vietnam have agreed secretly to forcethousands of Vietnamese refugees in Hong Kong to return to Vietnam,British news reports said today.   The Guardian newspaper said the agreement was confirmed bygovernment officials in London and in Hong Kong. It did not identifythe officials.   The British Broadcasting Corp. said without attribution in aradio bulletin that details of the reported agreement had beendisclosed in Hong Kong.   The Foreign Office would not confirm the report, and Hong Kongofficials refused comment.   The Guardian said the refugees to be repatriated have beenclassified as economic migrants from Vietnam rather than genuinerefugees. It said more than half the 50,000 boat people in Hong Kongare likely to be sent back to Vietnam.   The BBC said the reported agreement has been kept secret to avoidprovoking possible unrest among refugees in the British colony.   The number of people fleeing Vietnam has increased in recentyears, many due to the poor state of Vietnam's economy rather thanpolitical oppression. Many nations that have been accepting therefugees have called for limits.   The Guardian report quoted one source as saying the repatriationscould begin within a week. It said a meeting between British ForeignSecretary Sir Geoffrey Howe and his Vietnamese counterpart, NguyenCo Thach, on June 28 had paved the way for the agreement.   The paper also said Britain has agreed to end its embargo oneconomic aid to Vietnam and will provide various forms of assistance.   A Foreign Office press officer, who spoke on condition ofanonymity in keeping with British custom, said talks between Britishand Vietnamese officials were still going on and that the grantingof British development aid to Vietnam was dependent on thewithdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia.   The press officer added: ``We have nothing to announce on theoutcome of those talks yet.''   Robert van Leeuwen, head of the U.N. High Commissioner forRefugees in the colony, said he has not been informed of anagreement between Britain and Vietnam.   Van Leeuwen also said a group of Vietnamese officials wouldarrive in Hong Kong on Wednesday night to interview 300 boat peoplewho have volunteered to return to their homeland instead ofremaining in detention centers in the British colony.   So far, 143 boat people have returned to their country under aprogram of voluntary repatriation. Another group is expected to flyback in about one month, the U.N. official said.   He added that there were indications the number of boat peoplevolunteering to return home is increasing.</TEXT></DOC>
