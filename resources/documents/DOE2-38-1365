<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-38-1365 </DOCNO><TEXT>A diagnostic complex created for measuring the electron temperature anddensity at the TM-4 device is described. The complex comprises a probingbeam injector and a detecting unit. The injector is a heavy ion (single-chargedcesium ions) beam accelerator. The detecting unit comprises a multigridelectrostatic particle analyser by the energies and a detector-a secondaryelectron transformer. The method space resolution was measured within1.5-0.5 cm interval under Cs ion energy change from 100 up to 30 keV.4 refs.; 4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
