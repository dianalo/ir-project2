AKRE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Exxon Corp. and the operator of thetrans-Alaska oil-pipeline terminal could face fines exceeding $700million as a result of the nation's worst oil spill, a review ofstate and federal law indicates.   State attorneys have been monitoring the spill cleanup in PrinceWilliam Sound and collecting evidence of damages since the tankerExxon Valdez ran aground March 24, said Doug Mertz, an assistantstate attorney general.   More than 10 million gallons of crude oil leaked from thetanker, killing fish, marine mammals, birds and other wildlife overa 3,000-square-mile area, and affecting the livelihoods offishermen and others who live in the region.   Exxon Corp. and Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. are the twocompanies that likely will bear the brunt of the state and federalgovernments' legal attack.   ``They're certainly the principal players,'' Mertz said Friday.   Exxon owns the tanker through a corporate division, and alsoowns the oil. Alyeska, a consortium of seven oil companies, ownsand operates the pipeline terminal where the tanker took on itsload of oil.   Both companies were responsible for the initial spill response,which has been attacked by government officials andenvironmentalists as slow and ineffective.   Alaska's legal ammunition includes several laws that provide forhefty fines against companies responsible for polluting theenvironment.   For large spills, the state can assess a $1- to $10-per-galloncivil fine regardless of fault. It is automatically multiplied byfive in cases of ``gross negligence'' or when spill damagesincrease because of poor cleanup response, Mertz said.   A complex formula determines the fine, based on how damaging thespill is to the environment. Mertz said the maximum civil fine forspills in a marine environment such as Prince William Sound is$2.50 a gallon. The $10-a-gallon fine applies only to seriousdamage in freshwater, fish-bearing streams.   However, it is possible the top fine could apply to the ExxonValdez spill. The state would have to prove the oil had damaged anyof the dozens of freshwater streams that feed the sound, Mertz said.   If the maximum fine and the ``automatic multiplier'' wereapplied, the oil companies could be assessed more than $500million. The fine would be spread among the liable parties, Mertzsaid.   The state also can seek compensation for damages to naturalresources, including those damages that cannot be measured, and forthe state's costs of containment and cleanup, he said.   Another state law allows for a civil fine of up to $100,000, andthe state can seek additional damages under federal environmentallaws. It also is possible the state will seek to recover lostoil-royalty income, Mertz said.   Mertz declined to speculate how high the state fines couldtotal, noting the issue could be appealed in court.   ``I would not even come close to hazarding a guess,'' he said.``The totality of natural resource damages is so difficult tocompute. It can be done but it requires a lot of expertise andtakes a lot of time.''   Mertz estimated it could take six to 12 years to resolve theliability issues and fines in court.   ``Spills of this magnitude take years and years to get to trial.It's just impossible to predict what way it will go,'' he said.   Ann Prezyna, an attorney with the U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency in Seattle, said most federal fines would arise fromviolations of the Clean Water Act.</TEXT></DOC>
