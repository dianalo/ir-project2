The Pentagon sources agreed to discuss the matter Monday afterthe Army released a brief statement announcing plans to produce ``anew model of the M-1A1 Abrams Main Battle Tank with significantlybetter armor.''   ``The armor design modification to the M-1A1 incorporatessteel-encased depleted uranium,'' the service said.   The development of the new armor has been under way for severalyears as part of a highly classified ``black'' program, the sourcessaid. The Army relaxed the classification somewhat on Monday onlybecause it had to provide information to production line workersand wanted to allay health concerns about using a radioactivematerial in a manned vehicle, they added.   In Monday's announcement, the service insisted that the depleteduranium would pose no threat to either the soldiers who operatedthe tanks or to the production workers who built them because ofthe manner in which the tanks would be fabricated.   ``Sealed within the tank, depleted uranium has a very low levelof natural radiation, which is well within the acceptable rangeestablished by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,'' the Army said.   ``You would have to sit on this tank for 75 hours straight inorder to get the same equivalent radiation as a single chestX-ray,'' added Maj. Phil Soucy, an Army spokesman.   The Abrams is made for the Army by the General Dynamics Corp. attwo plants _ in Lima, Ohio, and Detroit _ employing roughly 5,000production workers. The armor plates are being made at a secretlocation and then shipped to the assembly lines, the Army said.   Depleted uranium is an inert, heavy metal that is unusuallydense _ 2{ times more so than steel. The term ``depleted'' meansthe uranium does not have sufficient energy to be used forcommercial purposes such as in power plants.   Depleted uranium has long been used for a variety of civilianand military applications, ranging from the production of canistersfor the transport of more highly radioactive materials to certaintypes of ammunition.   In the case of the M-1A1, the Army refused to say how muchuranium would be incorporated into each tank; where on the tankbody the armor with uranium would be located, or how it wouldproduce the new armor.   The sources said, however, the new process involved ``weaving''a thread mesh of uranium into the regular steel armor plating atthe time of casting. The process produces an incredibly strongplate that adds ``an insignificant amount of weight,'' they said.   ``It's not only the strength of the uranium but the way it'sworked into the steel,'' said one official. ``The process is stillhighly classified and nobody's going to say more.   ``But the experts say this plating can stop any known Sovietanti-tank round, as well as any of their more advanced rounds indevelopment.''   The Army, in its statement, said, ``This improvement culminatesseveral years of research and development to meet recent andcontinuing improvements in Warsaw Pact anti-armor weapons and willallow the Abrams to meet the anticipated threat well into the1990s.''   The Army has already acquired about 1,500 M-1A1's and they willnot be retrofitted with the new armor, the service said. But theremaining 3,000 tanks scheduled for purchase will incorporate thenew armor.   ``The majority of the improved tanks will be stationed in Europewhere they can most directly contribute to NATO defenses,'' theservice said. The first should arrive ``late this year.''   Soucy said the new armor plating would begin showing up on thetank manufacturing lines early this summer. The first completedtank with the new armor will be delivered in October, the spokesmanadded.   Soucy declined to say how much the new armor would cost. EachM-1A1 currently costs about $2.36 million.</TEXT></DOC>
