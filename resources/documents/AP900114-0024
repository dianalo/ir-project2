(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A group of well-dressed hitchhikers was therewaiting when Rose McMurray pulled into the Rolling Valley Mallparking lot in search of the ``warm bodies'' that would enable herto use the express lanes on the interstate and get to work on time.   ``It's a win-win situation for everybody,'' McMurray says as shepiles two riders into her car. Drivers get to use thehigh-occupancy vehicle, or HOV, lanes, and cut 20 minutes or moreoff from their commute through mind-numbing traffic to downtownWashington, D.C. Passengers get a free trip.   Without government direction or subsidy, the informal, instantcarpooling system has evolved into a unique commuting mode thatrelieves pressure on the subsidized bus system, cuts congestion andsaves commuters money.   Transportation researchers call it the ``Springfieldunderground'' because it started with the opening 15 years ago ofHOV lanes down the center of I-395 to the Washington suburb ofSpringfield, Va. The two-lane HOV lanes are restricted to buses andcars carrying three or more passengers during rush hour.   Most carpooling involves people from the same office or the sameneighborhood or those matched by formal programs. But inSpringfield and the nearby bedroom community of Burke, it's standthere and take your chances.   The only other area where the instant carpooling occurs on alarge scale is at bus stops leading to the east entrance to the BayBridge between Oakland and San Francisco, according to a study bythe Urban Institute.   Arlee Reno, who heads transportation projects for the UrbanInstitute, said he has taken a slide show on Springfield'shitchhiking commuting system to Houston, Minneapolis, Seattle andLos Angeles.   But researchers caution that several conditions have to be metif such systems are to work. Among them:   _At least 500 commuters in the given area.   _HOV lanes that save enough time to give drivers a reason topick up passengers.   _A parallel bus system that gives hitchhiking commuters analternative if no cars show up.   One drawback of the system is the reluctance of people to climbinto a car with a stranger. But riders see little risk with threepeople in the car.   ``A requirement of two persons per vehicle in order to use theHOV lanes would undoubtedly result in a much higher level ofpsychological resistance to instant carpooling,'' Reno said in astudy of the Springfield system.   The ``Springfield underground'' has been so successful thatnearly all the spaces in park-and-ride lots along the route aretaken up by hitchhikers, ranging from stylishly dressed singlewomen to uniformed military officers heading for the Pentagon.   At one lot, surveyors watched 553 people get into cars withstrangers and only 25 board buses that pass by the lot. Driverscall out their destinations and the next riders in line pile in.   Ms. McMurray alternates between driving and hitching rides atthe mall, located about 20 miles southwest of downtown Washington.   ``All we need is warm bodies for the express lane,'' she says.   Dottie Cousineau, head of commuter programs for Fairfax County,said the system has freed morning buses for other areas.   Some riders also hitch rides in Washington to get home, but Ms.Cousineau said the system doesn't work as well because workers haveto get to limited pickup points, including ones near the WashingtonMonument and at the Pentagon.   Ms. Cousineau said she has never heard of a complaint about thesystem from a driver or a rider.   ``I guess it's because it's entirely voluntary,'' she said.   Instant carpooling has fostered a new riding culture andetiquette. The 30-minute rides may feature the unfriendly silencesmore common in elevators or, on the other hand, convivial commutesthat cover the gamut of political and social discussion.   On the morning after the U.S. invasion of Panama, a militaryofficer on his way to the Pentagon discussed the timing of theoperation. On another day in another car, an AgriculturalDepartment worker criticized farm subsidies.   But the most common topics are the weather and the difficulty ofgetting to work in the nation's capital.   For the commuter, a roundtrip between Fairfax County andWashington can cost as much as $6.80 a day _ $2.40 each way onbuses and the subway and $2.00 to park at a Metro station. With theride-sharing program, the trip is free for the passengers.   One private lot owned by a movie house was selling parkingstickers that included their value in movie tickets.   Drivers still have to pay for gas and downtown parking, but theyget to work faster.   Metropolitan transit officials like the system too, although busridership has decreased on the route.   ``More power to them,'' said Metro spokeswoman Marilyn Dicus.``We all have the same goal _ to get more than one person in avehicle.''</TEXT></DOC>
