Three main types of pitting have been identified, but asfor the causes and the mechanisms these have not yet been fully clarified.Through case studies, model experiments, thermodynamic calculations,and service tests, evidence has been obtained that waters having a pittingpropensity for copper pipes can be made less corrosive by an increaseof the HCO/sub 3//sup -/ content. On water treatment the following watercomposition should be aimed at: A pH value of at least 7, and HCO/sub3//sup -/ content of at least 70 mg/l, preferably 100 mg/l, as low SO/sub4//sup -/ content as possible, or at least lower than the HCO/sub 3//sup-/ content (both in mg/l).</TEXT></DOC>
