Or will Soviet economicmiseries add to Germany's own problems, further slowingEurope's economic locomotive?   International fund managers are deeply divided on suchquestions -- and for good reason: The German market's futureis one of the most perplexing puzzles to investors anywhere.Depending upon whom you talk to, the market could explode ineither direction. And no matter which direction you choose,an analyst said, there is reason to be nervous.</LP><TEXT>   The closest thing to a consensus among professionals isthat recent events in the Soviet Union further confirm thatGermany's economy will play a dominant role in the newEurope's future. But agreement is elusive about whetherGerman securities are a bargain at current prices, whetherthe big payoff will come within a few years or a decade, orwhether investors should fret about next week's headlines.   Unsettling questions extend from whether the Soviet Unionand its republics can prevent an economic collapse and massemigration, to how much financial and technical aid will beprovided by Western democracies and at whose expense. TheGroup of Seven industrial nations are discussing how to helpthe Soviet Union, but a major cash infusion isn't expected.   To a German fund manager for an insurance group, suchuncertainties and the recent turmoil warrant a moreconservative view of the German market. On Aug. 19, the fundmanager said, he was in semishock after the attempted Sovietcoup erased 10% of his 700 million-mark ($402.8 million)portfolio. &quot;Thank God the market gave it all back,&quot; he said.&quot;But let me tell you, it was a bitter lesson.&quot;   He concluded that even with the promise of quicker Sovieteconomic reforms, his fund's 80% investment in the Germanmarket left him overexposed to potential effects of furtherchaos in the Soviet Union, as well as to Germany's problemsin digesting unification costs.   Last Friday, the DAX stock index in Frankfurt closed at1646.18, after having returned recently above its pre-couplevel of 1653.33. &quot;Now we're seeing some exaggerated Sovieteuphoria, but it can't last,&quot; the fund manager said, addingthat he is talking with U.S. and Japanese banks to diversifyhis portfolio a bit.   To be sure, few investors outside Germany have such a highpercentage of their assets tied up in German securities. Someinternational fund managers are even scaling back Germanholdings in favor of less volatile and more predictablemarkets.   Nevertheless, the German market is nearly 50% capitalizedby foreign investors. Its recent gyrations gave furtherevidence that investors see Germany's market prospects tiedclosely to developments farther east.   Germany's export economy depends on the Soviet Union forless than 3% of its trade. But its government and banksaccount for roughly one-third of the Soviet Union's $60billion in Western debt, and Germany's geographical proximitymakes it appear vulnerable to a possible invasion ofrefugees.   Douglas Johnson, a Merrill Lynch international equitiesstrategist in New York, said, &quot;Any disruption to creditarrangements, transportation and trade could have a strongimpact on German companies.&quot;   In addition, uncertainty has been lingering, particularlyabroad, about Germany's own economic restructuring and itsburdens of heavy borrowing, high interest rates, slowinggrowth and unemployment in the east. &quot;It's too early to gointo Germany. They haven't felt the pain yet,&quot; said GraemeKnox, managing director for Scottish Amicable InvestmentManagers Ltd. in Glasgow. He is looking at the Japanesemarket instead.   Merrill Lynch has &quot;underweighted&quot; its German shareholdingsin its international portfolio at a 3.5% rating, rather thanthe 4% that would reflect the German market's world valuationratio.   In London, James Capel andamp; Co. asset managers indicated theybelieved German equities were overvalued even before theSoviet coup attempt. The company has again trimmed its Germanequity holdings.   In the 1990 unification boom, German stocks leaped toall-time highs before collapsing, as the complexities andsoaring costs of rebuilding eastern Germany became moreapparent. The DAX index finished the year down 29% from itsMarch 1990 highs. Since then, German stocks have clawed theirway back, rising nearly 20% since Jan. 1 as more investorslooked beyond current problems and focused again on potentiallong-term benefits.   For some economists, this view is enhanced by possibleSoviet reforms that could speed trade in Europe. Yet Germaninflation pressure and growing public spending deficits arelikely to keep German interest rates high and burden capitalmarkets for at least another year. Most market participantsare pessimistic about the German bond market's prospects.   Equities could benefit as government spending continues totranslate into subsidized orders for German industry,investors said. And Western aid to the Soviet Union, when itcomes, also could pad order books in western and easternGermany.   Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., among others, is sticking to thislonger-term perception, and despite short-term risks expectsthe German market in the next year to outpace other Europeanbourses. Morgan Stanley has lifted its European portfolio'sGerman weighting to 27.5% from 22.5%.   Specific recommendations of German stocks often differ asmuch as opinions on the overall market. Analysts mainly aretargeting the so-called perestroika stocks, the majorconstruction, engineering, electrical and steel shares thatwere already boosted by anticipation of reconstructioncontracts from the former East bloc. Others prefer companieswith close production links to the Soviet Union, as well asbanks, which could benefit from new trade financing with theEast.</TEXT></DOC>
