Jim Flanigan, a Peace Corps spokesman in Washington, said PeterGiaquinta was ``fine as far as we know.''   In Boston, the brother of Peace Corps volunteer BettyjeanBouffard, 27, said Thursday she called her relatives to say she wassafe. The call, said Dave Bouffard, was the first news the familyhad had of her safety.   ``We're ecstatic,'' he said, adding that his sister had beenliving with a Nepalese family five miles from the earthquakeepicenter.   Flanigan said the Peace Corps has been able to track down allbut three of the 157 volunteers in Nepal. There are no Peace Corpsmembers in India, he said.   The three, he said, are from Michigan, Wisconsin and thePhiladelphia area; he declined to release their names.   ``We have a problem with roads out, monsoon rains,'' Flanigansaid. ``In the best of times, reaching some of these volunteers isseveral days.''</TEXT></DOC>
