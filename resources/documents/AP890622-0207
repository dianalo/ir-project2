In addition to the resolution urging the high court to reconsiderWednesday's decision, a variety of bills aimed at circumventing theruling were tossed into legislative hoppers.   ``Congress has believed that the act of desecrating the flag isclearly not `speech' as protected by the First Amendment,'' said theSenate resolution, co-sponsored by Majority Leader George Mitchell,D-Maine, and Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.   The resolution, which passed 97-3, voiced alarm that the rulingmay invalidate federal law and statutes in 48 states prohibitingdestruction of the flag.   Sens. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Howard Metzenbaum ofOhio, both Democrats, and Gordon Humphrey of New Hampshire, aRepublican, voted against the resolution.   Kennedy said the Supreme Court ``has the last word on the meaningof the Constitution'' and that the Senate shouldn't go on recordcriticizing the Supreme Court for carrying out its duty.   Humphrey said that while he didn't like anyone burning ordefacing the flag, he asked, ``What defines desecration?''   ``This seems to me to be an exercise in silliness and a littlebit of hypocrisy,'' he said. ``It strikes me as intellectuallydishonest.''   The high court, in a 5-4 vote, threw out the conviction ofGregory ``Joey'' Johnson, who was sentenced to a year in jail andfined $2,000 for burning the flag in Texas.   The court said the flag burning at a demonstration in Dallasduring the 1984 Republican National Convention was a form ofexpression protected by the Constitution's guarantee of freedom ofspeech.   The decision was greeted with virtually universal outrage onCapitol Hill.   ``Shame on these judges,'' said Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind. ``Shameon you, shame on you!.''   ``We must stand for America. The flag, the flag. America,America. For us!'' bellowed Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.   ``The First Amendment guarantees everyone the freedom to speak,but it guarantees no one an audience for his words,'' said Mitchell,a former federal judge. ``I do not believe that Americans have tosee the flag, that symbolizes their freedom to speak, devalued andcheapened in the cause of preserving that freedom.''   ``The act of flag burning is not meant to convey any politicalidea,'' said Rep. Robert Dornan, R-Calif., who was among thoseintroducing legislation to amend the Constitution to prohibitflag-desecration. ``It is an act that is solely meant to provoke andoffend.''   ``With this decision, the court cloaks the most offensivebehavior as political expression,'' said Rep. Owen Pickett, D-Va.,who introduced a resolution aimed at nullifying the court decision.   Rep. Doug Applegate, D-Ohio, shouted on the floor of the House:   ``I'm mad as hell. We've witnessed the greatest travesty in theannals of jurisprudence, when the Supreme Court allowed thedestruction of the greatest of American symbols. What in God's nameis going on?''   Rep. Les AuCoin, D-Ore., said he was ``deeply offended'' by theruling.   ``The Reagan court has given us ... constitutional protection forthe burning of Old Glory,'' he said. ``This liberal Democrat says,`For shame!'''   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said he was disappointed with the ruling.   ``In my view, the American flag represents the pre-eminent symbolof our republic and all for which it stands,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
