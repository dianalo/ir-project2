COLEMAN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Women should not throw out their thyroidprescriptions even though a commonly prescribed hormone may causesome long-term thinning of the bones, a doctor says.   The most commonly prescribed thyroid hormone, L-thyroxine,previously had been considered safe when taken over a number ofyears, says a study in today's Journal of the American MedicalAssociation.   But 31 young women treated with L-thyroxine for at least fiveyears were found to have 10 percent to 13 percent less bone densityin their hips than 31 women in a comparison group matched for ageand weight, the study said.   Loss of bone mass, also called osteoporosis, is usually mostserious in women after menopause and is largely to blame for thehip fractures that afflict one-third of women who reach age 90, thestudy said.   But one of the authors cautioned that the study is onlypreliminary and ``we don't know, and we are not suggesting, thatthese very small changes in hip will be associated with anincreased fracture rate.''   ``We are not saying thyroid hormone should not be used becauseit causes bone loss,'' said the co-author, Dr. Lewis E. Bravermanof the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester.   ``We are saying the dose of L-thyroxine should be carefullyadjusted to the individual need of the patient, which can now bedone with sensitive new assays,'' he added in a telephone interviewThursday.   Before new tests were developed about two years ago to measureprecise blood levels of L-thyroxine, marketed as Levothroid andSynthroid, doctors were more likely to prescribe excess levels,Braverman said.   Most of the millions of patients who take it must take itindefinitely to counteract the hormone deficiency created by anunderactive thyroid gland, thyroid cancer or a condition known asgoiter, an enlargement of the thyroid that leads to a swelling ofthe neck.   Hypothyroidism causes body functions to slow down and, ifuntreated, can lead to a deterioration in the person's physical andmental health. The problem can become so severe that simple mentaltasks, such as adding up a bill, take longer.   ``One of the risks in something (a finding) like this is youhave people say, `I'm going to stop taking my thyroid so I won'tget osteoporosis.' That's disastrous,'' Braverman said.   But an editorial accompanying the study in the journal suggestedthat doctors may need to rethink their approach to treating thyroidhormone deficiencies.   ``Is it appropriate to treat a benign thyroid problem with amedication that potentially could cause osteoporosis?'' asked theeditorial, by Dr. David S. Cooper of Johns Hopkins UniversitySchool of Medicine in Baltimore.   ``The whole concept of suppression therapy for benign thyroiddisease may need re-evaluation, especially in older women, whoseskeletons are the most likely to be in jeopardy,'' he said.   The study found no loss of bone mass in the spine, the doctorssaid. Spinal bone loss can cause the reduction in height and backcurvature that mark advanced cases of osteoporosis.</TEXT></DOC>
