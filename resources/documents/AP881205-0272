(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Eastman Kodak Co. Monday announced thedevelopment of a new computer chip that it claims will vastlyimprove the quality of electronically-generated photos.   The chip was immediately hailed as an advance in the race withthe Japanese to integrate photographic technology with computers.   Industry analyst Jacques Kauffmann said the chip dramaticallyimproves the clarity of electronically-generated images and mayshorten the time it takes to make that technology available toconsumers.   Kodak has made its fortune in silver halide photography, atechnology that requires an image to be captured on film.   But since the early 1970s, it has been working on electronicphotography, which captures images on a computer disk that convertsthe image into electrons.   Companies that are working on electronic photography haven'tmarketed it widely to consumers because they haven't been able todevelop a sensor with enough picture elements, also called pixels.The more pixels, the sharper the picture, so few pixels has meantmediocre picture quality.   The sensor that Kodak introduced Monday has 4 million pixels,twice as many as the best available up to now.   Kauffmann said the picture quality of 4 million pixels iscomparable to the quality of prints from 110 film. Kodak spokesmanTimothy Hughes said it is 11{ times the quality of a camcorder imageand twice the clarity of high-definition television pictures.   Last spring, Japan's NEC Corp. and Toshiba announced a2-million-pixel prototype. The best available before that wasKodak's own 1.4-million-pixel sensor, introduced in 1986. Thepicture quality of a 1.4-million-pixel image is comparable to thatof Kodak's disc camera, Kauffmann said.   But he cautioned that there is a big gap between commercial andconsumer applications.   ``It's far from being a consumer level product,'' Kauffmann said.   Kodak has said that its main thrust right now is to continue todevelop its conventional film so the picture quality stays ahead ofelectronic photography. Its top-of-the-line Ektar film, introducedin October, is evidence of that effort.   And Hughes said the cost of this 4-million-pixel sensor makesconsumer applications prohibitively expensive. He said Kodak won'tdiscuss the sensor's cost until next spring.   When the prototype becomes available early next year, followed byproduct introduction in the middle of the year, Kodak expects abouta dozen customers from science, government and industry to beinterested, Hughes said. He said customers probably will use thetechnology to take an electronic picture of a photograph so they canlook at it on a computer screen and transmit it to other computers.</TEXT></DOC>
