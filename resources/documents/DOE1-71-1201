These &quot;ideal&quot; conditions are often deviatedfrom in the typical borehole and to correct them, most service companiespublish a set of charts giving the appropriate correction for their toolsfor different borehole conditions. In the article presented, equationsto make these corrections are given along with a discussion of a programto calculate them on a personal computer. A crossplot program for theAmiga personal computer is also given.</TEXT></DOC>
