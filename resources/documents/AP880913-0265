Under the agreement, Colgate will receive $910 million in cashand $50 million worth of debentures from a company formed byKendall management and the investment banking firm Clayton andamp;Dublier.   In addition, Colgate said it would retain certain Kendallassets, including real estate and some overseas non-health careconsumer products businesses.   It estimated the entire deal to be worth around $1.1 billion, aprice that was in line with expectations of private industryanalysts.   Colgate, which put Kendall on the auction block last spring,said the transaction would result in an after-tax gain of more than$200 million.   Colgate Chaiman Reuben Mark said the Kendall sale would enablethe company to focus on its vast array of global consumer products.   ``It (Kendall) is a fine, well-managed company, but as thebusiness does not fit in with Colgate's long-term strategic focus,the sale will enable us to concentrate all of our attention onworldwide consumer products opportunities,'' Mark said.   Among Colgate's products are Fresh Start, Fab, Dynamo and Ajaxcleansers; Colgate and Ultra Brite toothpastes, and Irish Springand Palmolive soaps.   Other operations include Princess House crystal and Hill's petproducts.   The Kendall unit manufactures and supplies disposable medicalproducts, such as surgical dressing and bandages and intravenoussolutions, to hospitals and health-care facilities in 61 countries.Its best-known consumer product is its Curity bandage brand.   Kendall, with more than 10,000 employees worldwide, accountedfor around $850 million of Colgate's $5.6 billion in revenue lastyear.   Clayton andamp; Dubilier is a private New York-based investment firmthat specializes in management-led leveraged buyouts, in which acompany is acquired largely through borrowed money repaid from atarget company's profits or asset sales.</TEXT></DOC>
