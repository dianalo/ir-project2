(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The nation's lawmakers are sidestepping crucialdecisions on when life begins and when it should end despite medicaladvances on both issues, a judge told a conference of doctors,judges and ethicists.   ``The other branches of government by and large refuse to accepttheir responsibility,'' Washington, D.C., Superior Court JudgeGladys Kessler said Friday. ``These issues do not have a consensusin society.''   She said apparently lawmakers believe that ``the waters are tooturbulent'' to take strong stands on the life-and-death issues.   Kessler told the National Judicial College Bioethics Conferencethat most laws nationwide say the state ``has an absolute right topreserve life.'' But few laws have been passed that take intoaccount fine legal distinctions that have developed as people livelonger and survive illnesses that would have killed them just adecade ago.   ``How can we avoid the harder and most emotion-laden issue of thequality of life?'' she asked some 150 conferees from across thecountry.   Chief justices nationwide were invited to send two judges to theconference at the nation's premiere school for judges on theUniversity of Nevada, Reno campus.   Twenty national organizations, including the American MedicalAssociation and the National Bar Association, also were asked tosend two delegates each to the meeting.   ``We wanted to hold the conference because these issues must bediscussed to come up with some answers that judges can take back totheir states,'' said Thomas Russell, associate dean of the college.``The courtroom usually is the place of last resort for thesemedical-ethical issues to be resolved.''   Ms. Kessler was joined Friday by Ruth Purtilo,ethicist-in-residence at Massachusetts General Hospital, inexplaining to conferees the latest bioethical dilemmas.   ``Everybody's thinking about ethics these days ... it's almost anational pastime,'' Ms. Purtilo said. ``We have a complete societythat's worrying.   ``We all are in a new neighborhood of thought, of deliberations.People are living longer and surviving longer because of medicaltechnology. ... It's the stuff of science fiction, but it's here.''   Ms. Purtilo told doctors and judges they must not only considermedical facts surrounding the case, but also review what's best forpatients, families and, in some cases, the unborn.   In doing that, Ms. Purtilo warned that often there would be morethan one wrong and one right answer to a dilemma and judges anddoctors would be forced to make such life-and-death decisions``under terrible pressures of time.''   ``We as a society have to understand that the patient's voicemust be heard,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
