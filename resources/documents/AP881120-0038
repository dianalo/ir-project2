Jumonville Jr., aDemocratic state senator from Ventress, La., told a news conference.``It's a major part of our economic survival.''   Ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countriestried in a third day of closed-door talks to resolve a disputebetween Iraq and Iran that has been delaying work on a newproduction agreement.   The accord would limit the amount of oil each of the 13 OPECcountries could produce in an attempt to limit breakneck productionthat has caused a glut and sent prices downward.   Oil Minister Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria, the cartel's president,said a proposal was on the table, but he gave no details.   ``The discussions are continuing,'' said Sheikh Ali KhalifaSabah, the Kuwaiti oil minister. ``We are here to find a solution.''   The negotiations preceded Monday's start of the cartel's wintermeeting.   Jumonville and other representatives of U.S. energy-producingstates met with OPEC members to appeal for price stability.   The 12-member delegation represents the South-West Energy Counciland the Interstate Oil Compact Commission. Members of the delegationare from Louisiana, Arkansas, Texas, Oklahoma and Alaska.   Texas Railroad Commissioner Kent Hance told reporters he wantedto have ``a dialogue with people that have more say on the Texaseconomy than anything that's decided in our state capital or ournational capital.''   The plunge in prices in 1986 badly damaged the economies of U.S.oil states. There is concern a recent fall in prices could lead toanother downturn.   ``We feel that our economy in Texas is starting to turn around,but if oil prices went to single-digit numbers, it would stop usfrom having a turnaround,'' he said.   The officials said if prices rose to $18-$20 a barrel, it wouldhelp their economies.   ``It wouldn't be a boom for us, but it would allow us tosurvive,'' Hance said.   The December contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarkgrade of U.S. crude oil, settled at $13.60 a barrel on Friday.   OPEC maintains a benchmark price of $18 a barrel, although Arabcrudes have been running about $10 a barrel.   The recent weakness in prices has been blamed partly OPECproduction that has surged to its highest monthly level in fiveyears.   The current output accord, worked out in 1986, sets total OPECoutput at about 15 million barrels a day. But total cartelproduction in October was estimated by the International EnergyAgency at nearly 21.1 million barrels.   The accord covers only 12 members because Iraq refused the dailyquota of 1.5 million it was assigned, insisting that it be raised tothe 2.4 million given its bitter enemy, Iran.   Since the two countries agreed to an August cease-fire in their8-year-old war, efforts have been made to return Iraq to the quotasystem.   Formal talks between the two OPEC committees _ price evolutionand long-term strategy _ began Thursday.   Cartel members are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United ArabEmirates and Venezuela.</TEXT></DOC>
