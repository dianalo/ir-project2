One New Jersey farmer has been asked to repay $100,000 after afederal agent read AP reports that checks went to corporations andfarmers ineligible for disaster aid. Entire counties in Californiaand New Mexico are being investigated as well, according to theAgriculture Department.   The AP found that the program became a one-time windfall forthousands of farmers outside drought areas whose losses were due tonormal quirks of nature. Claims were approved for such commonperils as insects, sand, wind, cold and fungus, even ``ineffectiveherbicide'' _ all of which were outside the bounds of the droughteffort.   Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., a member of the House AgricultureCommittee, called the AP series ``a needed story'' and saidCongress must try to establish safeguards to prevent problems infuture agriculture disaster programs.   ``We have to set up some structures,'' Roberts said. ``That'swhy I think the AP series and other examples have been verybeneficial. They point up the road we should not take.''   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said his department'sOffice of Inspector General probably will investigate the 1988relief program and likely will study the AP series, which appearedin December.   ``The fact is, these kinds of programs are exceedingly difficultto administer, and they have inherent shortcomings,'' said Yeutter,who was interviewed recently at a wheat growers' convention inTexas. ``It's not that people avoided their responsibilities orwere cavalier in the implementation; it's simply that it's just notan ideal way to deal with this problem.''   The Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, the armof the Agriculture Department that administered the program, isalready checking specific misdeeds spotted by the AP, deputyadministrator Dan Shaw said in Washington, D.C.   The ASCS says, however, that it won't check beyond the 22counties in eight states the AP examined in its investigation.   ``Those few that I was concerned with, we are checking to makesure corrections will be made,'' Shaw said.   Shaw said other counties won't be studied because ASCS officialsdon't believe serious problems exist nationwide. ``I think (the AP)did a pretty good job,'' he said. ``I think you came up with thesame problems we were having administering the program.''   But Dennis Pryslak, the New Jersey lettuce grower who wasordered to repay the aid he received, said it's unfair to singlehim out just because he was mentioned in an AP story.   ``There's 50,000 other guys out there in the same situation andwe got caught,'' said Pryslak.   Yeutter said he hoped to avoid future big-buck bailouts, eitherby improving the federally subsidized crop insurance system orcreating a permanent, efficient disaster program.   ``We simply cannot afford a combination of the two,'' Yeuttersaid. ``The combination of mousetraps that we're using to deal withnatural disasters in this country is not a very desirablecombination.''   If Congress chooses to finance disaster programs rather thansubsidize crop insurance, the Agriculture Department will go backand examine the problems the AP found, he said.   ``One could put in place permanent disaster legislation thatwould be a potential substitute to crop insurance,'' Yeutter said.``Once the administrative system was put in place, we wouldn't havethe kinds of problems that were cited in your articles, or at leastthey'd be dramatically minimized.''   The AP stories appeared amid an intensifying debate inWashington over the value of crop insurance vs. year-to-yeardisaster relief. Earlier this month, Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kansas,senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, renewed his callto strengthen crop insurance and clean up excess in farm disasterprograms.   ``We were begging for disaster help for Kansas wheat farmers(last year) and there were other senators fighting for thewatermelon and pickle growers,'' said Dole spokesman Walt Riker.   ``What he's saying is, let's clean up crop insurance and make itattractive for farmers to participate in. Let's not have thesewhole programs where the country is paying for `ginseng rootrelief,''' Riker said.   Ginseng root was among the many crops eligible for disasterassistance in 1988.   Indeed, the AP study, conducted over seven months, found thatpayments went far beyond the initial intent, supported by almosteveryone, to save Midwestern grain growers from bankruptcy. Growerscollected on everything from kiwi fruit in California to Christmastrees in Connecticut. Checks were written for rain-bloated tomatoesin New Jersey and washed-out bird seed in Colorado.   Rep. Kika de la Garza, chairman of the House AgricultureCommittee, defended the disaster relief program and contended thebenefits to truly drought-stricken areas were ``camouflaged'' byabuses found by the AP.   ``Legislation at best is an imperfect endeavor,'' de la Garzasaid. ``Therefore there are those (mistakes) that for one reason oranother fall through the cracks. That always happens when we dolegislation in an emergency situation.   ``I would have liked to have taken more time. I would have likedto have done more study. But there was no time. Something needed tobe done.''   Some problems the AP found, such as farmers ``triple dipping''by collecting disaster aid, crop insurance and growing areplacement crop all on the same acreage, were corrected in the1989 relief program, de la Garza said.   The House committee, de la Garza said, will look into thereported abuses and ask the Agriculture and Justice departments tosee if fraud or other illegal acts were committed.   ``Already, from word of mouth, we've been looking,'' de la Garzasaid.   Two weeks ago, the ASCS asked Pryslak to return his $100,000 inassistance within 30 days. The AP had reported that his businessexceeded the $2 million revenue limit, disqualifying it from thefederal program.   Pryslak, who has appealed the decision, said he gave the localASCS office correct information and asserted he was paid throughthe agency's misinterpretation of the rules.   ``If I knew about the $2 million ceiling, I wouldn't have takenthe money,'' he said.   Peter DeWilde, the ASCS director for New Jersey, said errorswere made on both sides.   ``He didn't give us some information and some information wedidn't ask for,'' he said. A determination of Pryslak's appeal isexpected by the end of February.   ``Sometimes the rules are hard to interpret, and then sometimesthe rules are changed on us,'' DeWilde said. ``We welcome anychance to make sure these people deserved to be paid.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, Jan. 22</NOTE></DOC>
