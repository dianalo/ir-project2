The Soviets would have a greater ability than the United Stateseither to break out of any such treaty or to illegally hideweapons, according to the study by the panel's defense policysubcommittee.   The report was released Wednesday, shortly after PresidentReagan left for Moscow for his fourth summit meeting with Sovietleader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   One of the agenda items at the summit is the proposed StrategicArms Reduction Treaty, which tentatively provides for reductions ofup to 50 percent in each nation's arsenal of long-range atomicweapons.   U.S. officials say they are aiming for a START treaty that wouldleave each side with 6,000 long-range nuclear weapons. But manydifferences remain to be resolved.   The treaty would be a successor to a separate pact eliminatingmedium-range nuclear weapons. The Senate is currently consideringthe Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty.   ``No START agreement will come out of the summit next week andthat's good,'' said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the ArmedServices Committee. ``There is a great deal to be done before armscontrol policy and weapons system decisions are harmonized.''   The report called the 6,000 figure ``an illusion'' because ofthe proposed methods for counting nuclear weapons. For example, abomber would be counted as a single weapon, even though eachairplane could carry numerous nuclear bombs and missiles.   ``Almost 3,400 more Soviet weapons could be `legal' under theprospective agreement,'' the report said. ``Thus, a force of nearly9,400 Soviet weapons could be legally available under START.''   However, it noted, the same rules would apply to the UnitedStates. ``In fact, because the United States has more bombers, itwould probably end up with more legal weapons. Thus, the actualceiling on weapons under START is more like 9,000-10,000 on eachside rather than 6,000,'' the study said.   In addition, the study said, the treaty would be extremelydifficult to verify, opening up possibilities for cheating.   The report also noted a key difference between the proposedSTART pact and the medium-range treaty. The medium-range missilepact bars flight testing of missiles such as the SS-20s. Supportersof medium-range treaty say the ban means that if the Soviets arehiding some SS-20s, the missiles would quickly degrade and be oflittle military value.   But no such ban is proposed by the START deal. ``So the militarycapability of any concealed forces will not decline over time,''the study said. That would give the Soviets incentive to cheat.   The report also said that for political reasons, the Sovietscould find it easier to break out of START reductions.   ``Given the history of U.S. strategic arms development, it seemsunlikely that the president would propose such a course (abreakout) or the Congress approve it. A U.S. planner, however,could not rely upon internal checks and balances in the SovietUnion.''   Given those uncertainties, U.S. military planners should worryabout a ``Soviet force not of 6,000 weapons, but of many, manymore,'' the study said.   It concluded that maintaining the current doctrine of deterringnuclear war with the threat of overwhelming retaliation willrequire building the right type of U.S. nuclear force, even underSTART restrictions.   That force should include a number of relatively ``low value''targets, such as single-warhead, land-based missiles, which arewidely dispersed. Such weapons are harder to hit, and thus increasedeterrence, when compared with ``high value'' weapons like the10-warhead MX and the huge Trident missile-firing submarines, thestudy said.   But, the report said, ``the administration continues to deployfewer and bigger weapons platforms even as it pursues a STARTagreement that favors smaller and more delivery systems.''</TEXT></DOC>
