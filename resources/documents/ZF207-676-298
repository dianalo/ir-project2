(DISC) hasannounced several products for DBL Synergy, the company's business softwaredevelopment language that integrates 3GL and 4GL capabilities, according tocompany officials.andM;Chief among the new products is DBL Synergy Information Control System (ICS),which allows programmers and end users to combine, exchange and integratedata from differing file types.andM;Other products that the company is releasing include the DBL SynergyDeveloper's Toolkit, version 2.0; DBL Synergy Configuration Management System(CMS); DBL Synergy File Interfaces; and Down to Earth Business Systemsversion 3.andM;&quot;We call ICS a 'superpowers' product because it enables users to have thepower to reach into proprietary file structures, grab whatever informationthey want and do whatever they want with it, such as merging different filetypes, for instance,&quot; said Beth Callahan, the company's marketing manager.andM;&quot;We think it will be a big hit once people realize what they can do with it.andO;You can integrate data from an Oracle database with Lotus 1-2-3 and then witha Down to Earth accounting file.andP;  You can also include up to five differentfile types in one report,&quot; she added.andM;ICS utilities consist of a data dictionary that controls the creation andmaintenance of data structures, data tools that include import, export,merge, purge and data-loading capabilities, and a report writer that allowsdevelopers and end users to write ad hoc reports, company officials said.andM;Simultaneous AccessandM;Data from DBL-ISAM, C-ISAM, Pro-ISAM, Btrieve, Oracle and ASCII files can besimultaneously accessed and manipulated, officials added.andP;  The product alsoallows for data export and import from dBase II, III, IV and Lotus 1-2-3files, officials said.andM;&quot;Even diferrent departments within the same company may use different kindsof proprietary databases, and then when they want to do a joint report, it'salmost impossible.&quot; Callahan said.andM;&quot;Because the report writer is simples enough to be an end-user product, allof the files are listed in a pull-down menu, for instance, and you highlightthe ones you want,&quot; she added.andP;  Right now, we only do eight major file types,but we'll be adding others later.&quot;andM;Version 2 of the Developer's toolkit allows developers to easily incorporatepulldown menus, pop-up windows, hot keys and user-defined soft keys intotheir applications.andM;Version 2 also offers utilities for menu processing, text editing and inputwindow processing with full field definitions.andP;  The product includes anEDT-compatible, fullscreen DBL Synergy Editor.andM;The new version of Down to Earth Business Systems, the company's accountingand business modules, has now incorporated the user interface of theDeveloper's Toolkit into five modules.andP;  Another eight modules will be addedbefore the end of the year, Callahan said.andM;The Synergy CMS product is made up of Polytron's Version Control System andPolyMake utilities, which give users control over source-code configurationand documentation.andM;All of the changes, revisions and versions of an application are documentedwith this software.andM;The utilities automatically invoke the complier, linker and other tools torebuild a system when modules change.andM;DISC's versionof CMS makes the Polytron product fully compatible with VMS andwith all types of Unix, including Ultrix, Xenix and AIX, Callahan said.andM;The DBL File Interfaces are sets of object modules that can replace DBL-ISAMroutines in DBL run time so that developers can opt for interfaces such asOracle's Call Interface, Novell's Btrieve or the C-ISAM interface.andM;&quot;There are people who want to use our language but already have a great dealof investment in other file types,&quot; Callahan said.andM;&quot;This allows them to develop an application in Dibol but use Btrieve, forinstance, instead of ISAM,&quot; she added.andM;ICS, CMS and the file interfaces are available now.andP;  The Developer's Toolkitis also available now.andP;  ICS, the file interfaces and the Developer's Toolkitrange in price from $625 to $2,025.andP;  CMS is priced at $5,550 for a singleuser and $800 per user for multiuser systems.andM;Additional information can be obtained by contacting Digital InformationSystems Corp. at 11070 While Rock Road, Suite 210, Rancho Cordova, CA95670-6099, (916) 635-7300.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
