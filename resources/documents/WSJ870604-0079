Gen. Richard Secord and a $200,000 &quot;benefit&quot; for Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North -- are now privately invested in London.    Records released by House and Senate committees investigating the controversy indicate Gen. Secord has never withdrawn any of the funds allocated to him. But Mr. Hakim contradicted the retired general's claim that more than $520,000 transferred separately to their Virginia-based company was merely a loan.    &quot;I don't refer to them as loans,&quot; said Mr. Hakim of the payments, which include $370,823 transferred from Switzerland in a period corresponding closely with the time of U.S. arms sales to Iran.    Mr. Hakim, an Iranian-born businessman and partner of Gen. Secord, said he couldn't recall whether he informed Col. North of the $200,000 set aside in May 1986. He denied that he intended to compromise the officer, who helped to oversee the administration's Iran and Contra operations from within the National Security Council.    &quot;Ollie, you are a part of the family as long as one of us is alive,&quot; Mr. Hakim recalled telling Col. North during one of their meetings. The businessman revealed that he separately had explored, through his Swiss attorney, assisting in the education of the officer's children.    Appearing under a grant of limited immunity, Mr. Hakim gave the most detailed testimony yet about the disposition of funds from the Iran-Contra operation, for which he managed bank accounts and corporations in Switzerland, Panama and Liberia.    The disclosures about the division of profits added to the controversy surrounding the roles of Gen. Secord and Col. North in the secret operation, in which the administration repeatedly relied on private individuals and companies to veil its involvement.    Mr. Hakim's testimony came as Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams ended a two-day appearance, during which he was repeatedly accused of misleading Congress. He emerged from the session with his credibility severely damaged. &quot;The object here is not to avoid a perjury indictment . . . the object is to make the Constitution of the United States work,&quot; House panel Chairman Lee Hamilton (D., Ind.) told the 39-year old State Department official.    Members of the panels wavered between anger at Mr. Abrams and sympathy for the embarrassments he has suffered. Influential lawmakers believe he has become an added burden to the administration as it seeks to preserve its Central America policy.    Mr. Abrams, denying he is a &quot;fall guy,&quot; insisted, &quot;I am, and plan to be, assistant secretary of state.&quot; But the administration yesterday convened a meeting of senior officials to discuss Nicaragua while the assistant secretary was testifying on Capitol Hill. Administration sources said the session of the Senior Interagency Group on Nicaragua was scheduled earlier this week, when officials knew Mr. Abrams couldn't attend. &quot;That's a clear sign that Elliott is gone,&quot; said one official.    As Mr. Hakim testified, the committees released financial documents related to the Iran-Contra operation. They show that the Nicaraguan Democratic Force, the dominant Contra group, paid corporations controlled by Gen. Secord and Mr. Hakim a total of $11.4 million for arms from 1984 through July 1985.    An additional $34.9 million came to the &quot;enterprise&quot; in the 17 months ended last December. The bulk of this second infusion of funds came from U.S. weapon sales to Iran, but the total included donations earmarked for the Contras -- including $1.8 million from private donors in the U.S. and $2 million from Taiwan.    Mr. Hakim's testimony was most revealing in explaining how the operation handled an estimated $9.6 million in profits generated from the Iran and Contra operations. Gen. Secord's share of profits made on the sale of weapons to the Contras -- and ultimately in one case to the Central Intelligence Agency -- was estimated at $1 million. The retired general has testified that he renounced any earnings, but Mr. Hakim continued to make deposits, and the account, held in London in the name of Korel Assets, has since grown to nearly $1.6 million, according to a recent accounting.    An almost equal partner in the arms-supply operation was Thomas Clines, a controversial former CIA officer. He received $990,003 through a second front company, C. Tea, devised by Mr. Hakim as a play on his associate's initials.    Mr. Hakim said he established a third account, designated Belly-Button, to hold the $200,000 intended for Col. North. Mr. Hakim said the deposit, made in May 1986, was partially conceived as a &quot;death benefit&quot; of sorts for the officer if he were killed in a trip to Tehran that same month.    The businessman's own interests were best defined by two other accounts -- one held in the name of Sci-Tech Trading Group, a foreign affiliate of his Virginia partnership with Gen. Secord, and the second in his own name. Sci-Tech is listed as receiving $605,984, while the remaining funds, about $6.8 million, went into the account held by Mr. Hakim.    The businessman acknowledged that he has drawn at least $700,000 in personal profits and benefits from the undertaking, but the $6.8 million total overstates his share. He said that figure included $2 million initially set aside as self-insurance on planes used to ship arms to Iran, and another $2 million which also was committed to the operation -- including money for payments to businessmen and Iranian officials, who weren't identified.    All but Mr. Clines's account remain under the management of a Geneva, Switzerland, attorney and associate of Mr. Hakim's, Willard Zucker, who appears to have consolidated the holdings when the operation was revealed last fall. The bulk of the money was moved to the U.S. briefly, according to investigators but has since been transferred to London, where it is held at the Toronto Dominion Bank.    Mr. Hakim, who a few years ago admitted in a deposition that he had arranged to funnel millions in payoffs to military officials in the Shah's Iran, testified that his attempts to help Col. North financially were prompted by fondness for the official and concern for his family. He described Col. North as &quot;torn apart&quot; by love for his family and country.    He said he had wanted to set aside $500,000 for Col. North but that Gen. Secord objected to the amount. He said Gen. Secord didn't approve the $200,000 figure but also didn't raise any objections.    Mr. Hakim also said he instructed Mr. Zucker to contact Mr. North's wife, telling her that an unnamed admirer wanted to help with the educational expenses for the North children. He said Mrs. North subsequently met with Mr. Zucker and his Philadelphia attorneys, and that Mr. Zucker sought information on the North family structure to see if he could funnel money through relatives, but couldn't &quot;find a proper way to do it.&quot;    Mr. Hakim said Mr. Zucker later proposed putting Mrs. North on the payroll of a real estate company. The company would be reimbursed out of the Belly-Button account, but Mr. Hakim said this plan also wasn't implemented.    &quot;I did not absolutely have the intention of compromising Oliver North in any way or form,&quot; Mr. Hakim insisted. He said that in providing funds to the North family, he would have acted anonymously, so he couldn't be accused of influencing Col. North. Described by former associates as a charming and cunning businessman, Mr. Hakim said he knew it wouldn't have have been lawful for him to make a gift to a U.S. official with whom he was dealing.    In the case of the $2 million set aside for self-insurance on planes, documents released by the committees showed that if Mr. Hakim died, Gen. Secord would take control of the money. In the event of Gen. Secord's death, Col. North would assume control but Mr. Hakim said he never told Col. North about the arrangement. </TEXT></DOC>
