But Mr. Bensusan is convinced that before it's over, therewill be loss of life. &quot;We'll see some kind of militaryaction&quot; soon, he believes, because &quot;violence is a pattern forthe area.&quot; And he worries that here at home, the crisis willprovoke a recession.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Bensusan's comments mirror the opinions and emotionsof American voters sampled in a new Wall Street Journal/NBCNews poll. The scientific telephone poll was supplemented byface-to-face interviews, which show that Americans' supportfor President Bush is stalwart -- and their pessimism aboutquick success in the operation deep-seated.   Overwhelmingly -- by 72% to 16% -- Americans continue toback Mr. Bush's handling of the confrontation in the MiddleEast, almost three weeks after Iraq's lightning seizure ofoil-rich Kuwait. By almost the same margin, they approve ofhis decision to send military forces to Saudi Arabia and thePersian Gulf. And more than two-thirds of them say they arewilling to see those Americans fight under any of the mostlikely scenarios.   At the same time, these voters entertain no notions thatany of this is going to be easy. They believe that the U.S.holds the upper hand so far. But a plurality, 42% of them,believe the U.S. will end up in a war with Iraq.   And in a rapid shift unusual in polling history, Americansnow conclude, 57% to 26%, that there will be a recession inthe U.S. sometime during the next 12 months. Only a monthago, Americans believed by a lopsided 49% to 25% that therewouldn't be one. This extraordinary turnaround, occurring ata time of surging gasoline prices, is clearly a result of theunfolding events in the Middle East.   &quot;So far, the public is pretty much of one mind. They'veconcluded we've done the right thing and they back thepresident by a large margin,&quot; say Peter Hart and RobertTeeter, who conducted the poll for the Journal and NBC.   Besides backing the general Bush approach, Americansappear willing to commit U.S. forces to battle, particularlyif U.S. security or American hostages are at stake. If Iraqwere to invade Saudi Arabia, 74% of the poll's respondentswould support military action. Nearly as many would support acombat role for American forces if Iraq imprisons ormistreats Americans living in Kuwait. And 61% say they wouldsupport an invasion of Iraq itself to try to force therelease of the hostages.   The pollsters say they rarely have seen a survey where theAmerican public supported committing military forces tobattle before the fighting had actually begun. &quot;If there is ashort message being sent to Iraq's Saddam Hussein,&quot; thepollsters say, &quot;it reads: `Don't mess with us.'&quot;   Thus, President Hussein's efforts to divide Americanpublic opinion clearly aren't working; this poll wasconducted 2 1/2 weeks after the crisis began Aug. 2, meaningthat unlike earlier surveys, this one permitted respondents achance to think things through. &quot;This is a reflective opinionvs. the earlier reflexive opinions,&quot; say Mr. Hart, aDemocratic pollster, and Mr. Teeter, a Republican.   But Americans are less inclined to go to war with Iraqover economic questions, even over matters so critical asSaudi Arabian and Kuwaiti oil. If the price of gasolineshould surge to $2 a gallon, only 27% say the Americanresponse should be military action.   &quot;That's not worth fighting for,&quot; says Linda Nidetz, a34-year-old part-time legal secretary from Glenview, Ill.&quot;We've had gas shortages before.&quot;   &quot;The American voters are being very discriminating,&quot; thetwo pollsters agree.   Normally, Americans pull together, at least initially,when their troops are committed to dangerous missions abroad.President Reagan scored high marks for intervening in Grenadaand Mr. Bush for ousting Panama's Manuel Noriega.   But those patriotic surges can sour if the news from thebattlefield is bad, or if the conflict shows no signs ofcoming to a successful conclusion. Vietnam, of course, is themost searing example, one that continues to burn in the mindsof Americans. &quot;After Vietnam, I can't think of hardlyanything that's worth starting a war over,&quot; says AnnetteBurt, a 40-year-old airline employee from Linden, N.J.   But a more apt comparison may be President Truman'sintervention in 1950 to prevent South Korea from beingoverrun by North Korea's powerful army.   The American army then fought under a United Nations flag,with U.S. Allies giving the effort limited support.Initially, according to historical Gallup poll data,Americans supported defending South Korea by 65% to 20% --not so different from their current feelings about Kuwait.But as the North Koreans overran the Allied troops, sentimentchanged. In just four months, between September 1950 andJanuary 1951, opinion turned around even as the news wasgetting better -- until half of the American public concludedit had been a mistake after all. Dwight Eisenhower waselected president in 1952 on his implied promise to end theKorean fighting.   So far, the President's strategy of Middle Eastintervention wins the support of a broad range of Americans-- men and women, older and younger, Democratic andRepublican. Pollsters Teeter and Hart note that 62% of thewomen responding support sending troops to the Middle East(and 68% support the president's handling of the crisis).   The one exception is blacks. Only 41% (against 74% forwhite voters) approve of sending combat forces to the MiddleEast.   Priorities also are a concern to Delia Realmo, ahigh-school history teacher in Chicago's predominantlyMexican-American Little Village neighborhood. &quot;We have ahealth-care crisis, a measles epidemic and things the rest ofthe country doesn't even think about,&quot; she says, expressingreservations about the use of force in the Middle East.   Americans who support Mr. Bush rarely express doubts aboutthe mission itself. Nancy Calhoun, a 46-year-old townsupervisor in Blooming Grove, N.Y., notes that she has a sonserving as a Navy pilot. &quot;That's why my son is there {in theNavy}; it is a stand for democracy and a stand for theworld,&quot; she says.   &quot;I'd throw the H-bomb at them,&quot; says Jerome Cummisky, a79-year-old retired real estate and insurance agent fromMadison Lake, Minn.   But there is an undercurrent, both in the poll and in theinterviews, that this operation won't be an easy one toconclude successfully. While approving the concept, peoplewonder about the execution.   &quot;I think the worst is perhaps ahead of us,&quot; says GaryPatton, a 46-year-old lawyer in Santa Cruz.   &quot;It's really a scary, scary situation,&quot; says PamelaJenkins, 35, an office supervisor at Burnside Coal andamp; Oil inthe Bronx borough of New York City. &quot;I think a guy who usedchemical warfare on his own people just doesn't value humanlife, and that may get us into terrible trouble.&quot;   &quot;I think it's going to escalate to an armed conflict,&quot;says Robert O'Leary, a 36-year-old insurance salesman fromWalden, N.Y. &quot;Our hostages are history.&quot;   In the poll, Americans are almost evenly divided onwhether they think the crisis will lead to combat, 42% sayingit will and 40% expecting the U.S. to achieve its objectivesshort of war.   By the same token, people are somewhat doubtful thateconomic sanctions and a blockade will enable the U.S. toachieve its objectives, with 43% saying those actions willwork and 37% saying they won't.   They tend to support some options a lot more heavily thanothers. Calling up National Guard and Reserve units winsbroad approval, with more than three-quarters in support.Blockading Jordan, if it doesn't go along with economicsanctions, is popular too, with 59% in support.   What happens to American hostages clearly will be a majorfactor in framing public opinion. Americans feel so stronglyabout this that 61% say they would support invading Iraq --an immense military challenge -- to force Saddam Hussein tofree Americans.   But while an overwhelming majority would agree to aninvasion of Iraq for this purpose, a much smaller majoritysupports the idea of cutting off food to Iraq to the pointthat innocent civilians would go hungry. Black voters, again,part company, with only 37% supporting the idea of shuttingdown food supplies to Iraq, compared with 58% of whites insupport.   Americans worry about the hostages abroad; at home, theyworry about a recession.   Pollsters Teeter and Hart say they are stunned by theturnaround in economic opinion, with 57% of Americans nowbelieving there will be a recession in the next 12 months.   &quot;The economy's been teetering on the edge for some time,and this crisis will probably put the economy over the edge,&quot;says Jim Lufty, who owns a card shop in Traverse City, Mich.   Pessimism about the economy is widely distributed.Pollsters find that black voters tend to be more pessimisticabout the direction the economy is going than white voters,but in this poll white voters are just as pessimistic.   And when it comes to assigning blame for the surge ingasoline prices, there is little doubt in these people'sminds. U.S. oil companies are blamed by 70% of therespondents -- and Saddam Hussein by only 13%.   ---   Contributing to this article were Wall Street Journalbureaus and five newspapers of Dow Jones andamp; Co.'s Ottawaychain: the Record-Eagle of Traverse City, Mich.; the FreePress of Mankato, Minn.; the Times Herald-Record ofMiddletown, N.Y.; the Herald of Sharon, Pa., and the SantaCruz Sentinel of Santa Cruz, Calif.   ---   Do you approve or disapprove of the job George Bush isdoing in handling the conflict inthe Middle East?
