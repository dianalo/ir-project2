 Because Lexperdse is based in Switzerland, it has aready market for such products.andM;MacProof 2.0 and 3.0 were developed by Automated Language Processing Systems(ALPS), a Utah-based company specializing in interlanguage translation.andP;  In1986, ALPS opened a subsidiary in Switzerland.andP;  Several employees of thesubsidiary, including its director, left ALPS in the spring of 1988.andP;  Theyset up Lexpertise in Switzerland and bought die codes and rights to ALPS'swriting products, including MacProof.andP;  Later that year, an employee of theALPS office in Utah left to establish in that statc a Lexpertise office thathandles North American marketing.andM;PC Proof ($159) runs on any EBM PC or compatible computer.andP;  It can checkfiles from WordPerfect 4.2 and 5.0 and Microsoft Word 3.0 or greater, as weUas ASCH files.andP;  We have not seen PC Proof, which is scheduled for a Julyrelease, but Lexpertise told us that it runs die same checks as MacProofandM;MacProof ($195) requires a Macintosh Plus or better with at least 1 MB ofmemory, and it runs best ftom a hard disk.andP;  The current version of MacProofworks with Microsoft Word 4.0, MindWrite, MacWrite 4.6 and 5.0, MacWrite IIand PageMaker 3.0.andP;  Other Macintosh word processors are &quot;text-compatible &quot;butnot&quot; format-compatible; for them, you must either run MacProof beforeentering any formatting Commands or else print a copy of the document andthen mark changes there as you run MacProof.andM;We tested MacProof, which immediately stands out because it is convenient.andO;As a Macintosh desk accessory, it can be run from within any word processor.andO;You merely choose MacProof ftom the desk accessory list, highlight the textyou want analyzed (a minor annoyance if your word processor lacks a &quot;selectall&quot; feature), and pull down the MacProof menu and choose &quot;Select Checks&quot; or&quot;Run Checks.&quot; We would appreciate a display showing how much of thc text hasbeen processed.andM;MacProof has the best spelling checker of these programs.andP;  when it finds aword that is not in its dictionary, it displays a fist of possiblesubstitutes in the order of likelihood.andP;  This list, based on the number ofcharacters that match those in die flagged word, outclasses alphabeticallists such as Grammatik III's, and it provides a beter selection than doesCorrect Grammar's spelling checker.andP;  Both the speUing checker, which contains116,000 words, and the usage checker, which has 10,000 entries, areuser-modifiable.andM;You can edit words m the text window whether or not tey are flagged.andP;  Byclicking on words, you bring them into the &quot;replace with&quot; window, where youcan edit them.andM;MacProofs greatest flaw is its lack of took for assessing readability.andP;  Itcalculates only a few statistics, and those are poorly figured.andP;  The &quot;countsand averages&quot; screen told us that one document had 20 sentences in 7paragraphs, an average of 2 sentences per paragraph.andP;  Bad rounding, we say.andM;Even if the counts and averages were rehable, they would be worthless,because Lexpertise gives no guidance about &quot;proper&quot; or &quot;normal&quot; counts andaverages.andP;  The most ludicrous piece of advice we found in any of thesemanuals is in MacProofs: &quot;If you are unsure of what these averages should be,find a few pieces of writing that you think are appropriate to your audienceand analyze them with Counts and Averages.&quot; Theres something to be said fornot imposing one's ideas on the customer, but freedom of thought can becarried too far.andM;The other displays it offers, such as highlighting thc first word of eachsentence or displaying the first and last sentence of each paragraph, havesome value.andP;  They fall far short, however, of the statistics and indicesprovided by MacProofs competitors.andM;Results.andP;  MacProof flagged about as many mistakes and a many &quot;innocentsuspects&quot; as its competitor on the Mac, Sensible Grammar.andP;  There was noobvious pattern to MacProofs hits and misses.andP;  It flagged two suspects thatno other program marked: the possibly sexist term &quot;Gentlemen&quot; (sentence 1)and the incorrectly capitalized word &quot;Airport&quot; (sentence 8).andP;  It missed twosuspects that most of its competitors caught: starting a sentence (#10) with&quot;But&quot; and the phrase &quot;The reason why...is because&quot; (sentence 9).andM;This program holds promise, but it needs enhancements, particularly inreadability analysis.andP;  MacProof must be bolstered before some of the leadingPC granunar checkers are ported to the Mac later this year.andP;  We hope that thecompany's resources will permit further development of both its multilingualand its (American) English-language programs.andM;@@0074201441 0SRDHEd017RPSR Scandinavian PC Systems' Readability Plus differsimmensely from its competitors.andP;  It does not check grammar or usage, butonly, as its name implies, the ease of reading a document.andP;  It offers thelargest variety of analyses, some of which are had to grasp.andP;  And it adds aproprietary &quot;mortar and bricks&quot; rating to the three more common readabilityindices.andM;Its analyses give you good advice on how to improve your document.andP;  However,readability tests alone are less valuable than even the current level ofgrammar checking.andP;  A document written with reasonably good grammar and usage,even if it contains too many long words and long sentences, is easier tocomprehend than one din scores well on the bricks-and-mortar test butcontains poor grammar and incorrect usages.andP;  Besides, most grammar-checkingprograms also offer some standard readability tests.andM;Readability Plus ($94.95) runs on IBM PCs or compatible computers with DOS2.0 or later, 256 KB of RAM and a 360K floppy drive; it nms better with twofloppies, a hard disk or a color monitor.andP;  It works with WordPerfect,Microsoft Word, WordStar and WordStar 2000 files and with ASCH files.andP;  RolandLarson, a rehabilitation engineer in Sweden, designed Readability (dieoriginal version of this program) for writers who want to produce &quot;readable&quot;documents.andP;  That does not unply grammatically correct ones.andP;  It means textthat is riot weighted down with too many long words or long sentences.andP;  Italso means a relatively high ratio of &quot;mortar&quot; (the most common words) to&quot;bricks&quot; (less coff unon words).andP;  Such considerations as these seem overlysimple, but they can tell a lot about how to improve a piece of writing.andM;Larson contributed to the manual an often arcane discussion of themathematics behind his analyses.andP;  His arguments and equations make goodsense.andP;  This is not a program for the computerphobe.andP;  It is for someone whowants information and who will work to get it and to understand it.andP;  Seeingthe results.andP;  Readability Plus reports its analysis results in the form ofnumbered displays.andP;  The first one to appear graphs each sentence; the numberof long words (those with more than six letters) is on one axis, the numberof words in the sentence on the other.andP;  A clearly defined area of the graphshows the range of acceptable sentences for the style of writing you havechosen (see the picture).andM;This area changes as you select different writing styles from a list of nine,which range from &quot;newspaper article&quot; to &quot;advertising copy&quot; to &quot;novel.&quot; Forinstance, a piece intended to be read by children should have a smallerproportion of long words per sentence than should a newspaper article.andO;Readability Plus changes its analyses to reflect the chosen writing style farbetter than does any grammar checker.andM;&quot;Deviant&quot; sentences, which faU outside the recommended range, are probablyinappropriate for the specified type of writing.andP;  The program wiU teU youwhich sentences those are; it is up to you to look them over and considerrevising them.andM;Other displays (which you select by typing their numbers) contain informationsuch as Fog, Flesch, Flesch-Kincaid and &quot;LIX&quot; (a variation of Gunning's FogIndex) scores; graphs showing how easy or difficult to read the document is,based on those scores; some esoteric conclusions regarding the locations ofyour sentences on the initial length-vs.-long-words graph; statistics onoccurrences of consecutive short words (good) and consecutive long words(less good); and suggestions for making the document more readable.andM;Mortar and bricks.andP;  The program's rating of &quot;mortar&quot; vs.andP;  &quot;bricks&quot; isthought-provoking.andP;  Readability Plus compares the document to three lists of&quot;mortar&quot;: the seven words that make up about 20% of a typical text (&quot;the&quot;alone accounts for nearly 7%); the roughly 450 words that make up about 60%;and the roughly 2,600 words that make up about 80%.andP;  Any word not on thislist is a &quot;brick.&quot;andM;The more &quot;bricks&quot; within a sentence of a certain length, the harder thereader must focus on that sentence, and therefore the harder the text is toread.andP;  The writer can improve thc document's readability by merely adding&quot;mortar&quot; or, preferably, by replacing unnecessary &quot;bricks&quot; with &quot;mortar.&quot;andO;This concept of using lists of common words is popular in education andoflier areas,andM;Not seeing the results.andP;  Although Readability Plus creates files from theanalysis results, they are not viewable in the sane way as, say, theGrammatik III .SUM file.andP;  After viewing many screens of charts and commentsfrom within the program, you discover that the three results files it createsare essentially gibberish.andP;  They contain the statistics and sentence framentsfrom whkh the program constructs its analysis screens.andM;A lack of separately accessible results would hurt less if you could easilyprint the analyses.andP;  You can print information about either sentences withmany consecutive long words or &quot;deviant sentences&quot; (those whose combinationof length and number of long words do not fit into the profile of your chosenwriting style).andP;  Otherwise, though, you can only use the PrtSc key, whichdoes not always produce clear results.andM;Conclusions.andP;  Readability Plus is helopful to the writer.andP;  And it is moretechnically advanced at what it does than the grammar checkers are at theirtask.andP;  Although it is not as helpful as a grammar checker that also performsreadability tests, it offers good analyses that the other programs lack.andM;Scandinavian PC Systems has picked a strange niche to fill, but ReadabilityPlus fits it well.andP;  Still, this program should be viewed as a complement to agrammar checker rather than as a full-fledged writing aid.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
