The two organizations -- the Japan Federation of Bankers Associations, which represents the country's 87 commercial banks, and the Association of Trust Banks, which represents all major trust institutions -- will screen applications for real-estate loans in an effort to determine whether the money would be used to promote building projects based on genuine demand or to acquire property for quick resale as part of the country's mushrooming real-estate speculation. Loans deemed for speculative purposes will be denied, said the official, who is a member of the bankers' federation.    &quot;When we get a loan application,&quot; he said, &quot;the first thing we'll do is determine actual demand. If the money will be used to erect a building, this is acceptable, but not if it goes toward holding empty property that will be resold.&quot;    Land prices in Tokyo's choicer residential and business districts have surged more than 100% over the past two years. Other urban areas also have been affected.    The official said the value of loans outstanding from the federation's 87 banks to real-estate dealers or commercial entities totaled 30.2 trillion yen ($198 billion) at the end of March, representing 11% of total loans outstanding from the country's commercial banks.    Rumors of impending restrictions on funds available for real-estate speculation had circulated for the past two weeks.    The Japanese central bank's governor, Satoshi Sumita, has said that soaring real-estate, stock and bond prices, combined with fast growth in Japan's broadly defined money supply, have stirred concern that inflation will accelerate. Yesterday, Mr. Sumita said the central bank will continue to urge commercial banks, &quot;through day-to-day contact,&quot; to exercise moderation in lending.    The increase in speculative real-estate dealings has stemmed in part from five cuts in the central bank's official lending rate since the start of 1986. The speculation is one reason why central-bank officials are reluctant to ease credit further. </TEXT></DOC>
