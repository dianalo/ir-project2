Asa result of extensive cracking in BWR pipes caused by intergranular stresscorrosion, a program of augmented inspection and leak testing has beeninstituted. Emphasis is placed on returning such piping to original designconformance either by replacement with non-susceptible material or bya combination of stress improvement and environmental control. As a resultof a number of degradation mechanisms in steam generator tubes, inspectionand criteria for plugging or sleeving have been instituted along withbroad recommendations aimed at an integrated program for resolving steamgenerator tube problems.</TEXT></DOC>
