But they deadlocked on the explosive issue of space-baseddefenses and failed to take steps to cut concentrations of Easternand Western troops in Europe.   ``We have missed a chance to take an important step forward,''Gorbachev told reporters.   While accusing Reagan of ``incomprehensible maneuvers'' onconventional forces, Gorbachev also registered a lack of progressin settling a long-standing dispute over the U.S. Strategic DefenseInitiative.   He said he had proposed an exchange of data and cross-visits tofacilities where technology for an anti-missile defense is tested.But he said the problem remained in the path of a new treaty and afifth summit meeting at which it would be signed.   At a glittering ceremony in the Kremlin's St. Vladimir's Hall,though, Reagan and Gorbachev signed documents to put their 1987treaty to ban intermediate-range missiles in force.   Reagan called the accord a ``first step toward a brighterfuture, a safer world,'' while Gorbachev declared ``the era ofnuclear disarmament has begun.''   The Soviet leader said he and Reagan had agreed at their fourthsummit meeting that ``the immediate task before us'' was tocomplete the START treaty to sharply reduce strategic nuclearweapons. ``It can and must be accomplished,'' he said.   Future American and Soviet leaders cannot reverse course, the57-year-old Gorbachev said. ``I don't think anyone can close thatbook and put it aside.''   Reagan agreed. ``We must not stop here,'' he said. ``There ismuch more to be done.''   He said a joint statement to be issued later in the day wouldreflect ``more progress has been made toward a strategic armstreaty in our meetings.''   As the two leaders put the unprecedented ban on medium-rangemissiles and monitoring program into effect, they set the set thestage for American and Soviet monitors to take up stations in eachother's lands to guard against cheating.   Two Senate leaders, Democrat Robert Byrd and Republican BobDole, told reporters the so-called INF agreement was a crowningachievement for Reagan. But both said he should move cautiously onthe more extensive strategic arms pact.   ``Let's not have a framework adopted that lock us in,'' saidDole, R-Kan.   Reagan and Gorbachev are expected to issue a joint communiquebefore Reagan's departure Thursday that, among other things, wouldnote progress that has been made in the U.S.-Soviet relationshipsince Gorbachev took the Kremlin helm in 1985 and Reagan ceasedcalling Moscow the ``evil empire.''   And despite the failure to reach a breakthrough in arms control,the two sides made some headway on a stubborn issue: how to keeptrack of each other's elusive mobile missiles in the event of a newaccord.   ``We think we have most of the elements,'' Secretary of DefenseFrank C. Carlucci said in a CBS-TV interview. ``We're presenting itto the Soviets. Some of the elements they've accepted.''   Colin Powell, the president's national security adviser, toldCNN that ``there's been quite a lot of convergence in U.S. andSoviet thinking on the verification of mobile missiles. So we`vemade progress.''   But, Powell said, ``not enough to say that the treaty is athand.''   Anf Carlucci said unless the Soviets stop trying to block theU.S. Star Wars program, ``obviously we can't get an agreement.''   The treaty the leaders are exchanging is the first in history toabolish an entire category of nuclear weapons. It was ratified lastFriday by the Senate and 17 hours later by the Soviet Presidium. Itbans all missiles in the range of 300 to 3,400 miles.   Byrd, who arrived here Tuesday with Dole to mark the Senate'sratification of the INF accord, said Reagan's ``discipline andstrength'' prodded the Soviets to negotiate the accord. ``I don'tbelieve anyone else could have done that,'' he said.   Dole called the treaty ``probably the highlight of his secondterm. It is a small step, but it is a step towards arms reduction.''   Gorbachev and Reagan had hoped to complete a vastly moreimportant treaty to reduce U.S. and Soviet armories of long-rangebombers, land-based missiles and nuclear submarines by 30 to 50percent, but disputes over verifying the pact and the Reagan's StarWars program spoiled the plan.   Instead, they separated out a single provision for advancenotification of missile launch tests. It was signed Tuesday. Theyinstructed their senior negotiators to make as much progress asthey could on the obstacles to a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty(START) and left open the possibility of a fifth summit meeting tosign it before Reagan leaves office in January.   Progress on the proposed START treaty came on a U.S. proposalfor verifying limits on mobile missiles and a compromise oncounting air-launched cruise missiles, said a senior U.S. official,who spoke on condition he not be further identified.   But no progress was reported on Star Wars, the main impedimentto a START agreement to cut to cut long-range weapons.   At the December summit, both leaders said they hoped to sign astrategic arms pact in Moscow, but talks stalled over Star Wars,mobile missiles, rules on counting cruise missiles aboardwarplanes, curbs on cruise missiles on submarines, and a U.S. callto phase out heavy Soviet SS-18 missiles.   Gorbachev expressed exasperation at the pace of the talks,although both sides said they hoped the treaty could be signed bythe end of the Reagan presidency.   Reagan said he would not bargain away Star Wars, formally knownas the Strategic Defense Initiative.   ``It's never been a part of the negotiations,'' said Reagan.   Because of difficulties in counting mobile missiles, the UnitedStates had wanted to ban them, although it is developing one, theMidgetman. The Soviets declined to get rid of their two mobilemissiles, the SS-24 and SS-25.   During the summit, American negotiators offered a proposal theyhad been working on for months, to restrict mobile missiles tocarefully defined geographical areas, dubbed ``garrisons,'' whichwould be monitored by on-site inspection as well as surveillancefrom spy satellites.   ``The Soviets reacted positively to our proposal,'' said a U.S.official, speaking not for attribution.</TEXT></DOC>
