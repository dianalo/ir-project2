When the sale is completed, Petro-Canada will be thecountry's second-largest publicly traded oil and gas concern,with assets in excess of C$7 billion, behind Imperial OilLtd.</LP><TEXT>   The company's preliminary prospectus, distributedyesterday, didn't disclose any information on the pricing ofshares. But the outline of Petro-Canada's operations,financing needs and the report of its first-quarter resultsled analysts to conclude that the shares are likely to bepriced at about five times cash flow.   Analysts estimated that Petro-Canada shares could bepriced at between C$15 and C$20, low enough to generateinterest in the offering and to ensure that future shareofferings will find buyers. The proceeds of the offer are tobe used to pay down some of the company's C$2.2 billion ofdebt.   Canada's two other large integrated oil and gas concerns,Imperial, which is majority-owned by Exxon Corp., and ShellCanada Ltd., a subsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell Group trade atabout seven times cash flow, analysts said. Both Imperial andShell also reported poor first quarters due to high crude oilcosts and low prices for their refined products in the highlycompetitive market.   Analysts said that while Petro-Canada's poor first-quarterperformance was the result of the same factors and is likelyto improve throughout the year, its future prospects aren'tas bright as those of Imperial or Shell.   Petro-Canada is one of the most active participants incostly frontier oil and gas exploration and development.Petro-Canada's 25% stake in the Hibernia offshore oil projectwill require an investment of C$1 billion over the next fiveyears, and won't start contributing to earnings or cash flowuntil 1996 or 1997. Most of Petro-Canada's other frontierassets aren't likely to contribute to earnings or cash flowbefore late 1995, analysts said.   In the meantime, the company has succeeded in expandingits conventional reserve base in Western Canada only byaggressively applying enhanced oil recovery techniques on 68%of its proved conventional crude reserves.   Wilbert Hopper, chairman and chief executive ofPetro-Canada, said previously that without equity capital,the company would have had to undertake major asset sales &quot;tostay out of debtor's prison.&quot;   The public offering is the first step in the Canadiangovernment's plan to sell its entire holding in Petro-Canada.   Petro-Canada has agreed not to issue more equity until theCanadian government has reduced its stake to 50%, or untilthree years have passed, whichever is earlier. In theprospectus, the company said it will continue to tap the debtmarkets, and detailed plans to raise C$750 million through acommercial paper issue to fund short-term requirements.   While the underwriters, led by Toronto-based RBC DominionSecurities Inc., didn't give a closing date for thetransaction, it appears as though the shares could be pricedand distributed by mid-July.   Petro-Canada is based in Calgary, Alberta. Among Canadianoil and gas concerns, it is the third-largest producer ofcrude oil and natural gas liquids, and the fifth-largestproducer of natural gas. It is Canada's second-largestrefining and gasoline marketing concern.</TEXT></DOC>
