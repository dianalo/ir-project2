Barry Jr., on charges they steered $3 million incontracts to friends.   Prosecutors alleged that some of the money in what theydescribed as ``a seamy web of corruption,'' ended up in Barry's1986 reelection campaign fund, but they didn't say how.   A source familiar with Barry's 1986 campaign, commenting oncondition he not be named, said the two indicted men organized anAtlanta fund-raiser for Barry's reelection bid. The indictment doesnot mention the Atlanta event.   David E. Rivers, who formerly served as director of the city'shuman services department, and John B. Clyburn, a prominentcontractor, were indicted on charges of conspiring to defraud thecity government by steering health services contracts to friendsand to a company owned by Clyburn.   Rivers, a close friend of Barry, also faces two counts ofagreeing to accept a bribe, while Clyburn has been charged withhelping to bribe him.   Barry said in a prepared statement, ``I should remind the publicthat an indictment does not automatically mean an individual isguilty.'' He added, ``I will have no further comment. ... My focuscontinues to be on managing the District of Columbia government.''   The charges come after a 21-month grand jury probe that followeda two-year undercover FBI investigation into the city's contractingprocedures.   If convicted of all charges, the two men could face maximumprison terms of 50 years.   ``This indictment alleged a seamy web of corruption, ofconcealment, of manipulation and of self-dealing by one of the mostsenior officials in the District of Columbia government,'' saidU.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens. ``The investigation is continuing... and a number of other issues remain in this case.''   Stephens alleged that both Clyburn and Rivers took ``about 10percent off the top'' in kickbacks for the 20 contracts andcontract extensions mentioned in the indictment.   He declined to elaborate on how much money might have beensteered to Barry's 1986 reelection bid, or whether the mayor or anyof his top campaign officials were aware of the situation.   Rivers was out of town Wednesday, his attorney John Mercer said.Mercer said before the indictment was announced that he was unawareof any pending charges.   The 49-page indictment charges that from 1983 through May 1987,Rivers and Clyburn influenced the city's contracting process tosteer both sole-source and competitively-bid contracts to theirfriends.   Rivers took a leave of absence from his city job in August 1987after he became a target of the investigation.</TEXT></DOC>
