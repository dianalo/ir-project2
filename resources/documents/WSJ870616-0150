The pact is with Sweden's Forsvarets Materielverk, or Swedish Defense Materiel Administration. Under the contract, Rockwell will provide 700 of the anti-ship missiles, launch systems and certain support equipment.    Rockwell officials said the contract was the first overseas production order for the armor-piercing Hellfire. It also represents the first surface-to-surface application of the missile, which U.S. Army and Marine helicopters primarily use as an anti-tank armament.    Rockwell, a defense and aerospace contractor, will be responsible for the manufacturing of the missile and control electronics. A.B. Bofors Co. of Sweden will assemble the missile and make certain parts, including the warhead. </TEXT></DOC>
