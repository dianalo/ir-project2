The removalof this exclusionary language allows these Commission officials to receivethe appropriate differential. The revisions also reflect changes in titlesand positions within the Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>January 27, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Mr. Michael Rhode, Jr., Assistantto the Chairman and Secretary, Panama Canal Commission, 2000 L Street NW.,Washington, DC 20036-4996 (Telephone: 202-634-6441) or Mr. John L. Haines,Jr., General Counsel, Panama Canal Commission, APO Miami 34011-5000 (Telephonein Balboa Heights, Republic of Panama: 011-507-52-7511).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Issuance of a notice of proposed rulemakingunder 5 U.S.C. 553 is not necessary because this final rule pertains onlyto personnel of agencies covered by these regulations. Section 1217 ofthe Panama Canal Act of 1979 (22 U.S.C. 3657), authorizes the head of thePanama Canal Commission to pay an overseas recruitment of retention differentialto eligible employees. In addition to the statutory requirements of theAct, agency regulations published at 35 CFR 251.31 (tropical differential)and 35 CFR 251.32 (Panama Area differential) contain requirements governingeligibility for the differentials. Bureau directors and heads of independentunits of the Panama Canal Commission, however, are not covered by eitherthe statute or the regulations due to the exclusionary language of 35 CFR253.8(d). The final rule reflects the Commission's desire that these Commissionofficials receive the appropriate differential as do other Commission employees.The final rule revises andSection; 253.8(d) to apply the provisions of 22U.SC. 3657, 35 CFR 251.31 and 251.32, except for andSection;andSection; 251.31(b)(4)and 251.32(b)(2) to bureau directors and heads of independent units. Accordingly,the bureau directors and heads of independent units may receive the differentialsubject to the same eligibility requirements as other Commission employees,except that these officials will not be subject to the provisions of andSection;andSection;251.31(b)(4) and 251.32(b)(2), which limit payment of the diffferentialto an amount which, when combined with basic compensation, does not exceedthe current rate of step 5, GS-17 of the General Schedule set out in 5U.S.C. 5332(a). In other words, bureau directors and heads of independentunits will not be subject to the step 5, GA-17 limitation, but rather,will receive, in addition to basic compensation, the appropriate differentialregardless of the amount of aggregate compensation. The final rule alsoapplies the provisions of andSection; 251.25 to bureau directors and headsof independent units. Section 251.25 defines basic compensation or therate of pay as the base salary plus the appropriate differential. Thisis significant for pay alignment purposes. The final rule also makes two revisions in 35 CFR 253.8(b)(1) to reflectcurrent position titles and alignment. To reflect the realignment of theChief Financial Officer position from the Commission Officer Group to theCommission Executive Group, that position is removed from 35 CFR 253.8(b)(1).The Chief Financial Officer is instead considered included in the categoryof bureau directors and heads of independent units covered by 35 CFR 253.8(d).The final rule also revises the title of the Secretary to reflect the currentdesignation of Assistant to the Chairman and Secretary. This is not a major rule for the purposes of Executive Order 12291 of February17, 1981. As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, it is hereby certifiedthat this rule will not have a significant impact on small business entities.<ITAG tagnum="85">List of Subjects in 35 CFR Part 253 </ITAG>Panama Canal Commission, Pay allowances and differentials, Personnel policy.For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 35 CFR Part 253 is amended asfollows: <ITAG tagnum="56">PART 253_REGULATIONS OF THE SECRETARY OF THE ARMY (PANAMA CANAL EMPLOYMENTSYSTEM)_EMPLOYMENT POLICY </ITAG>1.
