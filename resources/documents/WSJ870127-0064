BirnbaumStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 01/27/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GOVMTECONOMIC NEWS (ECO)CONGRESS (CNG)JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS)EXECUTIVE (EXE)SUPREME COURT (SUP) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   When House leaders were trying to fill vacancies on the Civil Service Committee earlier this month, there was one question they needed answered first: How do the candidates stand on what some of them called &quot;the important pro-family issue?&quot;    That issue was the pending salary increase for federal officials, and the families they referred to were their own. So firmly does the House leadership favor the pay boost, in fact, that final action on appointing new members to the panel, which will consider the issue, was delayed until the nominees agreed that they would support the raise.    The increase, which was proposed by President Reagan for a range of federal officials, would put an extra $12,100 in the pockets of most members of Congress, boosting their salary nearly 16% to $89,500. (Half a dozen congressional leaders would get more.) The decision to allow their paychecks to get fatter, particularly during this time of big federal budget deficits, entails one of the trickiest political calculations the legislators will face this year.    A strong case can be made that members of Congress and other federal officials are underpaid. Their salaries haven't nearly kept pace with inflation over the years and they can often double or even triple their income by leaving federal service to work for private industry. But as Rep. Buddy MacKay (D., Fla.) says: &quot;It's a terrible issue, a very intense issue.&quot;    A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll illustrates how little support there is among voters for a pay raise. Only 7% of those polled believe members of Congress are paid too little, while 50% of the respondents said the lawmakers already are paid too much. Another 37% think the lawmakers are paid about the right amount, and 6% weren't sure.    Other federal officials fared only slightly better in the public's estimation: 41% of the respondents believe presidential cabinet officials are overpaid, and 36% think federal judges are, too. Only 5% of those polled think cabinet officials aren't paid enough, and 8% think federal judges are underpaid.    Congress has the luxury of being able to duck the pay question but still get the raise anyway simply by taking no action -- and that is precisely what is expected to happen. The pay raise takes effect Feb. 4 unless both chambers of Congress vote to block it. Under orders from its leaders, the House is unlikely to take any action by then.    But that won't be the end of the fight. Several bills have been introduced in both chambers to deny the boost to members of Congress while letting it take effect for other federal officials, and efforts probably will be mounted throughout the year to roll back the lawmakers' raise. Those who worry about the political fallout will angle for a vote on the pay proposal so they can oppose their own raise.    There may be good reason for concern; the history of federal pay increases is littered with tarnished political reputations. The first pay-raise vote, in 1816, raised lawmakers' salaries to $1,500 a year from $6 a day. It resulted in a wave of electoral defeats that swept away nearly two-thirds of the House, including Rep. Daniel Webster of New Hampshire.    Opposition to the pending pay boost is coming from both the political left and right. Consumer advocate Ralph Nader and conservative leader Paul Weyrich have worked together to activate the public outrage, and have managed to flood congressional offices with thousands of protest letters. Mr. Nader says it is &quot;absurd&quot; to assert that legislators, judges and other government officials can't get by on a salary that is several times larger than what most other U.S. workers receive. The average family of four has income of about $33,000 a year.    Some members of Congress say they find it hard to justify such a self-serving proposition to their constituents. Others, such as Rep. Virginia Smith (R., Neb.), see support for a raise as hypocritical. She asks rhetorically how lawmakers can accept a pay boost &quot;at a time when we say we are focusing efforts on reducing the deficit and regaining control of federal spending.&quot;    Still others express disdain for the manner in which the raise will be allowed to go through without any vote by the members who would benefit. &quot;It looks like we're trying to sneak something through on the public,&quot; complains Sen. Charles Grassley (R., Iowa).    Back home, members encounter almost solid opposition to the raise. Sen. John Chafee (R., R.I.), who opposes the increase for lawmakers, tries to explain that judges deserve the increase by telling audiences: &quot;When you have 150 lawyers in the city of Providence who earn more than the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, something is wrong.&quot; But he says his constituents usually respond, &quot;The lawyers in Providence are making too much.&quot;    Still, a few leaders are willing to stand up for what they believe is due to them. Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.) says the proposed increase has merit if it is tied to stiff new limits on the amount of honoraria that members can keep from speeches to private groups -- a position also taken by Common Cause, the self-styled citizens' lobby. House Speaker James Wright (D., Texas) calls the raise &quot;warranted,&quot; especially since the president's proposal is far smaller than the $135,000 a year recommended for lawmakers by a special commission established to suggest salary changes.    The commission and other advocates of higher government salaries contend that, compared with jobs with equivalent responsibilities in private industry, federal officials are clearly undercompensated. The inflation-adjusted buying power of lawmakers' pay has fallen about 40% since 1969, they add. As a result, they assert, good people shun government service.    &quot;The job is worth more money; most (of us) can do better in the private sector,&quot; argues Rep. Robert Matsui (D., Calif.). Taking a public stand in favor of the raise, he adds, &quot;comes down to whether you're chicken or not.&quot;    Indeed, some members say even the $135,000 figure wouldn't have been out of line. Says Rep. Vic Fazio (D., Calif.): &quot;There are members of Congress who whisper it; their wives may shout it.&quot;    ---                 Pay of Top Federal Officials                               Current       President's                                Salary          Proposal    Vice President             $100,800        $115,000    Cabinet Officers             88,800          99,500    Chief Justice               111,700         115,000    Associate Justices          107,200         110,000    District Court Judges        81,100          89,500    Members of Congress         *77,400          89,500   *Congressional leaders receive higher salaries</TEXT></DOC>
