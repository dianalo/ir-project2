Officials inCalifornia are also looking into TCI's plan.;    &quot;It's a low-rent rip-off,&quot;said Peter Antonacci, a deputy attorney general in Florida. &quot;It's despicable.For a company this large to be employing this kind of tactic, it's as if theUnited States invaded Lichtenstein.&quot;;    Herschel Elkins, head of the consumerlaw section of the California Attorney General's Office, had not heard aboutTCI's marketing plan for the Encore channel -- which will show movies from the1960s-'80s, some of them R-rated -- until informed by the Mercury News.;   &quot;That clearly is in violation of California law, that's called a negativeoption,&quot; Elkins said. But he added that the practice is allowable if thecustomer signs a contract that specifically allows a negative option.;    Bookand record clubs are legal under that provision. Elkins is seeking moreinformation about the TCI plan before deciding if his office should take anyaction.;    Called 'customer-friendly';  TCI believes the marketing approachis legal. The company is touting the plan as &quot;customer friendly,&quot; the best wayto provide a low-cost, premium movie channel to the greatest number ofcustomers.;    To keep the price low, the number of subscribers has to behigh. Offering the new movie channel to only those who order it -- thetraditional way of providing movie channels such as HBO and Showtime -- woulddrive up the monthly cost because company crews must go out and de-scramblethe signal at each home, according to TCI.;    Jeff Smith, the Californiamanager of TCI, said only about 20 percent of cable customers order premiummovie channels. TCI expects 70 percent or 80 percent of its customers willkeep Encore.;    On the other hand, the company says, adding Encore to basiccable and increasing the base monthly charge would not be fair to customerswho do not want the service.;    &quot;This is not an attempt by the company totrick or deceive someone,&quot; Smith said. TCI has 400,000 subscribers in thestate.;    Customers will receive seven notices that will tell them they cancancel Encore. TCI will erase the charges through September and afterward givethe benefit of the doubt to the customers who want to cancel after the cutoffdate, according to Jerry Kashinski, a TCI attorney.;    &quot;We're actually thefriendly giant on this one,&quot; Smith said. &quot;We think they want the programmingand if they don't want the programming, we're going to take it away and notcharge them for it.&quot;;    The San Jose City Attorney's Office is researchingthe issue based on a complaint from residents, according to Assistant CityManager Nabar Martinez. Martinez is also concerned that customers who aren'tfluent in English may not understand they can drop Encore.;    A circuit courtjudge in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., started hearing Florida's civil lawsuit onWednesday. Antonacci believes it could encourage other states to challengeTCI.;    Decision expected today;    &quot;I think if this practice is put to astop in Florida, nobody else is going to roll over and play dead for thesewolves,&quot; said Antonacci, who added the Florida judge is expected to make adecision today.;    But TCI believes it is giving the customers what theywant. Smith said surveys showed 70 percent of them are willing to pay extrafor an inexpensive premium movie channel.;    Encore won't play &quot;drive-inclass movies,&quot; Smith said. It will features movies such as &quot;All That Jazz,&quot;&quot;Chariots of Fire,&quot; &quot;Zorba the Greek,&quot; &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; and &quot;Butch Cassidyand the Sundance Kid.&quot;;    The Florida lawsuit says Encore will make nudity,profanity and violence available to children.;    Kashinski said the Floridalawsuit raises first amendment issues.;    &quot;We philosophically disagree thatour customers need protection from anybody, our customers are smart people,&quot;Kashinski said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DENNIS AKIZUKI, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910531  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  745  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday May 31, 199100152158,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
