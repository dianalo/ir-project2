(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>ADA GROWING IN DOD, AND COMMERCIAL DP?andM;Five F-20s scrambled into the Mediterranean morning sky to meet four of Col.andO;Muammar Qaddafi's MIG 30s off the coast of Libya.andP;  Touted as the world's mostsophisticated fighter aircraft, each F-20 was the equivalent of a flying datacenter.andM;As the first MIG was targeted and locked onto by the automatic defense system(ADS) in preparation fir firing the deadly Kite missile, System Failure beganblinking wildly on the pilot console.andP;  Before one of the world's finestpilots could convert to manual, an older Russian missile blew him from thesky.andM;In less than 10 minutes two F-20s were in the water and the other three wereretreating.andM;Worse than the defeat at the hands of Qaddafi's pilots was the fact that theentire world knew about it; American journalists themselves passed the wordfrom the battleship Texas.andP;  The finest of the United States pilots using themost advanced weapons system in the world had been routed by Qaddafi'sSoviet-trained pilots.andM;The year was 1994, so the dog-fight hasn't really happened.andP;  U.S.andP;  defenseadministrators would like to think a defeat would be made less likely by deftuse of the Department of Defense Ada programming language for embeddedsystems, such as navigation and weapons.andM;&quot;Ada gives the military a standard such that, with 15 or 20 different vendorseach supplying different components of a sophisticated weapons system, it canassemble the different modules and know they will work well together,&quot; saidDavid M. Dikel, president of Focused Ada Research in Falls Church, Va.andO;&quot;Without that ability to ensure that the different components will work welltogether, you might just see such a defeat happen.andM;&quot;Ada was really DOD's reaction to the situation where a large number ofvendors took advantage of the fact that there was no programming standard inthe weapons systems development,&quot; he explained.andM;&quot;With each vendor putting on products based on proprietary languages, DODwould have to train its people in each of scores of new languages, promotinginefficiency, waste and ultimately higher costs.andP;  Such multiple programmingtongues required a Herculean integration effort, and the final product wouldoften behave unpredictably or even fail to reach specs,&quot; Dikel said.andM;NOT TIED TO A DATABASEandM;Standardization is only one benefit of Ada.andP;  Unlike 4GLs, Ada is not tied toa database.andP;  Consequently, you don't have to buy a separate database productto use Ada.andM;In addition to saving money by not having to purchase such a database, Ada isnot tied to any specific processor.andM;The DOD is certifying Ada compilers as well.andP;  &quot;It used to be that you'd go tocompile and discover that one vendor had a different implementation of thecomplier from another vendor,&quot; Dikel said.andP;  &quot;So you'd call them on thetelephone and tell them the problem.andP;  And maybe, if you were lucky, the bugor the incompatibility would be fixed within a year or two.andP;  That wasn't theway to run a Department of Defense.&quot;andM;Although market figures based on credible research are rare, a number ofestimates have been made about the size of the growing Ada market.andP;  Oneestimate from International Resource Development Inc., New Canaan, Conn., putthe market at $700 million in 1987, with an astounding growth to $16 billionin 1990.andP;  No one really knows for sure, since DOD and most commercial Adavendors try to say as little as possible about Ada usage to avoid giving awaycompetitive secrets.andM;Othe measures of Ada usage reveal its growing importance.andP;  The Ada UsageDatabase from the Ada Clearinghouse shows a dramatic hike in the number ofongoing Ada projects within DOD from 1986 to 1989.andP;  Growth in the non-DOD Adaprojects is not so dramatic.andP;  (See chart.)andM;&quot;NOT JUST FOR MILITARY&quot;andM;&quot;Clearly, Ada is growing in importance as a language not only in the militarybut also in commercial applications,&quot; Dikel asserted.andP;  &quot;To give you an idea,my organization did a survey of the members of the ACM SIG [Association ofComputing Machinery's special interest group] devoted to Ada.andP;  Of the almost400 members, 75 (almost 19%) responded, indicating they already had generatedmore than 10 million lines of Ada code.&quot;andM;Furthermore, according to Dikel, 30% of the Ada ACM SIG are non-government.andM;&quot;Clearly, Ada is becoming the language of choice for a number of commercialapplications,&quot; Dikel asserted.andP;  &quot;It's not just for the military anymore.&quot;andM;Since Ada has been shown to be effective in expediting system development,could it be on a collision course with the new Case products?andM;&quot;No,&quot; Dikel said.andP;  &quot;I think you'll find that increasing numbers of Casevendors are developing Case products that generate Ada code.andP;  And the greaterthe support, certainly in Case, for the use of Ada, the more logical a choiceAda becomes in commercial applications.&quot;andM;ADA HAS OBSTACLESandM;But the &quot;silver bullet&quot; is elusive.andP;  Ada has some major disadvantages.andP;  &quot;Itrequires a radical change in mind-set,&quot; said Pat Crane, an analyst for ReiferConsultants, Torrance, Calif.andP;  &quot;We have found that a programmer doesn'treally become productive until after doing three projects.andP;  Like any new wayof doing things, Ada requires getting used to.andP;  But once the programmer goesup the learning curve, he or she can be much more productive.&quot;andM;The list of major software systems being built with Ada is evidence of itsmore widespread use.andP;  The list includes:andM;* the U.S.andP;  air traffic control system;andM;* NASA's space station environmental control system (via Alsys Ada compiler);andM;* Boeing's control system for its 747/767 commercial aircraft;andM;* Ford Aerospace's flight simulators;andM;* the entire U.S.andP;  Army's Finance and Accounting System that will run everyarmy installation in the U.S.;andM;* computer-aided oil extraction by BP Oil and Schlumberger Oil;andM;* pollution control and monitoring by Environplan; andandM;* financial transaction processing at Reuters news service.andM;&quot;You are just now starting to see the real impact of Ada,&quot; said Andy Szkotak,a marketing representative for Rational, Inc., a Mountain View, Calif.,andO;developer of an entire programming environment for Ada.andM;&quot;The real impact of Ada will be felt three, five, maybe 10 years from now.andO;The ball is now rolling, and, thanks to the Department of Defense, it'spicking up speed all the time,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;Even though it is in its early stages,&quot; Szkotak added, &quot;Ada is clearlybecoming more and more important.andP;  We're starting to see a number ofcommercial uses of our Ada environment.&quot;andM;Szkotak explained that Ada's innate strengths are the real reasons Ada isgaining popularity.andP;  &quot;Greater management control, a Case-like environment,reusable code and faster software maintenance make Ada the language of choicefor many applications.&quot;andM;Some trace Ada's growing popularity to its lower costs, compared to otherlanguages.andP;  Reifer for example, has compiled some interesting information onAda project costs as well as its growing use.andM;According to Crane, there are more than 20 million lines of active Ada codein 70 projects in the U.S.andM;&quot;I think a more important piece of information is the cost of developing anAda system versus other languages,&quot; Crane said.andP;  &quot;In command and controlsystems, Ada costs about $85 per line of code versus $100 per line usingother languages.andP;  In avionics, the cost difference is even greater: $150 perline for Ada code versus $200 per line with other languages.andM;&quot;With Ada you do more work up front, which promotes more thinking about whatyou're doing,&quot; Crane explained.andP;  &quot;The end result is that you reduce testingtime.andP;  The earlier you find a problem, the less costly it is to fix.&quot;andM;Developers of Ada systems, on average, spend more time in design and lesstime on coding than do developers of non-Ada systems, Crane said.andP;  (Seerelated chart.)andM;&quot;The difference is up front, and that difference is why Ada is growing sorapidly,&quot; he added.andP;  &quot;It translates into significant productivity increases,at least 25% and maybe as much as 40%.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
