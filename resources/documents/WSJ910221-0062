In Washington especiallylonger and wider views should have prevailed. It is true thatAmerican thought is at least disinterested in matters whichseem to relate to territorial acquisitions, but when wolvesare about the shepherd must guard his flock, even if he doesnot himself care for mutton.                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   So Winston Churchill, in his history of World War II,started the chapter on his strenuous but unsuccessful effortto prod Eisenhower's armies into grasping the chance to beatthe Russians to Berlin, instead of stopping nearly unopposedon the Elbe River 60 miles away. After the emergence of theIron Curtain, the Soviet enslavement of Eastern Europe andthe Berlin blockade, he wrote that this decision &quot;played adominating part in the destiny of Europe, and may well havedenied us all the lasting peace for which we had fought solong and hard.&quot;   The Elbe, of course, had been designated at Yalta as theborder between British-American and Soviet zones ofoccupation. Eisenhower saw no purpose in taking Americancasualities for territory to be handed back to Russians. Hewas also preoccupied with the necessity of hard fighting inthe Bavarian Mountains to take Hitler's National Redoubt,which turned out to be a myth. And he tended to agree withRussian assertions, in their case entirely insincere, that&quot;Berlin has lost its former strategic importance.&quot;   Churchill argued that the capital remained crucial: &quot;WhileBerlin holds out great masses of Germans will feel it theirduty to go down fighting.&quot; His political point was not thatthe West should renege on Yalta, but that it was alreadyapparent that the Russians were not living up to their partof that agreement. To provide negotiating leverage on theorganization of Eastern Europe, or failing that to liberateas much as possible, he wrote to Eisenhower in 1945, &quot;I deemit highly important that we should shake hands with theRussians as far to the east as possible.&quot;   ---   Churchill believed he lost the argument because of a&quot;deadly hiatus,&quot; with Roosevelt dying and then Trumanstruggling to consolidate his Presidency. Yet somehow theElbe decision seems characteristically American. When Americais aroused it can be remarkably efficient at war, but itoften pulls back from carrying force to its logicalconclusion.   We will not dwell on the Yalu, where we rather tend tosympathize with Truman instead of MacArthur. In Vietnam, thefirst mistake was to enmesh ourselves by sanctioning a coupagainst our ally, the second was to commit forces piecemeal.If we had mined Haiphong Harbor in 1965 as we did in 1972,Southeast Asia would not be the sinkhole it is today.   Perhaps the biggest strategic mistake in the postwar era,though, was shrinking from the British and French use ofmilitary force against Nasser. We undercut the British withfinancial power, refusing to allow them to borrow on theirswap networks to support the pound. In financial terms, thefavor was repaid in 1971, when the Bank of England's inquiryabout $2 billion in swaps to defend the dollar led to theclosing of the gold window and the collapse of the BrettonWoods monetary system.   In military terms, the episode was a turning point inBritain's decision to withdraw its forces east of Suez, inparticular from the Persian Gulf. In regional terms, it was aturning point in the development of pan-Arab militancy.Egypt, which historically had its doubts, decided it was anArab nation. And Nasser's Voice of Cairo forged theconsciousness of youths such as Moammar Gadhafi and SaddamHussein.   We rehearse this history as coalition troops prepare for aground offensive intended to wrap up the Gulf War, apparentlyready to move upon orders from President Bush. We assume,perhaps optimistically, that Mr. Bush will reject the baitbeing dangled by the Gorbachev-Saddam alliance. We assume,equally optimistically, that the hand-wringing about a groundoffensive is misplaced and that it will go quickly, though ofcourse not painlessly. What worries us is whether, even underthose circumstances, we will finish the job.   ---   The allied war plans, at least as we discern them,contemplate cutting into Iraq to surround the forces inKuwait, then holding that line hoping that the Iraqi peopleand the Iraqi military will remove Saddam Hussein. While thepolitical goal is to displace Saddam, the military mission isto liberate Kuwait. We understand the logic of this plan, andwe hope it works.   Success would of course clearly redeem the pledge thatSaddam's conquest will not stand, and of course his advancedweapons programs have already been devastated from the air.The plan would inflict a massive military defeat, theconquest and presumably surrender of a half-million man army.It would avoid the further casualties implicit in a strike toBaghdad. It would dilute the image of a neocolonialistAmerica enraging the Arab bazaars. Perhaps most comforting ofall, it would avoid a direct American responsibility forgoverning a ruined Iraq.   But would it end the war?   Only if an anti-Saddam coup eventuated. This is notinconceivable. The defeat would be devastating, and theembargo and air attacks could be continued. There are alreadyreports of an anti-Saddam riot in one Iraqi city. But then,where is the historical precedent? What dictator ever hasbeen overthrown under such circumstances? Hitler hanged thegenerals conspiring to kill him, allowing Rommel the luxuryof suicide. Noriega personally shot a would-be coup-maker. Noone we know of has called Saddam a Mussolini.   And what if no coup succeeded and Saddam hunkered down inBaghdad? Would the coalition have the political stamina tomaintain the sanctions and continue the bombing? The Sovietswould do what they could to prop him up, and he would do whathe could to become another Nasser. With a Saddam regimelingering on even in a crippled state to make propaganda andmount terrorism, there would be little prospect of the morestable Gulf envisioned in the United Nations resolutions orMr. Bush's new world order. We suspect that in history'sjudgment this outcome would not redeem the present massiveU.S. effort, let alone potential casualties from chemicalweapons in a ground campaign.   ---   The only logical conclusion of events so far is thatSaddam must go. His removal from Baghdad -- by death, flightor, preferably, capture -- is the sine qua non ofinternational peace and security in the Gulf. If this can beaccomplished by liberating Kuwait and promoting a coup, somuch the better. But there is also much to be said for doingdirectly what must be done. As the likely battle develops, wewould hope that the offensive would not stop at some Elbe inthe desert simply because that fulfills the immediatemilitary mission. The first political goal is to removeSaddam from military command and political power, and we hopeour commanders would not pass up any opportunity they have toget that job done.</TEXT></DOC>
