The tribunal said Banna would serve only half his sentence andgave him a week to appeal the sentence to a higher military court.   Banna was vice president of the governing five-man SupremeCouncil until Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan Ahmed el-Bashir ousted theelected government of Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi on June 30.   The military government has detained el-Mahdi and more than 30 ofhis advisers and says they will be tried for corruption.   After the coup, state television showed films of authoritiesseizing Banna's warehouses and finding thousands of cans of tomatopaste, articles of clothes and other items given by neighbouringcountries as emergency aid after August 1988 floods.   At least 96 people died in floods that left millions homeless andthousands without food.   Tribunal Judge Abdul-Wahab Ahmed Osman, an army colonel, said thetribunal is confiscating all Banna's property, but he did not saywhat would happen to it.   He said Banna was given 20 years in prison for subverting thenational economy, 10 years for squandering public funds and 10 yearsfor illegally making personal use of emergency aid that poured intoSudan following the floods.   Banna pleaded innocent.   At the trial's first session Aug. 12, the tribunal turned downBanna's request to be set free on bail to gather proof of hisinnocence. In protest, Banna refused to participate in any of thecourt's three hearings.</TEXT></DOC>
