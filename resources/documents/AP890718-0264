MeraBank lost $209 million in 1988 and $29 million in the firstquarter of this year, and a 13,000-member group of stockholders ofits parent company, Pinnacle West Capital Corp., urged last monththat MeraBank be spun off.   Pinnacle West also owns Phoenix-based Arizona Public Service Co.,the state's largest electric utility.   Included in the Phoenix-based thrift's cost-cutting measures isthe layoff of an unspecified number of employees over five-yearperiod, Rice's statement said. He said the layoffs reflect theeconomic condition of the marketplace.   Mesa radio station KFNN said it was told by Rice that MeraBankwas laying off 160 people, including 150 in Arizona and 10 in Texas.   MeraBank plans to sell three subsiduaries _ Sacramento,Calif.-based FIA Associates Inc., which buys and manages real estatefor pension funds; MeraTeach Inc. a data processing service companyin Dallas and Phoenix, and Meracor Insurance Corp., a Phoenixinsurance agency.   Rice also said MeraBank plans to sell off repossessed real estatein ``an orderly manner.''   While the plan is expected to reduce annual overhead to $80million from $148 million within five years, MeraBank still expectsto continue to lose money because of non-performing loans until thereal estate market recovers, Rice said.   Under the new plan, MeraBank will only make loans secured bysavings, he said.   ``New applications will not be taken for residential, commercial,construction, real estate, or consumer loans,'' Rice said.   Federal regulators are demanding that Pinnacle West pump anadditional $180 million into MeraBank to guarantee againstinsolvency, and the Arizona Corporation Commission last Wednesdaytemporarily capped what APS can pay out in dividends to PinnacleWest.   The commission acted even though Pinnacle West and APS executiveshad promised that APS would not be raided for money needed byMeraBank.   On June 29, Pinnacle West announced it and MeraBank had formedcommittees of their boards of directors to negotiate with regulatorsand to study restructuring options that include possible dispositionof MeraBank.   Pinnacle West bought MeraBank in December 1986 for $426 million.</TEXT></DOC>
