X-raytransitions between the upper 2s{sup 2}2p/sup n/3p excited levels andthe lower 2s2p/sup n//sup +2/ hole states of oxygenlike and fluorinelikelanthanum are reported. These transitions are particularly interestingas a test of the theoretical atomic physics calculations as well as apossible plasma density diagnostic.</TEXT></DOC>
