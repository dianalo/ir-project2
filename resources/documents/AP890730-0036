The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth threatened to killLt. Col. William R. Higgins ``at exactly 3 p.m. Monday,'' or 8 a.m.EDT, if Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid has not been freed by then.   Obeid is alleged to be the spiritual leader of the Shiite MoslemHezbollah militia in south Lebanon and to have played a role inHiggins' abduction.   In Washington, the White House said the kidnappers will be held``fully responsible'' for the safety of Higgins and other Americanhostages.   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler called the threat``an affront to the entire civilized community.'' She saidSecretary of State James Baker III discussed Higgins' situationearlier Sunday at a Paris meeting with U.N. Secretary-GeneralJavier Perez de Cuellar.   Israeli officials refused comment on the group's threat.   ``This will be our first response to the stupid Israeliaggression and the flagrant American support that proves U.S.complicity in the crime,'' the Organization of the Oppressed onEarth said in a statement delivered Sunday to a Western news agencyin Beirut. It called Higgins, 44, a ``proven spy.''   In a statement issued Dec. 12, 1988, the organization said ithad sentenced Higgins to death and said he ``made full confessionsabout his espionage activities.''   Higgins, of Danville, Ky., was serving as head of an observergroup attached to the U.N. peacekeeping force in south Lebanon whenhe was seized Feb. 17, 1988. His captors accused him of spying forthe CIA.   Sunday's typewritten Arabic statement was not accompanied by apicture of Higgins, the usual sign of authenticity. But it appearedtyped on the same machine and the same paper as earlier statements.   It said Obeid's abduction ``will not deter us from continuingthe struggle and resistance to snip out the cancer planted in ourblessed land and chop off the hand of the arrogants headed by thegreat Satan, America.''   In Iran, the interior minister said Islamic groups worldwidewill retaliate against Israel and the United States for theabduction of Obeid. Israeli troops were put on alert.   Israeli commandos armed with silencer-equipped pistols stoleinto the Lebanese village of Jibchit early Friday, kidnapped Obeidfrom his apartment, and flew him to Israel in a helicopter. Hiscousin Ahmed Obeid and a friend, Majid Fahs, also were seized,Lebanese police said.   Israel described Ahmed Obeid and Majid Fahs as ``assistants'' ofObeid.   Obeid has denied involvement in Higgins' abduction or inHezbollah, believed to be the umbrella for Shiite Moslem factionsholding most of the 17 foreigners held hostage in Lebanon.   According to Israeli sources who demanded anonymity, Obeid wasinvolved in the operation to kidnap Higgins and held the Marine fora time in his home. ``I believe he can tell us,'' one source saidwhen asked if Obeid was expected to provide information on Higgins.   ``It is very natural that the Islamic clergy ... and militantgroups throughout the world will take action against the interestsof Israel and the United States,'' Iranian Interior Minister AliAkbar Mohtashemi told a news conference Sunday in Tehran. ``Theywill not allow them to live comfortably.''   He named Hezbollah as one of the Moslem groups that shouldretaliate.   Asked about the fate of hostages in Lebanon, Mohtashemi said:``The issue of the hostages has no direct connection with us.''   An Iranian newspaper said Obeid's abduction jeopardized moves tofree the hostages, who include nine Americans. The hostage heldlongest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for TheAssociated Press. He was abducted March 16, 1985.   ``The Zionists have introduced a new threat to humanitarianefforts to release hostages in Lebanon,'' the Tehran Times said inan editorial Sunday.   The English-language daily said such actions ``can upset thepsychological atmosphere needed'' for ending their ordeal.   Israeli officials have accused Obeid of instigating attacks onIsrael and hinted that his kidnapping may have been arranged toprepare for a possible prisoner swap, but Hezbollah leaders haveruled out a swap.   Three Israeli servicemen are believed held by Hezbollah _soldiers Rahamim Alsheikh and Yossi Fink, captured Feb. 17, 1986,when guerrillas ambushed their patrol in south Lebanon, and airforce navigator Ron Arad, seized Oct. 16, 1986, when his planecrashed near the Lebanese city of Sidon.   The Sunday Times in London said talks to arrange the soldiers'release may now resume because Israel has a bargaining chip inObeid. It said Israel and Iran had conducted talks about tradinghostages, including a recent meeting in London last month.   Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Allon Liel said he did notknow of any talks.   Lebanon's acting prime minister, Salim Hoss, said he hasrequested U.N. and Red Cross help in efforts to secure Obeid'srelease.</TEXT></DOC>
