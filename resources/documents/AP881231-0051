President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had called for the truce in anaddress to the United Nations, but the United States rejected it.   On Friday, Alexander Bessmertnykh, a first deputy Soviet foreignminister, met U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock in Moscow to make anotherpush for U.S. support.   ``The hope was expressed that the American side will look withutmost attention at the new opportunities opening for Afghansettlement,'' the official Tass news agency said of the meeting.   Tass said Bessmertnkh also made the pitch to the ambassador fromPakistan, which with the help of the United States supplies arms torebels fighting Afghanistan's Marxist government.   Afghan President Najib on Friday offered the anti-communistguerrillas a truce beginning Jan. 1, and the Soviet Foreign Ministrysaid today in a statement carried by Tass that Moscow's troops willfollow suit.   ``The Soviet Union fully supports this peace move of the Afghanleadership and is stating, for its part, that all units of Soviettroops that still remain in Afghanistan will cease fire from thesame date,'' the Foreign Ministry said.   A rebel spokesman in Islamabad, Pakistan, dismissed the truce.   ``We did not start our fight because he asked us to,'' saidMasood Khalili. ``And we won't stop because he asked us to.''   The statement did not make clear how long Soviet troops wouldhold their fire if the rebels don't stop shooting. Najib, however,said Moslem insurgents will be given four days to accept the truce.If they refuse, government troops will start shooting again, he said.   Khalili belongs to the Jamiat-e-Islami guerrilla group whoseleader, Burhanuddin Rabbani, met in December with Soviet DeputyForeign Minister Yuli Vorontsov.   The U.S.-backed guerrillas have been fighting Kabul's troops for10 years. In December 1979, Soviet troops marched into Afghanistanto bolster their allies.   The Soviet Foreign Ministry said both sides should stop aidingtheir allies in the war.   ``Addressing specifically the United States, the Soviet sideagain reaffirms its readiness on the basis of reciprocity todiscontinue all supply of arms to the warring sides in Afghanistanfrom Jan. 1,'' the statement said.   Secretary of State George P. Shultz has rejected the proposal,noting that the Soviets rejected prior U.S. offers for mutualcessation of outside aid. He said the rebels were justified intrying to seize territory as the Soviets withdraw ``because thepeople of Afghanistan, broadly speaking, do not accept the fact thatthe puppet regime is entitled to hold certain areas of thatcountry.''   A senior Western diplomat said the Soviets poured a huge amountof military supplies into Afghanistan in preparation for the NewYear's aid cutoff and cease-fire.   The seven-party Afghan guerrilla alliance, whose headquarters arein Pakistan, rejected a cease-fire when Gorbachev offered it Dec. 7in New York.   Najib also declared a cease-fire that began Jan. 15, 1987, butthe insurgents ignored it and fighting continued.   On May 15, the Soviet Union began withdrawing its estimated100,000 soldiers from Afghanistan under a U.N.-brokered agreement.Half of the Soviet troops have left the country and the remaininghalf are to pull out by Feb. 15.   But Soviet officials say they have suspended their troopwithdrawal temporarily because of continuing U.S. and Pakistani aidto the rebels.</TEXT></DOC>
