Clark Jr.</HL><DATE>05/17/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A18</SO><LP>   The cover of Business Week earlier this month showed CraigR. McCaw, founder of McCaw Cellular Communications, thenation's largest cellular phone company. Last year, accordingto the magazine, his total compensation of $53.9 million madehim No. 1 among chief executives. That's a nice bundle,especially for the CEO of a company that has yet to earn adime.   Some McCaw investors, Business Week says, are beginning towonder whether Mr. McCaw isn't overdoing it. But MichaelJensen and Kevin Murphy argue that we should look not at thetotal amount of executive pay but at the way it is paid. Mr.Jensen, who teaches at Harvard Business School, and Mr.Murphy, who is at the William E. Simon Graduate BusinessSchool at the University of Rochester, offer their views in aHarvard working paper.</LP><TEXT>   As it happens, Mr. McCaw last year was paid $289,000 insalary and bonuses. The rest of his income came from exerciseof stock options. If he holds on to a great deal of thatstock, he is moving in a direction that Mr. Jensen and Mr.Murphy will like: His future earnings will depend heavily onjust how well McCaw does.   The two professors suggest three steps to make corporateCEOs more accountable: Boards can require that CEOs holdsubstantial amounts of company stock. Salaries, bonuses andstock options can be structured so as to provide big rewardsfor superior performance and big penalties for poorperformance. The threat of dismissal for poor performance canbe made real.   &quot;In most publicly held companies,&quot; the authors write, &quot;thecompensation of top executives is virtually independent ofperformance. On average, corporate America pays its mostimportant leaders like bureaucrats. Is it any wonder thenthat so many CEOs act like bureaucrats rather than the value-- maximizing entrepreneurs companies need to enhance theirstanding in world markets?&quot;   U.S. CEOs earn several times as much as their counterpartsin Japan and Germany. American chief executives, however,still haven't caught up with U.S. corporate leaders of ahalf-century ago.   According to the study, the average salary and bonus forCEOs of leading companies on the New York Stock Exchangeduring the period 1934 through 1938 was $882,000, in 1988dollars. This compares with $843,000 for 1982-88.   The study also showed that, with respect to pay forperformance, CEO compensation &quot;is getting worse. . . . Themost powerful link between shareholder wealth and executivewealth is direct stock ownership by the CEO. Yet CEO stockownership for large public companies, measured as apercentage of total shares outstanding, was 10 times greaterin the 1930s than in the 1980s. Even over the last 15 years,CEO holdings as a percentage of corporate value havedeclined.&quot;   All the public complaints about the levels of executivecompensation do a lot of harm, the authors contend. Corporatedirectors, leery of likely publicity, shy from writingemployment contracts that would reward CEOs handsomely forsuperior performance, even though such contracts wouldpenalize the executives for poor performance.   One reason directors may not force perform-or-be-punishedcontracts on CEOs is that chief executives often are veryclose to the directors. Boards' compensation committeesusually are composed of outside directors, but the outsidersusually have been chosen with at least the advice and counselof the CEOs.   Messrs. Jensen and Murphy would like companies not only topunish CEOs with pay cuts, if they deserve them, but to bootthem out now and then. The authors are annoyed by the factthat chief executives seem to become corporate fixtures,whether they're doing a good job or not. &quot;On average,&quot; theywrite, &quot;CEOs in our base sample (2,505 CEOs) hold their jobsfor more than 10 years before stepping down, and most give uptheir title (but not their seat on the board) only uponreaching normal retirement age.&quot; The authors cite two otherstudies, spanning 20 years and more than 500 managementchanges, that showed only 20 cases where CEOs left their jobsbecause of poor performance.   While tying the executives' compensation to the fate ofthe company stock has advantages, it also has weaknesses. Thestock market often moves in mysterious ways, not alwaysgoverned by the company's current financial results. That'swhy the Jensen-Murphy study would like to see companies makeinnovative use of cash compensation, something that few ofthem now do. In fairness, such plans should be based on thecompany's results in relation to similarly situated firms.   Someone may object that CEOs are motivated byconsiderations other than money: the beautiful offices,limousines, airplanes and other perquisites that often go tochief executives. These things go with the job and to someextent always will. But they have a major disadvantage asincentives to performance. If a CEO leads a company to a badyear, it's not likely the board will move him out of hisoffice and into a broom closet. Cash is easily paid andfairly easily taken away.   If the compensation system were reformed as Messrs. Jensenand Murphy suggest, they reckon that the average CEO wouldprobably make more money. But a number of current chiefexecutives would lose their jobs and the high pay wouldattract talented men and women to take their places.   The individual companies and the economy would be betterserved.</TEXT></DOC>
