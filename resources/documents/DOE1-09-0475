Plans for the transportationsystem will consider the following factors: the President's 1985 decisionto co-locate some defense high-level waste with commercial waste in arepository, the NWPA requirement that the private sector be used to thefullest extent possible in developing and operating the system, and thepossible approval by Congress of the DOE's proposal for a Monitored RetrievableStorage (MRS) facility, submitted in March 1987. (The MRS, if approved,would provide for the consolidation, packaging, and perhaps the temporarystorage of spent fuel from reactors.) The &quot;Transportation Business Plan&quot;,published in January 1986, reflects these considerations. The transportationsystem, when operational, will consist of two elements: (1) the casksystem, which includes the transportation casks, the vehicular conveyances,tie-downs, and associated equipment for handling the casks; and (2) thetransportation support system which is comprised of facilities, equipment,and services to support waste transportation. Development of the transportationsystem incorporates the following work elements: operational planning,support systems development, cash system development, systems analysis,and institutional activities. This paper focusses on the technical aspectsof the system.</TEXT></DOC>
