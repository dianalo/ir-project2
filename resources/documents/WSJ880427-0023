But yesterday's Sgt. Pepper generation has grown up and, after a time, so has Pier 1. Now its stores are piled to the rafters with pricey wicker settees, French stemware and decorative Italian tables that appeal to the stores' new customers -- college-educated women between the ages of 25 and 44 who earn more than $35,000 a year. With nearly 400 stores in 37 states, the Fort Worth, Texas-based chain is the only specialty home-furnishing outfit that can claim national status.    To remake its image, Pier 1 has turned itself inside out, remodeling its stores, sprucing up its advertising and bringing in tough, corporate management. &quot;They had to wrench themselves into the '80s and they spent the whole '70s doing it,&quot; says Chris LaBastille, a growth-company analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.    The company is now so Establishment, in fact, that last week the industry was thick with rumors that such All-American retailing giants as Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co., J.C. Penney Co., and K mart Corp. might seek to acquire Pier 1, which racked up about $327 million in sales last year.    Pier 1's stock soared to $11.25 a share from $8.75 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange last week after the company announced an unsolicited inquiry from an unnamed retailer seeking to buy it. Pier 1 immediately hired Drexel Burnham Lambert to help it weigh offers. Yesterday, Pier 1 closed at $10.75, up 12.5 cents, giving the company an indicated value of $326.8 million based on 30.4 million shares outstanding.    Pier 1 has approval from its major owner, Intermark Inc., to sell the company, but only if the price is &quot;substantially&quot; above its current market price, says Charles Scott, Intermark's president and chief executive. An offer of $13 &quot;wouldn't even pique our interest,&quot; he says.    Sears and the other retailers won't discuss any plans they might have to acquire Pier 1. But last year Sears created a specialty stores division and recently acquired several speciality retailers. A Sears spokesman says the company &quot;is committed to expanding&quot; into specialty retailing, and Sears has compelling reasons to do so. Like most other big retailers, it is finding it tough to increase earnings internally; profit for its merchandise group peaked in 1984 and has slipped since. Pier 1, in contrast, is expected to grow at a heady 25% a year clip for at least five years.    &quot;The big retailers don't have that kind of growth out in front of them,&quot; says Bo Cheadle, a specialty retailing analyst for Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. &quot;They're all reaching out and looking for some segment of retailing that they can grow in.&quot;    In recent months, Sears bought a small chain of women's clothing stores, a Texas-based eye-care company and is wrapping up its purchase of the Western Auto automotive parts chain. Penney also has ventured into specialty stores, buying a 20% stake in the Alcott andamp; Andrews women's apparel outlets.    There's plenty of reasons why Pier 1 is suddenly attracting attention. Since new management took over three years ago, sales have climbed 23% and profits 40%. Pier 1's gross profit margins, a measure of just how high a retailer can mark up its goods, reached an enviable 57.3% in fiscal 1988. And the company is expanding by leaps and bounds, having opened 179 new stores under its new management. Pier 1 plans another 87 new stores this year and expects to have 500 stores across the U.S. and Canada by 1990. And as an importer, it has buying and manufacturing capabilities in about 60 countries that competitors would be hard pressed to duplicate.    Pier 1 also dominates a niche it created -- exotic imported furniture and housewares that, experts predict, will continue to enjoy rapid growth as baby boomers reach their peak home-furnishing years.    Yesterday's &quot;flower children&quot; are still flocking to Pier 1 because its stores offer the unique and the exotic. The difference is that Pier 1's patrons today own their own homes and have the money to fix them up. &quot;Pier 1 appeals to the innate snobishness of the group for uniqueness,&quot; says Carl Steidtman, chief economist at Management Horizon, a retail consulting unit of Price Waterhouse.    Charles Tandy, founder of Tandy Corp., opened the first Pier 1 in 1962 as an outlet for a little-known San Francisco importer of Far Eastern pottery and housewares. Soon, the stores blossomed as the flower children of the '60s flocked to Pier 1 in search of &quot;far-out&quot; furnishings that reflected their distaste for tradition. By the end of the decade, Pier 1 was the recognized outfitter of college dorms and hippie pads -- the Ralph Lauren of the bead-and-incense set.    But as its former customers left college, cut their hair and climbed the corporate ladder, the company began to flounder. From 1971 to 1980, the number of sales dropped by half. In desperation, stores tried to win back shoppers with art supplies, wine and spirits -- even tropical fish. All of these retailing experiments failed miserably.    Pier 1's unconventional style extended even to its annual reports. Its 1984 report resembled a National Geographic magazine which informed shareholders of the company's &quot;gypsy team&quot; that scoured such exotic places as Java and Bali in search of ethnic clothing and accessories.    Pier 1 badly needed a new sense of direction -- and quickly. Clark A. Johnson, a former president of Wickes Furniture -- a company battered by the severe recession in the 1970s -- was brought in to turn Pier 1 around. Mr. Johnson instilled a market-driven, by-the-numbers approach to the business, and pushed Pier 1 to upgrade its merchandise and quadruple its size by the end of the century. &quot;We wanted to hurry up and increase our stores so that the company was positioned to take advantage of that growth,&quot; says Mr. Johnson.    That was an ambitious undertaking for a company that, like love beads and dayglow posters, had become passe. Pier 1's shoppers, if they remembered Pier 1 at all, recalled dingy stores reeking of incense and crowded with college-dorm furnishings. &quot;It was like visiting a poorly lit bazaar in some Third World country,&quot; says Stan Richards of Richards Group, Pier 1's outside advertising agency.    To shed its Third World image, floors were painted red and store layouts were redone to a less-cluttered look. Fluorescent fixtures gave way to focused spots that highlighted merchandise. And candles and incense were relegated to corners of the stores.    In changing its image, however, Pier 1 didn't completely reject its past. The large Japanese paper lanterns still hang prominently from the ceilings and rattan emperor chairs, albeit with higher price tags, are still popular. Such items &quot;really defined the company in a way that we hoped people would recognize,&quot; explains Thomas Christopher, Pier 1's senior vice president for operations.    Pier 1's &quot;new image&quot; advertising highlights merchandise with brightly colored photos of umbrellas, pillows and kitchware. Black-and-white newspaper advertisements that simply stated &quot;Sale $29.99,&quot; were replaced by eye-catching color ads in Sunday supplements that promised &quot;The best swiveling rocker since Elvis.&quot;    All the company's efforts aren't lost on former customers who are finding their way back. Joe Crews, a Dallas attorney who used to buy his window shades and bedspreads at the store while in college, now shops for end tables and lampshades while his wife buys cotton clothing.    On a recent visit, they were looking at bedspreads for a new king-size bed. &quot;When I first came back (a few years ago), I had the impression it was cheaper and poorer quality stuff,&quot; Mr. Crews recalls as he browses through some bedspreads priced at about $70 at one of Pier 1's Dallas emporiums. In the old days, the bedding selection would have been largely limited to India print spreads that sold for about $5.    Mr. Crews, like a lot of Pier 1 shoppers who used to shop there during his college days, seemed impressed. &quot;I've seen it go from a lot of little baskets and candles to better-quality furniture,&quot; he says. &quot;The styles are substantially different.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
