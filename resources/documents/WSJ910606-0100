Havertyresigned as president and chief operating officer of theholding company's flagship Atchison, Topeka andamp; Santa FeRailway unit.   Mr. Haverty, 46 years old, will be succeeded by Robert D.Krebs, Santa Fe Pacific's chairman and chief executiveofficer.</LP><TEXT>   In a news release, Mr. Haverty said the parent company'srecent spinoff of its energy and real estate operations, andthe combination of the railway and holding companyorganizations have created &quot;an increasing amount of overlap&quot;in the responsibilities of the railway head and Mr. Krebs. Hesaid he had, as a consequence, &quot;decided to seize the momentto pursue new challenges.&quot;   Since assuming the company's top railroad job in 1989, Mr.Haverty had drawn positive reviews from industry analysts.Among the accomplishments they cite are his negotiation ofagreements with rail unions, which cut the size of traincrews.   He also launched innovative intermodal services, such as ajoint venture with J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. Underthat program, Hunt trucks pick up and deliver freight forshippers, but transfer it to high-speed Santa Fe trainsbetween the Midwest and West Coast.   Mr. Haverty also helped to rebuild the railroad's imageafter its aborted merger with Southern Pacific TransportationCo.   But with the parent company's recent spin-off of much ofits non-railroad holdings, it &quot;appears that there is a lotless for Michael Haverty to do now that Robert Krebs is ableto devote more of his time to the railroad,&quot; said PaineWebberInc. analyst Anthony Hatch.   In an interview, Mr. Haverty acknowledged &quot;overlappingresponsibilities&quot; as one reason he decided to leave thecompany and &quot;look for some new opportunities&quot; in thetransportation industry, though not necessarily inrailroading.</TEXT></DOC>
