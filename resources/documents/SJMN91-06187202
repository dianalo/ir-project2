But the broaderdebate over such issues as the role government should play in alleviatingpoverty and what steps employers and educational institutions should take tomake up for past discrimination crisscrosses ideological divides.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  NOMINATION PUTS SPOTLIGHT ON BLACK CONSERVATIVELOGIC  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     The debate is deeply rooted in American history, reflecting battle linesestablished at the turn of the century by Booker T. Washington, who spoke ofthe primacy of black self-help, and W.E.B. Du Bois, who stressed collectiveaction against discrimination.;    Black conservatives win;  The immediatebeneficiaries of Thomas' nomination are black conservatives, who have movedfrom isolation to a central role -- in the media and in the Bushadministration, if not within the black community itself.;    For blacks onthe right of center, Thomas' nomination is a godsend, a chance to make clearthat there are alternative views among blacks to those of what theconservatives call &quot;the civil rights establishment.&quot;;    &quot;Clarence Thomas'being named forces people to realize that there has been a conservativetradition in the black community,&quot; said Anne Wortham, a sociologist atIllinois State University. &quot;These people reflect a lot of values and views oflife that a lot of black people grew up with -- including black liberals.&quot;;   Cracking open a lock;  Alan Keyes, president of Citizens Against GovernmentWaste and a Republican U.S. Senate candidate in Maryland in 1988, said Thomas'appointment would herald the end of &quot;intellectual totalitarianism in the blackcommunity.&quot; He added: &quot;One way or the other, this thing has broken it open.&quot;;   What is clear is that black conservatives have made important inroads overthe last decade. In some cases, their rise has been fostered by sheerintellectual power and persistence. Academics like Thomas Sowell, Glenn Louryand Walter Williams, for example, are now standard reference points in thesocial-policy discussion. Rep. Gary Franks, R-Conn., a black conservative whorepresents an overwhelmingly white district, reached power the old-fashionedway: He won an election in 1990.;    In addition, conservative think tanks andthe Republican Party apparatus have struggled to find and promote blackconservative voices. &quot;If you're black and conservative, you become famousimmediately because there are so few of them,&quot; said Amy Moritz, president ofthe National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative organization.;   Where the black conservatives part company with the traditional civil rightsleadership is not only on the benefits of affirmative action, which oftendominates the public debate, but more broadly on how much government programsreally have to offer black Americans.;    Thomas himself and other blackconservatives argue that government welfare programs often promote dependencyand encourage family breakup.;    The conservatives also contend that the oldliberal argument that poverty fosters crime may have it backward: Crime, theysay, is keeping many poor people poor. &quot;If people can't go to school, or reartheir families, or go to church without being mugged,&quot; Thomas told a 1985Heritage Foundation symposium, &quot;how much progress can you expect in acommunity?&quot;;    Across the political spectrum, black Americans welcome theidea that the rest of the country -- which was often more attentive topolitical nuance in Lebanon or Yugoslavia than among blacks -- will bechallenged to view black political and intellectual life as something otherthan a monolith.;    But many black liberals, notably supporters of thetraditional civil rights leadership, say the Thomas nomination is not aboutintellectual diversity but about power.;    &quot;I think this is one of the mostcynical nominations that's ever been made, and I think it's pure, rawpolitics,&quot; said Roger Wilkins, a law professor at George Mason University.&quot;White people have been trying to pick black spokesmen for some period oftime, and black people can tell the difference between a Clarence Thomas and aThurgood Marshall.&quot;;    Wilkins contended that Thomas and other conservativeRepublicans can hardly claim a monopoly on notions of self-help or communityuplift, which are being accorded increasing priority across the spectrum ofblack opinion.;    Among those who speak constantly of the importance offamily stability and personal discipline, Wilkins noted, is Jesse Jackson, whois no conservative. The current debate, no less than the originalWashington-Du Bois debate, is thus far more complicated, he said, than simply&quot;self-help&quot; vs. &quot;collective action.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Washington Post  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910705  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  15A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  801  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday July 5, 199100187202,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
