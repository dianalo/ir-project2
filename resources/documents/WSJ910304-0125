Bulkeley   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>03/04/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B2</SO><CO>   DGN MOT</CO><IN>COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (CPR)SEMICONDUCTORS, INTEGRATED CHIPS (SEM)</IN><LP>   Data General Corp., continuing its turnaround effort, isexpected to unveil on March 13 a very fast Unix computer thatcan serve as the heart of a network of up to 500 computerusers.   Analysts said the new product is aggressively priced, butthey warned that Data General still may have a tough timegetting substantial sales. Data General, based inWestborough, Mass., declined comment on unannounced products.</LP><TEXT>   The new addition to Data General's Aviion line can handlearound 100 million instructions a second, said one individualfamiliar with Data General's plans. It uses four of MotorolaInc.'s 88000 microprocessors linked tightly together. Thatwould make it about twice as fast as Data General's fastestcurrent computer that uses the industry standard Unixoperating system. It would also be far faster thanproprietary midrange computer systems made by Data Generaland other vendors.   While final pricing may be changed before theannouncement, one insider said the company plans a pricearound $180,000. That would be less than twice the $100,000price of its current high end Unix computers.   &quot;It's a nice product,&quot; said Robert Kidd, a technologyanalyst with Dataquest Inc. in San Jose, Calif. &quot;But theyhave to very finely tune the marketing,&quot; he added.   Jay P. Stevens, an analyst with Dean Witter, predicted thenew product will help Data General's Unix sales double thisyear to $200 million. Last year Data General had totalrevenue of $1.22 billion. But, &quot;All their competitors aremultiples of size bigger,&quot; he added.   Moreover, in the Unix world of standard computers, speedimprovements are surpassed so rapidly that technology alonedoesn't provide much of a marketing advantage. AndrewAllison, editor of RISC Management, a Los Altos, Calif.,newsletter, said that Hewlett-Packard Co. is expected tointroduce later in the month a RISC processor that is morethan twice as fast as Motorola's 88000. That would result ina one-processor computer half as fast as Data General's forabout $30,000 or one-sixth the price, he predicts.   &quot;You buy yourself a week's worth of breathing room, andthen you get blown out of the water by new announcements,&quot;said Charles Barney, director of competitive analysis atWorkGroup Technologies Inc., Hampton, N.H.   Data General has staked its future on the Aviion line.After years of success in the midrange computer business,Data General missed the desktop revolution of the 1980's andreported net losses in each of the last five years. In itsfirst quarter ended Dec. 29, however, it returned toprofitability, surprising stock analysts.   Besides providing fast computing, the new computer isdesigned to allow very fast transaction processing for peoplewith personal computers or terminals who need to getinformation from the central computer. It takes advantage ofsome of Data General's innovations added to Unix that permitefficient use of several processors at the same time.</TEXT></DOC>
