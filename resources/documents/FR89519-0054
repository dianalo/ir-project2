A group of States objected to the carriers' applicationson two grounds: (1) That the economy generally allows the members of thetrucking industry to pass through some portion of increased costs to customersvia higher prices; and (2) that the ICC fuel surcharges implemented duringthe price control period allowed the carriers to pass through increasedfuel costs. The States argued that this evidence was sufficient to rebutthe end-user presumption for the applicants, and OHA should therefore denythe applications.
