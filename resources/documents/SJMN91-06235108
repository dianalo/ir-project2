Horodysky's wifeis Ukrainian.;   &quot;The power of the center has been eroded,&quot; he said, referringto the power of the Soviet Union over its republics. &quot;The center hascontrolled the empire now for seven decades and brought it to ruin, and peopleare getting a taste of freedom.&quot;;   Like other supporters of the republics,Horodysky voiced no joy for the return of Gorbachev, who has opposed therepublics' efforts to break away from Moscow.;   &quot;My own personal hope,&quot; hesaid, &quot;is that he (Gorbachev) is not going to be in there much longer.&quot;;  Ojars Celle of San Jose, past president of the Latvian Association of NorthernCalifornia, said he is optimistic and &quot;happy that the worst is overpolitically.&quot; With the ouster of the Communist Party hard-liners who led thecoup, he said, &quot;my guess is that the Communist Party is done for, it's gone.&quot;;  And that's &quot;good news for the republics. . . . The party was really the glueof the Soviet Union,&quot; he added.;   He too, however, believes the republics mayfind it hard to jettison their Soviet ties.;   &quot;I think Gorbachev is the mainproblem, because he is against the republics gaining independence,&quot; he said.&quot;And the other problem we have is right here in Washington. President Bush isignoring the fact that the Baltic republics want freedom.&quot;;   While Bush hasmade statements encouraging the republics to gain their independence, he hasput far too little pressure on Gorbachev to make that a reality, advocates ofthe republics say.;   Soviet emigres in this country wonder how much powerRussian President Boris Yeltsin and Gorbachev each will have in the future andwhich of their views on the fate of the republics will win out. If Yeltsingains influence, they say, the republics could have independence in shortorder. But if Gorbachev emerges with his powers intact or enhanced, they fearthe republics could face a tough time.;   &quot;People want to be free, that's thebig issue,&quot; said Heino Govis of Palo Alto, who is Western regional director ofthe Estonian-American National Council Inc. &quot;If they can run their ownaffairs, without kowtowing to dictators, that's the struggle. That's what it'sall about.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  STEVE JOHNSON, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910822  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  18A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  503  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, August 22, 199100235108,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
