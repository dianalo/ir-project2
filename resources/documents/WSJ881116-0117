Output of the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose 0.4% last month, the Federal Reserve Board reported. At the same time, retail sales jumped 0.9%, the largest monthly increase since March, the Commerce Department said.    Both reports showed widespread increases, with particular strength in the auto industry. Moreover, they follow a Labor Department report that showed surprisingly strong job growth in October.    &quot;This suggests that the expansion is still well in place and that early concerns about it running out of steam appear to have been premature,&quot; said Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.    In fact, the strong growth may add to fears that the Federal Reserve will push up interest rates to prevent an acceleration of inflation. &quot;If you put the retail sales figures together with employment and the fact that the dollar has been plummeting then the Fed may feel it must drive rates up a bit,&quot; said Sandra Shaber, vice president of Futures Group Inc.    October's rise in industrial production, the eighth consecutive monthly increase, followed revised increases of 0.2% in September and 0.3% in August. The strongest gains came in auto assemblies and the production of business equipment and construction supplies, the Fed said. But it attributed much of the growth in the output of construction supplies to the settlement of strikes.    Production of home goods, such as appliances, rose sharply after dropping in September. But the Fed said output in this area has been sluggish on balance over the past year.    Mining was the only area of output that fell from September; it dropped 0.9%, the third consecutive month of decline.    Retail sales, ranging from purchases of cars and furniture to clothes and food, totaled $135.62 billion in October, up from $134.38 billion in September and $126.97 billion a year earlier. The increase followed a revised decline of 0.3% in September, previously estimated at 0.4%. The last increase bigger than last month's was the 1.6% jump in March.    While car sales climbed 1.7%, the increase in retail sales excluding the automotive industry was also strong, at 0.7%.    Durable goods and nondurable goods posted identical increases of 0.9%. Durable goods are items expected to last at least three years. Apparel and accessory stores registered sales increases of 1.2% from September. &quot;Retailers have had sluggish sales for some time now, particularly department stores and apparel stores, and this is some sign of a rebound,&quot; Ms. Shaber said.    Food stores showed a 1.1% gain in sales. Some economists suggested the rise in food and clothing sales reflected higher prices. The figures aren't adjusted for inflation, although they are adjusted for predictable seasonal variations. Sales of building materials were unchanged from September while furniture and equipment sales increased a moderate 0.2%.    The retail sales figures are based on a relatively small sample of businesses and are frequently revised as more data come in. They don't include spending on services, which accounts for a large portion of consumer outlays.    Here is a summary of the Federal Reserve Board's report on industrial production in October. The figures are seasonally adjusted.                                            % change from                                           Sept.
