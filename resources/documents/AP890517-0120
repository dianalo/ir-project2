Gorbachev has writtenPresident Bush declaring a halt in shipments of Soviet arms toNicaragua, but weapons are continuing to arrive from Cuba andEastern European countries, the State Department said today.   Spokesman Richard Boucher also said the level and pattern ofarms sales through April is very similar to that of 1988.   He said 27 shipments of military goods were sent to Nicaraguafrom the Soviet Union and its allies through April and that theestimated value through March was about $80 million.   Boucher said over the four months the arms were supplied byEastern Europe and Cuba, with the Soviets providing unspecificedother military material.   ``The general secretary indicated in his letter that the Sovietshave stopped sending weapons to Nicaragua,'' Boucher said,confirming Gorbachev had made the pledge in a letter to Bush.   The spokesman's statement echoed reports Monday night by TheWashington Post and The Associated Press that Gorbachev hadpromised to end direct weapons shipments.   The AP account, attributed to unidentified U.S. officials, saidGorbachev had not promised to end delivery of non-lethal equipment,such as vehicles, or said Cuba would no longer provide weapons tothe Sandinista government in Managua.   The White House had said on Tuesday there was no proof thatGorbachev had made good on his promise to halt weapons shipments toNicaragua.   ``At the moment it appears to be only words, not deeds,'' saidWhite House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater. ``We are very leeryof their intentions.''   Despite Soviet statements to the United States that weaponsshipments to Nicaragua's leftist government have stopped, Fitzwatersaid U.S. officials have some evidence the shipments are continuing.   ``We're reluctant to be positive about this because we didn'treceive the kinds of public commitments or the kinds of visual onesthat we would like to see,'' he said.   Despite his skepticism, Fitzwater acknowledged the United Statesdoesn't know enough about the weapons shipments to say conclusivelyif Gorbachev is keeping his promise.   Fitzwater said the material could have been in the pipeline whenGorbachev made his promise or might be coming in from anothercountry, such as Cuba.   ``I'm willing to leave the door open on the idea that maybe thatevidence (of continuing military shipments) is misleading,''Fitzwater said.   The Bush administration has been publicly and privately proddingGorbachev to discontinue aid to Nicaragua's Sandinistas, whoserebel opponents, the Contras, have been supported by the UnitedStates.   Bush has approved a diplomatic, rather than military, approachto peace in Nicaragua, and has indicated he would respond witheconomic or other incentives for the Soviets if Moscow halts aid toCentral America.   U.S. officials, who insisted on anonymity, said that not enoughwas known about the weapons shipments to condemn Gorbachev. Theysaid they were unable to determine what the shipments contained andwhether the source was the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe or Cuba.   In fact, one official said this year's shipments appear to begoing to Nicaragua at a slower rate than last year, when, duringthe first half of the year, some $130 million to $150 million worthof weapons were recorded going into Nicaragua.   Referring to Gorbachev's high profile arms-cut proposals inrecent days, and the new promise on Nicaragua, Fitzwater defendedthe Bush administration against allegations Gorbachev is taking thelead in peace initiatives.   Fitzwater said the administration's ``admittedly cautiousapproach'' is contrasted with Gorbachev's ``one of throwing out ina kind of a drugstore cowboy fashion one arms control proposalafter another.''   Gorbachev's arms proposals had not all turned out to be the boldinitiatives they at first seemed, he said.   ``We have seen a very strange pattern of public relationsgambits in the last month or two,'' said Fitzwater.   Gorbachev's promise on Nicaragua won praise on Capitol Hill.Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., chairman of the Senate ForeignRelations subcommittee on Latin American affairs, said it would be``an extremely important breakthrough'' if Gorbachev is endingmilitary aid to Nicaragua.   ``And that ought to be treated seriously and not treated as ifit were humor,'' Dodd said.   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said, ``It's high time thatthe Soviet Union does stop supplying military support to Nicaragua.If we're really to demilitarize the zone we really do need to getforeign interests out of there.''   Rep. Tom Foley, D-Wash., the House majority leader, called it``a very welcome decision.''</TEXT></DOC>
