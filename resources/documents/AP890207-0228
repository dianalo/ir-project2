He would be the latest politician to fall in a far-reachingstock-profiteering scandal.   The resignation of Saburo Tsukamoto, 61, had been expected forweeks after he confirmed in December he had profited from sellingshares in a subsidiary of Recruit Co., an information-basedconglomerate at the center of the scandal.   Three members of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's Cabinet quitbecause of the scandal, a member of the Japan Socialist Partyresigned his Parliament seat, and more than a dozen other governmentofficials, business leaders and media executives quit theirpositions because of links to Recruit.   Since the scandal erupted last summer it has raised politicalethics to the forefront of national debate. Although the sharetransactions were not illegal under securities law, they had a taintof bribery and influence-peddling. Prosecutors have questionedRecruit executives as well as government officials in a briberyprobe.   Yukio Hayashi, spokesman of the Democratic Socialists, told TheAssociated Press that Tsukamoto told party leaders Tuesday morninghe was resigning, and he would meet with the party's CentralCommittee on Tuesday afternoon to confirm his intention to quit.   Press reports said Tsukamoto told reporters at his home Tuesdaymorning he would not run for a third two-year term as chairman whenthe party holds its convention Feb. 22.   Tsukamoto was not resigning his nine-term seat in the House ofRepresentatives, where his moderate party, with 29 of 512 seats, isthe third largest opposition bloc after the Japan Socialist Partyand Komeito, or the Clean Government Party.   The Democratic Socialists had formed a tacit alliance last yearwith Takeshita's Liberal Democratic Party to give a semblance ofunity when Parliament passed the government's tax bill.   Tsukamoto's links to the Recruit scandal then were seen ashelping the governing Liberal Democrats push the tax bill throughbecause the Social Democrats were as hobbled by the taint of scandalas the governing party and could not take any high moral position.   The opposition party leader earned about $77,000 by sellingshares in the Recruit real-estate subsidiary, Recruit Cosmos, whichRecruit offered him at a bargain price before the shares were listedfor public trading in 1986.   Cabinet members who have resigned are Finance Minister KiichiMiyazawa, Justice Minister Takashi Hasegawa and Ken Harada, directorgeneral of the Economic Planning Agency.</TEXT></DOC>
