Title 43 Code of FederalRegulations (CFR) 1600 will be followed in the preparation of this plan.The public is invited to participate in this land use planning effort beginningwith the identification of issues and planning criteria.Written comments or suggested issues and planning criteria will be accepteduntil July 26, 1989. The BLM will hold a series of public scoping meetingsat which time oral comments and suggestions will be accepted. This Noticeis also to solicit coal and other resource information and indicationsof interest and needs pursuant to 43 CFR 3420.1-2, for inclusion in theKansas RMP. Coal companies, state and local governments, and the generalpublic are encouraged to submit information to the BLM to assist in thedeterminations of coal development potential and possible conflicts withother resources. Where such information is determined to indicate developmentpotential for an area, the area may be included in the land use plan forfurther consideration for leasing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments relating to the indentification of issues and planningcriteria, and to this call for coal and other resource information willbe accepted until July 26, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Comments and requests to be included on the mailing listshould be sent to: Paul Tanner, Area Manager, Bureau of Land Management,Oklahoma Resource Area, 200 NW Fifth Street, Room 548, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma73102.

The Federal mineral estate encompasses over 744,000 acres of bothsplit estate minerals (Federal minerals under private or state surface)and minerals under other Federal surface management agencies lands, (Notincluded are Federal minerals under the U.S. Forest Service managed CimarronNational Grassland).The anticipated issues to be addressed by this RMP/EIS effort include oiland gas leasing and the identification of areas acceptable for futher considerationfor coal leasing.The issue of leasing the Federal oil and gas resource will include:1. Determining which areas will be open for leasing and development subjectto standard lease terms and conditions.2. Determining which areas will be open for leasing and development subjectto minor constraints such as seasonal restrictions, (wildlife, recreation,ect. * * *).3. Determining which areas will be open for leasing and development subjectto major constraints such as no-surface occupancy (NSO) stipulations onareas larger than 40 acres in size or more than \1/4\ mile in width.4. Determining which areas will be closed to leasing. The development ofthe coal resource may be one of the issues addressed in the RMP. The BLMhopes to acquire sufficient information from this call, as well as fromits own data sources, to identify, and categorize areas of coal developmentpotential within the planning area. Industry and other interested partiesare asked to provide any information that will be useful in meeting therequirements of the Federal Coal Management Program defined in 43 CFR 3420,including application of the coal planning screens and future activityplanning such as tract delineation, ranking and selection.Information resulting from this call may be utilized in the applicationof the unsuitability criteria as well as formulation of other resourceuse screens.The type of information needed includes, but is not limited to the following:1. Location:a. Tracts desired by mining companies should include a narrative descriptionwith areas delineated on a map with a scale of not less than \1/2\ inchto the mile.b. Descriptions of both public and private industry coal users in the generalregion.2. Quantity needs (tonnage, dates) for both public and private industrycoal users and coal developers.3. Quality needs (by type and grade) for end users of the coal.4. Coal reserve drilling data which may pertain to the planning area.5. Information relating to surface and mineral ownership:a. Surface owner consents previously granted, whether consent is transferrable,surface owner leases with coal companies.b. Non-Federal, or fee coal ownership adjacent to Federal tracts currentlyleased or mined.6. Other resource values occurring within the planning area which may conflictwith coal development:a. Identify the resource value, location by narrative description and map(\1/2\ inch to the mile) delineation.b. State the reasons the particular resource would conflict with coal development.Any individual, business entity, or public body may participate in thisprocess by providing coal or other resource information under this call.The proposed planning criteria include:1. All proposed actions must comply with laws, executive orders, and regulations.2. For each proposed action, the resource outputs must be reasonable andachievable with available technology.3. All proposed actions must recommend resource allocations which are inaccordance with the principles of multiple-use and sustained yield.4. All proposed actions must evaluate and consider long term benefits tothe public in relation to short term benefits.5. All proposed actions must provide for the orderly development of leasableminerals while containing environmental impacts to a minimum. These planningissues and criteria are presented for public comment and are subject tochange based upon such public comment. Comments should be received by July26, 1989. The planning team will seek public involvement throughout theplanning process. Public scoping meetings to gather comments on the preliminaryissues and criteria are scheduled for:<ITAG tagnum="15">July 18, 1989, 3-5 p.m., Diplomat Room, Embassy Suites Hotel, 10601Metcalf Road, Overland Park, Kansas </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">July 19, 1989, 3-5 p.m., Ramada Inn, 1949 North 9th Street, Salina,Kansas </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">July 20, 1989, 3-5 p.m., Seville Inn, 1400 West U.S. Highway 54, Pratt,Kansas </ITAG>Complete records of all phases of the planning process will be availablefor public review at the Oklahoma Resource Area Office, 200 NW 5th Street,Room 548, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73102.
