Jesse Jackson's stunning victory in the Michigan caucuses.    Mr. Jackson's landslide win on Saturday -- he beat Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis with 55% of the vote to 28% -- ended Mr. Dukakis's hopes of assuming the mantle of the party's inevitable nominee. Mr. Dukakis still has more delegates than anyone else in the field, with 604 to Mr. Jackson's 598, according to an Associated Press count. But with two dismal showings in Illinois and Michigan over the past two weeks, he is in a weakened position.    For the first time, many Democrats now are realizing that Mr. Jackson could come to the Atlanta convention in July with more delegates than anyone else. This poses a dilemma to the party: either to give him the nomination or put him on the ticket, which many Democrats think would spell certain defeat in the general election -- or to risk splitting the party by denying the nomination to the man with the most votes.    The inability of any candidate to emerge as the dominant front-runner already is causing some Democrats to look for an alternative. &quot;A lot more Democrats are thinking more seriously about Mario Cuomo now,&quot; Sen. Alan Cranston (D., Calif.) said Saturday night after learning of the Michigan results.    But the notion of turning to someone who hasn't even entered the primaries or caucuses strikes other Democrats as folly. Ironically, New York Gov. Cuomo came very close to endorsing Mr. Dukakis over the weekend before the Michigan results were known, but negotiations between the two camps stalled.    Rep. Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.), who made the Michigan contest a test of his campaign's survival, finished a distant third with 13% of the vote. He is expected to drop out of the race and file today for re-election to his congressional seat. Late last week, Mr. Gephardt privately was planning to endorse Mr. Dukakis if he had to drop out. But the smashing Jackson victory doomed that possibility for now.    While final tallies were still being made yesterday, Mr. Jackson appeared to have won 61 of Michigan's 138 delegates, while 43 went to Mr. Dukakis, 22 to Mr. Gephardt and 12 remained undecided. Mr. Jackson has captured more popular votes than any other Democrat in the 31 state primaries and caucuses so far. He has won in eight states, from Alaska in the west to Alabama in the deep South to the industrial Midwest with Saturday's victory. He also won the popular vote in the Puerto Rico caucuses.    His Michigan landslide was an embarrassment to Detroit's black mayor, Coleman Young, who endorsed the Massachusetts governor rather than Mr. Jackson. &quot;Gov. Dukakis got the endorsement of the mayor of Detroit. I got the votes of the people of Detroit,&quot; Mr. Jackson said. &quot;I don't think I did very well in Michigan,&quot; Mr. Dukakis conceded as he congratulated Mr. Jackson. Mr. Jackson also rode over the leadership of the United Auto Workers, which had split its support between Mr. Dukakis and Mr. Gephardt.    Mr. Jackson's victory was fueled by a huge turnout of blacks, who voted for him overwhelmingly; Michigan has 18 congressional districts, but over a quarter of the total vote came from two predominantly black districts in Detroit. Indications are that Mr. Jackson still garnered only a small minority of the white vote.    This is why many Democrats are so nervous about Mr. Jackson and worried that his showing could complicate their efforts to recapture the White House in November. Before Mr. Jackson's Michigan victory, much of the party leadership was hoping that Mr. Dukakis would emerge there as the inevitable nominee.    Mr. Dukakis has picked up some impressive endorsements in recent weeks but he hasn't made much progress among voters since the Super Tuesday contest March 8. He has failed to draw significant blue-collar support or to express a clear message. New questions have emerged about his strategy of spending only a few days campaigning in Michigan. Although Mr. Dukakis prevailed in the North Dakota caucuses Saturday and is favored to win the Connecticut primary tomorrow, he faces tough tests in Wisconsin and the big states of New York and Pennsylvania next month.    Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore and Illinois Sen. Paul Simon went nowhere in Michigan, each getting only 2% of the popular vote and no delegates.    ---                        Delegate Count                   Needed to nominate: 2,082               Dukakis                   604               Jackson                   598               Gore                      363               Gephardt                  167               Simon                     172               Uncommitted               363               Source: Associated Press    ---                 How the Democrats Have Fared -    In Democratic contests held so far, here's how the candidates stack up:    -- Gov.
