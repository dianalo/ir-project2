<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-54-0600 </DOCNO><TEXT>On July 23, 1983, the Interplanetary Magnetic Field turned strongly northward,becoming about 22 nT for several hours. Using a combined data set ofionospheric convection measurements made by the Sondre Stromfjord incoherentscatter radar and convection inferred from Greenland magnetometer measurements,we observe the onset of the reconfiguration of the high-latitude ionosphericcurrents to occur about 3 min following the northward IMF encounteringthe magnetopause. The large-scale reconfiguration of currents, however,appears to evolve over a period of about 22 min. Using a computer modelin which the distribution of field-aligned current in the polar cleftis directly determined by the strength and orientation of the interplanetaryelectric field, we are able to simulate the time-varying pattern of ionosphericconvection, including the onset of high-latitude ''reversed convection''cells observed to form during the interval of strong northward IMF. Theseobservations and the simulation results indicate that the dayside polarcap electric field observed during strong northward IMF is produced bya direct electrical current coupling with the solar wind. copyright AmericanGeophysical Union 1988</TEXT></DOC>
