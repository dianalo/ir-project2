Connally raised $2,678,000 at his bankruptcy auction that ended yesterday evening.    The auction, which stretched over four sessions, was attended by sellout crowds, particularly at the opening session Friday night. Mr. Connally and his wife, Nellie, sat in the front row of each session. At several points over the weekend, Mr. Connally jumped up to encourage higher bids for some of the furniture, artwork and memorabilia from his political career.    The highest price paid at the auction was $120,000 for a painting by Oscar E. Berninghaus, a New Mexican artist. The painting, &quot;Indian Chief and Pony,&quot; was bought by a Phoenix resort. Other big ticket items in the widely publicized sale were a saddle with the Texas state seal ($10,500), Mr. Connally's desk and office furniture ($25,000) and a fake Modigliani portrait by Elmyr De Hory ($22,500). Mr. Connally's badge from a Fort Worth Fat Stock Show sold for about $800.    Mr. Connally, as previously reported, declared personal bankruptcy last summer after his energy and real estate ventures turned sour. He owes nearly $50 million and estimates his assets at $13 million.    The proceeds from the auction were about in line with the auctioneers' expectations. </TEXT></DOC>
