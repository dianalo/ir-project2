ALPAL is geared foruse by expert computational physicists as a significant aid in buildingcomplex simulation programs. Notably, ALPAL generates almost all of theFortran code needed to carry out the simulation indicated by the physicsmodel that is given as input. However, ALPAL is a research code, andas such, many more capabilities are being added to it, including extendingits ability to generate code for other parts of a physics simulationprogram. In order to make the importance of this new language very clear,this report includes a survey of some of the languages and tools thathave been developed to aid the computational physicist in simulationwork. When the capabilities of these languages are examined, it becomesclear that the powerful new language ALPAL has broken significant newground. 32 refs., 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
