Most of the tampering is blamed on supporters of the governingInstitutional Revolutionary Party, which has won every presidentialelection since the party was founded in 1929.   For today's general election, however, thousands of oppositionsupporters planned to oversee polling places in the most ambitiouseffort yet to prevent fraud, the dominant issue of the campaign.   The opposition credits the governing party's string of victoriesat least in part to fraud. The Institutional Revolutionary Partyinsists it has won honestly because of its overwhelming popularityand masterful organization.   President Miguel de la Madrid, in a nationally broadcast messageMonday, pledged to guarantee fair elections. He said ``it is acommitment of the government of the republic to comply strictlywith the law.''   Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the governing party candidate, isfavored to defeat the two other major candidates, Manuel J.Clouthier of the National Action Party and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas ofthe National Democratic Front.   In hopes of neutralizing vote fraud this year, a citizenwatchdog group with opposition backing has issued a handbook forpoll workers.   In it, the Democratic Assembly for Effective Suffrage outlineswhat it says are 20 ways to cheat.   It explains things like ``strolling ballot boxes,'' or pollingplaces which move from their assigned sites, confounding oppositionsupporters looking for a place to vote.   It warns of ``galloping armies of voters'' who dash from onepolling place to the next, using phony registration cards orsigning in with ink that later fades, erasing signs of multiplevoting.   Beware, the manual warns, of ``vote tacos'' _ ballots crammedwith extra ballots.   During the counting process, it says, expert forgers go to workon phony tally sheets in secret ``falsification bunkers.''   The bunkers, the manual says, work in tandem with clandestine``alchemy workshops'' where experts at computer terminals linked tothe Interior Ministry, the National Voter Registry andInstitutional Revolutionary Party offices monitor the tallies fromeach polling place.   Political parties are allowed to have workers on duty at thepolls and the manual tries to give them what it calls ``antidotes''to fraud.   These generally boil down to vigilance and to alerting thepublic if something seems amiss.   But the watchdog group admits helplessness in its ability tomonitor the government's computerized electoral roll and the votercredentials it issues.   ``Neither the citizens nor the (opposition) parties possess thetechnological capability to outdo the National Voter Registry inits ability to perform an endless series of tricks and produceunlimited versions of the electoral roll.''</TEXT></DOC>
