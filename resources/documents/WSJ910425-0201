Weighed down by debt, overcapacity and slumping sales, theAkron, Ohio, tire maker had an operating loss of $30.4million, or 52 cents a share. In addition, it took apreviously announced charge of $59.7 million, or $1.02 ashare, for work force cuts and restructuring. The per-shareloss for the quarter was $1.54.</LP><TEXT>   In 1990's first quarter, Goodyear earned $20.9 million, or36 cents a share, including a one-time gain of $4.4 million,or seven cents a share, from a tax-loss carry-forward. Salesslipped 7% in this year's first quarter to $2.5 billion from$2.69 billion.   The results, while dismal, were no worse than analysts hadexpected, considering the auto industry's downturn and theprice wars ravaging the tire industry. And Goodyear ChairmanTom H. Barrett said earlier this month that the secondquarter would be profitable.   Goodyear's results weren't as poor as those of somerivals. Last week, for instance, France's Groupe Michelin,the world's No. 1 tire maker, reported a 1990 loss of $972million.   &quot;Considering the world-wide economic conditions, thenumbers weren't that bad,&quot; said analyst Harry Millis, whoheads Cleveland-based Fundamental Research. Mr. Millis saidGoodyear's core units, tires and general products, actuallymade $20 million before taxes and special items. In compositeNew York Stock Exchange trading, Goodyear shares rose earlyand closed at $21.50 a share, up 50 cents a share.   While Goodyear's tire business offered some encouragement,its All-American pipeline continued to gush red ink, with apretax loss of $25.1 million. The $1.6 billion pipeline hasbeen a consistent money-loser since its construction in 1985.With no buyers in sight, Goodyear expects it will lose moneyfor at least two more years.   Goodyear's formidable long-term debt, which climbedslightly to $3.31 billion as of March 31 from $3.29 billionon Dec. 31, continued to restrain the company's prospects, aspretax interest expenses rose 3.5% to $81.7 million in thequarter from $78.9 million a year ago.   The $59.7 million one-time charge, announced last month,was to eliminate 1,100 white-collar positions and todiscontinue Goodyear's startup facility in South Korea.</TEXT></DOC>
