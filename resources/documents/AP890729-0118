(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Secretary of the Navy on Saturdaydenied that Greenpeace protesters forced the Navy to scrap aTrident 2 missile launch off Cape Canaveral.   Instead, foreign flag ships prompted officials to call offFriday's scheduled test, said Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett.   The Navy canceled the Trident 2 test several hours after fourGreenpeace U.S.A. vessels penetrated the safety zone and chased asubmarine involved in the test in the Atlantic about 50 miles offthe cape.   A statement issued by the Navy said the launch was postponed``because of intentional interference from foreign flag ships in adesignated hazardous operational area.'' Some Greenpeace vesselsfly foreign flags.   ``We did not disrupt the proposed shot yesterday because of theGreenpeace activity,'' Garrett said. ``There were foreign flagvessels in the area. It's a normal precaution that we take, and ifwe have to delay, it's still not going to disrupt the schedule.''   Greenpeace spokeswoman Shannon Fagan said two large Greenpeaceships and two motorized rafts carrying anti-nuclear activistsshadowed the launch submarine Tennessee for hours in internationalwaters.   Safety regulations require that a countdown be stopped ifnon-essential boats come within about three miles of the submarine.One raft was photographed beside the submarine.   The planned launch was to be the second underwater test firingof the Trident 2, the Navy's newest, most powerful weapon.   The first test March 21 ended in an explosion when the $23.7million missile pinwheeled out of control four seconds after it waslaunched from the Tennessee. Nineteen land launches, 15 of themsuccessful, preceded the sea trials.</TEXT></DOC>
