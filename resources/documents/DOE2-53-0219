The Tevatron is basedupon a superconduction magnet ring 1 km in radius. It operates in twomodes, both providing the highest energy particles in the world. In thefixed target mode, 800 GeV protons are extracted and distributed as primary,secondary or tertiary particles to fifteen experiments. In the collidermode, protons are brought in headon-collisions with antiprotons at alocal energy of 1.8 TeV. The detectors and scientific goals are alsobriefly described.</TEXT></DOC>
