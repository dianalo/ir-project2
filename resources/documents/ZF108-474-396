(column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Somerson, Paul.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>More Power to YouandM;On a recent flight west, I sat in front of two yoyos in nearly identicalyellow power ties, guys who looked as if they burned rain forests and putGordon Gekko quotes on their office walls and spoke about Van Gogh paintingsnot in terms of color or form or texture but of how much they were likely tofetch in Tokyo.andM;Somewhere over Nebraska, the two started going at it heatedly over &quot;time andspace.&quot;andP;  A bit surprised, I tuned into the conversation, wondering if theywere referring to some Einsteinian thought experiment.andP;  Turned out they weredebating the profits in television versus print ad sales.andP;  Further into theflight, my journalist ears perked up when they began talking magazines andclips.andP;  A few sentences further into the conversation, I realized they werediscussing guns.andM;Things aren't always what they seem.andM;Here's another example: We get a good deal of feedback about each issue.andO;Last week I received a phone call from someone who wanted to talk about themagazine.andP;  Well, not exactly &quot;talk.&quot;andP;  Fulminate is more like it.andP;  The stafferwho forwarded the call to me explained that it was about our technicalsection.andM;MacUser readers are an extremely knowledgeable group; they can hold their ownin any technical discussion and are the most savvy power users in theindustry.andM;Not this caller.andP;  He reminded me of someone who sits behind you in a funnymovie and laughs in all the wrong places.andP;  Or the type who signs up for amagazine with no intention of reading it, just so he can write a nasty letterto the editor and cancel his subscription.andM;&quot;I was looking at a friend's copy,&quot; the caller began, &quot;and I couldn't believeit.andP;  You filled the whole back of the issue with a story on .andP;  .  . andO;programming!&quot;andP;  He chewed dyspeptically on every syllable like a televangelistpronouncing the word subpoena.andM;I started to answer, but he plunged on.andP;  &quot;Nobody cares about programming!andO;What you should be running is lots of articles for beginners.andP;  Programmingstories belong in...DOS magazines.&quot;andP;  The word DOS was delivered with thespecial contempt most people reserve for child-beaters or congressmen.andM;I wanted to find out more about this caller.andP;  &quot;Are you a reader?andP;  And whatkind of Mac do you use?&quot;andM;&quot;No, I don't read your magazine.andP;  And, no, I don't have a Mac yet, but I'mright on the verge of getting one.andP;  Just as soon as they come down in price.&quot;andO;And -- click -- he was gone.andM;MacUser never was a &quot;beginners' magazine&quot; and never will be.andP;  While it's truethat nobody can be an absolute expert in every area, all industries have acore group of users who know the system inside out.andP;  This top layer ofexpertise drives the industry.andP;  Power users such as these are the ones whoknow which products to buy and why, how to set up and troubleshooteverything, and how to wring the maximum horsepower out of every system.andM;At the other end of the scale, casual and beginning users who want a littlehand-holding are drawn to publications that are easy -- warm, fuzzy, andsoft.andM;But serious business users who need to know which products to buy and howbest to use them require something with a lot more punch.andM;Fine.andP;  But why do we run pieces on programming?andM;To understand the answer, you have to understand the question.andP;  And thequestion is a bit like asking, &quot;Why do you run pieces on spreadsheets?andO;Aren't those just for bean counters?&quot;andP;  Long ago (circa 1980), spreadsheetprograms were strictly an arcane tool for accountants.andP;  Now they're amainstay of every businessperson's repertoire.andP;  And the reason that happenedis that several bright people (such as Bob Frankston, Dan Bricklin, and MitchKapor) realized that, with a personal computer, the spreadsheet metaphorcould easily be programmed to reflect a single user's what-if questions.andM;Here's another question: &quot;Why do you run pieces on word processing?andP;  Aren'tthose just for writers?&quot;andP;  It's a question that might have made sense in 1980.andO;But in 1990, the question isn't just rhetorical; it's ludicrous -- writing isa part of practically everyone's job, and the many word processors availablefor the Mac make that job immeasurably easier.andP;  And one big reason why isbecause they can be programmed.andP;  When you check off your preferences inMicrosoft Word and define a few new styles, you're programming your very owncustomized word processor.andP;  With a few clicks of the mouse, you're performinga programming job that used to be mammoth enough to keep a bevy ofprogrammers busy for weeks on end.andM;The same thing for database programs, page-layout programs, utilities, and soon.andP;  In other words, the reason we write about programming is becausevirtually everyone who uses a Mac is a programmer -- although only a fewwould cite it on their 1040 under Occupation.andM;Here's a partial list of things that you already know (or ought to know) howto program on the Macintosh:andM;* The Control Panel: Armed with a few cdevs, the Control Panel is like a miniobject-oriented-programming environment.andP;  Check a few boxes, and you'vecustomized your system.andM;* ResEdit: Thanks to the modular nature of the Mac's system software, you canuse this little gem to switch a host of features on and off that control theall-important look and feel of your Mac.andM;* PostScript: Every time you send a PostScript document to the printer,you're actually downloading a little program.andP;  If you learn a bit of thelanguage (as we'll be showing you in an upcoming issue), you can speak to theprinter directly.andM;* Telecommunications: Any Hayes-compatible modem uses a programming languageto control the flow of data.andP;  Most people rely on default settings in theirtelecom software, but a little exploration can pay off with improvedthroughput, and that translates into faster transmission and lower phonebills.andM;* MacroMaker: As most of you know, macros are basically miniprogramsconsisting of sequences of keystrokes and mouse clicks to be recorded,stored, and played back on demand.andP;  Lots of application software -- such asspreadsheet programs and telecom software -- has macro capabilities (oftencalled something like a Watch Me feature), and there are several stand-alonemacro-creating packages.andP;  MacroMaker is free, as part of the system software.andM;* HyperCard: Most power users have experimented with Apple's entry-levelgeneral-purpose programming tool.andM;* System 7: The Mac is the handsdown best user platform on the market; goodsolid custom programming can make it even better.andP;  Apple clearly believes inthe power of programming and is building tools and hooks into future Systemreleases to facilitate this.andP;  Apple-Events -- part of the forthcoming System7 -- will open things up dramatically and become the first truly enablingtechnology for user scripting.andM;It's already starting to happen.andP;  Any company that seriously wants to kickperformance into high gear will need Mac programmers to hot-rod things andfill in the gaps -- if it doesn't already have a programmer or two on-staff.andM;This doesn't mean that everyone will suddenly have to learn the intricaciesof Pascal or C.andP;  Program generators, advanced versions of scripting languagesbuilt in to future applications, and AI-based programming tools will all helppour on the power.andM;So, if you're still asking why we run programming pieces, it's becauseprogramming is the power in power user.andP;  It's the power in our own PowerTools section.andP;  And putting power into the hands of individual users is whatit's all about.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
