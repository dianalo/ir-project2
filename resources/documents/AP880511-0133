Tabatha Foster, 3{, of Madisonville, Ky., was in very criticalcondition late this morning at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh,said the spokeswoman, Sue Cardillo.   ``It's very bad,'' Ms. Cardillo said. ``She's beginning to showsigns of multiple organ failure, and her heart ... is beingsupported by medication.''   Tabatha's condition fell Monday from serious to critical aftersurgeons changed drainage tubes inserted last month to relieve abuildup of bile in her transplanted liver, Ms. Cardillo said.   Tabatha was connected to a breathing machine and was unconsciousand under sedation, Ms. Cardillo said.   The medication that subdues the body's tendency to rejecttransplanted organs left Tabatha susceptible to infection, Ms.Cardillo said. Doctors did not know what caused Tabatha'sinfection, which has entered her bloodstream, to flare.   Tabatha received a new liver, small intestines, pancreas andparts of a stomach and colon during experimental surgery that endedNov. 1.   Similar procedures had been performed only twice before in theworld. Both patients died.</TEXT></DOC>
