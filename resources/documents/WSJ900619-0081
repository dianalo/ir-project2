The court determined, 6-2, that a federal law creating anexception to patent-infringement claims to allow informationto be gathered about drugs also applies to medical devices.</LP><TEXT>   The decision was a victory for Medtronic Inc. ofMinneapolis, which was sued for infringement by Eli Lilly andamp;Co. of Indianapolis. More broadly, it is a substantial defeatfor older, established medical-technology developers withlong-held patents, allowing more leeway and flexibility tonewer, upstart companies.   Older concerns, such as Procter andamp; Gamble Co. andBristol-Myers Squibb Co. warned in friend-of-the-court briefsthat such a decision would &quot;curtail innovation&quot; bymanufacturers of medical devices. But the attorneys generalof 19 states and the American Association of Retired Personsfiled briefs saying such a ruling would enhance competitionin design and marketing of medical technology.   The decision, written by Justice Antonin Scalia, requiredthe court to interpret a 1984 technical amendment to thefederal law that regulates food, pharmaceuticals andcosmetics. The amendment said it isn't patent infringement touse or sell a &quot;patented invention&quot; of another company if thepurpose is &quot;reasonably related&quot; to obtaining data to submitto the FDA.   The FDA must approve all new drugs and medical devices.The amendment was intended to allow competitors to enter thecommercial market as soon as a patent expires, rather thanwaiting until then to start the test marketing.   Lilly sued Medtronic for infringement of its patent for apacemaker that regulates tachyarrhythmia, or a too-fastheartbeat. Medtronic cited the 1984 amendment, asserting thatit is manufacturing its own implantable heartbeat regulatorfor clinical testing to provide data to the FDA.   Lilly argued, and a federal district court in Philadelphiaagreed, that the amendment applied only to drugs and wasn't adefense to patent-infringement claims on medical devices. In1988, a federal jury awarded $26.6 million to Lilly forpatent infringement.   But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit,which handles all patent appeals, ruled in March 1989 thatCongress didn't intend to limit the provision to drugs. Theappeals court sent the case back to the district court todecide whether Medtronic's use of the devices was solely forthe purpose of gathering FDA clinical data. But Eli Lillyappealed to the high court, putting the issue of Medtronic'spurpose on hold.   Yesterday, the high court sent the case back to the courtto decide the validity of Medtronic's claim that it wasmarketing the implantable heart regulator to gatherinformation for its FDA application.   Justices Anthony Kennedy and Byron White dissented, sayingCongress intended to limit the 1984 amendment to drugs.Justice Sandra O'Connor didn't participate in the case. (EliLilly andamp; Co. vs. Medtronic Inc.)                                                                                                          Suing Thrift Regulators                                                                                                          The justices agreed to decide whether federal law allowslawsuits for damages for the actions of federal bankregulators that allegedly cause losses to former thriftdirectors. The high court agreed to hear an appeal by theJustice Department in a dispute with Thomas Gaubert, a formerDemocratic fund-raiser and onetime chairman of IndependentAmerican Savings Association of Irving, Texas.   A federal appeals court in New Orleans ruled in October1989 that Mr. Gaubert may sue the Federal Home Loan Bank ofDallas and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which Congresshas since replaced with the Office of Thrift Supervision.   Mr. Gaubert charged that he lost $25 million in property,which bank regulators required him to contribute to bolsterthe thrift's assets. The contribution was part of anagreement in which Mr. Gaubert gave up control of the Texasthrift in exchange for regulators' dropping an inquiry intohis role in an Iowa thrift.   While under the control of federal regulators, the Texasthrift's value dropped from $75 million to a negative balanceof $400 million, wiping out the value of Mr. Gaubert'sproperty.   Mr. Gaubert, along with four other former officers ofIndependent American, was sued last month by the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp. for approving investments that theFDIC said caused about $50 million in losses at the Texasthrift. Last year, Mr. Gaubert was acquitted of bank fraudcharges brought by the Justice Department in connection withthe Iowa thrift.   The case before the Supreme Court involves the FederalTort Claims Act, which allows lawsuits for damages againstthe government. The Justice Department argues that thelawsuit is barred by a legal exception to the act unlessgovernment employees were performing &quot;discretionary&quot;functions. But the appeals court ruled that the actions offederal regulators with regard to Independent American were&quot;operational&quot; in nature and weren't covered by the exceptionfor discretionary functions. (U.S. vs. Gaubert).                                                                                                          Apple Computer Case                                                                                                          The justices refused to hear an appeal by disgruntledshareholders of Apple Computer Inc. who filed asecurities-fraud lawsuit after Apple's stock dropped 75% in1983. The lawsuit contended that the company and itsdirectors made misleading statements about the salesprospects for the Lisa computer and companion Twiggy diskdrive. In 1987, a federal judge dismissed the class actionwithout a trial, finding no evidence of a securities-lawviolation.   In September 1989, a federal appeals court in SanFrancisco affirmed the dismissal of most of the lawsuit. Theappeals court ruled that Apple's directors didn'tintentionally mislead investors about Lisa's outlook, becausethe directors reasonably thought the prospects for successwere good. Moreover, the appeals court said that Apple'soptimistic statements about Lisa were offset by gloomyforecasts and criticisms that reached the market through thenews media.   The appeals court ordered a trial on one issue of whetherApple officials made misleading statements because they knewof technical problems with the disk drive that would affectproduction of the computer. That part of the case may nowproceed. (Schneider vs. Apple Computer Inc.)</TEXT></DOC>
