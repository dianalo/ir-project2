Zia, an army general who died Aug. 17 in a plane crash, had madethe ``Islamization'' of Pakistani society a pillar of his policy.   But he faced opposition from some politicians, members of themiddle class and others. With his death, the fate of a furtherexpansion of Islamic law in Pakistan is in doubt.   Islamic law is interpreted with different stringency from oneIslamic nation to another. Zia's Islamic laws included a ban on theconsumption of alcohol, the provision of flogging and stoning aspunishment for such crimes as drinking and adultery, and a 2.5percent tax on the rich to help the poor.   Zia failed, however, to codify into Pakistani law Islam'sopposition to collecting interest payments on loans. Punishment byflogging was rare, despite its presence in the legal code, andthere were no stonings.   Zia was the most enthusiastic of all of Pakistan's recent rulersin applying Islamic law, said Professor Mahmood Ahmad Ghazi, aleading scholar at the International Islamic University inIslamabad and the man who led prayers at Zia's funeral.   If ``someone not as enthusiastic as Zia'' takes over, Ghazisaid, the pace of Islamization will be slow in this 98 percentMoslem nation.   Ghulam Ishaq Khan, the new president of Pakistan, and hiscaretaker Cabinet met a week after Zia's death and pledged tocontinue Islamization. But nationwide elections are scheduled forNov. 16, and that could strongly affect government policy.   Opposition leader Benazir Bhutto, who could become primeminister if her party wins the elections, has spoken out stronglyagainst Zia's brand of Islamization, saying no one should imposepersonal religious views on the country.   ``There are some parties that are enthusiastic, and there aresome parties that are lukewarm,'' Ghazi said.   In May, Zia dissolved parliament, citing corruption, laxity andlawmakers' failure to promote Islamic law over a three-year periodas justification for his move.   He then issued a presidential order in June that decreed thelegal code of Islam to be the supreme law of Pakistan and expandedcourt powers to review laws for conformity with the Koran, theMoslem holy book.   Ms. Bhutto was quoted at time as saying that ``Islam, like inthe past, is again being used to perpetuate oppressive rule.''   Zia said the decree would not affect the rights of non-Moslems,or the country's business contracts with other nations.   The order expires later this year unless reaffirmed by thegovernment.   Defining the relationship between Islam and the country's legalsystem has been a central question since 1947, when Pakistan wascreated as a home for Moslems on the Indian subcontinent.   Many Islamic principles were enshrined in law before Zia came topower. But he sought to expand these dramatically, giving courtsconstitutional power to determine whether laws conformed to theKoran and the traditions of the Prophet Mohammed.   Laws dealing with the constitution itself, judicial procedureand fiscal and personal matters were excluded from the review atfirst, but some of these exemptions were removed by Zia's Junedecree.   Although special courts now review laws for compliance withIslamic tradition, final appeals still go to civil high courtsrather than to the legal bodies of religious scholars that exist insome other Moslem states.   Many groups _ including much of the middle class and manylawyers and educated women _ have opposed Islamization, believingthe country should not turn its back on educational and legaltraditions from the West that have been in place since the Britishcolonial era.   Zia's policy also was coolly received by Moslems with differentinterpretations of Islamic law. For example, the jurisprudence ofthe Shiite sect, which constitutes about 5 percent of the country's107 million people, differs significantly from that of the majoritySunnis.</TEXT></DOC>
