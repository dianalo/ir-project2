As a result, the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries will continue to pump near capacity through 1992'sfirst quarter while remaining divided over the need for newproduction quotas -- or how to apply them -- when oil demanddrops seasonally in the second quarter.</LP><TEXT>   Still, the brief two-day conference, which ended lateWednesday, was relatively free of the acrimony that markedOPEC's September meeting in Geneva, when Hisham Nazer ofSaudi Arabia clashed with some of the other oil ministers.   Also, despite their differences, most of the ministersleft Vienna yesterday convinced that petroleum prices shouldremain firm until the second quarter even though OPEC'soutput is approaching 24 million barrels a day and will risefurther as Kuwait and Iraq, sidelined by the Persian Gulfcrisis, export more oil.   For the first quarter, said Jibril Aminu, Nigeria's oilminister and the new president of OPEC, &quot;prices in generalwill be similar to what we've noticed in the fourth quarter.&quot;   Many oil industry analysts agreed that a lack ofproduction controls going into the new year had been expectedand isn't likely to have much immediate effect on petroleumprices. &quot;I don't think it's too bearish,&quot; said Mehdi Varzi,London-based research director of Kleinwort Benson Securitieswho was here to observe the results of the meeting. Hesuggests prices should rise $2 to $3 a barrel during the nexttwo months.   Also, while they didn't renew their quota system now fornext year, the ministers reaffirmed their commitment to theirJuly 1990 agreement. That agreement -- scrapped after thePersian Gulf crisis that began a few days later --established a new formula for individual production quotasfor OPEC's 13 member nations and also set a minimum referenceprice of $21 a barrel for OPEC's oil. Based on a basket ofseven crudes, OPEC's average price briefly touched $21 inlate October but has since dropped back below $20.   Citing the inclusion of that commitment in the officialOPEC statement issued after this week's conference, NordineAit Laoussine, Algeria's oil minister, told reportersyesterday: &quot;The quota system is not dead.&quot;   Mr. Ait Laoussine was one of the leaders of the movementhere to adopt a new quota formula now so that it would beready when needed. &quot;We have tried to caution our colleaguesthings may sour in the first quarter,&quot; Algeria's ministersaid. &quot;The only way we can deal with the second-quarterproblem,&quot; he added, &quot;is to apportion production among themember countries.&quot;   Opposing any move at this time toward production cuts nextyear were Saudi Arabia's Mr. Nazer, outgoing OPEC PresidentCelestino Armas of Venezuela and some others. They arguedthat an oil shortage would be more likely than an oil glut solong as there is little spare producing capacity and theSoviet Union's oil exports continue to decline.   Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, however, have been able toincrease production sharply to offset last year's loss offour million barrels a day from Iraq and Kuwait. The majorityof OPEC members haven't been able to increase production bymuch and need firm prices to maintain their revenues. Algeriaand Indonesia are among them. They would like those countriesthat accounted for the bulk of increased output since July1990 to cut back the most in 1992's second quarter.   But Ginandjar Kartasasmita, Indonesia's oil minister, saidin an interview that he would be willing to share inproduction cuts in the second quarter so long as the totalOPEC reductions are &quot;fair and done on the basis of the Julyagreement, at least the spirit of the July agreement.&quot; Still,he said, OPEC faces &quot;a very difficult meeting&quot; Feb. 12 whenthe ministers are scheduled to consider the contentious issueof quotas.</TEXT></DOC>
