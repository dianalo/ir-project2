The temperature effect on the distribution coefficient of U(NO/sub3/)/sub 4/ between 30% TBP-kerosene and 1-4 N HNO/sub 3/ is studied inthis work and the thermodynamic functions of the extraction equilibriumare reported when the acidity of the aqueous phase is 1.12 m and 2.20m respectively.</TEXT></DOC>
