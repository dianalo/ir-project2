The proposed change at Canada's biggest stock market comesas battle lines are being drawn around the world betweenproponents of electronic trading and those who backtraditional floor trading, such as exists at the New YorkStock Exchange.</LP><TEXT>   The board of the Toronto exchange has scheduled a vote ofits members for Feb. 13 on whether to fully automate all itstrading operations by next Jan. 1, with the consequentclosing of the trading floor.   The proposal has been long expected and hasn't met muchopposition, except from Toronto's 105 specialists, or marketmakers, and about 135 other traders who currently use thefloor. Provincial regulators would have to approve thechange.   Toronto is Canada's largest stock exchange with tradinglast year valued at 67.76 billion Canadian dollars (US$59.31billion). All of its trades are executed through its computersystem, from terminals in offices or on the floor.   Some people in Toronto said that eliminating floor tradingwill concentrate trading activity in big stocks andstrengthen the position of large brokerage firms with pocketsdeep enough to take sizable positions in these stocks. Italso could cost a lot of floor traders their jobs.   The proposed change in Toronto combines a computer-tradingsystem and the continued use of specialists. This can be seenas a compromise between the sort of system on the Big Board,where specialists on the floor make markets in specificstocks, and the U.S. National Association of SecuritiesDealers Automated Quotation system (the over-the-countermarket), where prices are negotiated between traders oncomputer screens.   Specialists who make markets in Toronto-listed stocks willcontinue to do so. The 105 specialists who now work on thefloor &quot;will move {to their firms' offices} and trade just asthey do today,&quot; said Pearce Bunting, the Toronto exchange'spresident. About 45 specialists already operate from theiroffices.   Toronto's specialists, called &quot;registered traders&quot; aregenerally similar to the Big Board's, standing ready to makea market in specific stocks. Toronto specialists areaffiliated with member firms. The 135 other traders who usethe floor make trades for firms but aren't obligated to makemarkets in specific stocks.   About half of Toronto's listings, accounting for about 25%of volume, already are traded exclusively through itsautomated system. Specialists in those listings work fromtheir offices, get their information from terminals and dealwith customers by telephone.   Specialists for the other listings currently work on thefloor, take orders from floor traders and give them toterminal operators. They say the face-to-face contact givesthem a better feel of the market.   Randall Reynolds, a registered trader at Wood Gundy Inc.,has been trading stocks electronically since he transferredfrom the floor almost a decade ago. Overall, he says, &quot;Idon't see much change.&quot;   But Mr. Reynolds said it will be difficult at first forfloor traders to make the switch because &quot;on the floor theywork with their eyes and their ears. They'll lose theirears.&quot;   Mr. Bunting, the exchange president, said the main reasonfor ending floor trading was &quot;dramatically reduced costs&quot; forthe exchange and its members. He declined to estimate suchsavings, but an exchange spokesman said eliminating the floorwould cut the exchange's office-space needs by about 40%, or30,000 square feet.   &quot;It's an economic win for the brokers,&quot; said MurrayGregga, a senior vice president and director of institutionaltrading at ScotiaMcLeod Inc. He estimated that as many as 25%of traders might be laid off.   Mr. Gregga said he expects the change will result in moretraders focusing their attention on stocks with large marketvalues that have mainly been followed by small groups offloor traders. He said that would benefit the biggestsecurities dealers with capital to take large positions insuch shares. &quot;There will be more traders vying to make theirday-to-day living off these stocks, {so} the little tertiarystocks are just going to go out the window,&quot; he said.   Added Austin Taylor, chairman of ScotiaMcLeod, &quot;Some ofthe smaller {brokerage} houses with limited capital may bedisadvantaged.&quot; This probably would result in consolidationin the industry, he said.   Mr. Bunting said the exchange could have become fullyautomated as early as 1977, when it developed a tradingsystem that exchanges in Paris, Belgium and Spain laterpurchased and used to replace their trading floors.   If Toronto goes ahead with the switch as expected, it willbe the largest North American exchange to do so. In Canada,the small Vancouver stock exchange abolished its tradingfloor in 1990. The Montreal Exchange said it intends to keepits trading floor open, although, as in Toronto, all of itstrades currently are reported and executed through itscentral computer. Volume on the Montreal Exchange is aboutone-fifth that of Toronto.   In New York, a Big Board spokeswoman declined to commentdirectly on the Toronto plan. In a statement, the exchangesaid: &quot;We feel a true auction market, where orders meetdirectly, where price improvement is possible, and where allinvestors have the same opportunities is the best possiblekind of market. That's the kind of market we have and intendto maintain.&quot;   Nasdaq argues that the computer network is necessary toexecute international transactions efficiently.   &quot;Computers let you spread a stock market whereverregulations permit,&quot; said Lynton Jones, managing director ofNasdaq International in London. He added that the ascentralized floors disappear, stocks will move closer tobeing traded in an &quot;18-hour market, melding together theEuropean and North American time zones.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
