(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A fugitive eluded police for 12 years byborrowing a dead man's name from a newspaper's obituary columns andassuming his identity, authorities said.   Kyle Eugene Hendricks, 38, was arrested Monday night on chargesof drug trafficking and violation of probation in Virginia.   He was posing as Dale Vernon Brundell, a man who died more thana decade ago in the Alexandria, Va., area, said special agent JeffFortier of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.   ``He was shocked that we located him,'' said Fortier.   Hendricks had a driver's license, Social Security card,insurance papers and credit cards bearing Brundell's name, Fortiersaid, adding, ``He's assumed that name lock, stock and barrel.''   Also going by the name of Brundell were Hendricks' wife, Vikki,and their 8-year-old son.   ``His son learned for the first time tonight that his namewasn't Brundell,'' Fortier said.   Hendricks was arrested in Alexandria for theft and resistingarrest 10 years ago. He was booked under his assumed name, and noconnection was made to the earlier charges at the time.   But Virginia authorities eventually connected the two names, andan FBI fingerprint check confirmed last month that fingerprintstaken 10 years ago matched those of Hendricks.   Virginia authorities notified their Florida counterparts whenthey learned that a Florida driver's license had been issued to``Brundell.''   Hendricks' wife was aware of the dual names but was notimmediately charged, the agent said. Fortier said he didn't knowhow long they had been married.   Neighbors said the unemployed man was quiet and had little to dowith anyone else.</TEXT></DOC>
