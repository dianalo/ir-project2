This paper presentsa three-area production simulation model which evaluates: The expectedunit energy generation. The expected area unserved energy. The expectedpool-wide production cost savings and the expected area production costsavings. Random unit forced outages, unit joint ownership, and transmissioninterconnection constraints are considered in this proposed model. Inthis paper, the simulation results of a sample three-area system arealso presented.</TEXT></DOC>
