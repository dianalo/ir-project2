The two proposed laws and a draft constitutional amendmentlegitimizing the private sector were submitted to the 2,970delegates of the National People's Congress, China's legislature.   The delegates are expected to discuss the measures in smallgroups over the next week and approve them April 13, the last dayof the congress' 20-day session.   Rather than break new ground, the proposed laws would formalizechanges already under way in the economy and clear up confusionover the new practices. The proposed measure on joint ventureswould provide a legal framework for foreigners doing business inChina.   Lu Dong, head of the State Economic Commission, said theproposed law on state-owned enterprises was essential to China'smodernization.   ``Whether or not (state-owned) enterprises can have greatvitality will have a great influence on the overall development ofour national economy,'' he told the delegates, gathered in the hugeGreat Hall of the People.   ``Therefore ... we must separate government and industry andguarantee the autonomy of enterprise management,'' Lu said.   The government hopes autonomy will turn China's oftendebt-ridden, inefficient state stores and factories into lean,competitive production machines. They will be free to respond tochanges in market demand and also will be free to go bankrupt ifthey make bad decisions.   It is no coincidence that the government plans to implement abankruptcy law later this year.   More than 70 percent of China's 90,000 state-run enterprisesalready have signed contracts with the government giving theirmanagers some degree of adminstrative autonomy. The new law isintended to erase lingering ambiguities over the roles of managers,local Communist Party officials, local government and unions.   Similarly, the proposed law on Chinese-foreign joint venturesand the constitutional amendment allowing private enterprise serveto codify changes that have already been introduced.   Although the draft state enterprise law probably is the mostwidely discussed in Chinese history, having been submitted tospecial seminars nationwide, Thursday was the first time its actualwording was released to the general public.   ``An enterpise shall, in accordance with law, make its ownmanagerial decisions (and) take full responsibility for its ownprofits and losses,'' reads one of the 68 articles.   Enterprises also will be allowed to sell their products on theirown after meeting state quotas, chose their own suppliers, settheir prices and enter into contracts with foreign parties.   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping first suggested such a law in 1978,when he began his campaign to reduce central planning andrevitalize the economy through monetary incentives. Versions havebeen discussed by four previous legislative sessions, generatingdebate unprecedented in China's largely rubber-stamp congress.   Official media reports indicate the congress' standing LawCommittee made revisions almost up to the last minute. One majorcriticism was that workers could be victimized by autocraticmanagers.   Late additions included several clauses that promise wide powersto workers, thus substantially eroding business managers' promisednew autonomy.   ``An enterprise shall ensure that its staff and workers enjoythe status of masters. ... (and) shall practice democraticmanagement,'' the bill reads.   It adds that workers' congresses must approve wage adjustmentsand bonus distribution plans, and have the right to supervise andcall for the removal of top company officials.   The draft law on joint ventures would help standardize the formof contractural joint ventures and promote their growth, ZhengTuobin, foreign trade minister, told the congress.   The bill states that the joint venture ``should not beinterfered with'' in making managerial decisions, and allows eitherthe Chinese or foreign partner to chair the board.   Chinese companies already have formed more than 5,000 jointventures with foreign companies, with a total foreign investment ofabout $3.38 billion.   However, many foreign businesses have complained about the lackof a legal framework for their joint venture agreements.   The proposed constitutional amendment declares the privatesector to be ``a complement to the socialist public economy'' thatis allowed to exist within legal limits. China currently has morethan 18 million private-sector enterprises, most employing only oneor two people.   A companion amendment declares that rights to use land may betransferred. All land in China is considered owned by the wholepeople, but in the past year several cities have sold land-userights for up to 50 years.</TEXT></DOC>
