Concernover ozoane and other oxidants prompted the Environmental ProtectionService (EPS) of environment Canada to sponsor a number of special oxidantassessment studies to characterize ozone episodes, their potential impactin Canada and the contributi8on of long range transport to measured concentrations.Activities were also initiated related to the design and implementationof an ozone control strategy including emission inventory development,monitoring and monitoring method development, effects studies, controlstrategy development and cost/benefit analyses. Given that ozone impactswere occurring in Canada it was considered prudent to take immediateaction to reduce precursor emissions. This action was in the form of(i) adopting more stringent light dut vehicle emission standards; (ii)proposing adoption of emission regulations for heavy duty vehicles; and(iii) a public education campaign to reduce misfuelling and reduce tamperingwith emission control devices. These actions should also have the addedbenefit of improving urban air quality in respect to the air pollutantscarbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and lead and of reducing the depositionof acidic nitrogen species.</TEXT></DOC>
