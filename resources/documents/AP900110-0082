The court ruled in an Illinois case that statements a criminaldefendant makes after an unlawful arrest may not be used byprosecutors to contradict a defense witness' trial testimony.   The so-called exclusionary rule, created by the court 75 yearsago, generally prohibits the use at trial of any illegally obtainedevidence. But the court later carved out an exception by allowingprosecutors to use such evidence to contradict a defendant's owntrial testimony.   Today, the justices refused to expand that exception to letprosecutors use such evidence to rebut or discredit otherwitnesses' testimony.   The Illinois Supreme Court was wrong to allow such an expansion,Justice William J. Brennan wrote.   ``Finding this extension inconsistent with the balance of valuesunderlying our previous applications of the exclusionary rule, wereverse,'' Brennan said.   He was joined by three liberal allies, Justices ThurgoodMarshall, John Paul Stevens and Harry A. Blackmun, and by JusticeByron R. White, usually one of the court's most conservativemembers on ``law-and-order'' issues.   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M.Kennedy, Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia dissented.   Writing for the dissenters, Kennedy said, ``Where the jury ismisled by false testimony, otherwise subject to flat contradictionby evidence illegally seized, the protection of the exclusionaryrule is perverted into a license to use perjury ... free from therisk of confrontation with prior inconsistent utterances.''   The Illinois court had voted to allow the introduction ofillegally obtained evidence in the trial of Darryl James, sentencedto 30 years in prison for a 1982 murder.   James was 15 when arrested in his mother's beauty parlor for apair of Aug. 30, 1982 shootings. He was tried as an adult.   Prosecutors said James shot and killed Geliria Boyd and woundedanother youth in a late-night confrontation on a south Chicagostreet.   Five prosecution witnesses identified James as the triggerman,and testified that on the night of the crime he had long,reddish-brown hair.   At his trial, James had short, black hair.   James did not testify but two defense witnesses testified in hisbehalf. One said that James had short, black hair the night of theshootings.   Prosecutors then won the judge's permission to let a policedetective testify that James, when arrested, said he had long,reddish-brown hair the night of the crime and that he had his hairdyed and cut at his mother's shop.   The judge initially had disallowed such testimony, ruling thatJames' arrest was unlawful because police at the time did not havea court warrant or probable cause to suspect him of committing acrime.   Today's decision means James is entitled to a new trial, atwhich the statement obtained during his unlawful arrest will not beallowed as evidence.   But the five eyewitness identifications could be used at the newtrial.   In a separate criminal law decision involving evidence, thecourt ruled by a 6-3 vote that federal juries may be told about adefendant's alleged prior criminal conduct even if a previous trialon those charges ended in an acquittal.   White wrote the court's majority opinion in that case, andBrennan, Marshall and Stevens dissented.   The ruling upheld the bank robbery conviction and 70-year prisonsentence of Reuben Dowling, convicted of robbing $7,000 from theFirst Pennsylvania Bank in Frederiksted, St. Croix, in the VirginIslands on July 8, 1985.   Federal appeals courts had been divided over whether suchevidence could be used.   The cases are James vs. Illinois, 88-6075, and Dowling vs. U.S.,88-6025.</TEXT></DOC>
