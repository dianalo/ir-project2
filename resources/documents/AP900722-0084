Visibility at the Riley Creek Visitors Center at Denali NationalPark, 120 miles south of Fairbanks and Alaska's top touristattraction, dropped to a quarter-mile at times over the weekend.   ``The park is up and running as usual but they're cautioningpeople not to exert themselves and to spend time indoors,'' saidPark Service spokesman John Quinley.   People in Fairbanks were given similar warnings.   No injuries or serious damage has been reported.   Smoke from wildfires that have already burned more than amillion acres made it impossible to get accurate estimates of thesizes of some blazes, Quinley said.   Thick smoke grounded some aircraft used in fighting the54,000-acre Tok River fire, said Trish Hogervorst-Rukke, aspokeswoman with Alaska's inter-agency fire information center.   But the smoke also held down temperatures in the interior andpushed up the humidity, reducing the intensity of the blazes.   The Tok River fire, started by lightning three weeks ago,remained the state's most labor-intensive blaze, occupying 789firefighters.   Officials estimate that firefighting statewide is costing$700,000 a day.   The Beaver fire, named for a village on the Yukon River,remained Alaska's largest; on Sunday it was burning a 10-by-48-milesection of spruce forest, said Hogervorst-Rukke.   Fires along the Alaska Highway reduced visibility to less than 2miles in a wide region north of Tok to Fairbanks.   Authorities said Alaska firefighting crews were also sent to theCanadian border village of Old Crow, where about 280 people wereevacuated because of fire near the Porcupine River.   A fire 25 miles northeast of King Salmon was estimated at 1,100acres and was being fought with specially designed planes fromCanada that fly low, scooping water from lakes and depositing itover fires.   The Kanuti Flats fire, about 140 miles north of Fairbanks, wasburning 100,000 acres on Sunday and was within two miles of thetrans-Alaska oil pipeline. Authorities were monitoring the fire butnot fighting it.   Authorities said there was no danger to the pipeline, whichQuinley said isburied beneath the tundra near where the fire isburning.</TEXT></DOC>
