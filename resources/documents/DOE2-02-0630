There are two areas of freezing. The firstis the formation of ice from free water within the gas stream. The secondis hydrate formation. This paper will deal with ice formation. To minimizeproblems, the author discusses several options: 1. Keep the fluid temperatureabove the freezing point by applying heat. 2. Feed an antifreeze solutioninto the gas stream. 3. Select equipment that is designed to be ice freein the regions where there are moving parts. 4. Design systems that minimizefreezing effects. 5. Remove the water from the gas stream.</TEXT></DOC>
