Now comes an opportunity to satisfy food-hungry Russians,issue-hungry politicians and power-hungry Europeans whilesimultaneously satisfying the interests of both Americanmilitarists and pacifists. The answer is a massivedistribution of Western food aid by NATO military forces.   The germ of this idea originates with Rep. Les Aspin ofWisconsin and Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, two Democrats who,groping for a foreign-policy initiative, last weekendproposed that the U.S. military deliver $1 billion inAmerican emergency food aid to the Soviets. Their proposalderives from President Bush's success in deploying the U.S.military to distribute emergency aid to Kurds in theaftermath of the war against Iraq (a war that Sen. Nunnhappened to oppose).   The Democrats are on to a good idea this time. Thecitizens of what once was the Soviet Union almost surely willneed food aid, and it's in no one's foreign policy orhumanitarian interest to have them go hungry. Yet thecrumbling empire is in such chaos that it lacks the abilityto reliably distribute food to its citizens. Perhaps the onlysemi-efficient Soviet institution left is the Red Army. Butno one's interest is served by enhancing its stature.   The U.S. military clearly has the capability to take onthe food distribution role by itself, as Messrs. Nunn andAspin suggest. But why not satisfy several moreconstituencies and foreign policy goals?   Like the U.S., almost every European country is talkingabout the need for massive food aid yet similarly failing toact. According to Italian Foreign Minister Gianni DeMichelis, that's largely because no one knows how to ensuredelivery of the food.   Furthermore, Europeans are busily looking for commonundertakings -- at least of the sort that don't require anyreal risks. And it's certainly in America's interest tomaintain NATO as the centerpiece of a broader political andmilitary partnership with Western Europe.   So why not let American and European men and women inuniform distribute Western food aid together?   Not only would this give NATO a meaningful new role, butit also would underscore that the West means it when it saysit's prepared to live in friendship and to assist citizens ofthe former Soviet Union in making the transition to moredemocratic and prosperous lives. Indeed, while one objectionis likely to be that the Soviets won't accept NATO troopsbearing grain, that sounds strangely like old thinking.Beyond enhancing NATO's stature, the idea has ancillarybenefits. For one thing, it would calm the widely divergentfears of both American hawks and doves.   The doves, of course, fear that despite all the changesgoing on in the world these days the U.S. military budgetwill continue to fund arms and armies. Here at least would beone opportunity to substitute plowshares for swords.Meantime, American hawks fear that global changes willdissipate the need for a strong U.S. military role. But herewould be their opportunity to finally have the U.S. militaryinvade the Soviet Union, albeit with parcels of food.   Another argument in favor of a NATO food crusade is thatFrance would oppose it. France, of course, is the one majorEuropean nation that has long refused to participate inNATO's military activities. Of late the French are going evenfurther, leading a determined effort to dismember NATO inhopes of diminishing U.S. influence in Europe -- andincreasing their own. By and large, with a few exceptionslike the Gulf War, it's a truism of foreign policy that whatFrance favors isn't favorable to America. Or, put anotherway, what would distress France is probably good for almosteveryone else.   For example, among the many beneficiaries of a NATO foodcrusade would be the Germans. Western Europe's most powerfulcountry is also its most timid. Germans are constantlyreminding each other and the wider world of the historicaland constitutional constraints on the use of their militaryforces. The last thing Germany wants is to be perceived asEurope's giant, but a role as hefty NATO Santa Claus wouldsuit Germany's self-image just fine. As for sundry, lesserEuropeans from the Dutch to the Danes, they could happilyplay Santa's elves.   Arguably, Europe is less stable these days than at anytime since the close of World War II. The end of Sovietdomination of Eastern Europe, the continuing disintegrationof the Soviet Union itself, rising ethnic tensions, disputedborders and impending waves of immigrants all threatenEurope's stability, if not security. Yet Western Europe'sresponse -- led by the French and abetted by the Germans --is to seek to emasculate the one institution, NATO, that hasprovided common stability and security, just as necessary nowas when Soviet tanks threatened from across the Fulda Gap.   Instead, the Euro-doves seek to substitute a maze of newinstitutions and entities (West European Union, Conference onSecurity and Cooperation in Europe, the European Community,the Council on Europe, etc.) with overlapping memberships,imprecise functions, nebulous goals and nonexistent militarypower. It's the absence of military power and willingness touse it that has made Europe's peace-making efforts inYugoslavia so futile.   Better when NATO ministers meet this week in Rome thatthey focus on something substantive, positive and practical.Better they join American military forces in feeding hungryRussians.   ---   Ms. House is vice president, international of Dow Jones.</TEXT></DOC>
