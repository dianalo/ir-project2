<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-66-0819 </DOCNO><TEXT>This is a simplified general review of new energy technology now underdevelopment in and outside Japan. For the new power generation technology,a mention is made on fuel cells. In Japan, a 1,000kW class phosphoricacid type is now in operation with the objective of putting it to practicaluse in between 1990 and 1995. In USA, IFC Co. designed a 11MW plant.Concerning energy storage, in Japan, 4 kinds of new batteries have beendeveloped and tested for new battery electric power storage systems andmuch larger types are under study. Concerning systems using lead batteries,Japan, USA and West Germany are putting them to the practical use. Withrespect to superconducting energy storage, Japan and USA are competingequally in its research and development. West Germany advances in compressed-airenergy storage, followed by USA, USSR and Italy, but Japan has none inthis field. In the field of natural energy, the article states aboutvery active developments of solar energy in Japan, USA and Europe, anddevelopments of geothermal energy in Japan, USA and Italy, etc.. Regardingoceanic and wind power energy, developments in Japan, USA and Europeare mentioned and concerning cogeneration, technological developmentsin Japan, USA and Europe are introduced.
