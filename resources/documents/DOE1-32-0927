This is stronglyinfluenced by the way in which the soil is removed prior to coal extraction,its subsequent handling and replacement. Use of heavy earth-moving equipmentfor soil reinstatement leads to the deterioration of soil structure,characterised by horizontal layering, the absence of structural fissureswithin the soil profile, and increased bulk density of the subsoil leadingto reduced air filled pore space. The problems that arise from thesesoil conditions on cereal growth derive from excess water in the topsoil resulting in delayed establishment, modification of root and shootgrowth and lower grain yields. An investigation of the effects of installingpermanent underdrains prior to revegetation on soil conditions and cropgrowth, has been initiated on the progressively restored Butterwell opencastsite and an adjacent unmined control site in Northumberland. The installeddrainage system provides preferential surface soil conditions for thegrowth of winter wheat in early spring. This allowed earlier root penetrationand more efficient nutrient uptake which resulted in enhanced tilleringand dry matter production. Site differences established during this periodpersisted to give significant yield differences at final harvest. Wheatyields were consistently higher on the unworked control site comparedto the two restored sites. Early drainage of the Butterwell site gavesubstantial yield improvements with the exception of the very dry seasonof 1983-1984. Differences in spring barley yields were less pronouncedover the three sites, although yield levels in general were low. Soilconditions in early spring on the undrained Butterwell site delayed seedbed preparations and often resulted in cloddy tilths and low plant establishment.10 refs., 1 fig., 6 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
