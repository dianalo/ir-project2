 This also allows the storage and access of large amounts ofinformation on-line.andM;Because SCSI is an industry- and ANSI-standard systems-level interface, withits own command language, it requires less knowledge about the devices withwhich it interacts.andP;  Not only can it work with most hard disks, but it alsocan work with an array of radically different products, such as printers,scanners, tape drives and bar-code readers.andM;SCSI drives have some advantages over their Enhanced Small-Device Interface(ESDI) drive counterparts.andP;  While ESDI drives are slightly less expensivethan SCSI drives, typically they allow only the connection of two devices.andO;ESDI drives are also device-specific and work only with hard disks.andM;SCSI drives have individual controller logic, allowing for the queuing ofmultiple-disk operations.andP;  SCSI system controllers keep track of operationsin progress on several devices, acting as a data translator.andP;  Thisintelligence allows the drive to store and manipulate data, freeing the CPUto undertake other tasks.andM;Other SCSI advantages are quick transfer rates -- up to 5M bytes per secondin burst mode -- and the capability of overlapped I/O.andP;  In I/O-intensiveenvironments, overlapping allows the device to disconnect from the SCSI busto handle input/output.andP;  When the device is finished with the input/outputtasks, it reconnects to complete the transfer.andM;However, SCSI has some disadvantages.andP;  Command overhead is high due to thecomputer having to build and process SCSI command blocks -- thus slowingthroughput.andP;  Another disadvantage is cost.andP;  The SCSI drive's circuitry iscomplex and expensive, requiring a larger initial investment.andM;All major disk-drive manufacturers now offer their fastest disks with SCSIconnections, and most PC manufacturers offer both SCSI controllers and drivesas options with their high-end systems.andM;SCSI drive buyers must consider reliability, compatibility and supportednetwork operating systems.andP;  Other issues are installation and whether thedrive is sold with the required controller that interprets the SCSI commandset.andM;According to Russ Golish, president of Hi-Tech Computer Solutions, a SCSIdrive wholesaler in San Diego, larger-capacity SCSI drives tend to be abetter buy, which means buyers should consider purchasing the largest drivethey can afford.andM;&quot;Right now we're seeing great pricing on 700M-byte and 1.2G-byte SCSI driveswith five-year warranties,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;To get double the capacity for anextra few hundred dollars is very attractive&quot;andM;For customers implementing SCSI across a network, Golish tries to find outall he can about their environment.andM;&quot;It's important to tell your dealer everything about what the network setupand applications are, what type of backup operation is installed, what thesecurity issues are, and what the current and projected storage requirementsare,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Once all those factors are known, then we can best figureout how to distribute storage space in a logical manner.&quot;andM;John Simonds, product marketing manager at Core International Inc., a SCSIdrive manufacturer in Boca Raton, Fla., said, &quot;Implementation of a commonhost adapter that all products can talk to is crucial.andP;  It's important thatall components are compatible in order to cause less conflict on thechannel.&quot;andM;Buyers of SCSI drives should consider whether the drive is upward-compatiblewith SCSI-2, according to Gene Milligan, director of product strategy atSeagate Technology Inc., a SCSI drive manufacturer in Scotts Valley, Calif.andO;SCSI-2 provides higher performance, especially in Extended Industry StandardArchitecture applications, and has the potential to double throughput.andM;&quot;The major benefit in purchasing a SCSI drive is that you avoidobsolescence,&quot; he added.andM;Doug Fields, product marketing manager at Maxtor Corp., a SCSI drivemanufacturer in San Jose, Calif., said that in addition to the need forSCSI-1 and SCSI-2 compatibility, disk-drive and controller compatibility iscritical.andP;  &quot;It's important that the drive has been tested and works with awide range of controller cards.andP;  You want to ensure that the product willplug and play in your environment,&quot; he said.andM;According to Simonds, when looking at drives with capacities of more than500M bytes, the biggest factor to consider is network fault tolerance.andM;&quot;That's where buying multiple drives comes into play,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Purchasingtwo or more drives is a real advantage for data insurance.andP;  Multiple drivescan mirror and duplex information for better reliability.andM;&quot;500M bytes is a lot of information.andP;  There's a great liability if thatinformation is lost,&quot; he added.andP;  &quot;You have the cost of replacing the drivers--but more importantly, the larger issue of the business opportunities lostduring the downtime.&quot;andM;When planning to purchase a single SCSI drive, potential data loss is evenmore important, Simonds added.andP;  &quot;That's when a buyer really needs toconcentrate on the reliability factor, making sure the company offers adecent warranty,&quot; he said.andM;The emergence of drive arrays within the SCSI marketplace promises to boostnetwork reliability.andP;  Drive arrays (usually four or five drives) incorporatea special controller that directs writes across multiple disk drives so thatcopies of a single file are located on several hard disks.andP;  This provides forbuilt-in fault tolerance.andP;  When using drive arrays, a parity drive isdesignated when one drive fails; the contents are rebuilt on the parity.andM;&quot;[With arrays] not only do you reap the benefit of recovering any lost data,you don't lose any extra disk capacity as you do with duplexing,&quot; Simondssaid.andM;&quot;Where an array will typically consist of four drives and a parity drive,duplexing is two drives and two controllers that are both separate systemswriting the same information back and forth -- wasting a drive,&quot; he said.andO;&quot;The disk array allows for information to be transferred faster, sincewriting on four drivers can transfer [data] simultaneously.&quot;andM;For now, vendors say that buyers can expect to see a price erosion within themarketplace because of increased competition.andM;&quot;You can now purchase the same capacity drive of two years ago for half theprice,&quot;
