During his recent trip to Romania, Secretary of State James A.Baker III offered Romania $80 million in U.S. aid, including500,000 tons of feed grain and 7,500 tons of butter.   ``Eighty million is an important amount but let me say that it'sso samll for our desperate situation,'' Minister of State DumitruMazilu told reporters. ``We need much more.''   ``You understand, dear colleagues and friends, how difficult itis for a mother to try to find food for children in the stores andto get nothing,'' he added.   Mazilu, who said he was discussing the aid request with membersof Congress, called the food situation in Romania worse than beforethe overthrow of Communist President Nicolae Ceausescu in December.   Mazilu said that immediately after Ceausescu's overthrow thefood situation improved temporarily when the new authoritiesblocked exports, but food supplies diminished after a few weeks,despite help from abroad.   He said his country needed ``At least $500 million from theUnited States, but at the same time we need help from othercountries. I have to underline that in Europe, France has told usit is ready to help.''   Mazilu asked for restoration by the United States of ``mostfavored nation'' status for Romania, an arrangement that wouldlower U.S. customs duties on his country's goods. Baker had saidpreviously that the matter was being re-examined for Romania andother Eastern European countries. Poland, Hungary and Yugoslaviaalready have the arrangement.   Mazilu was under house arrest when Ceausescu was overthrown andsaid he, his wife and son were in danger of execution. His motherand a brother had been killed by the Ceausescu government, he added.   He was among the first leaders of the interim government butresigned a month later because, he said, ``Stalinists'' were takingit over. He rejoined the National Salvation Front on Feb. 1 whenmembers of political parties in addition to communists were added.   Mazilu, a law professor, heads a group writing a newconstitution and an election law for the voting due on May 20.</TEXT></DOC>
