For the specific case of an abradable sealoperating in the temperature range 650-850 C, the use of a thermal sprayeddeposit of an alloy composite powder consisting of a bentonite core particlecoated with an alloy layer of NiCrAl is described. A series of testswere carried out to arrive at an optimum combination of abradability,erosion resistance, and oxidation resistance in the thermal sprayed deposit.The selected composite powder consists of a closely sized bentonite corein the range 75-150 microns, coated with an alloy consisting of Ni5 pctCr3 pct Al, such that the alloy coating to core ratio is 80:20 by weight.When flame sprayed by standard practice this powder was found to producean abradable seal with the optimum combination of desired properties.9 references.</TEXT></DOC>
