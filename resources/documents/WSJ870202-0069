Many mutual fund complexes are offering, or are about to offer, some sort of &quot;grand allocator&quot; product aimed at investors who grow weak at the thought of trying to diversify their retirement-plan holdings and other assets.    These funds divide their assets into different groups such as stocks, bonds and money market funds. In some cases, each sector has its own fund manager.    Claremont Fund's Combined Portfolio, for instance, pits the three independent money managers who each run one-third of the $10.2 million fund against one another.    &quot;It's a very sexy sell,&quot; Deborah Allen Olivier, chairwoman of the California-based fund, says. But Mrs. Olivier concedes that the fund isn't for everyone. Even though it invests in &quot;high-quality stocks,&quot; she says, it does &quot;bounce around.&quot;    Last year, it underperformed its main benchmark, an average of a government bond index and the Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. 500-stock index, largely because one manager &quot;did much less well than the others,&quot; she says. She and others say such funds are designed largely for long-term investors.    PaineWebber Group Inc. recently brought out a fund using its own allocation models, and Blanchard Strategic Growth Fund employs an allocator who apportions money across five markets.    Some other complexes are reviving the &quot;fund of funds&quot; concept, in which a fund buys stakes in other funds rather than in individual stocks and bonds. That approach was popularized in the 1960s by international financier Bernard Cornfeld but was abandoned after the collapse of his empire.    After much paper-rattling with regulators, Vanguard Group reintroduced the idea in mid-1985 with its STAR Fund, marketed for individual retirement accounts. Now, T. Rowe Price andamp; Associates has a similar fund in the regulatory pipeline, as do others.    Larry Biehl, a director of Bailard, Biehl andamp; Kaiser Inc., a San Mateo, Calif.-based money manager, says the big mutual fund complexes created &quot;an attractive nuisance&quot; with their big families of funds. Now they're creating a way to manage those families.    But Mr. Biehl says there are potential problems with the allocator strategy. Being excessively diversified can thin out returns, for one. And having several managers trying to play on falling interest rates, for instance, can make the fund too exposed to interest rate risk.    Besides, Mr. Biehl says, it's debatable whether active money managers can beat the passive index his firm compiles. In the past 20 years, the index -- which holds an equal weighting in five markets -- has outpaced U.S. stocks and the average portfolio manager.    Nonetheless, the index can be beaten. &quot;We're kind of playing both sides of the fence,&quot; Mr. Biehl says. Bailard Biehl's privately managed accounts, he says, have outpaced the index over an 18-year period, and the company recently launched a mutual fund for smaller investors with the same objective.    ---   IT WASN'T IN THE MAIL: Horace Mann Short Term Money Market Fund neglected to report a year-end income dividend to Lipper Analytical Services Inc., and the fund consequently sank to the bottom of the money market fund performance list, with a total return of just 2.99%. However, logging the 32-cent payout improved the fund's gain to 5.86%, lifting it out of last place.    ---       FUNDS THAT SPREAD ASSETS AMONG VARIOUS MARKETS                                         1986 4th   1986 Fund                                    Quarter    Year Vanguard STAR (a set combination   of its funds)                          +3.66%   +13.93% Blanchard Strategic* (allocator   and multiple managers)                 +3.36    + 7.75 Claremont Combined (competitive   multiple managers)                     +3.75    +12.06 Rightime Fund (market timer in funds)    +4.24    +11.44 Average of all equity funds              +3.32%   +15.90% Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index**      +5.61    +18.71 Bailard, Biehl andamp; Kaiser diversified   portfolio index***                      n.a.    +23.30   *Performance since start-up in mid-1986   **With dividends reinvested   ***Index consists equally of U.S. stocks, foreign stocks,U.S. corporate and government bonds, real estate and Treasurybills.
