The first record of the spotted owl was madein 1858 in the west end of the Tehachapi Mountains in southern California(Xantus 1859). It was first observed in the Pacific Northwest in 1892 (Bent1938). Though observed only occasionally prior to the 1970's, northernspotted owls since that time have been found to be more common in certaintypes of forested habitat throughout its range (USDA 1986).Although a secretive and mostly nocturnal bird, the northern spotted owlis apparently unafraid of humans (Bent 1938, Forsman <T3>et al</T3>. 1984, USDA 1986). The spotted owl is site-tenacious andmaintains a territory year-round: however, in some cases, individuals maymigrate seasonally on a local basis, changing their home range size orlocation between the summer and winter. Monogamous and long-lived, spottedowls tend to mate for life, although it is not known if pair-bonding orsite-tenacity is the determining factor. The adult female is slightly largerthan the male.Spotted owls are perch-and-dive predators and over 50 percent of theirprey items are arboreal or semiarboreal species. Spotted owls subsist ona variety of mammals, birds, reptiles, and insects, with small mammalssuch as flying squirrels (<T3>Glaucomys sabrinus</T3>), red tree voles <T3>(Arborimus longicaudus</T3>) and dusky-footed woodrats (<T3>Neotoma fuscipes</T3>) making up the bulk of the food items throughoutthe species' range (Solis and Gutierrez 1982, Forsman <T3>et al</T3>. 1984, Barrows 1985).Three subspecies of the spotted owl currently are recognized by the AmericanOrnithologists' Union (1957): the northern spotted owl (<T3>Strix occidentalis caurina</T3>), the California spotted owl (<T3>S. o. occidentalis</T3>), and the Mexican spotted owl (<T3>S. o. lucida</T3>). Northern spotted owls are distinguished from theother subspecies by their darker brown color and smaller white spots andmarkings (Merriam 1898, Nelson 1903, Bent 1938). Juvenile plumage is similarto adult plumage except for ragged white downy tips on the tail feathersof the juvenile. Oberholser (1915) reported that there was considerableoverlap in color of plumage between the northern and California spottedowl subspecies in California. The geographical separation between thesetwo subspecies presumably occurs within a 12-to-15-mile gap of forestedhabitat between southeastern Shasta and northwestern Lassen National Forests,where the Sierra Nevada contacts the Klamath physiographic province; thePit River is generally accepted as the boundary between the two Californiasubspecies (USDA 1986; G. Gould, California Dept. of Fish and Game, Sacramento,CA, pers. comm.).Barrowclough (1987) examined available museum specimens of all three spottedowl subspecies to investigate geographical variation within and betweenthese taxa. In his unpublished findings, he reported clinal variation overthe range of the northern and California subspecies and questioned thevalidity of considering these two taxa as distinct subspecies. It shouldbe noted that Barrowclough's (1987) draft manuscript has yet to be acceptedand published, and that the Service generally relies on the latest publishedinformation in peer-reviewed ornithological journals to establish taxonomicaffinities. Although the geographical separation between the northern andCalifornia subspecies is within the dispersal capabilities of the owl (E.C.Meslow, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Coop. Unit, Oregon State Univ.,Corvallis, OR, pers. comm.), there are no data available to determine whethergenetic exchange occurs between the two subspecies in California.Spotted owls usually do not nest every year nor are nesting pairs successfulevery year. Early nesting behavior begins in February to March with nestingoccurring March to June. The average clutch size is 2 eggs, with a rangeof 1 to 4. A 1:1 sex ratio of adult males to adult females is assumed fromknown data. Fledging occurs from mid-May to late June, with parental carecontinuing into September. Females are capable of breeding as 2-year-olds,but most probably do not breed until they are at least 3 years of age (Barrows1985, Miller and 1985b, Franklin <T3>et al</T3>. 1986). A few subadult males have been observed paired withadult females (Wagner and Meslow 1986, Miller and Meslow 1985b). Malesdo most of the foraging during incubation and assist with foraging duringthe fledging period.Reproduction by spotted owls has fluctuated dramatically from year to yearin some areas (Forsman <T3>et al</T3>. 1984, Barrows 1985, USDA 1986, Allen <T3>et al</T3>. 1987). In some years most pairs may breed, whereas in otheryears very few pairs even attempt to nest. Gutierrez <T3>et al</T3>. (1984) noted a broad failure in reproduction from northernCalifornia through Washington in 1982. It has been suggested that fluctuationsin reproduction and numbers of pairs breeding may be related to fluctuationsin prey availability (Forsman <T3>et al</T3>. 1984, Barrows 1985, Gutierrez 1985). Both the proportionof pairs occupying territories that attempt to breed and the proportionof pairs attempting to breed that are successful (i.e., fledge young) varyfrom year to year (Franklin <T3>et al</T3>. 1987; Forsman <T3>et al</T3>. 1984; Meslow <T3>et al</T3>. 1986; The Washington Department of Wildlife 1987; Millerand Meslow 1985b; Gutierrez <T3>et al</T3>. 1984; G.S. Miller, pers. comm.). Average reproductive ratesfor Oregon and California (Marcot 1986) range from 0.49 to 0.67 juvenilesper pair (Franklin <T3>et al</T3>. 1987; Marcot and Holthausen 1987; Forsman <T3>et al</T3>. 1984; Gutierrez <T3>et al</T3>. 1985a; Barrowclough and Coats 1985).Mortality rates of juveniles are significantly higher than adult rates(Forsman <T3>et al</T3>. 1984, Miller and Meslow 1985a and 1986b, Gutierrez <T3>et al</T3>. 1985a and b). Recent studies of juvenile dispersal in Oregonand California indicate that few of the juvenile spotted owls survivedto reproduce (Gutierrez <T3>et al</T3>. 1985a and b, Miller and Meslow 1985a and b, 1986b). Theseresearch studies all report very high mortality during predispersal andthe first months of dispersal. In one study, out of 48 juveniles radiotrackedduring a 3-year study, only 3 were known to be alive after 1 year (thefate of 6 was unknown because transmitter signals were lost) (Meslow andMiller 1986b). Twelve of 23 juveniles in a 2-year study in California diedduring the dispersal period; the fate of the other 11 was unknown (Gutierrez<T3>et al</T3>. 1985b). It is not known whether the use of radio transmittersattached to juveniles for tracking purposes contribute to juvenile mortality(Irwin 1987; Dawson <T3>et al</T3>. 1986); researchers using this technique believe it shouldnot measurably influence juvenile survival if done properly (Meslow, pers.comm.).Using the data for the few years available, Marcot and Holthausen (1987)estimated that about 60 percent of juveniles live until they disperse fromtheir nesting areas, but only about 18 percent of those fledged survivefor 1 year. Miller and Meslow's (1986a) 4-year study in Oregon estimatedfirst year post-dispersal survival at 19 percent. Gutierrez <T3>et al</T3>. (1985b) estimated a maximum of 50 percent survival in Californiabased on 2 years of data, while Marcot (1986) estimated overall survivalof juvenile owls from hatching through the first year of life at 11 to12 percent.The current range of the northern spotted owl is from southwestern BritishColumbia, western Washington, western Oregon, and northern California southto San Francisco Bay. The southeastern boundary of its range, separatingthis subspecies from the California spotted owl, is the Pit River areaof Shasta County, California. Populations are not evenly distributed throughoutits present range. The majority of individuals is found in the Cascadesof Oregon and the Klamath Mountains in southwestern Oregon and northwesternCalifornia (USDA 1988; Gould, pers. comm.; USDI 1989). This area representsthe core of the present range of this subspecies. Evidently, northern spottedowls reach their highest population densities and have their best reproductivesuccess in suitable habitat in this part of their range (Franklin and Gutierrez1988; Franklin <T3>et al</T3>. 1989; Miller and Meslow 1988; USDI 1987, 1989; Robertson1989). Habitat in southwestern Oregon begins to change south of Roseburgto a drier Douglas-fir/mixed conifer habitat with a corresponding changein prey base (from flying squirrels to woodrats) (Meslow, pers. comm.).In addition, historical logging practices in the mixed conifer zone consistedof more selective timber harvesting than in other areas, leaving remnantstands of old growth or stands of varying ages with old-growth characteristics;this situation is also present along the east side of the Cascades in Washington.Northern Washington and southern British Columbia represent the northernextent of the range of the northern subspecies; population densities andnumbers are lowest in these areas. Very few pairs have been located inBritish Columbia; all have been located near the United States border.Few owls (pairs or singles) are presently found in the Coast Ranges insouthwestern Washington or in the northwestern Oregon Coast Ranges (northfrom the southern portion of the Siuslaw National Forest). The populationalso decreases in size and density toward its southern extreme along thecoast range in Marin, Napa, and Sonoma Counties, California. Little dataon numbers and distribution on private, State, or tribal lands in theseareas are available, although the spotted owl may have been nearly extirpatedfrom much of these lands due to reduction of old-growth habitat (Forsman1986; E. Forsman, USDA Forest Service, Pacific NW Research Station, Olympia,WA, pers. comm.; Gould, pers. comm.).The northern spotted owl is known from most of the major types of coniferousforests in the Pacific Northwest (Forsman <T3>et al.</T3> 1977, 1984; Forsman and Meslow 1985; Gould 1974, 1975,1979; Garcia 1979; Marcot and Gardetto 1980; Solis 1983; Sisco and Gutierrez1984; Gutierrez <T3>et al. </T3>1984). The historical range of the northern spotted owlextended throughout the coniferous forest region from southwestern BritishColumbia south through western Washington, western Oregon, and the CoastRanges of California to San Francisco Bay (USDA 1986). The current rangeand distribution of the northern subspecies is similar to the historicalrange where forested habitat still exists. The owl has been extirpatedor is uncommon in certain areas as the result of decline or modificationof old-growth and mature habitat and thus its distribution is now discontinuousover its range (Dawson <T3>et al.</T3> 1986, Forsman 1986).In California, northern spotted owls most commonly use the Douglas-fir(<T3>Pseudotsuga menziesii</T3>) and mixed conifer forest types (Marcotand Gardetto 1980, Solis 1983, and Gutierrez 1985). Gould (1974) reportedfinding spotted owls in northwestern California in coast redwood (<T3>Sequoia sempervirens</T3>), Douglas-fir and Bishop pine (<T3>Pinus muricata</T3>) forests, and also in stands dominated by ponderosapine (<T3>Pinus ponderosa</T3>). In Washington's coastal forest, the spottedowl is found in forests dominated by Douglas-fir and western hemlock (<T3>Tsuga heterophylla</T3>). At higher elevations in western Washington,Pacific silver fir (<T3>Abies amabilis</T3>) is commonly used by owls whereas on the east sideof the Cascades Douglas-fir and grand fir (<T3>Abies grandis</T3>) are used (Postovit 1977). Availability of foresttypes within a region may be responsible for the observed differences inuse among types (Gutierrez 1985; Meslow <T3>et al.</T3> 1986). Gould (pers. comm.) observed that preferred habitatparticularly in California is not continuous, but occurs naturally in amosaic pattern, especially in the southern portions of the State.Spotted owls have been observed over a wide range of elevations, althoughthey seem to avoid higher elevation, subalpine forests (USDA 1986). Garcia(1979) reports that spotted owl densities in Washington were greatest below4,100 feet elevation. Postovit (1977) found owls on the Olympic Peninsulaat elevations ranging from 70 to 3,200 feet and an elevation range of 1,600to 4,200 feet in the Cascade Mountains of Washington. On the east sideof Washington's Cascades, J. Casson (USDA Forest Service, Wenatchee N.F.,WA, pers. comm.) found owls up to 5,000 feet elevation and almost alwaysin association with Douglas-fir. Northern spotted owls have been observedoccasionally at elevations up to 6,000 feet or more in California (Gould,pers. comm.).Preferred forest habitat used by spotted owls is generally characterizedby the presence of a multi-layered stand structure, dense tree canopy closure,and large trees with cavities or broken tops. These are characteristicsthat generally typify old-growth forests, although some old-growth characteristicspreferred by spotted owls may appear in mature forests. Old-growth standstend to have a high degree of decadence with abundant standing and downdead trees, and supporting a high density of prey species (Forsman 1976,1980; Gould 1977; Postovit 1977; Barrows and Barrows 1978; Garcia 1979;USDA 1986; Barrows 1981; Solis and Gutierrez 1982; Forsman <T3>et al.</T3> 1984; Gutierrez <T3>et al.</T3> 1984; Carey 1985; Ruediger 1985).Northern spotted owl preferences for old-growth forests and forests withold-growth characteristics have been established using different typesof information, including relative abundance, proportion of occupied sitescontaining old growth, and allocation of time. For the coniferous forestwithin the range of the northern spotted owl, young or second-growth forestis generally defined as less than 100 years of age, mature forest as standsfrom 100 to 200 years old, and old growth as forest more than 200 yearsold. Forsman <T3>et al.</T3> (1977) computed the relative abundance of spotted owlsin Oregon, and found that densities of spotted owl pairs were 12 timeshigher in old growth than in young-growth forests. Of 1,502 observationsof owls, Forsman <T3>et al.</T3> (1987) found that 1,282 were in old growth, 22 in matureforest, 131 in old-growth/mature forest, and 67 in stands less than 100years of age, demonstrating an overwhelming preference for old growth (USDI1989). Pairs were evident at 928 of these 1,502 sites. Other studies byForsman <T3>et al. </T3>(1984, 1987) analyzed the habitat characteristics of spottedowl sites in Oregon and observed that more than 90 percent of sites occupiedby owls contained a major component of old-growth forest. Similar studiesconducted by Marcot and Gardetto (1980) in northern California found that95 percent of spotted owl sites were in old-growth stands. Ninety-sevenpercent of the spotted owl population in Washington was found in old-growth/matureforest; there were no known reproductive pairs in managed second-growthforest (Allen 1988). Many apparently suitable sites are not occupied everyyear. Marcot and Holthausen (1987) compared percent occurrence of occupancyto amount of area in old growth at each site. The results of their analysisshowed probability of use is positively correlated with the percent ofarea containing old-growth forest types.Forsman <T3>et al.</T3> (1984) analyzed home range data for eight radio-equippedadult spotted owls in the H.J. Andrews Study Area on the west slope ofthe Cascade Range. Home range is defined as an area within which the activitiesof an animal are confined. Whereas the percent of old-growth conifer forestin their home ranges varied from 33 to 66 percent, the percent of timespent foraging in old growth by the eight owls ranged from 85 to 99 percent,demonstrating a non-random use and pronounced preference for old growth.All eight owls foraged in old-growth conifer forest significantly morethan expected based upon availability of that habitat relative to otherhabitat types in the study area. Use of 5- to 60-year-old stands was significantlyless than expected except in the case of a single bird whose use of a smallportion of 31- to 60-year-old forest within its range was in direct proportionto availability. Recent clearcuts or burned areas were rarely used (Forsman<T3>et al.</T3> 1984). Similar trends have been noted for northern spottedowls in the Coast Range of Oregon (Forsman <T3>et al.</T3> 1984; Reid <T3>et al.</T3> 1987), and the Klamath and Cascade Mountains (Meslow <T3>et al.</T3> 1986).In addition, this preference for old growth has been evident from observationsof roosting owls as well as during the dispersal period by juveniles. Inanalyzing dispersal patterns by juvenile owls, Miller (1989) found thatthe 18 radio-equipped individuals he studied used a variety of habitats.However, 12 of the 18 birds selected old-growth/mature forests significantlymore than expected based on availability. Forsman <T3>et al. </T3>(1984) reported that 97.6 percent of 1,098 adult spottedowl roost sites in the central Oregon Cascades were in old-growth forest;91 percent of 555 roost sites on BLM Coast Ranges forests were in old growth.Although the literature strongly supports the generalization that owlspreferentially select old-growth forests over young growth (USDI 1989),there are records of owls using young-growth forests. These data on young-growthforests have led to questions on the importance of old-growth habitat tospotted owl populations (e.g., Irwin 1987). In addition to the studiesnoted earlier (Irwin <T3>et al. </T3>1989a), Irwin <T3>et al. </T3>(1989b) examined the immediate vicinity surrounding andincluding 29 nest sites on the Wenatchee and Okanogan National Forestsin the Washington Cascades. Each of these nests apparently had successfullyfledged at least one young in 1987 and/or 1988. The authors noted thatwhile characteristics of many of these sites did not completely coincidewith the general description of old growth, most of the sites retaineddense, multi-layered canopies; no estimate was made of the amount of oldgrowth within the home ranges of the owls whose nest sites were includedin the analysis. As noted earlier, the presence of a dense, multi-layeredcanopy is an important structural characteristic typical of old-growthforests. Surveys in the northern third of the Oregon Coast Ranges (Forsman1986) and in southwestern Washington (Irwin <T3>et al.</T3> 1989a) revealed a low density of spotted owls within thisportion of their range and a paucity of old-growth habitat in this area,suggesting that this type of habitat (i.e., 40- to 120-year-old managedforest or predominantly young-growth forest) is not preferred or suitablehabitat for northern spotted owls. Northern spotted owls have relatively large home ranges. Researchers, usingradiotelemetry techniques, have recorded home range sizes used by adultspotted owls ranging from approximately 300 acres to more than 19,000 acres(Solis 1983; Forsman <T3>et al.</T3> 1984; Sisco and Gutierrez 1984; Allen and Brewer 1985;Forsman and Meslow 1985; Brewer 1985; Forsman 1986; Meslow <T3>et al. </T3>1986; Allen <T3>et al. 1987; </T3>Reid <T3>et al. </T3>1987; N. Tilghman, USDA Forest Service, Redwoods SciencesResearch Station, Arcata, CA, pers. comm.). In a sample of 14 pairs ofnorthern spotted owls in the Coast Ranges of Oregon, A. Carey (USDA ForestService, Pacific NW Research Station, Olympia, WA, pers. comm.) calculatedmean home range size to be 5,425 acres of which 2,549 acres were old growth.Estimated mean home range size for northern spotted owl pairs ranges from1,700 acres in northwestern California to about 12,500 acres on the OlympicPeninsula (USDI 1987, 1989). The estimated mean home range size and amountof included preferred habitat is smaller for a single bird than for a pairin those areas studied (USDA 1988). In general, home range sizes are smallestduring the spring and summer (reproductive period), largest during thefall and winter (non-reproductive), increase from south to north, and increasewith increasing elevation. Pairs of owls may also occupy overlapping homeranges (Forsman <T3>et al. </T3>1984; Solis 1983).Significantly, research indicates that spotted owls on the Olympic Peninsulaand Oregon Coast Ranges consistently occupy larger home ranges than owlsin the other provinces. These areas also have the fewest pairs of spottedowls and the least remaining old-growth forest (USDA 1989). The large homerange sizes reported for owl pairs on the Olympic Peninsula, Oregon CoastRanges, and on the west side of the Cascade Range in Washington (USDI 1989)may reflect: (1) The adverse influence of forest fragmentation resultingfrom timber harvest; and (2) the fact that the Washington locations arenear the periphery of the subspecies' range. Forests within these provincesare highly fragmented and have the least amount of old-growth forest remainingwithin the range of the owl. For example, on the Siuslaw National Forest,located within the Coast Ranges of Oregon, remaining old-growth timberoccurs in widely separated and relatively small parcels (Harris 1984).In this area, the owls utilize the available old growth in a highly fragmentedand patchy environment (Friesen and Meslow 1988). This pattern is probablytrue for the Olympic Peninsula as well. The above findings and those ofAllen and Brewer (1985), Forsman <T3>et al. </T3>(1984), Carey (1985), and Dawson <T3>et al.</T3> (1986), suggest that home range size increases as qualityand quantity per unit area of preferred habitat declines (USDI 1989).There are no estimates of the historical population size and distributionof the northern spotted owl within preferred habitat, although spottedowls are believed to have inhabited most old-growth forests throughoutthe Pacific Northwest prior to modern settlement (mid-1800s), includingnorthwestern California (USDI 1989). Spotted owls are still found withintheir historical range in most areas where preferred and suitable habitatexist, although most of the owls are restricted within this range to matureand old-growth forests managed by the Federal government. Over 90 percentof the known number of spotted owls have been located on federally managedlands (Forsman <T3>et al</T3>. 1987; USDA 1988; USDI 1989; Gould, pers. comm.). Littleinformation is available on numbers and distribution of owls on private,State, or tribal lands in these areas, although the spotted owl may benearly extirpated from much of these lands due to reduction of old-growthhabitat (Forsman 1986; Forsman, pers. comm.; Gould, pers. comm.).<ITAG tagnum="84">Petition Process Background</ITAG>On January 28, 1987, the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) received apetition submitted by Greenworld requesting the listing of the northernspotted owl (<T3>Strix occidentalis caurina</T3>) as an endangered species under theEndangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>) (Act). On July 23, 1987, the Service accepted the Greenworldpetition as presenting substantial information indicating that listingmight be warranted and initiated a status review.On August 4, 1987, the Service received a second petition, submitted bythe Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, Inc. on behalf of 29 conservation organizations,requesting that the populations of northern spotted owls on the OlympicPeninsula in Washington and the Coast Ranges of Oregon be listed as endangeredpursuant to the Act, and that the subspecies be listed as threatened throughoutthe remainder of its range in Washington, Oregon, and northern California.The Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, Inc. requested that its petition beconsolidated with the petition by Greenworld. In accordance with its establishedpolicy, the Service treated this second petition as a public comment tobe considered in evaluating the original listing petition. As a result,the time frames and schedules required by the first petition remained thesame. Both petitions sought the designation of critical habitat.Section 4(b)(3) of the Act requires the Secretary of the Interior to reacha final decision on any petition accepted for review within 12 months ofits receipt. In conducting its review, the Service published a notice inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>(52 FR 34396) on September 11, 1987, requestingpublic comments and biological data on the status of the northern spottedowl. In addition, a status review team of three Service biologists wasestablished. This team reviewed and evaluated all comments and informationreceived in response to the September 11 notice as well as all other informationin the Service's files or gathered in the effort to review the status ofthe subspecies. Two sequential drafts of the status review were preparedby the Service team and submitted for review by scientists, researchers,and others knowledgeable about the spotted owl in the Pacific Northwest.On December 14, 1987, the Service team completed its status review on thenorthern spotted owl. On December 17, 1987, the Service's Regional Directorfor Region 1 made a finding, based on the review, that listing the northernspotted owl pursuant to Section 4(b)(3)(B)(i) of the Act was not warrantedat that time. The Regional Director noted that because of the need forpopulation trend information and other biological data, high priority wouldbe given to this subspecies for continued monitoring and further research.Notice of this finding was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on December 23, 1987 (52 FR 48552).On May 5, 1988, the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, Inc. filed suit onbehalf of 23 environmental organizations in the U.S. District Court forthe Western District of Washington (Northern Spotted Owl v. Hodel, No.C88-573Z, W.D., Wash. 1988) challenging the Service's finding on the listingpetitions. In an order issued on November 17, 1988, the Court concludedthat the Service's finding was arbitrary and capricious or contrary tolaw, and remanded the matter to the Service for further review. The Servicewas specifically ordered to: provide an analysis and explanation for itsfinding; explain the reasoning for not listing the owl as threatened; andto supplement its status review and petition finding.On December 5, 1988, the Director of the Service established a new statusreview team, consisting of 12 Service biologists, to conduct an in-depthreview and interpretation of all data and other information that had beenmade available to the Service in 1987 on the issue. After reviewing the1987 administrative record, the Service concluded that there was considerablenew information available that had not been present in the original recordand that such information was needed to respond sufficiently to the Court'srequest and to meet the Act's requirement to evaluate the best availablebiological information. In an order issued on January 12, 1989, the Courtgranted the Service's request to reopen the administrative record for thestatus review and petition finding for a period not to extend beyond February28, 1989. The Service published a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (54 FR 4049; January 27, 1989) reopening thestatus review and soliciting comments, data, and other information. Inits order of January 12, the Court gave the Service until May 1, 1989,to complete the additional status review, supplement the status reviewreport, and submit to the court a new analysis and finding on the petitionto list the northern spotted owl as endangered or threatened. On April21, 1989, the team completed the review and submitted a supplemental statusreview report to the Regional Director, Region 1, Fish and Wildlife Service.On April 25, 1989, the Regional Director issued a revised petition findingindicating that listing the northern spotted owl as a threatened speciesthroughout its entire range is warranted and that the Service would pursuepromptly the listing process for the species. This proposal constitutesthe final revised finding for the petitioned action.The entire spotted owl species (<T3>Strix occidentalis</T3>) is listed on the Service's Notice of Reviewfor vertebrate wildlife as a candidate species for listing, category 2.A category 2 species is one for which listing may be appropriate but additionalinformation is needed. The information submitted and reviewed as part ofthe status review process for the northern spotted owl contributed to thesupplemental information needed on which to base a decision to proposethis subspecies for listing. <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species </ITAG>Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq</T3>.) and regulations promulgated to implement the listingprovisions of the Act (50 CFR Part 424) set forth the procedures for addingspecies to the Federal lists. A species may be determined to be an endangeredor threatened species due to one or more of the five factors describedin Section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the northernspotted owl (<T3>Strix occidentalis caurina</T3>) are as follows: A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailmentof Its Habitat or Range Western Oregon and Washington were covered by approximately 24 to 28 millionacres of forest at the time of modern settlement (early to mid-1800's),of which about 70 percent (14 to 19 million acres) may have been old growth(Society of American Foresters Task Force 1983, Spies and Franklin 1988,Morrison 1988, Norse 1988). Historical estimates for northwestern Californiaare not as precise, but suggest there were between 1.3 and 3.2 millionacres of old-growth Douglas-fir/mixed conifer and about 2.2 million acresof old-growth coastal redwood (Society of American Foresters Task Force1983, Laudenslayer 1985, Fox 1988, California Department of Forestry andFire Protection 1988, Morrison 1988). An estimated 70 to 80 percent reduction in old-growth forests has occurredsince the time of modern settlement in Oregon and Washington (USDI 1989).Old-growth forests in the Douglas-fir/mixed conifer region of northwesternCalifornia may have undergone a similar reduction of about 45 to 80 percentsince the mid-1800's (Laudenslayer 1985; Green 1985; Fox 1988; CaliforniaDepartment of Forestry and Fire Protection 1988). Some recent estimates(Spies and Franklin 1988, Morrison 1988, Norse 1988) suggest that thisreported decline in historical habitat, in fact, may have been as highas 83 to 88 percent. Habitat reduction has not been uniform throughoutthe range of the spotted owl, but has been concentrated at lower elevationsand the Coast Ranges. Reduction of old growth is largely attributable totimber harvesting and land conversion practices, although natural perturbations,such as forest fires, have caused losses as well. Current surveys and inventories have shown that while northern spottedowls are not found in all old-growth forests, nor exclusively in old-growthforests, they are overwhelmingly associated with forests of this age andstructure (USDI 1989). Therefore, trends in amount and distribution ofold-growth forests may be used as a reasonable indicator of trends in theabundance and distribution of spotted owl populations and habitat overtime. By examining the trends in old-growth forest reduction from the mid-1800'sto the present, the Service has extrapolated the loss of old-growth andmature habitat to the middle of the next century (USDI 1989). Based onthe assumption that current timber harvest management practices and rateswill continue, most commercial old-growth and mature forests (those availablefor commercial logging) will have been logged and converted to youngerstands by the year 2050. Since over 90 percent of presently known spottedowl occurrences and habitat are found on federally managed lands (Forsman<T3>et al</T3>. 1987), future estimates are based upon average annual loggingrates and published trend estimates for federal lands only. Relativelyspeaking, little old growth presently exists on private, State, or triballands (Society of American Foresters Task Force 1983; Old-Growth DefinitionTask Group 1986; Morrison 1988; Spies and Franklin 1988; California Departmentof Forestry and Fire Protection 1988; Thomas <T3>et al</T3>. 1988; Greene 1988). In addition, current logging practices,such as clearcutting, even-aged management, and short logging rotations,preclude development of future old-growth conditions from existing youngforest stands. These non-federal lands historically might have containeda significant amount of owl habitat and may still offer the opportunityto provide vital linkages between islands of federally managed habitatin many areas.At the current rate of timber harvest, the existing old-growth and maturehabitat of the northern spotted owl throughout its range is expected todecline by an additional 50 to 60 percent between 1989 and 2050, from anestimated 7 million acres currently to about 2.7 million acres (USDI 1989).This would represent a total decline of at least 80 to 85 percent fromthe amount of spotted owl habitat originally estimated for the westernpart of the Pacific Northwest, including northern California. The figuresused to derive this estimate do not include any young-growth forest acreagesthat might develop old-growth characteristics or conditions during thenext 60 years (USDI 1989); as noted earlier, however, conversion of youngerhabitat to old-growth condition is not expected to be significant unlesscurrent logging practices change (Beuter <T3>et al</T3>. 1976; Heinrichs 1983; Society of American Foresters TaskForce 1983; Harris 1984; Spies and Franklin 1988). As a result of habitatfragmentation, reduction in individual stand size, and edge effects, ithas been speculated that the amount of biologically effective habitat presentlyavailable for the spotted owl (i.e., habitat patches of sufficient sizeto support reproductively successful owls) may actually be less than 50percent of the total preferred habitat remaining today. This reductionin the quality of remaining forest habitat under present logging patternswill continue to the point where less than 10 percent of historical levelsremains (Harris 1984; Harris <T3>et al</T3>. 1982; Morrison 1988, 1989; Norse 1988). Under current management plans, the distribution of spotted owl habitatremaining by the year 2050 will closely coincide with National Parks, reservedareas on federally managed forests, or other lands that are not consideredsuitable or available for timber harvest for other reasons (e.g., landstoo steep or rocky for timber production, lands needed for hydrologic protection,scenic areas, etc.). These areas will contribute to maintaining spottedowl populations only to the extent that they contain suitable habitat ofadequate size and quality for the birds (USDI 1989). By then, most remainingpreferred habitat will not longer be continuous, but will exist as islandsof varying size, spacing, and suitability spread over the range of thesubspecies. Many of the current wilderness areas and parks are largelyhigh-elevation lands above timberline. Lands unsuited for timber productionmay have poor soil conditions or be too steep or rocky; such areas generallyare not suitable habitat for spotted owls nor are they likely to effectivelysupport successfully reproducing pairs of owls (Meslow, pers. comm.) To achieve the primary objective of timber management in Oregon, Washington,and northern California of producing wood at a non-declining rate, forestsmust be intensively managed with average cutting rotations of 70 to 120years (USDI 1984, USDA 1988). Current preferred timber harvest systemsemphasize dispersed clearcut patches for even-age management as the patternof harvest. Thus, public forest lands that are intensively managed fortimber production are, in general, not allowed to develop ``old-growthcharacteristics,'' which require about 200 years to develop. As a result,loss and fragmentation of remaining forests and old-growth stands suitablefor spotted owls will continue if current management practices are unchanged.Annual cutting rates of old-growth and old-growth/mature age classes oftrees have been established by the Forest Service and the Bureau of LandManagement (Bureau) (USDI 1989). During the 1980's, the Bureau has beenharvesting old-growth and old-growth/mature trees at the rate of about22,000 acres per year in Oregon. The Forest Service estimates its harvestingof spotted owl habitat (mature and old-growth classes) at the rate of about36,000 to 40,000 acres per year in Oregon and Washington combined, and12,000 acres annually in California. Several legal actions against theForest Service and the Bureau delayed harvest in 1988 and 1989. Unlessthese cutting rates or patterns of cutting are altered, that portion ofexisting spotted owl habitat remaining that is available for timber harvestwill be gone within about 60 years (USDI 1989). As a result of past and present harvest patterns, potential isolation ofseveral subpopulations of northern spotted owls is also of considerableconcern (e.g., the Olympic Peninsula, the Coast Ranges in southwesternWashington and northwestern Oregon, and the Marin County area in California)(USDA 1988, USDI 1989). The central problem of subpopulation isolationis one of maintaining a critical population size level in the absence ofgenetic or demographic contributions from other subpopulations. The smallera population of subpopulation and the greater its isolation from otherpopulations, the greater the risk of its elimination as a result of chancedemographic and environmental events or genetic effects (Shaffer 1987b).The population of spotted owls on the Olympic Peninsula may be isolateddemographically, and perhaps even genetically, from other owl populations,since there does not appear to be an effective, self-sustaining populationin either southwestern Washington adjacent to the Olympic Peninsula orthe northwestern Oregon Coast Ranges (Irwin <T3>et al</T3>. 1988, 1989a; A. Potter, Wash. Dept. of Wildlife, Olympia,WA, pers. comm.; Forsman <T3>et al</T3>. 1977; Forsman 1986; W. Logan, Bureau of Land Management,Salem, OR, pers. comm.). While the population in the Oregon Coast Rangesmay not be currently isolated due to a tenuous connection to the Cascadepopulations at the southern part of the range provided by lands managedby the Bureau, the scale of habitat fragmentation throughout the rangeis of considerable concern USDI 1989). As one moves north along the OregonCoast Ranges, habitat ownership becomes fragmented because of checkerboardingof Bureau and private lands and remaining old growth and mature forestsbecome more fragmented as well. During the next 10 to 15 years, given theexisting direction of land management, the current degree of isolationon the Olympic Peninsula and the potential for isolation of portions ofthe Oregon Coast Ranges province are likely to become exacerbated, as mostintervening habitat is privately owned. The Washington and Oregon Cascade populations of owls are at risk of becomingdemographically isolated from one another by loss of habitat along theColumbia River corridor. The impounded section of the Columbia River upstreamof Bonneville Dam and the associated transportation and urban/agriculturalcorridor downstream from Bonneville Dam may serve as a significant dispersalbarrier to the north-south movement of owls. In addition, the ColumbiaRiver downstream from Portland is very wide with little or no old-growthand mature habitat adjacent to the river, nor is there a viable owl populationin this area (Logan, pers. comm.; Forsman <T3>et al</T3>. 1977; Forsman 1986; Potter, pers. comm.). In California,isolation of spotted owls may be as great in the tri-county area of Marin,Sonoma, and Napa Counties as it is on the Olympic Peninsula or in the OregonCoast Ranges (Bontadelli 1989, Gould, pers. comm.). Most remaining private forest lands as well as much of the publicly ownedlands in the range of the northern spotted owl no longer provide continuousparcels of preferred habitat, primarily due to logging practices resultingin fragmentation of the owl's forest habitat. Habitat fragmentation maybe defined as the breakup of contiguous tracts of forest habitat into smaller,more isolated parcels (USDI 1989). Timber harvest, employing a patternof small, dispersed clearcuts, eventually leads to a situation where parcelsizes are so small as to be influenced by edge effects (windthrow, invasionby alien species, microclimatic changes, etc.). As a result, the originalparcels may no longer be able to sustain the species or the community originallyfound in the larger and contiguous tracts of habitat and the quality (i.e.,biological effectiveness of the habitat to support successful reproduction)of remaining preferred forest stands may be lessened considerably whenthe effects of adjacent roads and clearcuts are considered. Impacts fromedge effects and environmental disturbances may be most noticeable in areaswhere little old growth currently remains, for example, in the Oregon CoastRanges. Fragmentation of habitat can also adversely affect spotted owlsby: (1) Directly eliminating key roosting, nesting, or foraging stands;(2) indirectly reducing the survival of dispersing juvenile owls; (3) perhapsincreasing competition or predation, and (4) reducing population densitiesand interaction between individuals. These factors all interact to decreasehabitat quality, suitability, or effectiveness for supporting a well-distributedpopulation of spotted owls over time (Greene 1988, Harris 1984, Meslow<T3>et al</T3>. 1981, Spies and Franklin 1988, Thomas <T3>et al</T3>. 1988). The patchwork pattern of even-age, dispersed, clearcut timber harvest systemshas imposed a checkerboard pattern on present old-growth and mature forests,fragmenting remaining habitat throughout the owl's range and reducing thetotal amount of suitable spotted owl habitat. This fragmentation of spottedowl habitat may be especially noticeable on Bureau lands which are additionallycheckerboarded because of land ownership patterns. Forest Service modeling(USDA 1986) predicts that the mortality of dispersing juvenile owls willincrease whenever the amount of suitable habitat areas decreases. As spottedowl habitat continues to be reduced further by timber harvest, the currentspotted owl population is expected to decline correspondingly, and perhapsmore precipitously. It is unknown whether the amount and distribution ofspotted owl habitat remaining at the end of commercial harvest of old-growthforests on public lands (USDI 1989) will be adequate to support a viablepopulation of the northern spotted owl. Attempts to answer this questionby using the concepts and tools of population viability assessments havebeen undertaken by the Forest Service (USDA 1986, 1988) and Lande (1987a,1987b, 1988). Although subject to criticism on a number of grounds, theseassessments indicate that implementation of the Forest Service's preferredalternative for managing the spotted owl in Oregon and Washington (AlternativeF, USDA 1988) will not provide a high probability of persistence for thespotted owl over the next 50 to 100 years, at least not in significantportions of its range. Litigation has been initiated regarding the ForestService's preferred alternative. At this time it is not known whether thisalternative will be implemented. Moreover, at this writing, individualforest plans pertaining to spotted owl management based on the regionalguidelines have not been finalized. Although the actual numbers of owl sites and pairs on all lands is notprecisely known, recent surveys indicate that there are about 1,500 pairsof northern spotted owls within the present range of the subspecies, ofwhich over 90 percent are found on federally managed lands (USDI 1989).The present population is predicted to decline by about 50 percent (onForest Service lands) to 75 percent (BLM lands) from present levels overthe next 50 to 60 years under current management plans (USDA 1988).Data contributing to estimates of present population size have been collectedfor about 20 years, with counts of owls increasing over that period asgreater areas of habitat were surveyed (Gould 1985; Gould, pers. comm.;Forsman <T3>et al.</T3> 1987; USDA 1988; Robertson 1989; Vetterick 1989). However,the increase in numbers of spotted owls counted in these surveys reflectsan increase in inventory effort and improvements in inventory methods ratherthan an indication of any upward population trend. Not all forest habitathas been fully surveyed, as some areas, particularly wilderness areas,are difficult to inventory. However, Forest Service and Bureau biologistsbelieve that about 70 to 80 percent of the northern spotted owl populationhas been inventoried in most cases (Potter, pers. comm.; Logan, pers. comm.;D. Smithey, Bureau of Land Management, Coos Bay, OR, pers. comm.; D. Bonn,Bureau of Land Management, Medford, OR, pers. comm.; J. Lint, Bureau ofLand Management, Roseburg, OR, pers. comm.; Gould, pers. comm.; T. Simon-Jackson,USDA Forest Service, San Francisco, CA, pers. comm.; Forsman, pers. comm.).An estimate of population trends in relation to habitat over time is likelyto provide a better understanding of this or any habitat specific speciesthan just total numbers of individuals and pairs.Information about population trends for spotted owls is provided by threedifferent kinds of data: (1) Changes in spotted owl habitat; (2) changesin spotted owl population size; and (3) survival and reproductive rates.Both the close association between the spotted owl and old-growth forestsand the dramatic reductions in old growth that have occurred have beenthoroughly discussed earlier. This loss of old-growth and mature habitatcontinues, with projected losses on Federal lands of about 1.5 percentper year (USDA 1988) or greater (Morrison 1988). A number of biologistsknowledgeable about spotted owls have reported declines in owl populationsin many areas over the species' range in recent years, commensurate withdeclines in habitat (A. Franklin, Humboldt State Univ. Arcata, CA, pers.comm.; Meslow pers. comm.). Finally, when the best available estimatesof spotted owl survival and reproductive rates are combined and analyzed,resulting values point to a declining population (USDI 1989).Based on ecological theory, several predictions about the effects of continuedharvesting of preferred habitats on the future demographic performanceof spotted owls can be made. Given the data, it is likely that continuedharvest of preferred habitat will adversely affect spotted owl populations.As more of this habitat is removed and fragmented, the following is expectedto occur: (1) Individual owls will have to use habitats comprised of ahigher proportion of young forests, necessitating an increase in theirhome range size to meet their energetic and nutritional requirements andresulting in an overall decrease in density of spotted owls; and (2) asmore owls use less suitable habitats, there will likely be a decrease inthe average reproductive success of the population as a whole. Analysisof available information for spotted owls seems to support these theoreticalpredictions (USDI 1989).The reported variation in per capita reproductive rates between habitatsof different suitability implies that owls using young-growth forests mayactually contribute proportionately less to population recruitment thantheir numbers would suggest. Because of apparent differences in reproductiverates, it would be incorrect to assume that a given owl population, normallyconcentrated in old-growth forests, could be maintained for any lengthof time on a relatively larger area of less suitable, young forests. Thedata on spotted owls suggest that use of young forests by owls is dependenton the presence of old-growth stands within the home range.Fragmentation can also have harmful genetic consequences through its effecton the effective population size. Each subpopulation occupying a discretehabitat patch, such as those that result from habitat fragmentation, comprisesa component of the overall population, referred to as a ``metapopulation.''The processes of extinction and colonization within individual patchescan have deleterious genetic effects that might not be predicted by modelsthat do not consider metapopulation structure (USDI 1989).Although natural habitat is never constant, the original old-growth foresthabitat probably was fairly stable and continuous over much of the owl'shistorical range. Natural perturbations would generally tend to be smalland localized, creating occasional openings in an otherwise fairly continuousand closed-canopy forest environment. The current habitat situation forspotted owls continues to change from the original condition where unsuitablehabitat patches were small and isolated, to the reverse where suitablehabitat now occurs in small and isolated patches. These factors all interactto decrease habitat suitability or effectiveness for supporting a well-distributedpopulation of spotted owls over time (Greene 1988; Harris 1984; Meslow<T3>et al</T3>. 1981; Spies and Franklin 1988; Thomas <T3>et al</T3>. 1988).Spotted owl population viability assessments performed to date (USDA 1986,1988; Lande 1987a, 1987b, 1988) have not explicitly considered habitatdifferences in reproductive rates and how different fitnesses of owls indifferent habitats would affect population dynamics. In particular, thelife table and population viability analyses that have been performed todate may present an optimistic view of the future status of spotted owlpopulations for two reasons (USDI 1989). First, the population viabilityanalyses conducted by the Forest Service were based on a single frequencydistribution of reproduction rates, with a mean value from owl pairs inthe most preferred habitats. However, as discussed previously, theory andempirical data suggest that owl pairs in less suitable, younger habitatsmay have significantly lower per capita reproductive rates. Therefore,as more preferred habitat is cleared, population growth rates may be reducedto values lower than were used in existing models. Second, the Forest Service'spopulation viability analyses assume that a given Spotted Owl Habitat Area(SOHA) will be occupied with a probability proportional to the amount ofold-growth forest within the SOHA. However, the assumed relationship isbased on the present landscape configuration, the existing amounts of oldgrowth, and the current spatial relationships between old growth and younggrowth forests. The assumed SOHA occupancy probabilities are likely todecline as surrounding old growth is cleared and SOHAs become more isolatedfrom other large patches of preferred habitat. These points are intendedto emphasize the fact that the models should be interpreted cautiously,and that planning for the owl should include built-in safety factors toinsure that future habitat requirements for a viable population are notunderestimated.B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or EducationalPurposesConsiderable research by Federal, State, and private groups is being conductedon this subspecies. This work is providing valuable information and isnot having a negative impact on the subspecies. The spotted owl is nota game bird, nor is there any known commercial or sporting use.C. Disease or PredationPredation by great horned owls (<T3>Bubo virginianus</T3>) has been identified as a major source of juvenilemortality in spotted owls (USDI 1987; Dawson <T3>et al</T3>. 1986; USDA 1986; Simberloff 1987; and USDA 1988). Concernhas been expressed that increasing habitat fragmentation may be subjectingspotted owls to greater risks of predation as they move into or acrossmore open terrain, or come into more frequent contact with forest edgeswhere horned owls may be more numerous. Hamer (1989) has been studyingspotted owl and great horned owl interactions in the north Cascades ofWashington. His survey of the 145-square-mile Mt. Baker study area showedthat great horned owls were more common than spotted owls in this mostlyfragmented and young-growth dominated habitat. He found, with a limitedsample size, that spotted owls avoided areas intensively used by pairsof great horned owls. In young-growth forests in southwestern Washington,Irvin <T3>et al</T3>. (1989a) reported that great horned owls, along with thewestern screech owl (<T3>Otus asio</T3>), were the most commonly found owls, and that spottedowls were infrequently found. Specific impacts of great horned owl predationon the overall spotted owl population are unknown, but this remains anissue of concern. Parasites have been found in blood samples of the northernspotted owl, although their significance and potential impact on the subspeciesare unknown at the present time (Gould, pers. comm.).D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory MechanismsThere are numerous State and federal laws and regulations that, if enforced,may protect spotted owls and, to a lesser extent, spotted owl habitat.Implementation and effectiveness of these laws to date, however, has beenvariable.Each of the three States in which the subspecies occurs has recognizedthe precarious status of the owl. It is listed as endangered by the Stateof Washington, threatened by the State of Oregon, and as a sensitive speciesby the State of California. State laws in Washington and Oregon offer littleregulatory protection to the spotted owls other than a prohibition againsttaking. In California, timber management plans require the approval ofthe Department of Fish and Game.The Federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703 <T3>et seq</T3>.) prohibits taking of spotted owls or their eggs or nestsunless and except as permitted by regulation. The Act imposes criminalpenalties for unlawful taking.The National Park Service is required by statute to manage National parksto conserve their wildlife (16 U.S.C. 1). Approximately 8 to 10 percentof spotted owl habitat is located within National parks.The National Forest Management Act of 1976 and its implementing regulationsrequire the Forest Service to manage National Forests to provide enoughhabitat to maintain viable populations of native vertebrate species, suchas the spotted owl. These regulations define a viable population as onewhich ``has the estimated numbers and distribution of reproductive individualsto ensure its continued existence is well-distributed'' (36 CFR 219.19).The Forest Service manages about two-thirds of the current northern spottedowl habitat. Spotted owl management on National Forest lands in California,Oregon, and Washington is based on regional guidelines adopted by the PacificSouthwest Region (Region 5) for California and by the Pacific NorthwestRegion (Region 6) for Oregon and Washington. These guidelines provide fora network of forest-wide owl sites (Spotted Owl Habitat Areas or SOHAs)containing 1,000 acres in California and from 1,000 to 3,000 acres in Washingtonand Oregon. Some of these sites will be located in areas not availablefor timer harvest (e.g., natural areas, research areas, wilderness), butthe majority of the sites (60 to 70 percent) would be surrounded by commercialtimber land available for logging.The Forest Service has prepared a Final Supplement Environmental ImpactStatement (USDA 1988) with a preferred alternative to implement forestplans to manage about 300 spotted owl habitat areas within its lands inOregon and Washington. In California, the Forest Service is implementinga similar network system to manage about 250 owl habitat areas within itslands. The intent of this system in both Forest Service Regions is to maintainthe viability of the subspecies through a network system that is evenlydistributed over the range of the owl. Sites were to be selected basedupon known owl presence, although some sites were actually selected ontheir potential to contain owls rather than current occupancy. The potentialsuccess of this effort cannot be determined yet, since there have beeninsufficient time and data to determine trends.In late 1988, the Forest Service made its final Record of Decision on spottedowl management guidelines for National Forests in Washington and Oregon.The decision provides guidance (habitat amount, location, juxtaposition)to set aside a network of selected SOHAs, totaling approximately 374,000to 477,000 acres in Washington and Oregon forests. The Forest Service inCalifornia is preparing to finalize Forest plans implementing a similarhabitat management plan on the four National Forests in the northern spottedowl's range.The Forest Service's Record of Decision for Oregon and Washington set atimetable of 5 years for a full review of the Forest Service's owl managementprogram, continued implementation of a $5 million annual Research, Development,and Application Program, and reaffirmed the Forest Service's commitmentto coordinate and cooperate with other agencies. The Forest Service's spottedowl habitat guidelines are the subject of several current lawsuits. Whetheror not the current habitat guidance will stand is unknown. In addition,the final Forest Service spotted owl decision only addresses regional standardsand guidelines for spotted owl management. The actual implementation ofowl management will be based on individual forest plans once they are finalized.A thorough assessment of the impacts of the Forest Service's preferredalternative for each forest is not possible at this time since the actualarrangements (location and juxtaposition) of occupied management areas(SOHAs) have not been tested or available for interagency or public review.The Bureau of Land Management administers approximately 11 percent of spottedowl habitat, mostly in Oregon. Most Bureau forest lands in Oregon are administeredunder the provision of the Oregon and California Act, which mandates managementof these lands for permanent forest production. These lands cannot be withdrawnor set aside for other long-term management objectives unless other applicablestatutes permit. However, short-term (10-year) restrictions can be placedon certain tracts during a 10-year planning period (W. Nietro, Bureau ofLand Management, Portland, OR, pers. comm. 1989). Currently, there aretimber harvesting restrictions on 110 Spotted Owl Management Areas (SOMAs)that are managed by the Bureau under a cooperative agreement with the OregonDepartment of Fish and Wildlife through 1990. The intent is to providelinkages and habitat for 90 pairs of owls between Forest Service landsin the Oregon Cascades and Coast Ranges and to preserve the integrity ofthese sites into the next planning period. These pairs constitute approximatelyone-third of the known spotted owl pairs on Bureau lands in Oregon. TheBureau only manages small parcels of owl habitat in California and nonein Washington.The success (viability) of spotted owl pairs, in terms of survival andreproductive output, is predicted largely on the sufficiency of their habitatto support the full range of physical, behavioral, and nutritional needsof the subspecies as expressed by measurement of owl use. Selected SOHAor SOMA size in the Forest Service's FSEIS and the Bureau of Land Management/OregonDepartment of Fish and Wildlife agreement is generally less than the meanamount of preferred habitat documented within the home ranges of pairedowls studied in all physiographic provinces (USDI 1989). As a consequence,some pairs may not persist in less than optimally sized habitats (Ruggiero<T3>et al</T3>. 1988).According to the final regional guidance, and the Record of Decision (forOregon and Washington), the Forest Service does not quantitatively providefor long-term contingencies in the case of catastrophic environmental events.Similarly, current spotted owl habitat management by the Bureau does nottake into consideration or provide for such events.In August 1988, an Interagency Agreement established in 1987 between theFish and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service was expanded to includethe Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service. This agreementrequires the four agencies to cooperate, coordinate, exchange data, andreview proposals designed to manage and protect owl habitat; it also commitsthem to manage land to maintain viable, well-distribute spotted owl populations.However, at this time, there are no coordinated management schemes in placeamong the agencies; the Forest Service and Bureau have developed timberharvest proposals and spotted owl protection strategies independently ofeach other.The cumulative impact of timber-cutting practices by land managing agenciesincreases and exacerbates the fragmentation of existing owl habitat. Theproposed spotted owl management plans of the Forest Service and Bureauof Land Management are untested. Recent legal actions aside, there is noindication from the land management agencies that the current rate of changefrom old growth to young, even-aged forest management will diminish. Further,as agencies concentrate their clearcutting activities outside of designatedspotted owl habitat management areas, future habitat management optionswill be lost if currently planned habitat networks prove later to be deficient.E. Other Natural or Man-Made Factors Affecting Its Continued ExistenceThe barred owl (<T3>Strix varia</T3>), has undergone rapid range expansion over the past20 years into the range of the spotted owl in the northwestern United States(Hamer 1988; USDI 1989). Gould (pers. comm.) indicates that the barredowl now occurs as far south as Mendocino County, California. Furthermore,it has at least replaced, and possibly displaced, the northern spottedowl in some areas (Forsman and Meslow 1986; Allen <T3>et al</T3>. 1985; Hamer and Samson 1987). Hamer (1988, 1989) notedthat the barred owl seems to be more prevalent in cut-over areas than spottedowls. On his study area in the northern Cascade Mountains of Washington,the barred owl is now 2.1 times more numerous than the spotted owl.The barred owl's adaptability and aggressive nature appear to allow itto take advantage of habitat perturbations, such as those that result fromhabitat fragmentation, and to expand its range where it may compete withthe spotted owl for available resources. The long-term impact to the spottedowl is unknown, but of considerable concern. Continued examination is warrantedof the role and impact of the barred owl as a congeneric intruder in historicalspotted owl range and its relationship to habitat fragmentation. The potentialfor interbreeding of the two species also merits concern and monitoring.There are numerous examples of extrinsic factors such as fires, wind damage,and volcanic action affecting forest habitat, including known spotted owlhabitat. These natural occurrences have not been factored into any futureprojections of population persistence of the spotted owl, and their impactis unknown. Genetic problems (such as inbreeding) have not yet been considereda problem with spotted owls.In its Status Review and Supplement (USDI 1987, 1989), the Service hascompiled and carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by thisspecies in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation,the Service has found that listing the northern spotted owl as a threatenedspecies throughout its range is warranted. The Endangered Species Act of1973 (Act), as amended, states that the term ``endangered species'' meansany species which is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significantportion of its range. The term ``threatened species'' means any specieswhich is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeablefuture throughout all or a significant portion of its range. Given theloss of a substantial amount (70 to 80 percent) of historical habitat fromtimber harvesting, and continuing and planned reduction and fragmentationof a large portion of the remaining old-growth and mature habitat, thenorthern spotted owl population will continue to decline unless steps aretaken to offset these losses.The northern spotted owl shows a clear preference throughout its rangefor old-growth forests and forests with old-growth characteristics fornesting, foraging, and roosting. Forests are considered ``old growth''when about 200 or more years of age, although some old-growth characteristicspreferred by spotted owls may appear prior to that age in mature timber(from about 100 to 200 years of age). As a result of historical and ongoingtimber harvest, the once extensive and continuous old-growth forests arebeing converted to a patchwork landscape dominated by young, even-agedstands. Existing timber management planning and policies do not providefor old growth replacement because of rotation periods ranging from about70 to 120 years on federal lands to as little as 40 years on private lands.If current management practices continue, by the year 2050, most commercialold-growth forests will have been logged and converted to younger, even-agedmanaged forests. This would represent a total decline of at least 80 to85 percent from the amount of preferred habitat originally estimated forthe western part of the Pacific Northwest, including northern California.Impacts from timber harvesting are rangewide and, in addition to causingthe direct loss of preferred habitat, appear to be affecting the qualityof the remaining forest habitat throughout much of the species' range.Moreover, the total population of spotted owls is relatively low (recentsurveys report about 1,500 pairs) and pairs are relatively widely spaced.This subspecies has very specific and narrow habitat requirements. Witha low, variable reproductive rate and a low population density, a consequencepartly of its large home range requirements, the spotted owl would be especiallyvulnerable to localized catastrophic events. Lastly, current and proposedmanagement practices may not be designed for nor be sufficient to ensurelong-term population viability of the spotted owl. On the basis of thebest scientific and commercial data available, the Service believes thatthreatened status is warranted rangewide for the entire population of thenorthern spotted owl.Under the Act's definition, to be considered for endangered classification,the spotted owl would have to be in danger of extinction throughout allor a significant portion of its range. While the available data indicatea gradual, rangewide decline in the species commensurate with habitat loss,they do not suggest that extinction is an imminent possibility. The Servicerecognizes that the situation is most serious in the California Coast Range(especially Marin and Sonoma Counties), the Oregon Coast Ranges (beginningwith Coos Bay Bureau of Land Management lands north to the Columbia River),and from the Olympic Peninsula south to the Columbia River. However, whenthe status of the entire subspecies is analyzed rangewide, it is the Service'sconclusion that the likelihood of extinction of the subpopulations of theowls in these areas is not so immediate as to justify a rangewide endangeredclassification at this time. The Olympic Peninsula population of the northernsubspecies may be the only unit that could qualify as a distinct populationunder the Act. However, it was not clear that identifying this as a separatepopulation was fully justified by the data or that the immediacy of threatin relationship to other areas was sufficient to warrant a separate designationas endangered at this time.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat</ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Endangered Species Act (Act), as amended, requiresthat, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary proposecritical habitat at the time the species is proposed to be listed as endangeredor threatened.The Service finds that critical habitat for the northern spotted owl isnot presently determinable. The Service's regulations (50 CFR 424.12(a)(2))state that critical habitat is not determinable if information sufficientto perform required analyses of the impacts of the designation is lackingor if the biological needs of the species are not sufficiently well knownto permit identification of an area of critical habitat. By critical habitatis meant ``specific areas within the geographical area currently occupiedby a species on which are found the physical or biological features essentialto the conservation of the species and that may require special managementconsiderations or protection'' (50 CFR 424.02(d)).The extensive range of the northern spotted owl, from British Columbiato San Francisco Bay, involves over 7 million acres of its preferred old-growthand mature forest habitat and an undetermined amount of other forest typesthat may also be of significance to the survival and recovery of the subspecies.Much of this habitat has been fragmented by logging, and many stands areisolated from each other or of such small size as not to support viablepopulations of spotted owls. The specific size, spatial configuration andjuxtaposition of these essential habitats as well as vital connecting linkagesbetween areas necessary for ensuring the conservation of the subspeciesthroughout its range have not been determined at this time, nor have analysesbeen conducted on the impacts of a designation.During the proposed comment period, the Service will seek additional agencyand public input on critical habitat, along with information on the biologicalstatus of and threats to the spotted owl. The Service intends to use thisand other information in formulating a decision on critical habitat designationfor the spotted owl.<ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures</ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The EndangeredSpecies Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation withthe States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listedspecies. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitionsagainst taking and harm are discussed, in part, below.Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if anyis being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperationprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(4) ofthe Act requires Federal agencies to confer with the Service on any actionthat is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed speciesor result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat.Regulations governing these conferences are found at 50 CFR 402.10. Ifa species is listed subsequently, Section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agenciesto ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likelyto jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy oradversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect alisted species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agencymust enter into formal consultation with the Service.The U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management have active timbersale programs in the Pacific Northwest, including northern California,whereby private timber companies bid for the right to log Federal land.In Fiscal Year 1989, the Forest Service had 425 timber sales containingabout 48,000 acres that included at least some northern spotted owl habitat.To date, the Forest Service has been enjoined through court action fromcompleting 165 timber sales, totalling approximately 22,500 acres, largelybecause of spotted owls and old growth issues. About 52 timber sales, representingroughly 2,600 acres, have been released by the Court and subsequently offeredfor sale (G. Gunderson, USDA Forest Service, Portland, OR, pers. comm.).It is anticipated that future proposed sale activity will be similar, butwill depend in part, upon the outcome of a number of unresolved court challenges.In 1988, the Bureau of Land Management advertised 229 timber sales fora total of 29,798 acres. Of these planned sales, 41 (5,330 acres) are involvedin an existing lawsuit. During 1989, the Bureau plans to advertise 190timber sales to harvest 24,655 acres; there is also an existing lawsuitinvolving 75 of these sales, covering 9,750 acres, (Nietro, pers. comm.).On an annual basis, the Bureau awards contracts to harvest 32,940 acres,of which 22,800 acres are clearcut and 10,140 acres are partially cut.Of the acreage cut, approximately 66 percent of the harvest is in forestsover 200 years old (Nietro, pers. comm.). Because habitat loss and modification resulting from timber harvestingactivities represents the primary threat to the northern spotted owl, theForest Service and Bureau will review and assess the potential impactsof timber sales on this species to ensure compliance with Section 7 ofthe Act, as described above. The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 and 17.31 setforth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that generally applyto threatened wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal forany person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to take (includesharass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect;or to attempt any of these), import or export, ship in interstate commercein the course of commercial activity, or sell or offer for sale in interstateor foreign commerce any listed species. It also is illegal to possess,sell, deliver, carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife that has beentaken illegally. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service andState conservation agencies. Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involvingthreatened wildlife species under certain circumstances. Regulations governingpermits are at 50 CFR 17.22, 17.23, and 17.32. Such permits are availablefor scientific purposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of thespecies, and/or for incidental take in connection with otherwise lawfulactivities. For threatened species, there are also permits for zoologicalexhibition, educational purposes, or special purposes consistent with thepurposes of the Act. On June 28, 1979, the order Strigiformes, which includes all owls, wasincluded in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in EndangeredSpecies of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The effect to this listing isthat export permits are generally required before international shipmentmay occur. Such shipment is strictly regulated by CITES party nations toprevent effects that may be detrimental to the species' survival. <ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments Solicited </ITAG>The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposalwill be as accurate and as effective as possible. Therefore, comments orsuggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies, thescientific community, industry, or any other interested party concerningthis proposed rule are hereby solicited.
