<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-14-0457 </DOCNO><TEXT>Several samples of zirconia doped with various proportions of yttria andferric oxide have been prepared and well sintered at chosen conditions.On these prepared samples numerous measurements have been undertakencomprising Cu-K/sub {alpha}/ X-ray diffraction patterns, infrared absorptionspectra, true and bulk densities. Results obtained are discussed in detailon the basis of the interaction of single and double dopants with zirconiaand/or stabilized zirconia lattices.</TEXT></DOC>
