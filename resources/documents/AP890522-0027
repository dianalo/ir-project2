It's the real war,'' William Olson,deputy assistant secretary for defense for low-intensity conflict,said in a recent interview. ``But it's very difficult to go to theAmerican public and convince them that a country that has apopulation less than Cook County, Illinois, is a threat to nationalsecurity.''   Olson and others say Pentagon strategy for the past 40 years hasfocused on possible confrontation with the Soviet Union, leading inturn to an emphasis on massive troop deployments and expensive,hi-tech weapons. They say the Defense Department's failure toconcentrate more on guerrilla wars left the United Statesill-prepared to deal with such low-intensity conflicts, which Olsonsays can pose ``a threat to our economic interests, a threat topolitical values, a threat to the survival of our friends andallies.''   Congress, noting the importance of the issue, in 1986 mandated aspecial office to coordinate low-intensity conflict and specialoperations. It called for a new command, an added assistantsecretary of defense and a special board within the NationalSecurity Council.   Since then, legislators have given high marks to the militaryfor moving ahead with the special operations command, which unitesthe elite units of the Army, Air Force and Navy at MacDill AirForce Base in Florida. But they point to foot-dragging surroundinglow-intensity conflict policy.   ``Three problems are most glaring: the lack of interest inlow-intensity conflict which is most pronounced in non-defenseactivities, major conceptual shortcomings, and the lack ofinteragency coordination,'' four of the Senate proponents of thelegislation said in a Jan. 25 letter to Lt. Gen. Brent Scowcroft,President Bush's national security director.   ``Unfortunately, opposition within the Executive Branch hasblocked meaningful implementation of these important reforms,'' theletter signed by Sens. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., John Warner, R-Va., EdwardKennedy, D-Mass., and William Cohen, R-Maine, said.   Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, of the House Committee on ArmedServices, said ``institutional opposition'' at the Pentagon delayedthe appointment of an assistant secretary of defense. FormerAmbassador Charles S. Whitehouse assumed the office in June 1988but already is stepping down due to the change in administrations.   Military and legislative sources said the leading candidate isJames R. Locher, an aide to Nunn, and that Defense Secretary DickCheney has sent Locher's name to President Bush for approval.   ``He's the only man for the job,'' retired Army Col. GeorgeTalbot said of Locher. ``Of all the possible men who could make thecut, Locher is the one.''   Talbot was Olson's predecessor as Pentagon policy specialist forlow-intensity conflict from May 1987 to October 1987. He said hequit because the Pentagon ``didn't want an activist guy'' and fewpolicy makers understand what guerrilla wars involve.   ``In a very short time we get fed up,'' he said in a telephoneinterview. ``It's not what the professional warrior class wants todo. That's why we're no good at it.''   Army Col. Ed Smith, in a position paper about low-intensityconflict last year, said it is ``total war'' and described it as``an armed conflict in a Third World country that affects nationalsecurity interests _ a conflict which has the potential to involveU.S. armed combat forces.''   Smith preferred the term ``high-probability conflict'' anddefined it as ``our Marxist-Leninist foes exploiting a U.S.vulnerability _ the seams between the Department of State,Department of Defense, and Congress created by regulatory missionsand statutes.''   Guerrilla wars, such as those being fought today in El Salvadorand Peru, generally involve low levels of combat with weaponry nomore sophisticated than rifles or mortars. By definition, so-calledconventional wars use advanced fighter jets, tanks and missiles.   Part of the U.S. armed forces program for low-intensity conflicthas been to train, equip and support foreign military forces. Inthe case of El Salvador, 55 American advisers train the Salvadoranmilitary to combat a leftist guerrilla insurgency.   ``The whole thrust of our low-intensity conflict policy is toavoid the commitment of U.S. forces,'' Olson said. ``There is noconsensus in U.S. involvement in these small wars.''   He said the military traditionally has cited tensions with theSoviet Union to justify huge military outlays and sophisticatedweaponry. Soldiers, in turn, he added,received encouragement topursue careers in the infantry, cavalry or artillery rather thanthe elite special operations forces.   Kasich, however, said low-intensity conflict is the ``bigchallenge'' and added: ``It doesn't matter if everybody understandsit. What matters is that you have people in the Senate and Congresswho support it.''</TEXT></DOC>
