HilderStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/24/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FIN GOVMTTENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) </IN><TEXT>   Financial Corp. of America said it isn't discussing a possible acquisition of the thrift holding company with anyone but is willing to talk to prospective buyers.    &quot;We have had no discussion with anybody about buying our company,&quot; William J. Popejoy, chairman of Financial Corp., said in an interview. &quot;I have for years now said that if we have an opportunity to build our capital on a faster basis than just through retained earnings, we would welcome that with open arms.&quot;    Mr. Popejoy's statement responded to reports by thrift-industry sources that Edwin J. Gray, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, has been seeking a buyer for Financial Corp. and its American Savings andamp; Loan Association unit, which is the nation's largest thrift.    A Financial Corp. spokeswoman declined to comment directly on reports of Mr. Gray's activities; she said it is more appropriate for the Bank Board to comment. The Bank Board has declined to comment on the reports.    However, Financial Corp. said it received a letter from Mr. Gray dated Jan. 26, 1987, indicating that the Bank Board will continue to assist Financial Corp.'s efforts &quot;to maintain profitable operations.&quot;    The letter is nearly identical to one Mr. Gray wrote in March 1986, which allowed Financial Corp.'s outside auditing firm, Peat, Marwick, Mitchell andamp; Co. to remove its qualified opinion of Financial Corp.'s 1984 financial statements.    The Financial Corp. spokeswoman declined to release Peat Marwick's opinion letter on the company's 1986 financial statement. She said, however, that a current draft of the letter doesn't refer to the letter from Mr. Gray. The 1986 Peat Marwick letter did refer to Mr. Gray's 1986 letter.    The two letters will be included in Financial Corp.'s annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which will be filed near the end of the month, the spokeswoman said.    Financial Corp. common stock fell 75 cents yesterday, to close at $9 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading of 903,000 shares.    Despite Mr. Gray's efforts, thrift industry executives and analysts have said that any quick sale of Financial Corp. or American Savings seems unlikely.    Financial Corp. has said in Securities and Exchange Commission filings that it needs about $1.2 billion in additional capital to increase the capital of American Savings to 4% of its liabilities, the level required by the Bank Board.    Mr. Gray repeated in his Jan. 26 letter that the Bank Board won't take action against Financial Corp. because of the capital deficiency. But if Financial Corp. or American Savings is acquired, additional capital would almost certainly have to be provided by the buyer or the Federal Savings andamp; Loan Insurance Corp., or both.    Mr. Gray, meanwhile, has said that the FSLIC will have only about $2 billion of cash and securities on hand by early next month to insure about $900 billion of deposits in savings and loan associations. The Government Accounting Office has said the FSLIC was insolvent at the end of 1986, based on generally accepted accounting principles.    Although other thrifts have criticized Financial Corp.'s strategy of keeping more than 90% of its assets in fixed-rate mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, at least one formerly critical analyst currently is recommending the stock.    Jonathan E. Gray, a thrift analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co., said he believes Financial Corp. is in a much better financial position than it was six months or a year ago. He noted that it has about $780 million of reserves against possible loan losses. The company's troubled assets are about $2.5 billion out of total assets of about $34 billion. He also noted that Financial Corp. has about $11 billion of interest-rate swaps that reduce its vulnerability to a rise in interest rates. Such swaps allow a borrower to exchange with another borrower or with an investment-banking firm debt carrying fixed-rate interest payments for debt carrying a floating rate.    However, the analyst said Financial Corp. stock remains &quot;an aggressive speculation&quot; and that over the next two to three years the company must move more of its assets into adjustable-rate mortgages. </TEXT></DOC>
