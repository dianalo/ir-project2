 His first book, Inside the IBM PC, becamethe dog-eared manifesto of every corporate hacker this side of IBM.andP;  And TheNorton Utilities, released in 1983, opened the inner chambers of MS-DOS toeveryone with a copy of the book and a few hundred hours to kill.andM;Times have changed, and so have The Norton Utilities.andP;  Version 5.0 is proofthat technical excellence and ease of use can improve year after year with noapparent end.andP;  This latest version is more accessible, more powerful, andmore comprehensive than its predecessor (version 4.5) and all of itscompetitors.andM;Take the new File Fix program, one of about 20 utility programs included inthis new version.andP;  Almost everyone has had a disk file ruined or transformedinto garbage.andP;  The CHKDSK command in DOS restores the file to human-readableform and even copies it into a new, DOS-created file.andP;  But trash remainstrash, and it's nearly impossible to use a &quot;restored&quot; file for anything butan excuse to go home early.andP;  File Fix, on the other hand, completely restoresboth the files and their data--even 1-2-3 worksheets can be restored toreadable files.andM;Another new program is Cache, a straightforward disk-caching program.andP;  Thevery useful Diskreet program lets you protect your files by creating a phonyhard-disk drive that can be opened and closed only with a password.andP;  Thosewho don't have a password cannot access either the drive or the data itcontains, even if they use The Norton Utilities' low-level snooping tools.andM;Calibrate is a testing program that can adjust disk interleaving and therebyimprove access time and performance.andP;  A low-level reformatting programspruces up a disk surface to increase data retention and prevent futureproblems.andP;  This procedure leaves existing data unharmed, so you don't have toback up and restore your hard disk, as you do when you use the reformattingtechnique offered by most hard-disk vendors.andM;Those who worry about disk and file integrity will welcome the new File Saveand Disk Monitor programs.andP;  File Save lets users specify how DOS should useerased file space.andP;  Normally, when you erase a file in DOS, it is notimmediately removed from the disk.andP;  Rather, DOS marks the file's sectors asavailable for future use.andP;  File Save delays physical erasure of importantfiles by referring to a user-defined priority list of the types of erasedfile space that DOS can use.andP;  Thus, you can erase files from the directorybut keep them on the disk for as long as possible.andP;  DOS doesn't use theirspace until it has to.andP;  When you &quot;undelete&quot; an important file using Unerase,there's probably a good chance that it will be restored in its entirety.andO;Incidentally, Unerase now searches for deleted files by file type (1-2-3,dBase, and text), by a text string, or by the former default method of erasedfile names.andM;Disk Monitor, a RAM-resident program, allows users to protect disks, files,and system areas from unauthorized disk writes.andP;  It informs users, via apop-up window, of an application's attempt to write to disk and requestsexplicit approval to complete the disk drive.andP;  This can be useful for thoseconcerned about computer viruses, which typically write to system areas or toCOMMAND.COM files.andP;  Another Disk Monitor option enables a &quot;disk light,&quot; whichappears on the screen whenever a disk is being accessed.andP;  This is aparticularly good option for those who use remote network drives.andM;In addition to these new programs, all the programs included in previousversions of The Norton Utilities have been updated and expanded.andP;  All have amore accessible user interface.andP;  Those who use EGA or VGA displays and amouse will probably agree that The Norton Utilities has one of the mostresponsive graphical user interfaces available in a non-Windows application.andO;Those who do not use a mouse will be impressed with the range of optionsadded to the programs via pull-down menus, dialog boxes, and radio buttons.andO;And in most cases, reports produced by individual utilities can now be viewedon the screen, as well as printed or saved to disk.andM;The upgraded File Find program now searches for files by directory criteriasuch as date, time, size, and file attribute.andP;  Incorporated into File Find isthe former Text Search program, which lets you find files that meet bothexternal attribute criteria and internal data criteria.andP;  Also incorporatedinto File Find is the old Attribute program, which automatically assigns theread-only (or any other) attribute to files as they are found.andM;Safe Format, a fickle program at best in version 4.5, has been updated to dowhat it is supposed to do: format disks according to users' preferences, notits own.andP;  The previous version had particular problems with external laptopdrives and with disks that contained system files.andP;  No more.andP;  Safe Format nowdoes precisely what it is told to do.andP;  It still tells you what it thinks youshould do with a particular disk, but it's much easier to override theprogram's choices.andM;The System Information program, once the paragon of benchmark testing, nowdoes more thoroughly what its name implies.andP;  Not only have the speed testsbeen vastly improved and made more consistent with real-world operations, butthe program also provides more-precise information about a computer'sinternal status.andP;  Everything from memory status to hardware interrupts to I/Oports to RAM-resident programs and device drivers are catalogued by this newupdate.andP;  In all, System Information provides about 20 screens of detailedanalysis.andM;There is, of course, much more to The Norton Utilities version 5.0 than canbe summarized here.andP;  But suffice it to say that this new version, though onlya half integer upgrade from version 4.5, deserves a 10.0 for usability,power, and practicality.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
