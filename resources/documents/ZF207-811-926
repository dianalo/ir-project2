 In one fell swoop, the rules of thegame, the strategies of the players, and even the composition of the teamschanged.andP;  Users and vendors around the world now must figure out what theyshould do.andM;Briefly, here is what happened.andM;Microsoft and AppleandM;Microsoft has signed an agreement with Apple Computer under which Microsoftwill incorporate Apple's Royal outline font technology as the default outlinefont technology for screen display in OS/2 Presentation Manager (PM).andP;  PMwill generate screen bitmap characters on the fly from the same Royal-formatcharacter outlines that Apple will use in its Macintosh System 7 (see Vol.andO;18, No.andP;  16).andM;The Royal technology will also be included in Microsoft Windows for MS-DOS.andO;However, because of memory limitations in MS-DOS machines, it is possiblethat users will have the system pre-compute screen bitmaps for the typefont/size combinations they intend to use, rather than have them computed onthe fly as they type or edit text.andM;This means that PCs running Windows or PM, Macintoshes running Version 7 orlater of the Mac System software, all slave printers (including dot-matrixprinters and &quot;dumb&quot; ink-jet and laser printers) driven directly from the hostPC or Mac, and all intelligent output devices that include Apple or Microsofttechnology will use the same font technology and the same font library.andM;This font technology will be a standard part of all of these machines.andP;  Allusers will have to do is buy the fonts they want and load them into theircomputers and printers.andM;* Microsoft and Apple will create an &quot;open&quot; font standard.andP;  The font formatwill be published so that anyone who chooses to can make and market fontsthat will run in all of these machines.andP;  The rendering technology will belicensed to anyone who wants to use it, including printer manufacturers,typesetter manufacturers and other computer systems companies.andM;* Although Royal will be the standard font technology shipped with every copyof OS/2, Microsoft will provide a mechanism to support other fonttechnologies as well.andP;  The vendor of an output device that uses some otherfont technology can embed that technology in the printer device driver forhis device.andP;  Windows or PM will ask the device driver to prepare the requiredcharacter bitmaps, which are then passed to the application program fordisplay on the screen.andM;Microsoft announced the first such arrangement at the Conference: it hasagreed to support the Compugraphic Intellifont format (which Hewlett-Packardwill use in its upcoming PCL Level 5 LaserJet printers) in the PCL devicedrivers.andP;  Clearly, the same sort of mechanism could be used to support Adobeformat fonts too.andM;Apple has made no such accommodation.andP;  Adobe was able to make its ATM fonttechnology work with the current Apple System 6 without help from Apple.andO;Apple warns that it is going to be much more difficult (and much moredangerous) for Adobe to pull off the same feat with the upcoming System 7.andO;Apple says that it has no intention of giving Adobe any help in this effort.andO;It does not want some other company messing around with attaching things toApple system software.andM;* In exchange for the font technology, Microsoft wil license to Apple thePostScript clone technology it obtained when it acquired Bauer Technologyearlier this spring.andP;  (See The Seybold Report on Desktop Publishing, Vol.andP;  3,No.andP;  12.)andM;* In fact, Microsoft now intends to move aggressively into the output imagingtechnology business.andP;  Apple and Microsoft will work to make the MicrosoftPostScript with Apple Royal font technology the dominant form of PostScript.andO;With input and suggestions from Apple, Microsoft intends to extend andenhance its PostScript implementation.andM;By implication, this could well lead to two principal PostScript developmentcenters--Adobe and Microsoft--each promoting a somewhat different form ofPostScript.andP;  Microsoft is not particularly worried about the two versionsdiverging too greatly.andP;  It says that this is exactly what has happened in thecomputer programming language business, with the result that the two majorcompetitors each feel compelled to match features introduced by the other.andM;* The relationship between Apple and Microsoft has changed dramatically.andO;Apple and Microsoft will work closely together on fonts and on the outputlanguages.andP;  But this is just the beginning.andP;  We believe that the agreementpresages a closer working relationship between the two competitors in otherareas as well--which should result in greater compatibility between Macs andPCs and in reduced barriers to mixed Mac/PC environments.andM;* Now that they have their own PostScript, both Microsoft and Apple will beplacing more emphasis on PostScript.andM;Previously, both companies had been moving towards extending their screenimaging languages (GPI for Microsoft Presentation Manager, QuickDraw forApple) as output printer languages as well.andP;  This would have insured tightercompatibility between the screen display and hard-copy output, but it wouldhave created a situation in which Macintoshes could not access GPI printersand PCs could not drive QuickDraw printers.andM;Both companies still talk about QuickDraw and GPI printers, but now they aretalking primarily about dumb devices that are driven directly by the samesoftware that drives the screen display.andP;  When they talk about intelligentprinters that contain their own built-in controllers, both companies nowplace more emphasis on Microsoft PostScript, which will use the same fonttechnology used on PCs and Macs and which can be driven by both PCs and Macs.andM;* This is still leaves the unpleasant fact that even though they may sharethe same font technology and the same font library, we are talking about fourdifferent imaging languages: GDI (Microsoft Windows), GPI (Microsoft OS/2Presentation Manager), Apple QuickDraw and PostScript.andM;These differences must impose some barrier to transparent exchange of graphicinformation.andM;Both Microsoft and Apple say that common font technology is the crucial part.andO;Graphics, they claim, are easier to translate.andP;  Even so, Microsoft didannounce that it intends to make GPI and Microsoft PostScript more similarover time.andM;Since Microsoft and Apple dominate the desktop market, they believe that itis almost a foregone conclusion that their common font format will become thedominant industry standard.andP;  Other vendors, they believe, will ultimatelyhave to support the Royal font format because they cannot afford to beincompatible with all those millions of PCs and Macs or with all theMicrosoft PostScript printers that the two companies expect to see.andM;In fact, they expect that the open Royal font format will rapidly attract allof the clone vendors who have had a hard time cracking the PostScript marketbecause they could not legally use Adobe Type One fonts in their printers.andM;Adobe's responseandM;The Microsoft/Apple alliance is clearly a serious threat to Adobe Systems.andO;Adobe simply had to respond.andP;  Adobe's John Warnock did, indeed, respond withan emotional and heartfelt speech.andP;  The industry, he said, had come too faron the basis of a single PostScript standard.andP;  Adobe, he declared, is notgoing to see that destroyed.andM;In particular, Warnock (and, later in the day, Chuck Geschke) announced:andM;* Adobe will publish the entire PostScript language specification, includingthe format for Type One fonts.andP;  This means that the Adobe font format, too,will be &quot;open.&quot;andP;  As with the Apple/Microsoft Royal font format, anyone whochooses to will be able to make and sell Adobe Type One fonts.andM;Even more important, any PostScript clone vendor will now be able to build inits own software that can accept Adobe fonts and output them.andP;  Many of theclone vendors have already &quot;reverse engineered&quot; the ability to use Adobefonts, but few have dared to offer this to customers for fear of legalretribution from Adobe.andP;  Now they need not worry.andM;Although it will take a while for Adobe to prepare all of the documentationfor dissemination, the big club wielded by Microsoft and Apple has convincedAdobe to give the PostScript clone vendors what they have wanted for so long.andO;Bill Gates said that now that Adobe has agreed to make its font formatpublic, even Microsoft may build support for both Royal and Adobe formatfonts into the Microsoft PostScript.andM;Adobe will continue to collect royalties on fonts that are converted to Adobeformat using tools licensed from Adobe.andP;  It will not try to collect royaltieson fonts converted using other software.andM;* Adobe is proceeding with its new ATM (Adobe Type Manager) font technologyfor both Macintoshes and PCs.andP;  ATM software compatible with the current AppleSystem 6 software will ship to end users in October.andP;  The software will runin a standard 1-MB Mac.andP;  (System 7 will require a 2-MB machine.)andP;  Advancedemand from users and dealers has been very high.andM;Warnock promised that Adobe will provide ATM for Presentation Manager andWindows.andP;  He also promised that Adobe will do whatever is necessary to makeATM work with Apple System 7, even if Apple does its best to prevent Adobefrom accomplishing this.andM;Adobe thus hopes to hold its market position by providing software that willlet both Macs and PCs use all of their current Adobe-format outline fonts forscreen display and for output.andM;* Adobe will move aggressively to extend PostScript.andP;  Some of this will comein the form of documenting and generalizing what have previously beenspecialized extensions.andP;  Some will include completely new capabilities.andM;Extensions mentioned include standard support for Japanese (two-byte)character coding, Display PostScript enhancements, support for internationalstandard color models, data compression for images, and standard provisionsfor handling device options.andM;Clearly, Adobe intends to move rapidly to keep the initiative and forceMicrosoft into a &quot;catch up&quot; position.andM;* Adobe will hold a developers conference this coming spring.andP;  This will givesoftware developers information on what to expect, and it will provide aforum through which they can provide feed-back to Adobe.andM;How did this happen?andM;The announcements and counter-announcements were the culmination of a springand summer of intense behind-the-scenes activity.andP;  Shortly after the SeyboldSeminars in March, Microsoft had decided that it desperately needed toinclude outline font technology in its graphic environments and had set theobjective for itself of being able to announce its decision at the ComputerPublishing Conference in September.andP;  (See &quot;Font technology takes centerstage&quot; in the May issue of the Seybold Report on Desktop Publishing.)andP;  Italso decided that, unlike Apple, it would not attempt to invent its own fonttechnology, but would make a choice from the alternatives already available.andM;Everyone in the business knew that the decision would be momentous.andP;  Adobehad had its own outline font format from the beginning.andP;  Apple was developingits own font format (announced to the world in May).andP;  Sun had chosen theFolio F3 format.andP;  hewlett-Packard had allied itself with Compugraphic.andP;  Thisleft Bitstream and The Company (Nimbus Q) as the principal non-alignedcandidates.andM;Because of the dominance of the PC in the desktop market, whatever Microsoftchose would clearly become a standard.andP;  Whatever choice it made would clearlyrestructure the industry in some fashion.andP;  In the end, out of all thepossible alternatives, Microsoft chose the one that will have the mostimpact.andM;Why not Adobe?andP;  As we stated in our article in May, users would clearlyprefer a single, open font technology standard.andP;  In fact, to be perfectlyhonest, users would really prefer a single, open imaging model standard aswell.andM;There was, therefore, considerable unhappiness among Conference attendeesthat Microsoft did not pick the Adobe ATM format.andP;  With so much momentumbehind PostScript and so much investment in PostScript fonts, why introduce asecond (or third) standard?andM;We think that there is a possibility that had Adobe taken the actions it tookat this year's Conference a year earlier--or even six months earlier--theremight have been so much momentum behind the Adobe format that it would havebeen the natural choice.andM;But even this is not certain.andP;  What is certain is that in the crucial periodthis spring and summer, the conflicting business and technical interests,commercial realties and personalities could not be reconciled.andP;  WhatMicrosoft wanted, Adobe could not give.andP;  What Adobe wanted, Microsoft couldnot accept.andM;Three (or more) standards.andP;  It looked for some time, therefore, as if wewould end up with multiple font formats.andP;  Adobe had its format.andP;  Apple hadits format.andP;  Microsoft would select a third.andP;  HP and Sun had their formats,which might or might not turn out to be different from what Microsoft chose.andM;The Microsoft font technology clearly would have become a standard.andP;  Itwould, after all, have been the default standard for every Windows andpresentation Manager PC.andP;  And Microsoft, which by this time had decided thatit wanted to be in the output imaging technology business, would have held itup to all the PostScript clone vendors as the logical alternative to theclosed Adobe font format.andM;However, the market would have been fragmented, with no single font formatstrong enough to drive others out.andP;  The native Macintosh format and thenative PC format would have been incompatible.andP;  Adobe would still have beenin a strong position because it might end up with the only format that allcomputers (Macs, PCs and Unix workstations) could accommodate.andM;The Apple/Adobe divorce.andP;  Although Microsoft was already well down anotherpath, Apple's announcement this summer that it was selling its Adobe stockand that it was developing its own PostScript clone opened up a newposibility.andP;  Microsoft approached Apple, and both companies quickly decidedthat a common course in fonts and imaging technology would be a big win bothfor the two companies and for their users.andP;  A world that was on the verge offragmenting suddenly coalesced.andM;What next?andM;It certainly appears that from this point forward we are going to have twofont standards and, quite possibly, two standard-setters for PostScript.andO;Although this is not a popular view with users faced with the prospect ofsupporting two standards, we think that two may, in fact, be the optimalnumber in a situation like this.andP;  It provides the impetus of competition inquality of execution, advances to the standard, pricing and availabilitywithout creating unmanageable chaos.andM;One of the most interesting aspects of all of this is that the twocompetitors represent such distinctly different backgrounds, cultures andapproaches.andP;  The two competing font technologies are almost diametricopposites.andM;Adobe uses a simple hinting scheme and places more of the intelligence in therasterizer.andP;  This is why it was able to develop a new rasterizer--ATM--thatproduces significantly better (and faster) results from the same characteroutlines used by the old technology.andM;The Apple scheme places most of the intelligence in theprogramming-language-like character hinting scheme so that the rasterizer canbe simple.andP;  Simple (Level 1) hinting can be relatively straightforward.andP;  Morecomplex (Level 2) hinting will produce better results for screen display andalso for 300-dpi output.andP;  The most complete implementation (Level 3)introduces refinements (e.g., non-linear scaling) that are intended to moreclosely approximate the appearance of typefaces that have been redrawn forbest appearance at different sizes.andP;  Apple and Microsoft are quick to pointout that because everything is in the front, new fonts that contain moreelaborate hints will produce better results with no change to the rasterizer.andM;(See the October Seybold Report on Desktop Publishing for more comments aboutthe two approaches.)andM;A new chapterandM;As we said at the outset, the Microsoft/Apple alliance changes almosteverything.andP;  There are still a lot of different ways that all of this coulddevelop.andP;  Here are some of the things to watch in the coming months:andM;IBM.andP;  Everyone is now waiting to see what IBM will do.andP;  Microsoft conductedmost of its investigation without substantial input from its partner in OS/2Presentation Manager.andP;  Even so, most people have assumed that IBM willvalidate what Microsoft has decided.andM;We do not think that this is a foregone conclusion.andP;  If IBM is serious aboutits commitment to provide transparent data exchange across its entire rangeof products, it is really obligated to have a common font strategy across allof its products: not just PCs, but Unix workstations, minis, mainframes, andthe full range of printers from desktop dot-matrix and laser printers tohigh-volume mainframe output devices.andM;Do not forget, moreover, that IBM already has a fair corporate commitment toAdobe PostScript.andP;  It sells PostScript printers and it has licensed NextStepand Display PostScript.andP;  It has important customers who have made majorcommitments to PostScript and to Adobe fonts based partially on IBM'sendorsement.andP;  We doubt that anyone really knows what IBM will decide to do inthe current circumstance.andM;It has to do something.andP;  At the Conference, Nick Donofrio, head of IBM'sworkstation division, waffled artfully.andP;  He said that IBM will includesupport for Royal technology in its version of OS/2, but he stopped short ofany stronger endorsement.andP;  Given the short time IBM had since Microsoft hadtold it what it intended to do and the far-reaching implications of thedecision, we did not expect anything more.andM;But it must do more in fairly short order.andP;  Bill Gates has clarified theissues for IBM marvelously.andP;  It probably has to support both Microsoft andAdobe in some fashion, but it is hard to see how it can now avoid committingto one or the other as the preferred IBM solution.andM;Sun, HP and OSF.andP;  A good deal of the time pressure on IBM is generated by thefact that other important companies have yet to make up their minds.andP;  Withthe world narrowing its focus to two principal font technologies, SunMicrosystems is going to be under increasing pressure to support one of thesestandards.andP;  Sun is being courted by both sides because both covet its FolioTypeMaker technology.andM;TypeMaker is especially important to Apple, which has no automtic means ofgenerating the hints that Royal depends on.andP;  Hewlett-Packard, for its part,is forgoing ahead with Compugraphic Intellifont.andP;  In an effort to staycompetitive, CG announced at the Conference that it, too, will make its fontformat public so that other companies can offer Intellifont-format fonts andother printer companies can build printers that can use these fonts.andP;  But ifthe PC world really coalesces around Royal, HP is going to come underincreasing pressure to migrate to Royal as well.andM;Open Software Foundation (OSF), the Unix consortium formed by HP, DEC, IBMand others, will also be drawn into the fray.andP;  The OSF Motif graphicenvironment does not currently support scalable outline fonts--a deficiencythat OSF must remedy sooner or later.andP;  If IBM and Hewlett-Packard decide tosupport Royal, we would presume that OSF will as well.andP;  However, if IBM, HPand DEC come down firmly on the Adobe side, then we would presume that OSFwill go this route.andM;Waiting for Godot.andP;  So, at the moment, everyone waits to see what IBM willdecide.andP;  If IBM tilts in favor of Royal, this will certainly increase thepressure on Sun, HP and ultimately OSF (and therefore DEC) to follow suit.andO;If IBM tilts in favor of Adobe, there is a good chance that Sun will do thesame--and quite possibly HP and OSF as well.andM;The font vendors.andP;  At the Conference, Linotype, Monotype, CG and Bitstreamall said that they will support both the Adobe and Royal formats.andP;  Bitsream,which appears to be farthest along with Royal font conversions, said that itis considering packaging its fonts with both formats on the same disk.andP;  Itwill assure customers that the two versions of the face have identical fontmetrics (widths, kerning values, etc.) and can be used interchangeably.andM;Bitstream also said it is developing tools for automatic generation of Royalformat fonts, to be ready to offer to other type vendors by next summer.andM;The other font vendors claim to have less experience with the Royal format.andO;They do not know yet how difficult it will be to prepare Royal format fonts,or how much of the rich Royal hinting language they will ultimately use.andM;Stay tuned.andP;  We'll have more on this and other Conference topics next week inour Report on Desktop Publishing.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
