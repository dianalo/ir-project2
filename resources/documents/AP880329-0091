Under the law, which was passed Monday and takes effect Oct. 1,people convicted of sex offenses will be required to surrender ablood sample. Police will build a genetic library for futureinvestigations.   ``It will be a huge step forward in our ability to apprehend andprosecute rapists,'' said King County Councilman Ron Sims, one ofeight council members taking part in the unanimous vote.   A spokesman for the American Civil Liberties Union endorsedparts of the law but urged the council to delay final action.   ``This would be the first in the nation, and we therefore areresponsible to be sure all issues are understood and agreed to.Take time to analyze. Don't be hasty,'' Jerry Sheehan said.   But the King County prosecutor's office urged the council not tobe intimidated by being first.   ``The fact that we may be the first jurisdiction (to adopt thegenetic fingerprinting legislation) gives us a sense ofresponsibility, but we should not shy away from its extremevalue,'' said Jeffrey Baird, a deputy prosecutor.   Baird said identifying offenders is often the most difficultpart of prosecuting rape cases. ``This evidence will help resolvethe question of identity,'' he said.   The ordinance established a technical committee to guarantee theaccuracy and reliability of the genetic process. A separatecommittee will study how to store and retrieve genetic data.</TEXT></DOC>
