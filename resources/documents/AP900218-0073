It was the first such protest since a mass Soviet Jewishimmigration began last year.   In 1989, about 12,000 Soviet Jews came to Israel. More than8,000 have arrived so far this year, and Israel expects up to100,000 Soviet Jews by year's end due to more liberal Sovietemigration policies, U.S. visa restrictions and risinganti-Semitism in the Soviet Union.   The protesters gathered at Jerusalem's Gilo absorption center,the country's largest. They held signs reading, ``Until now you didnot give me anything,'' and ``New immigrant, your debt to theJewish Agency is eternal.''   The quasi-governmental Jewish Agency helps handle immigrationand is responsible for Gilo, where 850 immigrants live.   The protesters complained that ceilings and walls leaked when itrained and that central heating was turned off.   They said the gas heaters they were given were dangerous,pointing to the case of an elderly Soviet woman who died last monthafter a gas heater explosion at Gilo.   The immigrants, who spoke on condition of anonymity, alsocomplained that families living on $400 a month had to pay $250 inrent at Gilo.   Jewish Agency spokesman Gad Ben-Ari said the agency decided lastweek to close Gilo within a year because of housing qualityproblems. He said Gilo residents would be housed in rentedapartments and public housing until a new absorption center wasbuilt in Jerusalem.   Herzog and a group of dancing children meanwhile greeted 110Soviet Jews who arrived at Ben-Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv fromBudapest, Hungary.   The children gave the immigrants roses and little Israeli flags.But Herzog warned the newcomers not everyhting in Israel would beas pleasant.   Israel is settling many Soviet Jews in the occupied West Bankand Gaza Strip, land it captured during the 1967 Middle East war.Arab nations oppose such a policy and say it will destroy chancesfor peace in the region.   In Manama, Bahrain, the rulers of Bahrain and the United ArabEmirates conferred Sunday amid signs the Arab world was delaying adecision on convening a special summit on the issue.   Emirates President Sheik Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan arrivedSaturday from a visit to Egypt, where he advocated holding thesummit, which was first called for by King Hussein of Jordan twoweeks ago.   The Gulf News Agency said that after his talks Sunday with theemir of Bahrain, Sheik Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa, the two discussedArab issues in talks ``characterized by frankness andunderstanding.''   In Arab diplomatic terminology, ``frank'' indicates differencesof opinion.   Sources said the prospects of a summit and the subjects it wouldtackle, were major issues in the Bahrain talks.   The two countries are grouped with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatarand Oman in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council alliance, whichcoordinates policy on regional, Arab and international issues.   Aside from the statements by Sheik Zayed and a statement fromKuwait, the other alliance members have not picked up Jordan'ssummit call.   Diplomatic sources said the alliance as a whole and othernations of the 22-member Arab League support the idea of a summitbut want it convened only after clearing up inter-Arab differences.Foremost is the feud between Syria and Iraq.</TEXT></DOC>
