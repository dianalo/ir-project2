See sunnyFlorida. Live near the ocean, experience a life that seemedso distant and so bountiful to a single mother of threeliving in the dirt-poor town of Plumerville, Ark., population700.   This dream of a better life visited Sharon Aussler one dayin May 1987, when she picked up a copy of the ArkansasDemocrat. Her eye stopped at classified section 73. And thereit was:   &quot;ATTENTION ALL NURSES. RN's andamp; LPN's needed. RN's $16 to$18 per hour plus housing. LPN's $12.50 hour with temporaryhousing, free travel for all.&quot;   At age 23, Ms. Aussler's life had been marked by fitfulstarts and stops. Since late in her teens, however, shealways had a vocation to fall back on. She was a nurse, alicensed practical nurse. In past years, that would haveguaranteed her a lifetime of options, but times werechanging. As hospitals faced sicker patients and used morecomplex medical equipment, many no longer wanted LPNs, whohad less formal training than registered nurses. LPNs oftengot relegated to depressing nursing home care.   A wave of excitement washed over Ms. Aussler as she dialedthe number listed in the ad. At the other end of the line,she found a pleasant-sounding voice belonging to JulieMonahan, president of All Care Nursing Service of BoyntonBeach, Fla., in Palm Beach County. &quot;There's a big shortage ofnurses in South Florida,&quot; Ms. Monahan explained. &quot;We're kindof close to Miami, but it's not like `Miami Vice.' . . .You'll make $12.50 an hour.&quot; Ms. Monahan also promised toreimburse Ms. Aussler for her flight down, plus she wouldarrange a place for her to stay.   At the time, Ms. Aussler could hardly have imagined whatawaited her. All Care Nursing was part of a shadowy,burgeoning industry providing day-labor nurses to thousandsof medical facilities across America. Although many agencynurses were competent, sometimes excellent, administratorsrightfully felt queasy hiring unknown and unpredictablecontract laborers. But hire them they did. With one in everyeight nursing jobs in hospitals vacant -- one in five in NewYork City -- agencies promised a quick fix, one less worryfor administrators already facing federal cost controls,empty beds, more competition, and the onset of AIDS andcrack. Temps had further appeal because hospitals didn't paythem benefits, and unlike regular employees, they did nothave to be carried on the payroll when patient occupancydropped.   But by succumbing to the quick fix, administrators soonentered a vicious circle: The more they relied on temps, themore they ignored the underlying causes of their nursingshortage, such as poor pay and overwork. And the more theyignored those causes, the more permanent staff nurses theylost, requiring more and more temps. Like a junkie with agrowing habit, hospitals often found one supplier inadequate.Soon, individual hospitals were turning to 10, 15, even 20agencies to meet their growing demand. One midsized Floridahospital used temps to fill 140,000 hours in 1988, whileothers commonly tapped contract labor for 30,000 or 40,000hours annually.   By the late 1980s, more than half of all big-cityhospitals in the U.S. were kept afloat by temp agencies,providing everything from pharmacists to nurses' aides. Theagencies could be as ephemeral as the faceless workers theyprovided, opening and closing like floating crap games. PalmBeach County hosted 60 agencies, more or less, depending onwhich month one did the counting. Free of virtually anygovernment regulation, some set up shop with little more thana telephone and a Rolodex.   The willingness of administrators to gamble on temp nursesof unknown quality was emblematic of the most turbulent,disruptive decade in the history of American hospitals -- adecade when government decided once and for all to endgluttony in the halls of healing, yet health care costssoared from 9% to 12% of the gross national product; a decadein which researchers stunningly concluded that 7,000 patientshad died from negligence in New York State hospitals in justone year, yet the medical community called for less outsidescrutiny rather than more; a decade that began with theReagan administration pushing competition as a solution tohigh hospital costs, yet ended with influential corporationscalling for national health insurance.   Temp agencies found Palm Beach County particularlyinviting. Because residents flooded in and out depending onthe season, patient loads at the dozen or so regionalhospitals fluctuated widely. By helping hospitals varystaffing levels, agencies had more business than they couldhandle, giving rise to the birth of new agencies. One areahospital, during one seven-month stretch in 1989, boughtlabor from 20 different agencies bearing such names as Angelsin White, Nurse on Call and Team Nursing.   Complaints rolled in from doctors and nurses about thequality of the labor some temps provided. &quot;After they workeda shift, you would question where they got their nursingcredentials,&quot; said Sue Bradford, nursing director at DelrayCommunity Hospital. Patients never knew that the nurseinjecting a needle into their vein was as much a stranger tothe hospital as to them.   When hospitals discovered an unsuitable worker, theymerely told the sponsoring agency not to send that personagain. &quot;We simply just took the posture that as long as it'snot happening at my facility, what do I care?&quot; said PeterFaron of Palm Beach Regional Hospital.   Sharon Aussler stepped into this world, after leaving herchildren with relatives, just before the July 4 holiday whenshe arrived in Boynton Beach and met Julie Monahan. Ms.Monahan's casual dress cast her as an unlikely chiefexecutive of an agency with $6 million in annual grossincome. Her attire, according to an All Care customer, wasyour standard &quot;flip-flops and shorts, that sort of thing.&quot;Her appearance, however, belied a keen business mind and acompetitive edge. She battled bigger nationwide agencies oneven terms by playing tougher and smarter. With only so manynurses in Palm Beach County, she devised a strategy of usingnewspaper ads to target nurses in economically depressedareas in Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana, Tennessee, and NorthCarolina. By the late 1980s, All Care was one of the biggestagencies in Palm Beach County.   Sharon Aussler was a recruit who would depend heavily onAll Care for help in adjusting to her new life in Florida.She had no car, no place to live, little money, and at leastinitially no local friends. All Care functioned as herumbilical cord to the world, providing at times everythingfrom local transportation to cheap lodging.   Ms. Aussler actually lived in All Care's headquarters,located in a modest one-story house in a semi-residentialneighborhood several blocks from doctors' offices andBethesda Hospital. Most nurses who lived here -- Ms. Monahanalso provided living quarters elsewhere in the city -- weregiven beds in a larger room, while others stayed elsewhere inthe house, which included another room, a kitchen, twobathrooms, and an office that served as All Care's nervecenter, filled with file cabinets, desks, and telephones.   A house that an upper-middle class family of four mightfind comfortable instead provided shelter for as many as 18people, according to one former All Care employee. Ms.Monahan said the most was &quot;probably 10 or 11.&quot; Even so, thatdidn't include the office staff that often labored from dawnuntil 1 a.m., smoking cigarettes, typing, running thephotocopying machine, and working the phones.   Ms. Aussler signed a three-month work agreement with AllCare and got her first assignment when an overnight shiftneeded filling. All Care put Ms. Aussler to work without, shesaid, either testing her nursing knowledge or administeringany other screening exams. (Ms. Monahan terminated aninterview before she could be asked about that allegation.)Ms. Aussler's first job turned out fine, but there wassomething about Ms. Monahan that didn't seem quite right.Soon after arriving at All Care, she was sitting with somefellow nurses, when Ms. Monahan suddenly appeared. &quot;You arehere to work,&quot; Ms. Aussler said Ms. Monahan told her. &quot;If yougo to the beach, I want to know it. And I want to knowexactly which beach you go to.&quot;   Standing up to Julie Monahan might sound simple; it wasanything but. &quot;Julie had a very, very strong personality,&quot;said John Roylance, who worked for All Care as a nursingassistant in the early 1980s. Ms. Monahan could be mostgenerous, or very nasty, he said. But there was anotherelement to her personality that stood above all the rest.&quot;There's no polite way to put it: Julie has a mouth like alongshoreman,&quot; Mr. Roylance said. &quot;I was brought up inHoboken {N.J.} and I'm familiar with longshoremen.&quot; (Ms.Monahan denied ever directing abusive language at anyemployee, although she acknowledged that she occasionallyswears.)   Sharon Aussler disliked her cramped housing, but shedidn't mind it as much as she might have under differentcircumstances. That was because in the beginning she spentlittle time there. When not working, she usually slept. Whennot sleeping, she worked. And there seemed to be a lot moreof the latter than the former.   With hospitals spending so much money on temps (JFKMedical Center in Palm Beach County doled out $1.7 millionfor temp nurses during one four-month period), Ms. Monahaneagerly sought to get her share. In 1988, All Care filled23,725 eight-hour nursing shifts at area hospitals. Abouthalf of All Care's shifts were in nursing homes.   To meet the demand, Ms. Monahan tried to squeeze as muchas possible from her stable of workers. And when that wasn'tenough, her workers say she squeezed some more. &quot;We were notasked do we want to go to work, we were told we had to go towork,&quot; Ms. Aussler said. Nurses worked 16-hour days and20-hour days. Even worse, the shifts were often strungtogether one after another, a nightmare seemingly withoutend.   &quot;There were people sleep walking, sleep talking,&quot; Ms.Aussler said. &quot;I was sleeping in the bathrooms in {medical}facilities. I was sleeping on the floors, anywhere I couldcatch a nap I would do it. I was not the only one.&quot;   Weary nurses would help each other, one watching the floorwhile the other slept. When Ms. Aussler finally did collapsein exhaustion at home, there always seemed to be someonekicking her bed, telling her to get up and begin the wholeprocess all over again. &quot;I was never Sharon, I was always awhore, or a bitch, or a slut, or a c-,&quot; Ms. Aussler recalled.&quot;I did not come to Florida to be treated like a dog. I cameto Florida to make a life for me and my three kids. . . . Atleast a dog can run somewhere.&quot; Sometimes Ms. Aussler wouldsit with her roommates and cry in frustration.   (Ms. Monahan said nurses could have left any time theycared to, even though they had signed work agreements.)   Working 80 or more hours a week took an immense toll onthe nurses, not to mention their patients. Ms. Aussler saidshe was so tired she sometimes couldn't read a patient'smedication record. And if she couldn't understand it, she didnothing, figuring no medication was better than an overdose.&quot;I got to the point where I would skip some patients just tobe done,&quot; she recalled. Sometimes she decided who gotmedicine and who didn't by how much work was involved. Apatient on a heavy regimen of medication got nothing. Apatient requiring only one or two pills got them.   This haphazard triage system developed because agencynurses were judged, in part, on their ability to cover acertain number of patients in a certain period of time. Atired nurse who moved too slowly might not be asked toreturn. Ms. Aussler's conduct was guided not by nursing'snoble mission, but a cold, crass assessment of her ownself-interest, which she explained this way: &quot;A patient, ifhe doesn't know his name, can't tell anybody if he had hismedicine or not.&quot; Ms. Aussler didn't feel good about what shewas doing, and she said other nurses felt the same way.   &quot;I  put myself and a lot of patients in jeopardy,&quot; shesaid, although she doesn't know if anyone was harmed.   (Ms. Monahan said she was shocked to hear Ms. Aussler sayshe was too tired to give medicine to patients. &quot;I wasn't hershadow,&quot; Ms. Monahan said. &quot;Did All Care send her out whenshe was too tired to do her job? I have no idea. I just can'tbelieve she would do that.&quot;)   Hospital officials knew that temp nurses were showing upfor duty exhausted from other shifts, but they felt powerlessto stop it. By the time they recognized the problem, it wastoo late; their patients needed care, and a tired nurse wasbetter than no nurse.   One day in a private moment, a temp named Becky Seibertconfessed something to Sharon Aussler: Although she was alicensed practical nurse, she had been working as aregistered nurse. About a week before Christmas in 1987, Ms.Seibert said Julie Monahan came to her with an unusualrequest. &quot;Can you work this evening as an RN?&quot; she asked.&quot;This nursing home needs an RN on the premises.&quot;   &quot;But I'm not an RN. What do I do? How do I do this?&quot;   &quot;Just scribble RN after your signature and do your job.&quot;   (RNs must meet more rigorous educational standards thanLPNs and carry greater responsibilities for patient care. RNsevaluate a patient's condition, then devise and manage a planof care. An LPN merely carries out an RN's orders.)   Ms. Seibert said Ms. Monahan discussed how to camouflagethe RN notation that was supposed to follow her signature. Bysigning a sloppy RN, Ms. Seibert could later deny, ifnecessary, that she wrote it. She practiced scribbling RNseveral times on a scratch sheet of paper.   &quot;That's fine,&quot; Ms. Monahan observed. Later, through herlawyer, Ms. Monahan denied that she ever knowingly sent out aworker to fill a job without the proper license.   Now, Ms. Seibert suggested that Ms. Aussler should do it,too. &quot;Sharon,&quot; she said, &quot;you can do it. Just go in and actlike you know what you're doing. I've been a nursingsupervisor. There's nothing to it.&quot;   Ms. Aussler was shocked. &quot;Becky, what are you going to doif a patient codes {needs to be resuscitated}?&quot; she asked.&quot;You might have to start an IV, push medicine through the IV.We're not licensed to do that.&quot;   &quot;I'm going to dial 911,&quot; Ms. Seibert said, a retort bettersuited to a Mel Brooks movie than a medical facility.   Ms. Seibert said she eventually posed as an RN for about ahalf-dozen shifts in several medical facilities. As she bentthe rules, she began to wonder about others who worked besideher -- like the LPN who didn't seem to know how to do asimple tube feeding. It was almost as if she had never doneit before, Ms. Seibert thought.   Ms. Aussler had also heard of some strange goings on.Besides Becky Seibert, two other LPNs told her they had posedas RNs, Ms. Aussler said. She also suspected, although shehad no specific proof, that certain individuals were posingas certified nurses aides, or CNAs. Her first tip: They couldhardly speak English. &quot;There is no way I felt they could evenpass CNA school,&quot; she said. &quot;When you say go give a bath andthey tell you, `Me don't speak no English.' If you're anurse's aide you got to know when somebody tells you go givea bath.&quot; Some CNAs merely showed up for work, grabbed ablanket and laid down.   CNAs were supposed to do more than just clean patients.They should know how to take a patient's vital signs, such astemperature and blood pressure. Ms. Aussler, however, sawtemp CNAs who could do neither. &quot;I had a nurse's aide fromAll Care give me a 110 temp,&quot; she said.   Sharon Aussler couldn't have been happier to see the finaldays of her three-month All Care contract winding down.Before she actually walked out the door, however, she reacheda big decision; she would make one dramatic attempt to geteven.   It was early October 1987 -- two nights before she was toleave -- when Ms. Aussler made her move. Waiting until theoffice closed and the nurses were asleep, she walked into AllCare's file room. It was after 1 a.m. As she stopped at theoffice's personnel files, her mind flashed to the stories shehad heard of unqualified people being sent out on assignment.Now, she had come to copy their records. Two days later, atdawn, she gathered up her things, including the copieddocuments, and left All Care for good.   Ms. Aussler anonymously shipped her records to theDepartment of Professional Regulation, the administrative armof the Florida Board of Nursing. She would later say sheturned over the documents not just for revenge, but for othernurses as well. &quot;I don't want anybody to have to go throughwhat I went through,&quot; Ms. Aussler said. &quot;You go to nursingschool to be a professional, to care for people.&quot; Working forAll Care, she said, made her lose sight of that commitment.   The state filed an administrative complaint against JulieMonahan, RN, accusing her of unprofessional conduct. Inresponse, Ms. Monahan provided investigators with a swornstatement in which she said her business &quot;lends itself to ahigh probability of dealing with disgruntled independentcontractors and the possibility of making bookkeepingerrors.&quot; Ms. Monahan admitted that Becky Seibert &quot;may havebeen incorrectly billed as an RN on three or four occasions,&quot;but, she added, that couldn't be confirmed because certainrecords weren't available. Ms. Monahan also said another LPNwas possibly billed as an RN but that the nurse in questiondenied working beyond her license. Above all, Ms. Monahantold investigators that she never knowingly sent anunqualified worker into the field.   At any rate, on Oct. 12, 1989, at the Howard JohnsonDowntown Hotel in Orlando, Ms. Monahan came forward to pleadher case before a meeting of the Florida Board of Nursing.The complaint included the serious allegation that Ms.Monahan &quot;on numerous occasions. . . placed persons inpositions for which they were not qualified.&quot; Once thehearing began, however, the state quickly dropped thisallegation for lack of evidence. That left only billingerrors.   Ms. Monahan's lawyer, Donald Orlovsky, began her defenseby pointing out that she did business with more than 100hospitals and nursing homes, and employed 500 nurses. Withthat out of the way, Mr. Orlovsky got to the point. &quot;Thebackground of the investigation was initiated underprecarious, at best, circumstances,&quot; he said. &quot;It wasinitiated anonymously by a disgruntled employee, we believe.&quot;He then submitted a letter to the board from a nurse, BessieTikker, which he said suggested that someone had altered AllCare's records before delivering them to state regulators.   &quot;I have statements from members of the community detailingtheir views of Ms. Monahan as a businesswoman and heragencies,&quot; Mr. Orlovsky continued. &quot;Uniformly, they regardher as honest, a person of integrity, a person withprofessional significance in nursing, a philanthropist, and anursing teaching advocate.&quot; (The state couldn't counter thosestatements because, according to government records,investigators didn't know Ms. Aussler's identity andtherefore couldn't produce her as a witness. The state alsofailed to locate and interview Ms. Seibert.)   Mr. Orlovsky downplayed the six apparent billing errors.&quot;The errors in question, if they occurred, amounted to nomore than $100. They took place in a volume of business thatinvolved 46,000 shifts.&quot; Bonnie Phipps, an investigator withthe Department of Professional Regulation, concurred thatmost of the people she talked to, including officials athospitals and nursing facilities, said Ms. Monahan was a finecitizen.   After a few preliminaries, the following exchanges tookplace between Ms. Monahan and several questioners.   QUESTIONER: Ms. Monahan, can you tell us what you thinkoccurred in the specific six cases?   MONAHAN: I hope I don't cry.   QUESTIONER: You're doing good. Take some water.   MONAHAN: I have a letter here. Jesus, I'm sorry (Ms.Monahan cries).   QUESTIONER: That's all right. You're doing good.   MONAHAN: It is brought to my attention this week whathappened. I'm sorry (Ms. Monahan cries).   QUESTIONER: That's all right. Drink some water if you wantto. . .   MONAHAN: . . . I thought I had been framed, you know. Anurse came in and told me, she had seen them doing it, and --I'm sorry. God, I'm crying.   QUESTIONER: . . . . Have you worked very hard to get whereyou are today?   MONAHAN: You bet.   QUESTIONER: . . . It's not beyond the scope of reality, Idon't think, to anyone sitting here that there are going tobe the possibility of some errors, and the fact is that youhave undoubtedly dealt with those in an appropriate manner oryou wouldn't be held in the esteem that you are by thecommunity.   MONAHAN: Sir, I have installed a computer and I also puteverything under lock and key.   QUESTIONER: You'll love the computer. By the hearing'send, the Florida Board of Nursing enthusiastically gave Ms.Monahan a clean bill of health. All charges were dismissed.   Meanwhile, a different and more far-reaching attack ontemp agencies was quietly playing out back in Palm BeachCounty. Periodically, the heads of various hospital nursingdepartments got together to discuss their mutual problems,including temp agencies that dumped poor quality workers onthem while charging high prices. From these meetings sprangan idea: Why don't area hospitals band together and say ineffect, &quot;We won't buy any temps from agencies that don't meetour qualifications&quot;?   With the help of the South Florida Hospital Association,nine hospitals solicited bids from area agencies, thenselected eight agencies as &quot;preferred providers.&quot; All Carewasn't one of them. Agencies not selected were understandablyunhappy and filed an antitrust lawsuit against the hospitalassociation and the hospitals.   The hospitals, recognizing their potential liability,probed aggressively into the backgrounds of the agencies.And, unlike the state of Florida's timid regulatory effort,the hospitals didn't conduct a narrow, low-budgetinvestigation. Spearheading their probe was the Miami lawfirm of Mershon, Sawyer, Johnson, Dunwody andamp; Cole. It hired atenacious private investigator named Tom Whiteman to trackdown ex-employees of All Care, as well as other agencies. Hequickly hit paydirt.   Based on records they had obtained and Mr. Whiteman'sspadework, the hospitals filed court papers in the antitrustsuit charging that Ms. Monahan orchestrated a scheme -- whichshe denied -- whereby &quot;individuals with absolutely no nursingtraining were recruited and . . . sent to hospitals andmisrepresented to be trained health care personnel. Licensecredentials were forged and altered and untrained personswere provided with answers to medicine tests and other skillstests, all so these individuals could avoid detection. Inshort, All Care, through its owner Julie Monahan, took everyconceivable step to deceive hospitals . . . without theslightest regard for the welfare of the patients for whomthese untrained individuals were caring.&quot; The law firm, forexample, obtained sworn testimony that All Care had sent outa secretary, a construction worker and a commercialspray-painter to render nursing care.   But Ms. Monahan's lawyer, Helen McAfee, said Mershon,Sawyer counseled the hospital association in setting up apreferred provider organization that allegedly violatedantitrust laws and now was &quot;throwing dirt&quot; because it hadneither the facts nor the law on its side.   As the year 1990 came to an end -- a full nine monthsafter Mershon, Sawyer filed public papers in court alleginggross misconduct by All Care -- state regulators still hadn'tbothered to investigate those charges. The same couldn't besaid of the federal government, however. It disclosed that itwas conducting an investigation of certain Palm Beach Countyhospitals on the grounds that they may have violated federalantitrust laws when they tried to control the quality andpricing of temp agencies. The hospitals denied the charges.   As for Sharon Aussler, she continues to work as a nurse,although she said she will never feel the same about herprofession. &quot;I did the right thing a long time ago to stopwhat was going on at All Care,&quot; she said, &quot;and nothinghappened.&quot;   ---   Copyright 1991 by Walt Bogdanich.
