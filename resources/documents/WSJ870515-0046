Although it's too soon to call, the funds may have reason to be jittery. Much of their growth in the past two years of declining interest rates has come from investors shopping for higher-yielding alternatives to maturing bank certificates of deposit. What's more, diversification-minded banks have shown more interest lately in the securities and individual-investment business.    The recent rise in interest rates spurred many New York City banks to start paying premium rates on certain CD accounts. In some cases CD rates have risen 1 1/2 percentage points above the dormant level of the past two years. Investors willing to tie up their dollars for a year and include some other assets in a so-called &quot;relationship&quot; account can now earn 7.3% on a bank CD. In comparison, the average taxable money market fund yields 5.91%, still ahead of comparable bank money-market accounts.    &quot;If a bank wants to go out and buy deposits, they can,&quot; says Gerald Cole, head of money market funds at Kemper Financial Services, Chicago. Unlike banks, money market mutual funds can't pay out more than what the instruments in their money market portfolios earn.    Kemper, which oversees about $12.5 billion in money market fund assets, hasn't been affected by the banks' bid, says Mr. Cole. He and others note that investors have developed unique needs for their money market mutual funds. These include ready access through check writing and a sort of &quot;safe haven&quot; to park proceeds from their other mutual funds in nervous markets.    Still, Mr. Cole concedes, &quot;I'd hate to be cavalier about it. I think everybody is a competitor.&quot;    One reason fund executives aren't too concerned yet is that they believe the banks aren't offering as big a premium as they did during their last major competitive move in 1982.    What's more, money market fund rates are ratcheting up, although they lag the interest rate gains a bit.    &quot;I don't think these CD kickups are kicking up enough,&quot; says Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services Inc. &quot;If they start accelerating, that's something else,&quot; he adds.    In 1982, banks offered controversial premium rates when they launched their money market deposit accounts in direct competition to the funds. Money market mutual funds peaked at $232.6 billion in December 1982 only to fall back to a low of $163.5 billion two years later as they lost ground to the bank accounts.    For the week ended Wednesday, money market funds fell $683.4 million to $235.63 billion, according to the Investment Company Institute, an industry trade group. But most of the decline was in institutional funds, not the general retail funds that might be affected by a competitive consumer product.    &quot;So you can't see New York competition in those numbers,&quot; says Alfred Johnson, ICI chief economist.    Still, some of the banks say the CD campaigns are drawing in new money from money market mutual funds as well as from lower-rate CDs and other low-rate bank accounts.    &quot;We've had quite a bit of response to our ads since they started running Monday,&quot; says a spokesman for Chemical Bank. &quot;A lot of it is coming out of money market accounts although we can't document it,&quot; he adds.    The advertising arena may be a likely field to watch for any return salvos by the mutual funds, executives say. With interest rates creeping up in recent weeks, the current yields on some fixed-income funds is also creeping up. That means more yield figures may start appearing in fixed-income ads.    &quot;People do buy yield,&quot; says the head of one mutual fund group, although some industry watchers are concerned that investors focus too much on yield alone.    Some investors recently learned the hard way that rising interest rates can hurt the principal value in their longer-maturity bond funds. That reduces total return substantially, even as yields rise. Some moved into money market funds and may still be shopping around for an alternative investment.    Still, several mutual fund groups including Kemper, Fidelity Investment, T. Rowe Price Associates and Vanguard Group of Investment Cos. said they haven't seen any movement out of their money market funds.    James W. Fuller, president of the Bull andamp; Bear Group says &quot;we watch our redemptions every day and we haven't seen it yet.&quot;    Mr. Fuller adds that if it looks like the bank campaigns are making inroads his firm &quot;will point out products we consider alternatives or quasi-alternatives.&quot;    Ginnie Mae funds, for instance, have fluctuating net asset values but often offer check writing -- a combination that can confuse investors about the funds' risk level.    Still, with the recent rise in interest rates, the current yield on Ginnie Maes is also edging up over 9%.    &quot;People are attracted by double-digit numbers,&quot; says Mr. Fuller. If rates keep on the current track and his Ginnie Mae fund hits the 10% mark, &quot;we'll make sure people are aware of that. We'll advertise that.&quot;    The ICI's Mr. Johnson points out that there are clear distinctions among the funds that might be considered alternatives for a CD. Still, he adds: &quot;Of course, all products compete one against the other to some degree. There clearly is some play between what happens to CD rates and what is offered to bond and income funds and even equity funds.&quot;    ---   Money Fund Assets Drop   NEW YORK -- Assets of the nation's 381 money market funds fell $683.4 million to $235.63 billion in the week ended Wednesday, the third drop in as many weeks.
