Sikorsky, a division of United Technologies Corp., Hartford, Conn., said it discovered in mid-April that it had charged the government $75 million for parts and services sooner than it should have. The error, a Sikorsky spokesman said, was the result of a computer software glitch.    The extra billings involved monthly progress, or installment, payments the government made to Sikorsky. Because of the high cost of helicopter parts, Sikorsky billed the government on a monthly basis rather than presenting a final bill upon delivery of an aircraft. The monthly payments varied depending on the amount of work done during that period.    Sikorsky started to run a check on its computer software system last summer after the government asked 300 contractors to look for errors in their software systems. A government review of those systems had indicated that some were &quot;unreliable,&quot; said Phillip E. Rogers, executive officer of the Pentagon's Defense Contract Audit Agency.    A number of contractors have reported software problems, Mr. Rogers said, but Sikorsky's extra billings have been the largest discovered so far.    Sikorsky, the biggest supplier of helicopters to the U.S. military, last year billed the government $1.3 billion. It delivered 156 helicopters, the bulk of which were Black Hawk and Seahawk designs.    At no time was the government overcharged for the helicopters, said H. Stephen Harvey, Sikorsky's chief financial officer. &quot;We just collected $75 million earlier than we should have,&quot; he said.    Sikorsky officials currently are meeting with officials of the Pentagon agency to determine what caused the billing error. Both sides say they have few clues.    Part of the problem is that Sikorsky doesn't keep records tracking costs on a monthly basis. Each month the records are updated, but the billings are computed on a cumulative basis. &quot;There's no way of knowing&quot; over what period of time the $75 million in extra payments accumulated, or even whether there was a monthly float of money that Sikorsky received from the government, said Sikorsky's Mr. Harvey.    &quot;Indications so far&quot; point to &quot;duplicate billing&quot; for material, Mr. Rogers said. &quot;There is no indication at this time of fraud but it's certainly a possibility. It isn't permissible to bill costs twice. Hopefully, the reason is just errors&quot; in the computer software.    Asked about the possibility of duplicate billing or fraud, Mr. Harvey said &quot;impossible&quot; and &quot;absolutely not.&quot; He said the computer system has been in operation for at least eight years and has been audited and approved by the government. </TEXT></DOC>
