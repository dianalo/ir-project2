But what if every bankin the neighborhood is ailing?   That's the fix many businesses in New Hampshire are in.</LP><TEXT>   Of the five biggest banks in the state, all five arehurting. One is already insolvent, and all the others haveperilously low levels of capital. Their problems have hitthis state like a mountain snow squall, sending itsonce-booming economy into a deep chill.   Here in the state capital, Crathern Co., a growingmachinery maker with 200 employees and 25 years in business,has seen its credit line cut in half, slowing its push intonew export markets. This has happened even though its bankadmits Crathern is a healthy company.   Barretto Granite Co., a quarry in Milford, laid off 56employees at Christmas after it couldn't find the temporaryfinancing it uses to tide it over the winter months.   And despite a drop in the prime rate nationwide,ComputerTown Inc.'s bank raised the interest rate on one loanby a percentage point, and called in a second credit line.The long-established Salem retailer had never missed a loanpayment.   As a recession-burdened nation wrestles with a creditcrunch, New Hampshire's predicament shows what can happenwhen such problems reach critical mass. Lenders' problemshave sent the state's already weak economy into a &quot;deathspiral,&quot; asserts Christopher Gallagher, counsel to the NewHampshire Bankers Association. The state thus has become anexhibit of how closely banks and business activity areintertwined and what happens when one element isn'tfunctioning well.   Banking ills are so acute here that the state is expectedto become a testing ground for some controversial newtreatments, such as involuntary mergers and hybridrecapitalizations using both public and private funds. FDICChairman William Seidman was in New Hampshire yesterday,outlining just such plans. With or without federal help, theconsolidation and tumult here could foreshadow the fate ofbanks across the Northeast.   &quot;We have to try new ideas, not just follow the Southwestmodel of collapse and seizure,&quot; says Gov. Judd Gregg, aRepublican whose inauguration speech last month cited bankingas the state's most pressing problem.   Once the wellspring of Yankee thrift and flintyconservatism, New Hampshire in the 1980s was transformed byexplosive economic and population growth. Banks rode the boomfor all it was worth. They pumped cash into fast-appreciatingreal estate and resort projects, often lending 110% to 120%of the developers' needs.   But just as New Hampshire had become bedroom andplayground to its southern New England neighbors, it nowshares their economic agony. Empty, foreclosed ski condoscrowd half-developed mountainsides. Wave after wave oflayoffs has hit the computer makers, defense contractors andconstruction companies that had fueled the state's growth. Astate that two years ago had a mere 2.2% unemployment ratehas seen it nearly triple to 6.3% (in December). Businessfailures soared from 82 in the first nine months of 1989 to215 in the similar period last year, according to Dun andamp;Bradstreet.   This economic spiral has had various causes. The problemnow is that the state's largest banks, crippled by thecollapse of real estate prices, can't help the economy pullout of the dive. Forced to set aside more and more reservesfor non-performing loans, they find their capital so depletedthat they not only can't make new loans, they have to callothers in.   Not every bank has stopped lending. Fleet/Norstar'sFleet/Bank of New Hampshire and First New Hampshire Bank,owned by Bank of Ireland, are still lending despite havinghad major losses during the year -- thanks to the strength oftheir corporate parents. And there are scores of relativelyhealthy small-town banks.   But nearly &quot;all the banks that matter are on the brink,&quot;and some might not survive the year, says Gerard Cassidy, ananalyst with Tucker, Anthony Inc. in Portland, Maine. Thefive ailing large banks aren't huge, but together theycontrol a towering 45% of the state's banking assets.   Bank executives concede that they have serious problemsbut say they're working with regulators and potentialinvestors to recover. &quot;It's extremely frustrating not beingable to meet legitimate credit needs of our customers and thecommunity,&quot; says the president of one of the five, LawrenceConnell of New Hampshire Savings Bank in Concord. The bank,which has assets of $1.24 billion, is technically insolvent.Mr. Connell notes that its borrowers include Crathern, themachinery maker, &quot;a healthy company in growth mode -- and wecan't help them anymore.&quot; Generally, however, the banks won'tdiscuss specific loans or clients.   Amoskeag Bank Shares, the state's largest bank with $1.74billion in assets, had a loss of $45 million in the firstnine months of 1990, while non-performing assets soared to$213 million, or 12.2% of assets. Three others -- DartmouthBancorp, Numerica Financial Corp. and BankEast Corp., whichhas filed for bankruptcy-court protection -- have seencapital levels slump well below the 5% level regulatorsconsider healthy. All are expected to report fourth-quarterlosses that will further shrink their capital.   The problems are bringing in a new breed of banker. &quot;I'mthe clean-up man,&quot; says Mr. Connell, whom New HampshireSavings hired last year to dig it out from a mound of sourloans. He recruited a &quot;SWAT team&quot; of Texans and other workoutartists who learned the trade in the catastrophic bankfailures of the Southwest.   The new bankers and their demands rattle the Yankees.&quot;These people aren't loan officers, they're liquidators --their mission is to call loans,&quot; charges John W. Merchant, aSalem businessman. &quot;You discover one day that the friendlybanker you've worked with for the last seven years has beenfired, and the new guy only wants to know how soon he cancollect,&quot; he adds. &quot;For a small-business man, a close bankingrelationship is important, especially when times are hard.Then overnight, it all goes out the window.&quot;   Mr. Merchant says his small medical-supply business can'tfind a bank to finance receivables. &quot;We could handle a lotmore business if we had credit,&quot; he says.   For Alex Ray, the credit crunch hit home as he foundhimself behind his Concord diner, the Common Man, standing inthe dumpster and jumping up and down on the trash bags toclose the lid. To save money, &quot;We renegotiated our contractwith the trash hauler,&quot; he explains. &quot;They're only comingonce a week now.&quot; At each of his six restaurants, he hasfound ways to cut costs and stay profitable. Mr. Ray says hisbankers have made clear they need to see solid results -- theregulators are coming back soon. He also says he has had toshelve plans to buy a site for another restaurant because hecan't get financing.   Other business people bitterly complain that where creditis still available, it is sharply more expensive, even thoughinterest rates are dropping nationwide. Tom Jacobs, presidentof ComputerTown, the Salem retailer, says the rate on a loanwas raised to 2 1/2 percentage points above prime from 1 1/2points above. The bank also lowered the appraised value ofreal estate held as collateral, he says, and demanded he cutthe outstanding principal of the loan. And it called a $1million credit line for receivables.   &quot;In a dying economy, the banks are making it even harderto survive,&quot; Mr. Jacobs says. ComputerTown had a bad year in1989 and into 1990, he says, but is profitable again aftershrinking the payroll from 125 to 40.   Even seemingly moderate-risk loans command high interestrates. Stephen Day, president of First Federal Properties, asouthern New Hampshire developer, recently built a restaurantwith a short-term construction loan. Normally this would thenbe replaced by a mortgage, but he can't find one at areasonable rate. This is so even though he has a tenant, apizza chain, that has signed a 20-year lease yielding$170,000 net rental income a year.   Mr. Day has had offers, but at astronomical rates. Onefirm wanted a fee total of eight &quot;points,&quot; or $88,000 upfront, to arrange a loan. A Massachusetts bank offered amortgage, but only if First Federal agreed to buy threebusted condos at the Waterville Valley ski area. Mr. Dayfigured the effective annual cost of such a loan package at16%, plus a potential $135,000 loss if the condo marketdidn't recover. &quot;They were actually serious,&quot; he says.   Start-up companies, which don't find financing very easyin any market, have been especially hard hit by this one. InLincoln, Mary Garland began tiny Area Mountain Travel toprovide a single toll-free reservation line serving five skiresorts. The idea clicked, and bookings rose from $228,000 in1989 to $350,000 last year. But she needs new workingcapital, and most bankers won't even return her calls. Lastweek, an initial $15,000 credit line was called. &quot;I've got aviable business,&quot; she insists. &quot;I just can't get the money togrow.&quot;   Another startup, Gemini Software Inc., could go out ofbusiness despite recently landing a big new salesopportunity, says its president, Robert Montgomery. Herecently signed an agreement with a computer maker that couldyield sales of $500,000 this year, he says. But instead ofconcentrating on this business, he is seeking financing. LastJune his bank called a $150,000 note that was secured in partby his home. Now Mr. Montgomery is talking to banks in NewYork and Montreal. &quot;If something doesn't happen by the end ofthe month, I don't know what we're going to do,&quot; he says.   To ease the crunch, Gov. Gregg is asking federalregulators to help recapitalize the troubled large banks.Yesterday he convened a New England bank summit in Nashua, atwhich Mr. Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp., endorsed the idea of helping banks before they fail.Many of &quot;New Hampshire's larger banks have severe problems,and given the natural course of events they are likely tofail,&quot; Mr. Seidman said. &quot;This will be a long, drawn-outprocess, costly to the economy. . . . We want to get in nowand see if we can prevent failures.&quot;   Among the ways he said regulators could help banks wouldbe through accounting techniques: permitting &quot;loansplitting&quot;-- a procedure that lets banks write off part of a loan andcontinue earning income on the balance -- and supporting &quot;arealistic market analysis of real estate, not justliquidation values.&quot;   The theory is that these approaches might attract privatecapital to the banks, shoring them up before they become soweak they need to be seized. In return for federalassistance, regulators would be expected to demand mergersamong weak banks to rid the system of excess capacity and cutcosts.   But some bankers say it won't be a simple procedure. Forone thing, all this takes time, and the condition of somebanks is rapidly worsening as the recession wears on.Moreover, deep-pocketed investors might prefer to snap updistressed banks in bigger markets than New Hampshire's, suchas Massachusetts and Connecticut.   Bankers themselves, despite their difficulties, might alsobalk. &quot;The regulators have always said that if you were partof the problem you won't be part of the solution -- and in atleast some cases the existing CEOs were indeed part of theproblem,&quot; says Robert Keller, who joined Dartmouth Bancorp aspresident and chief executive last year. &quot;So they aren'tgoing to walk in and say, `Here we are, take us over.' It'sgoing to be a lot more complicated than that.&quot;   Nonetheless, they may have little choice. New Hampshirebanks &quot;are in critical condition, and there's no sign yetthat we've hit bottom,&quot; Mr. Keller says.   ---                        State of Unease                                                                                                          Major New Hamshire banks ranked by total assets, as ofNov. 30, 1990                                                                                                                           TOTAL        NON-PERFORMING                    ASSETS      ASSETS AS A PERCENT  CAPITAL                (in billions)    OF TOTAL ASSETS      LEVEL*                                                                                                        Amoskeag Bank Shares      $1.745             12.2%            2.92                                                                                                        New Hamshire Savings Bank      1.240             13.6            -0.37                                                                                                        Dartmouth Bancorp           1.024             15.6             1.79                                                                                                        Numerica Financial Corp.   0.990              8.0             2.75                                                                                                        BankEast Corp.    0.954              9.7             2.66                                                                                                          *Ratio of tangible equity to assets; 5% is consideredhealthy                                                                                                          Source: First Albany Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
