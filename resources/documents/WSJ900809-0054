Tobacco is the only drug that has absolutely no good uses,especially when used as intended. Yet, the tobacco industry(death merchants) and many smokers continue to fabricateexcuses to allow this travesty to continue, rather than towork to find ways to solve the multitude of problems createdby tobacco consumption.</LP><TEXT>   When I hear of the tobacco states creating legislation toactually promote smoking, rather than to attempt to curb it,I can only say that the responsible politicians are notexercising the prime objective of the government: to protectthe people.   A lot of people in this country need to wake up. While weclaim to be fighting a &quot;war on drugs,&quot; the tobacco industrycontinues to commit homicide at the rate of 400,000 Americanseach year. We must do everything we can to stop them.   Douglas F. Hindle Jr.   Arlington, Texas</TEXT></DOC>
