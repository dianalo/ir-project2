Also in December 1987, Loma Linda established a procedure foraccepting anencephalic infants as prospective organ donors. Thebabies would be placed on respirators for up to seven days awaitingcessation of brain stem function.   The California medical center's program was established at theurging of many parents of anencephalic infants, most notably Brendaand Michael Winner of Arcadia, Calif., who were determined to sharetheir unborn daughter's organs.   But Jarren Winner was stillborn on Dec. 22, 1987, dashing theirhopes. She was cremated and her ashes placed in a silver urndecorated with turquoise, her birthstone. The urn is prominentlydisplayed on a living room shelf.   ``I was very proud of her. From the neck down, she wasperfect,'' said Mrs. Winner, 33, who is writing a book titled ``TenPerfect Fingers.''   Above the neck, though, Jarren was fatally flawed.   ``If you go right above the forehead and saw off the back of herhead, that's what it looks like,'' Mrs. Winner said. ``It was allopen. It looked like liver in a butcher market ... with the brainstem protruding.''   Loma Linda suspended its program last July after only two of 12babies met brain death standards. Neither became a donor, onebecause the organs were no longer viable and the other because nosuitable recipient was found.   ``Twelve infants were sufficient to show us this is not afeasible technique or solution'' to the infant organ shortage, saidDr. Joyce Peabody, Loma Linda's chief of neonatology.   Children's Hospital of Western Ontario, where Gabriel was born,put its program on hold in March. Two of the next threerespirator-sustained infants were not brain dead within therequired week. A 5-day-old girl's liver was sent to the UnitedStates but the recipient needed another transplant, said Dr.Timothy Frewen, director of pediatric critical care.   With such a low incidence of brain death, Frewen and otherdoctors wonder if the issue is worth pursuing. The CanadianPediatric Society plans to make a recommendation at its annualmeeting this month. A task force of five U.S. medical societiesexpects to publish a report this year.   The United Network for Organ Sharing's directors in Februarydeclined to impose a moratorium, but adopted a policy discouraginguse of anencephalic organs, at least until further study.   ``Society and the medical profession to some extent have learnedfollowing Baby Gabriel's experience,'' Frewen said. ``Withoutaccumulating experience, one can't say one way or another.''   Worldwide, 80 anencephalic infants have been accepted asprospective donors since the 1960s, said Dr. David Stumpf,professor of pediatrics and neurology at Northwestern Universityand coordinator of the U.S. task force. Forty-one became donors,providing 37 kidneys, two livers and three hearts; transplants weresuccessful in 11 kidney cases and one heart case, Paul's.   Of six such kidney transplants at Children's Hospital MedicalCenter in Cincinnati, only one recipient still has the originalanencephalic organs, said Dr. Paul McEnery, head of the kidneytransplant program.   That patient, Brian Bourgraf, now 25 and an assistant creditmanager for a Wilmington, Ohio, hardware manufacturer, received newkidneys in 1968.   ``If that person was here, as he's looking down, he's probablysaying, `I'm glad I did it,''' he said. ``His parents are more thanglad, because they've seen what's come out of it.''   Bourgraf frequently is cited by supporters of proposed Ohiolegislation to establish brain-death category solely foranencephalic infants that is based on their ability to breathewithout life-support systems. Similar measures have been consideredin New Jersey and California.   Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics atthe University of Minnesota, suspects ``a significant number'' ofparents would donate their anencephalic babies' organs if theycould.   Karen Schouten agrees. ``When you see a little baby like Paul itmakes it all worthwhile.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for June 8</NOTE></DOC>
