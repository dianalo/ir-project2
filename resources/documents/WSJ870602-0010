The strategy, first outlined in 1985 by Treasury Secretary James Baker, envisions three-way deals between the World Bank, commercial banks and debtor nations. Over roughly three years, the countries would agree, on a case-by-case basis, to adopt economic growth plans based on market-oriented reforms in place of state-run approaches and previous internationally imposed austerity programs. In return, the World Bank would make a total of $9 billion available in new loans to support the reforms and commercial banks would provide $20 billion in new money.    But last month's moves by Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. to add billions of dollars to bad-debt reserves, in effect admitting that some of their Third World loans might never be paid, has raised doubts about the Baker plan. Even before those moves, which have been followed by other major banks, new commercial bank lending had been slow in coming. And many financial analysts are assuming big U.S. banks will be loath to pour new funds into countries whose credit they have, in effect, conceded might already be bad.    The Treasury and the banks have strenuously protested this interpretation. Citicorp Chairman John Reed has expressed continuing support for the Baker plan and has said his bank expects to make further loans to debtor nations. Treasury officials insist that by insulating banks from the direst effects of loan write-offs, the increased reserves will encourage them to stay in the Third World lending game and to pursue &quot;innovative&quot; accords.    &quot;Citicorp reiterated its support (for the Baker plan),&quot; the treasury secretary said recently. &quot;Its enhanced reserves should enable it to respond more freely and fully to nations that are engaged in policies to achieve sustained growth.&quot;    To drive home its belief that the Baker plan is still viable, the Reagan administration says it expects the leaders of the seven industrial nations -- Japan, Italy, Great Britain, France, West Germany and Canada, in addition to the U.S. -- to reaffirm support for the plan at the Venice summit meeting next week. The summit communique's language may specifically note that the plan embraces the idea that new money from commercial banks needn't be solely in the form of loans, but could take the form of equity investments in the debtor nations, sometimes obtained in exchange for debt.    Since the Citicorp move, Treasury officials have been emphasizing this feature of the plan, which was added late last year. They have said repeatedly that banks could design &quot;a menu of options&quot; from which to pick ways to get more money to the debtors. By reiterating support for the equity approach, administration aides are echoing the views of Mr. Reed, who has said publicly that Citicorp would like to turn some of its debtor-nation loan portfolio into equity, even if the equity was worth only 80 cents on the dollar.    &quot;People are rushing to judgment in making the determination that this means the end of our debt strategy,&quot; said an administration official intimately involved in the debt plan. &quot;It does not.&quot; Referring to Citicorp's Mr. Reed, the official said, &quot;We are on the same wavelength. Those capital flows can come in the form of equity, or debt. (It's) better if they come as equity, because you don't pay interest on equity.&quot;    Furthermore, the administration believes big banks like Citicorp have invested too much in the Third World to just cut off the debtor countries. They contend that self-interest will guide the banks into making new loans or other money arrangements that will soon show that the plan is alive and well.    &quot;I predict that you're going to see additional lending by these banks,&quot; said the administration official. &quot;You're going to see that because they can't afford not to lend.&quot; Building up loan-loss reserves to cover some share of their outstanding Third World debt &quot;doesn't mean that they can afford to take a loss on the balance&quot; if lack of new funds keeps the debtor nations from growing, he argued.    The official predicted, for instance, that a new $2 billion loan-refinancing plan for Argentina, announced just before Citicorp disclosed its addition to reserves, would be completed despite the resistance of some smaller banks. Citicorp and Chase have agreed to take part in that refinancing.    Banks also may be encouraged to show at least some continuing support for the Baker plan because the leading political alternative is worse from their point of view. The major competing strategy in the political arena is a plan by Sen. Bill Bradley (D., N.J.), which would require banks, on a case-by-case basis, to negotiate specified amounts of debt forgiveness and interest-rate reductions with debtor countries.    Ironically, supporters of the Bradley approach also embrace debt-equity swaps, as envisioned by Citicorp's Mr. Reed. They contend that such deals would amount to an indirect form of the debt forgiveness the senator advocates because in practice the equity the banks would receive would have to be discounted in any resale.    Still, the Treasury's optimism isn't universally shared, even in the government. Some experts privately harbor fears that the fattened bank reserves may lead to defaults or write-offs antithetical to the Baker plan. &quot;I'm not quite sure why the Treasury is coming out and saying this is the greatest thing since sliced bread,&quot; said an economist elsewhere in the government. He worries that politicians in the debtor countries may just tell the banks &quot;now that you can take the hit of writing off these loans, we'll be glad to give you the chance.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
