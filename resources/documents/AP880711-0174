The United States, Britain and France are expected to use theirveto power as permanent council members to stop any censureresolution or demand that the U.S. fleet leave the Persian Gulf.   Requesting the debate is a turnabout for Iran, which hasboycotted council sessions for years because, it says, the15-nation body bows to pressure from Washington and is biasedagainst Iran in the 8-year-old war with Iraq.   It was not clear Monday whether a resolution would be presentedfor a vote. Iranian officials have said they seek condemnation ofthe United States and a demand that the U.S. Navy withdraw.   The White House announced Monday that President Reagan hasapproved U.S. compensation for the families of the 290 people whodied aboard the Iranian jet. Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said theamount of compensation had not yet been decided upon and thepayments could be subject to congressional approval.</TEXT><DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A vote tally released Monday gave thegovernment party's candidate for president a majority, but the slowcount fed rumors of party infighting and fraud.
