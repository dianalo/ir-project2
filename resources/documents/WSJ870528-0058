The move by Japan's largest construction company probably will pave the way for other investments in major U.S. firms by Japan's big builders, industry experts say. That's because the Japanese concerns, which have thus far pursued a U.S.market strategy of establishing their own subsidiaries rather than acquiring U.S. firms, are embroiled in mounting trade tension with U.S. builders. The U.S. companies have accused Japanese firms of unfair bidding practices and profiteering from an allegedly closed domestic market.    &quot;This is the one that everybody's been waiting for,&quot; said Charles T. Pinyan, chief editor of the newsletter International Construction Week. &quot;There will be others now that Shimizu has taken the first step.&quot;    Neither company would disclose terms of the acquisition. But Tadao Komatsu, president and chief executive officer of SCUS Inc., the New York-based Shimizu subsidiary that is buying the stake, said the Japanese-owned firm is providing minority financing for a management buyout of Dillingham Construction. A new company will be formed, he said, which will be majority-owned and managed by Dillingham's current management and retain the Dillingham name.    Mr. Komatsu said the two companies, which have cooperated on projects since the 1950s, will likely intensify their collaboration, particularly in the Pacific islands and Southeast Asia, where both firms have extensive operations. Dillingham Construction is a descendant of the defunct Dillingham Corp. of Hawaii, which accumulated large holdings in transportation, energy and real estate.    Dillingham Holdings, which went private in a 1983 leveraged buyout financed by the investment banking firm of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., has been trying to sell the construction unit for several months, a spokesman for the company confirmed.    &quot;We have experienced some of the same problems as the industry as a whole,&quot; said William Wilson, vice president, finance, of Dillingham Construction. &quot;We're not doing as well as we used to, or as well as we expect to in the future.&quot;    The construction industry has been hurt by a glut of new entrants, intensifying world-wide competition. Industry analysts noted that Dillingham Construction, which had 1986 revenue of $880 million, hasn't been profitable.    Analysts say Japan's construction firms have been searching for acquisition candidates in the U.S. as a hedge against American protectionism. Japanese builders' high-profile strategy of maintaining their own outposts in the U.S. has left Japan susceptible to U.S. criticism that Japan shelters its domestic industry at the expense of foreign competitors. Recently, for example, U.S. government and industry officials have accused Japan of virtually locking out non-Japanese construction companies from obtaining contracts to build a multibillion-dollar airport near Osaka, Japan.    Moreover, with the relative strength of the U.S. economy and the Third World's troubles, the U.S. is now a crucial market for builders, analysts point out. Mr. Pinyan of International Construction Week estimated that Japanese builders did $2.5 billion in American business last year, up from $1.8 billion in 1985.    Dillingham said it is the nation's 15th largest construction firm as ranked by Engineering News Record. Shimizu had 1986 revenue of $7 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
