<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-65-1031 </DOCNO><TEXT>As an SSC designer, who thinks of himself as a &quot;small physics&quot; worker,speaking to an audience consisting largely of similarly inclined physicists,the author has taken the liberty of reducing the subject of this talkfrom the advertised subject &quot;The Superconducting Super Collider&quot; to aless ambitious miscellany of small problems which have arisen duringthe design. The author attempts to show that accelerator physics is muchlike other physics and at least one example of the interplay betweenaccelerator physics and the physics of superconductivity. He quotes theresults which are due to his SSC colleagues, mainly at the Central designGroup and Fermilab.</TEXT></DOC>
