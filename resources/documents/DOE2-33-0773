Gratings are in-plane man-made microstructures whichhave been used as optic elements for most of this century. Joining ofthese two optical elements to form combined microstructure optics hasthe potential for greatly enhancing both the resolution and the throughputattainable in these spectral ranges. Experimental results for multilayergratings are presented and discussed. It will be demonstrated that multilayerdiffraction gratings act as x-ray prisms and are high efficiency dispersionelements. 9 refs., 5 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
