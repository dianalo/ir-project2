 Theyincluded fast 486-based personal systems, a new, smaller version of OS/2, a486-based portable, three new 386-based Model 80s, a new Model 65 and two55SX machines, as well as a new entry-level 286 workstation.andM;In the pages that follow, we bring you:andM;* Full launch details, plus analysis of every machine and piece of softwareannounced on the dayandM;* Unique, hands-on reviews of the two new 486 machines that count--the Model90 and the Model 95andM;* OS/2 1.3 -- it looks just the same, but it's smaller, faster and includesAdobe Type Manager font technologyandM;* XGA -- what it is and how it worksandM;* Plus, intriguing speculation about the machines and technology that didn'tmake it into the announcement.andM;The machines trotted out for IBM's 1990 autumn extravaganza were solid,uninspiring products that build on well-established technology.andP;  Indeed,there were so few surprises that many observers -- PC User included -- mustbe wondering why IBM didn't choose to ship this stuff months ago.andP;  Don'tforget that Apricot first previewed a 486-based MCA machine 18 months ago andCompaq has been moving 486s for about a year.andM;The delay partly confirms IBM's grave difficulty in making a gargantuan userbase progress at anything other than one notch at a time, and also that themill of IBM's Randamp;D grinds slow.andM;On the other hand, it's difficult to believe that the world's biggestcomputer company needs to be quite this tardy in bringing its customers thepower they've been so vociferously demanding.andM;IBM's argument has always been that the 486 market has -- until now -- beensmall and populated by expensive machines.andP;  Instead, the company has stuckwith the lucrative 386 market where, for example, its SX machine is a topseller.andP;  Now IBM believes that it can pitch 486 machines at a price thatallows it to sell a lot of them.andM;This time the software was about as important as the new hardware.andP;  A newlean and mean version of OS/2 made its appearance.andP;  Version 1.3 is what 1.2should have been (see Editorial, issue 145), and there's even an assist givento Windows 3.0 application developers in the shape of the Software MigrationKit which enables them to move programs to Presentation Manager with just arecompile.andM;Novell was invited to share the limelight, and all of IBM's new kit isNetWare 386 v 3.1 certified.andP;  The Santa Cruz Operation was also on hand todemonstrate Open Desktop under SCO Unix 3.i.andP;  OSF/1 and IBM's own AIX, on theother hand, were conspicuous by their absence.andP;  The IBM documents I saw onlylisted an 'intent' to supply AIX in the future.andM;The Model 90 desktop, the Model 95 tower and the Model P75 luggable draw mostof their technology from the Model 70,80 and P70--products which have beenaround, in the main, since 1987 to 1988.andM;In addition, the Micro Channel Architecture implementations received aninjection of RS/6000 technology to bring it up to the level of equipment thatCompaq has been shipping for the last year.andM;A number of rumoured enhancements didn't make it into the machines asannounced.andP;  IBM has been romancing a 2.88Mb 3-1/2-inch floppy disk dirve forsome time (presumably the same one that made its debut in the new NeXTmachines last month), but it didn't make the current release.andP;  Insiderspredict that it will come out in the spring.andP;  IBM's new 3-1/2-inch ANSIstandard 500Mb optical read-write disk with a 60ms average access time didn'tmake the party, either.andM;While the new PS/2s have a new memory architecture that should make theaddition of more processors a doddle, the rumoured additionalprocessor/memory slot (similar to the Compaq SystemPro) wasn't included.andP;  Infairness, without an operating system to accommodate the additionalprocessor, it would be a wasted feature, as it was for most of the first yearof the SystemPro's existence.andP;  We suspect that when AIX for the PS/2 supportsmore than one processor -- through MPX -- the Model 100 will be born.andM;It's apparent that IBM has a tricky job ahead of it, namely protecting theAS/400 line from both the PS/2 and the RS/6000.andP;  Guarding the mid-rangerevenue is easier with the PS/2 by omitting mass storage features, diskmirroring, disk striping and other minicomputer esoterica, as found in theSystemPro and dell's new tower.andP;  Even so, with the availability of Baby/36for developing full-blown RPG II applications, the Model 90 and 95 will wreakhavoc on the already depressing UK AS/400 sales.andM;Another 'missing' development was a colour LCD on the luggable P75.andP;  Toshibais said to be ready to launch the screen that was developed in conjunctionwith IBM, but the world's biggest computer company has demured on thisoccasion.andP;  Informed speculation says it's being saved for a Comdex launch inthe company of the long-awaited 2-1/2lb IBM notebook PC.andM;If the IBM autumn fashion parade seems a little flat, it may be because thebulk of the offering was set for launch a year ago.andP;  In the wake left by theCompaq EISA/486/SystemPro roll-out, IBM is said to have cancelled its lessflashy showing.andP;  Even with the subsequent addition of the 33MHz 486 (Compaqpre-announced its own last November), the fast SCSI devices, OS/2 1.3 andXGA, the line-up fails to have a great deal of impact.andM;For a full run-down on all the PS/2-related announcements, check out theCorporate Summary box that appears on page 58.andM;PS/2 Model 90andM;The three new Model 90s are pitched at everyone who wanted more than a Model70 but less than a floor-standing Model 80.andP;  In several 'power' dimensions,the Model 90 delivers much more than its desktop predecessor.andM;In terms of processor power, the low-end Model 90 -- the AK9 -- is equivalentto the Model 70 Riu with a 25MHz i486.andP;  The faster Model 90 AKD and AJ9 bothsport Intel's latest 32-bit fashion piece, the 33 MHz 486.andP;  Like the Model70, the Model 90 offers the Power Platform 'brains on a board' approach whichisn't new to computing but comparatively new to IBM's PC line-up.andM;The Power Platform has now given way at the high end to the 'ProcessorComplex'.andP;  There's a special slot built into the Model 90 that will allow thesubstition of processor complexes and allow you to increase the performancefrom the 25MHz 486 to the 33MHz -- and presumably to faster 486 chips, oncethey're available from Intel.andP;  The story is familiar to the already told byNCR, wyse, Olivetti, ALR and Compaq -- it's about protecting customers'investment.andM;So the concept of the Processor Complex is identical to that of the PowerPlatform, although its implementation is different.andP;  Crucially, the newversion has a 64-bit path into system memory as opposed to a 32-bit path.andM;The question of why IBM isn't offering a 25MHz 386 processor complex to giveusers with lower processor power requirements access to some of the othergoodies in the Model 90 range is an open one, however.andM;While 486s have an internal 8Kb cache which is sufficient for some uses,there are demonstrated performance advantage to providing a little somethingextra on the side.andP;  The Model 90s (and indeed the 95s) can take a plug-inoptional cache of 256Kb for those operating environments (like Unix) wherethe cost can be justified.andP;  This means that user who just need a fast DOSmachine are spared considerable expense.andM;The pathway between the processor and system memory is 64 bits wide, whichshould eliminate some bottlenecks.andM;If there's a dissapointment with the Model 90, it comes in the adaptor carddepartment.andP;  The case is only slightly talleR, at 14cm, than that of theModel 70.andP;  This means that the new MCA adapttor cards, which first surfacedin the RS/6000, won't ever make it into the Model 90.andP;  All the slots are32-bit slots, but there are still only three useable ones.andP;  A fourth slot isoccupied by the hard disk controller card.andP;  One frequently heard criticism ofthe Model 70 (also with three slots) was that it wasn't physically capaciousenough.andM;At least the Model 90 won't need any MCA resources for memory.andP;  All threemodels come with 8Mb memory as standard and a maximum of 32Mb can be slotteddirectly into the motherboard.andP;  The memory is interleaved and can use mixed70, 80 and 85ns SIMMs.andP;  When 8Mb SIMMs become available (double-sided 4Mbones), you'll be able to get double the 32Mb figure without resorting to theexpansion bus.andM;Additionally, the presence of interleaved memory ensures that the 486 doesn'tget locked out of memory by other busmaster cards.andP;  Instead, it nips inthrough 'electronic gaps' lfet by busmasters to snatch the information itneeds.andP;  In use, it's simply much faster than non-interleaved memory.andM;For a desktop machine, drive expansion is highly satisfactory.andP;  You canchoose from 60, 80, 120, 160 and 320Mb drives -- although only the last twoare standard.andP;  The 25MHz 486-powered Model 90 AJ9 has the 16ms average accesstime 160Mb drive, while the 33MHz 486 Model 90 AK9 and AKD have 160Mb and320Mb drives, with respective access times of 16ms and 12.5ms.andP;  Both driveshave a 1:1 interleave.andP;  The new 400Mb 3-1/2-inch hard disk that appears inthe portable P75 isn't yet available on the desktop (or deskside, for thatmatter).andP;  Still, a roughly AT-sized desktop box that can hold nearly 1Gb isnothing to be sneezed at.andM;At last there's desktop PS/2 that can access data and programs stored on5-1/2-inch floppy disks withouth having to use an external device.andP;  And withspace in the case for 5-1/4-inch format drives, you could conceivably fit oneof IBM's SCSI CD-ROMs, a DC600 tape backup unit or a host of other devicesthat have always had to be tied to a desktop PS/2 with an umbilical cord inthe past.andM;SCSI is now IBM's drive interface of choice and the Model 90s are fitted withIBM's best shot at accelerating the decent physical access times posted bythe 160Mb and 320Mb drives.andP;  The SCSI adaptor has a 32-bit data path and abusmaster to orchestrate the I/O proceedings.andP;  IBM has included a 512Kb cacheto complement the 64Kb read-ahead buffer.andM;Perhaps more important than raw speed is that the provision of SCSI letsadditional devices, such as tape drives, scanners, printers and otherperipherals, be attached without the need for additional interface cards.andO;It's possible to attach seven devices to a single SCSI card and you can fitthree in here if you need lots of drives.andP;  SCSI comes into its own inmulti-tasking and multi-user environments -- which are likely territories forthe Model 90 and 95.andM;Both standard drives used in the Model 90 can take advantage of synchronousSCSI.andP;  The bigger drive can transfer data from the media to the buffer at 2Mbper second (Mbps) while the smaller manages 1.5Mbps.andP;  The data rates from thebuffer to the SCSI bus are 4 and 5Mbps, respectively.andM;Making its debut in the Model 90 is a new graphics standard, XGA.andP;  TheeXtended Graphics Array is integrated on the motherboard of the Model 90 andP75 but offeredas an MCA adaptor for use in the Model 95 and other 32-bit MCAmachines.andM;IBM maintains that XGA is optimised for graphical user interfaces likeWindows, Presentation Manager and the X.Window System.andP;  Scissoring, bitblitting and accelerated line drawing make XGA faster in graphics mode.andP;  Ithas a full 32-bit busmaster interface and is backwards-compatible with VGAand the 8514/A standards.andM;XGA provides 1024x768 resolution with 256 colours, and there's a directcolour mode that can put 64,000 different colours on screen in VGA resolutionfor what IBM terms &quot;near-photographic realism&quot;.andP;  Drivers are provided forWindows 3.0, PM and AutoCAD as standard, and even outside of straightgraphics applications, the text quality is excellent.andM;The new PS/2s have their BIOS code stored in a portected partition on thehard disk.andP;  While this allows easy updates of the code normally stored inROMs, it may also be a 'feature' that'll keep you close to IBM when it's timeto upgrade your hard disk.andM;This choice appears more odd when you reflect that along with the keyboardthe most unreliable part of a PC is the hard disk -- and even IBM drives havefeet of clay.andP;  Why IBM didn't go with Flash EPROMs like Olivetti's CP486 andhave the same software upgradability remains a mystery.andP;  Perhaps it's amarketing mystery.andM;And here's something to remember.andP;  The only other unreliable part of acomputer system besides the hard disk is the user.andP;  Is the BIOS reallyprotected from an ill-considered FDISK or low-level format?andM;The serial and parallel ports at the back appear unchanged from the Model 70,but inside there's all new gubbins.andP;  If you undo two screws at the back thecover can be lifted off.andP;  What's underneath is basically the same motherboardarrangement as the floor-standing Model 95, except that the power supply issmaller and the system memory -- 8Mb in the review model -- is housed on twodaughterboards which stand upright in a plastic cradle between the powersupply and the 64-bit processor complex slot.andM;Four slots remain.andP;  One holds an identical busmaster SCSI host adaptor tothat in the Model 95.andP;  The XGA is on the motherboard this time, so there arethree free 32-bit slots, one with a video extension.andM;There are inevitably more limited drive options than the floor-standing Model95.andP;  Basically, you get four drive bays which are all half-height with noprovision for any full-height drives.andP;  There are two 3-1/2-inch drive bays,one above the other, in the middle of the fron fascia.andP;  The top bay held a3-1/2-inch floppy disk drive.andP;  Then there are two more half-height bays onthe right.andP;  The lower right-hand bay held a 160Mb hard disk.andM;The upper right-hand bay can take either a 3-1/2-inch form factor or a5-1/4-inch form factor drive so, for example, a 1.2Mb floppy disk drive orCD-ROM drive can be fitted.andM;On the left-hand side at the front there's a conventional square fan boxbehind the power switch.andP;  There's no LED panel, just a power LED and HDaccess LED.andM;PS/2 Model 95andM;The crown of the PS/2 range now sits firmly on the Model 95.andP;  IT's not just aModel 80 with a new processor -- rather, the whole system been revamped.andM;The box is entirely different.andP;  It's shorter and fatter and looks more stableon its feet that the rather tall, think Model 80.andP;  Its reduced height makesit a bit less convenient to operate from a seated position.andP;  The on/offswitch is now a button and there's an LED screen which monitors status.andM;The control panel and LED display are housed in the top bay.andP;  The LED displaywas incorporated when IBM engineers first started working on the Model 95 andthought it might have been left in a cupboard as a fileserver which didn'tneed a display.andM;Later, it seems they decided to make a display monitor an optional feature,so the LED was retained, but it isn't over-used.andP;  IT shows some codes whenthe machine is powered up and it also displays error messages.andP;  For example,the '165 -- configuration error' message which shows up on the display whenyou change out a card also appears on the LED as '0001 6500'.andM;The Model 95 supplies the slots and drive bays that won't fit in a Model 90.andO;To get inside, you simply pull the plastic front cover towards you, whichreleases the right-hand side cover.andP;  All of this comes off without tools --so it's farewell to the 5cp coin you used to need in order to get inside aModel 80.andM;With the right-hand cover off you can see the way the drive bays stack up anddown the front of the casing from the bottom to within a few inches of thetop.andP;  Underneath the control panel bay there are two external drive bays.andO;They can only take a 3-1/2-inch form factor drive, and on the review machine,the top bay held a single 1.44Mb floppy disk drive.andP;  The third bay from thetop, however, can take 3-1/2-inch or 5-1/4-inch form factor drives -- this,says IBM, has been requested by its customers -- and could be used for a1.2Mb floppy disk drive, CD-ROM drive, tape streamer, or a SCSI hard disk.andM;After that there are four half-height drive bays for SCSI hard disks.andO;Alternatively, the same four bays could be used as two full-height bays orone full-height and two half-height.andP;  It's possible to squeeze a total offive hard disk drives into a Model 95 if they're all half-height.andP;  That givesa theoretical maximum of 1.5Gb (five times 320Mb SCSI drives).andM;If that's not enough for you, there's now a matching PS/2 External StorageEnclosure which will hold six additional SCSI hard disks and extend thesystem capacity a further 2Gb.andM;The floor-standing Model 95 had a 160Mb hard disk mounted in the lower halfof the full-height drive bay.andM;The Model 95 is obviously designed to be easily upgradeable.andP;  With theexception of the bottom bay, all of the others have plastic trays which slideout when a second level front cover is removed.andM;Each tray holds a power cable ready to be used to connect the drive, and thedata cable for the drives is already in place.andP;  It feeds from the SCSI hostadaptor along the top of the casing and is held in place by metal tags whichform part of the casing.andP;  The power supply is about the size of twohouse-bricks and sits at the lower rear behind the drive bays.andP;  It takes up abit more than a quarter of the internal space -- it's massive 329W unit.andO;This is a very neat and tidy machine.andM;Adding a hard disk involves simply removing the first front cover, theright-hand side cover, the second-level front cover, and sliding out theplastic drive tray.andP;  Drop the drive into the tray, attach a power cable,slide it back in, connect the power cable to the PSU lead and clip in theSCSI connector.andP;  You don't need any tools, and it'll take five minutes ifyou're slow.andP;  This is the kind of snap-in construction that support groupslove.andM;The issue of having to have a reference disk has been smoothed out as well.andO;Each machine now comes with reference files and BIOS installed on a protectedarea of the hard disk.andP;  So you need keep only a separate reference disk as abackup.andP;  If, for example, you have to change hard disk drives, you can thenre-install the reference material and the BIOS using an IBM utility calledRestore.andP;  The reference material is safe from an ordinary accidental DOSformat, and IBM technical staff believe that even a low-level format won't beable to get at the information.andM;There are six free 32-bit slots and two of them have the video extension,presaging some pretty high-performance video adaptors that can talk acrossthe Micro Channel.andP;  Also, because the unit is a tower and isn't constrainedby restrictions on comfortable monitor height, the Model 95 can use thetaller second-generation MCA cards from the RS/6000.andM;If you unscrew a lever on the power supply, you can swing it out of thecasing on a hinge attached to the bottom rail.andP;  That reveals the memorySIMMS, two banks of four rows, with eight rows in all.andP;  The memory isinterleaved, and half of the eight rows were filled to give our reviewmachine its standard 8Mb of very fast 70ns RAM.andM;The machine's motherboard is attached to the left-hand side casing.andP;  It'sabout 1 inch short of the full height of the system box and about two-thirdsof the depth from back to front.andP;  It looked nearly empty and had only a fewlast minute patch wires on it.andM;The motherboard holds nine slots.andP;  The lowest, just above the power supply isthe long 64-bit processor complex slot incorporating a 25MHz Intel i486 andIBM stickered and stamped VLSI chipsets.andP;  The remaining eight slots provide32-bit expansion (two have the video graphics extension).andP;  Of the eight, sixare free slots and two are taken by the XGA card and the busmaster SCSI hostadaptor.andM;The SCSI busmaster sits in the uppermost slot underneath the top casing.andP;  Ithas 512Kb cache memory plugged into it, and an external connector which had aSCSI terminator attached.andM;The inclusion of a cached controller is a bit of a puzzle in both the Model90 and 95.andP;  Benchmarks show that a cacheing controller, like the DPTSmartCache, is a big help under single-tasking, single-user DOS, and the topof the PC User benchmark chart is littered with examples of this provenmethod of boosting DOS disk performance.andM;However, in LAN and Unix environments where the disk accesses are likely tobe anything but sequential, a disk cache can actually interfere withperformance.andP;  Both Unix and LAN Manager hook onto chunks of system RAM to useas an I/O cache and there can be problems co-ordinating the cache on thecontroller with the operating system controlled cache.andP;  A full study of thisissue -- and many others -- will be undertaken when IBM makes a fullyspecified Model 95 available to PC User.andM;The XGA board sits in slot number five (one of the two with a videoextension) and provides 1024x768 resolution with 256 colours.andP;  Thanks to theLED control panel you can run the Model 95 as a fileserver in cupboardwithout a display or an XGA card.andP;  Alternatively, you can plug in an XGA anda display.andM;With all that mass storage whirring around, backup should be an obsession.andO;IBM has provided the only sane alternative in a 2.3Gb DAT tape unit thattakes up the full-height bay, decreasing total drive room by two drives inthe process.andM;The tape drive has a SCSI interface and it comes equipped with utilities tohandle both FAT and HPFS file systems.andP;  The drive is supplied with an OS/2version of the ubiquitous SYTOS tape software.andP;  The data transfer rate of thedrive is 245Kbps, from which you can calculate that a full tape can begenerated in about 2-1/2 hours.andP;  Incremental backups might be a less numbingoption.andP;  Otherwise, the Model 95 is internally the same as the Model 90.andP;  Theprocessor complex options are the same: two flavours of i486.andP;  In Multi-usermode, the optional 256Kb processor cache is almost mandatory.andM;Unix users (who perhaps aren't AIX users) will bemoan the lack of a secondprocessor slot.andP;  In Unix, horsepower equals more users or better performancefor more users, and in this regard, the SystemPro still looks like thesuperior solution for departmental computing at the high end.andP;  Roll onMultiProcessor Extensions for MCA.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
