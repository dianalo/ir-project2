Yang (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> EXE CNG </G><DATELINE> ATLANTA  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, in an address that saluted the delegates to the Democratic National Convention, ignited them into cheers and then stirred them into tearful silence, toasted Gov. Michael Dukakis and urged the party to address the &quot;high moral challenges of our day.&quot;    Mr. Jackson, the civil-rights leader who transformed his campaign from a symbol of protest into a formidable political force in 1988, said his rival, though tired and tried, &quot;always resisted the temptation to stoop to demagoguery.&quot;    Mr. Jackson didn't formally endorse the Massachusetts governor -- he has long regarded the act of having his name placed into nomination tonight an important episode in the American story -- but he appealed for party unity, saying, &quot;When we divide we cannot win.&quot; And he described his rival as a man with &quot;a good mind fast at work, with steel nerves, guiding his campaign out of the crowded field without appeal to the worst of us.&quot;    In a speech that was delivered only a few miles from Martin Luther King's burial ground and that touched even the most devout of Mr. Dukakis's supporters, Mr. Jackson bowed to the civil-rights pioneers of the past and said &quot;their prayers are being answered, their work was not in vain, and hope is eternal.&quot; And, in seeking to establish a new political &quot;common ground&quot; for his often fractious party, he called on Democrats to seek &quot;a new day and a new direction.&quot;    Many of the themes and much of the language were plucked from Mr. Jackson's five-year-old campaign repertoire, but seldom have the parables and the prophecies reached so deeply and so poignantly into a prime-time audience. The common threads stitched through the speech were struggle, faith -- and hope.    He exhorted: &quot;Keep hope alive. Keep hope alive. Keep hope alive.&quot;    Before Mr. Jackson mounted the platform, was faced with a panorama of red Jackson signs and seized emotional control of the evening, the Dukakis forces prevailed on all the major platform issues, consolidated their grip on the convention and turned their attention to the general-election battle with the Republicans.    Tonight the delegates will officially nominate Gov. Dukakis, with Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas expected to coast to an easy victory tomorrow night and become the Democrats' vice-presidential nominee. Both men are to speak tomorrow night during peak television viewing hours.    Though delegates and elected officials stressed unity at the convention and in the autumn campaign, questions remain about the durability of the armistice between Mr. Dukakis and Mr. Jackson. Moreover, the acrimony of the first few days of the convention left some scars on the Democrats.    An ABC News/Washington Post poll showed Vice President George Bush holding a thin 46%-45% lead, reversing a six-point lead that the Massachusetts governor held just 10 days ago. A Darden Poll of the South showed Mr. Bush with a 48%-43% lead in that region after trailing by three percentage points four weeks ago.    At the same time, Mr. Dukakis's efforts to make inroads into the Jackson constituency inspired little enthusiasm. With his designated running mate, Sen. Bentsen, Mr. Dukakis traveled to the Martin Luther King Center for Nonviolent Social Change and was greeted by an embarrassingly sparse audience that was mostly white.    And the efforts to meld the campaign staffs of Mr. Dukakis and Mr. Jackson -- a key element of the agreement struck Monday to ease tensions between the camps and pave the way for a smooth convention -- proceeded haltingly and, at times, awkwardly. There remains a good deal of uncertainty about how the integration will proceed.    &quot;I just figured out what my new job will be -- referee,&quot; said Donna Brazile, a black Dukakis aide who worked on Mr. Jackson's 1984 presidential campaign and who retains ties to the Jackson camp.    Despite these problems, the party emerges from the first two days of its convention in reasonably good shape. The ABC/Post poll was taken on Sunday, when the Jackson-Dukakis dispute was in full flare. The surveys for the Darden poll were conducted in the week preceding the convention and covered Mr. Dukakis's weakest region -- a nine-state area that Ronald Reagan carried by a 62%-38% margin in 1984; if Mr. Bush doesn't improve his 48%-43% lead in the South, he'll probably lose the election.    A positive image of the party also emerged from phone calls being made for The Wall Street Journal by Peter Hart Research Associates, which each night has been calling more than 50 people who have been watching the convention. This sample, though too small to be representative, nonetheless gives a broad, though slightly Democratic, glimpse into the reception the convention is being given across the U.S.    &quot;Dukakis is in the driver's seat,&quot; said Mike Garrett of Bridgeport, Conn., who works in a defense plant. &quot;I'm very impressed with his communications skills.&quot; Nora Turner, a retiree from Baltimore, said: &quot;I liked Dukakis and Jackson.&quot; There were some complaints about how Mr. Jackson was being treated by the party and Mr. Dukakis and about the prominent role Mr. Jackson had assumed.    In their parade of speeches last night, the Democrats didn't dwell on the policies of Mr. Reagan -- they calculate there's little advantage in criticizing a popular president whose name won't be on the ballot -- but turned their fire on Mr. Bush.    House Majority Whip Tony Coelho of California asked in his remarks, &quot;When the going got tough, where was George Bush?&quot; And Texas agriculture commissioner Jim Hightower called Mr. Bush &quot;a toothache of a man.&quot;    The platform the Democrats approved last night is a broadly worded document of about 4,500 words, a little more than one-tenth the length of either the 1984 or 1980 versions. It skirts specifics and painstakingly avoids giving Mr. Bush and the Republicans any openings for the fall campaign. Rather than using the word abortion, for instance, the platform speaks of &quot;the fundamental right of reproductive choice.&quot;    The Dukakis camp dismissed the notion that it acceded to adjustments in the platform in exchange for assurances from Mr. Jackson that his forces would work for a smooth convention. &quot;This process has not been about deals but finding common ground,&quot; said Christopher Edley, the Dukakis issues director. &quot;There's nothing in this platform that Michael Dukakis disagrees with.&quot;    The document pledges to restore &quot;competence, caring and incorruptibility&quot; to the government. It never mentions the Republicans, President Reagan or Vice President Bush by name, but derides &quot;voodoo economics&quot; and &quot;'trickle down' policies&quot; and refers to the Iran-Contra affair.    To combat Republican attacks on Mr. Dukakis's criminal-justice record in Massachusetts, it promises increased federal aid to local police, a ban on &quot;cop-killer&quot; bullets and the creation of a national drug &quot;czar.&quot;    On defense, the party pledges to make the country &quot;militarily stronger in our overall defense and anti-terrorist capabilities&quot; and to seek &quot;mutual, verifiable and enforceable agreements that will make significant reductions in strategic weapons.&quot;    The Dukakis and Jackson campaigns had reached agreement on platform issues early last week, but carrying it out was delayed in the wake of the conflict over Mr. Dukakis's handling of the vice presidency.    The convention, by an overwhelming margin, rejected a call for higher taxes for corporations and wealthy individuals. Language supporting &quot;self-determination for Israelis and Palestinians&quot; in the Middle East was taken up for a rancorous debate, but was withdrawn without a vote.    The Dukakis forces easily prevailed over Mr. Jackson's efforts to push the party to the left by placing in the platform a pledge not to be the first to use nuclear weapons. It has long been U.S. and NATO policy not to rule out the first use of nuclear arms in the event of a Soviet invasion of Western Europe.    The Dukakis and Jackson camps compromised on language on education and child care, pledging more spending for those programs without attaching specific price tags. Mr. Jackson had sought a commitment to double federal education spending.    The settlement was reached after consultation with the National Education Association, which supports Mr. Dukakis but backed the Jackson language. &quot;It is a clear signal that education is priority,&quot; said NEA President Mary Futrell. &quot;We understand the political problems of attaching specifics to the platform.&quot;    In contrast to past conventions, the platform debate demonstrated a new willingness by traditional liberal constituencies to avoid specific promises that might encumber the party nominee in the fall.    &quot;Details and platforms don't go together,&quot; said David Cohen, a liberal armscontrol lobbyist. &quot;You don't focus in on a single slice of an issue.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
