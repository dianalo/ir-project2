HughesStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/01/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> TGR LABORAIRLINES (AIR)TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN><DATELINE> LOS ANGELES  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The pilots of the Flying Tiger Line air cargo unit of Tiger International Inc. accepted a 3 1/2-year package of wage and benefit concessions that includes a 25% pay cut.    The terms of the agreement with the pilots union weren't disclosed when the company announced it Thursday. The agreement is expected to save the company at least $37 million a year.    As previously reported, the agreement makes it likely that the company will drop previously announced plans to sell the assets of the ailing unit.    Industry sources said the pilots also accepted a two-tier wage scale under which newly hired pilots will be paid at lower rates. The pilots also gave up $8.4 million a year in supplemental pension benefits and $10 million a year in other benefits, according to the sources.    The pilots' average annual salary will be reduced to $87,750 from $117,000, for an indicated first-year savings to the company of $19 million.    In return for the concessions, the company said it will allow pilots to share in the unit's profits and will grant employees one seat on the unit's board, increasing board membership to 11. The agreement is effective today.    The company has indicated it will request wage cuts from all other employee groups, including those represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. Flying Tiger employs a total of 6,675, including 650 pilots.    The company's competitive position has been hurt by a recent increase in trans-Pacific air-cargo service by other companies. Tiger International reported a loss of $55.5 million in the latest nine months on revenue of $811.1 million.    The company has said labor-cost reductions are the first of three steps needed to keep the airline flying. The other two are restructuring a large portion of the company's debt of $550 million and devising a more competitive marketing program. </TEXT></DOC>
