A spokesman for Christian army commander Michel Aoun said Syriangunners were shelling his forces' positions in hills around themountain town of Souk el-Gharb as well as in Beirut's Christiansuburbs of Kfarshima and Hadath.   He said the Syrians were shelling from positions in the villageof Aitat, opposite Souk el-Gharb, and from the suburb of Choueifat.   The spokesman accused the Syrians of starting the barrage as ArabLeague Assistant Secretary General Lakhdar Ibrahimi crossed Beirut'sdividing Green Line for talks with Gen. Aoun and other Christianleaders in east Beirut.   ``They shelled us with tank cannons and recoilless rifles. We areresponding in kind,'' said the spokesman on condition of anonymity.   He accused the Syrians of provoking the fighting to ``foilefforts by Arab leaders to work out a solid cease-fire.''   Shortly before dawn, Syrian howitzer batteries deployed in Moslemwest Beirut fired 20 shells at the coastline north of the city in anapparent effort to maintain a blockade of Christian ports.   Police said the 130mm shells exploded around the ports of Byblosand Jounieh. No casualties were reported.   The renewed shelling after a two-day lull contrasted sharply withreports in Lebanese media that a cease-fire agreement had beenworked out by Ibrahimi in Damascus, the Syrian capital.   The pro-Syrian daily paper As-Safir reported in its main storytoday that ``an air of optimism prevails over the situation in lightof Ibrahimi's talks.''   Ibrahimi arrived in west Beirut from Damascus on Monday. He heldtalks in the city's Moslem sector with Salim Hoss, Aoun's rival ashead of the Moslem cabinet in Lebanon's dual government.   In Damascus, Ibrahimi met over the weekend with President HafezAssad and his foreign minister, Farouk al-Sharaa.   Syria has 40,000 troops in predominantly Moslem sectors ofLebanon extending from the northern Akkar plain across the easternBekaa valley to west and south Beirut.   The official Syrian news agency, SANA, quoted al-Sharaa as sayingthe Damascus talks centered on ``the need for the warring Lebanesefactions to reach agreement on the mechanism for lifting blockades,reopening crossing points and making the cease-fire comprehensive.''   The current round of violence broke out March 8, two days afterAoun blockaded illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias south ofBeirut in order to salvage lost customs dues of around $100 millionannually.   The Syrians and their Moslem militia allies retaliated byblockading the 310-square-mile Christian enclave northeast of thecapital that is home to 1 million Christians.   At least 367 people have been killed and 1,432 wounded in theconfrontation, by police count.   Aoun has agreed to previous Arab calls that he should lift theblockade. The Syrians, however, have refused to call off their siegeof the Christian enclave to prevent Aoun from obtainingIraqi-shipped war materiel.</TEXT></DOC>
