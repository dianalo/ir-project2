 There are too many different applications and toomany products and people addressing each of the segments and niches to beable to discuss them all, even briefly.andP;  Thus, our comments here will belimited to summarizing new developments in a few key areas: page composition,word processing, other aids to text processing, graphics and a fewmiscellaneous topics.andP;  OCR software, which ordinarily would fit in a sectionof this nature, appears later because the software itself is intertwined withhardware (scanners).andM;Conference sessions.andP;  Most of this section covers developments at the SeyboldExposition.andP;  However, we have included also some notes from a couple ofConference sessions that focused on applications: one on the newspaper andmagazine market and one on advertising and marketing.andP;  Those sessionscentered on case studies of users building systems to handle theseapplications.andM;Although it has been clear for some time that the desktop publishingcomposition market has matured--and that radical new developments won't beforthcoming--there continues to be activity in the area of porting softwareto new platforms.andP;  Evidence of that was Quark's preview of Xpress for the PC,which is far from ready for deliveries but bodes well for the future.andM;Among new products, Elan drew a good response to its Avalon Publisher programfor the Sun workstation.andM;As usual, some vendors brought products that didn't have significantenhancements, so we won't include a story about them at this time.andP;  In thiscategory are Island Graphics, Letraset and Timeworks.andP;  In addition, manyvendors of higher-end products have been reviewed recently in the SeyboldReport on Publishing Systems (Interleaf, Frame, Magna, Bestinfo, Penta,Intergraph, Atex, etc.).andM;Aldus shows PageMaker 4 for Windows 3andM;Version 4.0 of PageMaker for Windows 3.0 was shown at a press conference, butAldus's chairman, Paul Brainerd, couldn't get a commitment from the engineerson a release date.andP;  &quot;It's very close,&quot; one said.andP;  (Maybe the announcement ofQuark Xpress on the PC will expedite it.)andM;The Windows 3.0 version will be functionally the same as the Mac version (seeVol.andP;  4, No.andP;  7).andP;  However, this release will bring the color capabilities ofMac PageMaker to PC users for the first time.andM;Expect to wait a while for the OS/2 and Next versions.andP;  For power users, weanticipate OS/2 PageMaker 4.0 running on a fast '386 with enough RAM and aSuperVGA monitor to be a remarkable desktop tool.andM;Free PrePrint to Service Bureaus.andP;  Imagesetter service bureaus and colorprepress houses can get a complimentary copy of Aldus's desktop colorseparation utility for the Mac, PrePrint, by returning a marketing researchquestionnaire.andP;  PageMaker 4.0 virtually requires PrePrint for outputtingcolor separations.andP;  The deadline is December 21, 1990.andP;  Contact AldusCustomer Relations at (206) 628-2320.andM;Applix's Alis: office toolandM;Many people want a system that integrates all their office computing needsinto one unified bundle.andP;  In the personal computing world, these people mightbuy microsoft Works, which gives them word processing, a spreadsheet andchart facility, drawing tools and a database manager.andP;  Mac users might alsolook to Ragtime (see below).andM;None of these functions, viewed in isolation, is as good as a standaloneprogram.andP;  But taken together, they do most of what people spend most of theirtime doing.andP;  Works gives them a common look and feel for all modules, and itcosts lots less than buying a standalone program for each function.andM;In the Unix world, these people would buy Applix's Alis.andP;  It includes:andM;* A good word processor featuring multiple levels of undo, change bars andcolored text, a built-in spelling checker and thesaurus, auto generation ofindexes and tables of contents, widow/orphan control, footnotes andend-notes, lots of fonts and sizes, and so on.andM;* A good draw/paint program with a pixel editor for touching up scannedimages, object drawing tools, a user-defined parts library and so on.andM;* A good spreadsheet with macros, intersheet references, hidable columns androws, named cell ranges, formula comments, goal seeking, lots of fonts andsizes, and so on.andP;  Data from spreadsheets can be passed to the drawing modulefor creating charts.andM;* A good personal database manager with query by example, merge print andmail merge functions and undo.andP;  It holds up to 8,000 records with up to foursort keys.andM;As with Microsoft Works, each of these components could be beaten by a decentstandalone program.andP;  But in the Unix world, you also get networking.andP;  Alisuses the network to provide:andM;* Electronic mail with multiple addressing, blind copies, return-receipt andurgent messages, an interface to other Unix systems and a voice-annotationcapability.andM;* Calendar and schedule handling, allowing access to other users' calendarsand a meeting scheduler along with the usual to-do list.andM;* Shared filing with access control, document retrieval by keywords or headerfields, signatures for revision control and a shared bulletin board.andM;While Alis's text composition and graphics handling are not up to thestandards of a desktop publishing system, the integration of those otherfacilities makes it a real option in offices where publishing is only a tinypart of the workload.andM;Elan in Sun fray with AvalonandM;A new challenger has joined the battle for the corporate publishing marketusing Sun workstations: Elan Computer Group, of Mountain View, California.andO;Although this market seems crowded already--with Frame, Interleaf and IslandGraphics well entrenched--Elan believes there is room for a Unix system thatis easier to use than Frame's and Interleaf's.andP;  It calls its product AvalonPublisher.andM;Elan itself isn't a new company.andP;  It was formed in 1985 and has been activein the Unix software environment since then.andP;  The founder was Ken Greer,president, who had held previous positions with Bell Northern Research andHewlett-Packard Laboratories.andP;  It currently employs 18 people and isself-financed.andM;Besides Avalon, the company's other products to date are:andM;* Elan License Manager, a software development tool that controls multiuseraccess to software applications in a Unix network or multiuser environment.andO;That is, it provides for only licensed users to access an applicationconcurrently.andM;*Elan/Express, a document development environment for X-11.andM;* Eroff, a professional typesetting system based on Unix ditroff.andM;This market is so crowded that the other key players are looking to otherplatforms for new business.andP;  But we got the feeling in our brief acquaintancewith Avalon that it was created by people who know a lot about printpublishing--a characteristic not often found among developers addressingmarkets such as this one.andP;  That may bode well for the company, although itmay be more important to have marketing clout than it is to have publishingknowhow.andM;The product.andP;  Avalon Publisher runs under version 11 of the X Window system,using the Open Look graphical user interface and supporting context-sensitivemenus and help facilities.andP;  Initially it is available on Sun-4 andSparcstations.andP;  It drives HP LaserJet printers as well as PostScript devices.andM;Its list of features is impressive, although a few key items haven't beenaddressed yet (such as importing text in common formats).andP;  It providesautomatic index and table of contents generation, footnotes, widow/orphancontrols, thesaurus and spelling checker, kerning based on character shapesrather than pairs, flowing of multiple stories on the same page as inmagazine or newspaper layout, creation of graphics from geometric primitivesand bezier curves, and page templates for document formatting.andP;  A newversion, scheduled for release in January, will add to this lineup.andM;We don't have space to go into great detail about all of these features, butwe'll highlight some of the key ones here.andM;Document design.andP;  Document design is based on creation of page templates thatcontain frames for holding text and graphics.andP;  Templates contain frames, butthey don't carry typographic information.andM;Frames are created either visually or by filling in a property sheet thatgoverns where they start in relation to the left and top of the page, theirwidth and height, whether the frame border should be printed, and the linkorder for the frame, if it is linked.andP;  Frames can be resized by stretchingthem or editing their properties.andM;Rulers are available--in inches, centimeters, picas or points--to serve asguides in arranging elements on a page.andM;Sets of templates can be stored and used later.andP;  A set of particular ones canbe used as a layout for a new document.andP;  It is possible also to assign a newtemplate to an existing page and have it change its appearance, althoughtypographic characteristics don't change.andM;Frames can be linked and unlinked.andP;  To tell the link order of frames, thereis no display symbol, but it is possible to watch the cursor as it moves overtext and see which frame comes next.andP;  Elan says it will provide a visualindication of link order in the January release.andM;An alignment feature aligns side heads to lines of text--a capability notfound in most competitive products.andM;Composition.andP;  There are two property sheets controlling composition--fontsand paragraphs--besides the page property function that covers the size ofpage, orientation, numbering scheme and layout.andM;Font properties cover the name of the font, the size and the style (bold,italic, etc.).andP;  Paragraph properties include justification status, first lineindent, margins, space above and below paragraphs and leading (convenientlyspecified as baseline to baseline, additional leading or multiple lines).andP;  Itis possible to copy the properties of one text block to another, includingeither font or paragraph information or both.andM;To discover the label of the property sheet of an existing block of text, theuser clicks on the item.andP;  Font properties can be assigned to individual wordsor characters.andM;There currently are no style sheets for changing the definitions of paragraphproperties, but this will be included in the January release, Elan says.andO;There is no limit to the number of paragraph styles that can be set up.andM;Hyphenation controls are minimal.andP;  A sliding hyphenation scale enables theoperator to increase or decrease the amount of hyphenation by picking a valuefrom 0 to 9.andP;  We didn't have a chance to experiment with this to see how wellit works, but we recall with other vendors (including Interleaf) employingthis approach that it was &quot;user friendly&quot; but lacking sufficient controls.andM;Kerning is based on comparing the shapes of adjacent characters, using atable that can be edited by the user, rather than on a table of characterpairs.andP;  The table specifies whether the character has an ascender or adescender, what its left and right shapes are (a choice of three shapes forall characters) and the character's width.andP;  These values are compared whentext is composed and spacing adjustments are made.andP;  There is no way tooverride the results of this kerning except to edit the table, which becomesa permanent change.andP;  We don't recall any similar sector or shape kerningprogram that didn't need a provision for overriding some of its decisions,and this isn't likely to be an exception, unless the corporate market will besatisfied with less-than-ideal results.andM;There are no facilities for tracking or letterspacing.andM;The tabular composition program enables creating multiple cells or boxes bydividing an area into rectangles that can be changed later, much like afeature of most display ad systems.andM;For the spelling checker and thesaurus, Elan uses Proximity products for U.S.andO;English.andP;  (A British spelling checker also is offered.)andP;  The spelling checkeris nice, providing the ability to learn words (add them to the 80,000-worddictionary), replace them with an alternative, etc.andM;It is possible to undo the five most recent operations, one by one, and toredo an act that has been undone.andM;There is no math package, but Avalon supports math symbols.andP;  Specialcharacters and international accents are available by selecting them frompalettes displayed on the screen.andM;Pagination.andP;  Avalon provides widow/orphan controls based on specifying onevalue for the number of lines that must be kept together.andP;  Multiple storiescan appear on the same page and be continued on later pages, with the systemautomatically inserting the page number, although the user has to type in thetext portion of the continuation line.andM;Avalon displays only a single page at a time, but that page can be viewed atany percentage between 20% and 500%, or it can be sized to fit in the windowor shown at actual size.andM;To move to a different page, there are a slider bar and a button.andM;Graphics.andP;  The operator can create arcs, circles, ellipses, rectangles,lines, polylines and Bezier curves with tools found in the program.andP;  Text canbe included within drawings.andP;  Anything that appears on the screen can becaptured as a bitmap and inserted in a document.andM;Graphics can be placed in sentences and moved as if they were text when theparagraph is composed.andM;Avalon imports graphics in X-11, Sun, PCX, TIFF and MacPaint formats.andM;Ease of use.andP;  Is Avalon really easier to use than Frame or Interleaf?andP;  That'shard to say conclusively based on a couple of hours of looking at theproduct.andP;  It certainly isn't complicated.andP;  It appears to be very intuitiveand carefully thought out.andP;  We like its straightforward approach to basicoperations, and the consistency within operational procedures.andP;  Instructionsalways appear in the lower window.andP;  Text and graphics are operated on withthe same commands--not only in cutting, copying and pasting, but in applyingparagraph properties.andM;Like Interleaf, but unlike Frame, it supports context-sensitive menus.andO;Unlike all of the competitors, it uses a consistent &quot;noun/verb&quot; procedure forinitiating operations.andP;  (The user always chooses an object, then specifieswhat to do with it.)andM;Avalon has nice, easy-to-use alignment features that are probably the mostversatile of the products in this market.andP;  Frames can be aligned to otherframes or to absolute positions on a page, within many different referencepoints--one edge or the horizontal or vertical center of one frame to anotherframe or to a fixed point on a page; to the left- or right-most frame on apage or the lowest or highest frame on a page; and so on (at least 20different scenarios).andM;In addition, two paragraphs can be aligned vertically by selecting one,calling up a menu, and clicking on the second paragraph.andM;Another nice feature is the ease in inserting text from another file, whichis done by selecting the text menu and, from that, the plain text submenu.andO;Selecting insert plain text brings up a dialog box with the current directoryof files displayed.andP;  Next to it are options to &quot;go up one directory,&quot; &quot;godown one directory,&quot; &quot;go to home directory&quot; or to specify a path to access adifferent directory.andP;  The desired file is then selected with the mouse fromthe listing.andM;Similarly, to rename a file, the operator finds the name in the directory,highlights it, clicks &quot;rename file&quot; and types the new name.andM;Documentation.andP;  Elan begins its manual with a quotation from Plato: &quot;Anyonewho leaves behind him a written manual, and likewise anyone who receives it,in the belief that such writing will be clear and certain, must beexceedingly simple-minded.&quot;andP;  In spite of that warning, though, the Avalonmanual is one of the best ones we've seen.andP;  It is professionally andattractively produced (using the system), with good illustrations, aglossary, an exercise to get the user started and an index that includes mostof the terms we wanted to look up as we wrote this article.andM;As icing on the cake, it begins each chapter with some words of wisdom--or,perhaps more appropriately, some food for thought--such as the Platoquotation cited above.andP;  Another example, from Jonathan Swift: &quot;There are themen who pretend to understand a book by scouting through the index: as if atraveler should go about to describe a palace when he had seen nothing butthe privy.&quot;andP;  More appropriate in our context, probably, is this one fromAnthony Trollope: &quot;Of all the needs a book has, the chief need is, that it bereadable.&quot;andP;  Manuals rarely are, but Avalon's is.andM;GoldStar's Hana Publish for UnixandM;The Lucky-GoldStar Group is a Korean conglomerate with 33 operating divisionscovering a wide range of industries.andP;  In 1985, it started a softwaredevelopment subsidiary, GoldStar Software, Ltd., with a broad charter todevelop application and system software for the domestic and internationalmarkets.andP;  This fall, it is introducing Hana Publish to the U.S.andM;The program runs on Unix workstations from Sun (Sun-3 and Sparcstation), MIPSand Megatek, and on '386-based PC-compatible Xenix machines.andP;  The hardwareincludes a 300-dpi GoldStar laser printer and a cartridge tape drive;networking and a scanner are options.andP;  Software is Unix System V and XWindow.andM;Hana Publish reminds us of some of the earliest desktop publishing programs:a strange mixture of advanced features and missing basic functionality.andP;  Forexample, its drawing package seems to support Bezier splines and the textflow routines support footnotes and sidenotes.andP;  The program can handle TIFFfiles and 100-column tables.andP;  But its text formatting gives you a singlevalue for interword spacing, expressed in inches.andP;  Right--no matter what sizeyour type is, you get a single, absolute amount of word spacing.andP;  But that'sOK because the program only sets ragged type; there is no justified output.andM;We were not able to learn much more about the system's functionality, in partbecause of language problems.andP;  GoldStar is still very much a Korean companydoing business in a foreign country.andP;  For example, the GoldStar literaturetalks about multilanguage support, and in our demo, the font menu in somestyle sheets appeared to list some Korean font names.andP;  But the fontsassociated with those menus were ordinary Roman fonts; for the Americanmarket, GoldStar had apparently decided that non-Roman languages would not beinteresting.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
