On board were two physicians who will evaluate medical conditionsthere and propose to Armenian authorities the establishment of ``asteady stream of doctors, equipment and drugs going back and forthon a regular basis,'' said Dr. Carolann Najarian of Mount AuburnHospital in Cambridge.   It was the first such airlift from Boston since the Dec. 7 quakethat killed an estimated 25,000 people and left 500,000 peoplehomeless.   The supplies, donated from all over the United States, have beenpiling up at Logan International Airport since the day after thequake and nearly filled a large hangar provided by Trans WorldAirlines as a staging area.   Monday's airlift delivered only about a quarter of the supplies.   ``In this hangar, we've got $8 (million) to $10 million worth ofequipment,'' said Mike Nazarian, east coast chairman of MedicalOutreach for Armenia, a relief group. ``We need about two or threemore flights.''   Nazarian said he hoped to arrange another airlift for theremainder of the supplies next week.   Twelve private relief planes have departed from other cities,said Dikran Kaligian, executive director of the Armenian NationalCommittee. But two weeks ago, before transport could be arrangedfrom Logan, the Soviets called a temporary halt to shipments toArmenia in order to take stock of which supplies were needed, andwhere, he said.   Armenian church and relief officials in the United States,meanwhile, have been reluctant to airlift cargo without sendingtheir own people along to ensure the supplies reach the quakevictims for whom they are intended, Kaligian said.   Kaligian said he knows of no relief supplies that have goneastray, but the Armenians are taking no chances.   ``They could divert it to Moscow, they could take everything,''he said. ``We've had our personnel on board.''   The cargo plane and crew were provided by Pan Aviation, based inMiami and owned by Armenian-Americans. Medical Outreach paid forfuel and operating costs, Nazarian said.   The plane, loaded with bales of blankets, food, tents and medicalsupplies ranging from antacids to antibiotics, left Logan at about4:10 p.m. The schedule for the 14-hour trip to the Armenian capitalof Yerevan included a stop at Shannon, Ireland, officials said.   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., Gov. Michael S. Dukakis and hiswife, Kitty, Boston Mayor Raymond L. Flynn and state House SpeakerGeorge Keverian were at the airport at noon for a news conference onthe plane's departure.   Dukakis said the supplies being stored in the hangar reflect``the affection Massachusetts residents have for the people ofArmenia.''   The two physicians, Najarian and Dr. Richard Aghababian of theUniversity of Massachusetts at Worcester, said they wanted to set upa microbiology laboratory in Armenia to help test for infectiousdiseases, which can spread after disasters.   Mrs. Dukakis promised to help raise the money for the laboratoryif it turns out to be needed.</TEXT></DOC>
