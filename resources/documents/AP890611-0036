Authorities also expelled a British journalist, the first foreignnewsman ordered out of the country since the protest movement beganseven weeks ago.   At a rally Friday, students gave the Shanghai municipalgovernment 48 hours to agree to direct talks on democratic reform,publicize the truth of the military attack in Beijing and fly flagsat half-staff in this city to commemorate the victims of Beijing.   Chinese troops stormed Beijing's central square a week ago,shooting their way through the student-led protesters. Westerndiplomats and U.S. intelligence sources have estimated that 3,000were killed.   The People's Square in downtown Shanghai was largely empty Sundaydespite students' threat to resort to stronger tactics if theirultimatum was not met.   The inactivity by protesters was reflected across China as thegovernment intensified its crackdown, rounding up leaders ofindependent worker and student groups and waging a propaganda war todiscredit demonstrators.   ``Our hearts support the students' struggle for democracy,'' saidone worker at a cargo firm. ``But many people feel it is time tostop the protests and think of the best way to achieve the goal.''   ``There was no way the government would agree to their demands,''said a young worker at Shanghai's riverfront. ``They know thestudents are all gone, that they're not at their schools.''   News reports in Shanghai, the largest city in China with apopulation of 12 million, announced more arrests Sunday in acontinuing crackdown, but no figure was given. Up to 680 people havebeen arrested nationwide, according to partial estimates in somecities.   Yao Yongzhan, identified as head of the Autonomous Union ofShanghai College Students, was arrested at Shanghai's internationalairport in the company of consular officials from an unnamedcountry, Shanghai radio said.   Police also arrested Weng Zhengming, chairman of the China YouthDemocratic Party in Shanghai, on Saturday, state-run television newssaid. It claimed Weng had drafted plans as early as 1986 tooverthrow the ruling Communist Party.   About 200 workers mobilized by the government to maintain ordergathered outside Tongji University. Workers said Mayor Zhu Rongjiordered 10 percent of all factory workers in Shanghai to report forsuch duty.   ``We're here to keep traffic flowing smoothly,'' said a22-year-old woman at the Tongji University gate. She denied thegroup was there to keep students from marching off campus.   City officials also cracked down on foreign journalists.   Authorities ordered Peter Newport of Britain's IndependentTelevision News out of the country for filming a student sit-in infront of Shanghai's police headquarters, said a British diplomaticsource speaking on condition of anonymity.   The Shanghai municipal government issued an open letter Saturdayto all diplomatic missions in the city, instructing them to telljournalists from their countries that they cannot cover news inShanghai without government permission.   ``Some unexpected danger may arise and we are unable to guaranteetheir life security,'' said the English letter, signed by theconsular division of Shanghai's Foreign Affairs Office. ``Pleasecall the journalists' attention to that.''</TEXT></DOC>
