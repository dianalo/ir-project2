Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said in London the soldiersopened fire Sunday after the unarmed IRA guerrillas parked a whiteRenault-5 with Spanish license plates near The Convent, theofficial residence of the governor. He said the soldiers acted on atip from Spanish police.   Police said they were searching Gibraltar and adjacent Spanishterritory for a car believed connected with a bomb attack the IrishRepublican Army allegedly planned at the governor's residenceduring the ceremonial changing of the guard, which hundreds ofspectators attend.   Members of the Royal Anglian Regiment, just transferred fromduty in Northern Ireland, were scheduled to participate in theceremony Tuesday. The IRA is fighting a guerrilla war to drive theBritish from Northern Ireland.   In Belfast, Northern Ireland, gangs of youths charged into thestreets Monday afternoon, throwing firebombs at buses, vans andtrucks in violence that continued into the evening, police reported.   Bus service in Roman Catholic areas was halted after severalbuses were set afire.   A police spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with Britishpractice, said he did not know if the attacks were a reaction tothe reports from Gibraltar.   The two men and a woman were shot by men described by witnessesas wearing jeans and speaking with British accents.   The British soldiers were believed to be members of the SpecialAir Services, or SAS, an elite undercover unit that has beeninvolved in previous actions against the IRA.   Sgt. George Field of the 220-man Gibraltar police force saidofficers were looking for a Ford automobile but did not believe itcontained explosives.   The independent Spanish news agency Europa Press quoted policein Madrid, however, as saying the car might contain explosivesintended for an attack Tuesday.   Howe acknowledged in his remarks to Parliament that the threeIRA members were on foot and unarmed when they were killed Sundayafternoon while heading for the Spanish frontier.   He said they were challenged and ``made movements which ledsecurity personnel to believe their lives were in danger.''   ``There is no doubt whatever that as a result of yesterday'sevents a dreadful terrorist act has been averted,'' Howe said.``The three people killed were actively involved in the planningand attempted execution of that act.''   The foreign secretary also said a fourth IRA guerilla ``recentlycrossed into Gibraltar and is thought to have carried out areconnaissance for an act of terrorism.''   Gasoline pumps at the Shell service station where two were shotdown bore several bullet holes police had marked with blue arrows.About 100 hundred yards up the avenue, where the third fell, whitemarks on a large tree indicated more bullet holes.   Howe said the soldiers found keys to a second car on the body ofone of the men. That car, a red Ford Fiesta registered in Spain,was found parked in La Linea de la Concepcion on the Spanish sideof the gate separating this 2.25-square-mile limestone rock fromthe Spanish mainland.   In the Ford, police found three false passports, an alarm clock,insulating tape, gloves, wire and a set of keys to the third car,which police are searching for, Howe said.   He said reports that the Renault contained several hundredpounds of explosives were unfounded.   Europa Press said Spanish police speculated that the IRA membersleft the Renault near the Convent to make sure there would be spacefor the third car, which they planned to park on Tuesday rigged asa as a car bomb.   The IRA identified the dead as Mairead Farrell, 31, who served10 years in prison for bombing a Belfast hotel; Daniel McCann, 30,and Sean Savage, 24, all of West Belfast. The men had been arrestedon charges of possessing explosives.   Sir Peter Terry, the governor and commander-in-chief of Britishforces in the colony, issued a statement praising the 30,000residents and said the people of Gibraltar showed ``theirdetermination to stand alongside all British people in their fightagainst international terrorism.''   Augustin Valladolid, spokesman for Spanish state security, saidin Madrid that Spanish police spotted the three IRA members on thesouthern Costa del Sol more than a month ago and told Britishauthorities, who requested surveillance but no intervention.   El Pais, Spain's leading daily, said they left Spain a week ago,probably for Britain, ``but planned to return to Malaga and did.''It quoted Spanish police as saying they followed the trio ``rightup to the gate'' of Gibraltar.   In Parliament, Howe expressed gratitude to Spanish authorities,``without whose invaluable assistance the outcome might have beenvery different.''   Gibraltar is a sore point in relations between Britain andSpain, which claims sovereignty over the rock it ceded in 1713after losing the War of Spanish Succession.</TEXT></DOC>
