In some instances,natural gas prices were low enough in summer 1987 to beat out coal innorthern Michigan and other areas. A primary fuel source in the U.S.,and the one with the least competition from imports, natural gas pricesbegan dropping as all other energy products did in 1982. Prices driftedslowly down during 1983 through 1985 because of the excess transportationavailable and competition from newly found supplies. All were competingfor a declining market share. The soft slide became a drastic drop inmid-1986 when crude oil prices tumbled from the mid$20/bbl range to under$9/bbl in some cases. The rapid descent of crude oil and product pricescarried natural gas down, too.</TEXT></DOC>
