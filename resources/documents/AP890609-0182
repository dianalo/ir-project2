Military presence was felt throughout the city. Convoys of trucksand foot soldiers patrolled by day. More than 100 tanks and armoredpersonnel carriers rumbled through the center of Beijing after dark.   The Foreign Ministry advised embassies to keep staff membersindoors at night, but it did not impose a curfew.   Opposition receded in provincial cities, where soldiers andpolice were called out to stop days of protest.   A Chinese witness said police, in their pursuit of suspectintellectuals, had searched one hotel room-by-room for a suspect,who was not identified.   ``We live now under terror,'' a student said.   Deng, 84, quashed rumors that he was seriously ill or out ofpower by making his first public appearance since May 16, when hemet with visiting Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   On the evening television news, he was shown with other hard-lineleaders, including Premier Li Peng and President Yang Shangkun,posing for a picture with senior military officials at CommunistParty headquarters.   The officials stood for a minute of silence in tribute tosoldiers who died ``in putting down a counterrevolutionaryrebellion'' over the weekend, the official news agency Xinhuareported.   ``Facing a life-threatening situation, our troops never forgotthe people, never forgot the party, never forgot the country'sinterest,'' Deng said, speaking forcefully and gesturing foremphasis.   Party chief Zhao Ziyang was absent, as were fellow reformists HuQili and Tian Jiyun. Reports have said Zhao was stripped of powerfor opposing the May 20 declaration of martial law in Beijing.   Diplomatic and Western intelligence estimates say about 3,000people were killed when the 27th Army entered the city last Saturdayand cleared student demonstrators from Tiananmen Square. Thegovernment puts the figure at 300, most of them soldiers, and hassaid no one was killed in the square.   In Washington, the White house said reprisals against protestleaders were ``repugnant.''   ``Keep in mind that the government has murdered many, many of itscitizens,'' spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters.   Soldiers stood at most intersections in Beijing and stopped carsat night to demand identification.   Hundreds were posted on college campuses, where the protestsbegan in mid-April.   Martial law authorities issued a new order banning``counterrevolutionary'' posters and pamphlets, and non-militarysecurity forces entered campuses to rip down anti-government posters.   One apartment block still bore a huge sign proclaiming: ``Thestudents must be victorious. Long live the people,'' but mostbuildings had government banners urging unity against the rebels.   In the provinces, the only protest reported Friday was inShanghai, China's largest city. About 50,000 students and supportersgathered in a square to mourn six people killed Tuesday when a traincrashed though a barricade built on the tracks.   State television showed soldiers patrolling Chengdu, in thesouthwest, and the ruins of a department store burned by protesters.Police were shown making arrests in Wuhan and Harbin, two of thecities where crowds burned buses and blocked roads.   U.S. Ambassador James Lilley said 70 more Americans left Beijingon Friday, including his wife. The embassy estimated 400 Americansremained in the city, including 100 embassy employees, down fromabout 2,500 before martial law. Most other foreigners were gone.   There were no confirmed arrests of student leaders or dissidents,but Chinese sources reported police taking suspects from homes and aWestern diplomat said: ``We know that they're picking people up allover the place.''   The government has announced arrests of dozens of people inBeijing and other cities, all accused of attacking soldiers orburning buses.   A letter read on television, the writer not identified, saidChina's best-known dissident, Fang Lizhi, was a traitor and shouldbe arrested. Fang and his wife took refuge in the U.S. Embassy thisweek.   Increased patrols indicated a new confidence by the military thatcitizens would not attack. Also, the troops were clearly unitedafter several days in which small skirmishes were reported withunits opposed to the crackdown.   Soldiers raised the flag over Tiananmen, site of the protests,for the first time since retaking the 100-acre square from thestudents early Sunday.   Television showed a military band playing the national anthem asthe red flag was raised, and broadcast an aerial view of the squarewith hundreds of trucks and dozens of tanks lined up.   Some buses resumed operations Friday and were allowed to crossthe square's northern end.   Soldiers continued clearing away charred frames of buses, tanksand trucks burned by crowds trying to stop the army advance lastweekend. Neighborhood committees organized teams of residents tohelp.   Army trucks with loudspeakers drove through the streetsproclaiming: ``Our task is to protect social order. ... We want yourunderstanding.''   In the English-language China Daily, a headline said saboteursshould be crushed with ``iron fists.''   A bicyclist said: ``There are plainclothes police everywhere. Noone dares to talk. I still support the slogans `Uphold democracy'and `Oppose official corruption,' but now there is no way to expresssuch ideas.''   A senior Chinese official said Friday stressed China's economicreform that since 1978 ``broke the closed and rigid economic modeand unfettered the productive forces'' will not change.   ``Despite some temporary difficulties in China's reform, theorientation of our reform and the open policy will not change,'' LiBorong, vice-minister of labor, told the 150-nation InternationalLabor Organization conference in Geneva.</TEXT></DOC>
