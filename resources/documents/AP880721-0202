The resolution was pushed by delegates for Jesse Jackson, whothis week raised the possibility that he might renew efforts tofree the hostages now that the Iranians have agreed to accept acease fire in the war with Iraq.   New Yorkers acted on the resolution because Terry Anderson, thelongest-held American hostage, grew up in Batavia, N.Y., accordingto Joyce Burns, an alternate delegate from Orchard Park.   Anderson, The Associated Press' chief Middle East correspondent,was seized by gunmen in Beirut in March 1985.   The resolution asks the convention ``to bring the plight of theAmerican hostages before the American people.''   Should Michael Dukakis be elected president in November, theresolution asks that his administration ``have as a priorityfreedom for all present hostages and a commitment to positiveresponses to conflicts among people.''   Burns said there was not enough time to arrange for speakers tomention the hostages on the convention podium, but some New Yorkdelegates brought placards to the floor of The Omni arena Thursdaynight saying: ``Bring Our Hostages Home From Lebanon Now.''   Other delegates sported yellow ribbons to remember the hostages.   In the past Jackson has met with leaders and ambassadors fromMiddle Eastern countries in an attempt to win freedom for theAmericans held in Lebanon.   He said on Monday that he may renew intense efforts to free thehostages, who are thought to be held by pro-Iranian LebaneseShiites. Jackson made an appeal on behalf of Anderson and the otherhostages in his speech to the convention Tuesday night.</TEXT></DOC>
