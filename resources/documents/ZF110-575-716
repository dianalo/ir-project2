Number 1 is - if you don't know it yet -  silicon is free.andP;  Number2.andP;  and partially related to that.andM;silicon is plentiful.andP;  Number 3, tactical fabs - any fab youandM;intend to actually make money on - are prohibitivelyandM;expensive.andP;  And Number 4, as a result of the first threeandM;changes, value in components is moving further andandM;further away from the silicon.andP;  We must recognize that theandM;semiconductor company has to change.andP;  THAT WAS THEN...andP;  - The first era ofsemiconductorandM;technology began at the dawn of time and ended sometimeandM;in the 1980s.andP;  This era was characterized by the phraseandM;&quot;silicon is the world's most expensive real estate.&quot; WhenandM;I was an engineer buying chips.andP;  that was always theandM;explanation for why chips were so expensive.andP;  If silicon is very expensive,you want to conserve it, maxi -  mize yields, make chips as small as possibleand get downandM;the learning curve as quickly as possible because youandM;don't want to throw this expensive stuff away.andP;  As a resultandM;of the high cost of silicon, fabrication and fabricators ruledandM;design and designers.andP;  What could be designed was veryandM;strongly governed by what could actually be built, andandM;built economically.andP;  That sums up the first era.andP;  ...  THIS IS NOW - We'renow in the second era in whichandM;we're going to say silicon is free.andP;  We don't think about itandM;any more as the world's most expensive real estate.andM;Instead we think about it as a commodity that, by itself,andM;does not have any unique value.andP;  The emphasis becomes very different ifsilicon is reallyandM;cheap.andP;  We want to use as much of it as we possibly can.andM;Instead of building really tiny chips, we want to buildandM;much larger chips.andP;  And instead of being concernedandM;principally about the manufacturing learning curve, all of aandM;sudden we get concerned about design, tooling, test, and This is an editedexcerpt from an address at our fifth annual conference on The SemiconductorOutlook.andP;  The address was presented in Santa Clara, Calif., on September 11,1990.andM;thinks that strain the ability to take advantage of thisandM;widely available and relatively inexpensive resource.andM;What can be built is governed by what can be designed,andM;and instead of the fabrication process and the fabricatorsandM;holding aD the keys to value, design and designers do.andP;  A FRESH LOOK ATFIGURES - Let's take a look at 1989andM;and make some wild assumptions.andP;  Let's assume a oneandM;micron process, running on an 8-inch wafer with 80%andM;yield.andP;  We're building centimeter-square chips and theyandM;have conventional perimeter I/O.andP;  What do we get? WeD, my numbers say that inmemory density for DRAM,andM;you get 9 million bits per square inch, 300 million bits perandM;wafer, which is 37 1/2 megabytes per wafer.andP;  In logicandM;density.andP;  you get about 4 million transistors per squareandM;inch and 120 million transistors per wafer.andP;  These sound like very largenumbers, but let's projectandM;ourselves ahead to 1999.andP;  Let's be conservative andandM;assume a 3/10 micron process in which the wafers getandM;bigger.andP;  I don't think we are going to building on 10-inchandM;wafers, but this assumes a 13% per year annual increase inandM;area of the wafer.andP;  In fact yields have been going up, butandM;let's say that we've hit a limit in square chips.andP;  You getandM;150 million bits per square inch, all other things beingandM;equal and 7 1/2 billion bits per wafer, which is about aandM;gigabyte per wafer.andP;  You get 70 million transistors perandM;square inch if you are building logic, and about 3 1/2andM;billion transistors per wafer.andP;  Again it sounds like bigandM;numbers, but what does it all mean? FALLING PRICES - Let's ask how muchtransistors cost orandM;how much a DRAM bit costs.andP;  I've plotted this in constantandM;1989 microcents - a reasonable unit of measure until weandM;get to the year 2000 where we have to think in terms ofandM;nanocents.andP;  This is going to be a busy year, so a logicandM;transistor costs about 800 microcents to build (given allandM;the assumptions I've just made), a bit of DRAM costsandM;about 300 microcents just for the the, but by the year 2010,andM;we're talking about roughly 800 nanocents per logicandM;transistor and about 300 nanocents per DRAM bit.andP;  Again using theseassumptions, which don't represent actualandM;costs today, let's say a wafer is a thousand bucks.andM;Theoretically a megabyte of DRAM is about $27, whichandM;falls to $1.10 in 1999, and 1 million transistor processor,andM;theoretically about $8, falls to about 29cts.andP;  Now we'reandM;talking about it being in the range of a buck.andP;  We're notandM;using too many million transistor processors today, butandM;that's going to be a commodity part in 10 years.andP;  Let's look at a 15 mipsworkstation with 16 megabytes ofandM;memory.andP;  I'm assuming a silicon manufacturing cost ofandM;about $500, which falls to about $18 in 1999.andP;  If youandM;assume the the manufacturing cost is perhaps 5% of theandM;ultimate selling price of a product, then you could figureandM;out how expensive these products are.andP;  An $18 semiconductorandM;manufacturing cost is a $350 product.andP;  THE END PRODUCT - Think about a $350end product.andM;The first one I came up with was my microwave oven.andP;  SoandM;now we're talking about a microwave oven with 15 mipsandM;and 16 megabytes of memory.andP;  That's not going to helpandM;my cooking, but it's not a crazy thing to consider.andM;Telephones, pocket computers, automobile electronics, allandM;these products don't even start to explore what you can doandM;if you want to spend 500 bucks manufacturing theandM;semiconductor content of a product.andP;  What is that going to yield in terms ofprocessing power andandM;memory capacity? What are we going to do with that?andM;We've got to stop worrying about building costs and startandM;worrying about what to do with end products.andP;  This willandM;change manufacturing to a tremendous degree.andP;  CHEAP M EMORY - Increasingintegration means moreandM;transistors per wafer.andP;  Either devices are going to get moreandM;complex and we're going to consume all these transistors,andM;or we're going to need fewer wafers.andP;  Which is it going toandM;be? It could legitimately be either one.andP;  Certainly theandM;schism between memory and logic is changing.andP;  Memory demand is bit-costelastic, the bits get cheaper,andM;demand increases.andP;  We can easily figure out what to doandM;with cheaper memory bits.andP;  If you are designing aandM;memory, all of a sudden density increases fourfold.andP;  YouandM;double the number of rows, double the number ofandM;columns, add one pin if it's a DRAM, and you've takenandM;advantage of the increase of complexity.andP;  At the system level it's fairlysimple to know how to takeandM;advantage of the memory, and the fact that systems canandM;use the same kind of memory relatively efficiently meansandM;the product will be able to quickly take advantage ofandM;emerging technologies.andP;  Still, I'm not sure the manufacturingandM;of memory is going to change a tremendous amount.andP;  LOGIC ISN'T THAT EASY -Unlike memory demand, logicandM;demand is not inherently transistor-cost elastic.andP;  JustandM;because you can have four times more transistors, doesn'tandM;mean you're going to know what to do with them.andP;  If youandM;are designing a microprocessor that's got a millionandM;transistors and the next generation is going to be fourandM;million transistors, you can't just double rows andandM;columns and add one pin.andP;  It doesn't work that way.andM;There's a lot more applications engineering, moreandM;architectural work that has to be done to figure out how toandM;take advantage of increased logic at the silicon level andandM;the end application level.andP;  We have a march of silicon technology.andP;  Pick yourown rate,andM;memory evolution can easily keep up with it from a supplyandM;and demand standpoint and logic evolution can keep upandM;with it from a manufacturing capacity standpoint, but can'tandM;necessarily, at least not simply, keep up from a deviceandM;designer application standpoint.andP;  Memory and logic deviceandM;manufacturing are going to have to be treated veryandM;differently.andP;  COMPULSIVE CONSUMING - If you assume some amountandM;of logic sales in 1989, you get roughly 1.25 x 10&quot; logicandM;transistors produced last year.andP;  Then you look at theandM;capacity on a wafer in 1999 and calculate what I can theandM;coming logic transistor glut.andP;  If wafers grow to, say, 10andM;inches, with no additional fab lines and no additionalandM;wafer starts, compound annual growth in logic transistorandM;production capacity will be 92% by 1999.andP;  To keep upandM;with that, every man, woman, and child in the knownandM;universe will have to consume double the number ofandM;transistors every year as in the previous year for a ten yearandM;period.andP;  Let's say that's not going to happen and, instead, the doublingandM;period is every two years, with a 40% annual growth.andP;  YouandM;end up eating 4% of the wafers that were produced in 1989andM;to meet the demand of 1999.andP;  Actually it gets even moreandM;interesting if you go out to the year 2009, where unless weandM;are able to keep transistor demand increasing at 70% toandM;100% per year, we are riot going to have to worry aboutandM;manufacturing over a ten year period.andP;  Capacity is not theandM;problem.andP;  We are going to start wasting these transistors,andM;because they are not so precious any more.andP;  This focus onandM;manufacturing is obsolete and misses the point.andP;  IT'S ONLY MONEY - Let's takea look at a conventional fabandM;model.andP;  Tactical fabs, as I've stated in the forces ofandM;change, are prohibitively expensive.andP;  A company I wasandM;talking to recently had me confused for a while, becauseandM;they kept referring to their stealth bombers.andP;  I said,  IandM;don't understand this.andP;  I know you do a little bit of defenseandM;work, but I didn't really think you were the primeandM;contractor on this plane.&quot; They said, &quot;No, no, no, we're not talking aboutthe plane,andM;we're talking about our fabs.andP;  We call them our stealthandM;bombers, because they cost us $600 million and we figureandM;that we have a choice between building one or buying aandM;stealth bomber.&quot; So we're already into the cost stratosphere,andM;and I sometimes think there's a race to see who isandM;going to crack the billion dollar barrier fastest.andM;This reminds me of a congressman who remarked, &quot;Gee, aandM;billion here, a billion there, pretty soon we're talking aboutandM;real money.&quot; We're talking about real money for fabs.andM;Fabs make no sense unless money is free.andP;  The realandM;question is not the cost of money but whether you everandM;have to pay the money back at all.andP;  FALLACY SOMEWHERE, I FANCY - Fabs will bebuilt, butandM;they make little sense.andP;  Paradoxically the existence ofandM;these fabs will actually push some wafer costs down andandM;make wafers much more available to those people whoandM;don't build the fabs.andP;  These fabs arc going to have to doandM;something.andP;  I am not a semiconductor fab economist, but I am a businessandM;person.andP;  Let's assume we're investing a certain amount ofandM;money, that there's some maintenance associated with it,andM;and that we have to pay the money back at some reasonableandM;interest rates.andP;  Let's assume that the money costs usandM;10%, and that maintenance and recapitalization of thisandM;facility costs us 10% of initial cost per year.andP;  On a straightandM;line basis what are the carrying and maintenance recapitalizationandM;costs over the life of the fab? If you take a five year amortization, whichis probablyandM;reasonable given the rate of evolution of technology, theandM;costs are about 35% a year; given a ten year amortization,andM;the costs are about 25% a year.andP;  If you want to write it offandM;in five years, carrying costs on a billion dollar fab are $350andM;million a year, if you want to write it off in ten, they areandM;$250 million a year.andP;  THE MONEY PIT - But what does it mean in terms of thefabandM;cost, carrying cost, contribution to the wafer cost? DivideandM;those costs by how many wafers you expect to produce perandM;year - you have to have a very, very busy fab just to payandM;the carrying costs.andP;  That doesn't let you operate the fab,andM;amortize any Randamp;D, maintain any distribution network, orandM;any overhead expenses.andP;  That's simply paying back theandM;fab.andP;  So, unless somebody gives you the money, and says,andM;&quot;Don't worry about paying me back,&quot; it's hard to see howandM;fabs make any economic sense.andP;  You could decide that wafer costs have to riseto cover theseandM;costs, but I'm riot sure it's going to work that way.andP;  RecentandM;evidence is that there are a lot of people who don't buildandM;fabs to make money and are actually losing a lot of moneyandM;on fabs.andP;  In this current climate, it's hard to justify puttingandM;up one of those fabs.andP;  The wafers are widely available forandM;a thousand bucks each or less, in fact the prices I've seenandM;recently aTe astounding.andP;  Just to cover the carrying costs ofandM;a vertically integrated fab to pay back a $500 millionandM;facility, the fab has to consume $200 million dollars ofandM;wafers per year.andP;  A company has to gross $500 million to aandM;billion before one of these behemoth fabs makes sense.andP;  MANY HAPPY RETURNS? -andO;If you look at production andandM;at cost and value, which are at odds with each other rightandM;now, technological evolution is is pushing the cost to buildandM;a fab up.andP;  Overcapacity is reducing the value of that fab, soandM;the return on investment is getting worse over time.andP;  WhyandM;invest in production when you can invest in other value-added? The trends areworking in the opposite direction.andP;  In applicationandM;innovation you use these transistors to do something.andM;Technological evolution is pushing the cost of exploitationandM;down and pushing the value up, because we have thisandM;growing &quot;applications gap.&quot; Where then should youandM;invest? It's clear over the next 10 to 20 years, financialandM;returns will come from the application of these devices asandM;opposed to production.andP;  STRATEGY AND TACTICS - Who's going to build fabs?andM;Memory producers, for one, will build fabs because thatandM;paradigm is not going to change.andP;  Also, very largeandM;vertically integrated companies who can pay for the fabsandM;are saying, &quot;Hey, this is a large investment, but strategicallyandM;it makes sense to us, and we won't necessarilyandM;charge all of the expenses away to the operation of theandM;fab.&quot; Those two manufacturers will create capacityandM;relatively cheaply.andP;  When I was a kid growing up, if you wanted to get intoandM;electronics as a nation you built transistor radios andandM;television sets and you talked about how many transistorsandM;were in the transistor radio.andP;  These days you buildandM;semiconductors and you talk about how many bits are inandM;your DRAM or how many gates are in your gate array.andP;  IfandM;you're willing to make a strategic investment you can getandM;into the business.andP;  So there will be strategic fabs notandM;tactical fabs.andP;  With the strategic fab, the intent is not necessarily to makeandM;money, and that's going to keep supply up and costandM;relatively down.andP;  Ultimately, looking way into the future,andM;we'll see a consortium of consumers that maintain a fabandM;capacity at a rate that makes sense, and ultimately we winandM;see equilibrium in supply and demand.andP;  But building fabsandM;that make tactical sense is at least ten years away.andP;  INS AND OUTS -Semiconductor companies' value-added isandM;determined by the difference between input and output.andM;Back in the dawn of time, the value-added was basicandM;processing - sand in and transistors out.andP;  The normalandM;semiconductor company of the 90s is going to takeandM;processed wafers in and applications, architectures, andandM;support software out.andP;  By 2010 or 2020 what we now callandM;semiconductor companies will take standard architecturesandM;and process wafers with somebody else's circuits that areandM;topologically programmable, procedurally programmable,andM;or some combination of those things and add architecturalandM;value-added and software value-added so the value-addedandM;changes dramatically.andP;  The traditional semiconductor company of 1975 had bigfab,andM;process development, circuit design, architecturalandM;development, and distribution through some reps andandM;distributors, but the big emphasis was on fab, on beingandM;able to build things.andP;  That started to fall apart in the 1980s.andP;  MODELBEHAVIOUR - Since then we've tried a couple ofandM;models.andP;  One of them is the ASICs model where directandM;distribution was the big asset and our customers would doandM;architectural development.andP;  We focused on fab, circuitandM;design, and CAI) development, and got some partners toandM;help us with process development.andP;  Our value-added wasandM;the ability to HA the fab very efficiently into the customerandM;environment.andP;  The problem is that slowly the uniqueness of the fab droppedandM;away.andP;  The uniqueness of the circuit design cells and gateandM;arrays dropped away, the uniqueness of the CAD softwareandM;dropped away, and the uniqueness of the distributionandM;dropped away as merchant CAD and better user trainingandM;enabled more people to do ASICs.andP;  All of a sudden youandM;end up with a company structured with very little value-added.andM;Most of the companies that started out looking likeandM;this are now struggling to add value-added in differentandM;ways and move away from this ASICs model.andP;  In the 1980s we tried theapplication specific standards modelandM;where we again controlled distribution, a major elementandM;from a support standpoint.andP;  Now we're going to focus onandM;an architectural development and go outside for fab.andP;  ToandM;do that we're going to develop some CAD tools that helpandM;us be somewhat promiscuous with respect to the fab weandM;are using and also some circuit design that aids us in thatandM;process.andP;  My favorite examples here are Chips andandM;Technologies and Cirrus Logic.andP;  We've got an architectural value-added that'sa bridgeandM;between fabrication and the customer, but we're stillandM;focusing on circuit design and CAD software develop -  ment.andP;  And myprediction is that the 1990s will break upandM;one further stage and the CAU CAD software developmentandM;will become a business by itself.andP;  You won't evenandM;need it for process portability.andP;  DO YOU HAVE A LICENSE? - We are starting tosee allandM;kinds of people floating around who license their circuitandM;design and process development capabilities in the virtualandM;mold.andP;  Volume fabs go outside for some of these, and thisandM;creates a network that feeds what is now the semiconductorandM;company, providing value-added at principally theandM;architectural system software levels and to the customerandM;through system definition and system integration.andP;  There's one more step inthis process in which some of theandM;hardware architectural development floats into what I'mandM;now calling the &quot;technology portfolio,&quot; where licensingandM;companies are developing value-added and licensing themandM;for further use.andP;  Basic hardware architectures are beingandM;integrated into systems, and the real value is at the systemsandM;integrations and software level.andP;  Software is going toandM;matter more and value-added is changing radically.andP;  You can plot theprofitability of a semiconductor company toandM;the first order based on its percentage of Randamp;D directedandM;towards software.andP;  The greater percentage of softwareandM;development, typically the greater the profitability of theandM;company.andP;  But the customer doesn't realize that yet.andP;  THINK AGAIN - We havechallenges to face as we moveandM;forward.andP;  One of them is rethinking what a semiconductorandM;company is.andP;  How do we build value in the customersandM;eyes? How do we structure ourselves to build valueandM;appropriately given where the real value is? And how doandM;we effect distribution mechanisms that appropriatelyandM;match that value so that the customer perceives it and alsoandM;the contribution of the component's supplier? With that IandM;wish you all very good luck into the next millennium.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
