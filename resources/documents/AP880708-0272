(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Financier Marvin Warner was stunnedby a jury verdict requiring him to pay $22.6 million forfraudulently removing money from a failing securities dealer, whilehis attorney challenged the jury's competence to decide the complexcase.   But Thomas Tew, bankruptcy trustee for the failed ESM GovernmentSecurities, hailed Thursday's verdict in his civil suit againstWarner as ``a slam dunk.''   The six-member federal jury was asked to decide 22 questions asTew accused Warner of fraudulently withdrawing money from ESM whenhe knew the firm was in dire financial trouble. Tew also chargedWarner with profiting from insider information and loaning ESMmoney in exchange for profits on bogus financial transactions.   ``We had to get 19 questions answered our way before we got apenny, and they only had to get three questions answered their wayto win across the board,'' Tew said. ``But we got 22 out of 22right. It was a slam dunk.''   ESM failed in 1985 with $315 million in losses. Warner'sCincinnati-based thrift, Home State Savings Bank, was ESM's biggestcustomer and collapsed days later, triggering a savings and loanpanic in Ohio.   Warner, 69, a former U.S. ambassador to Switzerland who nowlives on an Ocala horse ranch, promised an appeal. He was visiblyupset when he heard the verdict and said: ``I'm stunned. Terribly.''   Last year, Warner was acquitted of federal criminal charges butconvicted of state charges in Ohio and sentenced to three years inconnection with Home State's collapse. He is free while appealingthat conviction.   Warner's attorney, Andrew Hall, said Thursday's verdict was``clearly a decision based on court passion. Clearly the jury didnot understand what this case was about.''   The lawsuit claimed Warner violated securities, racketeering andcivil theft statutes to unjustly profit from ESM's failure.   Warner won a strategic victory on the final day of testimonywhen U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez Jr. ruled the plaintiff hadnot proven Warner was involved in securities fraud.   Before the verdict, Warner said, ``Regardless of the financialoutcome, what that judge did vindicated me.''   But the jury found that Warner ``actually participated in thefraudulent purpose'' of ESM.   He held a personal account at ESM and encouraged Home State toinvest with the obscure Fort Lauderdale firm.   Tew's lawyers claimed Warner was an insider at ESM who demandedand was given special treatment because of Home State's hugeinvestments.   But Hall depicted Warner as ``the largest single victim of ESM'sfraud. ... If you are a victim, how can you be an insider.''   Tew has charged that Warner, who filed for reorganization underfederal bankruptcy laws, has placed his fortune in his family'sname to protect his funds from court-ordered penalties.</TEXT></DOC>
