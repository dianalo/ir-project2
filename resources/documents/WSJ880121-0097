Feud Calms as Relatives Weigh Sale of Stake </HL><SO> </SO><CO> SBG.A </CO><IN> TNM RFD </IN><DATELINE> MONTREAL  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Members of the feuding family that controls Steinberg Inc., one of Canada's largest supermarket chains, said they have agreed to consider the possible sale of their stake in the company.    The four Steinberg family trusts, which own 40% of the company's voting shares, said they agreed to consider &quot;the various alternatives open to them,&quot; including sale of their shares and maintaining their interest in the company.    The company's board said earlier this week that it would seek ways of maximizing shareholder values, including possible sale of the company.    The statement appears to indicate a shift in position by Marilyn Steinberg Cobrin and Evelyn Steinberg Alexander -- two of the daughters of Samuel Steinberg, the company's late founder -- who previously opposed any sale.    As previously reported, a third Steinberg sister, Mitzi Steinberg Dobrin, and her husband, Steinberg Chairman Melvyn Dobrin, earlier launched a lawsuit alleging that Mrs. Cobrin and Mrs. Alexander had ignored the interests of the trusts and disregarded &quot;serious and substantial offers&quot; for Steinberg shares.    According to court documents filed by the Dobrins, the two other Steinberg sisters refused to consider an informal bid valued at one billion Canadian dollars ($777.9 million) made for the company last August. The bidder wasn't identified.    Mortimer Freiheit, the Dobrins' lawyer, said he considers the agreement to study the alternatives for the trusts' shares &quot;a step in the right direction and that's what we were asking for some time ago.&quot;    The trusts said that they may consult with professional financial advisers to assist them in their decision.    Steinberg Class A shares closed yesterday on the Toronto Stock Exchange at 38.625 dollars, up 87.5 cents.    Steven Holt, an analyst with Midland Doherty Ltd., Toronto, said he welcomed the move &quot;because it's a movement closer to a consensus&quot; although he said there isn't any assurance an outside offer for the company will be forthcoming. </TEXT></DOC>
