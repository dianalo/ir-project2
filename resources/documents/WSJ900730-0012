Shortly after Judge Stanley Weisberg's decision, IraReiner, Los Angeles district attorney, said he would not tryMr. Buckey a third time. Jurors later said they were leaningtoward acquittal on six of the eight counts against him.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The McMartin case is over,&quot; said Deputy District AttorneyJoseph Martinez at a news conference.   It was the end of a controversial case that began inManhattan Beach, Calif., in August 1983 and resulted in thelongest and costliest criminal trial in U.S. history. Mr.Buckey spent nearly five years in prison.   &quot;No one has won in the McMartin case,&quot; Mr. Buckey toldreporters. &quot;Now I would like to be just left alone. . . .This is not the kind of life I would have planned out.&quot;   Hours before Judge Weisberg stopped the trial, the juryasked him to allow them to review the only two verdicts theyhad so far submitted. The two verdicts had not been madepublic. The judge granted their request and only minuteslater jurors announced their impasse.   In interviews with reporters the jurors said the twosealed verdicts had initially been unanimous votes foracquittal. On only one count was there a majority vote for aguilty verdict.   Mr. Buckey's ordeal began seven years ago when a woman,now deceased, told local police she believed her son had beenmolested at the Virginia McMartin Preschool.   In January, after a 28-month trial and three months ofdeliberations, another jury acquitted Mr. Buckey, 32, and hismother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, on 52 out of 65 counts ofchild molestation.   The acquittals provoked a wave of protest among parents ofthe allegedly molested children and victims rights groups. InFebruary, Mr. Reiner, at the time a Democratic candidate forstate attorney general, announced he would retry Mr. Buckeyon eight of the deadlocked counts.   Those charges involved three girls, now teen-agers, whoattended the preschool between 1979 and 1983. Defenseattorney Danny Davis called the move for a retrial &quot;banalstupidity&quot; and accused the district attorney of using thecase for political purposes.   According to the Los Angeles County auditor, from August1983 through May 1990, the case cost California taxpayersalmost $14 million.   Mr. Buckey has never deviated from his claims ofinnocence.</TEXT></DOC>
