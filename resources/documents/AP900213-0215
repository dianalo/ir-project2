Currently, the largest-capacity chips in commercial use hold 4million bits of information.   A bit is the smallest piece of information processed by acomputer, and can be thought of as the digits 1 or 0. It representsan electrical switch either being turned on or off.   A 16-million-bit chip can store the equivalent of about 1,600pages of double-spaced, typewritten text.   International Business Machines Corp. announced just last Junethat it had started commercial production of the 4-million-bit chip.   IBM spokesman Paul Bergevin said the company, based in Armonk,N.Y., has been researching 16-million-bit chips for several years.The company said it recently began producing the chips on a trialbasis at its semiconductor plant in Essex Junction, Vt., on anexisting chip assembly line.   Bergevin said commercial, volume production of the new chipcould be 18 months to two years away. All the chips IBM makes areused in its own computers.   Other companies are known to be working on 16-million-bit chips,but none so far has announced production, Bergevin said.   Last month, IBM announced that it had entered into a jointventure with Siemens AG, the large West Germany electronicscompany, to develop a 64-million-bit chip, which would be the nextgereration of chips. Because of the way chips are constructed,advances usually take place in intervals of four times greatercapacity than the previous generation.</TEXT></DOC>
