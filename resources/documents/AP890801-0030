North the right to sue forit,'' Hinchman noted.   North's lawyer, Brendan Sullivan, had no immediate comment onthe ruling, a secretary said late Monday afternoon.   North was sentenced July 5 to 1,200 hours of community serviceand fined $150,000 for his conviction on charges of aiding andabetting an obstruction of Congress, accepting an illegal gratuityand altering or destroying classified documents.   The Navy said then that it was suspending the pension Northearned during 20 years in the Marine Corps, but that it wouldrecommend the pension be reinstated.   ``We're aware of the (GAO) opinion,'' said Navy Lt. Cmdr. CraigQuigley. ``We keep going back to our Navy Department recommendationthat it should be continued.''   Federal law says a custodian who destroys government documentsforfeits his public office.   The Navy's judge advocate general, Everette Stumbaugh, concludedthat North, as a retiree, doesn't hold office and that North'spension should be continued.   However, Navy general counsel Lawrence Lamade said that North,as a retired Marine Corps officer, holds a U.S. office, at leastfor some purposes.   Quigley said the comptroller general's decision doesn't affectother benefits that come with North's position, such as commissaryand exchange privileges, medical benefits and the right to carry acard identifying himself as a retired military officer.</TEXT></DOC>
