Becor, a South Milwaukee, Wis.-based mining equipment maker, is the target of four takeover attempts, including one by a management-led group. In recent weeks, the suitors have issued a string of complex proposals and revised bids involving cash, debt and securities that are difficult to value.    As previously reported, some of the earlier proposals have been valued from $238.1 million to about $255 million.    Becor, which hired First Boston Corp. as its investment adviser to help it value the offers, said its directors met yesterday to review the bids.    Under the revised offer, Davis offered Becor holders $16.50 in cash for each share or $13 face amount of debentures, $5 in preferred stock, and 1 1/8 shares of common stock in the surviving company. Becor said the cash or securities would be paid for as much as 55% of the shares outstanding.    Davis, a Coeburn, Va.-based coal mining and explosives company, previously said it would pay $10.45 in cash and $3.50 in 12.5% debentures for each Becor share.    Yesterday, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Becor closed at $15.125, up 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
