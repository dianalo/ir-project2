DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hispanic immigrants register to vote at asignificantly higher rate than most Americans and are ``almost upfor grabs'' by both Republicans and Democrats because many have notdecided which party they favor, a Latino group said in announcingresults of a survey Thursday.   The telephone survey of 1,635 immigrants from 17 nations showedthat 81 percent of the naturalized immigrants are registered tovote, compared with 70 percent of the general U.S. voting agepopulation, the National Association of Latino Elected and AppointedOfficials said.   Forty-nine percent of those interviewed, all of whom were eithernaturalized citizens or legal permanent residents of the UnitedStates, said they had ``no preference'' between the major U.S.political parties.   ``This is a large population that is almost up for grabs,'' saidRep. Edward Roybal, D-Calif., president of the association'seducational fund, which conducted the survey.   ``Republicans and Democrats have an open field to go out into theLatin community and convince them that their party and platform isthe best,'' said Roybal, a Hispanic from a Los Angeles district withthe heaviest concentration of Hispanics in his state.   He said the Southwest, and California in particular, ``will havea vast reservoir of people who haven't made their minds up yet, butthey do register.''   ``Despite the myths of the past, they will be registering in highnumbers and will be getting out to the polls in high numbers,''Roybal said.   The study gave no overall figure on the number of Hispanicimmigrants in the United States, but said more than one-and-a-halfmillion have legally entered the country in the past decade and theywill soon be the largest ethnic minority in the country.   A study in April by the Center for Political Studies at theUniversity of Michigan showed that among Hispanic citizens who hadmade a choice, 63 percent of Cubans considered themselvesRepublicans, 9 percent Democrats, 13 percent independents and 16percent no preference.   The corresponding figures for Mexican immigrants were 42 percentDemocrat, 16 percent Republican, 10 percent independent and 33percent no preference. For immigrants from other Latin Americancountries, the figures were 34 percent Democrat, 28 percentRepublican, 10 percent independent and 27 percent no preference.   The numbers don't add up to exactly 100 percent because ofrounding.   Twenty-seven per cent said they had attended politicalfund-raisers or contributed money, 9 percent had written letters onpolitical issues and an equal percentage had taken part incanvassing or marching. Five percent said they had distributedpolitical literature and 4 percent said they had helped peopleregister or vote.   Roybal said he believed the survey indicates that more Hispanicswill be elected to office ``in years to come, perhaps after the year2000.''   He said political participation by Hispanics would give themleverage to help prevent state legislatures from drawingcongressional district lines, after the 1990 census, that are``gerrymandered to keep them out.''   Results of the survey are particularly important ``because thisis a group that many believe will not be fully counted in the nextcensus,'' Roybal said.   The survey also showed that 95 percent of those responding saidan important reason for wanting to become a U.S. citizen is that itallows you to vote.   The survey was conducted in California, Texas, Florida, New York,New Jersey, Illinois, Arizona and Maryland. Nearly half of thoseinterviewed were from Mexico and one-fourth from Cuba. The principalother countries of origin included the Dominican Republic, Colombia,El Salvador and Ecuador.   The association claims a membership of more than 3,300 Hispanicelected officials, appointed officials and community and businessleaders. It did not give a margin of error for its survey.</TEXT></DOC>
