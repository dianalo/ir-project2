According to the study issued Sunday by the Washington-basedCrime Control Institute, 14 officers were killed in drug enforcementactivities such as raids, arrests and serving warrants, includingone who was assassinated in New York.   By contrast, killings of police officers have averaged seven ayear since 1972, when the FBI began publishing narratives on howpolice officers died in the line of duty.   By another measure, the proportion of all police murdersattributable to drugs has risen from 6 percent in 1985 to 18 percentin 1988, the report said.   University of Maryland Professor Lawrence W. Sherman, who alsoheads the institute, said part of the reason for the increase is theincreased drug enforcement activity.   Estimated drug arrests have set a record each year since reaching708,000 in 1984, rising to 1.1 million in 1988, Sherman said. Thenumbers of police murders per drug arrest rose from .71 to 100,000in 1984 to 1.22 per 100,000 in 1988.   The all-time record rate of drug arrest-related police killingswas in 1976, when 1.96 officers died per 100,000 arrests, followedby 1980 when there were 1.89 police killings for every 100,000 drugarrests.   ``While the risk of death per arrest is still not as high as inthe record years of 1976 and 1980, this trend is still an ominousone,'' the study said. ``The record levels of drug enforcement,combined with rising risk levels per arrest, suggest that the totalmurders of police in drug enforcement will increase in futureyears.''   Putting the risk in perspective, the report noted that officerswho make two drug arrests a day, 220 days a year, for 25 years willmake only 5,500 drug arrests.   ``Career drug arrests may total, on average, less than 100 forthe typical officer,'' it said. ``At these levels of drugenforcement activity, odds of one death per 100,000 drug arrests arepretty safe bets.''   Of the killings since 1972, 33 percent happened during undercover``buy and bust'' operations, 32 percent while serving warrants orconducting raids, and 5 percent were ``ambushed'' duringsurveillance or killed to prevent their testimony.   Referring to the ambush killings, the report said: ``These casesare a mere handful compared to the 220 judges and other courtofficials slain in Colombia, apparently by drug dealers, since 1981.But it is striking that four out of six of these U.S. cases occurredin the period from 1985 through 1988.''   The study did not count killings outside drug enforcement even ifthe killer was under the influence of drugs, was a known or pastdrug dealer or in possession of drugs.   Additionally, the report did not mention non-fatal injuries toofficers.</TEXT></DOC>
