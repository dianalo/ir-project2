One hundred andtwenty-five of them to be exact, and Joel Garreau gives thema name and a biography in &quot;Edge City: Life on the NewFrontier&quot; (Doubleday, 546 pages, $22.50).   Mr. Garreau's edge cities have such unfamiliar anduninviting names as &quot;the Cumberland Mall-Galleria area&quot; (nearAtlanta), the Interstate &quot;287 andamp; 78&quot; region (in New Jersey),and &quot;the 44th Street-Sky Harbor Airport area&quot; (in Phoenix).They are so new that nobody (including the author) has comeup with a good name for them yet. Most have popped up duringthe past 20 years where shopping malls, hotels, office parksand residential areas have clustered near the intersection ofmajor highways. No longer are these simply places we drivethrough on the way to someplace else, insists Mr. Garreau, asenior writer at the Washington Post and author of &quot;The NineNations of North America&quot; (1982). They have, he shows throughsuperb reporting, &quot;all the complexity, diversity and size ofa downtown.&quot; In fact, each of his edge cities has more retailand office space than downtown Tampa or Portland, Ore. Edgecities, in his view, represent the urban future, and thatfuture looks pretty bright to him.</LP><TEXT>   Readers who equate cities with sidewalks and symphoniesare bound to gag on that proposition. From behind the wheelof a speeding automobile, edge cities seem less like a uniquenew urban form than the latest product of the great suburbancookie cutter. The argument ended on a happy note for me afew years ago, when Manhattan's Carnegie Delicatessen, one ofthe shrines of traditional urbanism, opened its first branch-- in the Northern Virginia edge city of Tysons Corner, notfar from my home. What is not clear, and what Mr. Garreaufails to demonstrate, is whether these boom towns are justsatellites, like the Tysons Corner Carnegie, or independenteconomic entities.   But they clearly are frontiers. The edge cities arecreating many of the nation's new jobs and new technologies,as well as a new way of life. Mr. Garreau takes therefreshing view that the Americans who flock there must be onto something, not that they need to have their headsexamined. The edge city, he believes, is our latest attemptto find a balance between urban energy and rural serenity --a new way to live together, not, as so many critics have it,apart. Edge cities have neighborhoods, local institutions andeven eccentricities, just like &quot;real&quot; places. It's just thatthings are more spread out. You have to know where to findthem.   The secret to the edge cities' success, Mr. Garreau says,is the reign of market forces. Developers &quot;can and do reducemuch of human experience -- quite accurately, as it turns out-- to the Deal.&quot; Mr. Garreau is at his best when he isuncovering the unwritten laws of the Deal that dictate muchof the edge cities' shape. For instance, developers proceedin the knowledge that true Americans will not walk more than600 feet before getting into their cars, and operate on thecalculation that parking an automobile takes 400 square feet.Reading &quot;Edge City,&quot; we understand why so much of thelandscape around us looks the way it does.   Mr. Garreau also explains why it is that so many peoplelive in densely packed townhouse developments &quot;out in themiddle of nowhere&quot; and off the far exits of the interstates.These townhouses are, he writes, today's worker housing,built for the white- and pink-collar proletariat of theinformation age. &quot;If you look at them closely, you realizethat what they are, architecturally, is tenements flippedover on their sides. Instead of stacking single flats one ontop of another, now we rotate our worker housing 90 degreesand pack it side by side by side.&quot;   I wish Mr. Garreau had grappled more successfully withsome of the edge cities' problems. He makes a strong casethat edge cities are not racially segregated, but concedeswithout comment that they are segregated by class. He alsocould have pointed out that those townhouse developments arebound to go the way of the last century's worker housing,into the hands of the less well-off. And what about traffic?Right in Mr. Garreau's (and my) backyard is the edge city ofTysons Corner, whose nightmarish traffic makes even devotededge-city dwellers wonder about their chosen way of life.   Mr. Garreau is rightly skeptical of architects, designersand urban planners, who have given little but contempt to theedge cities. But his belief that a livable future depends ondevelopers and citizens reaching an accord is too slim ahope. They are not, after all, free agents. Zoning codes,highway-department regulations and other governmentalephemera shape the edge cities every bit as much as thedevelopers' golden rules do.   But as Mr. Garreau keeps reminding the reader, the edgecities are a frontier where much is still taking shape andmany things seem possible. His book is the best guide to itthat we are likely to have for some time.   ---   Mr. Lagerfeld is deputy editor of the Wilson Quarterly.</TEXT></DOC>
