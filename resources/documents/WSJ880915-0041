Harrison, president and chief executive officer of Public Service Co. of New Hampshire whose tenure has been marred by the controversial Seabrook nuclear power plant, is expected to resign today because of medical problems.    He will be succeeded by John Duffett, 60 years old, currently chief operating officer and executive vice president at the troubled utility, according to a person close to the company. William J. Scharffenberger, 67, an outside director, will be elected to the now vacant position of chairman, the person added.    Mr. Harrison's resignation isn't expected to have any effect on the company's efforts to fashion a financial reorganization, the person emphasized. Last January, PS of New Hamsphire became the first major utility in some 50 years to file for bankruptcy-court protection from its creditors, because it couldn't meet interest payments on its huge debt related to Seabrook, in which its holds a 35.6% stake.    Mr. Harrison, 56, who in 1983 had two heart-bypass operations, was advised by his doctor to retire after recent tests showed him &quot;very vulnerable&quot; to stress, the person close to the company said. Mr. Harrison couldn't be reached for comment. He has been president since 1981 and chief executive since 1983.    Mr. Duffett, who joined the company in 1954 and became chief operating officer in 1986, has been in charge of the utility's day-to-day operations. Mr. Scharffenberger, who was named a director in 1985 because of his experience in corporate reorganizations, is president and chief executive of Wheeling Pittsburgh Corp.    PS of New Hampshire's problems stem from the Seabrook plant, which is completed but hasn't been started because of a furor over emergency evacuation plans. Company officials blame the plant's problems -- and the utility's bankruptcy-law filing -- on anti-nuclear politics that have delayed the nuclear facility. But critics say that Mr. Harrison and company executives are to blame. Work on the plant began in 1976, and was hampered by rising costs. PS of New Hampshire took on far too high a share of the nuclear plant for a company its size, critics contend, and insisted on pushing forward as problems mounted.    The company and New Hampshire officials are currently negotiating a rate increase that could be the basis of a reorganization plan, but the two sides in the past have been far apart. PS of New Hamsphire has threatened in court documents to seek federal regulation -- and thus bypass state regulatory authorities -- if a sufficient rate increase isn't granted.    Mr. Harrison is leaving at a time when some supporters think progress is being made toward getting Seabrook started. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is expected tomorrow to ease rules regarding emergency-warning systems, thus clearing the way to license the plant for a low-power test. However, such a move likely will be challenged in court by Seabrook opponents. </TEXT></DOC>
