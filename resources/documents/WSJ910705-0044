Butgovernment officials say they remain committed to BritishRail's eventual privatization, now under study by a team ofcivil servants and private consultants.   Reporting results for its year ended March 31, 1991,British Rail announced a deficit of #10.9 million ($17.5million), compared with a profit of #270 million in 1989-90.</LP><TEXT>   After decades of cutbacks and inadequate investment,almost the only thing favoring British Rail is the growingrealization that rail transport is the only way of beatingworsening congestion on Britain's overcrowded road network.But though Transport Secretary Malcolm Rifkind has pledgedthe government to British Rail's eventual privatization,there's no agreement yet on how this should be effected.   What's more, British Rail Chairman Sir Bob Reid insisted,financial targets set for British Rail by the government needto be relaxed. Asked at a news conference what effect hethought the latest losses, after three years of profit, wouldhave on the government's privatization plans, he said he had&quot;no idea.&quot;   Ironically, announcement of the losses came only a dayafter the unveiling of an ambitious #1.5 billion scheme tobuild a new rail route across London, imitating Paris'ssuccessful RER network. The so-called CrossRail scheme, ifapproved by Parliament, would take British Rail trains underthe center of London for the first time and could be inoperation by 1999.   But the plan will come too late for many of the millionsof rail users who currently suffer daily from delays andcancelations. During 1990-91, British Rail's punctualityrecord improved only marginally, with 15% of London rush-hourtrains arriving more than five minutes late.   Almost the only bright spot, from the commuter's point ofview, was an improvement in cleanliness: During 1990-91, 81%of commuter trains got cleaned inside and outside daily,compared with 77% in 1889-90.   Sir Bob, the BR chairman, blamed the 1990-91 loss onBritain's economic recession.   Earnings on property sales and letting slumped during theyear to #223 million from #412 million, he said, whilepassenger traffic grew at a slower rate than predicted.   In recent months, he noted, redundancies in London-basedbusinesses had taken a heavy toll on commuter traffic, withdemands for refunds on annual season tickets still coming in.   Nonetheless, Sir Bob insisted, things could have beenworse. &quot;The main message is that the operating railway hasperformed very well in difficult economic conditions,&quot; hesaid. &quot;In a way, it has been an outstanding year'sperformance.&quot;   BR officials say they expect outline proposals for therail network's privatization to form part of a ConservativeParty manifesto for upcoming parliamentary elections, duesome time within the next 12 months.   But the government still has to decide whether to sellBritish Rail off wholesale or break it up along sectoral orregional lines.   Meantime, large-scale investments under way to improvesafety are likely to produce another deficit for British Railthis year. In addition, Transport Department officialsconcede, heavy subsidies will go on being needed with orwithout privatization to keep loss-making local servicesrunning. The 1990-91 loss was after subsidies from thecentral government and local authorities of #699.9 million,up from #586.8 million in the previous 12 months. Governmentsubsidies during the current financial year are expected tototal around #740 million.</TEXT></DOC>
