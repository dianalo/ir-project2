Prosecutors contend even celebrities paid up to $2,000 a day forthe sex services. In exchange, the high-priced prostitutes lived ajet-set life, following elite customers to Paris, London, Geneva,New York and Las Vegas.   When vice officers crashed her West Coast prostitution ring lastyear, Elizabeth Adams at first denied she was a police informant.Later, she recanted, saying she manned an inside pipeline for 16years.   ``Four of my girls married into very prominent families,'' Ms.Adams once said, refusing to name names. ``They're so polished.These people improved their lives thanks to me.''   Detective Alan Vanderpool described her service as the best.Vice Capt. James Docherty portrayed Ms. Adams as ``a multibuck,big-time madam.''   Ms. Adams began working with police in 1972 and relayed to theminformation her call girls gleaned from their clients, she said incourt papers. Her lawyer said she should be shielded fromprosecution, or at least kept from incarceration, in exchange forher work as an informant.   Ms. Adams, 56, allegedly told police about people who wereinvolved in prostitution rings, along with firearms and narcoticstrade.   Police allege a Saudi prince once ordered a ski companion forhis son through Ms. Adams. Most clients, however, were known onlyby code name.   A motion to dismiss the case of the Beverly Hills Madam is to beheard Dec. 1 in Superior Court. Deputy District Attorney AlanCarter said he is prepared to prosecute Ms. Adams on two felonycounts of pimping and pandering.   The charges carry a maximum of seven years in prison.   She became known as the Beverly Hills Madam because many peoplealleged to be clients booked their trysts in posh Beverly Hillshotel suites.   Defense attorney Anthony P. Brooklier claims the case should bedismissed because police encouraged Ms. Adams to continue her workand provide the department with inside information garnered in her``pillow talk network.''   ``For some reason, when it's sack time, (men) makerevelations,'' she was quoted as saying last year by the LosAngeles Times. The women ``hear things that the State Departmentwould give its eye teeth for.''   Carter said in a recent interview he couldn't discuss the case.   Ms. Adams, also known as Alex Fleming, was a police agent and``officers should be bound by their promises that she would not beprosecuted, or at a minimum, that the defendant not beincarcerated,'' Brooklier argued.   Ms. Adams, freed on $210,000 bail after being charged last year,declined through Brooklier to be interviewed. And he refused todisclose where she was living.   In a declaration submitted to the court, Ms. Adams said shestarted working with police in 1972 following her arrest onpandering charges. For her cooperation, those charges were dropped.   Deputy District Attorney Pamela Ferrero said last year that Ms.Adams' police record included one felony conviction, onemisdemeanor guilty plea, fines and probation from fourprostitution-related arrests since 1972.   Officials ``were well aware of my activities,'' Ms. Adams wrotein court documents. She also said that because of her policeconnections, she was severely beaten twice and requiredhospitalization for her injuries.   ``The information I provided led to the arrest and conviction ofnumerous offenders over a 16-year period. In return, the lawenforcement officials have agreed to protect me against anyprosecution which would lead to incarceration for my activities,''Ms. Adams told the court.   Retired police Sgt. Glenn R. Souza stated in an affidavit thatMs. Adams was identified in the 1970s as an agent for thedepartment by a U.S. Senate subcommittee.   He corroborated Ms. Adams' statement about the beatings and saidshe ``assisted detectives with information regarding numerousfelony cases in the areas of prostitution, firearms, narcotics andother larcenous violations.''   Souza said Ms. Adams assisted police from 1972 to 1982, butBrooklier maintains the help continued until her arrest in 1988.   Her enterprise unraveled when a former cook, Russell Lucas, wentto police, who sent in a young undercover policewoman to aninterview with Ms. Adams.   ``It's just like going on a date but you get paid for it. Younever made money like this in your life,'' Ms. Adams told theofficer in a tape-recorded interview on Feb. 29, 1988. ``Get apassport. Paris, Geneva, you get to see the world.''   For fees of $150 an hour, Ms. Adams' employees would dine atfine restaurants and take cruises to the Bahamas. She would keep$400 of each $1,000 made, allegedly taking in about $100,000 amonth.   Ms. Adams came from Manila 20 years ago. She worked as a floristand antique shop owner. She said she was a mother and a widow whenshe was approached by an ``English madam'' who offered her a clientbook.</TEXT></DOC>
