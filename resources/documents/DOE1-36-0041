The 5-acre site is a decommissioned wood-preservingfacility which operated between 1963 and 1985. PWP began operating in1963 using a fluoride-chromate arsenate-phenol (FCAP) and an acid-copper-chromate(ACC) process. In 1980, Eastern Forest Products took over and switchedto a chromate-copper-arsenate (CCA) process. Operations consisted ofimpregnating wood with a CCA solution under high pressure, and allowingthe wood to drip-dry under normal conditions. Beginning in December 1981,the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC)received complaints of green liquids running off the PWP site duringheavy rainfall. Subsequent soil sampling conducted by SCDHEC indicatedthe presence of high concentrations of chromium. Pentachlorophenol (PCP)and dinitrophenol residues were also detected. Well-water sampling showedno evidence of contamination. In April 1983, a private well was foundto contain high levels of chromium and copper. As a result of the findings,SCDHEC issued a Consent Order requesting Palmetto Wood Preserving todetermine the extent of soil and ground water contamination. Primarycontaminants of concern include chromium and arsenic.</TEXT></DOC>
