The Secretaryof the Interior (Secretary) may open refuge areas to hunting and/or fishingupon a determination that such uses are compatible with the major purpose(s)for which each refuge was established, and that funds are available fordevelopment, operation, and maintenance of a hunting or fishing program.The action must also be in accordance with provisions of all laws applicableto the areas, must be consistent with the principles of sound fish andwildlife management, and must otherwise be in the public interest. Thisrulemaking opens five refuges to hunting and two to sport fishing. Refuge-specificregulations for these refuges are contained in separate rulemaking documentson refuge-specific hunting and fishing regulations. On May 6, 1988, at 53 FR 16296, the Service published a proposed rule toopen five NWRs to hunting and two to sport fishing. Department of the Interiorpolicy is, whenever practicable, to afford the public an opportunity toparticipate in the rulemaking process. Accordingly, written comments receivedon the proposed rule are addressed in the following section. <ITAG tagnum="84">Responses to Comments Received </ITAG>Written comments on the proposed rule were received from 43 parties. Severalcomments were similar or identical to those received on previous proposedrulemakings opening refuges to hunting and/or fishing contending genericallythat hunting on refuges is illegal, not in the spirit for which refugesare created, violates the Endangered Species Act, or is not in compliancewith the National Environmental Policy Act or various other laws or regulations.These issues have been addressed by the Service, see <T3>e.q.</T3>, 51 FR 30655 of August 28, 1986, the final rule opening sevenrefuges to hunting and 11 to sport fishing, and the Service will not hererepeat its responses given in that rulemaking. Substantive comments on issues not already addressed in hunting and fishingplans, Environmental Assessments or Section 7 Endangered Species Act consultations(all of which were available for public review during the comment period)are responded to below: <T3>Issue:</T3> While some parties categorically supported or opposed huntingper se, some took literal issue with the idea of hunting on a ``refuge.''<T3>Response:</T3> NWRs are not established for the protection of individualmembers of each species; moreover, NWRs are established for a variety ofpurposes other than strict protection of wildlife. Each individual nationalwildlife refuge must be managed primarily for the major purpose(s) forwhich it was established. Such purposes may include providing for environmentaleducation, the protection of hardwood forests, designated bird speciesor endangered species, or providing fish and wildlife oriented recreationincluding but not limited to bird watching, fishing or hunting. By law(see <T3>Conformance with Statutory and Regulatory Authorities</T3> below) anyarea may be used for any purpose when determined compatible with the majorpurposes for which it was established. As a form of recreation to almost17 million people, hunting, when compatible with refuge purposes is consideredto be a valid activity that is often the only practical form of populationcontrol for some species, notably big game. <T3>Issue:</T3> The frequency, duration, extent or manner of deer huntingon the Supawna Meadows NWR in New Jersey was commented upon most frequently,including thoughtful and substantive comments by Congressman William J.Hughes of the Second District of New Jersey. <T3>Response:</T3> The data obtained from the first-time hunt, togetherwith that from field work, will form the basis upon which State and Servicebiologists will evaluate the degree to which the objectives of the huntwere met and upon which to make future recommendations. <T3>Issue:</T3> The New Jersey refuge deer hunts should be substantialenough (not token) to reduce or eliminate crop and landscape depredationsand automobile accidents in the surrounding areas. <T3>Response:</T3> While the refuge hunter density of one hunter per 25acres (1/25) is not nearly as dense as the 1/15 sometimes permitted elsewherein the State, the Service believes refuge hunting program objectives willbe met. This conservative hunter density is thought prudent for this first-timeopening and will provide baseline data upon which to make future recommendations.<T3>Issue:</T3> Several residents in the vicinity of the Supawna MeadowsNWR commented that high deer populations on the refuge caused extensiveeconomic damage to crops, landscaping and home gardens as well as numerousautomobile accidents. <T3>Response:</T3> One objective of the Supawna Meadows NWR hunt is ``tomaintain the deer population at a level compatible with refuge habitat.''<T3>Issue:</T3> Reducing deer will reduce the number of deer ticks andthe threat of Lyme disease. <T3>Response:</T3> Deer ticks (<T3>Ixodes dammini</T3>) inhabit a variety of hosts, the white-footed mousein particular. The argument that reducing deer numbers will reduce thethreat of Lyme disease to humans cannot be supported by the literaturecurrently available. <ITAG tagnum="81">Conformance With Statutory and Regulatory Authorities </ITAG>The National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966, as amended(NWRSAA) (16 U.S.C. 668dd), and the Refuge Recreation Act (RRA) of 1962(16 U.S.C. 460k) govern the administration and public use of national wildliferefuges. Specifically, section 4(d)(1)(A) of the NWRSAA authorizes theSecretary to permit the use of any area within the Refuge System for anypurpose, including but not limited to hunting, fishing, public recreationand accommodations, and access, when he determines that such uses are compatiblewith the major purposes for which each refuge was established. The Secretaryadministers the Refuge System through the Service. The RRA gives the Secretary additional authority to administer refuge areaswithin the Refuge System for public recreation as an appropriate incidentalor secondary use only to the extent that it is practicable and not inconsistentwith the primary purposes for which the refuges were established. In addition,prior to opening refuges to hunting or fishing under this Act, the Secretaryis required to determine that funds are available for the development,operation, and maintenance of these permitted forms of recreation. In accordance with the NWRSAA and the RRA, the Secretary has determinedthat the hunting and fishing openings described below will be compatibleand consistent with the primary purposes for which each of the refugeslisted was established, and that funds are available to administer theseprograms. The hunting and fishing programs will be within State and Federal(migratory game bird) regulatory frameworks. A discussion of the compatibilityof the hunting and fishing programs with the purpose(s) for which eachrefuge was established and the availability of funding for each program,was discussed in the proposed rule, referenced above. <ITAG tagnum="84">Economic Effect </ITAG>Executive Order 12291, ``Federal Regulation,'' of February 17, 1981, requiresthe preparation of regulatory impact analyses for major rules. A majorrule is one likely to result in an annual effect on the economy of $100million or more; a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, government agencies or geographic regions; or significant adverseeffects on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete withforeign-based enterprises. The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C.601 <T3>et seq.</T3>) further requires the preparation of flexibility analysesfor rules that will have a significant effect on a substantial number ofsmall entities, which include small businesses, organizations or governmentaljurisdictions. It is estimated that opening these refuges to hunting and fishing willgenerate approximately 71,550 annual visits. Using data from the 1980 NationalSurvey of Hunting, Fishing, and Wildlife-Associated Recreation, and the1987 Economic Report of the President (Consumer Price Index), total annualreceipts generated from purchases of food, transportation, hunting andfishing equipment, fees, and licenses associated with these programs areexpected to be approximately $2,406,429 or substantially less than $100million. In addition, since these estimated receipts will be spread overseveral States, the implementation of this rule should not have a significanteconomic impact on the overall economy, or a particular region, industryor group of industries, or level of government. With respect to small entities, this rule would have a positive aggregateeconomic effect on small businesses, organizations, and governmental jurisdictions.These openings will provide recreational opportunities and generate economicbenefits that may not now exist, and will impose no new costs on smallentities. While the number of small entities likely to be affected is notknown, the number is judged to be small. Moreover, the added cost to theFederal Government of law enforcement, posting, etc., needed to implementactivities under this rule would be considerably less than the income generatedfrom the implementation of these hunting and/or sport fishing programs.Accordingly, the Department of the Interior has determined that this ruleis not a ``major rule'' within the meaning of Executive Order 12291 andwill not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number ofsmall entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The Service has approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)for the information collection requirements of these regulations pursuantto the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). These requirementsare presently approved by OMB as cited below: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,10 </C>  <H1>Type of information collection </H1><H1>OMB approved No. </H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Economic and public use permits <D>1018-0014 </D></ITAG></ITAG> These regulations impose no new reporting or recordkeeping requirementsthat must be cleared by OMB. <ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Considerations</ITAG>The ``Final Environmental Statement for the Operation of the National WildlifeRefuge System'' [FES 76-59] was filed with the Council on EnvironmentalQuality on November 12, 1976; a notice of availability was published inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4> on November 19, 1976 [41 FR 51131]. Pursuantto the requirements of section 102(2)(C) of the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act of 1969 [42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C), environmental assessments (EAs)were prepared for these refuge openings. Based upon the EAs, the Serviceissued Findings of No Significant Impact with respect to the openings.Section 7 evaluations were prepared, where appropriate, pursuant to theEndangered Species Act.In view of the rapidly approaching hunting seasons, there is an immediateneed to place these regulations into effect. It is Service policy to conducthunting within the framework of State laws, regulations and seasons. Todelay opening the refuges to hunting may cause confusion to the public,deny a benefit to the public and small related businesses and would notbe in the best interest of the Service or the public. Thus the Departmentof the Interior concludes that good cause exists within the meaning of5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3) of the Administrative Procedures Act to make these regulationseffective upon publication in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4><ITAG tagnum="84">Primary Author</ITAG>Larry LaRochelle, Division of Refuges, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,Washington, DC, is the primary author of this rulemaking document.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>50 CFR Part 32Hunting, National Wildlife Refuge System, Wildlife, Wildlife refuges.50 CFR Part 33Fishing, National Wildlife Refuge System, Wildlife refuges.Accordingly, Parts 32 and 33 of Chapter I Title 50 of the <T3>Code of Federal Regulations</T3> are amended as set forth below:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 32_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
