(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The paternal grandparents of a baby bornand abandoned in an airplane restroom will be allowed to keep thechild in their New York home but the court will retain legalcustody of the infant, a court ruled Friday.   A San Mateo County juvenile court judge said 3-month-old AlyssaLoCasto will remain with her grandparents in the New York Cityborough of Staten Island. The baby has been living with hergrandparents, John and Frances LoCasto, since August.   The infant was found abandoned in the restroom of an airplaneafter it landed at San Francisco International Airport on July 13.   The child's mother, Christina LoCasto, 24, who turned herself inthe next day, gave birth secretly just before the flight leftNewark, N.J., and has pleaded innocent to a charge of felony childendangerment.   Christina LoCasto and her husband, Louis LoCasto, also of StatenIsland, had been having domestic problems when Alyssa was conceivedand the father did not know his wife had been pregnant or had givenbirth just before the flight, authorities said.   Each parent will be allowed to visit their daughter under thesupervision of a Department of Social Services official for sixhours per week. The visitation hours were increased from one hour aweek.   The court also ordered the couple to continue in counseling andrequired SanMateo and New York authorities to provide services withthe goal of reuniting the family.   The parents may file to regain custody of the child, the courtsaid, but that is unlikely for at least a year, said an attorneyrepresenting Louis LoCasto.   No family members attended the hearing Friday and the custodyarrangement will be reviewed Jan. 20.   The couple retained custody of their two older children, aged 6and 21 months.   Christina LoCasto's trial is scheduled to begin Oct. 31. Ifconvicted, she could face up to six years in prison. She is free on$50,000 bail.</TEXT></DOC>
