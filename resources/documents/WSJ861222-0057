More than a third of last month's increase reflected rising prices for new cars and an increase in auto financing charges, according to the Labor Department report. Consumer prices rose 0.2% in October.    The November figures come toward the end of a year in which falling oil prices have held the overall inflation rate to just a little more than 1%, the lowest annual rate since 1964. Many analysts look for a 3% to 4% rate next year, as oil prices stabilize, but few foresee an acceleration in prices to annual rates beyond 4%.    &quot;The report confirms the fact that inflation is proceeding at a moderate rate, and that's good news,&quot; said Lyle Gramley, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association. &quot;I would expect that to persist through all of 1987.&quot;    New car prices increased 0.9% in November after a 0.8% rise in October. Auto financing charges rose sharply for the second consecutive month, reflecting a rebound from the discount financing offered in September. Joel Popkin, a Washington-based consultant, says he doesn't expect car prices to rise much next year, however.    The November price rise equaled a 3.3% annual rate after compounding, compared with a 1.8% rate in October. Excluding food and energy prices, the two most volatile components of the price index, consumer prices were up 0.3% in November following a 0.4% rise the month before. Energy prices fell 0.7%, which was less steep than the 2.2% drop in October, while food and beverage prices rose 0.5% after climbing 0.3% the previous month. All the figures are adjusted for seasonal variation.    Before adjustment, the consumer price index for all urban consumers rose 0.1% in November to 330.8% of its 1967 average; it was 1.3% above a year earlier.    The index for urban wage earners and clerical workers, a measure that includes half the number of people covered by the all-urban index and is used in adjusting Social Security and other retirement benefits, rose an unadjusted 0.1% to 325.4% of its 1967 average, and was 0.9% above a year earlier.    Separately, the Labor Department said the average weekly earnings of U.S. workers rose a strong 0.8% in November, after adjustment for inflation and seasonal factors, following a rise of 0.2% the previous month. The big increase reflected a combination of a 0.6% rise in hours worked and a 0.5% rise in average hourly earnings, before inflation adjustment.    The average weekly earnings of U.S. workers totaled $308.52 in November, after adjustment for seasonal factors but not inflation, up from $305.36 the previous month.    ---   Here are the seasonally adjusted changes in the components of the Labor Department's consumer price index for November.                                     % change from                                  Oct.
