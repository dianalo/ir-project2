The plan by Cambridge, Mass., architect Eduardo Catalano,includes a large, central open space surrounded by a tree-shapedpromenade, said Paul A. Spreiregen, a Washington architect whoserved on the selection panel and who also directed the designcompetition for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.   The plan, announced Wednesday, also includes a glass-enclosedvisitor's center and a natural ampitheatre on a 12-acre site atHains Point near the Jefferson Memorial.   ``I see Washington as a city of monuments,'' said Elizabeth M.Ratcliff, the former Berkeley, Calif., English teacher whooriginally proposed the idea. ``We have the great museums that tellus about our literary and scientific achievements, great houses ofgovernment and monuments which witness the sacrifices that peoplehave made to keep our country alive.   ``It just seemed to me that among those symbols should be _there had to be _ something which said something about thefuture,'' she said.   Catalano's design was among 930 proposals.   Rep. George Miller, D-Cal., introduced the National PeaceMonument bill in March 1986. Former President Reagan signed themeasure into law in June 1987.   Of the estimated $6 million cost for the gardens, more than$300,000 dollars has been raised so far, Ms. Ratcliff said.   According to the law, the project must be completed by 1992 orthe entire legislative process must be repeated.   The gardens will be composed of seven large leaf forms, each ofwhich will be bordered by paved pathways that will enable visitorsto walk from leaf to leaf.   The curvilinear paths join where the leaves meet each other,forming the spine of the olive branch. Circular planters will beplaced between the leaves, where their stem forms to create themain branch.   The leaf forms will consist of a variety of low ground coversextending about a foot high, and will ``form a rich, varied andintricate texture,'' Spreiregen said.</TEXT></DOC>
