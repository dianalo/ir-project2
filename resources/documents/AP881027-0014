SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A money shortage is threatening the NationalWeather Service less than a month into the government's new fiscalyear, although officials say no decision has been made on whether toclose offices.   An employee union said Wednesday it had obtained information fromthe Commerce Department, parent agency of the weather service,indicating that as many as 40 weather offices could be in jeopardy.   Weather Service spokesman Donald Witten confirmed that the agencyis facing financial problems and said many options are beingconsidered for saving money. He said no decisions have been made onany closings.   A recently approved pay raise for federal workers, coupled withbudget cutbacks, is expected to leave the weather service about $25million short of its needs for the fiscal year that started Oct. 1.   ``Basically, we're looking at the operation and seeing what wecan do to meet that shortfall,'' Witten said in a telephoneinterview.   ``Obviously the sooner you do it in the fiscal year the better,but the fact is we haven't decided on any specific reductions atthis time. We're looking at a lot of options,'' he said.   Witten said the Weather Service has instituted a hiring freezeand is considering offering early retirement to employees who may beeligible to leave before the normal retirement age, as immediateways to save money. Salaries are by far the largest item in theagency's budget.   The National Weather Service Employees Organization issued astatement claiming that plans have been drafted to close as many as40 of the 191 weather offices.   Such a series of closings could have a serious impact onforecasting, particularly affecting airline operations, the groupsaid.   The Weather Service offices collect hourly observations, whichare transmitted to the National Meteorological Center in Suitland,Md., where a national forecast is developed. That is then sent tolocal forecast offices, which use it along with their localobservations to issue local weather forecasts and alerts.   This is not the first time Weather Service offices have beenthreatened with closings in efforts to save money. Each time,however, Congress has voted money to keep the offices open.   Among the weather data collection offices that may be threatened,according to the employees group, are:   Eastern region: Mansfield, Ohio; Elkins, W.Va.; Reading, Pa.;Lynchburg, Va.; Parkersburg, W.Va.   Central region: Alamosa, Colo.; Dubuque, Iowa; Aberdeen, S.D.; LaCrosse, Wis.; Sheridan, Wyo.; Valentine, Neb.; Houghton Lake, Mich.;Fort Wayne, Ind.; Rockford, Ill.; Springfield, Ill.; Peoria, Ill.;Cairo, Ill.   Southern region: Fort Myers, Fla.; Alexandria, La.; Clayton,N.M.; Roswell, N.M.   Western region: Flagstaff, Ariz.; Bakersfield, Calif.; Bishop,Calif.; Santa Maria, Calif.; Stockton, Calif.; Lewiston, Idaho;Havre, Mont.; Walla Walla, Wash.; Milford, Utah; Burna, Ore.;Klamath Falls, Ore.   Pacific region: Kahului, Hawaii.   Alaska region: Barter Island, Alaska; Homer, Alaska.   In addition, the employee association said there was thepossibility that the Juneau, Alaska, forecast office would bedowngraded and that hours would be reduced at offices in Flint andSault Ste. Marie, Mich.</TEXT></DOC>
