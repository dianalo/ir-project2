And it is not enough to have only some piecesof the puzzle in place. In 1979, for example, the White House was eagerfor SALT II ratification, but public and congressional enthusiasm waslacking and Soviet foreign policy behavior was uncooperative. Today,there is passionate public support for arms control, but the White Houseis more interested in deployments than limitations. Hence, arms controlprogress requires that all the internal political factors be broughtinto positive alignment; any agreement will have to run the gauntletof these potential impediments. Several implications follow from thisfact which are reviewed by the author.</TEXT></DOC>
