In a study led by Steven M. Schnittman of the National Instituteof Allergy and Infectious Diseases, researchers discovered that ina patient with active AIDS the virus that causes the disease caninfect up to 1 percent _ 1 of every 100 _ of a blood cell known asthe T4 lymphocyte.   Schnittman said in an interview that previous studies, whichused indirect measurements of the infection rate, had calculatedthat only 1 in every 10,000 to 100,000 of the T4 lymphocytes insuch a patient were infected.   The higher rate of infection, a factor that doctors call ``virusload,'' suggests that it will be more difficult to develop atherapy to find and eliminate each and every pocket of the humanimmunodeficiency virus (HIV) which causes AIDS.   ``The quantity of the virus (found in the study) was a lothigher than previously expected,'' Schnittman. ``There are morecells infected, a greater proportion, than we knew before.''   Schnittman said the study showed that a new research procedure,called polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, may be used to monitorthe level of AIDS infection as a patient progresses from a point ofshowing no symptoms to where the disease becomes life-threatening.   With PCR, he said, researchers could measure precisely theeffects of drugs being tested to control or kill the AIDS virus.   A research report authored by Schnittman and eight otherscientists was published today in the journal Science.   Schnittman said he and his colleagues used blood samples frompatients with active AIDS to conduct the PCR search for the virus.   Researchers first separated from the samples the T4 lymphocytes.These immunity cells are thought to be the primary target of theHIV virus.   Blood studies in the past counted the number of cells infectedwith the AIDS virus by measuring proteins triggered by an activeHIV virus. Thus, the level of infection was inferred instead ofdirectly measured.   But Schnittman said the PCR technique detects the geneticpattern of the AIDS virus while it is within a cell. In this way,he said, the researchers could find infected cells even when theAIDS virus is inactive.   The PCR survey, which was developed only about a year ago, hesaid, is an important new tool to help scientists understand thelife cycle of the highly complex AIDS virus, and perhaps find aweak point where the killer disease could be attacked with drugs.   Schnittman said the PCR study also showed that the AIDS virusdoes not readily infect another type of immunity cell, themonocyte, which also circulates in the blood. This finding is asurprise, he said, because a monocyte matures into an immune cellcalled macrophage. Studies have shown that macrophages in thebrain, liver and lymph nodes can be heavily loaded with AIDS.   ``The real Trojan horse in the body is the T4 cells and not themonocytes,'' said Schnittman. ``This shows the importance offocusing therapies on the (T4 lymphocyte) cells.''   AIDS is a contagious disease that attacks immune cells in thebody and renders them unable to resist disease. The HIV virus,which causes AIDs, is spread most often through sexual intercoursewith infected persons or through needles shared by intravenous drugusers.   As of May 31, 1989, AIDS had been diagnosed in 97,193 Americans,of whom more than half, or 56,468, have died since June 1, 1981,according to the Centers for Disease Control. No one is known tohave recovered from AIDS.   Schnittman's coauthors in the study were H. Clifford Lane,Ferdinand Massari, Cecil H. Fox and Tony Fauci, all of NIH;Miltiades C. Psallidopoulos, Louis Thompson and Normal P. Salzmanof Georgetown University School of Medicine in Washington; andMichael Baseler of Program Resources, Inc.
