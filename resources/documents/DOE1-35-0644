High efficiency operation of the boilersrequires a combustion control so that the operation is compatible withthe environmental protection, and corresponds to verifications in thecoal rank. Guidelines for combustion monitoring and optimum operationneeds to be established. As for stopping and starting of the operationlate at night, the rising rate of the turbine speed should be determinedcorrespondingly to the thermal stress, and the automation is desired.The operator support system is effective for early-forecasting and copingwith abnormalities if generated. Further, the system serves for completenessof the field-monitoring. The constitution of the system should be determinedfrom the collective view points of the contents, the manipulation, thereliability and so forth. Adoption of man-machine systems utilizing CRT,computer-aided manufacturing, and development of an expert system utilizingdesign informations, experience-informations, etc. as the data base aredesired. Though the central control is widely applied, a rapid progressin the operator support system is expected. (6 figs, 2 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
