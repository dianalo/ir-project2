Aldus's pending issue is creating more enthusiasm among investors than practically any initial public offering since Microsoft Corp., another Washington state-based software concern, came along in March 1986.    Fund managers expect Aldus stock to be offered at $19 to $20 a share, well above the $14 to $16 indicated in the preliminary prospectus prepared by underwriters Alex. Brown andamp; Sons Inc. and Montgomery Securities. Some sources say the price could go even higher.    At $16 a share, Aldus would have a market value of $165 million. The three-year-old company earned $3.5 million, or 31 cents a share, in the year ended March 31 on revenue of $18.4 million. A $16 share price would give it a price-earnings ratio of about 50 and a price-revenue multiple of about 8.    &quot;That's the richest multiple I've seen in years,&quot; an analyst at a company participating in the underwriting said. Aldus is &quot;not a cheap stock,&quot; Michael Murphy of the California Technology Stock Letter said.    Aldus's cheerleaders -- and there are many -- say the company is the runaway leader in desktop publishing. Its Pagemaker software, which allows users to design, format and print high-quality documents, has more than 60,000 users and the widest brand recognition in a fledgling market since Lotus Development Corp.'s 1-2-3 spreadsheet program.    By being the early leader in the desktop market, Aldus has already built a sizable barrier against competitors, industry specialists say.    &quot;If you're first, you can afford to be good enough,&quot; software developer Daniel Bricklin said. &quot;The ones that come after you have to be a lot better.&quot; Mr. Bricklin designed the Visicalc spreadsheet and dominated that market before Lotus 1-2-3 appeared.    But Aldus's real strength is still among users of the Apple Macintosh, analysts say. Even though it can operate on International Business Machines Corp.'s PC AT and compatible microcomputers, it faces some major competitors, including Xerox Corp.'s Ventura.    Leading software companies such as Microsoft and Lotus have begun to integrate desktop publishing features into their word-processing products, and WordPerfect Corp., a leading maker of word-processing software for IBM PCs, plans to include a number of desktop publishing features in its next product release.    The desktop publishing market is larger and more complex than the niche that Aldus dominates, David Boucher said. Mr. Boucher, president of Interleaf Inc., a Cambridge, Mass.-based maker of desktop publishing software for office use, said Pagemaker will appeal to users who need extensively designed short documents. For those with more comprehensive needs, there are other products, including Interleaf's own Technical Publishing System.    Finally, industry executives such as Mr. Boucher note the continuing rapid changes in the desktop publishing business. With computer prices falling and laser printers changing in both price and performance, &quot;Aldus will have to work hard to stay in step with the business,&quot; one analyst said.    But even if it doesn't develop another product, Aldus could dominate the low-end desktop publishing market for years, Alex Henderson, a technology analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said.    Mr. Bricklin, the software developer, said the $20 million or so that Aldus expects to raise in the offering will make it an even more formidable competitor than it is now. That kind of money, he said, should allow the Aldus management to make acquisitions and &quot;round themselves out&quot; in much the same manner as Lotus and others have done.    ---   Eric J.
