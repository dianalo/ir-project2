The SERIFast Pyrolysis Process, originally designed for wood pyrolysis, has beenadapted for pyrolysis of RDF. Differences in the nature of the feedstockand resulting product tars and oils are described. RDF tar viscosityas a function of temperature is compared to wood oil. Techniques usedto solve difficult aerosol collection problems are discussed. Preliminaryyield results are given.</TEXT></DOC>
