Yesterday, Mr. Rostenkowski came out forfull disclosure.   A firestorm of public outrage has finally convinced aresisting House Speaker Tom Foley to support releasing thenames of all the check-kiters after a 20-day period, duringwhich they can challenge the bank's records. Mr.Rostenkowski, who faces the most difficult election of hiscareer in next Tuesday's primary in Chicago, has changed histune completely.</LP><TEXT>   His opponent, former Alderman Dick Simpson, had pummeledhim for his refusal to discuss his bank records. Soyesterday, Mr. Rostenkowski released a September letter fromthe House Bank saying that he has &quot;never placed this officein a position that would require additional funding to youraccount.&quot; He now says his party's leaders were &quot;crazy&quot; intrying to release the names of only the 24 worst offenders.   In fact, the party's leaders were only operating by HouseRules, the rules that in our time seem to exempt Congressfrom all the disciplines of normal life. They pass laws butexempt their own institution from coverage by them. Theyinsulate themselves from political challenge withgerrymanders, franked mail and financial tribute fromobeisant lobbies. We have known since the Magna Carta thatthe lawmaker above the law is a formula for personal andpublic corruption. The horror of the House Bank waspreordained.   We assume that Mr. Rostenkowski does indeed have a cleanrecord at the House Bank, and his sudden support for fulldisclosure moved the affair in the proper direction. Withoutdisclosure, rumors would have dogged every Member through theelection. We suspect, though, that the issue is far from deadin Illinois.   Mr. Simpson, for instance, says the only time Mr.Rostenkowski &quot;stands up to special interests is on the golfcourse,&quot; where he frequently tees off with lobbyists. MelReynolds, a former Rhodes Scholar, is challenging Rep. GusSavage, a Chicago Democrat, famous mainly for his tiradesagainst whites and Jews and for his lively junkets aroundAfrica. Mr. Reynolds is attacking Rep. Savage for refusing todiscuss his House Bank records. Rep. Phil Crane, aconservative Republican, has a fine intellectual record but alackluster legislative one. He's under attack forcongressional junkets and use of the franking privilege.   Politicians are adept at neutralizing bad news, but thelatest Washington Post poll has only 22% of the publicapproving of Congress. The House Bank mess would somehow havebeen swept under what must be the world's biggest rug, but itlooks as if the Members have run out of places to hide. HouseMajority Whip Richard Gephardt began the week pressuring hisparty's caucus to support the Ethics Committee's absurdlynarrow definition of a bank abuser. But too many Democratslike Mr. Rostenkowski balked. &quot;A lot of Members don't want tocommit political suicide,&quot; says Dawanna Merritt, an aide toRep. Benjamin Cardin.   Another reason why many Members finally backed fulldisclosure was that they are coming to doubt the accuracy ofthe letters written last year by House Sergeant-at-Arms JackRuss, which many Members have waved as proof that they didn'tkite any checks. &quot;I wouldn't vouch for the completeness ofMr. Russ's files last year,&quot; says Rep. Nancy Johnson, anEthics Committee Member, who has seen the GAO's recent bankaudit.   John Jackley, a former staffer to several DemocraticMembers, says that at least one Member bounced many morechecks than the records kept by the Sergeant-at-Arms showed.Mr. Jackley, the author of a forthcoming expose of Congresscalled &quot;Hill Rat,&quot; says the bank scandal shouldn't be closeduntil it's known if any of the check-kiters violated tax orFederal Election Commission laws.   Of course, if this were the Executive Branch, a SpecialProsecutor would have been appointed months ago. Congress hasexempted itself from the Ethics in Government Law. But it nowlooks as if most of the House Bank story will come out. Aswith the Wright scandal and the Keating Five, though, apublic outcry had to force the leadership's hand. This time,many Members are furious at the damage of their leaders'mishandling. Look for House Members to consider their ownhousecleaning of Congress's leadership next January. Thefaces of some of the cleaners, however, may be new.</TEXT></DOC>
