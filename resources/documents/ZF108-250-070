MILLARD rode the computer boom of the early1980s to the top.andP;  In 1984 Forbes dubbed the CEO and owner of Computer-Landthe &quot;Instant Billionaire&quot; and ranked him as the 27th richest man in America.andO;To Millard, a disciple of Werner Erhard's human-potential movement, est, thepossibilities for the future seemed limitless.andM;But in his rise to power, Millard had left a trial of greed paved with brokenpromises and betrayal.andP;  The price of power had not been cheap.andM;Today, Millard is a virtual recluse, surrounded by 30-foot-high walls on aremote Pacific island, his life threatened and his computer chain wrestedfrom his once-iron grip.andP;  How did he come to such an unlikely end?andM;In this first part of a two-part excerpt adapted from his expanded edition ofOnce Upon a Time In Computerland (Simon andamp; Schuster, 1990), Jonathan Littmanreveals how Millard's tragically flawed New Age reverie brought hmiface-to-face with a shadow world of corruption--and even murder.andM;MILLARD'S AMAZING ASCENT began in 1976, when former miniature-racetrackfranchiser John Martin pitched him an idea for a chain of computer stores,eventually to become the ComputerLand empire.andM;Millard was wary of outsiders.andP;  He had lost his first company, SystemDynamics, to venture capitalists, and he vowed to friends and associates thathe would never let it happen again.andM;Just months before Martin pitched him the franchise idea, Millard's secondcompany, IMS, a computer manufacturer, had needed capital.andP;  The entrepreneurhad chosen financial partners carefully.andP;  The lender he chose, Marriner andamp;Company, was headed by Loring Reed, the father of his friend and partnerPhilip Reed.andP;  Millard had five years to buy back the $250,000 promissory notebefore Marriner could convert it into 20 percent of Millard's holdings.andM;To budding empire-builder Millard, control was essential.andP;  So when he hiredMartin, he was careful to offer him little more than weekly payments and apromise of stock if the idea flew.andM;Despite his rocky past, Millard had a gift for attracting investors anddedicated employees.andP;  Est was his competitive edge.andP;  A friend and disciple ofest founder Werner Erhard, Millard hired Erhard devotees and gave companysermons, chanting the est-ian catchwords sharing, space, acknowledgment, andagreement.andP;  Millard enlisted children and families in his crusade, promisingcompany stock while doing business on charisma and a handshake.andM;Like all Millard employees, Martin took the rigorous est training, and heworked marathon hours for the company.andP;  Amazingly, in a few whirlwind months,he had signed up 17 ComputerLand franchisees, with options for dozens more.andO;But the nonstop pace was too much for Martin.andP;  He wanted out and he wantedhis promised stock.andP;  When Millard offered a meager 1 percent, Martin sworerevenge.andM;The following year, Millard's computer manufacturing company, now calledIMSAI, went bankrupt--his second failure--but not before much of its moneyand resources had flowed next door to his third enterprise, ComputerLand.andO;Philip Reed, who had propped up Millard's early ventures with hundreds ofthousands of dollars out of his own pocket, was left near bankruptcy andwithout any ComputerLand stock to show for years of effort.andP;  When Millardrefused to lend him money, Reed joined forces with Martin.andM;Over the years, the sudden departure of trusted employees became a familiarpattern.andP;  Sooner or later, associates realized that Millard took his estprinciples seriously: he alone would dictate the meaning of his businessagreements.andP;  So it was that Millard declared that Marriner's promissory notewould not be converted into ComputerLand stock--that he would simply repaythe $250,000 dollars when the note came due, in 1981.andM;When the critical deadline for repayment arrived, Millard received a noticefrom a company called Micro/Vest.andP;  The mystery company claimed that it ownedthe note, and it wanted its stock.andP;  Millard chose to ignore the request, andMicro/Vest filed suit.andM;The same year, 1981, IBM introduced its PC, and ComputerLand's sales begantheir dizzying climb.andP;  It was also the year Millard discovered that his newadversaries were his old partners: John Martin and Philip Reed were behindMicro/Vest, along with Bruno Andrighetto, who was one of the originalinvestors in the $250,000 note.andM;Millard hired the best legal guns money could buy to fight the suit.andP;  In themeantime, he began to amass an elaborate corporate-funded personal empire,complete with a fleet of planes, a vineyard, a resort, and a five-level,security-controlled luxury home.andM;Convinced that his miraculous financial success was a harbinger of globalpower, Millard wrote of his desire to lead the world in business andpolitics.andP;  He jetted to the four corners of the earth, sometimes bringingErhard along as an adviser, conferring with Buddhists and Zen masters, andspreading his New Age message to heads so state.andP;  On one trip, Millard dinedwith a top Chinese minister at Beijing's Summer Palace of the Emperors; onanother, he chatted with Margaret Thatcher.andM;But while Millard dreamed of a global empire beyond computers, Martin andReed hustled shares in Micro/Vest, selling them on the basis of the 20percent stock option in ComputerLand.andP;  They made millions of dollars frominvestors and in the process created the first syndicated lawsuit in America.andM;Flanked by an ex-Secret Service man for President Ford and a former FBIagent, Millard sat before an Alameda County, California, jury for tengrueling weeks of 1985.andP;  Herbert Hafif, the celebrated personal injury lawyerwho represented Micro/Vest, vilified Millard as a greedy billionaire welsher,and the jury followed suit.andP;  Millard was ordered to hand over 20 percent ofComputerLand plus a record-setting $141 million in punitive damages.andO;Newspapers estimated that Micro/Vest and its investors had won $500 million.andM;Millard's response?andP;  A face-lift and isolation.andP;  Flouting the court judgment,Millard schemed to take his $1.4-billion empire bankrupt, and for a time itseemed he was ready to destroy everything.andP;  Then, at the last minute, Hafifaverted disaster for Micro/Vest by trading the uncollectable punitive damagesfor another 8 percent of ComputerLand.andP;  Although Millard accepted thesettlement, his lawyers began planned an appeal.andM;Nearly ruined by the published threats of bankruptcy, ComputerLandfranchisees demanded the removal of the increasingly alienated Millard, a CEOwho by now ran his corporation from his attic.andM;He retreated into self-imposed exile on the Pacific island tax haven ofSaipan (part of the U.S.andP;  Marianas), only to find himself the target of the&quot;Millard tax bill,&quot; Saipan's plot to rake in his millions.andP;  In turn, Millardcharged government officials with attempted bribery.andP;  Then came death threatsagainst Millard, FBI investigations, and government and grand jury hearings.andM;But that was only half of the story.andP;  On another Pacific island, Millard'sarchenemy, John Martin, was plotting his greatest takeover yet.andM;Millard's day of reckoning had only just begun.andM;The Story Resumes .andP;  .  .andM;In 1987, four years after Millard's ouster, a buyer for the beleagueredComputerLand chain finally was found.andP;  Micro/Vest investors blanched whenthey saw the valuation for the sale.andP;  The financiers of the deal, Warburg,Pincus andamp; Company of New York, put the price for 100 percent of Computerlandat a little over $150 million: Millard wanted to sell 53 percent, and thefinanciers, were prepared to buy Micro/Vest's shares at the same price ratio.andM;Micro/Vest investors couldn't help but think back to Martin's promises andHafif's portrayal of Millard as a billionaire.andP;  They added up the figures.andO;If Micro/Vest withstood Millard's court appeal, its share of the companywould be 28 percent.andP;  Twenty-eight percent of $150 million was just $42million, making 1 percent of Micro/Vest worth only $420,000.andP;  But Martin hadsold shares for almost double that amount: one group of lawyers had paidnearly $750,000 for just 1 percent of Micro/Vest.andM;Could it be true, wondered some of the Micro/Vest investors?andP;  Newspapers hadestimated ComputerLand's value at more than $500 million.andP;  Where had alltheir money gone, and how could it have been reduced to a paltry $42 million?andO;Six long years of fighting, and now, after a stunning court victory, theinvestment was revealed to be not a bonanza but a bomb.andM;When they saw how little money would be available, some investors tried tokill the sale.andP;  &quot;Personal greed and emotions had become a bigger issue thanthe survival of the company,&quot; recalls Ken Waters, president of ComputerLand.andO;&quot;They were willing to fight forever and not take money on the table.&quot;andP;  Fed upwith his clients, Hafif abandoned his attempts to sell Micro/Vest's share ofComputerLand.andM;But the sale had a momentum of its own.andP;  The final documents were signedduring the summer of 1987 at a site of Millard's choosing, the Regency Hotelin Hong Kong.andP;  Clauses prohibiting Millard from ever sitting on the boardwould be written into the tremendously complex contract.andP;  Warburg would notfinance the 28 percent involved in Micro/Vest's suit (or the 16 percent tiedup in yet another employee stock suit).andP;  If Millard should somehow win hisappeals of both cases, he would still own 44 percent of ComputerLand.andP;  It wasa scenario that would give few franchisees comfort.andM;Meanwhile, in Saipan, Millard was preparing to testify before a committeeinvestigating his allegations of government corruption.andP;  The island ofSaipan, boasting the world's most temperate climate and the world's highestper-capita consumption of Budweiser, seemed an unlikely spot for anythingquite so serious.andP;  Says Saipan assistant U.S.andP;  attorney George Proctor, whohas never doubted the island's reputation as the king of Bud,  &quot;There is ahell of a lot of beer-drinking on the beach.&quot;andM;The living was easy on Saipan.andP;  But one beautiful summer day, a new wind blewinto paradise.andM;High on Saipan's Capitol Hill, graced by palm trees and lush lawns, stood theHouse Session Hall.andP;  At the end of the shoe box-shaped room, lined up behinda long table, sat the legislators of Saipan.andP;  Many of the men looked alike,not altogether surprising on an island where nearly everyone is related andtax rolls are indexed by first names.andM;The House Session Hall was jammed with legislators, government workers,native Saipanese, and every journalist on the island--all four of them.andP;  Manyof the Saipanese stood by the door, chatting in their native Chamorro,straining to get a look at the action.andM;The former Instant Billionaire sat at a table just a few feet before hisinquisitors, dressed in a tropical short-sleeved shirt, white trousers, andwhite shoes.andP;  One of the first witnesses was a short, middle-aged man namedGalen Mack, who had worked as a consultant for Millard.andP;  The government'sattorney questioned Mack about the bribes that government officials hadallegedly requested from Millard in exchange for protection from tax laws.andO;Mack hesitated, then named five men.andP;  Later he would regret his candor anddeliver a written retraction to the local newspaper.andM;The legislators demanded to know why Millard had spilled the beans to the FBIand not to the local authorities.andP;  Millard's attorney, Terry Giles, lost histemper.andP;  &quot;Because,&quot; he shouted, &quot;we don't trust you and we don't trust yourcommittee!andP;  Now that's saying it just about as plain as I can say it.&quot;andM;But the legislators had another view of &quot;the way it is in Saipan.&quot;andP;  WhenMillard finally testified, they were curious as to why a Californiabillionaire would move his corporate headquarters to a tiny, obscure islandin the Pacific.andM;&quot;That is personal!&quot; objected Giles, pounding the table and leaping to hisfeet.andP;  Millard, however, appeared unaffected by the obvious reference to themillions in U.S.andP;  taxes he had dodged by moving to the island.andP;  When Millardspoke, the hall grew silent.andP;  A lot of people thought the truth was finallygoing to come out.andM;Millard told of being solicited for bribes in exchange for protection fromSaipan's tax law.andP;  &quot;I said no, never, no way, not a dime.&quot;andP;  But after all thelegal motions to delay his testimony, after all of Gile's angry accusations,it seemed, at least as best as Millard could recall, that the accentriccomputer tycoon, &quot;had never been approached directly by any public officialfor a bribe.&quot;andM;The rulers of Saipan (who, like their subjects, tend to have the same lastnames) did not take the allegations lightly.andP;  Governor Pedro P. Tenorio andLieutenant Governor Pedro A. Tenorio had a name for the man who had sought toexploit their island tax haven and then had seen fit to slander its entiregovernment.andP;  In a joint public statement they declared, &quot;William Millard is aliar.&quot;andM;Three months later, a more powerful message was delivered on what seemed likejust another typical Saipan beer-drinking day.andP;  Around noon Galen Macks, thefirst witness for the government in the bribery case, picked up a young womanand began driving out of town.andM;Mack drove the woman down the crushed-coral roads to deserted Obyan Beach, apristine hideaway not far from the airport and roughly 4 miles from Millard'shome.andP;  By nightfall, Mack's wife was worried.andP;  Her husband had not shown upfor lunch, and when he failed to return for dinner, she called the police.andM;That same evening a friend of Mack's phoned David Hughes, the editor of thelocal paper, and asked if Mack had sopped by the newspaper.andP;  &quot;There wassupposed to be a letter for you,&quot; the man told the newspaper editor withoutoffering an explanation.andP;  Hughes told the man that nothing had arrived.andO;Later it would be revealed that Mack had made an appointment to meet theisland's assistant U.S.andP;  attorney to discuss possible corruption and crime inSaipan.andM;The next evening two boys walked near Obyan Beach, hunting for the small landcrabs found underneath Saipan's coconut trees.andP;  They wandered onto a paththrough the &quot;boonies,&quot; the island name for the dense jungle vegetation.andM;Face-down on the path, a few feet apart, lay the bodies of a man and a woman.andO;Bullets fired point-blank from a .45 Magnum pistol had shattered the backs oftheir skulls.andP;  Several hundred yards from the site of the execution-stylekillings, Galen Mack's abandoned four-wheel-drive truck was foundundisturbed.andM;Paranoia and Dark GeniusandM;Halfway around the world, in California, John Martin was sure he was beingwatched.andP;  One day he pulled an electronic instrument off his bumper.andP;  &quot;It's asophisticated military tracking device,&quot; he told his wife, Susan Musumeci,after placing the ominous black box on the seat between them.andP;  &quot;People bombeach other this way.&quot;andP;  Then there was the phone message he played for her:&quot;You f---ing son of a bitch....andP;  Your time is coming...&quot;andM;Every few weeks, Martin would withdraw into isolation, refusing to go out formeals or other activities.andP;  He would carry his microwaved dinner into aclosed room, smoke marijuana (Martin often smoked the drug throughout theday, storing joints over the visor of his red Italian convertible), and watchtelevision or movies on his VCR.andM;He preferred old movies, especially those starring Humphrey Bogart, and hisfavorite was The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, the classic tale of greed, inwhich the paranoid character played by Bogart is ready to murder his fellowprospectors to protect his share of gold.andM;During these dark periods, Martin ate chocolate incessantly and smoked 40 to60 cigarettes a day, often not waiting for one to burn out before he lit thenext.andP;  He slept little, drinking several of his 20 to 30 daily cups of coffeein the middle of the night, a time when his mind frequently turned to hishero, Howard Hughes.andP;  But Martin told his wife not to worry: &quot;He always saidhe would not be as insane as Howard Hughes,&quot; Musumeci recalls.andM;Martin's days and nights were consumed by his fear and hatred of Millard.andO;&quot;He considered Millard evil,&quot; says Musumeci.andP;  &quot;He was going to rid the worldof evil.&quot;andM;She would awake in the early morning hours to see her husband sitting in bed,smoking, drinking coffee, wringing-wet in his own sweat.andP;  &quot;I'm tryng to letgo of it,&quot; Martin would say, shivering.andP;  &quot;He's trying to knock me off.&quot;andM;Musumeci had tried to separate from Martin, but he always came back, wantinganother chance.andP;  When she moved to Maui, Martin moved to Maui, installingfive phone lines, a fax machine, and his girlfriend in a house down thestreet.andM;His feverish plotting didn't mellow under the Hawaiian sun.andP;  For nearly ayear Martin had been making flights back to southern California on a secretmission.andP;  &quot;I've got a major game plan,&quot; he told his wife.andP;  &quot;Something thatwill blow everybody out of the water.andP;  We'll be able to go anywhere.&quot;andM;And blow he did.andP;  John Martin was on the evening news.andP;  A whole minute and ahalf.andP;  Hundreds of thousands of people watched in the San Francisco Bay Area.andO;Martin had filed the largest bankruptcy in the history of Hawaii.andP;  Thenumbers were fantastically high, propelling him into the lofty realm ofHoward Hughes.andP;  For Martin was now a billionaire--in debt.andM;&quot;John Martin, a co-founder and frequent adversary of Computer-Land Corp., hasfiled a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition in which he claims an astounding $1.6billion in liabilities,&quot; read the San Francisco Chronicle.andM;Few saw the dark genius of Martin's move.andP;  By filing for bankruptcy, Martindelayed paying the hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars he owedto his wife, lawyer Herbert Hafif, law firms, and the accounting firm ofArthur Young.andP;  (He neglected to inform the court that many of the suits helisted as liabilities, including the $1.2-billion Marriner andamp; Company suit,had been settled or dismissed.)andM;Martin's real strategy went much further than the notoriety of being over$1.5 billion in debt.andP;  Buried in the bulky bankruptcy petition were two pagestitled &quot;Executory Contracts.&quot;andP;  Listed on those pages was the nearly $2million Herbert Hafif and others had paid Martin for Micro/Vest stock and the5 percent apiece that Hafif and fellow litigator Harold Nachtrieb had earnedfor trying and winning the case against Millard.andM;Martin wanted all the Micro/Vest stock back--and more.andP;  Never mind that hehad pocketed the investors' payments for Micro/Vest shares.andP;  He claimed tohave sold executory contracts to shareholders, and if he deemed the contractsunperformed, he could collect the stock--and keep the money he had pocketed.andO;Martin had demanded that the investors pay him for the legal expensesMicro/Vest had incurred, and with good reason they had refused.andP;  It was wellknown that he hadn't been paying his fees either.andP;  &quot;Martin was also behind inlegal fees,&quot; says his friend and fellow Micro/Vest investor BrunoAndrighetto.andP;  &quot;We should have taken the stock away from him, too!&quot;andM;Defying reason, Martin claimed to have increased his shares by selling piecesof the note.andP;  Though Micro/Vest insiders put Martin's stake at between 3 and8 percent, Martin declared that he owned 30 percent of the note, plus a 10percent bonus for the legal fees he had paid.andP;  Martin may not have finishedhigh school, but he counted his way up to owning more than 40 percent of thestock of Micro/Vest--far more than when he first sliced the pie into thirdswith Reed and Andrighetto.andM;Only weeks remained before the oral argument in the appeal that once and forall would decide Micro/Vest's 28 percent ownership of ComputerLand's stock.andO;&quot;I saw through his plan,&quot; Micro/Vest president John Molinari claims.andP;  &quot;Martinsays, 'I own!&quot; says Molinari, who saw a similar rationale in the man theywere all supposedly fighting--Bill Millard.andM;Sound and FuryandM;On October 20, 1988, the state appellate court in San Francisco hummed withthe sound of spectators and the press.andP;  Martin's barrel-chested attorney,Herbert Hafif, stood just outside the doors, pacing in his ill-fitting suitand heavy brown shoes.andP;  Some saw his rough face through the glass doors, hisdark eyes heavy with thick bags that appeared more like the scars of oldfights than the result of long years before the jury.andP;  Behind the toughvisage was a hint of nerves.andP;  The war against Millard had consumed eight longyears and millions of dollars in legal bills, all to enforce one simplecontract.andP;  One hour would decide the issue.andM;Millard's appeal gave plenty of cause for concern.andP;  In a lengthy brief, hisattorney, Shirley Hufstedler, wrote that Millard's holding company had beendissolved years before in an elaborate Panamanian tax-skirting scheme (on theadvice of Werner Erhard's twice-indicted tax attorneys).andP;  And with that magicdissolution, the attorney made Millard's obligations disappear--including the20 percent Marriner promissory note.andP;  The only problem with this cleverargument was that the dissolution never actually occurred.andM;Hafif strode to the defendant's table on the left of the courtroom, headdown, locked in concentration.andP;  On his right, curiously apart from theMicro/Vest group, sat John Martin, tanned and heavier, flanked by hisgirlfriend, his lawyers, and his entourage.andP;  Hafif glanced over and thoughtback to their first meeting, and once again asked himself why he had taken acase on behalf of a man he despised.andM;Even Martin's allies had begun to wonder about their fiery leader.andP;  Not onlyhad Martin filed a complaint against Micro/Vest demanding that it turn over40 percent of the shares that Martin claimed had already vested, butindividual investors unwilling to pay him tens of thousands of dollars werewarned that their stock, too, might join Hafif's and the others marked forcollection.andM;And why not?andP;  Martin knew he was the creator!andP;  He had envisioned the grandconcept, the map of the computer marketplace, and sold the first franchises!andO;In the beginning the ComputerLand note was his and his alone.andP;  It was Martinwho stalked the victim, preyed on its weakness, and now anyone who dared tostep in his path would risk his vengeance.andM;Hafif listened as Shirley Hufstedler began to unravel Millard's bizarreargument to the court.andP;  Hufstedler quickly advanced the notion of the&quot;impropriety&quot; of the $141 million in punitive damages.andM;One of the three justices interrupted.andP;  Had not Micro/Vest waived themonetary damages in exchange for an additional 8 percent of stock, he askedHafif?andM;The lawyer bowed his head in agreement.andP;  Tales of dead companies andextinguished options brought the hint of a smile to the well-preparedjustice.andP;  Hufstedler's frustration increased.andP;  Ruffled, she began makingdeclarations of fact.andP;  &quot;Marriner never lent ComputerLand a cent!&quot; sheprotested.andM;Hafif could smell victory, but he knew its taste would not be satisfying.andP;  Hehad spent a lifetime fighting the rich and the powerful.andP;  He knew why he hadtaken the case: &quot;To show that no matter how much money you have, no matterhow powerful your lawyers are, and no matter how much money you paid them, ondown to the final appeal--you can be stopped.&quot;andM;But where was the satisfaction when Micro/Vest's partners mimicked the enemythat Hafif set out to destroy, when they turned on one another like pirates,when he had warmer feelings for Bill Millard than for his own client, andwhen he knew that Millard, for all his bullheadedness, for all his distorted,misguided principles, was not half as dangerous as a man like John Martin?andM;Hafif attacked Hufstedler's argument, thrusting his big arms, punching outfighting words.andP;  Avoiding the legal points, he concentrated on--of allthings--ethics, warning that lawyers, tarnished with a reputation equal tothat of used-car dealers, were on the verge of sinking to the level ofinsurance companies.andM;The justices cautioned him to temper his outrage and he struggled to stop hisoutbursts.andP;  But before his attack was over and done, Hafif had shouted outwhat he truly thought of Hufstedler's argument and Millard's eight-year,multimillion-dollar legal battle.andM;&quot;It's all insanely about nothing, all of it!&quot;andM;End of Part IandM;Jonathan Littman is a journalist covering Silicon Valley and thehigh-technology industry.andP;
