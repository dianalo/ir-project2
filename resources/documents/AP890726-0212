They ``demonstrate how dramatic results can be obtained when astrong emphasis is placed on rooting out corruption,'' he said.   Federal prosecutors got convictions against 529 federalofficials, 69 state officials, 229 local officials and 240 privatecitizens tied to public corruption, Thornburgh said in a report toCongress.   The U.S. attorney's office in Chicago had 119 convictions in1988, followed by 89 in the Eastern District of New York, coveringthe Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island boroughs of New York Cityand the suburban counties on Long Island, 49 in Massachusetts and48 in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.   The Chicago prosecutors put away aldermen, judges, attorneys andcourt officers who took and paid bribes for favors. Oneinvestigation, dubbed Operation Deadfall, snagged corrupt policeofficers who accepted money to steer bodies to certain funeralhomes.   ``There are those who believe that taking bribes is agratuity,'' said Anton Valukas, the government's top prosecutor inChicago. ``That attitude is amazing. Those who are there aresupposed to be assisting citizens, not looting.''   Since 1978, the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern Districtof New York, covering the New York City boroughs of Manhattan andThe Bronx and suburban counties north of the city, has the mostconvictions involving public officials, 477. Chicago is second at412.</TEXT></DOC>
