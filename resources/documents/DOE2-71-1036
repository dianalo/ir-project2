One plant is a novel wind pump system with hydraulic energy transmissionand best-point-of-operation control for drinking-water supply; the otherone is a DARRIEUS wind turbine with an electric generator for supplyinga village with power. The authors use system and result diagrams, andphotographs to demonstrate the wind energy converter with deep-well pumpand electric generator (auto-excited synchronous generator) fitted witha three-blade rotor and located on a 70 m high hill. The authors presentoperational results (wind conditions, weak-wind properties of the plant,d.c. starter motor, supply to network) and technical and economic aspects(price per kWh in dependence from wind speed).
