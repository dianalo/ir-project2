The Richmond, Va.-based transportation and energy concern was the first company to report earnings reflecting a new accounting rule concerning income taxes.    Adopting the new rule boosted net income $12 million, or seven cents a share, and full-year results $47 million, or 30 cents a share. However, the new rule and provisions of the 1986 Tax Reform Act resulted in a $294 million charge against full-year earnings.    Net totaled $129 million, or 82 cents a share, compared with a restated year-earlier $132 million, or 86 cents a share. Revenue rose 6.5% to $2.13 billion from $2 billion.    For the year, net fell 67% as the $294 million charge wiped out a 3% rise in operating earnings. Net totaled $138 million, or 88 cents a share, compared with $418 million, or $2.73 a share, in 1986. Revenue rose 10% to $8.04 billion from $7.29 billion.    The accounting rule change, passed at year end by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and mandatory for 1989, requires concerns to adjust their balance sheets to reflect the reduced top tax rates of 40% in 1987 and 34% thereafter, compared with 46% previously.
