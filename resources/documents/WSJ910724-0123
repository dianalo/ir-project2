EuropeanCommunity member states must harmonize their laws with the ECinsider-trading standard by mid-1992.   Insider trading isn't illegal in Germany, and draftlegislation could make the practice a crime or at leastexpand its definition to include people who profit fromsecond-hand information, government and banking people said.   Bonn declined to give details about the draft measure, butan official said bankers and regulators are discussingforming a supervisory authority, opposition to which hascrumbled among Germany's powerful banks. Oversight isconducted by independent panels at Germany's eight stockexchanges -- an obstacle to foreign inquiries.   Though most banks require their traders to acknowledgerules on insider trading or front-running -- taking aposition in a stock before recommending it to clients --compliance is voluntary. And bank-secrecy laws bar boursesupervisors from examining traders' accounts.                                                                                                          JAPAN'S SOCIALISTS PICK LEADER                                                                                                          Makoto Tanabe was elected leader of Japan's largestopposition party, but failed to win a strong mandate to steerthe Social Democrats toward the political mainstream. He willsucceed Takako Doi, the first woman to head a major Japaneseparty. Mr. Tanabe, 69 years old, proposed reforms includingthe first conditional acceptance of Japan's armed forces,embraced by centrist reformists but fought by the left wing,reflecting a broader ideological split.                                                                                                          ALBANIA TO DISTRIBUTE FARMLAND                                                                                                          Albanian legislation to distribute farmland for privateuse was signed into law. The country, its land collectivizedunder the former communist regime, has been plagued by foodshortages. Land will be confiscated after one year if itisn't used for crops or livestock. Meanwhile, the EuropeanCommunity said it would send $600,000 of food, medicine andother emergency aid to Albania.                                                                                                          SOUTH AFRICA'S EMIGRATION TREND                                                                                                          About 250,000 of South Africa's five million whites mightemigrate over the next five years because of political andeconomic instability, a Market Research Africa study said,noting this &quot;could result in a massive loss of crucialskills.&quot; The emigration trend is growing among those aged 16to 24 and rural Afrikaners but easing among urbanEnglish-speakers. The group also found South Africa isrelatively poor: Net assets were less than $3,500 for 20% ofurban whites and under $35,000 for more than 50% of allwhites.                                                                                                          BRAZIL HALTS TALKS WITH IMF                                                                                                          Brazil suspended debt talks with the InternationalMonetary Fund, after the IMF's chief negotiator in Brazil wasquoted as saying the country needed to change itsconstitution if it wanted to win loans, causing a politicaluproar. President Fernando Collor de Mello has asked the IMFto remove the Argentine negotiator, Jose Fajgenbaum, whoyesterday denied he mentioned the constitution in a newspaperinterview. The incident could disrupt plans for dealing withBrazil's $122.2 billion foreign debt.                                                                                                          THATCHER FOUNDATION LAUNCHED                                                                                                          The Margaret Thatcher Foundation was inaugurated in Londonto promote the former British prime minister's ideals. Thefoundation, to be financed by donations, would help formercommunist countries and other regimes as they adoptdemocracy; encourage strong links among Britain, Europe andNorth America; foster greater contact between Western nationsand those in the Mideast in that region's search for peacewith security; and promote free trade.                                                                                                          SPAIN TO CUT '91 BUDGET                                                                                                          Spain will trim its 1991 budget 2.5%, or 341 billionpesetas ($3.1 billion), following a sharp rise in governmentspending in the first half when the deficit overshot thetarget for the whole year.   The gap was widened by big spending increases on health,unemployment and pensions, and slower-than-expected growth intax revenue. Tax increases aren't planned for this year buthaven't been ruled out for next year. Spain had hoped to pareits deficit to 0.9% of gross domestic product this year from2.3% last year, but could end the year at 2%.   The defense, industry and economy agencies' budgets willhave the biggest cuts, and the public works ministry will betrimmed 7.6%, or 106 billion pesetas.   Tighter 1991 and 1992 budgets are likely to be accompaniedby a restrictive monetary policy, after last week's breakdownof talks aimed at an economic pact among unions, employersand the government to reduce inflation and boost productivitythrough moderation of wages and corporate dividends. Spain'seconomy this year could grow about 3%, but consumer spending,not investment, is spurring the recovery.                                                                                                          POSTSCRIPTS . . .                                                                                                          Japan, one of the few holdouts among developed nations, isconsidering adopting daylight-saving time to help conserveenergy. More than 50 nations use the system, advancing clocksto add an hour of daylight after the workday. . . . Australiaand Malaysia patched up their differences and pledged to workto improve their economic, cultural, diplomatic and otherlinks, which had deteriorated in the past few years.</TEXT></DOC>
