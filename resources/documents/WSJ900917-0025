With finance ministers, central bankers and otherofficials of industrial nations and developing countriesscheduled to gather in Washington late this week for thejoint annual meeting of the IMF and the World Bank, topofficials of both international agencies will be stressingthis issue, along with the need for other actions to offsethigher world oil prices and the &quot;second-round&quot; economicimpact of the Middle East crisis on developing nations.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;If the concept of international community has anymeaning,&quot; says Mr. Camdessus, then the industrial countriesmust intensify their efforts to achieve higher economicgrowth rates than can be achieved without triggering anacceleration of inflation.   &quot;In the trade area,&quot; the IMF official adds, &quot;it isessential that they open their markets further and strive formore liberal trade and payments systems. Indeed, the recentslowdown in world growth, together with the situation createdby the situation in the Middle East, make it all the moreurgent that the Uruguay Round negotiations be concludedsuccessfully.&quot;   Mr. Camdessus made his comments at a meeting of a UnitedNations group in Paris last week, where he also said thecurrent world economic outlook points to a further slowing ofgrowth rates and higher inflation rates during 1990 and 1991in industrial countries and a worsening of the exportprospects for developing countries as a result of weakerdemand for their products in world markets.   The IMF, in its annual report approved by its executivedirectors who represent the 151 member nations of theinternational agency, also said &quot;stronger efforts areurgently needed to counter protectionism and to foster a moreopen trading system with transparent, predictable andnondiscriminatory rules in order to sustain&quot; an expansion ofworld trade and provide markets for exports from the indebteddeveloping countries.   ---   EXPORT GROWTH: Both the IMF and the World Bank, in theirannual reports, noted that world trade, measured either byvolume or value terms, expanded by about 7.5% last year, downfrom an unusually high 9% increase a year earlier. Butexports of developing countries as a group failed to achievesuch big gains.   The World Bank said 1989 was the first year since 1985that exports of developing countries as a group didn't expandat a higher rate than the world average, and it noted thatshipments of manufactured goods by the major Asian exporters&quot;fell sharply&quot; last year.   Market shares for exports have been shifting, the IMFsaid.   &quot;The volume of goods exported by the U.S. increased by10.5% in 1989, the best performance among the majorindustrial countries,&quot; the IMF said, adding that this raisedthe U.S. share of total world trade, excluding oil, to 13.5%from a low of 11.5% in 1987.   Japan's share of world exports in 1989, the IMF said,declined to 10% from a peak of 11.5% in 1986, while WestGermany, displaced by the U.S. as the top world exporter ofmanufactured goods, held &quot;steady&quot; with about a 12.5% share ofnonoil exports in 1989.   ---   MAJOR WORLD EXPORTERS: According to the World Bank, 23countries rank among the leading exporters; they accountedfor about 78.2% of all exports in 1989.   The World Bank ranking, in order, of the major exportersin terms of their market-shares for all types of exports lastyear, is: U.S., West Germany, Japan, France, Britain, Italy,Canada, Soviet Union, the Netherlands, Belgium-Luxembourg,South Korea, China, Sweden, Switzerland, Singapore, Spain,Australia, Mexico, Brazil, Austria, East Germany, SaudiArabia, and Denmark.   The World Bank didn't include data on exports of Taiwan orHong Kong, both of which probably would have made the list iftheir shares of world exports had been computed.   ---   CZECHOSLOVAKIAN TRADE: Legislation to reduce U.S. tariffrates for imports from Czechoslovakia was expected to glidethrough the U.S. Congress without much difficulty before thefinal 1990 Capitol Hill adjournment next month.   But the White House plan to extend similarmost-favored-nation treatment to imports from the SovietUnion apparently won't be considered by the U.S. Congressuntil next year.   In Moscow, U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher saidlast week that Soviet officials told him that it would takefour to eight weeks for the Supreme Soviet legislative bodyto complete action on a proposed law to liberalize Sovietemigration policies.   ---   AIRBUS SUBSIDIES: U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills isleading a high-ranking delegation of U.S. corporationexecutives, bankers, labor leaders and farm group officialsto Geneva early this week to size up the prospects forcompleting the Uruguay Round of world trade negotiationslater this year.   Mrs. Hills also plans to visit Brussels and Rome beforereturning to Washington at the end of the week.   During the Brussels visit, Mrs. Hills probably will alsohold talks with European Community Commissioner FransAndriessen on a proposed agreement that would limitdevelopment subsidies provided to Airbus Industrie, thewestern European commercial aircraft-building consortium, bythe governments of West Germany, Britain, France and Spain.   U.S. and EC sources say prospects are improving that suchan agreement can be reached by the end of this month.   ---   PRIVATE INVESTMENTS IN THIRD WORLD: The InternationalFinance Corp., a World Bank affiliate that started off on asmall scale way back in 1956 to help finance manufacturingplants and other private business ventures in developingnations has become a relatively &quot;big-money&quot; operation.   In the year ending last June 30, for example, the IFC madeabout $2.2 billion in such investments and it persuadedinternational commercial banks to provide about $622 millionof that amount through participations in the IFC-approvedloans and equity investments.   Now the IFC is looking for its 135-member countries toagree late this year on a $1 billion IFC capital increasethat would allow the World Bank affiliate to step up its ownborrowings in private capital markets and keep expanding itsoperations over the next five years.   ---   COUNTERTRADE: A former senior U.S. Export-Import Bankofficial who arranges private countertrade deals between U.S.companies and others abroad, is trying to persuade U.S.trade-policy officials to be more supportive of suchtransactions.   Matt Schaffer, of D.M. Schaffer Corp., based inWashington, says Japanese trading companies have long usedcountertrade arrangements that customarily involve payment ingoods, rather than money, for exports.   Generally, countertrade opponents argue that tradingexports for other goods, ranging from bathtubs to cannedhams, is a burdensome and inefficient way of engaging ininternational trade.   Countertrade used to be a big thing in eastern Europeancountries, almost as a matter of necessity, but economicreforms now under way in that part of the world are steeringaway from countertrade transactions and U.S. trade-policyofficials have applauded this trend.</TEXT></DOC>
