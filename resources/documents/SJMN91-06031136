Give them a challenge.The courses are too consistent week to week. Too manicured, no bad lies.Toughening them up will bring the better players to the top.&quot;  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  NICKLAUS, PALMER WANT TOUGHER COURSES  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Golf Notebook  </MEMO><TEXT>     Nicklaus nodded his approval during a news conference featuring bothstars.;    &quot;I agree 100 percent,&quot; he said. &quot;Golf shouldn't be a game where youhit the same shots on the course you could on the practice tee. You must havediscipline, course management; you'll have bad lies, you must take gambles.;   &quot;It seems on tour now every week they are making it so fair nobody ever getsa bad lie or a bad break or a bad anything. As a result, nobody can separatethemselves. These guys have a lot more in them than what they're showing.&quot;;   Palmer reflected on his start in the 1950s.;    &quot;These guys should havestarted when I started,&quot; he said. &quot;The ball looked like a snowball rollingdown the fairway, picking up mud and dirt. You played it as it was.&quot;;    Oneconsequence of the regulated conditions, Palmer and Nicklaus said, is thatAmerican players are unable to handle more difficult conditions when they doencounter them, and this has showed in their trouble defeating foreign playersin international competitions.;  NO HELP, PLEASE: Palmer, 61, was asked whathe could tell Nicklaus, 51, about the difference in playing at Palmer's agecompared to Nicklaus' age.;    &quot;I don't want to know yet,&quot; said Nicklaus.;   &quot;Yeah, Jack's got a big surprise coming, a BIG surprise,&quot; quipped Palmer.; CLOUDY SKIES: The National Weather Service forecasts cloudy weather today atPebble Beach, with a 20-30 percent chance of showers Friday, and a 20 percentor less chance Saturday.;  ETC.: Curtis Strange is paired with his twinbrother, Allan, and spectators are having trouble telling them apart.
