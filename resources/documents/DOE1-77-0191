Radiation therapy usually results innecrosis and edema around the primary tumor site. Contrast-enhanced computerizedtomography (CT) and standard radionuclide imaging techniques are unableto reliably distinguish recurrent tumor from necrosis or edema sincethese images depict localization of contrast material or tracer, whichprimarily depends on blood-brain barrier breakdown. Thallium-201 (201Tl)appears to incorporate into viable tumor cells more rapidly than intonormal brain cells. This report describes a new method to quantify theuptake of 201T1 in the tumor: the tumor-to-cardiac uptake ratio (T/C).Twenty-three 201T1 brain scans were performed on eight patients to differentiaterecurrent viable high-grade astrocytoma from posttherapy changes. Planarimages of the head and heart were obtained in order to calculate theratio of tumor counts to cardiac counts. This ratio represents a numericalestimation of 201T1 uptake in the brain tumor relative to cardiac countsand is expressed as the T/C index. The T/C index correlated well withthe clinical course in all eight patients. In general, however, CT suggestedmore extensive regrowth of tumor than the actual clinical status suggested.In one patient's course of radiological monitoring, tumor recurrencewas detected by means of 201T1 imaging four months prior to its appearanceon CT. In conclusion, when performed serially, the T/C index can providean accurate estimate of residual tumor burden or recurrence, and detectand quantify viable tumor during therapy.</TEXT></DOC>
