The reorganization will mainly affect the company'sdownstream, or refining and marketing, business, the companysaid, and will result in the elimination of about 800 jobs,or about 11% of the full-time staff, by the end of 1991. Thecuts also will result in a second-quarter net charge againstearnings of about C$25 million, or about 22 Canadian cents ashare. In the 1989 second quarter, Shell Canada earned C$60million, or 54 Canadian cents a share, on revenue of C$1.21billion.</LP><TEXT>   Shell Canada, the third-largest petroleum refiner andmarketer in Canada with 16% of the national market, said it&quot;will also undertake a staged divestment of underperformingassets,&quot; including company-owned service stations anddistribution facilities. It didn't say how much it expects toraise from the asset sales.   About one-third of Shell Canada's 3,500 service stationsare company-owned, a spokesman said, and the company intendsto sell an unspecified number of these to independentoperators, who run the bulk of the stations. Somedistribution facilities and other plants also will be sold,he said, though the company's four oil refineries will beretained.   The corporate makeover includes realigning the downstreambusiness, which is organized on a regional basis, into fourseparate businesses, all based in Calgary. These will includeretail operations, commercial and industrial sales, privatebrands, and manufacturing and trading. Shell Canada's styreneand polypropylene plants, which make up its chemicals arm,will remain intact as a fifth division.   Shell Canada, which is 78.2%-owned by Royal Dutch/ShellGroup, an Anglo-Dutch concern, said the moves &quot;willcontribute to achieving significant, sustained improvement inearnings and return on investment.&quot; It didn't offer specificestimates, but the company previously said it aims ultimatelyto double last year's dismal 4.4% rate of return oninvestment in its downstream arm.   Such an improvement would effectively boost downstreamprofit to about C$150 million annually, using current assetfigures, up from C$79 million last year.   &quot;You can't continue in a business in the modern world,especially in Canada, with its {high} interest rates beingwhat they are, with a 4% return on investment,&quot; the spokesmansaid. &quot;That's what is driving this {restructuring}.&quot;   Investors and analysts didn't show much enthusiasm for therestructuring announcement, which followed earlier statementsby the company that it was considering such a move. InToronto Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Shell Canada sharesclosed at C$38.125, down 12.5 Canadian cents, and justslightly above its 52-week low of C$37.50.   &quot;In many respects, the company is walking away from itsdownstream problems, instead of fixing them,&quot; said DavidStenason, an analyst with Levesque, Beaubien Geffrion Inc. Hesaid the company has trailed its competitors in upgradingrefineries and improving underground storage tanks at retailstations, and faces about C$3.5 billion of capital outlaysthrough 1994, largely in its upstream, or oil and gasexploration and production, operations.   Mr. Stenason estimated that Shell Canada will generatecash flow -- earnings plus depreciation allowances -- ofabout C$550 million this year, or about C$200 million lessthan its capital spending requirements, forcing it to take onadditional debt. He sees debt rising to about 30% ofcapitalization within 18 months, up from 20% now.</TEXT></DOC>
