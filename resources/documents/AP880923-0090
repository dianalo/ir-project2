The troops continued to hunt henchmen of the deposed Duvalierdynasty Thursday but slowed down their campaign to remove hatedcommanders, independent radio reports said.   The military government headed by Lt. Gen. Prosper Avrilappealed for an end to a surge of lawlessness since Saturday'scoup, but even a government spokesman acknowledged Avril's tenuoushold on the government.   ``Formal instructions have been passed on to the forces of orderto arrest all individuals commiting acts of brigandage andpillaging,'' said a military statement read on state televisionlate Thursday. It said violators would be ``duly tried andpunished.''   Sporadic gunfire continued through the night and there werecontinued reports of reprisal attacks. But for the most part thecapital was calm Thursday.   Avril, a former army adjutant, assumed the presidency afternon-commissioned officers and other lower ranking enlisted men roseup against Gen. Henri Namphy and sent him into exile in theneighboring Dominican Republic.   Since then, rank-and-file soldiers throughout the country haverevolted against their commanders, despositing a few of themhandcuffed outside the army headquarters in Port-au-Prince, thecapital.   Radio Haiti Inter reported the ouster Thursday of two morecommanders, in the southwestern town of Cotes de Fer and thenorthern port of St. Marc, bringing to 21 the number of commanderswho served under Namphy known to have been forcibly removed.   It was unclear whether the 21 commanders were included in the 29officers referred to in the army's later communique.   The commander of the 40-man St. Marc barracks, Capt. ErnstRavix, a suspected Macoute sympathizer, was ousted by troops a dayafter soldiers in the city fired on a crowd of demonstrators,killing a 12-year-old boy and wounding three other people. TheCotes de Fer commanders were not identified.   The radio said that after Radix was arrested and brought toPort-au-Prince, soldiers launched a hunt for the Tonton Macoutes,who have long terrorized the local population.   The Tonton Macoutes were the private henchmen of PresidentJean-Claude Duvalier, who was forced into exile in February 1986.   Bernard Degraff, the government's assistant director ofinformation, said the removal of unpopular officers now wasproceeding peacefully, indicating the soldiers had the tacitsupport of the government.   ``The ouster movement should cease very soon,'' he said,acknowledging that ``loss of control of the situation is stillpossible.''   Namphy's country retreat in Foret des Pins outsidePort-au-Prince was among the homes reported pillaged.   The Roman Catholic Church's Radio Soliel broadcast an interviewwith an unidentified corporal who appealed to soldiers to stopfiring their weapons into the air because it was hampering thesearch for Tonton Macoutes, who sometimes fire weaponsindiscriminately.   Radio Metropole, meanwhile, said staff at the army generalheadquarters issued a 16-point declaration, setting out theirobjectives for elections, higher pay, medical benefits, subsidizedhousing and commissary privileges.   It appeared the unit was speaking for itself, although theirdemands reflected sentiments expressed earlier by non-commissionedofficers and other enlisted men who carried out the coup.   A demonstration scheduled for Thursday by political groupssupporting the soldier's revolt was canceled after soldiers saidthey could not ensure the safety of the participants.</TEXT></DOC>
