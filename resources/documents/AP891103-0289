The dollar rose on foreign-exchange markets worldwide after theLabor Department reported stronger-than-expected U.S. employmentfigures for October.   The report that nonfarm payroll employment rose 233,000 lastmonth when economists forecast growth of only about 150,000suggested that the economy has unexpected strength and that therewill be no imminent move by the Federal Reserve to encourage lowerinterest rates.   ``The market was sort of stunned,'' said Robert Ryan, vicepresident of foreign-exchange trading at Bank of New York.   But after about an hour of frantic dollar buying, activityslowed and the dollar began backtracking slowly, finishing Europe'strading day at levels mostly lower than had been reached lateThursday.   ``The market's initial reaction to the jobs data was positive,but once the market analyzed the data we realized it stillindicated a weak economy,'' said a London currency dealer.   Ryan said there also were rumors that Japanese authorities mayraise interest rates in Japan in support of the yen, and thatspeculation hurt the dollar as well as other currencies.
