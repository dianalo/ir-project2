For the SPDS project at Grand Gulf NuclearStation, project managers were assigned who have both reactor operationsand EOP development experience, the plant operations department was involvedin all levels of SPDS development, and efforts were coordinated withthe EOP development team to maximize the integration of the two projects.Specific areas of interest include the following. SPDS screens were designedto support large physical sections of the EOP's to minimize screen switchingby the operator. All SPDS parameters, ranges, units, and tables werebased solely on the EOP's. Notes were added to the EOP's at each andevery step which is supported by an SPDS screen. The SPDS keyboard wasmodified extensively to allow single button access to all SPDS screens.All SPDS screens were designed using large (7/16&quot; height) charactersto provide readability from all areas of the control room. Close integrationof SPDS and the EOP's does make implementation more difficult due tothe need to inform both groups prior to making substantive changes, andit will make maintenance of the SPDS and EOP's more difficult since changesin one will necessitate changes in the other. These additional difficultiesare more than offset by the benefits of integration.</TEXT></DOC>
