Gorbachev criticizing him for hishandling of recent ethnic unrest in the Soviet Union, according toa human rights group here.   The Soviet authorities' response to ethnic grievances provesthat ``glasnost appears to be crushed when it is most needed,''wrote the Nobel Prize-winning physicist.   The letter was written last month but never publicized,according to the authoritative Amsterdam-based Bukovsky Foundation,which distributed excerpts of the letter translated into English atits annual Sakharov Conference.   The Moscow-based nuclear physicist, who won the 1975 Nobel PeacePrize, had been invited to the conference named in his honor, butdid not attend the gathering on ``Blank Spots in Soviet History.''   Also on Wednesday, expelled Soviet dissident Vladimir Bukovsky,for whom the foundation is named, predicted that Gorbachev soonwould have to increase consumer prices, and that could lead tounrest in Soviet society.   In his letter, addressed personally to the Soviet leader,Sakharov criticized Gorbachev's handling of recent unrest inAzerbaijan's Nagorno-Karabakh region, where ethnic Armeniansclashed with Azerbaijanis in February.   ``In the context of perestroika, the Armenian population ofKarabakh raised its hopes that there may be a constitutionalsolution to the problem,'' said Sakharov, who was exiled to thecity of Gorky from 1980-86 for criticizing his nation'sintervention in Afghanistan.   ``Glasnost,'' or openness on selected social topics, and``perestroika,'' or restructuring, are key elements of Gorbachev'sprogram of social and economic reforms.   In his letter, Sakharov outlined how the region's Armenians hadsought reunification with the neighboring Soviet republic ofArmenia.   ``Instead of following a normal constitutional means ofexamining the application, Soviet authorities began to rely onmaneuvers and persuasion, directed primarily toward Armenians,''said the letter, which gave no details.   ``At the same time, reports began to appear in the (Soviet)press and on television in which the events were presented in apartial and one-sided fashion, and the lawful requests of theArmenian population were described as being extremist.   ``Thus it seems that a negative answer was preconditioned,''Sakharov's letter said. Dozens of people have died in theNagorno-Karabakh clashes.   According to the Bukovsky Foundation, a lobby group for Sovietdissidents, Gorbachev told Sakharov soon after receiving the letterthat it would be published in the popular English-language weeklyMoscow News if the dissident was willing to ``soften some of hislanguage in the letter.''   Sakharov refused, the foundation's preface to the letter said,adding that the document, signed ``with deep and sincere respect,''was never published.   He also criticized the Soviet leadership for refusing the returnto the Crimea of ethnic Tatars, of whom 238,000 were sent to remoteparts of the Soviet Union after Josef Stalin accused them ofcollaboration with Nazi Germany in 1944.   Earlier Wednesday, Bukovsky predicted that Gorbachev would haveto increase consumer prices by up to 75 percent across the board inthe near future.   ``In the current atmosphere where people are encouraged to voicetheir protests ... it is inevitable that such increase of priceswill lead to industrial unrest and strikes and demonstrations,''Bukovsky said in an interview with The Associated Press.   ``Next year will be a nightmare,'' Bukovsky said, adding therevolt would be a ``dress rehearsal'' for the ultimate collapse ofcommunism.   Bukovsky added that civil and industrial unrest is likely tocontinue also in Poland, Hungary and other East Bloc nations, withSoviet troops unable to quell the disturbances because of theupheavals at home.   Bukovsky, who settled in Britain after his 1976 expulsion fromthe Soviet Union, spent 12 years in Soviet jails and labor camps oncharges of slandering the Soviet state and anti-Soviet agitationand propaganda.</TEXT></DOC>
