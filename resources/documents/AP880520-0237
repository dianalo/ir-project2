Officials moved swiftly to reassure borrowers that the move wasmade to strengthen the billion-dollar Farm Credit Systeminstitution and that it would continue to meet needs of farmers aswell as obligations to those who hold the bank's securities.   ``We have taken this prudent action in order to enable the FarmCredit System to continue to provide a full range of creditservices to the borrowers in the three-state area,'' said astatement from Frank W. Naylor Jr., chairman of the Farm CreditAdministration.   The FCA, the federal agency that regulates the Farm CreditSystem, placed the bank in receivership. The bank and its 90branches in Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana were closedsimultaneously at 5:30 p.m. EDT.   Naylor said the bank, under the management of the receiver,would be open during normal operating hours ``as soon as ispracticable.''   ``The Farm Credit Act of 1971 as amended provides mechanisms toassure that there will be no disruption of payment of principle andinterest on the banks' outstanding securities,'' Naylor said.   The Farm Credit System is a nationwide network of borrower-ownedbanks and lending institutions that has been a prime source ofcredit for American agriculture for decades. Its heavilyspotlighted financial problems led Congress last year to approve amajor bailout bill.   The Jackson bank earlier had received $30 million in assistanceunder bailout legislation to raise funds. But it had been losing$4.7 million a month since the first of the year.   Its loan portfolio at year's end totaled $1.68 billion. As ofMarch 31, 40 percent of that amount represented loans classified asnot performing or at least at high risk. It reported liabilities of$1.909 billion.   Ronald E. Watkins, head of REW Enterprises Inc., Jackson, wasnamed receiver. His company issued a letter to customers sayingthat ``every available effort will be made to continue serving ...all borrowers.''   House Agriculture Committee Chairman E. (Kika) de la Garza,D-Texas, issued a statement calling it ``unfortunate that thesituation in regard to the Jackson Federal Land Bank has come tothis stage.''   ``But I have been assured by FCA personnel that the liquidationprocedure will be similar to the procedure that the Federal DepositInsurance Corporation uses when closing a commercial bank,'' de laGarza said. ``In fact, FDIC personnel are assisting with theliquidation arrangements today.''   ``Borrower stock and rights will be protected and operationswill begin almost immediately under a new bank structure,'' hesaid. He added that he had been ``assured that other banks willassist in providing necessary credit so that there will be nointerruption in providing for the needs of farmers.''   The assistance board set up under last year's bailoutlegislation recommended placing the bank in receivership, accordingto an FCA statement.   ``Borrower stock is protected by the recently passedAgricultural Credit Act of 1987 and will be retired by the receiverwith funds provided under that act,'' Naylor said.</TEXT></DOC>
