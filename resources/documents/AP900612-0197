(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal judge ordered an oil tankerimpounded Tuesday so that New Jersey, New York and New York Citycan guarantee that the vessels owner pay for damages resulting fromlast week's 260,000-gallon oil spill.   ``This order gives us the power to prevent them from moving theship until we're satisfied,'' said Gordon Johnson, an assistantattorney general for the state of New York.   Johnson said Govs. Jim Florio of New Jersey and Mario Cuomo ofNew York decided to seek the impoundment of the vessel becauseofficials received word that the ship BT Nautilus could be ready tomove as early as Wednesday from Bayonne, where it was dockingThursday when it ran aground.   Charles Anderson, a New York City attorney representing the811-foot ship's owners, Nautilus Motor Tanker Co. of London,characterized U.S. District Judge Nicholas Politan's order asroutine in maritime cases..   Anderson said the ship was under repair and no decisions havebeen made on moving it. He said the company's underwriters areworking on posting a bond to guarantee payment of cleanup costs.   Workers collected about 100 gallons of oil waste that washed upalong a five-mile stretch of Sandy Hook beach Tuesday, includingthree miles of beaches where swimming is normally permitted,according to the National Parks Service. The beach was clean by 5p.m., said parks service spokesman Manny Strumpf.   The Coast Guard has not determined the cause of the grounding.   Navigational charts of the area where the BT Nautilus ranaground are accurate, and the accident would not have occurred ifthe ship had been following the proper route, said Capt. RobertNorth, coordinator of the cleanup.   A grand jury is to meet this week to consider charges that thetanker's first mate, Gregory Frederick Geoffrey, 52, of New Marske,England, was operating a vessel while intoxicated, said ChristopherFlorentz, a spokesman for the New Jersey attorney general's office.   The Coast Guard said tests of the captain, Albert Ainscough, andthe pilot, Jim Naughton, showed no traces of drug or alcohol use.   The BT Nautilus ran aground while being docked, ripping a30-foot-long gash in its hull and pouring 260,000 gallons of No. 6industrial heating oil into the Kill van Kull, a busy waterwayseparating Bayonne from the New York City borough of Staten Island.   Attorneys for New York and New Jersey argued that the captainand crew were ``incompetent, inattentive, reckless and otherwisegrossly negligent in their duties, which resulted in the generalunseaworthiness of the BT Nautilus.'' That condition caused the``illegal discharge of oil,'' according to papers filed in federalcourt.   Anderson said the allegations were ``totally unfounded,'' andnoted that the cause of the investigation remained underinvestigation.   The spill was the fourth major one in the waterway and nearbyArthur Kill this year.</TEXT></DOC>
