The major maker of business machines unveiled computersoftware that enables traveling businessmen and businesswomento contact their personal computers through fax machines fromremote locations.</LP><TEXT>   Dubbed PaperWorks, the software allows users to retrieve,store, distribute and organize documents without having to benear their personal computers -- all on a single sheet of faxpaper.   &quot;It's technologically backwards, but socially veryusable,&quot; said Esther Dyson, editor of Release 1.0, a NewYork-based computer industry newsletter.   Several companies have developed software in recent yearsthat integrates personal computers with fax machines to carryout various business tasks. Cardiff Software Inc. of Solana,Calif., recently began shipping Teleform for Windows, asoftware that allows computers to send customized forms viafax machines; the forms can then be returned to the computerby fax machine after they are filled out.   Similarly, but with a new wrinkle, the Xerox software letsusers manipulate a personal computer by sending a singlesheet of paper to the computer. Users make check marks with apen or a pencil in boxes on the sheet and then fax the formto their PC, which carries out the instructions.   The instructions could be as simple as asking the computerto retrieve a stored document or as complicated as having thePC distribute several different documents to a number ofdifferent people. To retrieve a document, for example, theuser indicates the document to be accessed, then faxes theform to the computer. The software then automatically returnsthe selected document to the fax machine. Distributingdocuments would work in a similiar manner but the documentrequested would be sent to other fax machines.   There is a catch, however. The software can be used onlywith Microsoft Corp.'s Windows program, and the computer hasto have a fax board installed that allows computers to dialup fax machines.   Xerox, based in Stamford, Conn., said that so far thereare only about 150,000 owners of computers with equipmentcapable of running the software. But Xerox asserted that thesoftware could widen the market for the fax equipment and inturn boost sales of the software. The software, developed atXerox's Palo Alto, Calif., research center, is priced at$249.95.</TEXT></DOC>
