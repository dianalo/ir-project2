As the House-Senate conference on the $166 billion legislation worked into the night, negotiators agreed to force thrifts to divest themselves of any non-investment grade bonds and direct equity investments within five years. Sandamp;Ls could sell junk bonds to outside investors or to separately capitalized affiliates, while direct equity investments would be sold to outside investors.    These agreements are the latest in a series of provisions that toughen accounting regulations for Sandamp;Ls and restrict their operations to more closely resemble those of national banks.    Yesterday's approval of the provisions, which were contained in a Senate compromise proposal, also was a victory for Senate conferees, who have conceded to their House counterparts on a long list of provisions. &quot;We would like a few shreds of skin on our skeletons when we return to the Senate,&quot; said Sen. John Heinz (R., Pa.). Conferees said they expect to wrap up their work on the landmark bill this week.    The House-passed bill would have banned investment in junk bonds, while the Senate's would have maintained current law allowing junk bonds to constitute 11% of a thrift's portfolio.    Thrifts hold billions of dollars of junk bonds -- high-risk investments that as part of Sandamp;L portfolios are backed by federal deposit insurance, and ultimately the taxpayer. Selling the junk bonds to outsiders or separately capitalized affiliates would insulate the federal insurance fund from the risk.    Although a recent General Accounting Office study determined that junk bonds have yet to contribute significantly to thrift failures, many economists predict that an economic downturn could topple thrifts with large holdings of junk bonds.    The biggest issue still to be determined is how the huge bailout package will be financed. When the conferees take up the issue today, the Senate will continue pushing the Bush administration's plan to raise $50 billion through industry bonds, with only the interest payments of more than $100 billion to be included on the federal budget.    The House would raise the cash with Treasury bonds, which would carry a lower interest rate but would require an exemption from the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. Administration officials this week said they would recommend a presidential veto if the conference rejects the Bush funding plan.    In deliberations yesterday, the conferees spent nearly an hour determining the future of one person: Danny Wall, the embattled chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. In the end, the House acquiesced to the Senate, preserving Mr. Wall's post as top thrift regulator and maintaining the revamped Bank Board's role as regulator of state-chartered Sandamp;Ls. &quot;These two issues are fundamental to our view of this bill,&quot; said Sen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.    The House bill would have substantially curtailed the thrift regulator's authority by transferring oversight of state-chartered thrifts to bank regulators. The House also would have required another Senate confirmation hearing for Mr. Wall, who has incurred lawmakers' wrath for underestimating the cost of the thrift crisis.    The negotiators also tentatively agreed that thrifts will have to maintain capital -- which serves as a cash cushion against losses -- equal to at least 1.5% of assets. Mortgage-servicing rights, contracts under which thrifts collect payments and otherwise administer mortgages originated by others, could count toward the 1.5% in proportions to be determined by federal regulators.    Under a compromise, the tougher capital standards would take effect four months after passage of the bill. Enforcement actions against thrifts that don't meet capital standards, such as limitations on growth, would be effective Jan. 1, 1991.    Conferees also adopted language raising to 70% from 60% the level of investments a thrift must maintain in mortgage-related assets in order to qualify for low-interest advances from the home loan bank system and tax breaks. </TEXT></DOC>
