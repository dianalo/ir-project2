First, the water tended to be expelled from the targetby radiolytic gas production and second, continued use of the targetgave [/sup 18/F]fluoride which could not be used for organic synthesisdue to metal ions dissolving in the target water. Both of these problemshave been overcome by using a silver target with a head space that permitsthe gas to leave the target without removing water.</TEXT></DOC>
