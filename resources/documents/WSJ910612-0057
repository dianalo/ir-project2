The new amplifiers, which underscore the intensecompetition among U.S., Japanese and European researchers toperfect communications via light beams, use special flourideglass fibers treated with the rare earth praseodymium.</LP><TEXT>   Researchers said the new amplifiers boosted the signalstrength from a communications laser more than 1,000 times.In addition, the signal gain was accomplished at wavelengthsof 1.3 microns -- the wavelength at which most fiber-opticcommunications systems operate today.   &quot;We can retrofit these devices onto existing systemsinstead of pulling the older fiber systems out of theground,&quot; said George H. Sigel Jr., director of the FiberOptics Materials Research Program at Rutgers, Piscataway,N.J., and a member of the scientific team. The amplifieritself was invented by Elias Snitzer, a Rutgers professor andpioneer in optical amplification using rare earths, andYasutake Ohishi, an NTT scientist.   Scientists such as Mr. Snitzer have shown that a fiberwhen treated with certain rare earths and spliced to aregular fiber will act as its own signal booster. AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph Co.'s Bell Laboratories and NTT haveperfected systems that use the rare-earth erbium to turn thefiber into a self-amplifier.   Such systems are expected to be far less costly to buildand maintain since they would eliminate the need foradditional electrical conversion equipment to refire a signaland turn it back into light before sending it to the nextbooster on the cable and repeating the whole process.   However, erbium amplification is targeted for futurelong-distance fiber-optic communication systems operating atwavelengths of 1.5 microns. &quot;If you want to upgrade existingsystems you need to build a system that operates at 1.3microns,&quot; said Anders Olsson, chief of Bell Labs' Solid Stateand Quantum Optics Research Department. &quot;We are doing work onpraseodymium.&quot; He called the NTT-Rutgers claim &quot;significant.&quot;   NTT and Rutgers researchers say the new amplifiers couldcost one-tenth to build and maintain as conventional systems-- a claim that Mr. Olsson called &quot;a nonsense statement&quot;since they haven't actually built a commercial system tocompare with conventional ones. But he agrees the costsshould drop sharply.   While Mr. Sigel is optimistic that such systems will findtheir way to the market within three years, he said that muchwork remains before the systems can be called commerciallyviable.   &quot;The downside here is that we were using a very intenselight source,&quot; a titanium sapphire laser that is bulky andvery expensive to fire up, said Mr. Sigel. &quot;That's notacceptable in the real world. You need a more efficient wayto pump the light.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
