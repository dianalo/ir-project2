Foreign sales were suspended in January and February because of a strike at Noranda's Horne smelter in Quebec, which began in November.    Noranda said production at the smelter by management personnel, along with purchased feedstock, will enable it to partially fulfill March contracts. Noranda declined to comment on the value of foreign copper contracts, though it said foreign sales represent about half of total sales from its main refinery in Montreal. </TEXT></DOC>
