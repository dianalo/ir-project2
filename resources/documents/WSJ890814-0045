Chairman Bernard L. Schwartz, in buying two big divisions from his company, has found an attractive second job.    Mr. Schwartz bought Loral's Aircraft Braking Systems and Engineered Fabrics divisions for $455 million in a leveraged buy-out last spring. The purchase was &quot;a long-term investment,&quot; he said. He put up $10 million and got a 35% stake and board control of the acquired units, now operating under the name Kandamp;F Industries Inc.    The 63-year-old chairman isn't waiting long to reap rewards from his new investment. Mr. Schwartz and four other Loral executives will receive $200,000 a month in &quot;advisory&quot; fees from Kandamp;F, with the largest share going to Mr. Schwartz. That will be in addition to his Loral paycheck, which last year totaled $1.7 million. If Mr. Schwartz spends the 10 hours a month he estimates will be required of him as chairman of Kandamp;F, his Kandamp;F compensation would work out to at least $4,000 an hour.    Meanwhile, the acquired divisions are running losses and may have to borrow money to pay interest on loans used in the purchase. The businesses were profitable prior to the effects of the buy-out financing.    These details were disclosed in a prospectus for a $210 million subordinated debenture sale that closed last week and were elaborated on in an interview with Mr. Schwartz. Despite dire warnings in the prospectus, Mr. Schwartz argued that Kandamp;F is treading on firm financial ground. &quot;In my view, the leveraged structure here is well within the ability of Kandamp;F to manage,&quot; Mr. Schwartz said.    He also defended the &quot;advisory&quot; fees, saying that Loral's board would consider the Kandamp;F payments in determining the size of any &quot;discretionary bonuses.&quot; Last year Mr. Schwartz's compensation from Loral included $750,000 in base salary, $400,000 in incentive pay and a $500,000 bonus &quot;in recognition of his contribution to the company's outstanding performance&quot; the previous year, the proxy statement said. Mr. Schwartz is Loral's largest shareholder, with 5.7% of the stock.    Kandamp;F will be making additional payments to members of Mr. Schwartz's family. Mr. Schwartz appointed the husbands of a niece and a daughter to Kandamp;F's board, and a nephew will be chief financial officer. Their compensation hasn't been determined yet, Mr. Schwartz said.    To refinance part of the $455 million cost of buying the Loral divisions, Mr. Schwartz and his investing group sold the $210 million of junk-bond-rate debentures with a 13.75% coupon through Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.    In a provision analysts said is typical of junk-bond offerings, the prospectus said there can be &quot;no assurance&quot; that the company will be able to meet terms of its bank credit agreement or generate enough cash flow to cover the required interest and principal payments.    The two units were profitable when they were part of Loral, a defense electronics company; they posted net income of $28.6 million for the year ended March 31 on $312 million in sales. But on a pro-forma basis reflecting acquisition, financing and other costs, the units had a loss of $15.8 million for the year, including $58.9 million in interest expense.    Besides Mr. Schwartz's 35% share, Kandamp;F is 61.75%-owned by Shearson and some limited partners. Bank lenders hold 3.25% of the stock.    Mr. Schwartz acquired the Loral businesses after an auction in April in which his sweetened $455 million offer was topped by a bid of $467 million from Banner Industries Inc., Cleveland. However, a $17 million breakup fee that Loral had originally agreed to pay to Mr. Schwartz's group, in the event the divisions were sold to another party, made the Banner offer less attractive.    Banner and some Loral holders have since filed lawsuits in state court here seeking damages, a decree nullifying the sale and a new auction. The suits accuse Loral and its outside directors of managing the auction so as to guarantee Mr. Schwartz's purchase of the divisions. The company and Mr. Schwartz dispute the charges in the suits.    The prospectus said the new company has a $100 million revolving-credit arrangement to help service its debt, fund capital spending and provide working capital. Through Aug. 1, 1993, a maximum of $25 million of the credit line may be used to pay interest on the debentures.    Loral isn't recognizing any gain on the sale of the two divisions, and Mr. Schwartz said they were sold because they didn't fit in with Loral's defense electronics businesses. Loral acquired Aircraft Braking, based in Akron, Ohio, and Engineered Fabrics, based in Rockmart, Ga., in its $588 million purchase of Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber Co.'s aerospace unit in 1987. Before Mr. Schwartz bid for the units, he had tried for two years to sell them.    He said he decided to purchase the companies to keep them &quot;within the family of Loral culture.&quot;    Mr. Schwartz, a Brooklyn native, came to Loral as chairman in 1972 when the company was riddled with losses in businesses ranging from toys to wire. Beefing up the defense electronics businesses and shedding everything else, Mr. Schwartz has led Loral through 17 consecutive years of record earnings. In the latest year ended March 31, Loral earned $87.6 million on sales of $1.2 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
