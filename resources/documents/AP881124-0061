For most Americans, Thanksgiving heralded a traditional feast ofplates overflowing with turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing and gravy,and enough football to keep armchair athletes fixed for hours.   Pageant-filled parades snaked down the streets of New York,Philadelphia, and Detroit today to mark the start of the holidayseason.   In New York, about 4,000 American Indians and descendants ofPilgrims were expected to join in a circle dance of friendship atthe Cathedral of St. John the Divine tonight, 367 years after theWampanoag Indians and the Pilgrims gathered for their historicpeace-feast in Plymouth, Mass.   ``It should be an amazing moment,'' said the Rev. James ParksMorton. ``We, the boat people, will be thanking the natives forgiving us Thanksgiving.''   ``They tried to stamp out our ways, to destroy our culture,''said Oren Lyons, chief of the Onondagas who will be joined at theceremony by leaders of the Hopi, Northern Cheyenne, Tewa Pueblo andother tribes.   ``So we come to 1988, and people are realizing the validity oftraditional Indian ways in northern America. When people comeforward and say `We're sorry, we don't think we did right,' that'svery significant.''   On the lighter side, the 62nd annual Macy's Thanksgiving DayParade in New York dazzled up to 2 million spectators lining theparade route plus an estimated 80 million television viewers with 24floats, 14 marching bands, hundreds of clowns, and the usual giantballoons of cartoon characters towering five to six stories tall.   Included in the lineup were new balloons, such as Snoopy'sfeatured friend, Woodstock, the Pink Panther and Quik Bunny, thespeediest rabbit on the Earth.   The world's fastest woman, Florence Griffith Joyner, was amongthose signed up to join in, along with crooner Frankie Valli, andthe Osmond Boys, sons of the original Osmond Brothers.   Philadelphia's 69th annual Thanksgiving parade, the nation'soldest, featured floats and balloons, soap opera stars and MissAmerica, Gretchen Elizabeth Carlson.   In Houston, Foley's 39th annual Thanksgiving Day Parade wasmarching into its fourth decade with Alan Thicke of ``GrowingPains'' serving as commentator.   In Detroit, about 750,000 spectators were expected to enjoy sunnyskies and temperatures in the mid-40s and low 50s to watch thecity's 2{-hour parade.   But much of the nation wasn't as lucky when it came to theweather.   A Pacific storm left up to 4 feet of snow in the Sierra Nevada,and West Yellowstone, Mont., had 22 inches of snow as of 7 a.m. Rainfell along the northern and central West Coast, with snow in themountains, and snow fell from the Rockies to the western Dakotas.One traffic death in Oregon was blamed on icy roads and two peopledied in the Los Angeles area when a truck overturned on a wethighway.   In Florida, Tropical Storm Keith moved into the Atlantic aftercrossing the state, leaving twisted mobile homes and flooded roadsbut no major damage or casualties.   Victims of the weather were among those being helped today.   In Scott, Ark., grocer Bill Cotham planned to feed 150 peoplewhose homes were damaged or destroyed in tornadoes last week thatkilled six.   ``Some people are still so in shock about the weather damage, wejust wanted to help them this little bit,'' said Cotham.   At the Los Angeles Mission, actors Harry Hamlin and Rita Morenojoined 400 volunteers Wednesday to pass out turkey helpings to thehomeless.   ``There's no question that we have to all pitch in,'' Hamlin said.   The area's homeless were offered hotel vouchers through Sundaynight.   An estimated 18,000 homeless people in Atlanta were expected tofeast on turkey with all the trimmings today in an annual citywideoutpouring of charity.   In Philadelphia, 25,000 senior citizens and homeless enjoyedMinnie Moore's annual Thanksgiving dinner Wednesday.   In Indianapolis, hundreds of volunteers and the hungry planned topause today to remember the late Rev. Mozel Sanders, who startedtheir annual Thanksgiving Dinner Program in 1972.   In San Antonio, Texas, hundreds of tables were set to feed 13,000senior citizens expected to enjoy the hospitality at the annualJimenez Thanksgiving Dinner.   On the football fields, the Detroit Lions were playing in their49th annual Thanksgiving Day game, this year against the MinnesotaVikings.
