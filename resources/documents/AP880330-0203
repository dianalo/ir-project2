The bill, which faces an uncertain future in the House, alsowould establish a $1 billion fund to clean up or stablize large,mildly radioactive piles of uranium tailings at 26 sites in sevenWestern states. The cost would be shared equally by uranium millowners, nuclear utilities and the government.   Among its more controversial provisions, the legislation _ whichtook six years to clear the Senate _ would:   _Impose a schedule of escalating fees on nuclear utilities thatload their reactors with more than 37.5 percent foreign uranium.Beginning in 1995, however, utilities could buy up to half theiruranium from foreign suppliers without penalty. Opponents,including Sens. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., and Daniel Evans, R-Wash.,argued that this would violate the spirit of the recent free tradepact signed with Canada, a leading exporter of relativelyinexpensive, high-grade ore. Bradley and Evans lost an attempt,47-45, to delete the import restrictions from the bill.   _Settle the nuclear industry's debt to the U.S. treasury forpast purchases of enriched uranium at $364 million. Opponentsargued that the figure should be as high as $8.8 billion.   _Convert the Department of Energy's uranium enrichment program,supposedly self-financing but a multibillion-dollar loser since themid-1970s, into a corporation owned by the government. If and whenthe enterprise begins turning profits, the treasury could sell thestock in a bid to recover previous investments.   Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, D-La., who guided the measure throughhis Energy Committee, said it is ``the culmination of six years oflegislative effort to fashion a sound, sensible and well-balancedprogram to address the challenges we face today in the uraniumindustry and the nuclear fuel cycle.   ``We're not here to debate the Canadian trade deal,'' Johnstonsaid. ``Let's keep American jobs at home.''   He estimated the bill would restore 20,000 jobs in the uraniummining industry, which has dwindled in this decade to 2,000 workersat just three mines. And he estimated the uranium enrichmentworkforce, cut by half since 1980, could be restored to at least12,000 jobs.   The National Taxpayers Union, the Environmental PolicyInstitute, the Union of Concerned Scientists, the U.S. PublicInterest Research Group and Environmental Action all opposed keyprovisions of the bill, particularly the feature which limits thegovernment's recovery of uranium enrichment costs to $364 million.   The groups argued that charging just $364 million is anunprecedented bailout for the nuclear industry since the WhiteHouse has estimated that the industry should be billed $3 billionand the General Accounting Office said the government should charge$8.8 billion.   The 1954 Atomic Energy Act required the government to be fullycompensated for its enrichment of nuclear fuel used by commercialutilities.   Enrichment is a critical process in nuclear power. It involvesincreasing the percentage of fissionable material in naturaluranium from 0.7 percent to about 3 percent, the amount necessaryfor use in light-water reactors.   When the government began enriching commercial fuel in 1969, theUnited States was the only free-world supplier of the service fornuclear utilities and business was booming. Predictions ofburgeoning demand led to the expansion of the three DOE plants,and, even then, all capacity was committeed.   But then came a drastic decline in the demand for nuclear power,with utilities canceling plans for more than 100 additionalreactors since the late 1970s. Meanwhile, two European consortiumsand the Soviet Union began to supply foreign utilities withenriched uranium, and by the 1980s, the U.S. monopoly had droppedto 50 percent of the market. Even some U.S. utilities found itcheaper to buy foreign uranium.   Adding to the government enrichment program's woes was the factthat the Energy Department contracted with the Tennessee ValleyAuthority for billions of dollars worth of electricity to operateits production plants. But when demand fell off, that electrictywasn't used _ even though TVA charged for it anyway. The Senatelegislation settles that long-term debt at $1.2 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
