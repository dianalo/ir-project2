Background</ITAG>One of the primary purposes of this rulemaking is to revise the AGAR, asnecessary, to incorporate labor standards provisions applicable to Departmentalcontracts for services. USDA has been operating under instructions containedin the Federal Acquisition Circular 84-1 to follow policy and procedurescontained in Federal Procurement Regulations (FPR), Temporary Regulation76, for labor standards coverage applicable to Federal service contracts.The FPR Temporary Regulation has expired.There are other items within this proposed rule which will revise the blanketauthority delegated to heads of contracting activities to acquire ADP resources;add policy and procedures for conducting cost-plus-award-fee contracts;and add uniform provisions and clauses for use under the Department's ContractAutomation System.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Procedural Requirements</ITAG>A. Executive Order 12291The Executive order entitled ``Federal Regulations'' requires that certainregulations be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) priorto their promulgation. OMB Bulletin 85-7 exempts all but certain typesof procurement regulations from such review. This proposed rule does notinvolve any of the topics requiring prior review under the bulletin andis accordingly exempt from such review.B. Regulatory Flexibility ActThis proposed rule was reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of1980, Pub. L. 96-354, which requires preparation of a regulatory flexibilityanalysis for any rule which is likely to have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities. This rule will have no impacton interest rates, tax policies or liabilities, the costs of goods or services,or other direct economic factors. It will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities, and therefore, no regulatoryflexibility analysis has been prepared.C. Paperwork Reduction ActAll information collections contained in 48 CFR Subpart 422.70 are thedirect result of Department of Labor (DOL) rules as published in 29 CFRPart 4. The DOL rules have been cleared by the Office of Management andBudget (OMB) and assigned the OMB control numbers shown therein. All otherinformation collections contained in this AGAR amendment have been clearedby OMB in prior rulemaking or as declared by USDA in its information collectionrequests. For example, the information collections relative to the submissionof contract proposals in section 415.407 have been declared and clearedpreviously as contract specific collections. This revised rule merely consolidatesa range of information that contracting officers should, at their discretion,consider asking prospective contractors to furnish.D. National Environmental Policy ActUSDA has concluded that promulgation of this rule would not represent amajor Federal action having a significant impact on the human environmentunder the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 432,<T3>et seq., </T3>1976), or the Council on Environmental Quality regulations(40 CFR Part 1020), and therefore does not require an environmental impactstatement or an environmental assessment pursuant to NEPA.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Public Comments</ITAG>Interested persons are invited to participate in this rule making by submittingviews and comments with respect to the proposed AGAR amendment set forthin this notice. All written comments will be carefully assessed and fullyconsidered prior to publication of the final rule.<ITAG tagnum="85">List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 404, 407, 409, 410, 412, 414, 415,416, 417, 419, 422, 424, 425, 428, 432, 436, 437, 439, 442, 445, 446, 447,and 452.</ITAG>Government procurement.For the reasons set out in this preamble, the Department proposes to amendChapter 4 of Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
