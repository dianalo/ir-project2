Chief Inspector Kierie du Rand said the territorial police forcehas formed three anti-poaching units to try to fill the voidcreated after nearly all South African troops left earlier thisyear as part of a U.N.-supervised plan to bring independence toNamibia.   He said the units consisted mainly of black constables whoformerly served in Koevoet, a counterinsurgency force active in the23-year bush war against guerrillas of SWAPO, the South-West AfricaPeople's Organization. Many Koevoet members were expert trackers.   Police have reported the arrest of 30 suspected poachers in thepast six weeks, but wildlife experts say stronger measures areneeded to halt the smuggling of ivory and rhino horns out ofNamibia.   According to the South African-based Rhino and ElephantFoundation, at least 11 black rhinos and 30 elephants have beenkilled by poachers in Namibia since June. The black rhino is one ofthe most endangered species of large mammals, with only about 3,500believed to exist worldwide.   Two months ago, Namibian conservationists began an unprecedentedexperimental program to deter rhino poachers by removing the hornsof some of the animals. The horns can earn thousands of dollars forsmugglers from buyers in Asia who use them to make potions anddagger handles.   Some conservationists have complained that the U.N. military andpolice contingents observing the independence process in Namibiaare uninterested in assisting wildlife protection programs.   The poaching issue was among several topics discussed Fridayduring talks in Pretoria between South African Foreign Minister PikBotha and U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar.   South Africa, which took control of Namibia during World War I,has agreed to grant independence as part of a regional peace accordthat also calls for withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola,Namibia's northern neighbor.</TEXT></DOC>
