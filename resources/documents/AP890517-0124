Chief Judge Heiner Mueckenberger gave the Lebanese Shiite Moslemthe maximum penalty for the 1985 hijacking and the brutal beatingand murder of Robert Stethem, 23, of Waldorf, Md. West Germany hasno death penalty.   Hamadi's trial provided a rare look into the planning andexecution of a major terrorist attack, plus chilling witnesstestimony of the terror and brutality aboard the seized aircraft.   During the ordeal, 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days.   The parents of the slain Navy diver, breaking the silence theyhad kept throughout the 10-month trial, said death would have beena more appropriate penalty for the 24-year-old terrorist.   ``Our family maintains Mohammed Ali Hamadi deserves punishmentmore severe than allowable under German law,'' Richard L. Stethemsaid.   But the couple said the West German court conducted a fair andimpartial trial. They warned, however, against the ``possiblepolitical commutation'' of Hamadi's sentence.   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said thatwhile ``we would have preferred extradition'' to the United States,``we were satisfied and gratified by the outcome.   ``We expect he will serve his full sentence in accordance withGerman law,'' Fitzwater said.   Peter Korneck, one of the prosecutors, said Hamadi will beeligible for a parole review in 15 years. Hamadi's defense lawyerssaid they expected to appeal the sentence.   The Stethems attended all of the trial's 65 sessions since itbegan July 5, 1988.   ``Our purpose for being there was to represent our son. Ithought he deserved that. With all his bravery I felt he deservedmore than that,'' Patricia Stethem said, her voice quaking withemotion.   Mueckenberger announced the verdict and sentence to a packedcourtroom inside the fortress-like Preungesheim prison in Frankfurt.   The judge said the court found Hamadi guilty of ``jointparticipation in murder'' in the killing of Stethem, who was shotin the head.   During the trial, Hamadi denied shooting Stethem, saying thebullet was fired by his accomplice, Hassan Ezzeddine, who remains afugitive.   Hamadi confessed to the hijacking charge shortly after the trialbegan.   TWA Flight 847 was seized on June 14, 1985, after the Boeing 727took off from Athens for Rome. The plane flew twice to Algiers andthree times to Beirut on the hijackers' orders.   Stethem was shot and thrown onto the runway to die when theplane landed the second time in Beirut on June 15, 1985.   The judge described Stethem as ``tall, strong, well-built,self-confident, good-looking man with a military posture.'' He saidHamadi took Stethem to the front of the plane, tied his hands,blindfolded him and threw him to the floor shortly before thesailor was shot.   Mueckenberger said the court was unable to decide who actuallyshot Stethem.   ``But the defendant knowingly and willingly participated inStethem's killing and actively took part in its preparation,'' hesaid.   The judge said Hamadi was an ``active member'' of Hezbollah, aradical Shiite Moslem group backed by Iran that is believed to holdWestern hostages in Lebanon.   Mueckenberger said he did not believe a milder sentence wouldhave changed Hamadi's convictions. ``We think he would return tolive in his homeland and again join Hezbollah. He identifies withHezbollah's aims of terrorism and violence.''   During the proceedings, Hamadi had testified that the goal ofthe hijacking was to force the release of Lebanese Moslemsimprisoned in Israel. Shortly after the ordeal ended, Israelreleased about 700 such prisoners.   Hamadi also was convicted of hostage-taking and three counts ofcausing grievous bodily harm in the beatings of Stethem and twoother American passengers, Clinton Suggs and Kurt Carlson ofRockford, Ill. Suggs is a native of Elkhart, Ind.   He was also found guilty on two counts of smuggling explosivesinto West Germany. Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport on Jan.13, 1987, when customs officials found such explosives in hisluggage.</TEXT></DOC>
