Unlike the collapsed Communist dictatorships in EasternEurope, Vietnam's aging party leadership is expected tocontinue the program of economic reform while allowing onlycautious political liberalization, according to a variety ofofficial and private sources. The party also is expected torejuvenate its aging leadership by promoting younger andmore-qualified members, though septuagenarians are likely tokeep the top posts. In other words, business as usual.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This isn't a turning point,&quot; says Do Duc Dinh, a42-year-old economist and party member. &quot;This is the placewhere people look to see whether we go faster or slower&quot; withreforms.   A congress of the Communist Party, held every five yearsor so, is crucial in Vietnam. It sets the country's overallcourse, formalizes policies and gives leaders the seal ofapproval. It was the sixth congress, held in December 1986,that saw a radical departure from Marxism-Leninism and theadoption of &quot;doi moi&quot;, the local version of perestroika. Theparty, which has run northern Vietnam for 37 years and thereunited country for 15 years, admitted it had been on thewrong track for a decade and began shifting from centralplanning to a market economy. It also embraced limitedpolitical reform.   Since then, Hanoi has watched apprehensively as Communistregimes collapsed in Europe, and China answered a challengeto party dominance by violently crushing a democracy movementin Tiananmen Square. Vietnam repeatedly has declared that,unlike its mentor the Soviet Union, it won't tolerate rivalparties.   Although its structural reforms have been praised by theInternational Monetary Fund, Vietnam remains one of theworld's poorest countries. It's now struggling to cope with asharp reduction in Soviet aid and is plagued by unemployment,corruption and smuggling.   On the eve of the seventh congress, the consensus is thatthe economic reform process is irreversible. Many Vietnameseare looking to the congress to boost the process. Localbankers and businessmen say they hope delegates willestablish a legal framework for a market economy, bolster theprivate sector and introduce a body of commercial law. Othercontentious topics include the complex matter of land leasingand ownership, and giving party cadres the right to engage inprivate business.   The biggest change is likely to be in the leadership.Party sources believe that as much as 60% of both thePolitburo, whose average age is 71, and the policy-makingCentral Committee will be replaced.   While younger people and technocrats will be promoted, thesources question whether that will make much difference. Atleast a few of the elderly leaders will stay on at the verytop to provide continuity, the sources say, and the currentoffice holders, including those who will retire, are the onesdeciding policies to be endorsed by the congress.   The party also is committed to further measures toseparate itself from the state. Tran Bach Dang, an adviser toparty chief Nguyen Van Linh, confirms that the nation'sconstitution will be altered to provide for the separation ofpowers after the congress has given its approval. &quot;The partywill lead, but it won't do the work of the government,&quot; hesays.   Mr. Dang adds that the National Assembly, which meets onlytwice a year, will become more professional and acquire realclout. In addition to meeting regularly, it will excludeministers from its ranks. Indeed, it will gain the right toreject any ministerial appointment proposed by the primeminister.   In next year's National Assembly elections, every citizenwill have the right to run -- the last time, they had to beapproved -- and nobody will insist that the majority ofcandidates be Communists.   Yearlong preparations for the congress have included anunprecedented public debate on the country's future. To closethe admitted gap between the party and the people, thegovernment has published drafts of major documents to bepresented to the congress and invited comment.   While Communist Party branches have been choosingdelegates and defining positions to represent the party'smore than two million members at the conclave, the rest ofthe 67.5 million population has been expressing its views inpetitions, letters and newspaper articles. Hundreds ofthousands of submissions have poured in, most of themcritical.   &quot;The biggest problem,&quot; says an official, &quot;is how toreconcile all the opinions.&quot; Evidence indicates the partywill solve that problem by simply ignoring most of them.Vietnam's leaders seem to have gotten more than they wantedwhen they opened the debate in the interests of &quot;democracy.&quot;   Some people have advocated changing both the name of theCommunist Party and the country, which is formally called theSocialist Republic of Vietnam, to remove the &quot;communist&quot; and&quot;socialist&quot; tags. Those recommendations have been rejected,insiders say. Socialism is Vietnam's &quot;inevitable path,&quot;declared Radio Hanoi, as part of an orchestrated campaign toset limits on the debate.</TEXT></DOC>
