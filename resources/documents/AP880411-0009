The shanty town, a half mile from the ruins of the colonial citysacked and burned by pirate Henry Morgan in 1671, has swollenrapidly since 60 families ``invaded'' the privately-owned landbefore dawn on March 25.   Their takeover is a headache for the regime of Gen. ManuelAntonio Noriega and a dramatic example of the devastation thenation's crisis has wrought on the poor, most of whom livedhand-to-mouth even in the best of times.   Noriega, as head of the 15,000-member Defense Forces, is thepower behind the civilian government. After Noriega was indicted ondrug trafficking charges in the United States, Washington imposedeconomic sanctions on Panama, hoping its action and months of civilunrest would oust Noriega. Although the sanctions have bankruptedthe nation's economy, Noriega remains in power.   ``We were obliged by necessity to act,'' said Marcelino deGracia, one of five organizers of the takeover. Each of thesquatter familes has staked out a 10-by-15 yard plot with rope,wire, ribbon or knotted strips of cloth.   De Gracia, a 29-year-old unemployed tire salesman, lives withhis wife Yadilia and their two infant children in a shanty made ofmangrove poles, cardboard, a shower curtain, palm fronds and asheet of corrugated zinc. It, like hundreds of other shacks spreadover the seized 30 acres, is built on reclaimed land that until twoyears ago was a garbage dump.   The indigent community is bordered by a foul-smelling tidewatertributary on which float bloated fish poisoned by raw sewage.   Part of the camp was carved out of an auto graveyard. The rustedbodies and tattered interiors provide building materials,furnishings and a tetanus trap for the approximately 3,000 childrenliving there.   The dump has fostered a local population of raccoons, which haveaugmented the squatters' diet. Skins were tacked on the walls ofseveral shacks.   De Gracia said camp dwellers dig clams on the edge of theirsettlement and catch lizards and armadillos as well as thering-tailed mammals.   ``Nothing gets out of here alive,'' he said. ``Whack, and intothe pot.''   De Gracia said a census shows about 570 families comprisingalmost 4,000 people lived in the camp as of April 4.   They draw water from seven faucets along a dirt road borderingthe camp, which sits off Avenida Cincuentenario about five mileseast of downtown.   Elma Sierra, Olivia Ramos and Anastasia Vega stood around asmoky campfire in front of Ms. Sierra's shack. Rice boiled in ablackened pot.   ``Arroz `pelado,''' (`bald' rice), she said disparagingly, usingthe slang for the grain unaccompanied by beans or meat. ``We don'tknow what beans look like any more.'' This rice was donated by anearby church.   The three women, all on their own, have 11 children among them.They said many recent arrivals are single mothers.   Ms. Ramos admitted to trying to steal a loaf of bread thatmorning from a nearby grocery, many of which are owned by immigrantAsians.   ``The Chinaman almost took my head off,'' she said, exhibitingfingernail scratches streaking her neck. ``I know it's wrong, butmy kids have to eat.''   Almost six weeks into the gravest political and economic crisisin Panamanian history, the women, like most others in the camp, aredesperate.   They have virtually no money, have been kicked out of the roomsthey previously rented and see no prospects that things will soonimprove enough to allow them to return to their menial or domesticjobs.   They all cursed Noriega. Told that a newspaper supportive of theregime had dubbed the settlement ``Not One Step Backward'' _Noriega's slogan in his battle with the United States _ they allbut spat their disgust.   The land is owned by the Chanis family, a clan of doctors andstatesmen prominent for several generations. They do not intend tosit by while it is requisitioned by the masses.   ``The seizure took us by surprise,'' said Dr. Rolando Chanis.``We await adequate action by authorities to correct thesituation.''   De Gracia, whose family had been sharing his mother-in-law'stwo-room apartment with seven others, said he organized thetakeover along with four friends with whom he regularly playedvolleyball.   ``In the first days, with just 60 families, we feared a move todislodge us,'' he said. ``But the news circulated fast, and withthe country the way it is, people poured in. It is another thing todisloge 570 families. They'd have to think twice about tryingthat.''   Any move against the squatters on behalf of the landowners wouldcontradict official propaganda. Noriega's regime portrays thecrisis as a confrontation between good, underpriveleged andnationalistic Panamanians and bad, wealthy ``sell-outs'' conspiringwith Washington to subjugate the isthmus.</TEXT></DOC>
