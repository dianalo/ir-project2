 laser printer market.andP;  Reliable industry sources haveestimated that HP has sold almost 2.5 million LaserJEt-family printers sincethey were introduced in 1984.andP;  Given that there may be another 500,000PCL-clone printers installed, and that Adobe claims 600,000 installedPostScript printers, PCL printers evidently account for at least 80 percentof the total desktop laser printer market.andM;Consequently, the introduction last week of HP's long-awaited replacement forthe venerable LaserJet II, the LaserJet III, is rightfully being treated as amajor industry event.andP;  The LaserJet III is HP's first printer to incorporateits much-touted PCL 5 language, with which HP has closed some of the gapbetween PCL's functionality and PostScript's.andP;  And with the optionalLocalTalk port and Adobe PostScript cartridge, the LaserJet III is the idealplatform for someone wanting the best of both worlds.andM;The bottom line: once again HP has produced an aggressively priced,attractive and reliable printer that we expect will meet or exceed itspredecessor's sales performance.andM;A good buy.andP;  As is fitting for a printer designed to replace the best-sellinglaser printer of all time, the LaserJet III at first glance appears to bemore evolutionary than revolutionary.andP;  Priced at $2,395--$200 less than theLaserJet II--the LaserJet III is an attractive buy.andP;  It uses the same 8-ppmCanon SX engine and the same toner cartridge as the LaserJet II.andP;  It has thesame 200-sheet paper cassette, the same front panel controls (albeit withlarger, raised buttons that have a good, solid feel), the same two cartridgeslots in the front of the machine, and the same I/O options built in(including a video port--good news to the LaserMasters, et al.andP;  of theworld).andP;  Its duty cycle is 12,000 pages per month.andM;There are a few obvious differences, however.andP;  The LaserJet III sports I MBof internal memory and can be upgraded to a total of 5 MB by adding two 2-MBmemory cards (identical in form factor to those used in the IIP, although theIIIs use faster memory).andP;  The internal I MB of memory is deemed sufficientfor most normal office functions, although, as with PostScript printers, themore memory you have, the more fonts can be downloaded to it and complexpages printed with it.andM;The printer's eight internal scalable typefaces are CG Times and Univers inlight, bold, italic and bold italic.andP;  It also comes with the same 14 internalbitmap fonts as the IID and IIP printers.andP;  The usual assortment of bitmapsoft and cartridge fonts can be used with the III, including all those usedwith preceding HP LaserJets.andP;  HP merits kudos for preserving customers'existing font investments.andM;On top of these features, HP has added further enhancements, which we feelwill go a long way toward making this printer a winner.andP;  Here are our firstviews of them.andM;PCL 5.andP;  This is HP's first printer to use its enhanced PCL printer language.andO;PCL 5 adds scalable fonts (via Compugraphic's Intellifont font-scalingtechnology); HPGL/2 (HP's standardized plotter language), which givesLaserJet III users vector drawing capabilities with pattern fills, arbitraryrotation of text or graphics, and graphics scaling; new layout features thatenable users to print multiple orientations of text and graphics, such asportrait and landscape, on the same page; and special font and graphicseffects, including reverse, oblique, shadow and mirror printing of fonts.andM;Although some of PCL 5's capabilities are similar to those ofPostScript--particularly fonts scalable from outlines and some of the PHGL/2graphic effects--PCL 5 isn't PostScript, nor does it have all of PostScript'srich graphic drawing capabilities.andP;  HPGL/2 support is something PCL shouldhave had all along.andP;  Had PCL 5 been released three years ago--when the PDLmarket was still in flux--it could have evolved into a real force.andM;PostScript option.andP;  But HPGL/2 is not as sophisticated as PostScript--it is,after all, primarily a vector drawing command language for plotters enhancedwith the ability to do pattern fills and the like.andP;  PCL's promise has longbeen that of offering fast access to fonts and some graphics at a fraction ofthe cost of PostScript.andP;  Today, with the street price of PostScript down toaround $400-500 via add-on cartridges such as PAcific Data Products' PacificPage series for the II and IIP, price is no longer a barrier to someoneneeding PostScript's sophistication (although speed might still be decisiveto some, since our tests show that complex pages rendered by PCL 5 image inless than a minute on average).andM;HP recognizes this paradox, of course, which is why it is offering aconvenient, $695 genuine Adobe PostScript cartridge add-on--one that willalso work in both the IIP and the IID (replacing the existing IID PostScriptcartridge).andP;  The PostScript option on the IIP and III will require anupgrasde to 2-MB of memory (although HP says that in a pinch some pages willimage on the III using the machine's internal I MB of RAM, 720 KB of which isuser accessible), whereas the duplex IID will require an upgrade to 4-MB ofRAM.andP;  The PostScript cartridge is slated for delivery starting April 1 (nojoke).andM;HP has taken a further step toward accommodating PostScript users byannouncing an optional LocalTalk hardware interface for the LaserJet III, IIPand IID, available May 1 at a list price of $275.andP;  The localTalk interfacewill use the optional I/O slot on the III and IID.andP;  (The IIP will require anI/O daughterboard swap, which will be dealer installable.)andM;Indeed, both the III and the IIP, when outfitted with PostScript andLocalTalk, will be competitive with Apple's and QMS's PostScript offerings,throwing in good PC connectivity at no extra cost.andP;  For example, with 2 MB ofmemory (HP's memory upgrades cost $495 per megabyte, but memory can be foundat lower prices from a number of third parties, including Pacific DataProducts), HP's PostScript cartridge and the LocalTalk option, a LaserJet IIIwould list for $3,860--about what you'd pay for a LaserWriter IINT on theopen market.andP;  But nobody pays list price in the LaserJet world.andP;  Assuming atypical discount of 30% off list, the LaserJet III PostScript alternativewould cost about $2,700.andM;A similarly configured LaserJet IIP, which in spite of its 4-ppm rating is animpressive machine with a fast controller capable of pumping out PacificPagePostScript clone files at nearly the engine's rated speed, comes in at adiscounted price of $2,419 ($3,455 list) with 2.5 MB of memory installed!andM;The Mac trade press has already sniffed out this angle from HP'sannouncements and views it as further evidence that Apple has its back to thewall these days.andM;To further enhance the LaserJet line's universality, HP also intends to offeran Epson FX/IBM Proprinter emulation cartridge in the third quarter of thisyear.andP;  Pricing has yet to be determined.andM;Scalable fonts.andP;  One of the strongest selling features of the LaserJet serieshas been its easy-to-use font cartridge selections.andP;  Although a wideselection of downloadables have also been available (from HP, Bitstream andother sources), we have long suspected that most users don't want the hassleof dealing with products like Bitstream's Fontware or HP's TypeDirector--unless they can't get the font they need any other way.andM;With PostScript but a $695 cartridge away, we think most users will eschewthe new release of Type Director (2.0, which adds the ability to downloadfont outlines to the LaserJet III) as well as the growing collection ofdisk-based scalable typefaces (which have been reduced from $195 to $99) infavor of scalable-typeface cartridges, two of which were announced along withthe III.andP;  These cartridges have the same form factor as HP font cartridgesand plug into the printer's font-cartridge slots.andP;  The first twoscalable-typeface cartridge collections, Distinctive Documents I/CompellingPublications I and Brilliant Presentations I/Compelling Publications II, willinclude such faces as CG Palacio, Garamond Antigua and ITC Bookman.andM;Each will list for $399 and be available on June I.andP;  Screen fonts for eachface will be included on disk in each package.andM;AutoFont support.andP;  Speaking of fonts, HP is also making available to theindustry its solution for automatically providing font metrics for softwareapplications.andP;  AutoFont Support works with both outline and bitmap fonts thathave been designed for all HP LaserJet printers (PCL mode only).andP;  By adoptingthe AutoFont Support standard, application developers can eliminate the needto supply their own font metric tables, or to provide their own font-driverupdates.andP;  Moreover, applications that support the standard will give usersimmediate access to new fonts and scalable typeface products as they becomeavailable.andM;AutoFont Support consists of two components: AutoFont Support files shippedwith each font or scalable typeface product, and an AutoFont Support filereader to be incorporated into application software.andP;  Software vendors needto add the code for the AutoFont Support file reader to an application onlyonce.andP;  The AutoFont Support file reader in the software then reads the metricinformation and creates a font table for the application to use.andM;Companies that have publicly committted to offer AutoFont Support includeAgfa Compugraphic, Aldus, Bitstream, The Font Factory, Microsoft, VenturaSoftware and Word-Perfect.andP;  HP expects to begin shipping AutoFont Supportfiles with each HP front cartridge and scalable typeface product in thesecond quarter of this year.andM;Resolution Enhancement featureandM;Given built-in scalable fonts and its optional PostScript and LocalTalksupport, the LAserJet III--at a base price of $2,395--would be an attractivevalue compared to its competition even if all else were equal.andP;  However, HP'sengineers have shown they still know their stuff by creating the LaserJetIIIhs built-in Resolution Enhancement feature.andM;Although similar to the techniques used by Laser/Master and others to squeezehigher apparent resolution out of a 300-dpi Canon SX engine, ResolutionEnhancement is a proprietary HP design implemented in an ASIC on the LaserJetIII's controller board.andP;  The ASIC intercepts data and looks at each dot inrelationship to neighboring dots.andP;  It produces no apparent speed degradationand requires no software support.andP;  (For a more in-depth look at ResolutionEnhancement's apparent benefits, see the accompanying illustrations.)andM;Resolution Enhancement improves edge smoothness and prints sharper lineintersections by adjusting dot size and position in relationship toneighboring dots.andP;  Dot position is adjusted in the horizontal plane bycontrolling the on-off timing of the laser beam.andP;  The resulting edge of anearly vertical line or curve looks smoother because the dot's position hasbeen shifted closer to neighboring dots.andM;Dot size is controlled by varying the intensity of the laser beam.andP;  Itssmoothing effect is created by placing dots that have been divided in 20%increments into corollary relationships.andP;  The 20% dot is placed opposite the80% dot, the 40% dot opposite the 60% dot, and so on, to create a line thatappears uniform in width.andP;  This process is used to smooth lines that arenearly horizontal and to create sharper points and line intersections.andM;Resolution Enhancement will work with HP's add-on PostScript option (andpresumably those from Pacific Data Products and others), but not withhalftones or external control.andP;  The lack of support for the latter is a pity,since one could do marvelous things with external control for images andhalftones, but in theory a product like Intel's Visual Edge could work intandem with Resolution Enhancement to provide the best of both worlds.andM;How good is it?andP;  At the time of publication, we were unable to try out theLaserJet III's more interesting functions with a live application.andP;  Driversfor Windows 3.0 and XyWrite IV, which are the two applications w're mostlikely to use inhouse, are in development or awaiting release.andP;  Consequently,our print samples come from a number of test files provided by HP, butprinted in our office.andM;From the series of print samples presented here, the LaserJet III's&quot;Resolution Enhancement&quot; appears to result in a darkening of the character aswell as a smoothing of the jaggies.andP;  This impression is underscored by HP'snaming convention for the resolution enhancement settings, which offer thechoices of &quot;dark,&quot; &quot;medium,&quot; &quot;light&quot; and &quot;none.&quot;andM;In our efforts to obtain the &quot;perfect&quot; setting, we discovered that we had toadjust the resolution enhancement setting along with the SX engine's tonerdensity setting, which is accomplished by adjusting a wheel inside theprinter's cover (with &quot;1&quot; representing the darkest and &quot;9&quot; the lightestsetting).andP;  We have long felt that the SX has a bias toward its darksettings--ideal for solid blacks but offten resulting in horsy type.andP;  Playingwith the various combinations of toner density and resolution enhancementsettings, we settled on &quot;toner density: 7, Resolution Enhancement: medium&quot; asour preferred settings.andP;  Those settings were used for the main samples fromthe LaserJet III on our page of sample output.andM;Does it really make a difference?andP;  The resolution enhancement feature doesappear to work.andP;  Characters are less jagged and details such as serifs arebetter defined.andP;  Compare the samples with resolution enhancement turned on tothe one with it turned off.andP;  Then compare the enhanced samples with the sametext printed on a LaserJet IIP, using hte Microsoft &quot;Z&quot; font cartridge'sTimes 10.andM;We would rank the samples as follows:andM;1.andP;  LaserJet Series III Resolution Enhancement setting &quot;medium,&quot; tonerdensity setting &quot;7.&quot;andM;2.andP;  Bitmap fonts on the LaserJet IIP.andP;  (We think that the 4-ppm IIP printengine produces slightly better quality than the 8-ppm SX engine used in theregular LaserJets and LaserWriters.andP;  Hand-Tuned bitmap fonts may also havesome advantage at small sizes over scalable fonts.)andM;3.andP;  LaserJet Series III with Resolution Enhancement turned off.andM;4.andP;  LaserJet Series III with Resolution Enhancement set to &quot;heavy&quot; and thetoner density set to &quot;5&quot; (the normal setting).andP;  (This type looks too heavyand lumpy at text sizes.)andM;Print quality that's started a resolutionandM;revolution.andM;HP's new Resolution Enhancement technology eliminates jagged lines and edges,smooths curves, sharpens comers and intersections.andP;  The result is a newstandard in 300 dpi print quality.andP;  Documents look more professional, moreExpress yourself futher MasterType Library and scalable typefacesandM;The power to do whatandM;done before.andM;The PCL 5 printer lan scalable type with HPandM;Comparison with the LaserWriter.andP;  However, when we compared even the mostenhanced LaserJet output with copy produced on a LaserWriter NTX, there wasno contest.andP;  At text sizes for the fonts we compared, we clearly preferredthe LaserWriter output.andM;Why?andP;  Because there is more to type quality than output resolution.andP;  Based onwhat we have seen thus far, we prefer the Adobe PostScript front designs tothe Compugraphic equivalents.andP;  More importnat, we think that the Adobe fontand rasterizing technology is clearly superior to the CG technology HP isusing.andP;  Note, for example, the uneven baseline alignment of the 10-point CGTimes.andP;  Even though the resolution-enhanced LaserJet output may have smoothercurves and better definition, the Adobe font is better aligned, better spacedand has a cleaner appearence.andP;  The Adobe ATM rasterizer (which we expect tosee incorporated into future PostScript printers) will do an even better job.andM;Bottm line.andP;  We wonder what the Resolution Enhancement technology will do toPostScript fonts with the PostScript cartridge installed.andP;  Will it increasethe apparant resolution of the Adobe fonts, making the good better?andP;  Or willit be too much of a good thing, rendering the elegant Adobe typefaces heavierthan normal?andP;  We will have to wait until we get HP's PostScript cartridgeoption for the final verdict.andM;For the moment, it appears to us that resolution enhancement provides realbenefit.andP;  However, the practical effect of this benefit is, we believe,substantially diminished by fonts and font technology that aren't as good asAdobe's and by a default &quot;heavy&quot; setting that means that less-sophisticatedpeople who use the machine as it comes &quot;out of the box&quot; will see text typethat actually looks worse than text type printed without the ResolutionEnhancement feature.andM;Product positioningandM;HP look advantage of the LaserJet III's launch to drp the price of its duplexLaserJet IID printer by $700, from $4,295 to $3,595.andP;  This move smooths theprice curve for the three LaserJet low-end products and enables HP toposition an impressive array of products, ranging from the DeskJet ink-jetprinter on the low end to the LaserJet 2000 departmental printer on the highend (see accompanying comparison chart).andM;It does result in the apparent paradox of having HP's middle-range product,the III, being more technologically advanced than its high-end cousins, theIID and 2000, but HP assures us that there will be a range of add-on andupgrade options--as well as new printers--designed to correct this anomalyover the next 12 to 18 months.andP;  (HP, in a laudable move that should beemulated by other printer manufacturers, even has in the works an upgradeoption for Series II owners, which will list for about $1,100 and beavailable in June.)andP;  One could argue that, given the competitive forces atwork in the PostScript arena, HP is a day late and a dollar short with itsfirst PCL 5 printer.andP;  But HP has gone out of its way to make it possible forusers to add PostScript as well as LocalTalk support.andP;  With the flexibilityto switch-hit between PCL 5 and PostScript, its Resolution Enhancementfeature, its pace-setting pricing and the usual putstanding HP reliabilityand fit and finish built in, the LaserJet III is a good buy whether youintend to use it as a PCL or a PostScript printer.andM;And as HP will quietly point out, the LaserJet III will be a winner eitherway.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
