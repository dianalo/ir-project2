Now, as disclosures grow about the lavish living of formerleader Erich Honecker and his ousted cronies, she feels deeplybetrayed.   ``I always knew there were privileged layers in society,'' saysthe 32-year-old art historian. ``But people just didn't know theextent of what was going on.''   For years, Honecker manipulated the official news media toproclaim a phoenix-like recovery from the ashes of World War II andaccused the West of waiting to plunder East Germany.   But according to recent revelations, Honecker and his friendswere themselves plundering the country. There were fancy huntinglodges, imported foods and clothes, shining Volvos.   So far, the allegations have hit mainly a several dozen topCommunist Party members, and much of the ousted leadership facescriminal prosecution. Seven former Politburo members are in jail,and Honecker is under house arrest.   Wandlitz, the compound where the party bosses lived, is beingturned into a health center for children. The compound includes anindoor swimming pool, perfectly manicured grounds and houses thatare the envy of the rest of the nation's 16.3 million people.   Honecker's summer retreat, complete with two restaurants, isbeing turned into a tourist hotel that can accommodate 50 people.   ``I never knew there were these mafia-like organizations,'' saidMs. Koecher, referring to businesses set up to hide financialirregularities.   The accusations of corruption reached a peak on Dec. 1, when onemember of Parliament suggested the disgraced leaders stashed $54billion in Swiss bank accounts.   While prosecutors have not used that figure, they have said thathundreds of millions of dollars left the country.   The reform movements in other Soviet bloc countries have not ledto anything like East Germany's anti-corruption fervor.   Opposition leader Vaclav Havel said that if he is electedCzechoslovakia's president he will try to prevent a ``witchhunt''against the Communists.   ``There must be justice, but not revenge,'' Havel said.   Polish Prime Minister Taduesz Mazowiecki, a member of theSolidarity opposition, has cut off government subsidies that helpedthe Communist Party build a vast bureaucracy and acquire companies,buildings, hotels, fleets of cars and garages. The government hassaid it has no plans to recover property, however.   The best-known Soviet case involved Yuri Churbanov, son-in-lawof the late Kremlin leader Leonid I. Brezhnev. Churbanov, formerdeputy interior minister, was convicted a year ago of taking bribesand is serving a 12-year prison term.   The current leaders are fanning popular resentment ofcorruption, in part to deflect any criticism of them.   ``The whole thing is being played up,'' says Guenther Buch, aWest German government expert on East German affairs. ``Certainly,people knew about it. But before, people were punished if theystarted talking.''   ``Now they're venting their anger,'' he said.   Buch said he fears the resentment could turn into violence,especially if there are disclosures of corruption in the middle andlower levels of the Communist Party.   In an interview with the Communist newspaper Junge Welt,opposition leader Rainer Eppelmann said he believes there also arecases of corruption in the four parties long allied with theCommunists.   The former head of one of those parties, the ChristianDemocrats, already is under investigation for unspecified financialirregularities.   Part of East Germany's anti-corruption campaign is in the handsof a commission headed by new Communist Party chief Gregor Gysi.   Gysi, a 41-year-old lawyer, has promised to uncover all abusebut has cautioned against ``tearing ourselves to pieces.''   One of the best-known cases of corruption so far is that ofAlexander Schalck-Golodkowski, wanted for overseeing a ring thatsold weapons to countries in South America, Africa and the MiddleEast.   The former top-ranking government official is in a West Berlinprison and says he will fight any extradition attempts.   He has said he was repaying about $30 million to East Germanyfrom Swiss bank accounts, but that is only a small part of what thenation's official news media claim he embezzled.   ``Schalck-Golodkowski is worried he'll be sacrificed if he issent back,'' says his West Berlin lawyer, Peter Danckert.</TEXT></DOC>
