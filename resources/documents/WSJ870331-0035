Extending a deep slump that began Friday, prices of some 30-year Treasury issues plummeted more than two points, or over $20 for each $1,000 face amount. During the past two sessions, yields on these Treasury issues have surged more than a quarter of a percentage point to about 7.84%, the highest level since last October.    Short-term interest rates also climbed. The average rate on new 13-week Treasury bills at yesterday's regular weekly auction rose to 5.72% from 5.55% at last week's auction. The average rate on new 26-week bills increased to 5.80% from 5.55% the previous week.    As the dollar has slumped against the Japanese yen, fear has grown that Japanese investors may sell their U.S. bond holdings and move into other currencies. That worry intensified Friday after the Reagan administration announced plans to impose a tariff on Japanese electronic goods. &quot;What you have here is a falling dollar in the context of what may be a trade war developing, and that is very unsettling,&quot; said Hugo J.H. Schielke, chairman of American andamp; European Investment Corp. in Bethesda, Md.    &quot;It's a particularly ugly market right now,&quot; said David H. Resler, vice president and chief economist of Nomura Securities International Inc. &quot;The escalation of trade problems between the U.S. and Japan poses new doubts about the potential for a continuation of Japanese capital flows into this country.&quot;    But Mr. Resler and many other analysts said there hasn't been any large-scale selling thus far by the Japanese, and that there probably won't be.    &quot;I think the fears are running ahead of reality,&quot; Mr. Resler said. &quot;I think it's premature to conclude that Japanese investors will abandon the U.S. markets. But I think the trade problems have increased the risk that there may be a reduction in Japanese investments here.&quot;    &quot;There has been a little selling in Japan but not that much,&quot; said Scott Pardee, vice chairman of Yamaichi International (America) Inc. &quot;Japanese investors are very seriously worried about the dollar, but so far it's more an absence of buying than it is aggressive selling by foreign investors.&quot;    Still, the dollar's plight is having a &quot;chilling impact&quot; on the bond markets, Mr. Pardee continued. &quot;We need continued heavy inflows of money from abroad to avoid a sharp rise in interest rates,&quot; Mr. Pardee said.    Moreover, the dollar's steep slide has aroused renewed concern that inflation will increase as imports become more expensive. As a result, the Federal Reserve System can't afford to ease credit conditions, many economists say. If the dollar continues to crumble, the Fed might even nudge interest rates higher, some analysts say.    &quot;People are afraid the Fed will have to tighten (credit conditions) to defend the dollar,&quot; said Mr. Pardee. Mr. Schielke echoed this view. &quot;The Fed can't just stand by and allow the dollar to keep collapsing,&quot; he said. &quot;Therefore, you have to build in the possibility that the Fed might allow the federal funds rate to drift slightly higher.&quot;    The federal funds rate averaged 6.33% yesterday, according to Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc. It averaged 6.15% last Friday. The funds rate, which is the rate on overnight loans of reserves between banks, is watched especially closely by analysts because the Fed has more control over it than any other rate. The funds rate strongly influences many other rates, including those that bond dealers pay to finance their bond holdings.    Federal Reserve officials won't comment on their credit policy plans. However, Fed Chairman Paul Volcker previously has said he wouldn't rule out the possibility of a credit-tightening move to bolster the dollar. The Fed's policy-making arm, known as the Federal Open Market Committee, is scheduled to meet today to review its credit strategy.    An index of long-term Treasury bonds compiled by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. dropped 25.54 points, the largest drop since Sept. 11, to close at 1384.04. That was the lowest closing level since Nov. 10, when the index fell to 1375.32, said Peter Campbell of Shearson. The index yesterday wound up near its lowest level of the day, which was 1380.65. The high was 1397.04.    The Treasury's 7 1/2% bonds due 2016 fell to 96 3/32 from 98 6/32 Friday and from 99 3/8 Thursday. The yield rose to 7.84% from 7.65% Friday and 7.55% Thursday. The government's 7 1/4% notes due 1996 fell to 98 1/32 yesterday from 99 10/32 Friday, as the yield increased to 7.54% from 7.35%.    In the municipal bond market, underwriters led by Salomon Brothers Inc. tentatively priced a proposed offering of revenue bonds by the New Jersey Building Authority. The issue is expected to total around $103.8 million. Yields range from 6 3/4% on bonds due 2002 to 7 1/8% on bonds due 2013.    A $1.6 billion bond issue for Puerto Rico's Government Development Bank is expected to be priced today. First Boston Corp. heads the underwriting group.    Here are details of the government's auction of short-term Treasury bills yesterday:    Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.                                  13-Week            26-Week Applications .......... $24,916,505,000     $28,015,600,000 Accepted bids .......... $6,402,275,000      $6,424,905,000 Accepted at low price ............. 14%                 62% Accepted noncompet'ly .. $1,031,465,000        $780,300,000 Average price (Rate) ... 98.554 (5.72%)      97.068 (5.80%) High price (Rate) ...... 98.559 (5.70%)      97.068 (5.80%) Low price (Rate) ....... 98.549 (5.74%)      97.068 (5.80%) Coupon equivalent ............... 5.90%               6.07%   Both issues are dated April 2.
