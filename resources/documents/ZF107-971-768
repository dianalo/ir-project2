(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>ACD SOFTWARE MAKERSandM;All affinitec ACD software products help inbound call centers measureresults, manage performance and achieve objectives.andP;  Together, theyconstitute one of the most comprehensive product lines and perhaps the mostfully integrated ACD/MIS solution in the business.andP;  Each of them, however, iswholly effective standing on its lonesome.andM;A unique Feedback Loop enables managers to monitor their center's performanceand improve operations.andP;  Ease of implementation, training and use alsocontribute to the quick payback you get on these systems.andM;All affinitec offerings are adaptable, flexible and brawny.andP;  As such, theycan serve the unique requirements of a broad range of environments.andP;  Amammoth customer base and a wealth of real world experience -- and acommitment to refine and expand customer benefits -- are just a few of theperipheral perks you get with these systems.andM;Now that we've described Affinitec's products jointly, let's look at themseparately.andP;  A Forecaster package allows you to track and isolate trends incustomer calling behavior based on day of the week and time of day.andP;  You canalso trace fluctuations given such variables as season of the year, specialevents and promotions, billing cycles and market traditions.andM;The Affinitec Scheduler harnesses artificial intelligence technology toautomate scheduling chores, maximizing staff usage while minimizing theinevitable managerial migraines and priority judggling that come with theterritory.andM;The Scheduler considers such variable scheduling constrains as management andoperational rules, employee availability, seniority and wage rates,individual preferences for shift start time, shift end time and lunch timesand requirements for break placement and day-off assignment.andM;By clearly delineating the symbiosis between forecasted requirements andscheduled agents, the Scheduler helps management realistically plan overalloperations for maximum efficiency.andM;An In-charge package allows you to cope with unexpected developments.andP;  Itspowerful reporting capabilities alert you to any startling new forecastrequirements before it's too late to make scheduling adjustments.andO;Simultaneously, In-Charge shows you which agents are available for dutyduring traffic peaks and those who can assume administrative tasks duringtraffic valleys.andM;Managers wishing to have a reliable method of tracking tardy and absencepatterns in the office should consider Affinitec's Attendance software.andP;  Thispackage's historical database of tardy and absent underlings makesperformance evaluations and disciplines programs more equitable.andP;  You caneven define ratings and alarms when an individual or group has not adhered toyour company's unique attendance standards.andM;Affinitec's Analyzer program is a robust, PC-based solution to historicalreporting, data analysis, management reporting and performance evaluationneeds.andP;  The Measurement system collects, stores and reports actualperformance results.andM;Cybernetics SystemsandM;EMPS (Employee Management and Planning Systems)andM;Compatible with: All major ACD manufacturers.andM;Real-time statistics?: yes.andM;Color grahpics?: yes.andM;Major types of reports: Forecasting, manpower coverage, work schedules,consolidated network coverage, intraday forecasting, workload requirements,employee information.andM;Suggested Retail Price: $25,000 and up.andM;Cybernetic's Employee Management and Planning System (EMPS) is asophisticated ACD package for two major objectives -- employee resourceallocation and administration.andM;A flexible design makes this software amenable to different managementtechniques within a single company and across disparate industries.andP;  Over 100man-years have been put into the development of EMPS -- and it shows.andM;EMPS is made up of several interactive programs which automate the process ofplannint and controlling a workforce.andP;  We discuss them briefly below.andM;The Data Gathering Interface module receives and retains traffic andtransaction data from your ACD or other data gathering device.andP;  Itautomatically updates other system components as needed, and stores employeeand function data to be summoned on demand.andM;A Work History and Forecasting module permits storage and retrieval ofworkload info for each function.andP;  You can stow away your data in half-hour ordaily increments for up to 99 functions per history file.andP;  The forecastingarm can predict workloads for daily, weekly or monthly clips.andP;  Dailyforecasts can be calibrated in increments as tiny as five minutes.andM;The Requirements component ascertains the number of staff people needed tohandle a given workload by time of day.andP;  Employing work history statistics,it fashions a model for the inbound rush of callers and the time required toservice each one.andP;  It then determines the personnel levels required for allperiods of the day.andM;A robust Scheduling module developes the patterns of days off and starttimes, in addition to that subtle mix of shift types required to mosteffectively amass your call center troops.andP;  If necessary, it can allocatethese shifts to different work areas.andM;Other tasty EMPS components include:andM;* an Administration module, which creates and maintains a database on workhours, employees and assignments, and evaluates the status of your workforceagainst the workload;andM;* Shift Assignment, which relegates employees to a pre-determined set ofrequired shifts based on seniority and preference;andM;* Trunking, which pinpoints the grade of service of trunk groups and thenumber of trunks required to fulfill a targeted grade of service;andM;* and Network Management, which furnishes intended ones with all they'll needto access remote auxiliary processors -- the better to gather and consolidatemultiple site information.andM;Since we last examined the EMPS, it has acquired a new user interface.andP;  Forwhich we offer our sincerest congratulations.andM;HTL TelemanagementandM;NTD-7 ACD DesignerandM;Compatible with: All major ACD manufacturers.andM;Real-time statistics?: no, but works with real-time stats.andM;Color graphics?: no.andM;Major types of reports: Single-period analysis, multi-period analysis basedon current optimizations and minimum cost, grade of service, reports bynumbers of agents or by number of agents and lines.andM;Suggested Retail Price: $2,500.andM;HTL Telemanagement's NTD-7 ACD Designer is a standalone module which takesACD statistics and subjects them to detailed &quot;what if&quot; analyses.andP;  Using thisinformation, call center chieftains can make informed decisions on whether toadd groups and agents.andP;  They can also calculate the service level which ismost conducive to their particular ACD application.andM;The ACD Designer gleans raw material from ACD summary reports -- like theaverage conversation times, work duration and the number of calls per halfhour.andP;  All of this data is entered into the system's database.andP;  When makingits calculations, the ACD DEsigner takes note of both particular grades ofservice and the number of trunks being used.andM;Feed the ACD Designer a desired service level, and it will estimate thenumber of trunks and the number of additional agents you'd need to reach it.andO;The module can also predict how many customers would be kept on hold, howmany would abandon their calls and how your class of service would beaffected should your inbound traffic increase by a given percentage.andM;The ACD Designer is geared especially for switches with a single gate --requiring in-WATS, alternative service and a usage-sensitive FX.andP;  The systemcan calculate an optimal configuration for these ACDs, basing its findingsnot only upon cost but also upon the work and the talk time of your agents.andM;Although the ACD Designer can accommodate a single gate with up to eighttrunk groups, it can also be employed in multigate applications.andP;  It canstomach a grand total of 500 agents and 800 trunks.andM;MTC SystemsandM;ACD Time ManagerandM;Compatible with: SL-1 (all releases); Rolm 8000, 9000, 9751 (9004, 9005).andM;Real-time statistics?: yes.andM;Color graphics?: yes.andM;Major types of reports: Customer service analysis, forecasting, scheduling,agent performance, graphic analysis.andM;Suggested Retail Price: $9,500 to $30,000.andM;Any intelligent discussion of MTC Systems' ACD Time Manager would have to beprefaced by an exposition of three primordial points:andM;1.andP;  The Time Manager gives you virtually unlimited flexibility whenfashioning your agent scheduling and agent performance reports.andM;2.andP;  The system proffers applications from the very small company all the wayup to the corporate behemoth, without making sacrifices on either end.andM;3.andP;  It can make available up to 128 supervisor CRT positions with access toall reports -- historical, real-time and scheduling.andM;Having stated the essential, let us move on to specific.andP;  The Time Managerhas a sterling Agent Performance feature, keeping dibs on a practicallyunlimited number of individual agents over the last two years.andP;  You getperformance records on certain days of the week and time of day, andcomparisons against company standards or other agents.andP;  Exception reports arealso a mere simple menu selection away.andM;Another component on the Time Manager gives you profiles in customer serviceincluding offered, answered and abandoned calls or distributions.andP;  Theprofiles are available on the half-hour for a full two years in theirentirety.andP;  There's none of the past summarizations you get with some othersystems.andP;  And all the vital data can be served up to you on attractive screengraphics.andM;The Time Manager's trunking prowess spans from all trunk busy to no trunktraffic reports right on down to every call bounding in on a single trunk.andO;It can even recoup some of the lost trunk reports you experienced when yourecently made that move to T-1 service.andM;A rugged forecasting feature tells you what the future holds in store forservice, agent requirements, trunk requirements and staff levels.andP;  Theforecaster employs the industry-standard Erlang C queuing theory andtop-of-the-line proprietary MTC algorithms to get the job done quickly andefficiently.andM;A scheduling feature matches agent and customer time preferences against eachother, ang generates schedules to meet availability, labor agreements andservice level specs.andM;Other powerful parts of the Time Manager whole include a stroke count, tokeep tallies on why each customer is calling, and what if scenarios, whichlet you know how certain changes would probably affect your operations.andM;Fresh on the 1989 ACD Time Manager slate are real-time exception reportingand an interface to industry-standard software, such as Lotus.andP;  A multi-siteoverflow control with &quot;look ahead&quot; capabilities has also been added for usewith integrated ACDs, such as the Rolm 9751.andM;Nova SystemandM;ACD ReporterandM;Compatible with: Rolm 8000, 9000, 9751; Northern Telecom SL-1.andM;Real-time statistics?: yes.andM;Color graphics?: yes.andM;Major types of reports: System summary, agent, group, answered call, trunk,forecast, schedules, management.andM;Suggested Retail Price: $9,800 -- $27,800, plus optionsandM;Nova's ACD Reporter is an ACD package with sinewy scheduling and forecastingcapabilities.andP;  The system can also create beautiful color graphics, a featurewhich was recently made standard.andM;The Reporter's forecasting reports take into consideration four variables:andM;* calls received by half-hour period for a user-designated historical period;andM;* average talk time of agents per call;andM;* average work time of agents;andM;* and service level.andM;The forecasting arm also allows you to create &quot;what if&quot; scenarios.andP;  To yourheart's content, you can change any of the above variable except thehistorical call average and see what happens.andP;  You can determine thepercentage of calls which should be answered within a set number of secondsafter they are received, as well as the average talk and work times per call.andM;Employing the Erlang C model algorithm the forecaster can calculate theaverage calls answered and the number of agents likely to be needed per halfhour of the day.andM;Nova's scheduling component automatically assigns your agents their shiftsagainst staffing needs, calculated from the system's historical call data.andO;Supervisors can pick and choose how this historical data will be entered intothe scheduling process.andP;  An easy-to-use menu-driven format with on-screenhelp guides them through all of these ministrations.andM;The system can furnish several reports to provide info on system-generatedschedules, allowing you to choose only those reports which will work best foryour sector.andP;  All schedules can be updated for changes.andP;  Thus, if an agentcomes down with a case of laryngitis and calls in sick, you can enter thisdevelopment -- and perhaps compensate for it -- on your revised schedule.andM;The scheduler's calendar includes organization-wide holidays as well asindividual vacations, personal days and even half-day meetings or anafternoon off.andP;  The calendar can be set for many, many years ahead.andM;The reporter's standard graphics feature gives you a firm visual grasp of keyrelationships in call and trunk data.andP;  All graphs are created from within thebasic reporter menu.andP;  And you can view them on screen as well as in printedcopies.andM;Fifteen graphs come standard, while others can be customized to suit yourquirky call-center needs.andP;  System summary reports, trunk usage, answered callprofiles, management summaries and answered call projections can all beserved up in graphic terms.andM;What's new on the ACD Reporter's 1989 beat?andP;  Try automatic batch processingof up to 200 different reports.andP;  Or real-time states to show individual workstate in color codes.andM;PaceCom TechnologiesandM;VISTA-100andM;Compatible with: IBM/Rolm 8000, 9000.andM;Real-time statistics?: yes.andM;Color graphics?: yes.andM;Major types of reports: Automatically calculates performance reports,providing the average number of agents in each call state, the currentservice level, oldest, call and calls in queue for each 15 minute period.andM;Suggested Retail Price: $6,730.andM;PaceCom's Vista-100 is an enhanced supervisor's terminal and message centertailored for the IBM/Rolm 8000 and 9000 switches.andP;  The message componentfurnishes supervisors and agents with constant visual feedback on customerperformance levels.andP;  Agents can find out &quot;how they're doing,&quot; while callcenter commanders can determine whether the whole operation is runningsmoothly ...andP;  or not.andM;The Vista-100's unique message center automatically updates display unitswith the latest scoop on the number of agents active in each state, thelength of the longest held call and the current service level.andP;  You canharness up to 32 of these display units to a single system.andM;Supervisors will simply salivate over the system's special messagingcapability, which permits them to schedule and send as many as 20 specialdispatches to the display units.andP;  Each of these messages can be formatted torepeat every one to 240 minutes.andM;Armed with the special messaging feature, supervisors can relay criticalinformation to the underlings quickly, as well as give them a paternalelectronic pat on the back for a job well done.andM;While we're on the subject of supervisory artillery, let's outline just a fewthe Vista-100's many enhancements to the supervisor's terminal.andP;  There's areal-time color status display, showing up to 80 positions on a singledisplay page without scrolling the screen.andM;There's identification of each agent by name, as well as an indication of thecurrent number of agents in each status.andP;  There's also a powerful historicaldatabase on hand to apprise you of average staff levels for each 15 minuteperiod, and multiple color display monitors to show you real-time activity inseveral rich and subtle hues.andM;In the limited space available, we'll also briefly mention:andM;* graphic displays showing automatic calculation of performance reports forthe ACD group at five minute intervals for the last 10 days;andM;* what if analysis to determine trunk and agent needs;andM;* and alarms set for out-of-bounds conditions.andM;The Vista-100 can be used on the IBM PC-XT, PS/2 or compatible computers.andO;Installation is a snap, requiring no special hardware or large body oftechnical expertise.andM;Perimeter TechnologyandM;RT-100andM;Compatible with: DMS-100 Central Office ACD.andM;Real-time statistics?: yes.andM;Color graphics?: yes.andM;Major types of reports: 18 standard management reports with data by agent,group, directory number, and more.andM;Suggested Retail Price: $19,500.andM;Perimeter's RT-100 is a comprehensive ACD software package crafted for thecentral office.andP;  New York Telephone has employed its good graces on theirNorthern Telecom Meridian DMS-100 switch, to provide real-time managementreporting to their ACD customers.andM;In a testdrive appearing in the May '89 issue of INBOUND/OUTBOUND Magazine,Andrew &quot;Hurry Up And&quot; Waite commented, &quot;I have sold, built and used ACD MISsystems.andP;  This is the easiest system I have ever seen.andP;  It's clear andgraphic, with simple 'point and shoot' menus.&quot;andP;  To paraphrase the voiceoveron the old Arnold Rye commercials -- &quot;from an ACD MIS salesman/builder/user,that's a rave.&quot;andM;The RT-100 gives the manager a bead on virtually every activity taking placeat his call center.andP;  The system's up-to-the-second real-time display lets himknow at a glance:andM;* how many calls are coming in;andM;* how fast they are being answered;andM;* how many callers are being kept on hold;andM;* how long they are being held;andM;* and more.andM;The above information gives the manager the ability to correct system andstaff inefficiencies, while avoiding the malaise caused by lost calls, lostrevenues and irate customers.andP;  The manager can even review queues and agentstatus simultaneously.andM;A hefty historical reporting feature lets you identify trends.andP;  It helps youmeasure the performance of your agents and equipment.andP;  You can get an idea ofhow well your staff is coping, both during lag times and at thoseall-too-dire moments when the proverbial poop flies headlong against the fan.andM;The RT-100 system attaches to the DMS-100 over a real-time data link.andP;  Allactivity is gathered and stored in the system for immediate color graphicdisplay and processed later for printed analyses.andP;  It runs on a customconfigured micro computer under the SCO XENIX operating system.andP;  Multipleterminals can be harnessed to the whole shebang to accommodate multiplemanagers.andM;You can arm your RT-100 with audible and visual parameter alarms, alertingyou whenever preset performance levels are not being met.andP;  A modem-basedremote maintenance feature allows the technical support staff to dial intothe system to perform software updates, provide user support and otheractivities.andP;  An optional Manpower Planning System can fortify the RT-100 withforecasting, scheduling and tracking modules.andM;1989 has not been an idle year for the research team at Perimeter.andP;  They havecome up with an RT-100 report writer and expanded menu-driven load managementfunctions.andP;  They have also integrated the system with an optional ForceManagement system.andM;Professional ResourceandM;ManagementandM;Agent Power IIandM;Compatible with: Rolm 9751, 9000, 8000;

 As a result, youcontrol your software, instead of the software controlling your business.andO;The commitment to flexibility is equally evidence in the company'swillingness to customize changes for specific customers' needs.andM;In addition to flexibility, Agent Power II flaunts an extremely compellingperformance-to-cost ratio when measured against other vendors' agentscheduling software packages.andP;  The system sets up schedules -- withinrealistic personnel parameters sanctioned by the user -- to provide coveragefor projected inbound traffic each half hour over the entire seven days of aweek.andM;Daily lists are furnished of every agent scheduled to work, including lunchand rest stops.andP;  The coverage of these scheduled agents is then summarized bythe half hour, and assessed against the anticipated onslaught of calls.andP;  Youare thus advised in advance of any upcoming shortages or surpluses.andM;Agent Power II's no-nonsense forecasting feature allows you to figure out howmany agents you'll need for next month, or on a potentially crazy time likeDecember.andP;  You can even do the whole year at once (by months), the better toorganize your annual budget with.andM;Automated reports and color graphs of key operating parameters allow you tomonitor your operational health in key areas.andP;  Reports show yesterday, monthto date and year to date.andP;  You can even roll in data from remote locations.andM;Rolm owners will surely be gratified by Agent Power II's on-line displayfeature.andP;  The display adds perspective to Rolm reports by summarizingcustomer service from the beginning of the day until the moment you getcurious.andP;  The color display also lets you know what your agents are doing,and alerts supervisors to any harried agents who may have been on &quot;Work&quot; toolong.andM;Three innovations of note were added to the Agent Power II for 1989.andP;  Thesystem took on automated awarding of agent handling bids, and a faster updateof real-time statistics.andP;  Better handling of exception shifts for agents withirregular schedules -- like college students -- has also entered into thepleasant Agent Power II landscape.andM;Scientific DevelopmentandM;TechnologiesandM;ACD Performance AnalysisandM;Compatible with: Northern Telecom SL-1, Rolm 8000/9000/9751, GTE Omni.andM;Real-time statistics?: yes.andM;Color graphics?: yes -- for some modules only.andM;Major types of reports: 30-second, real-time forecasting, daily and monthlyforecasting, 30-minute, shift, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearlyACD statistics reports, grade of service, economic analysis.andM;Suggested Retail Price: $3,995 -- $9,995.andM;Scientific Development Technologies' Telephone Management System is acomprehensive PC-based solution for call management.andP;
