Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang on Saturday urged the studentsnot to disrupt the visit of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, whoarrives Monday for the first Sino-Soviet summit in 30 years. Theofficial Beijing Daily announced the central square will be clearedof all pedestrians and traffic on Monday.   Zhao also told a workers' group Saturday in the Great Hall ofthe People, adjoining the square, that the government is seriouslyconsidering ways to promote democracy and end official corruption.Both are student demands.   About 3,500 students from more than a dozen universities, allwearing white headbands to signify participation in the fast,converged on the square Saturday afternoon and evening. However, bySunday morning there were only about 1,800 who appeared to beparticipating. They were encircled by about 1,000 other non-fastingstudents.   Police made no attempt to interfere with the protest.   But the Beijing Daily said the square will be closed topedestrians from 8:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. Monday (7:30 p.m. EDTSunday to 7:30 a.m. EDT Monday) and on Tuesday from 8 a.m. to noon.   Zhao told the workers Saturday that democratic changes andcorruption will be discussed next month when the Standing Committeeof China's legislature meets.   ``Every patriotic Chinese citizen should safeguard the dignityof the motherland and its international image,'' the officialXinhua News Agency paraphrased Zhao as saying. ``Nobody should doanything to impede or jeopardize the summit.''   Zhao's remarks followed a meeting of the ruling Politburo lastweek that endorsed his moderate line toward student demands,according to Sunday editions of The New York Times.   The newspaper, quoting three unidentified Chinese familiar withthe proceedings, said the result of the meeting held Wednesday andThursday was to bolster Zhao's faction and its calls for economicand political reform.   Leading activist Wang Dan of Beijing University said fastingstudents may still be in the square when the Soviet leader arrivesMonday for the first Chinese-Soviet summit in 30 years. ``As forwhether we will disrupt Mr. Gorbachev's visit to China, thatdepends on the government,'' he said.   ``We will persist to the end,'' said fasting graduate studentsfrom Qinghua University. ``This is a last resort.''   Early Sunday, hundreds of students and workers began flocking tothe square with banners and posters to express support for the fast.   Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong arrived at the square shortly before 3a.m. Sunday but was shouted down when he tried to address thecrowd. Chen was accompanied by State Education Committee MinisterLi Tieying and they left 15 minutes later.   About 30 students met earlier with Yan Mingfu, head of theCommunist Party's United Front Work Department. He was thehighest-ranking party official to confer with the demonstrators.Two student leaders reported that he told them that some partymembers want to use the turmoil as a reason to stop reforms.   The hunger strikers, wearing white headbands and sashes, satinside a protective cordon of several thousand non-fasting studentsin the vast square that is the symbolic center of power in China.   As temperatures dropped after sunset Saturday to below 50degrees, many pulled on jackets or covered themselves withblankets, while others wrapped themselves in their red and whitebanners.   Shortly before midnight, four trucks and two buses of policepulled up to the square and security forces stood watching. Theydid not intervene.   The fast began Saturday evening after the students marchedseveral hours from their campuses to the square. It is the latestin a month-old student campaign for a free press, human rights, anend to official corruption and other reforms.   After repeated student marches, sit-ins and a class boycott, thegovernment made a major concession Friday by offering to meetMonday with an independent student group.   However, students said they were still discussing with officialsthe terms of a possible dialogue. They were dissatisfied withgovernment conditions that include a limit on the number of studentdelegates and insistence that students from state-sponsoredorganizations also attend. Students also said they wanted the talksto be broadcast live.   If talks are held, the students want the government to guaranteenot to punish students who have protested; to observeconstitutional guarantees of free speech; and to reinstate aliberal newspaper editor fired for resisting censorship.   China announced a one-day delay in the arrival of U.S. warshipsin Shanghai so the event does not coincide with Gorbachev's plannedvisit to the port city. The Foreign Ministry said Saturday theships will make the port call May 19, the day after Gorbachev'svisit.   The announcement appeared to defuse a major source of diplomaticfriction between the Soviets and the Chinese.</TEXT></DOC>
