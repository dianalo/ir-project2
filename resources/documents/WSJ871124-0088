The ruckus surrounding Florida's controversial new tax on a wide range of services is causing other states to rein in plans for generating big tax bucks from the relatively untaxed service sector. Tax experts, however, think the idea will probably pop up elsewhere around the country, once the fight in Florida subsides.    &quot;It isn't breathing here,&quot; says James Klauser, Wisconsin's secretary of administration. A few Wisconsin legislators, with an eye to Florida's tax experiment, have proposed easing the local property tax burden by extending the state's 5% sales tax to cover the fees of lawyers, accountants, barbers, funeral directors and other service providers.    Mr. Klauser argues, in part, that the service-tax approach penalizes small businesses that don't have legal and accounting departments of their own. &quot;It's very adverse to what we're trying to do,&quot; he says. &quot;The governor won't support it.&quot;    The service-tax strategies being debated in Wisconsin and a handful of other states are relatively simple compared to the complex, and contentious, service tax passed by Florida's legislature nearly five months ago. The tax, once championed but now opposed by Gov. Bob Martinez, has been vilified inside and outside the state. Its future is wrapped in a web of political infighting.    Florida's tax has gained national fame courtesy of broadcasters, publishers and big corporate advertisers who are livid over the extension of the service tax to advertising. The widely publicized complaints of these corporate critics have colored the service-tax debate in other states.    MAINE'S ECONOMY is unusually healthy, but the service tax concept was floated there as a way of raising new money for schools while cutting property-tax bills. A proposed tax on dry cleaning, ski-lift tickets and a host of other services and professional fees stood to raise an estimated $80 million a year, about 20% of what the state sales tax brings in now. An ad tax wasn't part of the package, but the idea still fell with a thud, says Richard Silkman, director of Maine's planning office.    &quot;Florida is on people's minds,&quot; Mr. Silkman says. He calls the service tax there &quot;a political disaster.&quot;    Colorado's economy, by contrast, is in sad shape. Legislators have proposed expanding the state lottery to include a lotto game, a proven money-raiser in other states. Gov. Roy Romer, who's opposed to lotteries on principle, suggests a service tax as an alternative means of replenishing the state treasury.    &quot;It's only a possibility,&quot; stresses Cindy Parmenter, the governor's press secretary. &quot;We're aware of the problems in other states. We're looking at it gingerly.&quot;    Do these frosty comments signal the demise of the service tax as a budget-balancing tool? &quot;It's quiet right now, but I don't think the idea is dead at all,&quot; says Karen Benker, research director of the National Association of State Budget Officers.    States seem to have taken two lessons to heart, she says. &quot;Be careful how you tax advertising. When you tax the media, they can beat you over the head.&quot; Also, it's easier to tax barbers than lawyers. &quot;Taxing professional services is difficult,&quot; Ms. Benker says. &quot;Opposition from lawyers, engineers, consultants, veterinarians and accountants is so strong.&quot;    &quot;The concept is very much alive,&quot; adds Constance Heckman, executive director of the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative, business-backed group based in Washington that hollers when talk of levying a service tax crops up in a new locale. She notes that Minnesota and Texas imposed taxes this year on a variety of consumer services with only token opposition.    &quot;What we think is dead or dormant is apportioning taxes across state lines,&quot; Ms. Heckman says. &quot;It was manufacturers and their allies in the advertising industry that got the flames started down in Florida. States are saying, 'We don't need to get in that pot right now.'&quot;    ---   COUNTING OUT-OF-STATE CARS that register in a new state gives a rough idea how fast the state is attracting, or losing, population. In 1982, at the height of Texas's oil boom, owners of 569,000 vehicles swapped their old tags for Texas plates. The number has been falling since then and last year stood at 431,000. The highway department says the 1986 newly registered cars from outside Texas would still fill 17 Houston Astrodome parking lots.    ---   COULD WE HAVE your second choice? The Louisville, Ky., ad agency that created Kentucky's economic development advertising campaign polled 165 executives to learn how Kentucky and its neighboring states rate as ideal office and manufacturing locations. North Carolina won five of the seven site selection categories.    ---   THE INDUSTRIAL STRATEGIES of Massachusetts, Michigan and Pennsylvania are dissected at length in a new report published by the Economic Policy Institute, Washington, D.C. Economic development efforts of other states get briefer treatment.    ---   EXCUSE ME: A scholarly paper delivered yesterday to the Southern Economic Association's annual meeting is titled: &quot;What Do Regional Dummies Measure Anyway?&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
