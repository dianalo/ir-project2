Rep. Henry Gonzalez's plan was the opening salvo of adebate over the federal deposit insurance system for banksand thrifts. The debate is expected to reach its zenith earlynext year, when the Treasury Department is to makerecommendations of its own. The costs to taxpayers -- atleast $150 billion -- from bailing out the broke Sandamp;Linsurance fund has spurred policy makers to look for changes.Mr. Gonzalez said he was offering his plan, with manyprovisions still unsettled, to get the debate under way.</LP><TEXT>   Separately, the nation's top thrift regulator warned thatthe tougher Sandamp;L accounting rules contained in last year'sthrift-cleanup law still may be insufficient.   In a suggestion that will probably give the bankingindustry fits, Mr. Gonzalez called for giving the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp. freedom to increase as much asnecessary the premiums that banks pay for insurance coverage.The Texas Democrat worries that the bank insurance fund is ina weak condition after handling the record number of bankfailures in the past few years.   Mr. Gonzalez also recommended assessing premiums ondeposits held in foreign branches of U.S. banks, an idea thatsplits the banking industry between its big banks, which holdthe foreign deposits and don't want to pay the premiums, andsmall banks all over the country, which don't have foreigndeposits. Though foreign deposits aren't protected by law,the small banks argue that regulators usually cover them inbailouts.   And to help lessen losses to the insurance fund when abank or thrift is bailed out, Rep. Gonzalez proposed thatregulators take over institutions before they reachinsolvency -- when assets are less than liabilities -- andstill have a small amount of net worth. That idea is popularwith regulators but makes the banking industry nervous.   But the suggestion that may get the most notice from thegeneral public was Mr. Gonzalez's proposal to limit multipleinsured accounts. He said it &quot;might be reasonable&quot; to givedepositors insurance on a maximum of three accounts: &quot;apersonal account, a separate business account, and a separatecustodial account like an {individual retirement account}.&quot;Currently, an individual can have an almost unlimited numberof insured accounts by placing deposits in different banks orthrifts.   Mr. Gonzalez also said he &quot;would consider actuallyreducing the $100,000 deposit coverage,&quot; noting that theaverage account is about $8,700. The banking industrygenerally is united in its opposition to lowering the amount,fearing that it would prompt depositors to withdraw funds.Mr. Gonzalez said depositors could pay extra for coverageabove the limits.   Perhaps more significantly, Mr. Gonzalez said he was upsetthat regulators had ignored the $100,000 limit in most bankfailures and covered even deposits that exceeded the limit.Regulators have usually covered all deposits at big banksbecause of the feared effects on the financial system if thedepositors were cut off at $100,000. They have covered alldeposits in most small banks and thrifts as well.   Most experts believe this &quot;too big to fail&quot; policy has tobe tamed before such changes as lowering the depositinsurance limit will have any effect. Mr. Gonzalez said theinsurance limits should be enforced, even for bigpension-fund deposits that have thousands of beneficiaries.If the regulators adopted these suggestions, it would be aradical change in the way bank failures have been handled inrecent decades.   The American Bankers Association, an industry trade group,didn't have any immediate comment on the proposal, but thegroup has called for maintaining the $100,000 limit andimposing a loss of about 10% on deposits above the limit. Theplan, the association says, would ensure that the insurancefund didn't lose money.   Meanwhile, Timothy Ryan, director of the Office of ThriftSupervision, said that generally accepted accountingprinciples, or GAAP, sometimes gloss over the poor health ofsome Sandamp;Ls.   &quot;It is in both our interests to move existing accountingprinciples toward economic reality as quickly as possible,&quot;Mr. Ryan told the American Institute of Certified PublicAccountants.   Unless GAAP rules change to better reflect reality, hesaid, &quot;GAAP will become increasingly irrelevant as aregulatory tool.&quot;   The debate over how to apply accounting rules and whetherthey should be revised is expected to continue. Justyesterday, a federal court ruled in favor of owners ofFranklin Savings Association, Ottawa, Kan., who werecontesting a government takeover earlier this year. Thedispute centered on how the government accounted forFranklin's losses.   Sandamp;L accounting rules were the subject of intense debate ayear ago, as Congress drafted the Sandamp;L cleanup law. Throughoutthe 1980s, government Sandamp;L regulators allowed sickinstitutions to operate under more lenient &quot;regulatoryaccounting principles,&quot; which permitted thrifts to delayaccounting for losses. Meanwhile, liabilities, backed by thetaxpayer, grew to hundreds of billions of dollars.   Also yesterday, two of Neil Bush's business associates,who defaulted on $130 million in loans from SilveradoBanking, Savings andamp; Loan Association, refused to appear beforea congressional panel this week. Rep. Frank Annunzio (D.,Ill.), chairman of a House subcommittee, said he would seeksubpoenas to compel Denver businessmen Bill Walters andKenneth Good to testify about defaulting on the loans whileowning several homes and contributing to the RepublicanNational Committee.   Neil Bush, the son of the president, was a board member ofDenver-based Silverado for three years.   ---   Paulette Thomas contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
