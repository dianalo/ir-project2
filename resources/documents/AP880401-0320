The St. Louis-based food marketer chose six children's cerealswith names like Freakies, Fruit Islands and Ghostbusters for thepromotion.   Ralston isn't the first to recognize the potential in marketingchildren's cereals to adults.   The leader in the $5 billion ready-to-eat cereal market, KelloggCo., has been doing it for years in advertising its Frosted Flakesand Frosted Mini-Wheats brands, among others. Frosted Flakescommercials have shown adults ``confessing'' to a powerfulattraction for the taste of the cereal and drawing the windowshades while they indulge.   General Mills Inc. advertises the ``unsinkability'' and lowsugar content of its Cheerios brand in advertising aimed at adultsand spins stories about the latest adventures of the Cheerios kidin commercials aimed at children.   Quaker Oats Co. found a few years ago that its Cap'n Crunchcereal was so popular at campus cafeterias that it devised aspecial version of a ``Find the Captain'' promotion for collegestudents.   Ronald Strauss, who follows the cereal business for theinvestment firm William Blair andamp; Co. in Chicago, said cereal makershave increasingly tried to market their products as something forall the family.   ``The demographics are changing. The average age of thepopulation is getting older and there are simply not as manyteenyboppers out there anymore,'' he said.   Celeste Clark, a spokeswoman for Kellogg, which is based inBattle Creek, Mich., said advertising pre-sweetened cereals toadults reminds them of the good tastes they enjoyed while they weregrowing up.   Frosted Flakes, for example, has been available for more than 35years and was initially marketed to children, she said.   But many of those who ate it years ago may now have children oftheir own and may be receptive to trying it again, she said.   Kellogg began advertising Frosted Flakes to adults five yearsago with the light-hearted approach that aims at reassuring them itis appropriate for adults to eat it, and Ms. Clark said the cerealnow leads the category.   Strauss said his figures confirm that, with Frosted Flakescapturing about 6 percent of the retail value of the ready-to-eatcereal market in 1986.   Ms. Clark said Kellogg has also fouind that while healthconcerns are driving some adults toward cereals with fruits, nutsand grains, a key factor in determining what cereal people buy isstill its taste.   Kathryn Newton, a spokeswoman for General Mills in Minneapolis,said advertising children's cereal to adults makes sense becauseadults make the purchases for all of them.   That was the principle motivation behind the Ralston sports carpromotion, said spokeswoman Sandra Harrington.   Ralston Purina began offering tiny sports car models in about 11million boxes of six of its children's cereals in February. Tenboxes of cereal contain a scale-model red Corvette, and those whofind the models can turn them in for the real thing, a 1988Chevrolet Corvette valued at about $29,000.   The promotion has been advertised nationally in newspapers andnetwork television commercials, the company said. Sales results arenot yet available.   ``We were looking for something that would appeal to parents aswell as kids,'' Ms. Harrington said.   She said the company doesn't know if the promotion will promptadults to try the cereals, but hopes that it will at least get themto buy it for their children. ``Maybe this will be the differencebetween having them pick up pour cereal or buying something else,''she said.</TEXT></DOC>
