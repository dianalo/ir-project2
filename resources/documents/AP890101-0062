At least four people died, apparently all in one Khartoumshooting incident, during four days of street violence last weekthat led to a general strike.   After the strike began Thursday, the government backed down,rescinding steep price increases and making salary hikes formillions of Sudanese retroactive to July 1.   The demonstrators then changed their focus mainly into a protestof Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi's failure to endorse a draft peaceaccord signed Nov. 16. The protests finally ended Saturday.   Trade unions and political parties also remain unsatisfied withthe government's stand. They scheduled a meeting with Mahdi onMonday to discuss further economic reforms and peace.   In a nationally broadcast speech marking Sudan's 33rd anniversaryof independence from Britain and Egypt, Mahdi named no names in hisbitter attack on demonstration organizers.   ``Some people want to make use of legal differences, some whohave been struck by madness,'' Mahdi said at a rally in el-Obeid,200 miles southwest of Khartoum. ``For them to try and develop thesedifferences into an uprising is harmful and wrong.   Mahdi promised political changes but didn't specify whether hemeant economic reforms or stepping up efforts to end the war.   ``Our next steps in the government are holding wide consultationsand serious, responsible studies to review our performance,'' hesaid in the speech broadcast over the official Omdurman Radio.   The Democratic Unionist Party, which negotiated the peace treatywith southern rebels, has quit the governing coalition. Partyleaders said they wanted to express sympathy with the strikers andto dramatize their outrage at Mahdis' handling of the proposedagreement to end Sudan's 5{-year-old civil war.   The Democratic Unionists dominate the 2-million-member SudaneseWorkers' Trade Union Federation, which brought the people into thestreets and called the general strike.   It acted after the government increased prices of essentialcommodities by up to 600 percent and imposed a 15-percentacross-the-board sales tax.   Government sources said the premier is expected to announce a newcoalition Tuesday with the fundamentalist National Islamic Frontreplacing the centrist Democratic Unionists as junior partner toMahdi's Umma Party.   In a radio message from the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa onSaturday, renegade army Col. John Garang, the rebel leader,described the outlook for peace in the New Year as bleak but said itcould have been promising. Garang blamed Mahdi's ignoring thetentative peace plan for the impasse in the peace process.   Rebel leader Garang took up arms in 1983 to fight theMoslem-dominated government in Khartoum for economic, social andpolitical changes in the mainly Christian and animist south.</TEXT></DOC>
