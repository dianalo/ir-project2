Therefore it must be expected, that changesof the emission of soil-CO/sub 2/ will easily reach an extent, whichis able to influence climatic changes as calculated due to an increaseof atmospheric CO/sub 2/. From long term measurements (4 years) of soilrespiration rates in connection with relevant ecological parameters itcan be shown, that the emission of soil-CO/sub 2/ increases exponentiallywith temperature. Applying the Arrhenius formalism to the temperaturedependence of soil respiration rates leads to a formal average activationenergy of 90,1 KJ/mole. So it can be shown, that a global increase ofthe mean surface temperature within the last hundred years has producedan additional CO/sub 2/-emission from soils in the range of 220 GtC.During the same interval burning of fuels only released 160 GtC in formof CO/sub 2/ to the atmosphere. As the 'glass house effect' of an increasingatmospheric CO/sub 2/-concentration would produce a further increasein CO/sub 2/-emission of soils, an enhanced increase of global temperaturescould only be stopped, if there would exist an additional sink for CO/sub2/ to compensate the increasing amount of atmospheric CO/sub 2/. Thereforefurther investigations tried to answer the question, if the soil organicmatter could play the role of a global sink for organic carbon. Withmethods of stable isotope geochemistry it has been possible to locatethe upper part of soils, where aerobic soil respiration takes place.Further on a model of the carbon fluxes leads to a calculation of thatpart of the steadily produced dead organic matter from the plants ofthe investigated ecosystem, which undergoes respirative decompositionwithin the soil profile.</TEXT></DOC>
