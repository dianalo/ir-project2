This action is a result of the November 24,1987, (52 FR 45132) rulemaking at which EPA disapproved North Dakota'sSIP for failing to comply with the provisions of 40 CFR 51.302 (visibilitygeneral plan requirements) and 51.306 (visibility LTS). EPA also incorporatedthese federal plans and regulations into North Dakota's SIP.The Governor of the State of North Dakota submitted a SIP revision on April18, 1989. The revision: (1) Established new and revised existing New SourcePerformance Standards, (2) updated existing State rules (including Preventionof Significant Deterioration regulations) and control strategies to addressPM-10, and (3) added a control strategy to address visibility protection.This action only addresses visibility protection; the other portions ofthe submittal will be addressed in separate actions.Review of the visibility protection plan indicates that North Dakota hasmet the criteria of 40 CFR 51.302 and 51.306, and that these revisionswill replace the federal visibility regulations of 40 CFR 52.29 in theNorth Dakota SIP.Also in this action, EPA is revising 40 CFR 81.423 to reflect that TheodoreRoosevelt National Memorial Park was renamed Theodore Roosevelt NationalPark.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>dates:</T2> This action will be effective on December 4, 1989, unlessnotice is received by November 6, 1989, that someone wishes to submit adverseor critical comments.

(``Mandatory Class I federal areas''(hereinafter Class I areas) are certain national parks, wilderness areas,and international parks, as described in section 162(a) of the Act, 42U.S.C. 7472(a), 40 CFR 81.400-81.437.) Section 169A specifically requiresEPA to promulgate regulations requiring certain states (including NorthDakota) to amend their State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to provide forvisibility protection.On December 2, 1980, EPA promulgated the required visibility regulationsin 45 FR 80084, codified at 40 CFR 51.300 <T3>et seq.</T3> It required the states to submit their revised SIPs tosatisfy those provisions by September 2, 1981. (See 45 FR 80091, codifiedin 40 CFR 51.302(a)(1).) That rulemaking resulted in numerous parties seekingjudicial review of the visibility regulations. In March 1981, the courtstayed the litigation, pending EPA action on related administrative petitionsfor reconsideration of the visibility regulations filed with the Agency.In December 1982, the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) filed suit in theU.S. Distrit Court for the Northern District of California alleging thatEPA failed to perform a nondiscretionary duty under section 110(c) of theAct to promulgate Visibility SIPs. A negotiated Settlement Agreement betweenEPA and EDF required EPA to determine the adequacy of state VisibilitySIPs to meet the general plan requirements including implementation controlstrategies (40 CFR 51.302), integral vista protection (40 CFR 51.302-307),and long-term strategies (LTS) (40 CFR 51.306). The Settlement Agreementrequired EPA to propose and promulgate federal Visibility SIPs (hereinafterFederal Implementation Plans (FIPS)) to remedy any deficiencies on a specifiedschedule. On January 23, 1986 (51 FR 3046), EPA preliminarily determinedthat the SIPs of 32 states (including North Dakota) were deficient withrespect to the above mentioned visibility provisions. The EPA and the plantiffs negotiated revisions to the Settlement Agreementwhich extended the deadlines for proposing FIPs to remedy the deficiencies.Under this revised Agreement, EPA must propose and promulgate FIPs to addressthe deficiencies relating to the general plan requirements and LTS, andcan defer proposing and promulgating FIPs to remedy deficiencies relatedto impairment which the Federal Land Managers (FLMs) have certified toEPA.On March 12, 1987 (52 FR 7802), EPA proposed to disapprove the SIPs of32 states (including North Dakota) for failing to meet the general planand LTS requirements of 40 CFR 51.302 and 51.306, and to incorporate thesefederal regulations into each state's SIP. The states were given the opportunityto avoid promulgation if they submitted SIP revisions to EPA by August31, 1987.On November 24, 1987, EPA disapproved SIPs for states (including NorthDakota) which failed to meet the requirements of 40 CFR 51.302 and 51.306.EPA also incorporated these federal regulations (40 CFR 52.29) into theSIPs of these states.On March 8, 1988, North Dakota submitted to EPA a draft Visibility SIPfor review. EPA's May 6, 1988, response to the State included commentsthat identified two problems with the draft SIP: (1) The FLM/State coordinationand control strategy requirements of 40 CFR 51.302 were not addressed,and (2) the State's description of the Class I areas was not consistentwith 40 CFR 81.423.On April 18, 1989, North Dakota submitted a SIP revision that includesa new ``Section 3.7, Control Strategy: Visibility'' in Chapter 3 of theImplementation Plan for the Control of Air Pollution (hereinafter ``Section3.7'') to comply with the federal provisions of 40 CFR 51.302 and 51.306.North Dakota has chosen not to protect integral vistas from visibilityimpairment at this time. However, the submittal meets the integral vistarequirements of 40 CFR 51.304.In response to EPA's May 6, 1988, comments, North Dakota included languagein the SIP submittal to adequately address the FLM/State coordination requirementsof 40 CFR 51.302. Also, EPA retracts the comment that the State did notinclude the necessary control strategy provisions of 40 CFR 51.302; theState only has to set-up the process to assess and address visibility impairment,which it has accomplished in the LTS. Concerning the issue of consistencywith 40 CFR 81.423, the State's listing of the Class I areas (see below)provides the public with a detailed description of the Class I areas presentedin 40 CFR 81.423, which EPA finds acceptable.<ITAG tagnum="84">Affected Areas</ITAG>The following areas in North Dakota are Class I areas where visibilityis an important value:<ITAG tagnum="25">The Theodore Roosevelt National Park_South Unit;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">The Theodore Roosevelt National Park_Elkhorn Ranch Unit;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">The Theodore Roosevelt National Park_North Unit;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">A portion of the Lostwood National Memorial Wildlife Refuge_The LostwoodNational Wilderness Area.</ITAG>These are listed in 40 CFR 81.423 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="25">Theodore Roosevelt National Park;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Lostwood National Wildlife Refuge.</ITAG>EPA is taking this opportunity to revise 40 CFR 81.423 to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="25">Theodore Roosevelt National Park;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Lostwood National Wildlife Refuge.</ITAG>Theodore Roosevelt National Memorial Park was re-named ``Theodore RooseveltNational Park'' on November 10, 1978.<ITAG tagnum="84">General Plan Requirements</ITAG>A. RequirementsThe visibility regulations provide general plan requirements for VisibilitySIPs. The general plan requirements of 40 CFR 51.302(c) require that theSIPs include: (1) An assessment of visibility impairment and a discussionof how each element of the plan relates to the national goal; (2) emissionlimitations, or other control measures, representing best available retrofittechnology (BART) for certain sources; (3) provisions to protect integralvistas; (4) provisions to address any existing impairment certified bythe FLM; and (5) an LTS (10 to 15 years) for making reasonable progresstoward the national goal.The North Dakota Visibility SIP reiterates these general plan requirementsthroughout Section 3.7, with the exception of ``3) provisions to protectintegral vistas.'' Since the State has not listed integral vistas in NorthDakota, the State need not address the mechanisms necessary to protectintegral vistas from impairment at this time.B. Control StrategiesThe regulations establish the following process for developing controlstrategies to remedy existing impairment. First, the State or the FLM identifiesthe Class I areas where visibility impairment exists. The regulations requirethe States to address in the SIP any impairment which has been certifiedat least six months prior to SIP submittal. (See 40 CFR 51.302(c)(4).)In identifying existing facilities which cause or contribute to the visibilityimpairment, the regulations require the State to adopt control strategiesonly to remedy impairment which has been reasonably attributed to a specificsource or group of sources. Although the FLMs may provide the State witha list of sources suspected of causing any existing impairment in the certification,the responsibility of identifying sources is the State's. (See 45 FR 80086,col. 3 and 40 CFR 51.302(c)(4)(i).)The State is required to perform a BART analysis for any existing stationaryfacility which has been identified as causing impairment in a Class I area.The State determines BART on a case-by-case basis taking into account thetechnology available, the costs of compliance, the energy and non-air qualityenvironmental impacts of compliance, the remaining useful life of the source,and the degree of improvement that can be anticipated to result from theuse of the controls. The State must adopt emission limitations representingBART which must be installed as expeditiously as practical, but no laterthan five years from SIP approval. (See 40 CFR 51.302(c)(4).)The State is not required to adopt emission limitations representing BARTif, for example, retrofit controls do not exist or are not anticipatedto result in improvements in visibility. (See 45 FR 80087, col. 1.) However,if a source has not been subject to BART because control technologies donot exist, and, if the Administrator determines that new technologies areavailable which would more effectively control that pollutant, the Statemust re-analyze for BART at that time. (See 40 CFR 51.302(c)(4)(v).)The regulations do not specify methods other than visual observation forcharacterizing visibility impairment. However, if a state is to adequatelyand timely address existing visibility impairment, a thorough characterizationmay be necessary. The EPA is aware that it, or the State, may find thatthe impairment cannot be attributed to specific sources and therefore cannotbe addressed under the existing visibility regulations. (See 52 FR 7804,col. 1.) A thorough characterization is important when a BART analysisis conducted so that the anticipated improvements in visibility may beestimated. The State or EPA may find that the impairment is attributableto minor stationary sources or to emissions from prescription fires. Inthese cases, the need for a control strategy to remedy the impairment isassessed as part of the LTS rather than BART. (See 52 FR 7804, col. 1.)Even though visibility impairment due to a source or small group of sourceshas not been identified in North Dakota's Class I areas, the North DakotaVisibility SIP contains provisions in Section 3.7 which address the abovecontrol strategies. (A significant amount of detail on the developmentof federal control strategies is contained in 52 FR 7802 (March 12, 1987).)C. Assessment of Visibility ImpairmentThe EPA reviewed the information provided by the Department of Interior(DOI) to determine if impairment (1) appeared to occur in North Dakota'sClass I areas, and (2) if impairment was a type which may be traceableto specific sources. The information provided by the FLMs indicated thatno Class I area in North Dakota is experiencing visibility impairment whichmay be traceable to specific sources.The EPA is aware that the FLMs may in the future provide additional informationon this impairment which would allow EPA or a state to attribute it toa specific source. In such cases, Section 3.7 commits North Dakota to reviewthe information under the procedure described above and in the periodicreview of the LTS discussed below.<ITAG tagnum="84">Long-term Strategy</ITAG>A. RequirementsThe regulations require that the LTS be a 10 to 15 year plan for makingreasonable progress toward the national goal. The LTS must cover any existingimpairment that the FLM certified at least six months before plan submission.A LTS must be developed which covers each Class I area within the Stateand each Class I area in another state that may be affected by sourceswithin the State. The strategy must be coordinated with existing plansand goals for a Class I area including those of the FLMs. The strategymust state with reasonable specificity why it is adequate for making reasonableprogress toward the national goal. The LTS and SIP must provide for reviewof the impact of new sources as required by 40 CFR 51.307.The State must consider at a minimum the following six factors in the LTS:1. Emission reductions due to ongoing air pollution control programs;2. Additional emission limitations and schedules for compliance;3. Measures to mitigate the impacts of construction activities;4. Source retirement and replacement schedules;5. Smoke management (techniques for agricultural and forestry managementpurposes including such plans as currently exist within the State for thesepurposes); and6. Enforcement for emission limitations and control measures.The State must commit to periodic review for the SIP on a schedule notless frequent than every three years. A periodic report must be developedin consultation with the FLMs and must contain the following:1. Progress achieved in remedying existing impairment;2. The ability of the LTS to achieve reasonable progress toward the nationalgoal;3. Any change in visibity conditions since the last report or since planapproval;4. Additional measures, including the need for SIP revisions, that maybe necessary to achieve progress toward the national goal;5. The progress achieved in implementing Best Available Retrofit Technology(BART) and meeting other schedules laid out in the LTS to remedy existingimpairment; and6. The impact of any BART exemption granted.The North Dakota Visibility SIP includes provisons which address thesefederal LTS requirements listed above throughout Section 3.7. Additionalinformation concerning the federal LTS requirements is contained in 52FR 7802 (March 12, 1987). B. RemediesThe existing visibility regulations are designed to address impairmentwhich can be traced to specific sources. Although visibility impairmentwhich is reasonably attributable to a source or small group of sourceshas not been identified by the EPA, State, or FLMs in North Dakota, thefederal LTS establishes a mechanism to address any additional impairmentwhich may be certified in the future. Although EPA intends for these discussionsto be the federal remedy, North Dakota must develop its own LTS when developingthe Visibility SIP.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Ongoing Air Pollution Control Programs</ITAG>The regulations require that each LTS provide for the review of the potentialimpact on visibility of new major stationary sources or major modificationsin accordance with 40 CFR 51.307. The regulations further require thateach SIP contain a discussion of the effect of ongoing air pollution controlprograms on remedying existing and preventing future impairment of visibility.The North Dakota Visibility SIP has met these requirements. EPA approvedthe North Dakota NSR program for visibility protection on September 28,1988 (53 FR 37757), and North Dakota discusses its ongoing programs inSection 3.7 of the SIP. These ongoing programs include:(a) The review of major stationary sources that are subject to the State'sPrevention of Significant Deterioration of Air Quality Rules (PSD);(b) Inspecting sources that could potentially affect visibility in ClassI areas to ensure that the required air pollution control equipment isoperating and to ensure that allowable emission limits are not being exceeded;(c) Enforcement of the State's open burning regulations;(d) Encouraging the processing of natural gas to remove sulfur from oilwells that are currently flaring in the vicinity of Class I areas;(e) Enforcement of the State's ambient air quality standards for sulfurdioxide, particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide;(f) Controlling fugitive emissions, through permit conditions, during constructionactivities; and (g) Developing BART rules should any existing impairment be identified.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Smoke Management Practices</ITAG>The FLMs have not specifically identified smoke from prescribed fires asa cause of visibility impairment in North Dakota's Class I areas. NorthDakota currently regulates controlled or ``open'' burning in Chapter 33-15-04of the North Dakota Air Pollution Control Rules (NDAPCR). North Dakotaprohibits open burning for agriculture and forest management practicesand the disposal of liquid hydrocarbons, if the burning would have an adverseimpact on visibility in Class I areas.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Future Certifications of Impairment</ITAG>Under the revised Settlement Agreement, EPA must address existing deficienciesin Visibility SIPs. Thus, EPA has only addressed the certifications ofimpairment in Class I areas made by the FLMs prior to June 1, 1988. TheEPA is aware, however, that information may become available which indicatesthe existence of additional visibility impairment within the Class I areasor which may allow EPA or the State to attribute impairment to a specificsource which could not be addressed at this time. A discussion of how anyfuture impairment will be addressed may be found in 40 CFR 51.302(c). NorthDakota has committed in Section 3.7 to address any future visibility impairmentidentified by a FLM or the State through: (a) The NSR program, (b) theenforcement of emission limits and ambient air quality standards, and (c)the 3-year periodic review process. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Existing Visibility Impairment</ITAG>Because the FLMs have not identified existing visibility impairment inany of North Dakota's Class I areas, discussions related to source impact(such as additional emission limitations, source retirement and replacement,construction activities, and enforceability of emission limitations) arenot required in the SIP at this time. North Dakota, however, discussessource impact mitigation measures in Section 3.7, which include:(a) Emission reductions due to ongoing air pollution control activities;(b) Additional emission limitations and schedules for compliance;(c) Measures to mitigate the impacts of construction activities;(d) Source retirement and replacement schedules;(e) Smoke management techniques; and(f) Enforcement of emission limitations and control measures.North Dakota has also committed to develop BART rules should any existingimpairment [due to a source or small group of sources] be identified ina Class I area.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Periodic Review</ITAG>EPA regulations require that the LTS be reviewed and revised, if necessary,every three years. During this review, the results of any monitoring programwill be considered, the FLMs will be consulted, and a report will be preparedwhich discusses the progress toward the national goal. North Dakota hascommitted to this three-year periodic review of the LTS.<T3>Final Action:</T3> The April 18, 1989, submittal by the Governor ofNorth Dakota includes the visibility general plan and long-term strategyrequirements of 40 CFR 51.302 and 51.306 and the criteria discussed in52 FR 45132 (November 24, 1987). (See March 12, 1987 (52 FR 7802), foradditional information.) The State commits to a review of the VisibilitySIP every three years, making any changes deemed necessary. The SIP, therefore,has established the commitment to review the visibility requirements listedin 40 CFR Part 51 Subpart P_Protection of Visibility. The approval willreplace the federal plans and regulations of 40 CFR 52.29 (visibility long-termstrategies) in the North Dakota SIP.EPA hereby approves the revisions to the North Dakota Visibility SIP forthe general plan requirements and the long-term strategies.EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agencyviews this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments.This action will be effective 60 days from the date of the <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice unless, within 30 days of its publication,notice is received that adverse or critical comments will be submitted.If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effectivedate by publishing two subsequent notices. One notice will withdraw thefinal action and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposalof the action and establishing a comment period. If no such comments arereceived, the public is advised that this action will be effective December4, 1989.EPA finds good cause exists for making the action taken in this noticeimmediately effective because the implementation plan revisions are alreadyin effect under State law or regulation, and EPA's approval poses no additionalregulatory burden.Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this SIP revision will not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.(See 46 FR 8709.)Under Section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of thisaction must be filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuitby (60 days from publication). This action may not be challenged laterin proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See 307(b)(2).)This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administratorunder the procedures published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225). On January6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions(54 FR 2222) from the requirements of Section 3 of Executive Order 12291for a period of two years.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>40 CFR Part 52Air pollution control, Particulate matter. 40 CFR Part 81Air pollution control, National parks, Wilderness areas.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 14, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jack McGraw, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Regional Administrator.</ITAG>Parts 52 and 81 chapter I, title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulationsis amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 52_[AMENDED]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart JJ_North Dakota</ITAG>The authority citation for part 52 continues to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 42 U.S.C. 7401-7642.</ITAG>2.
