If you need to scansmall or delicate pieces of paper, forget sheetfed scanners.andP;  How often willI scan? If you have high-volume requirements, consider a scanner that canautomatically feed a stack of documents.andP;  How will I output my scans? Ifyou're going to use your scans in a HyperCard stack instead of printing themin a newsletter, you don't need a high-resolution scanner.andP;  To start you offon the road to the perfect scanner, here's a summary of the types of scannersthat are available:andM;Flatbed scanners.andP;  If you've used a photocopier, you understand the basics offlatbed scanning.andP;  Lift up the lid, place your original image facedown on theglass, and begin your scan.andP;  A motorized scan head moves underneath thelength of the glass bed and analyzes the image one line at a time.andM;Although flatbed models are used primarily for capturing gray-scale and colorphotographs, they can accept virtually anything that lies flat on the bed,from doodle-covered napkins to bound books.andM;This flexibility isn't without its disadvantages, though.andP;  If you're scanningstacks of paper, manually swapping originals soon becomes tiresome.andP;  Forhigh-volume tasks, look for an optional automatic document feeder or considera sheetfed scanner.andM;Sheetfed scanners.andP;  You place your document in a feeder bin, and rollers pullit past a stationary scan head just as with a fax machine.andP;  The problem withthis approach is that originals can easily become misaligned, resulting inpoor scans and even paper jams.andP;  Also, the thickness and size of originalsare limited.andP;  You can't stuff a book through the rollers, and small piecescan get stuck.andM;Sheetfed scanners typically come with automatic document feeders that holdmany sheets of paper, so they are very popular for unattended OCR work.andO;Because of alignment problems and limited gray-scale capabilities, sheetfedscanners can handle only relatively undemanding graphics tasks such asacquiring low-resolution images.andM;Overhead scanners.andP;  Overhead scanners (sometimes called copyboard scanners)look like miniature stat cameras.andP;  Place your original faceup on the scanningbed, and a small overhead tower containing the optical mechanism slowlypasses over it, scanning the image.andM;In addition to being able to deal with loose sheets of paper of almost anysize, overhead scanners can handle bound books and three-dimensional objects,depending on their depth of field, although focusing can be a problem.andP;  Andbecause of the &quot;open air&quot; design of overhead scanners, obtaining evenillumination can be difficult.andM;Hand-held scanners.andP;  Hand-held scanners are like mice with eyes.andP;  You rollthem over your original, and the digital information runs down the tail andinto your Mac.andP;  Because they are so small, hand-held scanners are portableand convenient.andP;  They are commonly used to scoop up logos, signatures, andsmall pieces of line art.andP;  What's more, they can scan anything within reach -including a brick wall if you want an interesting texture map for your3-D-modeling program.andM;The major attraction of hand-held scanners is their low price.andP;  Somedisadvantages include limited scanning area (usually a swath no wider than 5inches) and alignment problems that come from using the human hand to controlthe scan.andM;Slide scanners.andP;  Slide scanners are like self-contained 35mm slide projectorsand screens, with the projector pointing inward at a small screen array oftiny photodetectors.andP;  As light passes through a photographic transparency andstrikes the photodetectors, the image is translated into thousands of pixels.andM;Because 35mm slides are continuous-tone images, the resulting scans arehigh-resolution, with excellent color fidelity and saturation.andP;  Slidescanners are better than flatbed scanners for color photographs because theyhave higher resolution and work with illuminated, rather than reflected,light.andP;  The drawback is that slide scanners are typically more expensive andslower than traditional scanners and, of course, they work only on slides.andM;How it Wopks: Monochrome and Gpay-Scale Scanners scan resembles a photocopyof the original.andM;To decide which scanner type best suits your intended use, ask yourself somequestions: What types of originals am I going to scan?
