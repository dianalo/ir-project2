Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, told the court Thursday thathe visited Islamic holy sites at Qom and Mashhad, traveling viaTehran. Asked by the judge to give a date for his trip, Hamadifirst said he could not remember but later said it could have beenin 1985.   Hamadi has said he spent two years as a fighter with the Amalmilitia in Beirut, but has repeatedly denied being a member ofHezbollah, a radical, Iran-backed Shiite Moslem group in Lebanon.   The group is believed to be an umbrella organization forkidnappers holding foreign hostages in Lebanon. One of Hamadi'sbrothers, Abdul-Hadi, is Hezbollah's security chief.   The TWA jetliner was hijacked in June 1985 on a flight fromAthens to Rome.   U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem of Waldorf, Maryland, was shotand killed after the hijackers forced the plane to land in Beirut.Thirty-nine Americans were held hostage during the 17-day ordeal.   A court document introduced Thursday also indicated that Hamadiwas being sought on a murder charge in Beirut in 1983.   The document, read by Chief Judge Heiner Mueckenberger, gave nodetails. Hamadi said he was not aware of the charges.   The document was obtained after West German federalinvestigators asked authorities in Lebanon for assistance in theirinvestigation of Hamadi.   Hamadi's defense attorneys questioned the value of the documentas evidence, saying it was an unsigned telex with few details.   Hamadi also said that he smuggled explosives into West Germanybecause he was afraid of ``committing a sin'' against Islam.   ``I did not say no because I'm a Moslem and its my duty to obeythose who are wiser,'' Hamadi said, referring to a man he saidordered him to smuggle liquid explosives into West Germany.   ``The Koran says obey Allah, obey the prophet and obey those whogive you orders. I was afraid of committing a sin if I did notaccept.''   He refused to identify the man who ordered him to smuggle theexplosives.   On Wednesday, Hamadi admitted bringing explosives into WestGermany on two occasions. He was arrested at Frankfurt airport inJanuary 1987 when liquid explosives were found in his luggage, buthe said he had succeeded in smuggling another shipment a few weeksearlier.   In other testimony, Hamadi said he fought in southern Lebanonagainst Israeli forces and took part in street battles in Beirutagainst ``government soldiers'' and Christian Phalangist militiamenin Lebanon between 1984 and 1987.   He said he had been wounded in the arm by a bullet in streetingfighting in 1985, but could not remember if his arm was still in acast in June, when the hijacking took place.   Hamadi has testified that he was a member of the Shiite MoslemAmal militia from 1980 to 1982. He said he also took part infighting during that period.   He arrived in West Germany late in 1982 and applied forpolitical asylum, but returned to Lebanon in November 1984 afterhis request was turned down.   West Germany last year rejected a U.S. request for Hamadi'sextradition.   A Duesseldorf court sentenced one of his brothers, Abbas AliHamadi, to 13 years in prison in April for the January 1987kidnappings of two West Germans in Beirut in an attempt to gainMohammed's freedom.   The trial is scheduled to continue on Tuesday.</TEXT></DOC>
