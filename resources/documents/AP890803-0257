Losses from the misuse of pension funds could total $4 billion,twice the estimated losses in the HUD scandal, according to a LaborDepartment study cited by Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., chairman ofthe House Government Operations subcommittee.   The level of corruption among 870,000 private pension plans hasmushroomed despite enactment of the 1974 Employment RetirementIncome Security Act, the subcommittee was told.   ``When similar early warnings were ignored about the savings andloan industry and about HUD program administration, the cost to theAmerican taxpayer and economy became staggering,'' Lantos said.   Maria said there are several parallels between the savings andloan crisis and problems that have surfaced in reviews of pensionplan audits.   Among them are the size of the amounts of money involved, hesaid, noting pension funds hold about $1.7 trillion in assetscompared with nearly $1 trillion in federally insured deposits heldby Sandamp;Ls.   Also, he said, the government ultimately must insure pensionersagainst the loss of promised benefits, just like Sandamp;L depositors areinsured against the loss of their deposits.   However, Maria said there are fewer than 300 federal auditorsexamining pension funds _ about one-twelfth the number of federalSandamp;L examiners.   Maria said efforts by his office to address the problem havebeen frustrated by opposition from officials in a department``which historically has turned its back on criminal sanctions.''   He cited a Justice Department opinion last March sought by theLabor Department's former solicitor that limited his office'sinvestigative role to union-affiliated plans.   In a sample study of 168 private pension plans with $6.7 billionin total assets, Maria's office found $18.7 million in misusedfunds that was either lost or undisclosed in private audits bypublic accountants.   The independent auditors failed to perform suggested auditprocedures in 31 percent of the cases, he said, and 51 percent ofthe audits lacked one or more disclosures required under the 1974pension law.   ``Further, we found that (independent audit) reports do not givea fair opinion of the state of these plans'' because pension lawand Labor Department regulations allow ``limited scope reviews,''Maria said.   Those audits omit examination of any pension plan assets held intrust by banks, insurance companies, Sandamp;Ls and other financialinstitutions regulated by the government, he said. He suggested thepension law be changed to eliminate exemptions in auditingprocedures.   Maria said Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole and her staff appear``sensitive'' to the problem ``in direct contrast to previousyears'' but added he remains skeptical that recommendations forreforms will be adopted.   Deputy Labor Secretary Roderick DeArment questioned whether fullaudits would be worth the cost but said his department is examiningthe proposal.   He also characterized as ``an historical phenomenon'' Maria'scomplaint that the department has thwarted the pursuit of criminalcharges for violations of pension and other labor laws.   ``I certainly don't have any aversion to criminalinvestigations,'' DeArment said. ``Stealing from pensioners isabout as odious a crime as I can imagine.''</TEXT></DOC>
