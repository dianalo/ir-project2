(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The streets of this western Pennsylvaniecommunity sparkle, but not because they're paved with gold.   USX Corp., which owns the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock, onWednesday said it would investigate the cause of coatings ofsparkling dust on sidewalks and streets.   The dust damaged the paint on three nuns' cars at the GoodShepherd Church.   ``People have complained of damage to their cars and otherpainted surfaces,'' said Ronald Chleboski, deputy director of thecounty's Air Pollution Control Bureau.   The dust concentrations exceed Pennsylvania standards, Chleboskisaid.   The steel mill is most likely responsible for the dust levels,because they were reduced 44 percent during a steelworkers' strikein 1986 and 1987, he said.   The dust has appeared several mornings a week during the pastthree months, said Monsignor Charles Owen Rice, a member of theAllegheny County Board of Health.   USX's steel division will start a study of the dust within amonth and report to the health board within five months, saidRichard Dworek, director of environmental controls in the steeldivision.</TEXT></DOC>
