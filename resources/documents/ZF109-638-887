(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>CIM to the rescueandM;Electronic Data Systems Corp. (EDS) designed a system that let General MotorsCorp. completely redesign its full-size-pickup truck assembly plant.andP;  It is aquintessential example of how factories and computers work in a flexibleenvironment.andM;EDS, a GM subsidiary, carried out system architecture, training, softwaredesign and hardware acquisition and installation for Pontiac East Assemblyand other facilities during the years of rebuilding.andP;  This work was performedin cooperation with the GM Truck andamp; Bus group.andP;  EDS now maintains 60 employeesat Pontiac East Assembly who work on systems engineering, operations andadministrative and financial matters.andM;&quot;Our major job has been to use the requirements of the plant to determinewhat software runs at different levels of the hardware architecture,&quot; saysGary Budzinski, EDS account manager at the Pontiac East Assembly facility.andM;GM's information systems goals at Pontiac East Assembly, according toBudzinki, have been to reduce redundancy and paperwork.andP;  This reduction muststart from the time a vehicle is ordered to the time it leaves the factory.andO;The auto company turned to computer integrated manufacturing (CIM) to achievethese goals.andM;CIM guides vehicles through the plant's body shop (where welding and otheroperations take place), paint shop and general-assembly areas.andP;  At PontiacEast Assembly, CIM takes the following form:andM;* A hierarchical hardware architecture that incorporates platforms fromAllen-Bradley Co., Digital Equipment Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. and IBMCorp.;andM;* Factory-floor networks;andM;* Sixty-three software applications in such areas as vehicle-orderprocessing, shipping-control system, flexible scheduling and materialmanagement.andM;The GM-EDS team made an early decision to employ a five-layer architecturefor controlling automated manufacturing processes within the plant.andP;  Programinteraction among the layers is best understood by proceeding from the bottomup.andM;Level 5: Plant-floor devices.andP;  Programmable controllers, robots, visionsystems, weld timers and optical scanners are the front-line devices that areessential to automating production processes at Pontiac East Assembly.andP;  &quot;Theguiding principle is to use automation if it contributes to the quality ofour product and if the cost and maturity of automation technology warrant itsacquisition,&quot; says Budzinski.andP;  &quot;We don't use technology for technology'ssake.&quot;andM;Robots, for example, handle 99 percent of truck cab and box welds, most tasksinvolving the application of sealant along cab and box seams and allapplications of vehicle base paint coats and clear coats.andM;GMF Robotics supplies most of these robots.andP;  ASEA Brown Boveri Robotics Inc.andO;and Cincinnati Milacron Inc. robots can also be found at the plant.andM;More than 300 Allen-Bradley PLC-2 and PLC-3 programmable controllers directrobots, controllers regulate the speed of conveyors and give commands toSquare D Co.'s Pertron weld timers.andP;  Weld timers pass information to robotson how long and with what pressure welds should be applied.andM;And five different vision systems from Perceptron Inc. perform such tasks asinspecting truck boxes and doors and ensuring that parts going through thewelding process are the right size.andM;Optical scanners are another important shop-floor device.andP;  A bar code isphysically built into each metal framework that carries truck componentsthrough Acco Industries Inc.'s conveyor system.andP;  More than 100 SmarteyeReaders, which are floor-mounted scanners from Smart-eye Corp., record thepassage of carriers through various manufacturing stages and report tocomputers tracking the timing and completion of jobs.andM;Level 4: Cell controllers.andP;  Clusters of plant-floor devices are directed byHP 1000 cell controllers.andP;  Among other functions, they pass downjob-scheduling data from higher level machines and send data gathered bySmarteye Readers up the line so that carriers can be scheduled, routed andlocated throughout the plant.andM;DEC MicroVAXes also carry out several functions at the cell level.andP;  Theycontrol systems that test speedometers and other electrical parts.andP;  And theyverify the identification of vehicle components--such as engines, axles andantilock brake modules--passing through the general assembly area.andM;Level 3: Area managers.andP;  DEC VAX 8600s manage broad areas of the plant.andO;Applications handled by these machines include:andM;* Statistical process control--information from test and inspection systemsis used to track process trends throughout the factory;andM;* Inspection feedback--verifies the integrity of paint applications;andM;* Vehicle Processing System--tracks the vehicle assembly process withinformation provided by Smarteye Readers and provides vehicle-option data toother real-time systems;andM;* Maintenance Management System--schedules preventive maintenance;andM;* Facilities Monitoring and Control System--used by area managers forannunciating alarms to computer terminals in the plant if, for instance,automated tasks take longer than scheduled.andM;Area managers also serve as a central repository for all programmablecontroller programs, in case these devices are affected by power outages orprogram problems.andM;Level 2: Plant hosts.andP;  IBM 4381s function at the highest computing levelwithin the plant.andP;  At least two major applications run at this level:andM;* Flexible Scheduling System--used by host computers to pass alonginformation on vehicle job schedules and send vehicle-option data toterminals and laser printers on the floor;andM;* Shipping Control System--verifies that vehicles have passed required testsbefore they leave the plant for shipping.andM;Level 1: Information Processing Centers (IPCs).andP;  EDS operates IPCs that carryout batch and on-line data processing for GM's facilities as well as forother EDS customers.andP;  (See SYSTEMS INTEGRATION, February 1990, Page 34.)andP;  TwoIPCs--one in Auburn Hills, MI, and the other in Plano, TX--provideengineering, CAD/CAM and administrative and financial services for PontiacEast Assembly.andM;IPCs process the plant's accounts, payroll and general ledger.andP;  They alsostore vehicle-test information and monitor whether or not truck seats,engines and other materials critical for assembling vehicles are received atthe plant as scheduled.andM;And IPCs establish job sequences for the plant.andP;  This process begins whenvehicle orders are transmitted to the Plano IPC by dealers.andP;  &quot;All theinformation we need to build a truck, such as paint color and part numbers,becomes part of the Plant Vehicle Database in Plano,&quot; says Dave Butcher, anEDS advanced systems engineer.andP;  &quot;That database, in turn, is a subset of theVehicle Ordering System, which passes out jobs to Pontiac East Assembly andother plants.&quot;andM;Butcher says: &quot;Vehicle-specific information is downloaded nightly from thevehicle database to the Flexible Scheduling System maintained in hostcomputers at Pontiac East Assembly.&quot;andM;The order in which jobs are performed is determined by an Auto Sequencerprogram that works with the Vehicle Ordering System at the IPC.andP;  Thesequencer program consists of a set of rules established by GM for optimalwork sequences.andM;&quot;You don't want to have two four-wheel-drive trucks built in a row, forexample, because four-wheelers require labor-intensive work,&quot; says Kris Rose,another EDS advanced systems engineer.andP;  &quot;It makes better use of our resourcesto spread them out through the manufacturing sequence.&quot;andM;Similar decisions must be made about the sequence in which other truckoptions--such as paint colors, transmissions and rear axles--are carried outin particular manufacturing areas.andM;Initial sequencing information for jobs in the body shop, where truck cab andbox components first enter the plant, is also transmitted to the FlexibleScheduling System from the IPC.andP;  Host computers then send vehicle data in theappropriate job sequence to body shop plant-floor terminals.andP;  Such data isprinted out in run sheets, which inform workers about parts to be used on thenext job.andP;  Run sheets are also printed in the general assembly area, based onresequencing information processed as vehicles pass through the paint shop.andM;A broadband backboneandM;Pontiac East Assembly's hardware layers are seamlessly linked by severalinterconnected networks.andM;Approximately 20 miles of broadband coaxial cable arrayed in a bus topologycomprise the backbone physical medium for HP's cell controllers.andP;  Thebroadbank system enables plant hosts and area managers to communicate withcell controllers and to receive information sent to cell controllers fromlower level devices.andM;&quot;Broadband has several benefits,&quot; says Budzinski.andP;  &quot;Broadband bus technology,for example, promotes flexible manufacturing.andP;  Taps to the backbone areplaced on posts throughout the plant.andP;  So, you can easily connect anddisconnect devices or move peripherals around the factory floor withoutpulling additional cable.andP;  You just tie a device into the nearest cable tap.andO;The system knows the new address.&quot;andM;Broadband cable is shielded from electromagnetic noise emitted by certainfactory devices.andP;  It allows for a range of frequencies over multiple channelsfor communications among cell controllers, robots, programmable controllers,terminals and other equipment connected to the cable.andM;Version 2.1 of GM's Manufacturing Automation Protocol (MAP) runs over thecable.andP;  MAP has been heavily promoted by GM as a way to lower manufacturingcosts.andP;  It accomplishes this by using a common communications protocol tointegrate multivendor factory automation systems over a standard networktopology.andM;Functionally, MAP is a seven-layer protocol stack based on a subset of theInternational Standards Organization (ISO) Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)model.andM;At the physical layer and data link layer, MAP specifies use of the IEEE802.4 token-bus standard.andP;  Data may be transmitted up to 10M bits per second(bps) over the MAP cable.andM;Pontiac East Assembly registered the first use of MAP in a productionenvironment and it is the largest MAP 2.1 installation in the world,according to GM.andP;  The plant's EDS staff is enthusiastic about the system,although MAP has not grown as fast as GM had hoped among other U.S.andO;manufacturers.andP;  (See &quot;It's getting easier to achieve enterprise-wide CIM.&quot;)andM;&quot;MAP has been very reliable for us,&quot; says Rose.andP;  &quot;Without MAP, we would havehad to go through the expense and labor of installing protocol converters toenable dissimilar equipment to talk.&quot;andM;Proprietary networks extend from cell controllers to factory-floor devices.andO;These links include:andM;* Allen-Bradley's Data Highway--a high-speed, token-passing networkconnecting cell controllers and programmable controllers;andM;* Square D's Pernet--a network that ties cell controllers to weld timers.andM;And Ungerman-Bass Inc.'s NetOne system interfaces factory-floor terminals tothe same broadband cable running MAP.andM;Just-in-time strategyandM;Above the cell level, VAX area managers and IBM hosts are hooked together byDECnet and Systems Network Architecture (SNA) networks, respectively.andP;  An EDSsoftware product called Autoway interfaces factory application programs onthe VAXes to MAP, while an SNA gateway passes information between VAXes andthe IBM hosts.andP;  Finally, cell-level MicroVAXes are directly connected toDECnet.andM;GM does not yet have a full-blown electronic data interchange (EDI) systembetween parts suppliers and Pontiac East Assembly.andP;  EDI allows suppliers andcustomers to exchange and verify product orders electronically.andM;But close communications are maintained between Pontiac East Assembly andsome vendors to benefit from the just-in-time strategy for minimizinginventories--thus cutting warehouse expenses and reducing damage to parts.andM;Lear Seating Corp., a Romulus, MI, seat manufacturer, is one vendor thatmaintains an EDI-type system with Pontiac East Assembly.andP;  &quot;At 3:30 everymorning, an IBM 360 at Lear Seating receives information over dedicated phonelines on how many types of seats general assembly workers will need forpickup trucks during the day ahead,&quot; says Rose.andM;&quot;We know how many types of seats are required from job-tracking data gatheredby the Vehicle Processing and Flexible Scheduling systems in the paint shopon the night before vehicles go to general assembly.andP;  Exact seat orders arethen placed in real-time throughout the day and are based on vehiclesactually leaving the paint shop.andP;  Lear Seating loads the seats sent toPontiac East Assembly in the exact order that they will be placed on specificpickup trucks.&quot;andM;Rose adds: &quot;We have a limited amount of inventory on hand.andP;  Only two hourspass from the time a seat arrives before it is put into a pickup truck.&quot;andM;Programs schedule paint jobsandM;Pontiac East Assembly's paint shop offers a good example of how hardwarelayers, networks and software applications work to help GM turn out pickuptrucks.andM;The conveyor system carries a partially completed pickup truck from the bodyshop to the paint shop.andP;  At this stage, a pickup truck is still bare sheetmetal.andM;Proceeding along, the first stop in the paint shop in full submersion in aphosphate dip that helps the sheet metal resist corrosion.andP;  Next is asubmersion in ELPO, a primer, for additional corrosion protection.andP;  If avehicle remains in either bath longer than required, workers would be alertedby an appropriate alarm sent to terminals by the area manager's FacilitiesMonitoring and Control System.andM;Robots then apply sealant along cab and box seams.andP;  Anti-chip material issprayed on the bottom seven inches of the vehicle's sheet metal and thepickup truck is then sent through large bake ovens.andM;Now, the pickup truck is ready to enter an enclosed &quot;clean room&quot; forpainting.andP;  Six paint modules for monotone paints and three for two-tone andrepair are arrayed in parallel lines across the room.andP;  Each module consistsof two back-to-back booths.andP;  Robots in the first booth apply the base coat;in the other booth, robots spray on the clear coat for a high-gloss finish.andO;At any given time, some modules may be undergoing preventive maintenance.andM;Pickup trucks are routed from a waiting area to the appropriate moduleaccording to sequencing instructions worked out by the area manager's PaintShop Applications program.andP;  &quot;For example, decision-making rules wouldlogically call for sending two pickup trucks scheduled for red paint to thesame module because it is costly to purge the line to apply new colors,&quot; saysRose.andM;The area manager then sends its orders down the line.andP;  Cell controllers areinstructed to tell the appropriate programmable controllers to &quot;ship thistruck along the conveyor track going to this particular module.&quot;andP;  Robots aretold what color to paint and the vehicle body style for each pickup truck.andO;Body style is important because it determines preprogrammed paint pathsfollowed by robots.andM;As each pickup truck goes by its module, that information is pickup up bySmarteye Readers and sent on to the area manager's job-tracking VehicleProcessing System.andM;The pickup trucks must pass muster at the paint-inspection deck beforeleaving the clean room.andP;  &quot;Defects detected by the paint-inspection systemmight include dirt or overspraying,&quot; says Rose.andP;  &quot;Operators enter inspectionresults in terminals.andP;  Based on such information, the vehicle either goes onto a resequencer system or it is pulled off the line and scheduled to go backto separate repair modules in the clean room.andP;  Robots are told exactly whatparts of the vehicle may need repainting.&quot;andM;Pickup trucks in the resequencer must now be placed in the right sequence bythe Flexible Scheduling System for their travels to the general-assemblydepartment.andM;&quot;A traditional plant could maintain the exact original sequence of workbecause every pickup truck remains in line from the body shop on,&quot; says Rose.andO;&quot;But here, the sequence can change because of our use of multiple modules tooptimize paint economics, additional processing required by two-tone jobs andthe occasional need to put pickup trucks through the repair loop.&quot;andM;EDS is responsible for the resequencer operation because this processinvolves all parts of the network hierarchy more intimately than do otherparts of the plant.andP;  And EDS also has expertise immediately available toaddress any problems that may arise.andM;&quot;If we stop moving jobs through here to clear up problems, processes in thenext assembly section will be waiting for work within 20 minutes,&quot; claimsRose.andP;  &quot;So, information about which vehicles are ready to move on must passcleanly through the resequencer to the general-assembly shop if we are tomaintain production at 60 pickup trucks per hour.&quot;andP;  As the pickup truckpasses by Samrteye Readers on the way out of the paint shop, its departuresignals the Flexible Scheduling System to print run sheets for the workersthat are next in line.andM;At the end of this long assembly line, a Final Vehicle Shipping softwareprogram assigns each pickup truck to a rail car or transport truck.andP;  Theconveyor system then carries pickup trucks to their assigned waiting areas sothey can be immediately shipped throughout the world.andM;GM knows that it took substantial risks in modernizing Pontiac East Assemblyand several related plants, as well as in redesigning its pickup truck modelline.andP;  Planning for GMT (General Motors Truck) 400, the code name given tothe project for a new family of pickups, began in 1982.andP;  The manufacturing ofpickup trucks began on schedule in September 1986.andP;  All the pickup truckassembly plants also started work on the same day.andM;Ron Frizzell, production manager ofr GM Truck andamp; Bus Group's Pontiac EastAssembly, says: &quot;We knew that GM did not have a winning reputation forsuccessful new model start-ups in those years.andP;  We were carrying out a directreplacement for an existing product, leaving no room for major problems.andO;This was a program that had to succeed.andP;  It did.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
