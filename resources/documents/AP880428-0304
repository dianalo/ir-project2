Lay, Enron chairman.   Enron Oil andamp; Gas had reserves of 1.42 trillion cubic feet ofnatural gas and 42.3 million barrels of oil as of the end of 1987.   For the entire year, it sold an average of 343 million cubicfeet of natural gas and 12,000 barrels of oil per day.   For the first three months of 1988, that rate has risen to 399million cubic feet of gas and 13,000 barrels of oil, the companysaid.   ``Assuming completion of a sale, we will be realizing for ourshareholders the tremendous value inherent in these assets undercurrent favorable market conditions,'' Lay said.   He said proceeds from a sale would be used to reduce Enron'sindebtedness and interest expense and enhance near-term earningsand future cash flow.   Lay, speaking at Enron's annual meeting Thursday, said debtreduction was a major goal for 1988. Debt as a percentage ofcapitalization stood at 75.6 at the end of 1987 and was reduced to67 percent by the end of the first quarter.   Enron earlier Thursday reported first-quarter earnings of $69.4million, or $1.20 per share, compared with $62.7 million, or $1.06per share, for the year-earlier period.   ``Among the primary causes was a return to more normal wintertemperature patterns than the relatively warm heating seasons ofthe last three years,'' Lay said. ``The colder weather, resultingin increased natural gas use, was coupled with higher averageprices for gas, which also proved beneficial to earnings.''   In releasing the financial figures, the company restatedearnings for 1987 to reflect adoption of changed accounting rules,reducing 1987's reported first quarter earnings by $3.9 million,reflecting a lower federal income tax benefit due to a tax ratechange relative to depreciation and amortization expenses.</TEXT></DOC>
