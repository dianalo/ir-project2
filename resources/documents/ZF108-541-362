1MB to 2MB EMSmemory, Microsoft Windows-supported graphics adapter, DOS 3.0 or later.andO;Mouse recommended.andP;  Ships with a runtime version of Windows, but the fullversion of Windows 2.11 or higher is recommended.andM;In Short: Word for Windows has all the functions of DOS-based Word and more,in an interface that's simpler to use.andP;  The most innovative of GIU wordprocessors, its macros and templates allow for an unprecedented degree ofautomated document creation.andP;  Its visual design is exceptionally lucid andconvenient.andM;Graphics-based word processing hit maturity when Microsoft Word for Windowsappeared on the scene.andP;  The $495 masterpiece is the first and only programthat brings the full depth and richness of features found in the mostadvanced character-based programs to the GUI world.andP;  In fact, Word forWindows goes beyond merely challenging character-based word processors in agraphics environment; it introduces functions that, until now, were scarcelyimaginable in any application.andP;  Almost all its display of the format at thepoint where you're working.andP;  An optional &quot;ribbon&quot; works the same way to letyou select fonts, point sizes, and text attributes that go beyond thestandard bold and italic to include small caps and continuous, broken, ordouble underlining.andP;  You can, of course, use keyboard shortcuts instead oficons, and for fine-tuning of leading and other advanced formatting, you'llneed to open a somewhat complex sequence of menus.andM;Defining a paragraph style is almost embarrasingly easy.andP;  Merely use theribbon and ruler to format a paragraph, click on the stylename box in theruler (or press Ctrl-S), and enter a new stylename.andP;  You can add refinementsvia menus later.andM;Word for Windows's ribbon and ruler are only two of the elements of thescreen that you can display or conceal.andP;  You can turn on a status bar at thefoot of the screen and a vertical bar at theside that displays the names ofstyles used by each paragraph.andP;  You can add built-in or customized macros toany of Word for Windows's menus, or move standard items from one menu toanother.andP;  You can also switch menus.andP;  An option lets you choose whether todisplay only the format elements that the printer can print or everythingyou've formatted into a document, even if you'll need a better printer toprint them.andP;  Print preview is reasonably fast, and lets you edit margins andgraphic locations, but only shows a reduced image.andP;  For top editting speed,you can switch to draft mode, which uses the Windows system font and showsminimal formatting.andM;FANCY FIELD WORKandM;Word for Windows's most impressive innovation, the one that really takes itbeyond character-based applications, is its use of fields.andP;  These are codesthat you include in a document to tell the program to manipulate text orgraphics, or prompt the user to enter text to make decisions.andM;A primitive example of a field is the code found in most character-basedprograms (and in GUI programs like Ami Professional) that automaticallyinserts the current date or filename into the text.andP;  Word for Windows'sfields move far beyond such Stone Age functions.andP;  They can report the amountof time used in editing a dcument, convert numerals to words, copy text intodictionary-style headers, transfer data via DDE links, and even run a macroor jump to another part of the file when the user clicks on them.andP;  Fields letyou create &quot;master&quot; documents that include separate, shorter documents.andP;  Theyalso combine in ne consistent and efficient syntax all of Word for Window'sfunctions for creating numbered lists, indexes, tables of contents,cross-references, and outlines--although simpler menu shortcuts are almostalways available.andM;By combining the fields with macros you can create documents (and templatesfor building other documents) that are as interactive as a video game and farmore productive.andP;  Templates can include fields, glossaries, and macros.andP;  Wordfor Windows supports macros that will run automatically whenever you create,open, or print a file.andP;  In a corporate setting, this means you can writemacros that guide the user through the whole process of creating or revisinga document.andP;  Macros can alter the menus to match the skill of the user or thecomplexity of the document.andM;To learn all the complexities of the WordBASIC macro language, you'll need a$20 technical reference that's sold in bookstores, but most of its contentsare in a disk file that comes with the program.andP;  A small macro industry hasalready begun to thrive on bulletin boards and on the MSAPP forum onCompuServe.andM;Word for Windows comes with a superb automated tutorial.andP;  Unlike most Windowsapplications, Word for Windows offers online help that actually helps.andP;  Andif you're puzzled by the complex screen, press Shift-F1 to turn on a &quot;helppointer&quot; that you can position over an icon or command to get an instantexplanation.andM;THE DOS WORD DIFFERENCEandM;If you're familiar with the character-based DOS version of Word, word forWindows will take little time to learn.andP;  The two programs share similarstructure and procedures, although they aren't keystroke-compatible and Wordfor Windows lacks the two-letter Alt-key style commands familiar in DOS Word.andO;Word for Windows goes one better than DOs Word by letting you open ninedocuments at once, but it shares DOS Word's indispensable ability to split awindow and edit two parts of the same file at the same time.andP;  A macroincluded with Word for Windows can even install the DOW Word keystrokes.andM;Word for Windows uses DOS Wordlike glossaries for text and graphics, and addsa special glossary entry called the Spike that, unlike the Windows clipboard,lets you accumulate bits of text and graphics and insert them in your file atone time.andP;  Word for Windows improves on DOS Word's already excellentoutlining by letting you manipulate collapsible outlines with the mouse oricons in addition to keystrokes.andP;  Word for Windows' speller, however, is evenweaker than the mediocre one in DOS Word, but the thesaurus provides simpledefinitions that can help you refine meanings while you write.andM;Some crucial features of DOS Word are absent in Word for Windows.andP;  TheWindows version lacks division styles and character styles.andP;  This means, forexample, that you can't use Word's fields to create dictionary-style headersfor the pages of a real dictionary.andP;  Word's dictionary-style headers pick upthe first or last text on the page that's formatted with a specific style,but you can use styles only to format full paragraphs, not the boldfacekeyword of a dictionary entry.andP;  Microsoft is committed to adding characterand division styles to Word for Windows, but you should prepare for a longwait.andM;Word for Windows's DOS Word ancestry produces benefits not found in other GUIword processors.andP;  To maintain consistency with DOS Word, Microsoft broke someof the least sensible rules of its own Windows environment.andP;  In most Windowsapplications, if you define (or select) a block and then touch the Spacebar,the block disappears, because the rule in Windows is to replace the selectionwith the character typed at the keyboard.andP;  In Word, the same sequence ofkeystrokes sensibly adds a space (although you can choose the Windowsconvention if you prefer).andM;Similarly, in most Windows applications you can extend a defined block (orselection) only by holding down the shift key and using the mouse ordirection keys.andP;  This normally makes it impossible to extend the blocks bysearching for a string, because you would end up entering only capitalletters in the search menu.andP;  In Word for Windows you can extend the selectionwith the same freedowm you have when editing.andM;Word for Windows isn't trammeled by some of Windows's usuall limitations.andP;  Ittends to be notably faster than any comparably ambitious Windows application,and was the clear winner in virtually all of PC Labs' timing tests.andP;  Topspeed in the Windows environment, however, doesn't mean fast enough.andP;  Even ona 33-MHz machine, some of Word for Windows's operatons, especially with filesusing complex formats, are slow enough to send you back to a character-basedprogram.andP;  Windows 3.0 (with which Word for Windows is already compatible)will knock down some of the walls that slow the word processor to a crawl,but not enough of them.andM;More than most Windows's applications, Word for Windows is designed as muchfor the keyboard as the mouse.andP;  The keyboard template is crowded withconvniences, including a nifty one that lets you glide a paragraph aroundyour text by pressing Shift-Alt-Up or -Down.andP;  You can even turn off thescroll bars to move through your file using the direction keys.andM;Among the dozens of other well-implemented features in Word for Windows arerevision tracking, file comparison, sorting, programmable merges, tables withcomplex formulas, math operations in text, and equation editing.andP;  Instead ofautomatic timed backups you can tell the program to make periodic offers toback up a document.andP;  You can import and resize major graphic formats, but youdon't get the drawing and charting tools that Ami Professional gives you.andO;You insert lines via paragraph formatting, and you can create boxes thatexpand as text flows into them.andP;  Word for Windows imorts most major wordprocessor and spreadhseet formats, but surprisingly, it doesn't automaticallystrip carriage returns from the end of each line in an ASCII file.andP;  You haveto write a macro to do the job for you.andM;One major inconvenience is that you have to write macros to do many thingsthat you should be able to do from menus.andP;  If you want Wordfor Windows's filemenu to display the same directory every time you open the program, you haveto write an autoexec macro to do the job.andP;  This is too much to ask of noviceusers.andM;Word for Windows also has some limits in its control over printing,especially compared to WordPerfect.andP;  Letter spacing can be expanded orcompressed in a defined block or a style, but you make the adjustment bypoints.andP;  You can only compress the space between pairs of letters by 1.75points.andP;  You can't create separate settings for word spacing and letterspacing.andP;  Word for Windows does nothing to overcome the limited number ofcharacters you can print from Windows, although an ingenious but slow macrolets you enter standard symbols.andP;  In print preview, you can't jump to thelast page of a file--you must scroll through every page.andM;The only serious bugs I encountered in Word for Windows were those thataffected printing and DDE links.andP;  With some printers, the em dash overlappedthe following character.andP;  With boxed text on a LaserJet II, some words brokeinto two lines although they displayed as one line in print preview and everyother view.andP;  As for its direct DDE links to Microsoft Excel, imported numbersare rounded to the nearest whole numbers are rounded to the nearest wholenumber, which means that those between 0 and 1 will appear in Word only as 0or 1.andP;  This bug doesn't affect cut-and-paste transfers.andM;These are trivial problems compared with the complexity of the program, andthe first release of Word for Windows is probably the most bug-free of anymajor application in recent years.andP;  Few programs are powerful, intuitive, andreliable.andP;  Word for Windows is all this and more.andM;John Dickinson is executive editor of west coast operations at PC Magazine.andO;Edward Mendelson is a contributing editor of PC Magazine.andP;  Abe Rosner is aproject leader at PC Labs.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
