Five of the defendants were involved in the slayings thatprosecutors claimed were carried out in connection with other crimescommitted by associates of the Gambino family.   The crimes included narcotics trafficking, pornography, autotheft, loan sharking and extortion.   Among those slain were witnesses and intermediaries for Floridadrug dealers. Some victims were dismembered and put in garbage bags.   A defense attorney, Benjamin Brafman, said there would be anappeal.   He said the verdict showed the ``patent unfairness'' of amultidefendant trial, which took 17 months and was one of thelongest federal criminal trials ever.   ``If you put enough defendants in a room and enough criminalcharges in an indictment and if the trial takes long enough, thejurors will feel an obligation to convict in light of the enormoustime and expenditure of the government,'' he said.   After the verdict, U.S. District Judge Vincent L. Broderickimmediately revoked the bail of all but one defendant.   ``These defendants were the most vicious and violent members andassociates of organized crime that have ever been brought totrial,'' Romano said. ``New Yorkers can feel a little safer todayand the mob, I think, considerably weaker.''   Prosecutors said the crew, which operated out of an apartment inBrooklyn, was headed by Roy DeMeo, who was killed by gang members ina power struggle in 1983.   Jurors, who heard 207 witnesses, appeared grim and tired as theforeman read back guilty verdicts on all 17 counts.   They had deliberated 12 days.   The numerous murder allegations were part of racketeering andconspiracy charges against Anthony Senter, 34, Ronald Ustica, 44,Joseph Testa, 34, Salvatore Mangialino, 52, and Douglas Rega, 39.   Other defendants convicted of racketeering in counts that did notinclude murder allegations were Sol Hellman, 63, and Carlo Profeta,46. Hellman was allowed to remain free on bail.   Testa and Senter, who were convicted of conspiring to murder awitness against the stolen car operation, face possible lifesentences. The other defendants could receive prison terms of 20years.   Broderick scheduled sentencing for Sept. 13.   The case, which dates from a 1984 indictment, is one of the lastin a series of widely publicized, mob-related prosecutions broughtby then-U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani.   The original 78-count indictment charged that Paul Castellanoheaded a racketeering enterprise, the Gambino family.   U.S. District Judge Kevin T. Duffy, who originally had the case,broke it up in 1985, with the first trial focusing on a car-theftring that allegedly stole hundreds of cars in New York.   Before the conclusion of that case, Castellano was slain outsidea restaurant. Eventually six of eight defendants in that trial wereconvicted of various charges.</TEXT></DOC>
