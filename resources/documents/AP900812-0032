I guess I have a perversepersonality. ... I've really enjoyed the last few weeks.''   Trump says he's not upset at being dropped from Forbesmagazine's list of the world's richest men and blames it on arun-in he had with the magazine's late owner, Malcolm Forbes. Themagazine, which last put Trump's net worth at $1.7 billion, loweredthat estimate to $500 million in April.   ``(I've) been expecting this attack from Forbes,'' he said.``You know why? Malcolm Forbes got thrown out of the Plaza by me!... You'll read about it in my new book. And I didn't throw him outbecause he didn't pay his bill.''   Trump also said he is more popular than ever despite the badpress he's been getting about his marital woes and cash problems.   And that popularity has rubbed off on the two women most oftenlinked with him: his estranged wife, Ivana, and his allegedmistress, Marla Maples.   ``I've made a lot of satellites ... whether it's Marla orIvana,'' Trump said. ``Marla can do any movie she wants to now.Ivana can do whatever she wants.''</TEXT><DATELINE>DEKALB, Ill.
