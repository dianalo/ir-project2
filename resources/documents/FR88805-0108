Scientists are encouraged to collaborate in developing new interdisciplinaryproposals and to seek complementary funds from other sources. Proposedresearch and projects, such as symposia, workshops or other activitieswhich further the MAB objectives, may be spread over several years. Proposed ideas must first be submitted as a two- to three-page prospectusto be reviewed for its responsiveness to this Request by one or more U.S.MAB Directorates. U.S. MAB Directorate endorsed prospectuses will be reviewedby the U.S. National Committee. The National Committee will then identifywhich projects should be submitted as full proposals for U.S. MAB's peerreview process. Priority will be given to projects requesting $50,000 or less when endorsedby a single Directorate, or a maximum of $100,000 for a project endorsedby two or more Directorates. U.S. MAB will not pay overhead fees on grantsof $50,000 or less. <ITAG tagnum="85">Criteria for Research Themes, Target Areas and Policy Relevance </ITAG>The U.S. National Committee seeks proposals for research and projects onone or more of the following MAB orientations: 1. Ecosystems functioning under different intensities of human impact.2. Management and restoration of human-impacted resources. 3. Human investment and resource use. 4. Human response to environmental stress. It is recommended that all scientists who intend to participate reviewthe <T3>Final Report of the General Scientific Advisory Panel, </T3>MAB ReportSeries No. 59, before commencing work on proposals. This report is availablefrom the U.S. MAB Secretariat. Preference will be given to proposals which concentrate on one or moreof the following target areas: andbullet; Biosphere reserves. andbullet; Biological diversity. andbullet; Global climate and ecological change. andbullet; The biomes or ecotones of the arctic, arid lands or tropics. andbullet; Sustainable/integrated development. Preferably, projects would examine at least one of the four themes in atleast one of the above target areas, and deal with policy issues relevantto U.S. MAB supporting agencies. <ITAG tagnum="84">Format, Application and Processing Procedures </ITAG>Prospectuses may not exceed three pages and must be accompanied by a summarytwo-page biographic sketch of the potential principal(s) that includesexceptional qualifications and a list of relevant publications. Early submissionduring August, September, or October is encouraged. Mail prospectuses tothe U.S. MAB Secretariat, OES/ENR/MAB, U.S. Department of State, Washington,DC 20520. No prospectuses will be accepted after November 1, 1988.

The U.S. MAB Secretariat will distribute prospectuses to the appropriateU.S. MAB Directorates.\1\<NOTE/> Directorates will review prospectuses for endorsement basedon the prospectuses' responsiveness to this call, relevancy to the U.S.MAB Program and the performance competence of the proposed principal(s)as evidenced by the summary biographic sketch. Directorates will reviewall prospectuses by December 1, 1988. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\<T3>Active U.S. MAB Directorates:</T3><ITAG tagnum="28">MAB-1 Tropical Forests </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">MAB-2 Temperate Forests </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">MAB-3 Grazing Lands </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">MAB-4 Arid/Semiarid Lands </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">MAB-5 Fresh Water Resources </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">MAB-6 Arctic Ecosystems </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">MAB-7 Island Ecosystems (Caribbean) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">MAB-8 Biosphere Reserves </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">MAB-11 Urban Ecosystems </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">MAB-13 Human Issues andamp; Environmental Change </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">MAB-14 Pollution </ITAG>Prospectuses endorsed by a Directorate, or Directorates, will be forwardedto the U.S. National Committee for MAB for review. At its January 6, 1989meeting, the National Committee will further review all prospectuses fortheir relevance to the U.S. MAB Program priorities and to the policiesof U.S. MAB's supporting agencies. The National Committee will then determinewhich potential principal(s) may submit a full proposal. Full project and research proposals must be received in the U.S. MAB Secretariatby close of business, May 1, 1989. Proposal texts must not exceed 30 double-spacedpages, excluding a concise two-page executive summary describing the objectiveof the proposed effort and the method of approach, accompanying bibliographiesand curriculum vitae of the principals. An executive summary must clearlyestablish that the proposed activities are relevant to at least one ofthe four MAB orientations, one of the target areas, and the policy concernsof the relevant U.S. MAB supporting agency(ies). Each proposal must containa letter of endorsement from a U.S. MAB supporting agency.\2\<NOTE/> All proposals must contain: (1) Clearly defined objectives;(2) a feasible work plan to achieve those objectives within the time frameand resources of the grant; and (3) specified products which will resultfrom the grant.

Directorates and reviewers will also assessa proposal's potential to increase scientific understanding and providethe basis for policy development by U.S. MAB's supporting agencies. Directoratesand peer reviewers will consider, in their overall assessments of the proposals,the performance competence of the principals and the adequacy of the proposedresources to accomplish the objectives. A final ranking of the proposals will be made by the U.S. National Committeefor the Man and the Biosphere Program based on all of the above factorsand their assessment of the proposals' relevancy to U.S. MAB's supportingagencies. Proposals will then be funded in order of their assigned rankaccording to available funds. Principals will receive copies of all peer review evaluations made of theirporposals and written notification of the Committee's decisions on theirprojects. Winning proposals become part of the public domain. Proposalsnot selected by the National Committee for funding will then be returnedto the authors. The National Committee will notify all principals of its final decisionsin July 1989. Funds will be committed to the managing institutions identifiedin the selected proposals by September 30, 1989. <ITAG tagnum="6">Roger E.
