Despite widespread predictions that free-market forces would one day force major banks into an all-out rate battle for card holders, issuers have long hung on to a fragile truce -- and charged interest rates averaging about 17.8%, far above the cost of other forms of credit. Consumers have basically gone along: One recent study concluded that a quarter of the nation's 82 million card holders didn't know how much interest they were paying.    But the truce is in serious jeopardy: American Express Co. has launched a new revolving charge card, called Optima, that will undercut most Visas and MasterCards by initially offering a comparatively low 13.5% rate on outstanding balances. Distressed, Visa USA Inc. urged some of its bank clients to stop selling American Express traveler's checks.    The American Express foray comes at a critical time. Yesterday, the House Banking Subcommittee on Consumer Affairs approved a bill calling for better disclosure of credit-card terms and limiting interest rates to eight percentage points above the return on one-year Treasury bills; based on that formula, the credit-card rate ceiling would be about 13.8%. Proponents of such legislation say American Express has aided their cause. Optima &quot;is our first major break,&quot; says Rep. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat who has frequently criticized card rates.    Banks still defend the steep rates, citing the expense of administering millions of card transactions a week, but their ability to hold the line is being eroded by a number of forces. The 1986 tax law will gradually eliminate the deductibility of credit-card interest payments, and the boom in home-equity loans, which remain deductible in many cases, could force card issuers to chase harder after customers. Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co.'s Discover card, started in 1985, has sparked other retailers' interest in challenging banks for credit-card business. And some states are threatening to impose interest-rate ceilings.    Although few banking experts expect rates to fall much right away, many say the tide has turned against banks trying to cling to their high charges. At the very least, they believe that well-heeled consumers with good credit will soon benefit substantially from lower rates targeted specifically at them. And changing consumer attitudes, spurred by a groundswell of consumer activism, may prod banks into much broader concessions.    &quot;The jig may be up for a lot of bankers who want to keep rates as high as they are now,&quot; says Gary Burton, who heads credit-card operations for Liberty National Bank andamp; Trust, Oklahoma's biggest card issuer. &quot;Competition is catching up with us.&quot;    Hustling for consumers is a game that banks would rather avoid -- especially now. For years, credit cards have been one of their main profit centers, helping offset damage from bad loans and competitive incursions by other lenders.    Banks say the high cost of administering credit-card loans largely explains why most card rates have dropped only slightly from their 1982 peaks despite a 14-percentage-point decline in the prime rate, the basic lending rate to businesses. Card issuers also want the higher rates to help absorb losses from sometimes-sloppy card underwriting. American Express itself has had its problems; for example, it issued a credit card to Shamoo the cat, the house pet of two Floridians who allegedly used the card and other American Express cards to bilk the financial-services giant out of $80,000.    Even a modest rate war could cost banks dearly. Charles Russell, Visa USA's president, estimates that even if American Express gets only a quarter of the 10 million holders of upscale premium cards to throw out their bank cards in favor of Optima, the banks would lose $1 billion in interest income and $125 million in fees. In a full-scale rate war, the lost profits would be far higher.    So far, banks have been able to build their card portfolios without much price competition by focusing on marketing gimmicks. For example, Citibank offers Citidollars, glorified Green Stamps that can be traded for briefcases, watches and other items. Sears uses a similar &quot;bonus point&quot; system to push its Discover card. Preapproved credit lines, low-cost insurance and other frills have been thrown in routinely over the years. First Deposit National Bank, of Tilton, N.H., has been soliciting customers with a mailing that pitches a $5,000 line of credit, an immediate cash loan to pay off other cards and a speedy approval process. In fine print, the interest rate is revealed: 21.9%.    Most consumers haven't been very bothered by the rates they are charged. For one thing, many card users pay their bills promptly and thus don't incur any interest charges anyway. And even people who do borrow on their cards have tended to focus on things such as the size of their monthly payments. A study by Bank Credit Card Observer, an industry newsletter, says that 25% of card holders don't know their card rates and that 60% believe that most banks charge about the same rates. &quot;I have no idea how much my interest rate is,&quot; says Suzanne Carver, a Chicago housewife, as she paws through her purse to check her card. &quot;It doesn't say on here. Well, as long as I can buy things with it, who cares?&quot;    Banks that have tried to lure customers with low rates haven't set off any stampedes. When Central Bank, of Walnut Creek, Calif., tried to lure new business last summer by paring its rate to 17.76% -- more than three percentage points below the California average -- consumers yawned. &quot;In four months, we spent $250,000 for advertising and increased our accounts from 24,000 to 26,000,&quot; says Dennis Buesse, a senior vice president. &quot;People just didn't care.&quot; The $1.2 billion bank wound up selling its portfolio and dumping its card business altogether.    Leo Shapiro, a Chicago market researcher, says the psychological salve that consumers get from owning a card can distract them from worrying about rates or looking for bargain cards. &quot;The great modern nightmare is discovering that you're unrecognized, a nobody,&quot; Mr. Shapiro says. &quot;With that card, you can be surrounded by strangers, but you walk up and say, 'Look what I've got in my hand.' Suddenly, you're a person of importance.&quot;    But attitudes may be changing. Consumer Action, an activist group based in San Francisco, says that so far this year it has received 9,000 requests for its list of banks with comparatively low rates -- more than in all 1986. It attributes the upsurge to the increased political clamor over high rates and the tax-law change.    Optima may well encourage consumers to get even pickier about credit-card rates. American Express says it decided to start the card because three years of research showed that revolving credit from other sources was used by almost two-thirds of its card holders, who normally are expected to pay the full amount due on their regular American Express cards every month. But its research also showed that many card holders would switch to a new card only if offered sharp reductions of four to six percentage points. A two-point reduction drew little interest in tests.    The card will be promoted to an estimated eight million to nine million American Express card holders, according to Rodney Schwartz, a securities analyst who follows American Express for PaineWebber Inc. American Express expects two million to three million of them to sign on over the next two to three years -- even though the new card will be somewhat more costly than its tantalizing rate would seem to suggest. Holders of the card will pay a $15 annual fee -- about mid-range of what most card issuers charge. Moreover, the interest rate could rise because it is pegged to the prime rate.    Most of the biggest bank-card issuers generally play down the American Express move and the clamor for lower rates. Citicorp, the biggest bank-card issuer, with over nine million accounts, declines comment. However, Charles R. Walsh, an executive vice president at Manufacturers Hanover Corp., which has 3.3 million accounts, says, &quot;We have been and will continue to compete effectively.&quot; And a spokesman for First Chicago Corp., which will become the third-largest bank issuer of cards when it completes an acquisition later this year, says: &quot;Those who feel the major issuers charge too much simply don't understand the business.&quot;    One reason Optima could reshape the credit-card business is that American Express is the first high-profile card issuer with national marketing muscle to introduce a low-rate card. Beyond that, its foray into revolving credit -- in which the card holder must make only a minimal payment each month -- further blurs the once-well-defined line between banks and other financial-service companies. In the case of credit cards, the barriers have muted rate competition because few banks wanted to risk provoking a price war.    &quot;American Express is the 500-pound gorilla that consumers have been waiting for,&quot; says Elgie Holstein, the director of Bankcard Holders of America, a Washington-based consumer group. The company, he adds, &quot;has the coast-to-coast marketing muscle to go head-to-head with Visa and MasterCard and make interest rates an issue.&quot; Some bankers also believe that banks that have considered lower rates may now try to jump on the bandwagon.    The first spoils probably will go to upscale consumers with solid credit records. Already, signs of a two-tiered approach are cropping up. Citicorp, for example, recently cut rates for its &quot;preferred&quot; customers to 16.8%. The rate for everyone else: 19.8%.    &quot;Rates will come down in dribs and drabs, and you'll see it mainly on the preferred side,&quot; says James McDermott, a banking analyst at Keefe Bruyette andamp; Woods Inc.    But the mass market is showing signs of agitation as well. &quot;It's just real distressing to know you're being gouged,&quot; says Andy Denemark, a programming director for NBC Radio Entertainment in New York. He is hoping to replace his 19.8% card with a cheaper one from a bank in Arkansas or Connecticut. Ronald Albers, a warehouse supervisor in Dallas, says he has essentially stopped using his credit cards, one of which carries a 22% rate. &quot;That's just a rip-off,&quot; he declares.    The tax-law change that phases out credit-card deductions makes the high rates even more painful, but the impact of the change will be softened by its gradual introduction. The curb on the deduction will be phased in over five years, with 35% of such deductions disallowed in 1987, 60% in 1988, 80% in 1989, 90% in 1990 and 100% in 1991. Moreover, not all credit-card borrowers will be affected; Internal Revenue Service data indicate that only 38% of taxpayers itemized deductions on their 1984 returns. On the other hand, itemizers tend to be heavy borrowers; in 1984, they claimed $53.9 billion in interest deductions on loans other than mortgages.    Meanwhile, the booming market in home-equity loans and other new credit plans gives consumers seeking relief plenty of options. Bruce Bretland, a real-estate broker in Evanston, Ill., says that partly because of the tax law, he has been leaving his credit cards in his wallet and paying cash. &quot;The saying this past Christmas was to go plastic-free. I think a lot of people have been cutting back,&quot; he says.    Home-equity loans pose a particular menace to the credit-card business, financial managers say. The loans -- revolving credit secured by a homeowner's equity -- often carry interest rates as low as 7.5%, and much of the interest is still deductible. The market for such loans is expected to mushroom from about $50 billion now to some $300 billion by 1990, and that growth may come largely at the expense of high-priced plastic. Moreover, two weeks ago, State Street Bank andamp; Trust Co., of Boston, unveiled what amounts to a home-equity credit card -- a 12.5% card collateralized by a customer's home.    &quot;Many consumers are using equity lines to consolidate their credit cards or to shorten payment periods,&quot; says Randall Sanada, a financial planner in Chatsworth, Calif. &quot;Banks will have to drop rates to compete.&quot;    Competitive pressure is also coming from thrifts. Latecomers in the game, savings and loan associations had puffed up their credit-card loans to $6.5 billion by last Sept. 30, the latest figure available; that was nearly triple the level two years earlier. Thrifts such as Chevy Chase Savings Bank in Chevy Chase, Md., are offering rates as low as 14%.    Some smaller banks also are luring customers with rock-bottom rates. Simmons First National Bank, of Pine Bluff, Ark., barred by state law from charging more than five percentage points above the Fed's discount rate, charges only 10.5% interest but still turns a profit. It does so by being highly selective about whom it issues cards to, by funding the business with cheap local deposits and by taking advantage of its low overhead. Its card loans have grown more than 30% in the past year to $58 million, with about 60% of the new accounts coming from out of state, says Thomas Paxton, a vice president.    All told, banks held about $91.9 billion in credit-card loans at year-end. First Chicago derived about 30% of its $272.2 million 1986 profit from consumer loans, mostly credit cards. But although profits have been good, delinquency rates and writeoffs have reached record levels, in many cases far outstripping banks' expectations. For banks with more than $300 million of assets, credit-card charge-offs hit a record $2.5 billion last year, up 56% from 1985.    The most immediate threat to banks' current card practices, however, may come from angry government officials. In addition to the action in Congress yesterday, officials in California, Iowa and Tennessee and elsewhere have called for state laws curbing rates. The treasurer of Illinois tried to punish First Chicago for its high credit-card rates by withdrawing state deposits from the bank.    Meanwhile, some consumers are fighting back on their own. James K. McEldowney, a Beverly Hills, Calif., real-estate man who carries 53 credit cards, says he has had enough of West Coast banks charging 21%; he got a 10% card from an Arkansas bank. Of his other cards, he says: &quot;One of these days, I'm going to decorate my wall with them.&quot;    ---       The Credit-Card Game: Big Players and Low Rates                     NUMBER    INTEREST   ANNUAL    INTEREST BANK           OF ACCOUNTS        RATE*     FEE*  FREE DAYS The biggest bank players Citibank         9,000,000       19.8%      $20        30# Bank of America  7,000,000       19.8        18        25# Chase Manhattan  4,186,000       17.5        20        30# First National Bank of Chicago  3,100,000       19.8        20        25# Manufacturers Hanover          3,000,000       17.8        20        25# Wells Fargo**    2,133,000       20.0        18        25# Marine Midland   1,880,000       19.8        15        30# Chemical Bank    1,540,000       19.5        20        25# Banc One         1,365,000       19.8        20        25# Maryland Bank    1,239,000       17.9        18        30# The cheapest bank cards Simmons First National          160,000        10.5%***   $22.50     25# People's             N.A.        11.50       20.00     25@ Manufacturers National             N.A.        13.30***     0.00      0@@ First National Bank of Cincinnati   N.A         13.50***    20.00     25# Republic National 25,000         14.00***    22.00     30# Union National       N.A.        14.20***    20.00      0@ Marine Midland 2,200,000         14.59***    25.00     30@ Manufacturers andamp; Traders          6,000         14.75***    25.00     30# Connecticut Bank andamp; Trust        N.A.         15.00       25.00     25# Rainier National         500,000         15.00***    18.00     25#   *For basic accounts during the week of March 1   **Includes accounts of Crocker National Bank   ***Variable rate   #From date of billing   @Interest charged from date of posting   @@Interest charged from date of purchase   N.A. = not available   Sources: American Banker; Bank Credit Card Observer</TEXT></DOC>
