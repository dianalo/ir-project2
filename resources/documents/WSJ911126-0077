Partisan differences between the Republican administrationand the Democratic-controlled Congress were at the center ofdisputes over anti-crime and education measures yesterday,with each side accusing the other of manipulating the issuesfor political gain.</LP><TEXT>   At the same time, the president worked to put out abrushfire in his own party over tax cuts aimed at stimulatingeconomic growth. Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the secondranking Republican in the House, met with Mr. Bush at theWhite House to plead for a major tax cut plan this year. Butwhile giving Republicans the go-ahead to push for a symbolicshowdown with Democrats on the issue today, Mr. Bushindicated that he preferred to see Congress wait until nextyear before enacting such legislation.   The fighting comes amid a backdrop of anxiety among bothBush officials and lawmakers that inaction on criticaldomestic problems will exact a political toll in theelections next fall.   A new NBC News poll suggests that domestic problems aretaking a serious political toll on the president. The poll,conducted last Wednesday and Thursday by pollster Peter Hart,found that 51% of the 728 registered voters surveyed nowapprove of Mr. Bush's job performance, while 39% disapprove.That is the lowest mark of his presidency; only last month, aWall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that 63% approved ofhis job as president while 30% disapproved.   A crime bill is one of two measures that the presidentinsisted Congress should pass this year, but a measure pushedby Democrats was in jeopardy yesterday after Mr. Bush said hewould veto it because it is too soft on crime. The Democratscountered that the president doesn't care about the bill'sprovisions, but rather wants to play the crime issue againstthem for his own political benefit.   Chairman Joseph Biden (D., Del.) of the Senate JudiciaryCommittee suggested that the president threatened to veto thelegislation in order to placate the powerful National RifleAssociation, which opposes a provision that would impose awaiting period on people seeking to purchase handguns.   In a speech delivered early yesterday in Columbus, Ohio,Mr. Bush urged enactment of his education proposals. &quot;Thisisn't a liberal-versus-conservative fight,&quot; he said. &quot;It's arevolution against business as usual. The American peoplewant education that works.&quot;   Back in Washington, Senate Minority Leader Robert Doleblocked an education bill from being debated because he saidit contained virtually none of Mr. Bush's proposals. Thebill, which Democrats sought to bring to the Senate floorbill, would authorize $850 million in grants for local schoolimprovements.   The Bush administration strongly opposes the legislationbecause it wouldn't allow federal spending on &quot;educationalchoice&quot; systems that allow parents to send their children toprivate or parochial schools, a cornerstone of thePresident's education plan. The measure also would awardmoney to schools in thousands of local districts to spend onimprovements as they see fit, rather than providing grants tofund experimental schools in each congressional district.   The $3.2 billion crime bill, which the administrationdenounced as too mild, would impose a waiting period of fiveworking days on hand-gun purchases to check prospectivebuyers for criminal records; apply the death penalty to morethan 50 federal crimes; give law enforcement officers greaterlatitude to use evidence obtained using invalid warrants;limit the right of state prisoners on death row to fileappeals called &quot;habeas corpus&quot; petitions to federal court;create a kind of Reserve Officers Training Corps program, inwhich up to 20,000 students would receive help financingtheir college educations in return for serving on localpolice forces; authorize about $3 billion to bolster hiringof law-enforcement officers and for other anti-crimeinitiatives.   Rep. Gingrich met with the president to make a pitch onbehalf of his fellow House Republicans that a major tax-cutbill should be advanced this year to boost the laggingeconomy. He said he plans to press the issue in the Housetoday.   Mr. Bush told Mr. Gingrich that he could say publicly thatthe president is &quot;enthusiastic&quot; about such an idea. &quot;If itwere possible to get everything he wanted, obviously he'dlike to have it,&quot; said House Minority Leader Robert Michel(R., Ill.), who attended the meeting. But White Housespokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Mr. Bush isn't inclined toask Congress to remain in session through Thanksgiving toconsider such a measure.   ---   Bruce Ingersoll contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
