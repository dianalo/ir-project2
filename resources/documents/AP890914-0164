State-sponsored anti-Semitism, official policy for hundreds ofyears, has abated, although many cases are still reported, thereport said.   The report is designed to provide information about Soviettreatment of Jews, Armenians and Pentecostals _ the three groupswith the largest number seeking seek to emigrate to the UnitedStates.   Soviet Jews, estimated to number at least 2.5 million, comprisethe largest group of emigres seeking entry into the United Statesunder the open-door policies of President Mikhail Gorbachev.   As many as 150,000 Soviets, the majority Jews, are expected toapply to leave for the United States next year.   But while the government is allowing increased Jewish emigrationand limiting harassment of religious and cultural activities,``widespread anti-Semitic discrimination is still encountered at thelower levels of government ... and in the general Russianpopulation,'' the report said.   Leaders of five American Jewish organizations, calling on DeputySecretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, registered concern overanti-semitism in the Soviet Union.   Shoshana S. Cardin, chairman of the National Conference on SovietJewry, said ``it is creating tremendous apprehension.''   ``Concerns are mounting there is a wave of emotion that is beingappealed to that is dangerous,'' Cardin said.   The findings, presented by Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., at ahearing about the administration's proposal to admit 50,000 Sovietrefugees next year, appear to clash with a Justice Departmentdirective that has removed the presumption of persecution for SovietJews.   The directive, issued by former Attorney General Edwin Meese,requires each applicant to prove ``a well-founded fear ofpersecution'' to be granted refugee status.   As many as 50 percent of those applying this year in Moscow havebeen turned down for refugee status. That is despite the fact thatImmigration and Naturalization Service officials use the report tohelp them process Soviet applicants, according to INS chief of staffGerald Coyle.   The new type of Soviet anti-Semitism ``has increased markedly inthe context of glasnost, as prior governmental controls on speech,assembly, media, etc., have been loosened,'' the report said.   Popular groups such as Pamyat ``frequently express anti-Semitismas a social theory to explain'' economic hardships or to opposeGorbachev's reforms, it said.   Many Jews ``have reason to fear not only that the fall ofGorbachev and the reformers allied with him would bring back thekind of official anti-Semitism that was in vogue prior to 1987,''but that it would be augmented by the new brand of discrimination,the report said.   ``Official discrimination against Jews has also continued,'' theState Department said. ``Persons identified as Jews have greatdifficulty being accepted into'' universities and other institutions.   ``And despite some significant efforts to appear to providefacilities for the study of Jewish religion and culture, in factvery little improvement has occurred.''</TEXT></DOC>
