Freedman   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>02/04/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B1</SO><CO>   AHP FORGN BMY ABT Z.NES</CO><IN>FOOD PRODUCTS (FOD)</IN><GV>INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES AND INSTITUTIONS (INT)</GV><LP>   American Home Products Corp. is about to unveil a plan tostop providing free and low-cost infant formula to developingcountries, just days after Nestle S.A. made a similarcommitment. The pledges made by the world's two biggestformula marketers overseas represent a watershed in thebitter infant-feeding controversy.   In recent years, Nestle and American Home Products havebeen under mounting pressure for defying the World HealthOrganization's guidelines by dumping large quantities of freeand low-cost formula on Third World hospitals. Action forCorporate Accountability, a Minneapolis-based advocacy group,launched a world-wide boycott against both companies in 1988,charging them with using &quot;dangerous and, in some cases,illegal methods&quot; to sell formula. The boycott remains ineffect.</LP><TEXT>   The companies continue to say they have been in fullcompliance with the WHO code, which restricts free suppliesexcept to children &quot;in need.&quot; But that has been left to theinterpretation of hospital administrators, and infant formulamakers typically supply free and low-cost products on arequest basis.   Now, even long-standing critics agree that the two infantformula makers' separate -- but not coincidental -- vows marka reversal in the industry's position. &quot;This is a new era inthat for the first time companies are saying, `Yes,' freesupplies interfere with the initiation of breast-feeding,&quot;said a Unicef official.   Critics object to the practice of encouraging new mothersin poor countries to give up breast-feeding by distributingfree formula through hospitals. Outside hospitals, the watersupply and other conditions may not be sanitary and mothersmay not understand usage directions. Improper use of infantformula can lead to malnutrition, diarrhea andgastroenteritis.   The apparent willingness of American Home Products to jumpon the bandwagon also increases the odds that changes inThird World marketing practices finally will happen. In thepast, Nestle had insisted it couldn't discontinue freesupplies on its own, because other companies would simplysteal its market share. But the capitulation of American HomeProducts, an especially aggressive rival, makes that argumentfar harder to sustain. And other U.S. competitors includingBristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Abbott Laboratories Inc. areexpected soon to follow suit. Neither company would commenton its plans.   &quot;In the past, everyone in the industry maintained a unitedfront, arguing the same case and defending free supplies,&quot;said Tim Smith, executive director of the Interfaith Centeron Corporate Responsibility in New York. &quot;Now that Nestle hasbroken the logjam, there will be a domino effect among othercompanies.&quot;   American Home Products is expected to take an evenstronger stand than Nestle, which last week announced it willattempt to work with government officials in the effort tohalt free and low-cost formula &quot;except for the limitednumbers of infants who need it.&quot;   A final draft of American Home Product's policy, which isnow under review by organizations including Unicef and theWHO, states: &quot;We hereby announce our commitment to work toend all free supplies of infant formula to maternities andhospitals in developing countries.&quot;   Ken Abramowitz, a health-care industry analyst at SanfordC. Bernstein andamp; Co., estimated that American Home Products'Wyeth-Ayerst subsidiary holds about 15% of the $3 billionworld-wide infant formula market. About 75% of the company'sroughly $450 million in infant formula sales comes fromoverseas. Nestle controls more than 40% of the world-widemarket.   An American Home Products spokeswoman said the companyhopes to make &quot;significant progress&quot; within two years bycoordinating with governments, international agencies andrivals. &quot;The world has come to a point where everybodyfollowing this issue feels we are ready to work together,&quot;the spokeswoman said. But she emphasized that, while AmericanHome Products was aware of Nestle's intentions, the companieshadn't undertaken &quot;a joint effort&quot; or made &quot;agreements.&quot;   Nonetheless, some critics doubt the free-formula issuewill evaporate, despite the industry's sudden zeal. They saythat Nestle promised to halt free supplies in 1984 as acondition of ending a boycott. Douglas Johnson, chairman ofAction, the advocacy group, contended that American HomeProducts is hustling because &quot;it has evaluated that thereisn't much in the Nestle position other than strong publicrelations.&quot; He asserted that Action's monitoring of marketingpractices in the Third World shows that &quot;American HomeProducts is by all accounts the worst in the field&quot; in termsof aggressive use of free supplies. The company's spokeswomantermed the charges scurrilous and untrue, adding thatAmerican Home Products has had &quot;the most cordial ofreceptions with church groups and UNICEF.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
