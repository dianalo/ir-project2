The official, whose identity was shielded under briefing rulesat the State Department, referred to the Intermediate-range NuclearForces treaty to scrap about 2,700 U.S. and Soviet nuclear missiles.   It was signed by President Reagan and General Secretary MikhailS. Gorbachev in December and is before the Senate for ratification.   In the meantime, Secretary of State George P. Shultz will holdtalks in Moscow next Sunday and Monday on preparations for theirnext summit meeting. It is to be held in Moscow, possibly in lateMay or early June.   The centerpiece of that fourth and final meeting between the twoleaders is supposed to be a more ambitious treaty to reduce by 30percent to 50 percent the overall U.S. and Soviet arsenals oflong-range bombers, land-based missiles and submarines.   But the official said negotiations in Geneva had slowed down forseveral reasons. The Soviets are trying to restrict Reagan'sStrategic Defense Initiative, the program to develop a space-basedshield against ballistic missiles, and the United States isresisting various restrictions on cruise missiles.   Shultz will meet on Sunday with Foreign Minister Eduard A.Shevardnadze and on Monday with Gorbachev and Shevardnadze. He isdue to fly to Brussels on Tuesday to brief the North AtlanticTreaty Organization allies on the results.   Meanwhile, Charles E. Redman, the State Department spokesman,announced Shultz also will meet with Andrei D. Sakharov, the notedSoviet dissident, while he is in Moscow.   ``Human rights is high on his agenda,'' Redman said Wednesday.``Mr. Sakharov obviously is a person well-placed to talk aboutthese kind of issues.''   Assistant Secretary of State Rozanne L. Ridgway, in a U.S.government telecast to Western Europe, said human rights has``pride of place'' in Shultz' plans.   Other key items are the slowed-down negotations in Geneva toproduce a new arms control agreement, the prospective withdrawal of120,000 Soviet troops from Afghanistan and U.S. efforts to arrangeArab-Israeli negotiations.   Sakharov, winner of the Nobel peace prize in 1975, is aphysicist who helped develop the Soviet hydrogen bomb in the 1950s.His subsequent outspoken support for human rights and opposition tothe Afghanistan invasion led to his banishment to the closed cityof Gorky in 1980.   He remained there until 1986, when he was permitted to return toMoscow amid Gorbachev's liberalization policy.</TEXT></DOC>
