These materials are of interestnot only because of their potential ionic conductivities, but also becausesome of them may have electronic conductivity and oxidizing power whichwould be useful for novel electrode materials in all-solid-state batteries.Two broad classes of materials were investigated: PEO solutions of Zn(II),Cd(II), and Pb(II), all of which are potential electrolytes for solid-statebatteries, and PEO solutions of transition metal salts, which are ofinterest as possible cathode materials. Mixed compositions containingboth divalent cations and lithium ions were also prepared. Electrolytesformed with small, highly-polarizing ions, such as Mg(II) and Ca(II),are essentially pure anion conductors. Electrolytes containing Zn(II)behave similarly, unless they are hydrated, in which case the Zn(II)ions are quite mobile. Electrolytes formed with larger, more polarizablecations, such as Pb(II) and Cd(II), conduct both anions and cations.Solutions of salts of transition metal cations form a third group ofelectrolytes. Of the electrolytes investigated so far, those formed withNi(II) salts are the most unusual. It appears as if the transport numberof Ni{sup ++} and the electrolyte conductivity can be greatly enhancedby controlling the hydration and dehydration of the polymer. 10 refs.,9 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
