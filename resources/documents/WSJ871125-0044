December-delivery copper rose 4.90 cents a pound to $1.113 after rising to as high as $1.12. The March contract advanced 3.40 cents to $1.033.    On Monday, the December contract rose slightly and appeared to be overshadowed by the March contract, which was seen as reflecting tight copper supplies at least into the first quarter of 1988.    &quot;There's too little copper in Commodity Exchange warehouses to meet the open interest in the December contract, and that's causing concern among traders,&quot; said John Gross, president of J.E. Gross andamp; Associates Inc., a metal-industry consultant.    He said the open interest -- or the number of contracts for December delivery that remain to be evened out by delivery of the commodity or by the purchase of an opposite contract -- stood at 10,144 contracts at the opening of trading yesterday. That represents about 126,000 tons of copper. &quot;At the same time, there are only 35,211 tons of copper in Comex warehouses, or about a third of the open interest,&quot; he said.    Apparently traders became more aware of the discrepancy between the December open interest and Comex warehouse stocks. The premium for December over March, which narrowed on Monday, widened yesterday by 1.5 cents to eight cents a pound. The March premium over May, which widened Monday and appeared to be taking precedence over December-March, narrowed by 0.40 cent to 7.10 cents.    Worse, the supply situation shows no sign of softening, industry sources said. Producing-company officials were reluctant to talk about the situation, but, according to sources close to producers, at least two major mining companies are sold out through 1988.    &quot;Demand has been good for three years and supplies simply have been used up,&quot; the source said. &quot;More people are asking for copper than companies can supply.&quot;    Producers sell on yearly contracts, with prices set on a quarterly basis at a premium over Comex prices. Consumers have the option to accept or reject the contracts, but at the moment, &quot;they're grabbing every bit they can get, even if they don't need it,&quot; said the source. &quot;The high price, instead of being a deterrent, is acting as a spur to buy copper.&quot; This overbuying may be contributing somewhat to the sharp price advances and the supply tightness, he said.    In other commodity markets yesterday:    INTEREST RATES: A coordinated round of interest-rate cuts by European central banks buoyed prices of Treasury-bond futures half a world away in Chicago yesterday morning. But the lift wasn't enough to keep futures prices from sinking by mid-afternoon in light trading. Stock-index futures rallied on the rate cuts and a stronger dollar. Treasury-futures prices rose to a high of 90 3/32 shortly after opening on news of the interest-rate cuts, which traders said were a show of support for the U.S. budget-deficit package that was patched together in Washington last week. But rising commodity-futures prices, and estimates of stronger-than-expected U.S. auto sales for mid-November, reined-in the bond-futures rally. Also weighing on the market were comments from Hans Wertz, a senior West German central bank official, that the $30 billion in planned U.S. budget cuts didn't fulfill the U.S. obligation to other industrial countries that signed the so-called Louvre accord in February aimed at stabilizing each other's currencies. December treasury-bond futures closed at 88 21/32, down 29/32. &quot;You can't be confident of a bold move one way or the other in these markets until the new year,&quot; said Charles Christensen, a futures analyst with Refco Group Ltd., Chicago.    PRECIOUS METALS: U.S. gold and silver prices held big gains from the previous two sessions, although &quot;the inability to continue the rally sort of disappointed some investors,&quot; said John Norris, director of precious-metals trading at Citibank, New York. On the Commodity Exchange, the December gold contract closed at $475.40 an ounce, down 60 cents. Silver settled three cents lower, at $6.92 an ounce. January platinum closed at $509 an ounce, down $2.70, after a $6.90 gain Monday. Many investors are still on the sidelines. Nancy Johnston, Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s senior gold trader, said despite inflation fears, some investors are reluctant to buy gold now because &quot;every time they've bought gold from $470 to $490 they've gotten burned.&quot; She said if the $490 barrier is broken &quot;they'll return.&quot;    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Wheat futures prices rose amid news that the Agriculture Department targeted Morocco to receive 1.5 million metric tons of subsidized U.S. wheat, said Ralph Waldron, a grain analyst at Stotler andamp; Co., Chicago. Under a federal program designed to boost grain exports, the U.S. compensates exporters who sell U.S. wheat to certain countries at below world prices. The prices of wheat-futures contracts were also boosted by reports that China is interested in buying 380,000 tons of U.S. wheat. That news follows the decision last week by the Agriculture Department to make China eligible to receive one million tons of subsidized wheat. Soybean-futures prices rose on the buying of some big food concerns, which apparently jumped into the market on Monday's weak prices. Rumors of Soviet orders for soybean and soybean meal continued to dominate the market. Traders are continuing to speculate that the Soviet Union isn't finished with its buying spree, even though no new orders have materialized since Friday.    COTTON: Futures prices rose on a continued increase in industrial cotton consumption. The December contract advanced 1.87 cents a pound to 70.85 cents. The U.S. Census Bureau, in a report released before the opening of trading yesterday, said U.S. mill consumption of cotton during October averaged 31,206 bales daily, compared with 30,115 bales in September and 27,308 bales in October 1986. Also a possible supporting factor, analysts said, was that only 23 notices to deliver cotton against the December contract were issued yesterday. The small number could be viewed constructively, &quot;because it showed a possible reluctance to tender cotton for delivery,&quot; one analyst said. &quot;On Monday, the willingness to accept a huge number, 673 contracts, was a firming factor,&quot; he said.    ENERGY: Oil prices were steady world-wide. U.S. crude futures for December delivery lost seven cents, closing at $18.71 a barrel, in quiet New York trading. After the close, weekly American Petroleum Institute statistics showed a 4.5-million-barrel rise in U.S. crude stockpiles, to 358 million barrels, as well as an increase in imports. </TEXT></DOC>
