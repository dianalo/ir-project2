Six alternative energy sources were first described - windpower, biomass, geothermal energy, solar energy, wave and tidal power.Combined heat and power was also mentioned. General questions concerningalternative energy sources were then considered. In particular, theirpotential contribution to the energy demand was assessed. The evidencepresented to the committee suggested that they would only make a smallcontribution in the near future and could not be considered as a substitutefor coal and nuclear power. However, by the year 2030 it would be possiblefor 18% of the national electricity demand to be met by alternative energysources. The economic and environmental issues were assessed brieflyand the report's conclusions were summarized. An independent review ofwave power was called for in view of conflicting evidence presented tothe committee. The debate which followed lasted three hours and is reportedverbatim. Other issues raised included energy conservation, public attitudesto energy, the environment, government and private funding of researchand development of nuclear power, including fusion.
