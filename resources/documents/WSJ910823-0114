Lenin would have understood. In his great history of the20th century, &quot;Modern Times,&quot; Paul Johnson writes that Leninnever believed in Marxist determinism. He was a&quot;voluntarist,&quot; believing in the decisive role in history ofhuman will (and violence). It's a rich irony that 74 yearslater Lenin's revolution was undone by another voluntarist,Boris Yeltsin, who understood the necessity of forcefulaction better than Lenin's heirs. He acted; they waffled.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Yeltsin understood that the vanguard of history hadchanged sides. Seven decades of &quot;creating facts&quot; had soexhausted communism's moral authority that the State ofEmergency Committee never once mentioned Marxism. It merelypromised &quot;order&quot; and higher wages.   The most revealing line of the coup was uttered by theRussian journalist who asked the Gang of Eight at a pressconference if they had sought &quot;any advice through GeneralPinochet.&quot; Other reporters laughed sarcastically. EvenVladimir Pozner, the one-time Brezhnev apologist, describedthe gang as a &quot;junta.&quot; The communist pretense was finallyexposed as fascism with an attitude.   This symbolic closing of communist history is only one ofthe satisfying results of this remarkable week. Consider thesweet consequences of confrontation:   In the Soviet Union, the patriots have been separated fromthe quislings. The Yeltsin ascendancy is clear to all. ButEduard Shevardnadze, the former foreign minister, mounted thesame platform and so won a favored place in history, andperhaps in his country's future politics. MstislavRostropovich, the cellist, walked into the Russian Parliamentwhen he didn't have to.   On the other hand, the current foreign minister, AlexanderBessmertnykh, surfaced late Wednesday to declare the coup&quot;unconstitutional&quot; only after it was over. He has someexplaining to do. A special place in purgatory is reservedfor Viktor Komplektov, the Soviet ambassador to the U.S., whotoadied for the Gang of Eight to State and the White House onMonday. He should be recalled.   What about the Great Equivocator, Mikhail Gorbachev?Resisting the coup was his finest hour. Unlike in January,when he winked while Boris Pugo bloodied the Baltics, thistime he said no.   Yet yesterday he showed why he remains what Mr. Yeltsinhas called &quot;the half-way&quot; man. He named a new defense chief,Mikhail Moiseyev, notorious for hardline arms-controlpositions. Worse, Gorby still insisted he could &quot;reform&quot; theCommunist Party that had just tried to topple him. He remainsa psychological prisoner of the party that brought him topower. By contrast, Mr. Yeltsin immediately banned communistcells from the armed forces on Russian soil; Bo knows hisenemy.   He also knows that, even amid the euphoria, Lenin'sinstitutions haven't yet been purged. Sovietologist CharlesFairbanks of Johns Hopkins says that while the coup showeddemocracy's strength, it also betrayed a general lack ofloyalty. The next coup, by no means impossible, may shootfirst and explain later. Faster, not slower, reform is thebest path to stability in a crumbling empire.   As for the West, the coup reinforced American leadership.While Kohl fumbled, and Mitterrand mumbled, George Bushwaffled for a few hours but then asserted American principlesinto Soviet politics. In the process he did what he'd saidcouldn't be done, which is influence Soviet events.   The mere fact that Russians believe Mr. Bush mattered willenhance his ability to promote reform. Unlike postwar Iraq,this time Mr. Bush is properly choosing to build his NewWorld Order by affecting internal events. Such an order ispossible only with a democratic Russia (a democratic SovietUnion is an oxymoron).   In the U.S., the week vindicates those few who supportedMr. Yeltsin before it became fashionable. That doesn'tinclude Jim Baker's Seventh Floor at State, or nationalsecurity adviser Brent Scowcroft, who judges too harshly onfirst impression.   Gorbo-skeptic Dick Cheney looks prescient, as does theWhite House's Robert Gates; the fact that Senate Democratsmay yet deny the CIA post to Mr. Bush's leading Sovietologistexplains why voters don't trust them with foreign policy.   Allen Weinstein, of the Center for Democracy here, has nowassisted democrats from Manila through Managua to Moscow.Zbig Brzezinski gave the best analysis among Sovietspecialists, while Duke's Jerry Hough is at least consistentin saying that Gorby remains Russia's savior. When even LesGelb of the New York Times supports Mr. Yeltsin, you know theconventional wisdom has turned.   A year ago, in St. Petersburg (Leningrad for now), I spenta bright summer evening with Alexi Kovalyov, a 26-year-oldreforming member of the city council. It was one of thosegreat illuminating interviews that make journalismworthwhile. We talked for hours. What impressed me then washis candor and utter lack of fear.   &quot;The communists lack brains,&quot; he said. &quot;They don'tunderstand that in the Soviet Union now no one can operatewithout the support of the people.&quot; I didn't say so then, butI was skeptical.   I'm sure Alexi Kovalyov was among the 200,000 denouncingthe coup outside the Winter Palace Tuesday. Here's to you,Alexi. You now have a chance to get the government youdeserve.</TEXT></DOC>
