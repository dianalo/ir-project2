We did, after all, give AmericaMartin Van Buren and Grover Cleveland. (With MillardFillmore, we'll take our mulligan.) . . . Democrats fromRochester and Syracuse are colorless, but the rural Democracyis populist, anti-bureacracy, and Green. (In many cowcounties, the Democrats are the anti-tax, anti-spendingparty.) Give us our own state and we just might give Americananother Bob Taft or William Jennings Bryan.</TEXT></DOC>
