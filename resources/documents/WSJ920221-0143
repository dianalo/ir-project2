And the contributors, in turn, areincreasingly targeting the candidates as vehicles for anAsian-American political voice.   Officials of both parties predict generous donations byAsian-Americans, with fund-raising activities intensifyingonce the presidential nominees have been chosen. &quot;The amountof (Asian-American) money in this presidential round will beeven greater than it was four years ago,&quot; predicts Don T.Nakanishi, director of the Asian-American Studies Center atthe University of California at Los Angeles.</LP><TEXT>   Observers say the biggest beneficiary of Asian-Americanlargess will be President Bush. Besides the advantages ofincumbency, Mr. Bush's pro-trade and pro-business stance andhis experience in foreign policy are likely to win him thesupport of many Asian-American voters, who tend to beconservative in their political outlook. Despite a drop inMr. Bush's ratings nationwide, the Bush-Quayle campaign seemsconfident that his support within the Asian-Americancommunity is solid.   &quot;We expect a record level of contributions fromAsian-Americans this year,&quot; says John Tsu, a member of theBush-Quayle campaign's national finance committee. Heestimates Asian-Americans gave more than $1 million to Mr.Bush's campaign in 1988. The re-election campaign, Mr. Tsuadds, is counting on a high percentage of Asian-Americanregistered voters -- up to 70% of them -- to vote for Mr.Bush in November. Exit polls conducted during the 1988election indicated that about 61% of Asian-American votersfavored Mr. Bush, according to Tony Chen, Asian affairsdirector for the Republican National Committee.   On the Democratic side, most Asian-Americans are stillundecided on their choice of candidate, analysts say.&quot;There's very little talk about people coming out strongly infavor of any candidate,&quot; says J.D. Hokoyama, executivedirector of Leadership Education for Asian Pacifics, or LEAP,in Los Angeles.   &quot;I see no consensus developing within the Asian-Americancommunity,&quot; says Rep. Robert Matsui, a California Democrat.Studies have shown that a high proportion of Asian-Americansare registered as independents, with the affiliation of therest evenly split between the Republican and Democraticparties.   Reaching out to Asian-Americans isn't as simple a gestureas it was in previous years, when they were looked on bypoliticians largely as generous but passive donors. Indeed,many Asian-Americans for a long time didn't demand much oftheir politicians, says Mr. Matsui.   Says Mr. Hokoyama of LEAP: &quot;The community is becoming moresophisticated in terms of understanding the politicalprocess. . . . Increasingly, they are beginning to ask forsensitivity to Asian-American issues.&quot;   For many Asian-American leaders, the most troubling aspectof the community's limited political clout is the scarcity ofAsian-Americans in senior government positions. But overall,&quot;George Bush has not disappointed&quot; his Asian-American voters,says Mr. Chen of the Republican National Committee. There hasbeen a record number of Asian-American appointees, includinga number of Democrats, in the Bush administration, he adds.In all, Mr. Chen says, there are more than 150Asian-Americans in senior government jobs.   While political appointments may be the most visible way apresident can reach out to a minority group, Asian-Americanvoters also are concerned about such issues as civil rights,immigration and U.S. foreign policy toward Asia.   In the area of civil rights, there is a growing awarenessthat many Asians are encountering the so-called glass ceilingin corporations that prevents their advance into seniormanagement ranks. In addition, the increased occurrence ofso-called hate crimes against Asians in major cities has manycommunity leaders worried that tensions, especially betweenblacks and Koreans, could escalate.   In terms of foreign policy, &quot;homeland issues are veryimportant&quot; to Asian-Americans in assessing a presidentialcandidate, Mr. Nakanishi says. With so many ethnic groupsinvolved, a presidential candidate needs to address a host ofissues such as relations between North and South Korea,political stability in the Philippines, Hong Kong's futureafter 1997, the U.S. military presence in Asia, human-rightsabuses in China, Taiwan's political status, trade tensionswith Japan and the threat of protectionism against Asiancountries.   Besides articulating their political concerns,Asian-American leaders realize the community itself must domore to engage its people in the political process. Despitetheir large numbers, voter registration among Asian-Americansis low nationwide. Mr. Matsui estimates that only 350,000 ofthe 2.9 million Asian-Americans living in California areregistered to vote.</TEXT></DOC>
