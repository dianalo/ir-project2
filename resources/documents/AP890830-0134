Marc Bazin said he has forged an alliance with two otherprominent leaders, center-leftist Serge Gilles and Dejean Belizaire,a supporter of Haitian ruler Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril.   ``We hope to offer the people a credible coalition, anopportunity to have a government of the people, by the people andfor the people,'' said Bazin, a front-runner in the Nov. 29, 1987,elections that were aborted by violence, .   Bazin now heads the center-right Movement for the Installation ofDemocracy Party.   His coalition _ the National Alliance for Democracy and Progress_ will present a joint platform and common candidates for generalelections, which the independent Electoral Council said would not beheld before next year.   The council is expected to announce next month a calendar forlocal, legislative and presidential elections.   Bazin said most of the platform has been written but refused todisclose its content. He said the coalition is negotiating includingother moderate leaders in its ranks.   Three other prominent moderate politicians _ Louis Dejoie, GerardPhilippe-Auguste and Hubert de Ronceray, all leading candidates inthe 1987 canceled elections _ met Wednesday to negotiate a coalitionof their own.   De Ronceray, head of the rightist Mobilization for NationalDevelopment party, said they intended to find a ``common program torun the country.'' They have no formal name for the coalition so farnor have they announced a platform.   Dejoie said he invited Sylvio Claude, also a major candidate in1987, to join the coalition.   Bazin, Claude, Dejoie and center-leftist Gerard Gourge were thefour top contenders in 1987 when thugs protected by soldiersmassacred at least 34 voters at polling stations and caused theelections to be canceled.   Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, who ruled Haiti at that time, dissolvedthe independent Electoral Council and said he would hold newelections.   The four leading presidential candidates boycotted Namphy'selections in January 1988, which brought Leslie Manigat to power.Foes of the government said those army-run elections were riddledwith fraud.   De Ronceray and Philippe-Auguste both agreed to take part in thatballoting despite a major boycott by voters.   Namphy ousted Manigat in June 1988, and was himself ousted thefollowing September in a soldiers' revolt which brought Avril topower.   Avril pledged a return to democratic rule and encouraged creationof the new Electoral Council, which was appointed by institutionsthat included the Roman Catholic Church, trade unions and humanrights groups.</TEXT></DOC>
