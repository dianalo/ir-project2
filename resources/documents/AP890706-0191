(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Thousands of union coal miners whosevacations are almost over must decide by Monday whether to continuewildcat sympathy strikes or return to work for the first time in amonth, officials said Thursday.   ``It will be a telling day for a lot of concerns,'' said JoeCerenzia, a spokesman for Consolidation Coal Co. in Pittsburgh.   In other developments, U.S. Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., askedLabor Secretary Elizabeth Dole to help end the strike, and Virginiastate police arrested 16 people trying to slow traffic around coalprocessing plants.   If the 37,000 United Mine Workers members end their wildcatstrikes, coal companies believe they can guarantee adequatestockpiles at the nation's utility and industrial plants.   If not, the plants will cut deeper into the 30- to 45-day supplythey normally keep on hand. Thursday marked the 24th day of thewildcat strikes.   Many union locals planned meetings before the weekend to discusswhether to return to work, officials said.   As many as 46,000 coal miners in Appalachia and the Midwest havebeen on wildcat strikes, supporting 1,900 striking Pittston CoalGroup employees who worked 14 months without a contract and defyinga federal court order to return to work.   Byrd asked Mrs. Dole to urge both The Pittston Co.'s chairman andUMW President Richard Trumka to begin serious discussions as quicklyas possible.   Byrd, who has contacted Trumka and Pittston chief Paul Douglasand asked them to take charge of negotiations, told Dole that workstoppages are starting to hurt the economies of West Virginia andother states.   Since June 24, many miners have been on a two-week vacation. Mostreceived pay for the time since their time off was scheduled inadvance, Cerenzia said. The vacation period ends at midnight Sunday.   ``We're assuming that people are going to show up for workMonday,'' said Island Creek Coal Corp. spokesman Jerry McPhee. ``Wehave a contract and we expect them to abide by it.''   In Indiana, a letter by AMAX President Douglas Ashby, publishedas an advertisement in newspapers in state mining areas, said minersshould get back on the job to cut personal losses and to avoidaggravating their employers' business problems.   ``AMAX Coal Industries is suffering, our customers are suffering,and most importantly you, your families and your communities aresuffering,'' Ashby said in the letter released this week.   ``Your jobs are available today, and I invite you back before thesituation escalates,'' he added.   The wildcat strikers are under orders by U.S. District JudgeDennis Knapp to refrain from encouraging strikes, but the unionworkers have flouted the edict since it was issued last week. Thejudge is imposing fines on the miners for each scheduled work daythey stay out.   In Virginia, where a federal judge has fined the union $960,000for impeding the flow of traffic around coal processing plants,federal marshals and state police arrested 16 drivers in aslow-moving convoy.   Striking miners in Ohio planned to discuss returning to work whenthe national vacation period ends at midnight Sunday. Some fearedtheir employers would hire replacement workers and bust the union,which signed a no-strike contract with the Bituminous Coal OperatorsAssociation in February 1988.   ``Some of them think if this goes down the drain, miners might bein bad shape,'' said Charlie Greer, president of a UMW localrepresenting Zanesville, Ohio-area miners.   Sentiments seemed similar in Virginia, said Steve Anderson, aspokesman for Westmoreland Coal.   ``Some people seem to think there are going to be some votestaken in the next couple of days,'' Anderson said. ``The sense thatyou get is that there is a high level of interest in people goingback. It doesn't mean that they won't go back out later, but that'sjust based on what our guys are picking up.''   Union officials in Washington could not be reached Thursday.</TEXT></DOC>
