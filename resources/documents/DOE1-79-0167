This dissertation consists of two parts. The first part presentsa new knowledge-based approach to the problems of processing multipleconcurrent queries and distributing replicated data objects for furtherimprovement of the overall system performance. The second part dealswith distributed database design, i.e., designing horizontal fragmentsusing a semantic knowledge, and allocating data in a distributed environment.The semantic knowledge on data such as functional dependencies and semantic-data-integrityconstraints are newly exploited for the identification of subset relationshipsbetween intermediate results of query executions involving joins, suchthat the (intermediate) results of queries can be utilized for the efficientprocessing of other queries. The expertise on the collective processingof multiple transactions is embodied into the rules of a rule-based expertsystem, MTP (Multiple Transaction Processor). In the second part, MTPis applied for the determination of horizontal fragments exploiting thesemantic knowledge. Heuristics for allocating data in local area networksare developed.</TEXT></DOC>
