Chrysler Canada Ltd. said quality problems with some parts and other start-up problems that forced the plant to close Nov. 4 have been resolved. It didn't elaborate. It said that it lost about 1,000 units of production during the closing but that this wouldn't delay the public launch of the Premier in December.    The unit said about 1,200 of the plant's 1,400 workers are scheduled to return to their jobs today. The plant's remaining 200 workers were recalled previously. </TEXT></DOC>
