Meanwhile, at Hyundai Precision and Industry Co. in Changwon,striking workers freed one of the 11 company executives they tookhostage Friday.   Both companies are subsidiaries of the massive Hyundai groupconglomerate.   Officials at Hyundai Motor Co., South Korea's largest carmaker,said they had no choice but to lock out workers in Ulsan on thenation's southeast coast.   ``The lockout is inevitable because there are little chances ofresolving the dispute in a short period of time,'' said one companyexecutive who spoke on condition of anonymity.   After two days of work slowdown, Hyundai Motor workers struck onMonday, demanding wage increases of up to $180 a month. The companyoffered $105.   The company employs 25,000 people, including 20,000 unionmembers who went on strike and 5,000 management workers whoremained at work.   After the lockout on Wednesday, the carmaker's unionized workersleft the plant and said they would not return at least untilMonday. They said they would help farmers with the spring riceplanting during the period.   Hyundai workers earn an average of $610 a month after one year,$750 after five years and $960 after 13 years, the company said.   Hyundai officials said the strike cost them $18.6 million a dayin lost sales. About two-thirds of the Hyundai production areintended for exports to the United States, Canada and othercountries.   At Hyundai Precision and Industry Co. in the southern city ofChangwon, 2,000 striking workers released Chairman Chung Mong-ku.He was taken from the plant to a hospital where he was treated forhigh blood presure and exhaustion.   Company President Yoo Ki-chul and nine other high-rankingofficials were still being held by the strikers. Workers blockedall gates to the plant where the 2,000 workers produce trains andunspecified defense equipment.   Hyundai Precision workers took the officials hostage to presstheir demand for wage increases of up to $180 a month. The companyoffered a $55 increase.   Company officials and strikers agreed after 10 hours of talks toresume negotiations Thursday on calls for higher wages. The companyagreed to give Yoo full power to negotiate with the union.   Hyundai officials said they would ask the government not tobring criminal charges against union members who seized parts ofthe plant and held Chung hostage. The deal followed a governmentwarning that police would be used to rescue the executives.   All 2,000 workers at another Hyundai Precision plant in Ulsanwent on strike on Friday to demand higher wages. A striker whostabbed himself in a suicide attempt Tuesday was reported in faircondition at a hospital.   Ritual suicide is a traditional form of protest used to try andshame or discredit superiors such as the government or companyexecutives.   In another development, Justice Minister Chung Hae-chang onWednesday ruled out the possibility of releasing more politicalprisoners in the near future.   ``The government is not considering taking any extraordinaryactions to release political offenders,'' Chung told reporters.   Chung pointed out that the government had already released 1,275political prisoners under three amnesties since summer 1987 andreinstrated the civic rights of 8,710 people who were blacklistedfor political offense.   ``There are few people who are eligible for amnesty. Anotherexceptional amnesty would be detrimental to maintaining law andorder,'' Chung said.   The opposition demanded that the government of President RohTae-woo free all ``prisoners of conscience'' as a step toward fulldemocracy. The opposition recently said there are 560 politicalprisoners it wants released.   Government officials said the opposition list includes somealleged North Korean spies and many who were already set free. Theofficials say about 200 political offenders are currently in jail,serving terms or awaiting trial.</TEXT></DOC>
