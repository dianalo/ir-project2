<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-47-0163 </DOCNO><TEXT>We review recent experimental results from the Stanford Mark III infraredFEL. More than 900 h of lasing operation have achieved from 2.0 to 5.5{mu}m and continuous gap tuning has been achieved over the design rangeof 1.7:1. Micropulses with peak powers as high as 2 MW and pulse lengthsas short as 500 fs have been measured. A multiple output coupler arrangementhas been tested which allows variation of the output coupling from 0.1%to 7% in a matter of a few minutes. Accelerator performance will alsobe discussed and the results of recent improvements to the microwavegun will be presented. The measured brightness of this gun is in excessof 10/sup 12/ A/cm/sup 2/ which is sufficient for operation in the UV.</TEXT></DOC>
