A few years ago, the shy, dark gray bird was threatened byaggressive real estate developers, who were advancingsteadily on its only U.S. habitat in the Florida Keys. Onenesting ground -- a 63-acre palm grove -- was surrounded bytwo shopping plazas and a subdivision, and investors wereeager to develop it.</LP><TEXT>   But now, thanks to the thrift bust, the birds will beencouraged to stay. The bank holding the grove, AmericanSavings andamp; Loan of Knoxville, Tenn., collapsed in 1984,allowing federal regulators to sell the land four years laterto the Florida Keys Land Trust, a conservation group.   Across the country, nature lovers are claiming land thatonce faced certain development but now sits on Uncle Sam'sauction block. Sometimes the property shelters endangeredplants or animals. In other cases, it is the beach or vacantlot that local governments can finally afford to turn into apublic park. Little wonder that some see the bust as nothingshort of divine retribution.   The collapse &quot;was an inevitable result of the rampantgreed of the mid-'80s,&quot; says Tim Jones, a member of EarthFirst], a radical environmental group. &quot;The benefits thatwe're getting now are our just deserts.&quot;   Not all conservationists are pleased with the way thethrift cleanup is proceeding, though. Critics complain thatthe Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency chartered tofix the problem, is focusing too much on the bottom line inits rush to unload assets and too little on environmentalimpact. They also worry that the RTC is too disorganized tofigure out which plots may be crucial to wildlife.   &quot;They're disposing of properties in urban areas the sameway they're dealing with environmentally significant ones,&quot;says an Environmental Protection Agency official. &quot;You don'tmanage a condo the way you'd manage a wetland.&quot;   But for groups that can scrape together the money, now isa good time to invest in Mother Nature. Federal bailoutmanagers already hold more than 2,500 pieces of undevelopedland, some covering thousands of acres, and that total isexpected to climb to as many as 4,000 tracts. Although theproportion of environmentally valuable property is believedto be slight -- perhaps just 3% -- it's a big deal toconservationists.   The key to dealing successfully with regulators, say thosewho have done it, is being able to put down cash up front. Inthe case of the Florida Keys Land Trust, that meantsoliciting $1.4 million from everyone in the Keys -- rightdown to elementary schoolchildren, who trick-or-treated forpenny and nickel contributions.   Charles Olson, who negotiated the deal for the land trust,says regulators said they were sympathetic but pushed formore money. &quot;I remember a lot of times hearing, `Look, welike what you're doing, we think it'd be great. But thatdoesn't matter. We just want a good business deal for thetaxpayer.'&quot;   In East Texas, the state Parks and Wildlife Departmenttransformed 3,000 acres of RTC-owned marsh into a wildlifepreserve. Three real estate brokers had bought the tract,called Big Lake Bottom, in 1983. But when they still owedabout $1.25 million three years later, they deeded the landback to their bank, which was eventually taken over by theFederal Deposit Insurance Corp. The department, spotting anopportunity, picked up the land for about $625,000 and set itaside as a prime duck habitat.   Some people have even grander plans. Frank and DeborahPopper, two Rutgers University academics, have proposed totransform the Great Plains' prairies into a vast buffalorefuge, dubbed the &quot;Buffalo Commons.&quot; Under the couple'splan, buffalo and other wildlife would gradually reclaim thedrought-plagued lands being abandoned by farmers and oilmen.   The large RTC presence in states like Texas and Coloradois &quot;another building block for the Buffalo Commons that'salready in place,&quot; says Mrs. Popper, who argues that anyprairie land the RTC can't sell, along with propertyresulting from foreclosures by the Farmers' HomeAdministration, should go to the buffalo.   But such schemes draw exasperated sighs from regulators.&quot;We are trying to be as responsive as we can to them,&quot; saysRTC spokesman Steve Katsanos. But he adds: &quot;The mandate we'vebeen given is to get as much money as we can for thetaxpayers.&quot;   Despite some legislators' attempts to include strongenvironmental guidelines in the thrift bailout legislationlast year, the law merely admonishes the agency to identifyproperties with &quot;natural, cultural, recreational orscientific values.&quot;   Conservationists are particularly disappointed by theregulators' failure thus far to help set aside a 70,000-acretract of land near Austin, Texas. The land, owned by a mix ofdevelopers, banks, homeowners and regulatory bodies, houses averitable &quot;Twelve Days of Christmas&quot; assortment of threatenedanimals: two rare songbirds, five endangered caveinvertebrates, a couple of endangered plants and some newlydiscovered salamanders.   Through legal threats and public protests, environmentalgroups have halted most tree cutting in the area. A meetingon the site between environmentalists and RTC officials isscheduled for the fall.   Things have gone more smoothly in Garland, Texas, which isconverting a 34-acre, lakeside tract into a park. The cityhad wanted to buy the tract in the mid-80's but was scaredoff when a local housing boom drove the price to $5 a squarefoot. A developer snapped up the land instead and set aboutbuilding townhouses.   But around the time foundations and utility lines werebeing laid, the real estate market went bust and so did thedeveloper and its lender, Independent American SavingsAssociation. That allowed the Trust for Public Land, anational nonprofit conservation group based in San Francisco,to snap up the tract from regulators. The group, which buysproperties to get them off the market while communitiesarrange to purchase them, then sold the tract to Garland forjust $1 a square foot.   Similarly, the Monterey Peninsula Regional Parks Districtin California now owns a beach once scheduled to be afreewheeling investor's condo complex. Developer Leonard Levyhad used the 90-foot strip of shore as collateral to borrowmillions for a leveraged buy-out of a maker ofcomputer-assisted design systems. When the company filed forbankruptcy-court protection from creditors, the lendercollapsed too. The FDIC seized the bank, obtained title tothe beach property and sold the land to the parks districtfor a mere $75,000.   Even when nobody buys the RTC property, the slow sell-offprocess cheers nature lovers. A few years ago, the NatureConservancy, a private group that buys land to protect it,watched with dismay as investors snagged a patch of barrierisland forest off Nags Head, N.C., and began planningclustered homes on the land, which teems with such wildlifeas otters and rainbow snakes.   Then the Sandamp;L crisis bankrupted the investors' thrift,Great Atlantic Savings and Loan, and the RTC claimed theforest. As far as the Nature Conservancy knows, nobody elseis interested in the land, giving the group time to negotiatea deal for it.   And in Addison, Texas, a two-acre lot has languished inregulatory hands for at least six years. But neighbors inthis Dallas suburb are grateful. They have cleared litterfrom the lot to create a makeshift softball diamond and park.   &quot;Besides that place,&quot; says area resident Jerry King,&quot;there's not a lot of wide open spaces around here just forkids to walk and run and throw a frisbee.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
