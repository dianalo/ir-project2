For many people, that's the issue of the 1990s. It'sbecoming clear that corporate cutbacks weren't an '80soddity, but rather are likely to persist through the newdecade. So far this year, by one estimate, U.S. employershave been trimming 30,000 people from their payrolls -- amonth.</LP><TEXT>   Today's edgy employees can get some clue about how securetheir jobs are by taking the quiz offered here. It wasdeveloped by exploring both those factors that havedetermined just who has been laid off in the past and theoutlook for specific jobs, career paths and industries with anumber of academics, consultants and corporate executives.   A high tally on this unscientific quiz (on which possiblescores range from 24 to zero) shouldn't prompt people tostart clearing out their desks. Paul Hirsch, a professor atNorthwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, notesthat in any cutback, &quot;more people are scared than wind upgetting hurt. Whenever 10% get cut, 90% worry that it willhappen to them.&quot;   Further, a company's particular style of treatingemployees -- whether paternalistic, cold-blooded or inbetween -- will be a factor. &quot;You might come up with all theright answers,&quot; says Robert Tomasko, a consultant with ArthurD. Little Inc. and author of a book on corporate cutbacks.&quot;But you can't assume your company is acting rationally.&quot;   Still, the answers provide clues to help people look attheir jobs the way their bosses do.                                                                                                          TEST YOURSELF                                                                                                          1. What industry is your company in?                                                                                                          2. How big is your company, in annual sales?                                                                                                          Large: over $500 million   Medium: $50 million to $500 million   Small: under $50 million   3. Has your company's market share or revenue declinedrecently?                                                                                                          4. What region do you work in?

Has your company pared staff before?                                                                                                          6. What kind of job do you have?                                                                                                          Senior management   Middle management   Supervisory                                                                                                          7. If a supervisor or manager, how many people report toyou?                                                                                                          Zero to two   Three to seven   Eight or more                                                                                                          8. Can your job be done more cheaply by outsiders?                                                                                                          9. Do you have contact with customers?                                                                                                          10. How old are you?                                                                                                          Under 30   30 to 39   40 to 49   0 or older                                                                                                          11. How have your performance reviews rated in recentyears?                                                                                                          Excellent   Good   Satisfactory   Poor                                                                                                          12. Are your skills flexible?                                                                                                          SCORING THE RESULTS                                                                                                          1. Industry: Score a point for financial-servicesindustries such as banking, brokerage and insurancecompanies.   These, says Mr. Tomasko of Arthur D. Little, are theindustries most prone to cutbacks in the early 1990s, alongwith utilities, local telephone companies, consumer-goodsmakers (still takeover candidates), defense contractors (hurtby spending cutbacks) and retailers. Score a point for all ofthese fields.   Give yourself a zero if you are in an industry less likelyto cut back, including heavy manufacturers such asmachine-tool companies, which already cut heavily in the'80s.                                                                                                          2. Size: Score two points if your employer is a largecompany, one if medium-sized and zero if small.   &quot;In general, the bigger the company, the more likely it isto be cutting,&quot; says Dan Lacey of Lacey andamp; Co., consultants.An American Management Association survey of personnelmanagers at more than 1,200 companies confirms the trend:Nearly one-third of companies with annual sales exceeding$500 million plan staff cuts; fewer than 10% of companieswith under $10 million in sales reported such plans.                                                                                                          3. Market share: Count three points for a recent big dropin market share.   &quot;Market share was probably the most prevalent reason&quot; forstaff cuts in the '80s, says Aneil Mishra, a researchassociate working on a continuing University of Michiganstudy of 30 automotive suppliers. Even within individualcompanies, units with poorer market-share performance were&quot;much more aggressive&quot; in cutting staff, he says.                                                                                                          4. Location: Score two points if your job is in theNortheast, one for the Midwest and zero for the South orWest.   In the past three years, &quot;the big unemployment increaseshave been largely in the Northeast; the big employmentincreases have been largely in the West,&quot; says SamuelEhrenhalt, Northeast regional commissioner for the Bureau ofLabor Statistics. He notes that New York dropped to No. 45among states in job growth last year from No. 27 in 1987. Inthe past three years, the bottom 10 states for job growthhave included New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts andConnecticut. Over the same time, Idaho, Washington, Oregonand Utah all climbed into the top 10.                                                                                                          5. History: Give yourself two points if your company hasalready had early retirement or layoff programs, zero if ithasn't.   If you think you're safe because your company has madecuts, think again. The recent American Management Associationstudy concluded that &quot;the best predictor of future work-forcecuts was past work-force cuts,&quot; says Eric Greenberg, editorof the study. Of companies that had cut staff in the past, hesays, 29% planned to do so again; of companies that had nevercut staff, only 7% planned future cuts.                                                                                                          6. Type of job: Point scores depend on individual factors.   If your company recently has faced, or faces, a leveragedbuy-out or merger, give yourself a point if you're a seniormanager or supervisor. &quot;The highest executives are vulnerablein a company that is being bought out,&quot; says James Buttimer,director of organizational planning at Arthur D. Little. And,he advises, don't be reassured by a friendly takeover team:&quot;Watch what they do, not what they say.&quot;   But where staff cuts reflect the need to cut costs, Mr.Buttimer says, middle managers are more vulnerable. Giveyourself a point there.   In any case, holders of staff jobs should give themselvestwo points. When outplacement firm Drake Beam Morin Co.studied displaced managers over the past three years, theyfound that nearly 30% were from general management oradministration; an additional 16% had finance or accountingbackgrounds.                                                                                                          7. Number of subordinates: Tally two points if you havefewer than three people reporting directly to you; one pointfor three to seven subordinates; and zero for more thaneight, because cost-cutting companies try to squeeze moremanaging from fewer managers.   Today, an average manager supervises 3.5 workers, downfrom about 10 in the '60s, says Jewell Westerman, a vicepresident with consultants Temple, Barker andamp; Sloane Inc. Buttoday, he says, companies are trying to increase that number.Phillips Petroleum Co., for example, cut its management coststo 28 cents a payroll dollar from 30 cents by moving to onemanager per 7.3 people from one per 5.8 in 1983, says JerryD. Fultz, manager of employee relations.                                                                                                          8. Dispensability: If outside contractors can do your jobbetter than you, give yourself three points; if not, score azero.   Employers are making tough make-or-buy decisions aboutnearly everything they do. Mr. Tomasko suggests askingyourself: &quot;`If they had to go outside and buy what I do,would they do it -- and would they pay enough for it to covermy salary?'&quot;                                                                                                          9. Customer contact: Give yourself two points if you neverdeal with the outside world, zero if you do.   Many companies, such as International Business MachinesCorp., are shifting their focus from managing to meetingcustomers. At American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., &quot;the Maaloxmoments are if you have little to do with sales or with thepublic,&quot; says Burke Stinson, a spokesman. ATandamp;T is cutting out6,000 positions at its long-distance unit. &quot;There's quiteoften a battalion of people who . . . do little else thanmeet with other in-house people in a series of meetings,essentially writing memos to themselves,&quot; Mr. Stinson says.&quot;If you are in one of those jobs, you may be able to duckattention for a while, but you may not be able to do itforever.&quot;                                                                                                          10. Age: Give yourself a point if you're a man over 40 ora woman over 30; otherwise, score a zero.   The Drake Beam Morin survey found that in the three yearsended June 11, the bulk of men displaced -- 47% -- were 40 to49 years old. For women, the largest age group -- 44% -- was30 to 39. Low seniority also mattered: More than 60% had beenwith their companies for less than 10 years, three-quartersfor less than 15 years.   11. Performance reviews: Everyone gets a zero on this one.   &quot;Performance reviews are more irrelevant than relevant,&quot;says Mr. Tomasko of Arthur D. Little. One reason is theirunreliability. &quot;They are too lenient,&quot; says Craig Schneier, amanaging director at consultants Sibson andamp; Co. &quot;Everyone israted too high.&quot;   Companies in the University of Michigan study found thatas a result, the number of marginal performers identified wassmall, while &quot;the sheer numbers of people they needed to getrid of was so great&quot; says Mr. Mishra. So, they had to abandonusing performance reviews as a criterion.                                                                                                          12. Flexibility: Give yourself a zero if you're confidentof your ability to take new jobs, or willing to move to newplaces. Add one point if you can't relocate, two points ifyou consider yourself unlikely to be able to change jobs orfour points if your approach to work is inflexible.   &quot;The No. 1 skill in the American economy is the ability toadapt to change,&quot; says Mr. Ehrenhalt of the Bureau of LaborStatistics.   Companies increasingly cut back in one area while addingemployees in others. Moreover, when working with a leanerstaff, companies are likely to value switchhitters more.&quot;When you still have 100% of the work, but only 80% of theworkers, you have to appraise who is going to be a helpfulsurvivor,&quot; says Norman Abazoris, a partner with HewittAssociates.</TEXT></DOC>
