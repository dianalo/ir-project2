The Dragonbreath debacle won't hurt Sino-American commercial relations. It was only a class exercise in a master's program in business administration for executives of China's state-owned companies. The three-year program in this northeastern coastal city is partly funded by the U.S. Commerce Department and taught by the State University of New York at Buffalo, where the students go for their final semester.    The course, known here as the Young Executives Program, is one of three programs at the National Center for Industrial Science and Technology Management Development in Dalian. U.S. Ambassador Winston Lord considers the center &quot;one of the true success stories of U.S.-Chinese relations.&quot; As a sign of support, Secretary of State George Shultz plans to speak there when he visits China next month.    The first program began in 1980, a six-month course for enterprise managers taught through interpreters. A six-week version for senior executives started four years later when administrators saw the need to win over industry's bosses. The program seeks to introduce American ideas and, hopefully, goods into the Chinese economic structure. More than 2,000 graduates already hold leading positions in industry and the government, and U.S. officials say several million dollars in U.S. sales have resulted from the executives' exposure to American thinking.    The MBA course, taught almost entirely in English, produced its first graduates in December -- an event that drew Henry Kissinger as keynote speaker.    The 120 students in the program don't quite fit the conventional MBA mold. For one thing, the idea of competition seems about as foreign to them as their Paul Samuelson economics textbooks. The American teachers even have trouble convincing the Chinese students to keep score in weekend basketball games.    &quot;Is winning a basketball game really so important?&quot; asks Zhao Guojian, a 34-year-old chemical company manager. &quot;We didn't want to hurt our teachers' feelings by beating them.&quot;    Failure is an even more difficult concept. Students are shocked when teachers tell them that U.S. millionaires often go bankrupt several times before they make it big. Failure at Dalian would be a grave dishonor. One student, who failed last year, begged teachers not to tell his factory. He was allowed to repeat his courses, but Dean Yu Kaicheng says he won't be as soft again.    Says Mr. Yu, &quot;China has always had the saying that each person would have an unbreakable rice bowl&quot; -- meaning that everyone is paid the same by the government no matter how much, or how little, they work. &quot;Now we are not only trying to learn that portions will be different depending on our work, but also that the bowl is breakable&quot; -- that is, those who produce more are paid more, and those who don't produce at all can be fired.    Many of the students are in their 30s and grew up during China's Cultural Revolution, a chaotic period from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s when capitalist leanings were sought out and destroyed. Now they are middle-managers in state-owned enterprises that have never had to worry about the bottom line.    &quot;They don't have any real sense of the dollar value of something and they want lots of labor,&quot; says Catherine Houghton, a U.S. Embassy commercial attache who taught the class on Dragonbreath Boilerworks. &quot;Nothing has prepared them for this,&quot; she says of the Dalian course. &quot;We're using alien material to teach them alien concepts.&quot;    How do they adjust? Cheng Gang, a 29-year-old computer specialist, has written papers about McDonald's and Coca-Cola. &quot;I am particularly taken with Coca-Cola's idea of a secret formula,&quot; he smiles. &quot;China needs the same thing, not only in making a soft drink but also in running the country.&quot;    Most students say their favorite course is organizational behavior. &quot;I like the course because it teaches me how to better manipulate workers,&quot; says Jiang Hiajun, 25, of the Anshan Iron and Steel complex. A fellow student whispers in his ear, less to correct Mr. Jiang's English than his ideological message. &quot;I mean how to motivate workers,&quot; Mr. Jiang says.    Some of the students wonder how much of their capitalist knowledge they will be able to use in a system that is only beginning to experiment with free-market methods. As the reaction to recent student demonstrations shows, conservative forces continue to oppose liberalization. But for now students are content with the benefits they hope Dalian will bring them -- promotions, the prospect of a comfortable apartment in a housing-starved country and perhaps a car and driver in a country where private citizens aren't allowed to buy automobiles, even if they could afford them. One of the U.S. instructors calls his students Yangtze River Yuppies.    &quot;The future is ours,&quot; says Lie Ji, a student from the Ministry of Light Industry, who notes that 70% of Chinese managers are more than 50 years old. &quot;Some of us could become director general of our factories and even more. After five years or so, our bosses will retire and we will make decisions.&quot;    Because of such prospects, students here make sacrifices that many Westerners would find unthinkable. Although most students are married, they leave their wives and families for most of the three-year program. Four of the male students' wives gave birth in the past year but not one took time off to visit home.    &quot;They would then fall behind in their studies, and the wives know how important these are,&quot; says Zhang Jiafan, a 36-year-old student. He says no one wants to risk missing out on Buffalo -- a dream they talk about so much that instructors don't have the heart to tell them how different it is from the Malibu surf and Southwest desert scenes pasted on dormitory walls. </TEXT></DOC>
