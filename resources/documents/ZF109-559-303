(Product introduction).andO;Ticker:    IBM.andO;Product:   IBM Advanced Function Printer (Computer printer) (Productintroduction).andO;Topic:     Product IntroductionLaser PrintersMagnetic Ink Character ReadersSoftware PackagesEnhancements.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>IBM Tuesday announced a series of new products enhancing its AdvancedFunction Printer family, including the IBM 3900, the highest-speed printerIBM has ever announced.andM;With the additions, the IBM Advanced Function Printer family provideslarge-system customers a full range of printer options from high-speedcutsheet and continuous-forms printers to desktop models.andP;  Advanced FunctionPrinting software announced enables customers to centrally manage allprinting in their enterprise, and to integrate printing tasks with othersystem-based business solutions for increased productivity.andM;The new advanced function printers, along with currently supported pageprinters, can be attached (via 3270 controllers and adapters) to bothSystem/370 (a) and the recently announced System/390 (a) processors.andM;New Printers and Printer FeaturesandM;o  IBM 3900 Advanced Function printer -- a non-impact, continuous-formsprinter that provides customers all-points addressable printing at speeds upto 229 impressions per minute (ipm) and up to 5.6 million standard 8 1/2-inchforms per month.andM;o  IBM 3828 Advanced Function MICR printer -- a channel- attached, cutsheetduplex printer that does Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) printingat speeds up to 92 ipm and up to 2 million impressions per month using a480-picture element (PEL) printhead.andM;o  IBM 3835 MICR Post-Processing Interface -- an attachment to the 3835control unit.andP;  This interface directs appropriate MICR print fields to theTroy TMP 3835 MICR printer for cost-effective MICR solutions on applicationsthat require continuous-forms output.andP;  This solution is provided to customersin cooperation with Troy, a division of Pierce Companies, Inc.andM;o  IBM Advanced Function Image and Graphics Feature for the IBM 3825 and 3835Page Printers -- a feature that enables these general-purpose printers toprocess compressed image and vector graphics.andP;  This feature also providescustomers increased performance for existing text and raster imageapplications.andM;o  IBM LaserPrinter 4028 Model NS1 -- an advanced function general-purposeletter-quality printer that attaches to the 3270 family of controllers andadapters.andP;  It prints text, images, graphics, barcodes and optical characterrecognition at up to 10 ipm and 20 thousand impressions per month with 300PEL addressability.andP;  It is the newest member of the IBM LaserPrinter familyand provides the same features as the LaserPrinters designed for the IBM PS/2and AS/400.andM;o  AFP support for the IBM 4028 Model NS1 enables customers to convertapplications written for 240 PEL fonts and images to 300 PEL font and imagesused by the 4028.andP;  SAA Image Architecture enables the 4028 printer to performresolution correction for these images.andM;NEW ADVANCED FUNCTION PRINTING SOFTWARE FEATURES New functions for IBMAdvanced Function Printing include a new version of Print Services Facility(PSF) for Multiple Virtual Systems (MVS), Virtual Machine (VM) and VirtualStorage Extended (VSE) operating systems that includes support for the newprinters announced today.andM;PSF is the product that accepts application program data and prints it(optionally merged with image, graphics, or overlays) on IBM printers thatspan a wide range of speeds from 3 to 229 impressions per minute.andO;Differences between printer characteristics and carrier protocols, such aschannels and telecommunications lines, are handled automatically by PSF.andP;  PSFalso provides customers system management functions such as automaticresource management, message routing and comprehensive print job accounting.andM;ENHANCEMENTS FOR PSF VERSION 2 INCLUDE: o  A new package providing supportfor all AFP printers which gives customers a simpler way of installing PSFand managing their application growth.andM;o  A new pricing structure, including a low entry price, that more closelyaligns the price of print driver software with the value received by thecustomer.andM;o  Support for IBM 4224 and 4234 printers in PSF/MVS Version 2.andM;o  Support for IBM 3812 and 3816 printers and Systems Application Manager(SAA) Remote PrintManager in PSF/VSE Version 2.andP;  PSF/VSE Version 2 also givescustomers improved job management functions and a sample utility fortransferring print resources from an MVS or VM system to VSE.andM;o  New functional capabilities that simplify the development of printapplications and the management and operation of PSF software and AFPprinters.andM;ADDITIONAL NEW SOFTWARE o  New IBM AFP Core Interchange fonts available withVersion 2 of PSF are part of the implementation IBM announced on March 5,1990 of the Adobe Systems Inc. font technology.andP;  These fonts will givecustomers consistent printing across AFP platforms and printing of OS/2Presentation Manager-based applications on host-attached printers.andO;Availability of display and printer fonts with the same typeface and sizeenables Presentation Manager applications to give users WYSIWYG capability onprinters.andM;o  Document Composition Facility (DCF) Version 1 Release 4 enhances customerinhouse publishing and text processing solutions through many new functionssuch as shading, color separation and support for the IBM LaserPrinter 4028.andO;These enhancements meet a number of customer needs and requirements of SHAREand GUIDE user groups.andM;PRICING AND AVAILABILITY The IBM 3900 Advanced Function Printer is plannedfor limited availability in the second quarter of 1991 and generalavailability in the third quarter of 1991 for a list price of $289,500.andM;The IBM 3828 Advanced Function MICR Printer availability is planned forNovember 1990 for a list price of $260,000.andM;The IBM Advanced Function Image and Graphics feature availability is plannedfor October 19, 1990 for the IBM 3825 page printer and in the first quarterof 1991 for the IBM 3835.andP;  List price for the feature is $12,750 for eitherprinter.andM;The IBM LaserPrinter 4028 Model NS1 availability is planned for October 12,1990 for a list price of $6495.andM;IBM PSF/VSE Version 2 availability is planned for November 16, 1990.andP;  IBMPSF/MVS Version 2 and PSF/VM Version 2 availability are planned for March 29,1991.andP;  List prices range from $250 to $2200 per month.andM;MARKETING AND CHANNELS The IBM 3835 MICR Post-Processing Interface isavailable only on a request-for-pricing-quotation basis.andP;  The Troy TMP 3835MICR Printer is available through IBM's Cooperative Hardware MarketingProgram.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
