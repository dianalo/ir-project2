Congressional Democrats attack the administration forfailing to unleash the FBI in the Sandamp;L scandal. AttorneyGeneral Dick Thornburgh counters that G-men are on the trailin every &quot;major&quot; thrift fraud case.</LP><TEXT>   Before the Iraqi situation overshadowed other issues here,Democrats and Republicans were engaged in a Capitol Hillbidding war over how many new FBI agents should be hired totrack &quot;crime in the suites.&quot;   For all the sound and fury, politicians are actually usingthe FBI in a subtle public-relations campaign that hashistorical roots dating as far back as 1919. The message,intended to reassure voters, is that a forbiddinglycomplicated problem -- the possible collapse of the thriftindustry -- is really a simple matter of cops and robbers.   Such attempts to use the FBI to transform an ominouspolitical or social issue into a crime-busting crusade dateback to the post-World War I Red scare and the bureau'sformative anti-radical investigations under J. Edgar Hoover.During the Great Depression, Mr. Hoover, a geniusimage-crafter, countered the loss of national confidence witha dramatic demonstration of government power: the FBI'ssuccessful gangster cases against the likes of Machine GunKelly, John Dillinger and Pretty Boy Floyd.   In his definitive Hoover biography, &quot;Secrecy and Power,&quot;historian Richard Powers observes that the gangster hunts ofthe '30s &quot;had no obvious relation to the fundamental crisisof the depression&quot; but nevertheless showed that the New Dealgovernment could exercise legitimate power in the face ofchaos.   For most of this century, Mr. Powers says in an interview,&quot;there has been a constant desperation in Washington formagic to make major problems go away, and the FBI used tohave that magic.&quot;   Before and during World War II, President FranklinRoosevelt deployed Mr. Hoover's FBI to track communist andfascist spies, in part to demonstrate the U.S. government'sability to defend against any foreign threat. After the war,as communism spread internationally, the FBI pursued leftistsat home in a campaign that led to investigative excesses thatpermanently tainted Mr. Hoover's reputation.   Today, rather than accepting the responsibility that boththe legislative and executive branches bear for the Sandamp;L mess,politicians are hoping for a little of that old FBI magic.The trouble is that in the more enlightened post-Hoover era,the trick doesn't work anymore.   Politicians trying to deflect public outrage demonizethose who were caught looting the Sandamp;L tills and point to theFBI as the solution. The huge majority of thrift failures,however, and the monstrously expensive clean-up, resulted notfrom criminal acts, but from a combination of greed,mismanagement and lack of civil regulation.   Moreover, no one believes anymore in the mythical specialagents of yore. FBI Director William Sessions, to his credit,is no J. Edgar Hoover. Mr. Sessions refuses to brag that hisagents can track down the pin-striped Sandamp;L villains as if theywere so many machine gun-toting members of Ma Barker's gang.   FBI agents, though still a tight-lipped bunch, themselvesadmit shortcomings that would have resulted in instantostracism under Mr. Hoover. Lawrence Lawler, chief of theFBI's Los Angeles office, says his swamped white-collar crimeteam investigates only a tiny fraction of the thousands ofSandamp;L cases they know of. Gary Penrith, the bureau's chief inNewark, N.J., says he lacks sufficient agents with adequatefinancial skills to handle an emerging wave of suspiciousbank and thrift failures in that state.   In short, the FBI, which has never specialized infollowing convoluted paper trails, is refusing to accept themission of rooting out all Sandamp;L evil. When political attentionreturns to this subject, officials may find that the solutiondoesn't lie in arrests and convictions.</TEXT></DOC>
