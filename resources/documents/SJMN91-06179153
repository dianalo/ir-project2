Pay telephones are labeled&quot;buckey Walter,&quot; a combination of buckey (nickel) and Walter, the man whoowned the first telephone in the valley.;    The beer bottles at the local pubbear the words &quot;bahl hornin&quot; (good drinking) on their labels.;    Although thejargon is spoken fluently by only 200 or so of the area's older residents,there has been a resurgence of interest in Boontling with the reissue of theauthoritative book on the topic, &quot;Boontling: An American Lingo,&quot; by Dr.Charles C. Adams (Mountain House Press, $12.95).;    &quot;Boontling is purposelycurt and short, with a minimum of exposure of what is being said,&quot; said Adams,now associate vice president for faculty and staff affairs at California StateUniversity, Chico. &quot;The motivation was secrecy. And they certainly made afetish of succinctness once they got started.&quot;;    Speakers developed thejargon by practicing what they call &quot;shortling,&quot; clipping off the end orbeginning of a word, so that &quot;tobacco&quot; becomes &quot;tobe&quot; and &quot;whiskey&quot; becomes&quot;skee.&quot;;    Other words developed in association with certain people or theiractions. For example, a &quot;mossy&quot; is an apron, so called after a local cook whoabsentmindedly wore her apron everywhere she went.;    Folklore has it that abartender fed up with his job abruptly quit by yanking off his mossy andtossing it across the room.;    It is said to have floated like a butterfly,thus giving rise to the saying &quot;butterfly your mossy,&quot; which is the localequivalent of the country song, &quot;Take This Job and Shove It.&quot;;     ONE STORYhas it that the verb &quot;burlappin' &quot; was born when a young man walked into astore while a clerk was making love with a young woman on a bale of burlapbags in the storeroom.;    He is said to have emerged exclaiming, &quot;They'reburlappin' in there!&quot;;    Robert C. Glover, 69, tried to teach some of theyoung waitresses at the Horn of Zeese a sentence to recite to tourists whowant to hear some of the lingo.;    The problem may lie in the sentence hechose: &quot;I japed my moshe to Boont and on the way I thumped a tomker.&quot;;   After all, who wants to greet an inquisitive visitor with the message thatthey drove their car to Boonville and on the way ran over a tomcat?; BRIGHT-LIGHTERS' BOONTLING GUIDE; Translation of some Boonville terms:; (box)bahl   good; (box) Boont   Boonville; (box) bright-lighters   city folks;(box) buckey   nickel; (box) buckey Walter   pay phone; (box) burlappin'  having sex; (box) gorm sale   grocery store; (box) harp   speak; (box) horn  cup, to drink; (box) jape   drive; (box) kimmie   man; (box) moshe   car;(box) mossy   apron; (box) shark   purposely mystify; (box) skee   whiskey;(box) thump   to run over; (box) tobe   tobacco; (box) tomker   tomcat; (box)zeese   coffee  </TEXT><BYLINE>  KATHERINE BISHOP, New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Boonville  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910627  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO; MAP  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  682  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday June 27, 199100179153,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
