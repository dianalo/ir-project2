(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Delaware andamp; Hudson Railway Co., asubsidiary of Guilford Transportation Industries, filed forbankruptcy in U.S. District Court in Delaware Monday after failingto recieve approval on a lease agreement that rail officials saywould save the company more than $1 million a month.   ``Delaware and Hudson had been working on negative funding,''said Guilford Vice President F. Colin Pease. ``Without thatagreement, the banks refuse to give Dandamp;H credit, so it can't getfinancing.''   A federal arbitrator last week barred Dandamp;H from leasing itsrailroads to another Guilford subsidiary, Springfield Terminal,Pease said. Springfield Terminal operates under lenient laborregulations which allow for decreased labor costs.   ``The arbitrator is wrong,'' Pease said. ``His actions conflictwith every Interstate Commerce Commission decision I can find. Hisactions have destroyed a railroad.''   The Interstate Commerce Commission is expected to designate aninterim operator to take over the Dandamp;H lines, which run primarilythrough New York and Pennsylvania. ICC officials said offers havebeen made by Consolidated Rail Corp. of Philadelphia and DelawareOtsego Corp. of Cooperstown, N.Y.   Guilford officials said Dandamp;H had lost $8.1 million last year andat least $8 million so far in 1988.   Meanwhile, around 1,200 unionized Guilford employees returned totheir jobs Monday after a seven-month strike over safetyconditions. Workers returned to railyards in Maine andMassachusetts in accordance with last week's arbitration boarddecision.   Although the returning strikers were all put back on the companypayroll, Pease said it may take a week or so before they resumetheir old positions.   Pease said the returnees were meeting with supervisors and werebeing scheduled for physical examinations and tests of railroadoperating rules, a requirement for workers who have been off thejob for 30 days or more.   The workers from Guilford's Springfield Terminal walked off thejob to protest safety conditions following a Nov. 12 fatal accidentin Lawrence, Mass.   A federal arbitration board ruled last week that the strike waslegal under federal law as a protest of unsafe working conditionsat Guilford and ordered the company to allow the workers to return.It also ordered Guilford to pay the striking workers an estimated$15 million in back wages.   Guilford appealed the arbitration board ruling in U.S. DistrictCourt in Portland, Maine, last Wednesday.</TEXT></DOC>
