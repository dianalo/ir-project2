The American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee said memberswould demonstrate at Spencer Gifts Inc. outlets because the companydecided to put its ``Sheik'' and ``Arafat'' masks back on themarket.   The Pleasantville, N.J.-based company had earlier this monthwithdrawn the masks for sale at its 435 outlets after a three-dayprotest and telephone campaign by the committee.   On Friday, Spencer general counsel Ronald Mangel said in aletter to AAADC spokesman Faris Bouhafa that the company decided toput the masks back on sale but would not reorder them for next year.   ``The essence of Halloween is exaggeration,'' Mangel saidearlier. ``It's not an ethnic mask, it's a character mask.''   In its Halloween catalog, Spencer urged customers to ``put onour Arafat mask and terrorize your friends.''   The Arab group characterized the ad as ``an exhortation thatreinforces the negative and increasingly discredited stereotypicalimage of Palestinians as terrorists.''</TEXT><NOTE>Ex-Navy Procurement Official Given 18-Month Sentence</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former Navy procurement official has beensentenced to 18 months in prison for accepting $475,000 in bribesfrom two defense companies seeking inside information on lucrativecontracts.

The national executive board of directors of the League ofUnited Latin American Citizens voted after a daylong closed meetingFriday to create a new foundation and strip the old foundation ofits tax-exempt status, said Ruben Sandoval, special counsel toLULAC President Jose Garcia De Lara.   But the fight over the old foundation, managed by formerpresidents of LULAC to receive corporate donations for the group'scharitable works, appears to have caused an angry rift among somemembers of the San Antonio, Texas-based organization of 140,000.   ``It's bitterly divided, very bitterly,'' said Nelda OjedaSavoy, president of a Washington, D.C., LULAC council. ``Texas hasalways tried to manipulate and control LULAC.''   De Lara initiated efforts to replace the foundation with a newentity after discovering in March a previously undisclosed accountthrough which $88,000, most of it corporate donations, had beenfunneled, said Sandoval.</TEXT></DOC>
