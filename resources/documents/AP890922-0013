U.S. District Judge William Schwarzer's decision was releasedThursday in connection with a lawsuit filed by 19 states in March1988 against 32 major insurance companies and reinsurers, whoprovide insurance for insurance companies.   California Attorney General John Van De Kamp announced he wouldappeal the decision.   The lawsuit claimed insurance companies in the mid-1980s agreedto sharply reduce liability coverage for public agencies, businessesand non-profit organizations and to stop all coverage forenvironmental damages caused by pollution.   The judge, who sits in San Francisco, issued a preliminarydecision in July dismissing the suit on grounds that insurancecompanies can act together under federal law without being subjectto most types of antitrust suits.   The states involved in the suit are: California, New York, WestVirginia, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Alabama, Massachusetts, Arizona,Maryland, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Colorado,Montana, Washington, Alaska, Michigan and Louisiana. Texas filed asimilar suit in its state court that is preceeding to trialindependently of this action.   The states alleged violations of federal antitrust laws and statelaws in a global conspiracy starting in 1984 that they said includedboycotts, threats, intimidation and other coersive conduct.   Insurance companies denied the allegations, and said rateincreases resulted from claim losses due in part to broad liabilityrules in many states. They also blamed investment income declines.   Insurers are immune from federal antitrust suits unless they areshown to have engaged in a boycott, intimidation or coercion.</TEXT></DOC>
