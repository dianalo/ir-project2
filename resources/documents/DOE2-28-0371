Thespecial stresses which are suffered by pressure parts, for example duringdaily start-up and shutdown with high-load variation gradients or rapid-loadadjustments, are indicated by means of thick-walled components, and theireffects on design are explained. With the aid of modern non-stationarycomputer methods the actual stresses can be determined more accuratelythan with quasi-stationary methods so that component optimization results.The results of these computer procedures are illustrated with the aidof a main steam header and a separator.</TEXT></DOC>
