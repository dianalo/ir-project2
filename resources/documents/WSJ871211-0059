The St. Paul, Minn.-based insurer's chairman, Robert J. Haugh, said the pact with the British insurance broker is part of St. Paul's plan &quot;to be a major participant in all areas of the world-wide property-liability insurance marketplace.&quot; St. Paul has held its 26% Minet stake since 1983.    The move comes amid a wave of consolidation in the insurance and reinsurance broking community, as competitors seek access to larger, better capitalized partners with international reach.    On the London stock exchange yesterday, Minet jumped to 465 pence ($8.39) from 289 pence. In national over-the-counter trading, St. Paul fell $1.25 to close at $44.50    Some security analysts who follow St. Paul speculated thatthe acquisition may be intended to deter a possible takeoverattempt for St. Paul by Alleghany Corp., a New York-basedsteel and insurance concern. In a Securities and ExchangeCommission filing last week, Alleghany disclosed that it wasconsidering boosting its 8.4% stake in St. Paul to 20%.   But a St. Paul spokesman said there wasn't any connection between the company's pact with Minet and the Alleghany stake. He said that despite the weak dollar and the current trend toward declining insurance premiums, &quot;we look at Minet's results and we think (buying the rest of the company) is an extremely good opportunity.&quot;    An Alleghany official said that despite St. Paul's possible concerns, Alleghany doesn't have any intention of raising its St. Paul stake beyond 20%. He declined to comment on the pact with Minet, saying that Alleghany officials haven't had time to evaluate it.    Another large Minet stockholder, Corroon andamp; Black Corp., wasn't consulted about the takeover bid, St. Paul said. But Corroon andamp; Black, a New York-based insurance broker company that holds 29.9% of Minet's shares, apparently approves of the plan. A spokesman for St. Paul said that Corroon andamp; Black has two senior officers on Minet's board, and noted that the Minet board unanimously approved the accord.    Corroon andamp; Black said its board hasn't yet considered whether to accept St. Paul's plan. Officials said they couldn't confirm that the two Corroon andamp; Black representatives on Minet's board had voted in favor of it.    Corroon andamp; Black said the St. Paul plan represents a price of about $200 million for its stake in Minet. Corroon andamp; Black is carrying the Minet investment on its books at a value of approximately $70 million.    In London, Minet's deputy chairman, Brian Chapple, said in an interview that the company was &quot;very pleased&quot; with the pact. &quot;We think it is good for Minet.&quot;    Minet urged its shareholders to accept the pact, which was unanimously recommended by its board, according to Mr. Chapple. He said the two directors from Corroon andamp; Black also voted to recommend the plan. But he said he couldn't tell whether Corroon andamp; Black ultimately would accept the accord.    Securities analysts estimated that Minet will earn about $40 million this year. At that level, St. Paul is valuing Minet at 16 to 17 times earnings, roughly in line with what has been paid for U.S. insurance brokers during the past several months, analysts said.    St. Paul said a tender offer for Minet will begin within 28 days. Under the pact, St. Paul has the option not to buy the Minet shares if 90% of the stock it doesn't already own isn't tendered, the company said. St. Paul also said an acquisition would require regulatory approval.    Currently, St. Paul holds 20 million of Minet's 78 million shares outstanding.    ---   Karen Slater in New York and Craig Forman in London contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
