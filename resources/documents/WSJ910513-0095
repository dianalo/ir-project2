During the 1950s, as a reactorphysicist with the Atomic Energy Commission, I had occasionto visit and work at several of the so-called atom-bombfacilities, and therefore can speak with some firsthandknowledge.   The &quot;furious controversy&quot; over whether a threshold existsfor radiation damage to humans is based on actual experiencewith the Japanese survivors from Hiroshima and Nagasaki,workers at nuclear facilities and uranium miners. In allcases, the external radiation exposure, due to gamma sourcesof radiation, as recorded on film badge dosimeters or byextrapolation of induced radiation from neutron activation,provides the &quot;experimental data&quot; for the statisticalevaluations.</LP><TEXT>   It is not surprising that there are anomalies in thefindings of mortality and incidence of cancer, when comparingthe experimental data with extrapolations to the civilianpopulation in the vicinity of a nuclear plant. The datamistakenly have excluded the very likely internal radiationexposure to the subject due to ingested or inhaled materialcontaminated with radioactive particles. Consider: Hot-cellworkers in high-radiation areas, at Hanford or Oak Ridge withknown levels of external radiation exposure, are found tohave a lower incidence of cancer than other workers innon-high-radiation areas. Anyone familiar with a hot-celloperation is aware that the working environment is typicallydust-free, with filtered air, whereas the comparativepopulation of radiation workers may have received a lesserexternal exposure, but a greater internal exposure, whichrepresents a greater risk of cancer.   For someone living in the vicinity of a nuclear-powerstation, where there is a slight risk of higher externalexposures, studies reveal that mortality figures andincidence of cancer are simply no different from that ofpeople living far from these installations.   In conclusion, I believe it is necessary to be verycritical of the data on which all the dire predictions arebeing made. As a physicist, it is hard for me to accept amagic threshold dose below which we are immune to damage.   Martin A. Welt   Chairman   Alpha Omega Technology Inc.   Parsippany, N.J.   ---   Your article indicated that the study covered 8,300 whitemales working at Oak Ridge. My husband worked there duringthe war, in charge of one shift in the isolation and recoveryof radioactive elements, and has often wondered through theyears about what happened to the women who worked there,cleaning out the &quot;cookers&quot; each day, getting them ready forthe next use. We wonder why women were not included in thestudy, as there were a goodly number of women who workedthere, not just a few.   Mrs. Richard G. Parse   Pleasant Plains, Ark.</TEXT></DOC>
