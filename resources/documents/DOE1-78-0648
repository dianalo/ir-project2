The paper presents the case oftwo centrifugal feedwater turbine-driven pumps of a PWR plant. High vibrationwas detected in one of the vibration monitors installed at the turbinepump coupling. The general configuration and the existing vibration monitoringare shown. After mechanical revision of the coupling, a break in onecoupling tooth was discovered.</TEXT></DOC>
