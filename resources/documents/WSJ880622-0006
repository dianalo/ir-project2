Some customers and consultants reacted enthusiastically to the six new models, even allowing for the excitement that normally surrounds such announcements. Investors seemed upbeat, too: IBM's stock rose $3.125 to close at $120.25 on heavy volume of 2,113,600 shares in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.    Still, the Armonk, N.Y.-based computer giant has a long way to go before it can recoup its position in the market for computers that sell for $15,000 to $1 million. IBM had its third consecutive year of disappointing earnings in 1987, largely as a result of problems in the midrange.    International Data Corp., a market research firm in Framingham, Mass., says IBM's share of the $16 billion market fell to 27.6% world-wide in 1987 from 29% in 1983, while the share captured by archrival Digital Equipment Corp.'s Vaxes rose to 21.6% from 13.5%. And IBM's 9370 minicomputer line, its initial attempt to regain dominance, has failed to become the &quot;Vax killer&quot; that IBM proclaimed at its introduction more than 1 1/2 years ago.    Because of the stakes, IBM's introduction is the biggest the computer industry has seen in the 14 months since IBM brought out its PS/2 personal-computer line -- and some say it's the biggest announcement since IBM introduced its original PC in 1981. IBM underscored the significance by bringing together 170,000 people yesterday to hear the news at more than 200 locations around the world.    The new IBM line (code-named Silverlake in recent months but now called the Application System/400) merges the IBM System 36 and System 38 machines. Doing so removes the incompatibilities between two of the three major minicomputer lines that IBM sells and gives IBM some relief from Digital's relentless focus on its own freedom from compatibility problems.    The old IBM machines' ill fit with the rest of the company's products stemmed from some curious history. The machines came from an IBM operation that was set up before the U.S. Justice Department dropped its antitrust suit against IBM in 1982. The operation was in place in case IBM ended up being forced to sell off part of its business.    The System 38, in particular, was orphaned by IBM, drawing little support from the company even though its design was thought to be so sophisticated that IBM once considered using it to build a line of mainframes that would supersede those now on the market. The System 36, meanwhile, sold well because so much software was written for it, even though it offered little power.    Now, IBM is hoping that the AS/400 models, which will be available in August, have combined the software advantages of the System 36 with the power of the System 38. In addition, IBM added an impressive amount of software for linking the machines to others in networks, avoiding one of the major problems that got the 9370 off to a slow start. Consultants say the abundance of that software is especially startling given that IBM developed the AS/400 in two years, far faster than normal for IBM.    David Andrews, a consultant with ADM Inc. in Cheshire, Conn., said IBM generated $75 billion of revenue over 10 years from System 36, System 38 and a predecessor, System 34. IBM says more than 300,000 of the machines are now in use world-wide, and Mr. Andrews said they accounted for $10 billion of revenue in 1987.    He projected that revenue would rise to $15 billion by 1990 because he thinks IBM will regain a significant amount of market share. Although IBM will largely sell the machines to current customers, it's expected to win new customers with some of the low-end machines. And it has priced all of the machines aggressively enough that Bob Djurdjevic, a consultant with Annex Research in Phoenix, Ariz., said IBM's numerous competitors will have to cut prices in the next few weeks.    Digital Equipment says it thinks the introduction gives it a chance to take customers away from IBM. Customers must spend a few days to a few weeks converting their applications to the new AS/400, and Digital thinks some customers will convert to Digital's Vaxes instead. Digital, which sent around truth squads last week to quarrel with IBM's measures of computer performance, even produced a customer who was doing that. David L. Fleenor, director of information systems at the Nekoosa Packaging division of Great Northern Nekoosa Corp., said he has 30 System 36s but is switching to Vaxes for a shop-floor application because he thinks they are simpler to use and less expensive.    IBM, for its part, produced several customers at the introduction who warmly endorsed the new machines. And Edward Lucente, IBM's top marketing official, retorted that a conversion to Vaxes is sufficiently complicated that a customer taking that route would be &quot;crossing the street by going around the world.&quot;    IBM is aiming its machine at small and medium-sized businesses and departments of larger businesses, many of which have run out of capacity on their System 36s and 38s. IBM is trying to make the terms even more attractive by leasing the equipment, sometimes for less than $1,000 a month, even though IBM has been deemphasizing leasing in recent years.    IBM said the new machines are as much as five times faster than the most powerful System 36s and twice as powerful as the biggest System 38. The most powerful AS/400 is 10 times as powerful as the least powerful, and the machines range in size from a two-foot-tall box to a configuration the size of four large file cabinets standing side by side. Prices for the machines range from about $30,000 to $1 million, including work stations, software and a five-year maintenance contract. </TEXT></DOC>
