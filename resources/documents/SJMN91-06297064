With a little creativity and a carefuleye on the budget there are plenty of vegetables available throughout thecolder months that can be used to make great salads. Cabbage, cookedcauliflower, cooked broccoli, turnips, leeks, spinach, Swiss chard and otherleafy greens are all excellent.;   This is the time of year when fresh fennelis in season. It can be used to make one of my favorite fall salads. Simplyquarter each bulb and cut them into thin slices. Dress the salad with lemon,olive oil and a little black pepper. Simple and delicious.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Food  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  LET US REFRAIN FROM LETTUCE IN ALL OUR SALADS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Budget Gourmet; Bruce Aidells, co-author of &quot;Hot Links andamp; Country Flavors&quot;(Knopf, $19.95), owns Aidells Sausage Co. in Kensington.  </MEMO><TEXT>     Another nice alternative to lettuce-based salads is to use leftover cookedvegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower or zucchini. Dress them with avinaigrette made with dijon mustard, garlic, wine vinegar and olive oil.Garnish the salad with some strips of roasted red pepper and a few capers.;  Another approach to salad-making is using a salad as the main course. This isespecially suitable for lunch or lighter dinners. I'm not talking about chef'ssalad or crab Louis, but an imaginative combination of vegetables, meat,poultry, or seafood.;   One of my favorites is a wilted cabbage and pearsalad. This recipe was given to me by Priscilla Yee, who has a gift forwinning recipe contests. She draws on her Chinese heritage and Californiaupbringing to provide winning combinations using flavors of fresh ginger,garlic, chilies, cilantro, snow peas and Mexican salsas.;   The cabbagespecified in this recipe is savoy, a kind of curly leaf cabbage. Ifunavailable you can substitute plain old white cabbage, Chinese Napa cabbage,red cabbage or any combination of the above. Priscilla, being a budget-mindedcook, recommends using leftover cooked ham, chicken, turkey or pork in thesalad. If you don't have leftovers you can also make this salad with a mildsmoked sausage such as smoked chicken and apple, smoked duck and turkey orcajun andouille. Use about half a pound of sausage. The ginger mustarddressing in the recipe is also excellent on bitter salad greens, coldasparagus or snow peas.; WILTED SALAD OF SAVOY CABBAGE, PEARS AND SAUSAGE; 2cups diced cooked ham, chicken, turkey or pork, or 1/2-pound sausage; 3tablespoons salad oil;  Ginger-Mustard Dressing:; 3 tablespoons lemon juice; 2teaspoons light soy sauce; 1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger; 1 teaspoon sugar; 2teaspoons dijon mustard; 2 ounces snow peas, trimmed (about 24); 1 large redbell pepper, julienne; 4 cups savoy cabbage, cut into 1/2 inch strips; 1 firmripe pear, cored and sliced; 2 tablespoons shopped;  fresh cilantro garnishwith cilantro sprigs (optional);  Saute the meats in 1 tablespoon of the oilin a large skillet over medium heat until browned, about 3 minutes.
