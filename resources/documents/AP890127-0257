The increase in the gross national product, the broadest measureof economic health, was powered by a big improvement in the U.S.trade deficit and a sharp increase in business capital investment.   The advance occurred even though growth slowed sharply in thefourth quarter of the year. From October through December, the GNPgrew at a lackluster annual rate of 2 percent, the slowest quarterlyperformance in two years. Weakness in consumer spending and businessinvestment held back growth.   The fourth-quarter GNP increase followed a 2.5 percent rise inthe July-September quarter. The 3.8 percent GNP increase for 1988followed a 3.4 percent rise in 1987 and was the best showing since a6.8 percent rise in 1984.   Today's positive economic data came a day after the governmentreported that factory orders for ``big ticket'' durable goods surgedin December.   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average surged towardthe 2,300 mark for the first time since the October 1987 marketcrash. The widely-followed market index rose 25.18 to close at2,291.07 on Thursday.   Oil prices tumbled, meanwhile, because of pessimism over OPEC'sability to control worldwide production.   Orders for durable goods jumped 6.4 percent in December, thebiggest increase since an 8.7 percent rise last June, the CommerceDepartment said. Demand for durable goods, items expected to lastthree or more years, were a seasonally adjusted $130.85 billion inDecember.   Demand over the 12 months totaled $1.43 trillion, a 10.8 percentincrease from 1987, when orders had been up 7.6 percent over theprevious year.   Analysts said the report showed there are no signs of a slowdownin the economy so far in 1989.   Economist John Hagens of the WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., saidthe health of the U.S. manufacturing industry in 1988 showed that,``at a good price, U.S. goods can hold their own in the worldmarket.''   But the prices Americans pay for imported goods resumed an upwardtrend in the final three months of 1988 to post a 4.1 percentincrease for the year, the Labor Department said in another report.   The Labor Department said separately that nearly 1.8 millionworkers covered by major collective-bargaining contracts signed in1988 will receive average annual pay raises of 2.4 percent.   For the first year of those 415 contracts, covering bargainingunits with 1,000 or more members, the average pay gain is 2.6percent.   In London Thursday, ministers from six OPEC nations and sevenindependent oil producers agreed to recommend further steps forbolstering world oil prices but stopped short of making specificplans for cooperation.   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has been tryingto enlist the support of non-OPEC producers since the cartel agreedin November to curtail its own production in order to boost prices.</TEXT></DOC>
