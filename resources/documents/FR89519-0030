The madtom iscurrently known from the Neosho River (Grand River in Oklahoma) drainage,including the Neosho River in Kansas and Oklahoma, the Cottonwood Riverin Kansas and the Spring River in Missouri. Habitat destruction and modification,principally due to impoundments and dredging activities, has decreasedthe distribution and population of the species and isolated it into threepopulations. Increased water demand, pollution, and continued habitat destructionthreatens the Neosho madtom. This proposal, if made final, would implementprotection provided by the Act, make available conservation measures implementedby the Act, and identify the taxon as one in need of conservation to groupsin and outside of the Federal Government. The Service is requesting dataand comments from interested parties on this proposal.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comments from all interested parties must be received byJuly 18, 1989.

Two more specimens were taken from the NeoshoRiver in Coffey County by the Kansas University Biological Survey in 1912(Wagner et al. 1984). Additional collections were made in 1951 and 1952in the Neosho River in Kansas and Oklahoma and also the Cottonwood Riverin Kansas (Taylor 1969; Wagner et al. 1984). Specimens of Neosho madtomwere collected in the Spring River in Kansas in 1963 and in Missouri in1964 (Wagner et al. 1984). The Cottonwood and Spring Rivers are part ofthe Neosho River drainage.Specimens also were collected from near the mouth of the Illinois Riverin Sequoyah County, Oklahoma, in 1946 (Moore and Paden 1950). Subsequentcollections in 1948 and 1950 confirmed the presence of Neosho madtom inthe lower Illinois River (Wagner et al. 1984). These are the only recordedoccurrences of this species outside of the Neosho River drainage. Moss(1981) later made collections at three historical sites on the IllinoisRiver but found no Neosho madtoms. He concluded that hypolimnetic dischargesfrom Tenkiller Ferry Dam may have produced temperatures that were too lowfor successful reproduction and growth of the species. It is believed thatthe species is extirpated from the lower Illinois River.Sixty-eight percent of the recent (since 1970) collections of this speciesare from 21 locations in the Neosho River (Wagner et al. 1984). The mostupstream location is in Lyon County, Kansas, and the most downstream isnear Miami in extreme northern Ottawa County, Oklahoma, indicating thespecies is occupying at least the northern portion of its historic range.Although its original range included the entire Neosho (Grand) River drainagemainstreams, Moss (1981) was unable to locate specimens in suitable habitatbetween the reservoirs along this river in Oklahoma, indicating that reservoirconstruction has an adverse impact on Neosho madtom populations.Records of Neosho madtom from the Cottonwood River are from 8 localitiesand 22 collections, with the confluence with Middle Creek near Elmdale,Chase County, Kansas, the most upstream locality. Collections made in 1983along the Cottonwood River indicate that the species is relatively stablein this river (Wagner et al. 1984).The distribution of this species in the Spring River is limited to onlyseven collections from three localities (Wagner et al. 1984, Moss 1981,Pflieger 1971, Branson et al. 1970). Collections from both Kansas and Missouriwere taken very near the State line.The current distribution of the Neosho madtom is restricted to the NeoshoRiver drainage, including the Neosho River in Kansas (Lyon, Coffey, Woodson,Allen, Neosho, Labette, and Cherokee Counties) and Oklahoma (Ottawa County),the Cottonwood River in Kansas (Lyon and Chase Counties), and the SpringRiver in Missouri (Jasper County) and Kansas (Cherokee County). Wagneret al. (1984) estimates that habitat loss through reservoir constructionhas eliminated as much as one-third of the original range of this species.The Neosho madtom is snall, with adults averaging less than 3 inches long.It is characterized by having a midcaudal brownish stripe of pigment anda relatively deep body. The humeral process is moderately long, with somewhatreduced serrations of the pectoral spine. The adipose fin is well connectedwith the caudal fin. The mottled skin pigment readily distinguishes thisspecies from other congenerics found within its range (Taylor 1969). The species is almost exclusively found in riffles (Cross and Collins 1975,Deacon 1961), but exceptions to this generalization may be observed duringearly life stages and during spawning periods. Moss (1981) found that theNeosho madtom demonstrates a strong selection for small gravel substrates,usually less than 1 inch in diameter, and are only abundant on riffleswith \3/8\ to \5/8\-inch gravel prevalent. The substrate must be looselypacked so the madtoms can ``wriggle'' down into the gravel. Adults utilize moderate to swift currents, while juveniles are most oftenfound in areas of low current. Juveniles are found in depths from 4 to39 inches, while adults tend to use depths less than 12 inches (Moss 1981).Wagner et al. (1984) found that habitat use appeared to be very specific,and suitable habitat was easy to identify. Moss (1981) speculated thatspawning occurs in late June and July and that madtoms feed primarily onaquatic insects. On two occasions in the recent past, Neosho madtom populations have sufferedsevere reductions. A drought in 1952-56 depleted Kansas population levels,but the species subsequently returned to earlier levels of abundance (Deacon1961). A second reduction was documented in 1967 when Cross and Braasch(1968) found the species absent from all their sample stations, which werein the Neosho River and at the confluence of the Cottonwood River and theSouth Fork of the Cottonwood River. The species was locally abundant atthese same stations in 1951 and 1952. Cross and Braasch (1968) attributedthe decline to numerous fish kills in 1966 and 1967 caused by runoff fromcattle feedlots, as well as destruction of habitat by gravel dredgers.Pollution laws regulating feedlot runoff were passed in 1967, and streamdepositization has replaced the gravel substrate at these locations. Collectionsmade by Moss (1981) in these areas indicate that the species' populationhas returned to earlier levels of abundance. Dredging for sand and gravel, a common practice in the Neosho River drainage,may have drastic short-term effects, but over a longer time period, thespecies may be able to recover due to the natural depositional processthat takes place after the disturbance ceases (Wagner et al. 1984). Reservoirconstruction is a major threat to the species (Moss 1981). No specimenshave been collected from five reservoirs constructed within the species'range, and habitat inundation is assumed to have caused local extirpation.The lower section of the Neosho River in Oklahoma is a series of reservoirsthat has eliminated as much as one-third of the original range of the species(Wagner et al. 1984). Efforts to capture specimens in suitable habitatbetween the Oklahoma reservoirs have been unsuccessful (Moss 1981). On December 30, 1982, the Service announced in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(47 FR 58454) that the Neosho madtom, along with146 other fish species, was being considered for addition to the List ofEndangered and Threatened Wildlife. Under contract with the Service, astatus report on the Neosho madtom was prepared by the Oklahoma CooperativeFishery Research Unit (Wagner et al. 1984). The species was included inthe Service's September 18, 1985, Notice of Review of Vertebrate Wildlife(50 FR 37958) as a category 1 species, indicating that the Service hassubstantial biological data to support a proposal to list the species asendangered or threatened.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species </ITAG>Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implementthe listing provisions of the Act set forth in the procedures for addingspecies to the Federal Lists. A species may be determined to be an endangeredor threatened species due to one or more of the five factors describedin section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the Neosho madtom(<T3>Noturus placidus</T3>) are as follows: A. <T3>The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailmentof its habitat or range. </T3>Habitat modification, both existing and potential,comprises the major threat to the survival of the Neosho madtom. Deaconet al. (1979) recognized the species as threatened because of present orpotential threats to its habitat or range. Such modification includes,among other things, water diversion, impoundment, reallocation, channelization,flood control, water pollution, and dredging for sand and gravel. Thismodification has resulted in the complete destruction or curtailment ofa portion of the historic habitat and modification of much of the remaininghabitat. Wagner et al. (1984) estimates that one-third of the historichabitat of the Neosho madtom has been lost already. The construction of reservoirs causes the inundation of riffle habitatand changes turbidity, nutrient levels, and water temperatures downstream.No specimens have been captured in a reservoir, and habitat inundationis assumed to have caused local extirpation of the species (Moss 1981;Wagner et al. 1984). Efforts to capture specimens in suitable habitat between reservoirs inOklahoma have been unsuccessful (Moss 1981). The lower section of the Neosho(Grand) River in Oklahoma is a series of reservoirs that have eliminatedas much as one-third of the original range of the species (Wagner et al.1984). The disappearance of Neosho madtoms from the lower Illinois Riverin Oklahoma is attributed to hypolimnetic discharges from Tenkiller FerryDam which produced temperatures that were too low for successful reproductionand growth of the species (Moss 1981). The construction of John RedmondReservoir on the Neosho River in Kansas destroyed additional riffle habitat.The increasing demand for water for agricultural and municipal use willcontinue, with a projected increase in demand of 25 percent over the next50 years in the Neosho River Basin (Kansas Water Office 1987), furtherimpacting madtom habitat. An example of the effects of a decrease in flowoccurred during the drought of 1952-1956 when the Neosho River was completelydevoid of flowing water for several months. The species suffered a dramaticdecline and did not become common again until the third consecutive summerof continuous flow (Deacon 1961). The Soil Conservation Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, has proposeda project to construct as many as 11 small dams within the South Fork watershedof the Cottonwood River. Additionally, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers(Corps) is investigating the possibility of constructing up to 112 smalldams within the Cottonwood and Upper Neosho River watersheds. The Corpsis also investigating the possibility of reallocating storage in existingFederal reservoirs in the Neosho River basin. All of these projects havethe potential to alter and/or reduce flows within the madtom's habitat.The Wolf Creek Nuclear Generating Station, near Burlington, Kansas, useswater from John Redmond Reservoir. To meet the station's legal water allocation,the elevation of the conservation pool will have to be increased in thefuture, further depleting flows in the Neosho River. The Spring River drainage in Kansas and Missouri is rich in lead, zinc,and coal reserves; development of these resources has been extensive andcan be expected to continue. Documented effects include stream pollutionand water depletions (Spruill 1984). The lower Spring River in Missourihas also been polluted by sewage and industrial effluents (Dieffenbachand Ryck 1976). Additionally, the Neosho River flows through numerous oilfields in southeastern Kansas, presenting the threat of oil spills intothe river. Cross (personal communication) believes that runoff from livestockfeedlots is still a potential threat to the species. Sand and gravel dredging has been demonstrated to affect fish communitiesin the lower Kansas River, with the extent of the effects being dependenton the age and location of the dredging site (Cross et al. 1982). The short-termeffects on the Neosho madtom of dredging activities in streams utilizedby the species may be drastic, but over a longer time period the speciesmay be able to recover if the situation is not compounded by additionalthreats. B. <T3>Overutilization of commercial, recreational, scientific, or educationpurposes. </T3>There is no evidence to suggest overutilization of the Neoshomadtom for any of these purposes. C. <T3>Disease or predation. </T3>There is no evidence of threats to the Neoshomadtom from disease. Efforts to improve the sport fishery in the Statehave resulted in an increase in such predators as white bass (<T3>Morone chrysops</T3>) and walleye (<T3>Stizostedion vitreum</T3>) in most reservoirs, and it is likely thesepredators have also increased in the associated rivers. It is not knownwhether predation on Neosho madtom has increased. It is unknown what role interspecific competition may play in determiningNeosho madtom abundance. Where the species occurs along with the slendermadtom (<T3>Noturus exilis</T3>) in the Spring River, <T3>N. exilis </T3>is generally found in habitat typically occupied by<T3>N. placidus, </T3>with <T3>N. placidus </T3>found in more marginal habitat (Frank Cross, personalcommunication). the slender madtom is not common in the Neosho or CottonwoodRivers where the Neosho madtom is most abundant. D. <T3>The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. </T3>The Neosho madtomis officially listed as threatened by the State of Kansas, and endangeredby the States of Oklahoma and Missouri. All three States prohibit takingthis fish without a State permit. The Kansas Department of Wildlife andParks has designated portions of the Cottonwood, Neosho, and Spring Riversas critical habitat for the Neosho madtom. The Department also requiresa permit for public actions in Kansas which have the potential to destroyindividuals of an endangered or threatened species of the critical habitat.Activities subject to such permits include publicly funded or State offederally assisted actions, or any action requiring a permit from any otherState or Federal agency. However, the penalty for violating a Kansas permitfor a threatened species is only a maximum fine of $500 and/or 30 daysin jail, which is probably not sufficient to deter adverse actions fromoccurring for large projects. Federal actions are not subject to the Statelaw unless specifically provided by Congress. Thus, it appears that insome cases the existing regulatory mechanisms are inadequate to protectthe Neosho madtom. Federal listing would provide additional protectionby requiring Federal permits for taking the fish and by requiring Federalagencies to consult with the Service when projects they fund, authorize,or carry out may affect the speciesE. <T3>Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.</T3>The Neosho madtom has recently exhibited severe population declinesdue to pollution and drought (Deacon 1961; Cross and Braasch 1968). Whiledrought is a natural phenomenon, the effects of drought are intensifiedby human degradation. The species occupies a very specialized macrohabitat,and its range has significantly decreased in the last 20 years. The species'range is now divided into three populations: In the Neosho and CottonwoodRivers above John Redmond Reservoir in Kansas, the Neosho River below JohnRedmond Dam in Kansas and Oklahoma, and the Spring River in Kansas andMissouri. The unlikelihood of individual interchange between populationsintensifies the problems of repopulation following rapid declines. The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by thisspecies in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation,the preferred action is to list the Neosho madtom as a threatened species.The original range of the species has decreased to three populations inthree rivers. The factors which brought the species to this condition arestill threatening it. Because the species remains abundant in some locations,it is unlikely the species will become extinct in the foreseeable future.Therefore, endangered status is considered inappropriate. For reasons givenbelow, it is not considered prudent to propose designation of criticalhabitat. <ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat </ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that to the maximum extentprudent and determinable, the Secretary designate any habitat of a specieswhich is considered to be critical habitat at the time the species is determinedto be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that determined to beendangered or threatened. The Service finds that designation of criticalhabitat is not prudent for this species at this time. Although intentionaltaking of the Neosho madtom is presently not known to be a problem, thespecies could be vulnerable to this threat. The fish is found in very specialized,easily identifiable habitat. Most of the inhabited stream reaches are easilyaccessible by road, making it very easy for someone to intentionally poisonthem. The Service believes that no benefit to the species can be identifiedthat would outweigh the potential threats of vandalism which might be exacerbatedby the publication of a detailed critical habitat description and maps.All the involved agencies will be informed of the location of the populationsof the Neosho madtom and the importance of protecting this species' habitat.No further notification benefits would accrue from designating criticalhabitat. Protection of the species' habitat and its proper management willbe addressed through the recovery process and through seciton 7 consultations.Therefore, it would not be prudent to determine critical habitat for theNeosho madtom at this time. <ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures </ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The EndangeredSpecies Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation withthe States, and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listedspecies. Such actions are initiated by the Service following listing. Theprotection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against takingand harm are discussed, in part, below. Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if anyis being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperationprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requiresFederal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action thatis likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed species orresult in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat.If a species is listed subsequently, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agenciesto insure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likelyto jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy oradversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may adverselyaffect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federalagency must enter into formal consultation with the Service.Federal involvement is expected to include U.S. Soil Conservation Servicewater retention practices and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers stream modificationpractices. The Soil Conservation Service conducts water retention projectswithin the watersheds of the three river systems sustaining the madtom.The Corps of Engineers conducts activities and issues permits to applicantsfor activities such as impoundment, channelization, flood control, anddredging. The above agencies may be required to consult with the Serviceon such activities to insure that they are not likely to jeopardize thecontinued existence of this species.The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 and 17.31 setforth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to allthreatened wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for anyperson subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to take, importor export, ship in interstate commerce in the course of commercial activity,or sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce any listedspecies. It also is illegal to possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport,or ship any such wildlife that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptionswould apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies.Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involvingthreatened wildlife species under certain circumstances. Regulations governingpermits are at 50 CFR 17.22, 17.23, and 17.32. Such permits are availablefor scientific purposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of thespecies, and/or for incidental take in connection with otherwise lawfulactivities. For threatened species, there are also permits for zoologicalexhibition, educational purposes, or special purposes consistent with thepurposes of the Act. In some instances, permits may be issued during aspecified period of time to relieve undue economic hardship that wouldbe suffered if such relief were not available.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments Solicited</ITAG>The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposalwill be as accurate and as effective as possible. Therefore, any commentsor suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies,the scientific community, industry, or any other interested party concerningany aspect of this proposal are hereby solicited. Comments particularlyare sought concerning:(1) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning anythreat (or lack thereof) to the Neosho madtom; (2) The location of any additional populations of this species and thereasons why any habitat should or should not be determined to be criticalhabitat as provided by Section 4 of the Act;(3) Additional information concerning the range and distribution of thisspecies; and(4) Current or planned activities in the subject area and their possibleimpacts on this species.Final promulgation of the regulation on the Neosho madtom will take intoconsideration the comments and any additional information received by theService, and such communications may lead to adoption of a final regulationthat differs from this proposal.The Endangered Species Act provides for a public hearing on this proposal,if requested. Requests must be filed within 45 days of the date of theproposal. Such requests must be made in writing and addressed to the StateSupervisor, Fish and Wildlife Enhancement, Manhattan, Kansas (see <T2>ADDRESSES </T2>above).<ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act</ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy of1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuantto Section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A noticeoutlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4> on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).<ITAG tagnum="74">References Cited</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Branson, B.A., Triplett, and R.
