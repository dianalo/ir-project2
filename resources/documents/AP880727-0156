The State Department spokesman, Charles E. Redman, said freeingthe nine hostages was ``a humanitarian issue'' and not subject tobartering with Iran concerning Iranian assets frozen in the UnitedStates.   Iran has petitioned a tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, torecover the assets, which have an estimated worth of $1 billion.   Redman said the Iranian offer has ``resurfaced many times overthe past two years, and each time we have noted that there can beno connection between the hostages and Iran's claim in The Hague.''   Hojatolislam Hashemi Rafsanjani, the speaker of Iran'sparliament and acting commander in chief of its armed forces, saidTuesday he would help obtain the release of the American captivesif the United States returned frozen assets.   ``No deals,'' Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman,promptly retorted.   Iranian assets, including military equipment and some funds inAmerican bank accounts, were seized by President Carter in 1979after Iranians sacked the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held itsAmerican occupants hostage.   Many of the assets were released in January 1981, as Iran freedthe Americans after a 444-day ordeal. A special tribunal in TheHague, which arbitrated claims by the two governments, hasjurisdiction over the assets that remain forzen, Redman said.   In the last few weeks, as part of an effort to persuade Iran toend the war in the Persian Gulf with Iraq, the Reaganadministration has sent indirect messages to Tehran proposing talksafter an eight-year break in relations.   President Reagan publicly has suggested a dialogue with Tehran.   Apart from the 7{-year war, U.S. officials said other issuesthey wanted to discuss were the hostages and terrorism.   Mindful, however, of the Iran-Contra arms and money fiasco, theofficials have insisted they would deal only with ``authorized''Iranians. After secretly shipping missiles to Iran in 1985 and 1986in an effort to promote ``moderation'' and to free the hostages,the administration discovered it was dealing with Iranians whocould not _ or did not want to _ alter Iranian policy.   Redman suggested there would be no formal reply to Rafsanjani'sproposal, apart from the public dismissal of the offer.   ``I don't know that there's any reason to reply any moredirectly than we have already this time, publicly,'' he said.``We've replied to similar remarks by Rafsanjani, by Prime Minister(Hosein) Musavi (Khamenei) in the past.''   The U.S. official added: ``Our position concerning hostages is,as always, that that is not something that one can negotiate about,that you can't make deals.''   Assistant Secretary of State Richard Murphy told a Housesubcommittee on Wednesday, ``We will not accept any linkage betweenthe fate of our hostages and outstanding claims. ... Iran has theprime responsibility to get them released.''   Redman said the latest proposal did not seem connected tocurrent efforts at the United Nations to impose a cease-fire in thegulf war. Nor, he said, was Rafsanjani's proposal taken here as anofficial response to U.S. overtures for talks.   ``I don't see any indication that it's that kind of aresponse,'' the U.S. official said.</TEXT></DOC>
