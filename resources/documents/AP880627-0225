Spacious multilevel homes of the newly rich dot delta towns.   Scores of new factories are under construction.   Power lines crisscross the countryside as authorities trydesperately to supply the area's growing economy.   The fertile delta, an area slightly larger than Maryland andcentered around this port in Guangdong province 90 miles upriverfrom Hong Kong, is fast outpacing other regions in the drive totransform China from a backward to a developed nation by the turnof the century.   While Communist Party leaders hope the rest of the country willeventually catch up, peasants from China's vast interior are notwaiting and have flooded the delta looking for work.   Part of the area's success can be traced to its historic role asChina's window to the world: Canton was the center of trade betweenImperial China and the West while generations of Guangdong mentraveled overseas to seek their fortune through gritty hard work.   So when government leaders in Beijing decided nearly a decadeago to open China's doors to the outside world and to encourageprivate enterprise, the adventurous Cantonese respondedenthusiastically.   ``After the Cultural Revolution this area was the earliest toopen up,'' said Deputy Mayor Lei Yu of Canton, referring to the1966-76 ultra-leftist campaign that left the national economy in ashambles.   ``Foreign things are accepted more readily,'' he said in aninterview. ``The people here can easily absorb and digest thingsfrom the outside world which are suitable for us.''   Many of the 20 million overseas Chinese with ties to Guangdongprovince donated money for schools, roads and hospitals. They alsobuilt houses for relatives and set up joint-venture businesses inancestral villages.   In Jiangmen, a city about 40 miles south of Canton, which is theancestral home of many Chinese in San Francisco, overseas donationshave reached about $128 million since 1979.   ``These people, although they don't believe in communism, lovetheir hometowns,'' said Ding Lisong, deputy secretary general ofGuangdong, a province of 55 million people.   Perhaps the biggest boost to the delta has come from Hong Kong,situated at the mouth of the Pearl River. Most of the Britishcolony's 5.7 million people are ethnic Chinese with family links tothe province.   Hong Kong businessmen, facing a labor shortage as the colony'sexport industries prosper, have turned the delta into a backyardworkshop where thousands of factories do simple, low-technologyassembly work on toys, textiles and other products.   ``The labor is cheap and we can handle the products in time,''explained Lin Taozhu, director of the Cha Shan Clothes and ToysMill in Dongguan city. Private motorcycles weave along provincialroads, while color televisions sets and refrigerators have longlost their novelty. Expensive consumer items such as compact discplayers and silk French shirts are available for the more affluentin Canton shops and street markets.   A report carried by Hong Kong's China News Service last yearsaid conspicuous consumption by Guangdong farmers had become aserious problem because funds that should have been used forproduction investment were spent on consumer goods.   The delta's businessmen say there's nothing wrong withaccumulating wealth and dismiss suggestions their activity is atodds with Chinese communism.   Zhang Chengjian, whose tiled home in Nanhai county is topped bya 13-foot-diameter antenna that gets television signals from HongKong and much of southern China, claims he made 120,000 yuan($32,250) in 1987 from the electronics business he started eightyears ago.   ``Now I've got so much money, even if I don't work I cansurvive, but since I have talent in this field I have to make acontribution to society,'' he said.   He added that if a new television antenna he is developing ``ispopular in the market, then I will be very happy and the peoplewill be happy to buy the product.''   Peasants from the Chinese interior are migrating to the regionby the hundreds of thousands in search of a piece of the economicpie, but provincial official Ding says they are helping alleviatean ``acute shortage of labor.''   An estimated 320,000 people from every Chinese province exceptTibet had flocked to Dongguan through April, according to cityofficials.   At the Cha Shan Clothes and Toys Mill, about three-fifths of theworkers came from outside the area. The factory floor is filledwith young women who left rural China to make money for familiesback home.   ``There's not that much work in the countryside,'' 21-year-oldLong Dingxiang of neighboring Hunan province said as she worked asewing machine making ears for toy bunnies. She said at least halfher earnings, which fluctuate from around 100 yuan ($27) to about400 yuan ($108) monthly, go back to her seven-member family.   Chen Zhaoxiang, 22, has worked at the adjacent Cha Shan KamShing Toys Factory for three years. She makes at least 210 yuan($57) a month doing quality control, more than twice what she madeas a primary schoolteacher in Deqing county, more than 125 miles tothe east.   While standing over a box of U.S.-bound stuffed singing grapes,Miss Chen said she not only sends money to her younger siblingsback home but has 400 yuan ($107) in a bank account, a sum that ismuch more than usual to have in the bank in China.   Typically, the workers come to the delta on one-year contractsand are paid piecework wages, living in simple dormitories providedby their employers. Many young women return home after a few yearsof work to get married, perhaps taking with them money for a dowry,officials said.   The mass migration to the delta has created social problems,several local officials say, as some people arriving from otherprovinces contribute to prostitution and other crime.   Although grumbling about the inequalities created by thegovernment's economic reforms can be heard elsewhere in China,delta officials believe there is no turning back and are draftingbigger plans for the future.   Jiangmen official Du said overseas Chinese who want to invest intheir home towns now are urged to help set up joint-venturebusinesses instead of donating money.   In Dongguan, officials want to move into higher technologyindustries, such as manufacturing computer parts, electronicproducts and high-quality cloth.   And the delta's people? They just want to make more money.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, July 3</NOTE></DOC>
