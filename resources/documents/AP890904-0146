Agriculture Minister Carlos Romero has made no comment on reportsthat his ministry covered up a case of rampant bovinepleuropneumonia for four years and permitted the sale of affectedmeat to the public ``for reasons of national interest.'' The diseaseis not transmittable to humans.   The European Commission, the executive body of the 12-nation EEC,has ordered Spain to provide a detailed report on the outbreak ofthe disease in 1985 in Navas de San Antonio 45 miles northwest ofMadrid, in the Castille-Leon region.   ``This could lead to an EEC decision to prohibit beef exports,''said Pedro Llorente, Castille-Leon's agricultural productiondirector.   The value of Spanish beef exports has shot up to $39.3 millionduring the first half of this year from $2 million in the sameperiod in 1986, according to government figures.   Principal markets are other EEC countries such as France,Portugal, Italy, Britain and West Germany.   The scandal comes on the heels of the third outbreak in two yearsof African horse sickness in southern Spain. The recurrence of thedeadly horse disease, a virus transmitted by insects that hasresulted in the deaths of more than 500 animals, could force achange of venue for equestrian events scheduled for the 1992 SummerOlympics in Barcelona.   Critics blame the government of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalezand reticent civil servants for perpetuating the long-held custom ofhiding problems seen as harmful to Spain's image abroad.   The first reports of the outbreak of the disease in Navas de SanAntonio came as Spain was negotiating its entry into the EEC. Itbecame a member Jan. 1, 1986.   ``Something is not working right in this nation,'' the Barcelonanewspaper La Vanguardia said in an editorial. ``There is too muchsilence, based on the belief it better serves collective concerns,even when consumers are left in the dark.''   Critics also view the bovine pleuropneumonia scandal asconfirmation of the lack of rigor and concern on the part of publicofficials for public health.   ``Over the past four years thousands of consumers have beenfooled with the excuse that it was necessary to hoodwink theEuropean Community and avoid having our partners repudiate us,''said El Pais, Spain's leading newspaper.   ``But what will make Europe repudiate us is not that we declarean outbreak and cattle are quarantined and destroyed ... but thatthings are covered up and people pretend nothing has happened.''   At a recent news conference, Castille-Leon's LLorente confirmedthe cover-up and said his region's officials and the Ministry ofAgriculture in Madrid agreed not to make the outbreak public.   He called the action ``a clear case of high-risk cooperation,''adding that such action was not rare in other European countries inorder to prevent the closing of borders to beef sales.   The Agriculture Ministry's sole statement on the cover-up chargesplaced the blame on the Castille-Leon regional government, saying itwas responsible for animal health in its territory.   The ministry said its obligation was to declare an outbreak ifthe disease was nationwide.   The 1985-88 outbreak in Navas de San Antonio eventually forcedfarmers to destroy 4,808 head of cattle, 1,604 of which testedpositive for the disease.   But by the end of the first year only half the cattle in the townhad been destroyed, said Antonio Vazquez, the Navas de San Antonioveterinarian who reported the first cases of the disease, which isfatal to cattle.   ``There's been a definite case of lack of coordination and delayamong the finance, agriculture and health ministries that hasstymied efforts to eradicate the disease,'' he said in a telephoneinterview.   Some of the affected cattle were sold to slaughterhouses and thento the public after authorities certified the animals were infectedwith bovine tuberculosis, Llorente said. The law permits the sale ofmeat of cattle infected with tuberculosis but requires destructionof all meat of cattle infected with pleuropneumonia.   Pleuropneumonia has been largely eliminated in Western Europe.   Spain declared the disease eradicated in 1965.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Mon PMs Sept. 11</NOTE></DOC>
