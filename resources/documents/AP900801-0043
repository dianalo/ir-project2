MANIAM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The trial began today of the firstAmerican to be charged under Malaysia's strict drug laws, whichcarry a mandatory death sentence for those convicted of drugtrafficking.   Kerry Lane Wiley, 38, of Sacramento, Calif., is being tried oncharges he had 16.85 ounces of marijuana in his possession inNovember.   Under Malaysian law, sale need not be proven for trafficking.Mere possession of 100 grams or more of marijuana or 100 grams ofheroin is deemed to be trafficking.   Customs officials said Wiley, a lecturer in computers at acollege in Hawaii, entered Malaysia from Bangkok and was staying ata friend's house when police raided it and found the drugs amongWiley's belongings.   Police said they were tipped off about the drugs.   Since 1975, when Parliament allowed the death penalty for drugtrafficking, 340 people have been sentenced to death. Of these, 112have been hanged, including about 30 foreigners.   Wiley is the first American charged under the tough laws.   At today's proceedings, Judge Shaik Daud Ismail granted defensecounsel Mohamad Shafee Abdullah's request that Wiley's trial beconducted in English.   Malaysia recently made the native Malay language the officiallanguage of the court system, replacing English. Malaysia is aformer British colony that won independence in 1957.   The court agreed to dispense with the new policy since it saidWiley would not be able to understand the trial.   The trial is scheduled to run until Aug. 11, then resume againAug. 20. Those charged with drug trafficking do not qualify forbail, and Wiley has been confined to Kuala Lumpur's Pudu Prison.</TEXT></DOC>
