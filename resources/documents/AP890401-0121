Embassy spokesman John Treacy told The Associated Press that theGuatemalan military asked for the helicopters to transport suppliesto more than 1,500 people in an area in Quiche province 160 milesnorth of Guatemala City.   Thousands of people remain in the isolated area where they fledin the early 1980s to avoid fighting between security forces andrebels. The Guatemalan military says leftist guerrillas stilloperate in the area.   Treacy said the helicopters, based in Honduras, arrived inGuatamala March 26 and returned to Honduras three days later aftercarrying food, medicine, construction material and medicalpersonnel to Quiche.   The United States agreed to the Guatemalan request because thereare no roads to the area and the Guatemalan army did not have thehelicopters to move the needed supplies, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
