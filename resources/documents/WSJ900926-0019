The department said the Argentine government's prohibitionof exports of cattle hide is tantamount to a subsidy forArgentine leather producers because the ban assures thoseproducers of lower hide prices than what their U.S.competitors have to pay. This ruling supersedes an earlierfinding that Argentina didn't unfairly support its leatherproducers in other ways.</LP><TEXT>   The ruling authorizes the U.S. Customs Service to collectcountervailing duties of 8.02% and 24.16% on the value ofimports from Antonio Esposito S.A. and Ultrahide S.A.,respectively. Duties of 14.97% are to be collected from otherArgentina suppliers. These duties are intended to offset theallegedly unfair price advantage that these imports have overcomparable U.S. products. The department said the subsidyrates represent the estimated differences between U.S. andArgentine hide prices.   The ruling covers many kinds of leather, including thatmade out of sheep, swine, reptile and chamois skins. Thevalue of all these Argentine imports last year was $143.6million, according to the Commerce Department.   The department acted on a petition filed by eight U.S.tanning companies.</TEXT></DOC>
