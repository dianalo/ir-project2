The volume dealswith the feasible uses of renewable energy sources and presents an economicanalysis. Apart from dealing with solar energy conversion, photovoltaicconversion, hydroelectric power, wind power, bioconversion, ocean thermaland geothermal energy the chapters presented inform about the three fundamentallydifferent primary sources which, although not clearly assignable, arepart of the energy flows man can make use of: Interior isotopic disintegration;planetary motion and gravitation; solar thermonuclear conversion. Diagramsfacilitate access to the renewable energy sources available (primaryenergy sources, natural energy conversion, anthropogeneous energy conversion,secondary energy) as well as to the energy flow of the earth planet.(HWJ).</TEXT></DOC>
