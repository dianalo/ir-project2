The approach is defined with a view toward establishment ofa set of investment criteria and a generalized method for least-costplanning which puts supply and demand options on a common basis, whileexplicitly considering the irreducible uncertainties we face. A UtilityLeast-Cost Test (ULCT) is recommended as the point for primary investmentfocus in the evaluation of all resource plan options. A rate impact measuretest is recommended in lieu of the much-discussed nonparticipants or&quot;no losers&quot; test. Societal investment criteria are also presented. Thepaper concludes that least-cost resource planning and unbundling of utilityservices are essential to maintain utility viability in the face of increasingcompetition. 19 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
