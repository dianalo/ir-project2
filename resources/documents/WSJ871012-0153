The companies say they hope the agreement resolves a sticky issue before the Federal Communications Commission. The issue involves how much international telephone traffic ATandamp;T would switch over to fiber-optic cable networks from Comsat's satellite services. The companies said they are asking the FCC to accept their agreement and use it in place of current regulations requiring most of ATandamp;T's international traffic to go through Comsat.    Washington-based Comsat is negotiating similar agreements with MCI Communications Corp. and US Sprint Communications Co., a joint venture of GTE Corp. and United Telecommunications Inc.    The commission was considering proposals that could have threatened either Comsat, by eliminating the current requirements altogether, or ATandamp;T, by keeping the rules in place for the next 12 to 13 years.    Irving Goldstein, Comsat's chairman, praised the agreement and called it &quot;one of the most important in Comsat's life.&quot; Comsat has been struggling in recent years to maintain its once-highly regulated business. ATandamp;T's satellite traffic accounts for about 44% of Comsat's revenue, which last year was $466 million.    If the FCC eliminates its regulation of satellite traffic, Comsat estimates that it could lose $311 million in revenue from ATandamp;T between 1989 and 2000. FCC regulations now call for 61% of ATandamp;T's international telecommunication traffic to go over Comsat's satellite equipment. Comsat predicts that without such a requirement, ATandamp;T would drop its satellite usage to only 30%, with fiber-optic cables taking the remaining 70%.    The agreement would guarantee that ATandamp;T will maintain for seven years more than 20,000 satellite circuits, which are message paths that handle one call at a time. It also calls for ATandamp;T to add an average of 34% of its increase in international services to Comsat satellites over the next seven years. Under the agreement, ATandamp;T can switch over, for 10-year terms, portions of its satellite traffic to a more-efficient digital technology.    An ATandamp;T executive said the agreement assures his company of a &quot;continuous supply&quot; of international circuit capacity &quot;at reasonable rates.&quot;    Marianne Bye, analyst for Mabon, Nugent andamp; Co., said Comsat may lose some revenue when ATandamp;T switches to the digital technology, but she considers the agreement &quot;attractive&quot; for Comsat.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Comsat closed at $32.375, up 12.5 cents. ATandamp;T closed at $32.50, unchanged, in Big Board trading. </TEXT></DOC>
