A state water &quot;bank&quot; is attracting deposits.

But the state's reservoirs remain only about halffull, holding less water than in March 1977, the driest year on record.;   &quot;We are not out of the woods, figuratively or literally,&quot; state ResourcesSecretary Douglas Wheeler said Thursday. &quot;It will take a lot of catching up,more than we are likely to achieve this year.&quot;;    San Jose's having a wetterthan average March (3.37 inches compared with the 2.03 average), but rainfallfor the year remains 80 percent of normal, and the traditional April 1st endof the rainy season is just a week away.;    The storms have hit SouthernCalifornia considerably harder, dropping more than five inches around LosAngeles and causing flooding problems in San Diego. The same front which isexpected to bring more rain this weekend to the South Bay will also bringadditional rain to the southern part of the state.;    For the second time inthree years, heavy late rains have rescued California from an apocalypse ofinfrequent bathing, dead lawns and withered vines. But there is a differencethis time around: Officials are not simply distributing whatever falls, in thebelief normal rains will return.;    Instead, they are putting some away for asunny day.;    Since the beginning of March, 2 million acre-feet of water hasflowed into the state's reservoirs. But that's only a little more than 5percent of the surface water Californians use in an average year. (Anacre-foot is 325,800 gallons, about as much water as a family of five used athome and work before the drought.);    With supplies remaining so low, thestate and federal officials who run California's giant water projects areconsidering only the slightest changes in the draconian supply reductions theyannounced last month.;    State Water Resources Director David Kennedy saidThursday &quot;there is a pretty strong likelihood&quot; that cities will get more thanthe expected 10 percent of their normal supplies. But that figure is unlikelyto rise above 20 percent, and Kennedy said it is extremely unlikely thatfarmers will still get any water at all.;    Federal officials are being evenmore conservative, refusing to consider relaxing announced cutbacks of up to75 percent until April 15. And even then, Bureau of Reclamation RegionalDirector Larry Hancock said Thursday, &quot;We're certainly going to protect asmuch as we can in storage for next year.&quot;;    Officials say these decisionsreflect the fact that reservoir levels are lower than they were two years ago,when planned cutbacks were canceled after late rains. But they also reflectthe tempered judgments of people who felt burned when they released water andthe drought continued.;    &quot;Now, for some reason, God has smiled on us twice(with late-season rains). And what are we doing? We're holding it, we'rebanking it,&quot; said Marc Reisner, author of &quot;Cadillac Desert.&quot; &quot;That's a wholenew attitude.&quot;;    So, what will it take to end the drought, given this new,conservative way of managing supplies?;    To reverse the effects of fiveyears of drought on state water supplies &quot;would take something on themagnitude of what Noah went through,&quot; said Don Yeoman, of the state'sDrought/Flood Center.;    There's no simple answer: It depends on where eachwater supplier gets it water, how much it rains -- or snows -- in that area,and in what pattern the precipitation arrives.;    And forget about it endingthis year -- supplies are simply too far behind with too little of the rainyseason remaining.;    It probably won't be over a year from now, either. Waterofficials say it will take more than one year of average rainfall to make upfor four years of below-average precipitation.;    As an example, consider theHetch Hetchy system that serves San Francisco, the Peninsula and parts ofAlameda County. On July 1, officials traditionally like to have 1.4 millionacre-feet in storage -- roughly a two-year supply.;    But the system'sreservoirs now contain about 400,000 acre-feet; even with melted snow fromrecent storms and the rain expected this weekend, the total is expected torise only to about 500,000 acre-feet by July 1, according to General ManagerAndy Moran. In a &quot;normal&quot; year, Moran said, the system's reservoirs captureabout 700,000 acre-feet of water. So even normal rainfall next winter wouldstill leave the reservoirs below average in July 1992.;    Other watermanagers offered similar calculations. Leo Cournoyer, water-supply manager forthe Santa Clara Valley Water District, said it would take several years ofnormal rainfall for the county's water supplies to return to normal becausemuch of the water is stored below ground, where it takes time to filter down.;   &quot;You don't fill that up like you fill up a bathtub,&quot; he said.;    It won'tbe any easier for the massive federal and state water projects. Hancockestimated it would take two years of normal rainfall to refill the federalsystem; Kennedy declined to offer a similar estimate for the state system.;   Still, the recent rains -- and state efforts to shift water from farms tocities -- promise to make many Californians' lives easier this summer. Stateofficials said Thursday that they had contracts to buy 380,000 acre-feet ofwater, primarily from farmers in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, forthe &quot;bank&quot; created by Gov. Pete Wilson last month. Officials expect toconclude negotiations for another 300,000 acre-feet soon.;    And by allaccounts there's more on the way. Wet weather -- not just these weak-kneeddrizzles, but steady downpours -- should continue through next week.;    &quot;It'sgrim for California sunshine lovers,&quot; said Paul Hamilton at the NationalWeather Service.;    But there's a trade-off. There are mountains moss-greento the east. Between storms the kind of cottony clouds in which kids lying ontheir backs see giants and sabertooths and gunboats.;    The fact you can seeanything at all, said Hamilton, is because the storm air blowing down fromAlaska is cold and clean, its raindrops washing out the pollution.;    Even ifthe rains keep up, the Santa Clara County water users will likely imposemoderate conservation measures to make up for an expected 90 percent cut instate water and 75 percent cut in federal water.;    If there are going to betorrents, they'd better come quick. By all indications, said the weatherservice's Hamilton, the rain has until mid-April.;     Area Rainfall;                      Last Total   Year Normal   Last;                        24  for     to     to    year Season;                     hours storm(*) date(*)(*) date to date normal; Alma           8 a.m. 0.32 0.32  21.17      --   15.22     --; Bonny Doon     9 a.m. 0.60 0.60  18.15      --   21.08      --; BoulderCreek  9 a.m. 0.61 0.61  29.09  47.62   22.94  54.71; Campbell       5 p.m.0.21 0.21   9.59  14.06    8.19  16.21; Cupertino      8 a.m. 0.22 0.22  10.58 15.53    9.11  18.44; Felton         8 a.m. 0.37 0.37  24.35  36.95   18.76 41.92; Fremont        8 a.m. 0.16 0.16   9.94   15.02   10.58  18.27; Gilroy        9 a.m. 0.20 0.20  15.11       --       --      --; Los Altos      8 a.m.0.23 0.23   9.90   15.03    9.41  17.45; Los Gatos      5 p.m. 0.32 0.32 14.25   22.85   10.93  26.02; Milpitas       Noon   0.42 0.42   8.93       --   7.19      --; Monterey       8 a.m. 0.24 0.24   10.40  15.24   12.21     --; Morgan Hill    8 a.m. 0.44 0.44   13.35      --   11.90      --; Mtn.
