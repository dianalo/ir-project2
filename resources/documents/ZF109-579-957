(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Network 911 OUTSOURCING MAY ADDRESS THE NETWORK MANAGEMENT CRISISandM;Outsourcing is not as easy as it might seem, however.andP;  Network managers mustfirst justify the cost to an often insensitive upper management, thendetermine the right inside and outside service mix for their environment, andfinally choose the right suppliers.andP;  Figure 1 shows the critical factors thatmust be considered to decide which network management services to provideinhouse and which to provide via third parties.andM;Horror stories abound from customers who have placed their faith in systemvendors, third-party maintenance organizations, network consultants, andnetwork resellers claiming to have multivendor expertise--only to find thatwhen push came to shove they often had to solve problems themselves or thatthe cost rapidly outweighed the advantages due to poor planning andexorbitant consulting fees.andM;Experienced users caution buyers to examine the specific experience andexpertise of prospective suppliers and their staff and check staff turnoverrates and recent references before making a decision.andP;  However, the cost ofmaintaining larger, more complex networks, the need to curb costly downtime,the expanding service offerings from suppliers, and decreasing prices aredriving network managers to continue looking for external resources.andM;The cost of network hardware is incidental compared to the often hidden costsof network services and the consequences of poor network management andfaulty equipment, such as network downtime.andP;  Measuring cost is particularlycomplicated because the cost differential between external and internalservices is difficult to quantify.andM;Determining CostsandM;Costs cannot be measured simply by the price paid for internal and externalservices.andP;  An apples-to-apples comparison of internal vs.andP;  external solutionsbased on a cost/benefit analysis is difficult to perform, and internal auditsare often deceptive because many costs are not identified and attributed.andM;Costs for specific service and support functions provided by external serviceproviders or official internal staff, such as MIS, network managers, andnetwork administrators, can be tracked and attributed.andP;  However, many costsassociated with network support and service are elusive.andM;For example, some hidden costs go untracked, such as the significant portionof self-maintenance performed by users (estimates range from 15 to 30 percentof users' time) or the undocumented support services contracted at thedepartmental level but never shown in budgets and management reportingfigures, says Harold Cypress, a consultant for Arthur D. Little in LosAngeles.andP;  Arthur D. Little has conducted several studies to find correlationsbetween network support costs and a variety of variables, such as the numberof PCs on the network, the number of software packages, the size of thebusiness, and the ratio of service personnel to users, Cypress says--all tono avail in developing a predictive model.andM;Customers know that a variety of internal resources are used to manage theirLANs, but they do not always know how much.andP;  For example, MIS, usercomputing, network management personnel, and even telecommunications staffare called upon to diagnose and repair problems.andP;  However, little data existsas to how much of each of these resources is being used.andP;  Cost allocation isthus almost impossible to determine.andM;Furthermore, serious under-support problems cause unquantified grossproductivity loss and mismanagement in many cases.andP;  For example, many networksupport and administrative staff are undertrained and are assigned networkmanagement responsibilities that take a low priority because they are not inthe employees' job description.andP;  Support then becomes a low priority, andperformance degradation and downtime increase exponentially.andM;The cost of network downtime is currently under study by leading researchfirms.andP;  Several analyses indicate huge expenses associated with networkmanagement and the cost to customers of network downtime.andM;&quot;The Cost of LAN Downtime,&quot; a 1989 study by Infonetics (San Jose, Calif.),andO;determined that customers spend an annual average of $3.48 million in lostproductivity, $606,000 in lost revenue, and $60,000 in direct expenses.andM;The correlation between the size and complexity of networks and the number ofnetwork disabilities and support personnel required to maintain the networkindicates increasing demand for all facets of network management: faultidentification and correction, configuration and growth management,performance management, and administration.andP;  Finding a cost-effectivesolution is increasingly critical to customers--and is driving the largestcompanies into the arms of system vendors, third-party maintenanceorganizations, and resellers.andP;  And service is becoming a major decisionfactor in choosing suppliers.andM;&quot;The decision has come down to two companies.andP;  Hewlett-Packard and DigitalEquipment could provide full system support,&quot; says one MIS director in aFortune 500 semiconductor manufacturing organization, describing his primarycriteria for choosing electronic mail for his LAN.andM;&quot;They're the only ones who could help us design and implement the system andwould be there once it was in place with an intimate knowledge of ourbusiness needs.andP;  We cannot afford to become experts in integrating mailsystems.&quot;andP;  In this case, the service and support capabilities are moreimportant than the specific product capabilities.andM;Choosing a Service SupplierandM;The right choice for a service supplier depends on many factors, includingthe geographic extent of coverage required, support escalation procedure,onsite service capabilities, technical expertise and experience, packaging,range of products supported, and breadth of services offered.andP;  And thecapabilities of service providers vary by delivery channel.andM;For example, LAN resellers have network experience but generally lack theinfrastructure to support national accounts.andP;  These organizations aretypically local, small, and limited in expertise when it comes to multivendornetwork services.andP;  However, this channel is extending its reach throughmergers and acquisitions such as U.S.andP;  Connect, a consortium of eight systemintegrators that operates in 13 cities.andP;  Evernet (Los Angeles) and NetworkManagement (Chantilly, Va.) are expanding through acquisition.andM;Third-party maintenance organizations are in a better position to supplymultivendor support, remote diagnostics, and consulting services for morecomplex multiprotocol networks that may include multiple sites.andP;  Theseorganizations, such as TRW, Eastman Kodak, and Sorbus, have large fieldservice organizations in place.andP;  However, they come from acomputer-maintenance background and may lack the skill to diagnose andanalyze LANs and provide professional services.andP;  Some, such as IntelogicTrace, are initiating full-service programs that extend to LANs.andM;A handful of large systems vendors, such as IBM, Digital Equipment, andHewlett-Packard, are uniquely positioned today to support large, complexnetworks that span the country or even the world.andP;  These firms havemultinational support and service infrastructures, systems service andsupport experience, extensive resources to justify the large investment,relationships with resellers and third-party maintenance organizations toextend their reach, network experience, and alliances with LAN vendors suchas Novell and 3Com.andP;  These companies are competing with third-party serviceorganizations for revenue and account control in large multivendor networkinstallations.andM;The winning service providers will be those who invest in network training sotheir service teams become LAN experts quickly and those who provide a broadrange of services on a custom basis, allowing customers to choose the mix ofservices they want.andM;While a few very large customers want total service from design throughinstallation, maintenance, and growth, most organizations want some mix ofself-maintenance and third-party services.andM;System vendors compete for LAN business by providing comprehensive servicesfor their products as well as full support for other vendors' products at thecustomer site.andP;  They extend their expertise and reach by forming strategicalliances with third-party service organizations and system integrators whocan provide service capabilities locally and by offering unbundled servicesso users can choose only the services they require.andM;Digital Equipment Corp.andM;Digital has a history of extensive LAN service and support.andP;  A variety ofservices provide broad coverage through all phases of the network life-cycle:network planning, design, implementation, startup, operations, and growth.andM;The company's Enterprise Services and Network Enterprise Management Programwas established in 1988 to provide systems integration through alliances withother network vendors.andP;  Today this includes Novell and 3Com networks.andO;Desktop Service Solutions, introduced in 1989, provides multivendor servicesfor hardware and software and networks for PC and workstation environments.andM;The Direct Access Advisory service provides telephone support for PC(including network) operating systems and application software products.andO;Customers can purchase two-, four-, 12-, or 24-hour blocks of time.andP;  TheDesktop Integration Services supply LAN support including installation andconfiguration on a custom-bid basis.andP;  The service is competitively priced at$100 per hour.andM;Digital's Network Services program is sold in three modular packages:Netplan, Netstart, and Netsupport.andP;  Netplan services help customers developnetwork requirements, design analysis, application design, protocol design,and physical design, and also includes planning seminars.andP;  Netstart servicesoffer installation management, certification, start-up assistance andtraining, and application development.andP;  Netsupport is ongoing operationalservices such as multivendor maintenance management, management tools, andoperations training.andP;  Prices for these services range from $325 to $11,385.andM;Digital also offers a Wide Area Interconnect Service for remote faultisolation, resolution, and verification for wide area links and datacommunication equipment.andP;  The company's Local Area Interconnect Service wasestablished to isolate, repair, verify, and maintain the cable plant andnetwork interconnect hardware.andM;Digital offers a wide variety of training classes onsite and at Digitalfacilities, ranging in price from approximately $80 per student to more than$1,200 per student.andP;  Digital also offes a myriad of other services, includingsoftware installation services, ongoing maintenance, numerous trainingprograms, and disaster-recovery services.andM;Hewlett-PackardandM;Hewlett-Packard provides flexible network services by unbundling hardware andsoftware support programs so customers can configure service programs to meetspecific environments; it considers service and support a strategic growtharea for the 1990s.andP;  HP is a certified service and support provider forNovell and 3Com networks, offering network services, training, and parts.andM;HP's Multivendor Support program (MVS) operates as a profit center.andP;  Underthis program, HP coordinates all of the customer's maintenance needs andestablishes strategic alliances or partnerships with other vendors toguarantee appropriate support for all equipment types.andP;  HP developes bothlocal and national relationships to supplement its extensive field-serviceorganization.andM;MVS services include single-source support, equipment repair, PC hardware andsoftware diagnosis either onsite or through an offsite help desk, design,installation, integration, preventive maintenance, repair reporting andmanagement, and relocation management.andP;  The Network Support program providesnetwork planning and design, cable design, network startup, fault isolation,PC LAN support, network operations, customer education, and networkconsulting services.andM;HP ConsultLine, announced in February 1990, provides consulting services indesigning, installing, and managing networks, particularly in the areas ofperformance and information management, manufacturing, finance, andengineering automation.andP;  HP's 32 regional response centers and more than 200worldwide service locations comprise an extensive infrastructure for support.andO;Customers can call a toll-free number and reach a customer servicerepresentative 24 hours a day, seven days a week.andP;  Customers can contract forfour-, eight-, or 24-hour, or weekly response times.andM;Unlike Digital and IBM, HP provides its own service and support rather thancontracting with third-party service organizations.andP;  Service contracts arenegotiated on a custom basis with HP providing a mix of appropriatesolutions.andM;IBMandM;Customer service and support are viewed as marketing support overhead at IBMto allow lower margins and expansion of its service and support offerings.andO;The company is extending its network services to provide total solutions fromproblem determination through resolution, including multivendorinstallations.andM;IBM's Network Support Service, a par of ServicePlan, was introduced in 1989.andO;The service provides multivendor network support for remote networkmonitoring, diagnostics, and repair coordination.andP;  If the fault lies with IBMequipment, a service technician is dispatched; if the fault lies with non-IBMequipment, IBM contacts the appropriate vendor.andM;The company also works with third-party firms to provide support for non-IBMproducts, with IBM acting as the coordinator.andP;  The customer calls IBM withany problem.andP;  An IBM support representative then determines the cause of theproblem and brings in the appropriate service personnel, if needed, fornon-IBM equipment.andP;  IBM has service agreements with more than 12 serviceproviders, including Intelogic Trace, TRW, and Computer Task Group.andM;The Good NewsandM;Today, no one source provides everything for everyone.andP;  The good news is thatthe market for network support services and training is growing rapidly andsuppliers see a great opportunity to grab account control and substituteservice renevue for lagging hardware revenue.andM;In addition, system vendors are turning service and support into acompetitive tactic, meaning better service at lower prices.andM;Thus, while evolution may initially be painful, the end result will begreater flexibility with more choices for customers, more cost-effective andcomprehensive network management, and greater cooperation among vendors,service providers, and customers.andM;Nina Burns, a principal of Network Marketing Solutions (Menlo Park, Calif.),andO;is a network industry consultant.andP;  Network Marketing Solutions providesmarketing consulting and research services.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
