These temporarytolerances will permit the marketing of the above raw agricultural commoditieswhen treated in accordance with the provisions of the experimental usepermit 352-EUP-139, which is being issued under the Federal Insecticide,Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended (Pub. L. 95-396, 92 Stat.819; 7 U.S.C. 136). The scientific data reported and other relevant material were evaluated,and it was determined that establishment of the temporary tolerances willprotect the public health. Therefore, the temporary tolerances have beenestablished on the condition that the pesticide be used in accordance withthe experimental use permit and with the following provisions: 1. The total amount of the active ingredient to be used must not exceedthe quantity authorized by the experimental use permit. 2. E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co., Inc., must immediately notify the EPAof any findings from the experimental use that have a bearing on safety.The company must also keep records of production, distribution, and performanceand on request make the records available to any authorized officer oremployee of the EPA or the Food and Drug Administration. These tolerances expire July 31, 1989. Residues not in excess of theseamounts remaining in or on the raw agricultural commodities after thisexpiration date will not be considered actionable if the pesticide is legallyapplied during the term of, and in accordance with, the provisions of theexperimental use permit and temporary tolerances. These tolerances maybe revoked if the experimental use permit is revoked or if any experiencewith or scientific data on this pesticide indicate that such revocationis necessary to protect the public health. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L.96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determinedthat regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levelsor establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
