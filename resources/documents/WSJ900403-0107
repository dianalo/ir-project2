Bacon   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>04/03/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE C4</SO><CO>   K</CO><IN>FOOD PRODUCTS (FOD)</IN><LP>   WASHINGTON -- Three new studies financed by Kellogg Co.,Battle Creek, Mich., found that cereal laced with the grainpsyllium reduces cholesterol. But the findings may touch offa fresh round of health claims and counterclaims similar tothe dispute over the benefits of oat bran.   All three of the new studies tested people with highcholesterol levels who had already been put onlow-cholesterol diets. The addition of psyllium, which ishigh in soluble fiber, further reduced cholesterol levels andlowered cholesterol more than other fibers, including oatbran, they found.</LP><TEXT>   As a result, the Kellogg-financed researchers said, cerealcontaining psyllium can reduce the risk of heart disease byfighting cholesterol-clogging of the arteries. Kellogg, whichorchestrated a big public-relations effort to promote the newstudies, sells Heartwise, the only cereal with psyllium soldnationwide by a major cereal company. But psyllium isn'twithout controversy. Last year, the Food and DrugAdministration looked into the safety of its use in largequantities in cereal. In response, General Mills Inc. took apsyllium-based cereal off the market.   Psyllium, also known as flea wort, is grown primarily inIndia. It has been used for years by Procter andamp; Gamble Co. inits laxative Metamucil. The new studies, which were releasedat the annual meeting of the Federation of American Societiesfor Experimental Biology here, all concluded that psyllium issafe in cereals, although some of those in the tests reportedsuch effects as gas, bloating and cramping -- symptoms commonto a sudden increase in fiber consumption.   All three studies measured the impact of psyllium afterthe subjects had been put on a low-fat diet and fed cerealsupplied by Kellogg. The studies were conducted at theUniversity of Kentucky, George Washington University, and theUniversity of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester.   A Kellogg spokeswoman said, &quot;We're encouraged by thestudies,&quot; but she wouldn't say how they might influence thecompany's marketing plans for Heartwise, which isn't a bigseller, or other new cereals.</TEXT></DOC>
