In a Sept. 25 letter to Dunkin' Donuts franchise owners, the company's chairman, Robert M. Rosenberg, said certain franchise owners have expressed concerns that a takeover might jeopardize the Dunkin' Donuts system and have offered to help finance a leveraged buy-out of the company as a means of protecting their interests.    &quot;The possibility of financial support from franchise owners is likely to play an important role in our evaluation of the LBO alternative,&quot; Mr. Rosenberg said.    The letter was attached to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.    As previously reported, Dunkin' Donuts and DD Acquisition met on Sept. 19. DD Acquisition is a company formed by Unicorp Canada Corp. and Cara Operations Ltd. &quot;The meeting with DD Acquisition was cordial,&quot; the letter said.    Mr. Rosenberg said Dunkin' Donuts management has met and plans to meet with others as well, including &quot;strategic buyers,&quot; noting that the discussions regarding the sale of the doughnut chain will likely extend beyond Nov. 1. He added that remaining independent continues to be an alternative for the company.    Cara is a Toronto-based food-services franchiser. Unicorp, also based in Toronto, operates gas utility, merchant banking and financial-services businesses. Dunkin' has rejected DD Acquisition's $45-a-share, or $268 million, offer as &quot;inadequate.&quot;    Dunkin' earlier said it would explore alternatives to DD Acquisition's offer, including the possible sale of the company at a higher price than the DD Acquisition offer. The company added that it intended to provide confidential information to parties interested in pursuing a possible acquisition.    Earl Rotman, president of Kingsbridge Capital Group, a unit of Unicorp Canada Corp. which with Cara is seeking to acquire Dunkin' Donuts, said he isn't surprised the doughnut chain is considering a leveraged buy-out. &quot;We would expect them to explore all the options,&quot; he said.    In national over-the-counter trading, Dunkin' closed yesterday at $47.125 a share, up 50 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
