StevensStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 05/01/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP CANDA JAPAN FRESTMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)FOREIGN-EXCHANGE MARKETS (FRX)PRECIOUS METALS, STONES, GOLD, SILVER (PCS)COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD) </IN><TEXT>   The dollar rose yesterday after a late drubbing the day before but managed only a weak recovery amid bullish news on U.S. and Japanese interest rates, traders said.    The positive news began with Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker's testimony to a House Banking subcommittee. Mr. Volcker said the Fed has been tightening monetary policy &quot;in view of the weakness of the dollar on foreign exchange markets.&quot; A tighter monetary policy would tend to boost short-term interest rates and attract foreign capital to the U.S.    Mr. Volcker's comment confirmed speculation in the financial markets that the Fed had been tightening policy lately.    Later, answering reporters' questions during a break in his testimony, Mr. Volcker said the dollar already has fallen far enough, &quot;absolutely and fundamentally, cross my heart and hope to die.&quot;    The dollar also was aided by a report that Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told President Reagan he has ordered Japan's central bank to lower interest rates. Lower rates in Japan would tend to make dollar-denominated investments more attractive and increase demand for dollars. Yesterday was the first of two scheduled days of talks in Washington between the U.S. and Japanese leaders, centering on the huge trade imbalance between the two nations.    Although the dollar did respond to news of the Volcker and Nakasone statements, traders said the response was unimpressive. In late New York trading, the U.S. currency stood at 140.64 yen. That was 1.5% above its level of 138.50 yen late Wednesday, which was the day's low. But it was still below both days' intraday highs.    In early Tokyo trading Friday, the dollar was quoted at 141.15 yen.    &quot;With all the bullish news, the dollar is still pretty weak,&quot; Larry Ryan, senior vice president and foreign exchange manager at European American Bank in New York, said. &quot;They're trying to talk the dollar up, but it'll take more than talk,&quot; he said.    &quot;The market has still not shaken its bearish sentiment toward the dollar,&quot; Charles A. Spence, vice president, foreign exchange, at First Interstate Bank of California, Los Angeles, said.    The dollar's move was still less impressive against major European currencies. It climbed 0.5% to 1.7940 West German marks from 1.7850 late Wednesday, failing to hold above the 1.80-mark level that traders regard as a significant test of its strength. The British pound edged higher against the dollar to $1.6622 from $1.6620.    Market participants said the U.S. trade deficit and the outcome of the current U.S.)Japanese trade summit in Washington are the most important factors affecting exchange rates for the time being.    &quot;There's still a feeling that the dollar could come under pressure if nothing (more) comes out of this meeting,&quot; Earl I. Johnson, a trader at Harris Trust andamp; Savings Bank, Chicago, said of the Reagan-Nakasone talks.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for May delivery rose $3.10 an ounce to $454.10 in moderate trading estimated at 3.5 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $452.55 an ounce in early trading Friday in Hong Kong.    ---   LATE NEW YORK TRADING                  Thursday, April 30, 1987    Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.

The total was a one-month record in dollar terms, afterconverting the total in yen at the month's average exchangerate of 142 yen to the dollar.   In yen terms, it was the second largest total in thepost-World War II era, falling short of the record set inAugust 1971 after then-President Richard Nixon suspended thedollar's convertibility into gold.   The central bank's monthly report showed that $10 billionof yen flowed out of its special foreign exchange account, anindication of the extent of the bank's intervention in theforeign exchange market. Despite the bank's efforts, theyen's value surged again last month, sending the dollar to a39-year low.   Several other central banks also intervened last month totry to support the dollar in line with a February agreementamong major industrial countries.</TEXT></DOC>
