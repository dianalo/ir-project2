Money laundering is a complex economic crime. A thoroughunderstanding of how financial institutions operate isrequired to prevent their abuse by drug traffickers, moneycouriers, illicit currency exchanges and other financialoperators.</LP><TEXT>   The international character of money laundering requirescounter-efforts that do not stop at any border and dependupon the active cooperation of other countries committed tostringent anti-money-laundering measures.   One example of how drug-cash proceeds flow illustrates whyinternational cooperation is so essential. In a recent case,drug cash was picked up in various U.S. cities and depositedin different banks. Funds were then wire-transferred fromthose banks to an undercover account in Tampa, Fla., thenwire-transferred via New York to Luxembourg and London, wherethey were converted to certificates of deposit. Thecertificates were then used as loan collateral for a bankloan generated in Nassau. The loan proceeds were thenwire-transferred back to the undercover account in Tampa.From Tampa the loan proceeds were wire-transferred to anaccount in Uruguay, and from there to a drug organization inColombia.   In combating international money laundering, thePresident's National Drug Control Strategy sets a centralgoal of getting nations to work together to attack allaspects of the drug trade -- production, distribution andmoney laundering. The Bush administration pursues anintegrated policy that attacks illegal drugs and moneylaundering on the international front. Itsanti-money-laundering strategy seeks to establish a networkof countries joined together with comprehensive domestic andinternational anti-money-laundering programs. These programswill facilitate international cooperation in criminalinvestigations, prosecutions and asset-forfeiture actions. Tobe effective, these efforts must involve the concertedactivities not only of law-enforcement authorities, but alsofinancial-institution regulatory agencies and financialinstitutions themselves.
