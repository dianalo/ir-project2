McDonnell Douglas Space Systems, a unit of St. Louis-basedMcDonnell Douglas Corp., said the joint effort will emphasizefive technologies &quot;that will improve the feasibility of alunar base and subsequent missions to Mars,&quot; as outlined inPresident Bush's proposed Space Exploration Initiative.</LP><TEXT>   The president's plan for the U.S. to land an astronaut onMars by 2019 faces an uncertain future on Capitol Hill,however. This week, a Senate Appropriations subcommitteevoted to preserve the $30 billion space station project, butat the expense of cuts and delays in other space programs;the panel warned that future funding increases will be lessthan what the National Aeronautics and Space Administrationis expecting.   &quot;The near-term funding picture is rather poor,&quot; concededGeorge Butler, executive director of the space stationdivision of McDonnell Douglas Space Systems. &quot;Butlonger-range I don't think it's that clouded,&quot; he said,arguing that as defense spending decreases, Congress willwant to pump money into other high-technology projects suchas the lunar/Mars effort. The decision to team with aJapanese company reflects McDonnell Douglas's belief thatfuture space programs such as the lunar/Mars project &quot;aregoing to cost so much that by nature they will beinternational endeavors,&quot; he added.   McDonnell Douglas and Shimizu will each fund their ownresearch. The two companies are operating under a memorandumof understanding, and they have the option to back out at anytime, McDonnell Douglas noted.   Among the technologies the companies will explore areapplying solar energy on the lunar surface to processmaterials into useful resources such as oxygen and castbasalt; studying possible life support systems; and creatingclosed systems that would recycle most of the products neededfor a lunar base or long-term expedition to Mars. McDonnellDouglas said the companies also hope to develop thetechnologies for applications on Earth.</TEXT></DOC>
