As NATO leaders opened a two-day conference, Mr. Bushbluntly called on his counterparts to answer concerns that aplanned French-German security force and other efforts atEuropean cooperation are intended to supplant the U.S.presence in the 16-nation organization.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It would be a mistake to leave this hall with blissfulambiguity on this point,&quot; Mr. Bush said at the meeting. &quot;Ourpremise is that the American role in the defense, and theaffairs, of Europe will not be made superfluous by Europeanunion. If our premise is wrong -- if, my friends, yourultimate aim is to provide independently for your own defense-- the time to tell us is today.&quot;   The president got what he was seeking as various Europeanleaders assured him they seek a continued U.S. role on thecontinent.   The alliance's new strategic plan reflected the leaders'hopes to convert NATO to a smaller, lighter and more mobileforce. The 16-page document declares that the alliance nolonger has any known enemies, and says the biggest risk topeace in Europe now comes from the disintegration of EasternEuropean nations, such as Yugoslavia or the Soviet Union.   &quot;Risks which remain are more likely to come frominstability than calculated aggression,&quot; a senior NATOofficial said.   The document vows to &quot;maintain military strength adequateto convince any potential aggressor that the use of force&quot;against any member would meet &quot;collective and effectiveaction.&quot; The plan also calls for maintaining what Mr. Bushcalled &quot;a credible, though radically reduced nucleardeterrent.&quot; NATO members agreed several weeks ago to reduceNATO's nuclear arsenal about 80%.   Even before the meeting began, German Chancellor HelmutKohl moved to allay U.S. concerns about its continued role inEurope. He called a united Europe without NATO &quot;unthinkable.&quot;European leaders have maintained privately that they welcomea continued U.S. presence, but public comments from someFrench officials have had a &quot;disturbing tone&quot; that suggestedotherwise, a senior U.S. official said. Because of suchcomments, the official added, Mr. Bush &quot;wanted to be veryclear and very blunt and get all the cards on the table.&quot;   The administration official noted that another reason forseeking affirmation of the U.S. role was concern that supportis eroding in the U.S. for foreign military commitments.&quot;There's going to be more pressure from Americans to notprovide the support than to do it,&quot; the official said. Inrecent weeks, Mr. Bush himself has come under increasingcriticism for spending too much time on foreign affairs,leading him to cancel a scheduled trip to Asia this month.   Italian Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis said Mr. Bushreceived an unequivocal and unambiguous answer that the U.S.is still needed. And each of the other 15 leaders personallyendorsed a statement -- to be made public today -- callingNATO the leading force in Western security.   &quot;Europe does want to maintain the trans-Atlanticpartnership, including the military dimension,&quot; Mr. DeMichelis said. &quot;And I think {President Bush} was totallysatisfied with the answer he heard.&quot;   French President Francois Mitterrand expended considerableenergy here trying to make sure that no decision by NATOwould deter the 12 European Community countries from aplanned political union treaty. France is hoping that thetreaty will include a strong statement about the EC's goal ofdeveloping a role in Western defense. Mr. Mitterrand saidNATO would continue to play a key role, but that more roomshould be made for the EC. Indeed, the new strategic plan isthe first ever to be signed by France.   There never was much risk that NATO would disappear. NoEuropean country is planning to spend huge new sums onbuilding up separate forces from those they have committed toNATO. Indeed, each country is planning to reduce its force,and the EC's foray into military matters will depend on theequipment and the expertise of NATO &quot;for years to come,&quot; aDutch official said.   But underscoring the changed political climate in Europe,alliance members are preparing to issue a statement expandingcooperation with the nations of Central and Eastern Europe.Those links are intended to lend Western expertise fordefense planning, civilian-military relations, and conversionof defense industries to civilian uses.   The U.S. and its allies are prepared eventually to welcomethe former Warsaw Pact adversaries as full NATO members. Buta senior U.S. official said that because of &quot;their embryonicstatus as democracies,&quot; they aren't yet ready for that step.   The &quot;new strategic concept&quot; for the alliance was the firstsuch strategy statement ever made public, further evidencethat NATO is quickly becoming more a forum for managingcooperation rather than conflict. It replaces the &quot;flexibleresponse&quot; dating back to 1967, which defined how NATO wouldfight a nuclear war against a monolithic Soviet militarymachine. This time around, however, nuclear forces weredeclared &quot;essentially political: to preserve peace andprevent coercion and any kind of war.&quot;   At today's meeting, the 16 leaders will sign the &quot;RomeDeclaration,&quot; which will be, Mr. De Michelis said, &quot;like anew birthday&quot; for NATO. The leaders will call on the SovietUnion to maintain control over its vast nuclear arsenal, andsubscribe to policies &quot;that can help guide theirtransformation into becoming constructive members of thelarger Euro-Atlantic Community,&quot; according to Secretary ofState James Baker.   The 12 EC foreign ministers also will decide here aboutthe next steps in trying to cajole Yugoslavia into stoppingits civil war. German Chancellor Kohl is pushing for ECrecognition of the breakaway republics as independent states.He is also urging his EC counterparts to impose tougheconomic sanctions on Serbia, which has refused to go alongwith the EC-sponsored peace plan. NATO is expected to lendits support to the EC plan.</TEXT></DOC>
