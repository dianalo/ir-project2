 Case inpoint: R:BASE 3.0.andP;  The $795 package from Microrim now supports full ANSI 2SQL, offers multiuser auto-refresh and extensive new relational facilities,and has a completely new user-friendly interface.andM;While the new R:BASE interface is character-mode only, it's fully mouseable,with pulldown, shadowed menus and list boxes.andP;  The older Prompt By Exampleand &quot;Randgt;&quot; prompt command mode are still available, but the new interface ismore logical, accessible, and consistent.andP;  Including touches borrowed fromflat-file databases like Reflex (such as field selection list boxes), it alsooffers a better placement of function keys and on-line help.andP;  While the mouseresponse could be snappier, you'll find R:BASE easier to use than everbefore.andM;Form, report, and label generation have been improved in R:BASE.andP;  You canstill create custom forms and reports, but you can also generate quickversions from a single table.andP;  R:BASE forms allow you to attach command filesto field entry and exit points, as well as customize field-level help text.andO;Reports can be previewed on-screen, and it's easy to incorporate a variety ofembedded print styles in both reports and labels.andM;Microrim has improved R:BASE's networking facilities, too, with anauto-refresh facility that updates displayed data that other users havechanged.andP;  While Paradox will automatically refresh displayed records, itwon't let more than one user edit a record simultaneously.andP;  R:BASE does allowthis activity, and when you save the changes to a record, R:BASE will notifyyou if the changes conflict with those made by someone else.andP;  It th en givesyou the choice to accept the other person's changes and discard your own, oryou can simply overwrite them.andM;The R:BASE Query facility is now full Query-By-Example (QBE), and it makesquery building a cinch.andP;  You can toggle between QBE and data browsing, orformat several aspects of the Query screen and results: column order, width,position, and color as well as whether columns are displayed.andP;  The QBEinterface visually resembles the one found in Paradox; but unlike Paradox,R:BASE can save a query as a relationahl VIEW, letting you (or yourapplications) open the VIEW to access only the rows and columns restrieved inthe saved query.andM;Indeed, R:BASE's extensive support for relational VIEWs and ANI 2 SQL withtransaction processing puts it in the big leagues of relational databases.andO;Rather than scattering database objects (such as tables, reports, queries,and views) around your disk, R:BASE maintains a DB2-style system catalog andorganizes everything in databases.andP;  When you open a database, all its objectsare available.andP;  The DBMS allows you to incorporate data integrity rules intothe database.andP;  By using these to control data access and validate data entry,a developer can prevent users from using the interactive interface to goaround data integrity constraints ordinarily created at the applicationlevel.andM;The interface also sports a nice set of relational tools to let you takeadvantage of major relational operations without knowing SQL.andP;  You can useINSERT to add rows of one table or view to another, JOIN two tables to createa new one, INTERSECT and UNION to combine tables that have a common column,or use SUBTRACT to retreive the set of rows that differ in one table fromanother.andM;On the programming front, R:BASE offers severl new commands and functions,and embedded SQL has been tightly integrated into the R:BASE programminglanguage.andP;  The latter makes it easy to rely on SQL for data retrieval andmanipulation; the command language continues to control the interface anddrive the application.andP;  While these facilities are well worth having, they'renot without a small price.andP;  Existing databases and applications have to beconverted to run under R:BASE 3.0.andP;  However, conversion facilities for bothare supplied.andM;In general, R:BASE 3.0's performance is not as good as R:BASE for DOS.andP;  Onthe PC Labs benchmark tests, the IMPORT test ran 30 percent slower and theSORT test ran 18 to 27 percent slower than it did under R:BASE for DOS.andO;While the percentage difference in the SEARCH tests for the two DBMSs waslarge, the SEARCH benchmark test still completed in only a few seconds oneither database.andP;  Finally, R:BASE 3.0's support for relational VIEWs allowsit to dramatically reduce the time required for the DELETE columns test.andO;Since the purpose of this benchmark test is to check a DBMS's ability toaccess a subset of table columns as a table in its own right.andP;  R:BASE 3.0used a VIEW to cut this task's time to a few seconds.andM;Since R:BASE 3.0 fully integrates ANSI SQL and embraces the relationaldatabase model, developers should take a good look at R:BASE when planningnew applications.andP;  That, along with its improved interface and expandedoutput facilities should make it more appealing to end users, too.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
