(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>For many computer users, UNIX holds the promise of more efficient networkingand support for more powerful applications.andP;  But the operating system'scryptic commands-and the thought of turning a shelf full of expensive andfamiliar DOS applications into fireplace fodder-has kept many a DOS user onthe UNIX sidelines.andM;Into the DOS-UNIX fray has come Bull HN Information Systems Inc. TheBillerica, Mass.based division of the $6.5 billion European conglomerate,Groupe Bull SA, has introduced a line of workstations that run UNIX and DOSapplications in their own windows simultaneously, on the same screen.andM;The new DPX/ProStation line runs under the Santa Cruz Operation Inc.'s (SCO)UNIX System V release 3.2.andP;  SCO UNIX is the leading UNIX flavor for personalcomputers built around the Intel 80386 and 80486 microprocessors.andP;  Themultitasking operating system is based on ATandamp;T's UNIX System V release 3.andO;Bull has taken SCO's Open Desktop, a graphical user interface thatincorporates the X Windows and Motif standards, and modified it to run withapplications packaged with the workstations.andM;For DOS users, the most important modification Bull has made to Open Desktopis the addition of Merge Software, developed by Locus Computing Corp. Mergelets DOS software run side by side with UNIX applications.andP;  It also lets UNIXand DOS applications run on a single screen in multiple windows.andM;Another feature, the Bull Professional Environment, does Microsoft Windowsone better in its use of icons: not only do applications have distinctiveicons, but individual file types do, as well.andP;  A memo icon looks like a memo,a file icon looks like a file, etc.andP;  In addition, common operations, such asprint, send, copy and delete, can be accessed from any icon.andP;  The interfacecan be used in two modes.andP;  The administrator mode provides users with the rawUNIX command line; the professional mode's graphical interface isolates usersfrom it.andP;  Users can switch between modes.andM;The company has bundled database, desktop-publishing, spreadsheet andelectronic mail applications with the systems.andP;  These applications include:andM;* Poste, an electronic mail system from Alfalfa Software Inc.;andM;* FrameMaker, desktop-publishing software from Frame Technology Corp.;andM;* Informix Software Inc.'s Wingz graphical spreadsheet; andandM;* Ingres Corp.'s Ingres relational database.andM;Bull offers two DPX/ProStation models, each built around Intel's 80486microprocessor, running at 25 megahertz.andP;  The $12,995 model 25i is based onthe Micro Channel Architecture (MCA) and includes one expansion slot.andP;  The$13,495 model 25e is based on the Extended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA) and includes two expansion slots.andP;  Both models include a 1.44 megabyte3 1/2 inch floppy disk drive, 8MB of internal memory, a 213MB hard disk and a16-inch high-resolution color monitor.andM;The company is looking for big sales of the DPX/ProStation to come from usersinterested in commercial applications, not the more traditional technicalUNIX apps.andP;  Kurt Hartman, manager of workstation marketing for Bull, says theworkstation is aimed at companies that want to move their power users to aUNix environment.andP;  &quot;We're looking at departments of large corporations whowant to give their workers the power of UNIX but can't afford to give each ofthem a $20,000 workstation.andP;  These users are computer literate enough to getthe job done, but they don't know UNIX.&quot;andM;Hartman says the market for the Dpx/ProStation with UNIX is like the earlyMac market-geared toward people who need to be productive, but who don't havetime to learn an operating system.andM;That's exactly what the market wants, says analyst Wayne Kernochan of theYankee Group market research firm in Boston.andP;  &quot;It's as good an answer as Ihave found for tying DOS and UNIX apps together,&quot; he says.andP;  But he alsoquestions whether Bull-fresh off a round of layoffs and cutbacks-has themarket clout to make the ProStation a big seller.andM;&quot;Bull may feel pressure to drop the price if they are to compete against thehigh-end PCs,&quot; says senior consultant Tom Moore of International Data Corp.andO;in Framingham, Mass.andP;  Moore believes there is room in the market for theProStation.andP;  &quot;There are enough LINIX/DOS/Macintosh mixed networks out therethat users are looking for better network integration and sharing ofapplications.andP;  Products like this can do that,&quot; says Moore.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
