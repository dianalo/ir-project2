Sease (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> MON ECO STK BON </IN><TEXT>   Demoralized investors, mulling prospects of stepped-up inflation and rising interest rates, pushed stock and bond prices sharply lower.    Already reeling from Tuesday's decline that followed news of an unexpectedly narrow March trade deficit, markets were hit with fresh waves of selling yesterday.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 35.32 to 1951.09. Government bond prices dropped more than 3/4 of a point, or $7.50 for every $1,000 in face value, pushing the yield on some long-term Treasury bonds to nearly 9.4%. The dollar also fell, after gaining Tuesday on news of the narrower trade deficit.    The economic news wasn't upbeat yesterday, but neither was it startling. Former White House economist Martin Feldstein repeated his warning that the dollar will fall to 116 yen by year's end and to 100 yen over the next three years.    Meanwhile, the Commodity Research Bureau's index of futures prices, a widely watched indicator of inflationary trends, gained steadily through the afternoon to end at 242.90, its highest level since April 1985.    Analysts said the past two days' sharp drops in stocks and bonds reflected a realization among investors that correcting imbalances in the U.S. economy won't be easy. The report on the March trade balance set the stage for that realization, they said, when investors found inflation lurking in the prospect of a narrower deficit.    The deficit shrank to $9.75 billion from $13.83 billion in February. But the improvement came from a record level of exports, not a decline in imports.    The boom in exports, coupled with a report that U.S. factory operating rates were near 83% in April, suggested that the economy is strong enough for prices to begin rising rapidly. And as much as stock and bond investors hate inflation, they also dislike the alternative -- the Federal Reserve raising interest rates to cool the economy.    &quot;The basic view is that something has to give to make room for big improvements in the trade balance,&quot; said Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International Corp. &quot;The market is saying that one way or another, there's got to be a decline in real income, either through slower domestic growth or higher inflation.&quot;    In the bond market the mood &quot;is pretty ugly,&quot; said John R. Burrus, president and chief executive officer of CRT Government Securities Ltd., New York. One of the problems, he said, is that &quot;the dollar hasn't been able to hold its gains.&quot;    A lower dollar could dissuade foreign investors from increasing their holdings of dollar-denominated investments. Analysts also worry that a lower dollar will add to inflation by raising prices on imported goods.    &quot;We haven't seen a lot of selling,&quot; Mr. Burrus said, &quot;but the tone of the market is just so awful out there.&quot;    Stock market professionals were stunned by the pessimistic response that investors gave the trade report. Many of them had counted on a big stock-price rally if the March deficit came in under $10 billion. Now about all they can see are further price declines.    &quot;There was grave disappointment in the action on those trade figures,&quot; said John Burnett, a trader at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp. &quot;If you can't get a rally out of those numbers, then the only way left to go is down.&quot;    But several analysts said investors are overreacting to the inflation and interestrate implications of the trade report.    &quot;The inflation vigilantes are out hanging people,&quot; said Barton Biggs, an investment strategist at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. &quot;The ultimate irony is that the good news was too good.&quot;    Kenneth Hackle, a money manager in Fort Lee, N.J., said investors are letting their fears get in the way of rational analysis.    &quot;Structurally, the market is sound,&quot; he said, &quot;but when you look at investor psychology, it's about as sound as New York City bridges.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
