Seeking an infant to adopt, the Sacramento, Calif.,husband and wife pooled some money with several otherprospective adoptive couples to buy an ad in USA Today's&quot;Life&quot; section.</LP><TEXT>   The ad told women with unplanned pregnancies about &quot;open&quot;adoption, in which the two sets of parents get to know eachother. A 26-year-old Georgia woman read the ad and responded.A few months later, Ms. Quillin and Mr. Hosinski adopted herbaby.   Under the laws of some 20 U.S. states, publishing thiskind of ad is illegal, although offenders are rarelyprosecuted. Now a California adoption center is seeking tochange that state's law restricting adoption ads, claiming itimpedes a constitutionally protected communication of adesire to adopt.   At a time when advertising has spread into just aboutevery corner of America -- from law to medicine to toplessmodels -- some people believe advertising for babiesrepresents a border that should never be crossed. &quot;It's likeopening a bazaar, and children are the product,&quot; says JimBrown, chief of adoptions for California's department ofsocial services.   Yet proponents of adoption advertising say they're onlydisseminating a message that otherwise gets short shrift inthe public debate about birth control and abortion. &quot;We'renot forcing anyone to call us,&quot; says Bruce Rappaport,executive director of the Independent Adoption Center inPleasant Valley, Calif. &quot;We just want to make sure women knowthe choice exists. We're doing what the state and federalgovernments won't do -- funding adoption education.&quot;   In some states, including California, licensed agenciesalone can place adoption ads; attorneys, individuals orunlicensed agencies are barred from ad pages. In otherstates, advertising for babies by anyone is strictlyforbidden.   Yet even in states with rigid rules about such ads,regulators say the ads constantly crop up in local andregional newspapers. The regulators then call or write to thenewspapers, reminding them of the state's law, which usuallycurtails the practice -- at least temporarily. Ads innational publications like USA Today, which estimates it runssome 500 a year, are technically illegal in some states, butare mostly ignored by regulators. Us and Rolling Stonemagazines, with their youthful demographics, also publishsuch ads.   The people who oppose such advertising worry thatprospective adoptive parents will vie for scarce healthywhite infants by pitching their life style as though it werea competitive product. &quot;Have large Victorian home, two lazycats, in a neighborhood filled with playmates. Summerweekends at lakeside mountain camp, with doting grandparentsand cousins to play with,&quot; read one recent ad in USA Today.&quot;$$ Security, books/music, outdoor sports, holidays withfamily and LOVE,&quot; read another.   Mr. Brown, the California adoptions chief, says he'sconcerned that a pregnant woman might read about and chooseone couple, then another and another, leaving a trail ofbereavement behind her.   &quot;Someone runs an ad saying `Two Harvard-educatedphysicians are seeking an infant,'&quot; says Mr. Brown. &quot;A birthmother says okay. Then someone runs an ad saying, `TwoHarvard-educated physicians with Oxford postgraduatefellowships . . . .' The woman says, `That's even better.' Wesee things like that now. Imagine what we'd see without thelaw.&quot;   About 40% of the inquiries Diane Michelsen, a Californiaadoption attorney, gets from prospective birth mothers comefrom advertising, according to a recent book, &quot;An OpenAdoption,&quot; by Lincoln Caplan. Ms. Michelsen, in an interview,confirmed that she advertises in college towns and areas withhigh unemployment and tries not to advertise in places wherethere has just been a catastrophe, such as a tornado orhurricane. She also tries to advertise in places where thephysical characteristics of the native population might matchthose of some prospective adoptive parents -- for tall,Scandinavian-looking couples, for example, she mightadvertise in Minnesota and Wisconsin.   &quot;I love advertising -- I think it's a real appropriate wayto get people together,&quot; says Ms. Michelsen. &quot;But it's truethat there are more attempted scams through advertising thanany other way of connecting birth mother and adoptiveparents.&quot;   Although in many states licensed agencies have the rightto advertise their services, most agencies that advertise atall do so cautiously and conservatively, concentrating on theYellow Pages.   One exception is a Cherry Hill, N.J., adoption agencycalled the Golden Cradle, which has advertised not only inthe Yellow Pages, but also on billboards, bus benches,television, radio and in the classified pages. When theagency first decided to advertise about 10 years ago, saysMarlene Piasecki, the agency's executive director, the YellowPages wouldn't accept the ads even though they had a categoryfor abortion services.   &quot;There was a tremendous uproar when we startedadvertising,&quot; says Ms. Piasecki. &quot;But our founder was anentrepreneur, and he thought some of the same principles thatmake an effective business could also make an effective humanservice. People said, `That means you're selling a baby.' Wesaid, `No, we're offering a service, and sometimes it ends upwith an adoption taking place.'&quot;   In Kentucky, which has one of the highest out-of-wedlockbirth rates in the country, not even licensed agencies areallowed to advertise for babies. &quot;It seems like a terriblyrisky way to find adoptive homes for children,&quot; says SueHoward, adoption specialist for the state. Ms. Howard saysshe herself approached USA Today to inform the paper that theadvertising it was carrying violated Kentucky law. &quot;Someonein the classified section told me, `Oh, we don't bother withstate laws,'&quot; says Ms. Howard, who referred the matter to thestate attorney general's office.   A USA Today spokesman says the paper tries to protectchildren with its strict guidelines about who can publish theads and what they say.   But to Pam Quillin and Rob Hosinski, a classified ad endedfive years of sadness and frustration and brought them adaughter named Caitlin. &quot;I called the county about adoption,and they wouldn't even put my name on a list to get on alist,&quot; says Ms. Quillin. Meanwhile, in Georgia, Caitlin'sbirth mother had herself been frustrated by the attitude of alocal agency, which urged her to give up any concerns aboutthe fate of her baby.   &quot;I would never presume to tell someone what to do about anunplanned pregnancy,&quot; Ms. Quillin says. &quot;But young women tendnot even to consider adoption. Advertising is a way ofletting them know it's there.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
