South Africa claimed the South-West Africa People's Organizationfighters had violated the U.N. plan under which it is ending its74-year rule of Namibia.   SWAPO leaders denied guerrillas involved in the fighting nearthe Angolan border had crossed into Namibia and criticized U.N.adminstrators for agreeing to let South African troops reinforcepolice battling the guerrillas.   ``Our people are being butchered under the United Nationsflag,'' said SWAPO Foreign Secretary Theo-Ben Gurirab, accusingSouth African forces of initiating the fighting.   Namibian police say at least 161 rebels and 19 police have diedin the fighting that began Saturday, when a formal cease-fire wasto have begun. They said the fighting continued today.   Under the U.N.-brokered independence accord, all guerrillas areto remain in Angola at least 100 miles north of Namibia's borderuntil mid-May.   But diplomats said the SWAPO guerrillas apparently felt theywere entitled under the accord to set up bases inside Namibia underU.N. supervision just as the South Africans, whom they have beenfighting for 23 years.   Whether SWAPO should be allowed in Namibia has been acontentious question in the independence process.   The report on the situation by investigators led by the U.N.special representative for Angola, Martti Ahtisaari of Finland, wasrelayed to Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, who briefedSecurity Council members on Monday, said three Western diplomatswho spoke on condition of anonymity.   The diplomats said the report, presented in an atmosphere ofunusual secrecy, concluded that up to 1,000 guerrillas infiltratednorthern Namibia but that their motive was unclear. Its detailswere not disclosed.   Black African diplomats were outraged.   ``There can never be any question of infiltration, these areNamibians,'' said Zambian Ambassador Peter Zuze.   South Africa has accused the rebels of infiltrating in anattempt to set up bases, an option that was rejected during 10years of U.N. negotiations on terms of the Namibian independenceplan.   Some U.N. diplomats said they believed many rebels misunderstoodthe terms of the cease-fire and peace plan and thought they couldsafely march home to Namibia bearing their weapons.   Others accepted South Africa's claim that the rebel leadershipsent the guerrillas in to establish base camps in a bid to havethem put under U.N. supervision just as South African troops are tobe confined to barracks.   Diplomats said Ahtisaari's report did not attempt to assignmotives for the border crossing.   Gurirab insisted the guerrillas always had been in Namibia andcriticized U.N. administrators in Namibia for allowing SouthAfrican troops to reinforce the territorial police.   ``The president of SWAPO (Sam Nujoma), on March 29, issued adirective to SWAPO combatants in Namibia to make contact with (U.N.peacekeepers) for purposes of being confined to base,'' he said.   Since armed rebels troops are obviously in Namibia, saidGurirab, ``It would make sense, and it would serve everybody'sinterest if they would be confined to base and monitored by (U.N.observers).''   Gurirab criticized U.N. officials who allowed the deployment of1,500 South African troops to back up Namibian police, but did notname names.   ``It's a very ugly, ugly sin. I think you all know that therehas been a longstanding bloody conflict between South Africanforces and our forces, and for the U.N. to pretend that SouthAfrica is an impartial, disinterested party in this conflict is, tosay the lest, most preposterous,'' said Gurirab.   Perez de Cuellar said the fighting did not mean the peace planis failing, adding that most of the 4,650 U.N. troops planned forthe mission are not yet on the scene. Only about 1,000 U.N. troopshave been deployed.   ``We have 300 men in the northern part of the area. You cannotsay it is a failure,'' Perez de Cuellar said.   SWAPO, South Africa and Angola said Monday that they remaincommitted to the U.N. plan, which calls for Nov. 1 electionsleading to independence early next year.   Besides independence for Namibia, the plan calls for thewithdrawal of Cuban troops who have been helping the Marxistgovernment in Angola fight South Africa-backed rebels.</TEXT></DOC>
