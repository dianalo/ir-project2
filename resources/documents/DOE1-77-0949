Such cogeneration plantsshould burn imported oil and LNG, and should serve to supply heat aswell. Large-scale centralized systems such as clear power plants andsmall-scale distributed systems such as cogeneration plants have theirspecific disadvantages each other. It is expected that people in thenext century will hope for diversified forms of energy supply, such asvarying voltages and frequencies to meet specific purposes, in orderto secure comfortable life. Demands for various forms of D.C. power willalso increase. Cogeneration seems to be a promising means for energysupply in such an area. (7 figs, 2 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
