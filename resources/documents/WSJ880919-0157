The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said it closed Ultimate Savings Bank, Richmond, Va., and sold its insured deposits to Citizens Federal Savings Bank, a unit of Citizens Savings Financial Corp., a Miami-based thrift-holding company with assets of about $3.5 billion.    Citizens paid $8 million, or about 4.27% of insured deposits, to take over the deposits, the Bank Board said. Citizens, which has operations in Florida, California and Ohio, said the transaction will give it entry into the Virginia market.    In recent years Ultimate, which until recently was known as Cardinal Savings andamp; Loan, launched &quot;an aggressive acquisition and development program&quot; through its Cardian Mortgage Corp. mortgage-banking unit and began a nationwide lending program financed by brokered funds and highcost jumbo certificates of deposit, the board said.    As of July 31, the board said, Ultimate had assets of $192.5 million, liabilities of $221.6 million, total deposits of $188.9 million and negative regulatory capital of $29 million.    Separately, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said it closed Capital National Bank, a Fort Worth, Texas, bank with one office and assets of $24.6 million. It said the bank's sole office opened Friday as a branch of Central Bank andamp; Trust, Fort Worth.    The FDIC also said it agreed to contribute $4.3 million to prevent the failure of Guaranty National Bank, an Austin, Texas, bank with assets of about $22 million. It said the bank and its parent, Central Texas Bancshares Inc., are being acquired by an investor group headed by David Hartman, an El Paso, Texas, businessman. The investor group will provide an additional capital injection of $2.4 million.    The FDIC said it acted after being notified by the senior deputy Comptroller of the Currency that Guaranty National was in danger of failing. </TEXT></DOC>
