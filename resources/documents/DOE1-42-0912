They have used localization techniques based onthe rotating-frame imaging experiment and carried out the double-surfacecoil probe. Information is obtained from selected slices by rotating-framedepth selection and from a complete one-dimensional spectroscopic imageusing phase-modulated rotating-frame imaging. The methods collect biochemicalinformation from metabolites in human heart, and they use the fact thatthe phosphocreatine/ATP molar ratio in skeletal muscle at rest is higherthan that in working heart to demonstrate that localization ha been achievedfor each investigation. The phosphocreatine/ATP molar ratio in normalhuman heart has been measured as 1.55 +/- 0.20 in six subjects usingdept selection and as 1.53 +/- 0.25 in four subjects using spectroscopicimaging. Measurement of this ratio is expected to give a useful and reproducibleindex of myocardial energetics in normal and pathological states.</TEXT></DOC>
