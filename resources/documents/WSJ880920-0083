Appearing at a privately sponsored conference on financial markets attended by government officials, economists and business leaders, Mr. Ball said investor confidence in securities markets has been eroded by the 1987 stock market crash, insider-trading scandals and a rash of corporate raiding.    To dampen fears of excessive price volatility related to such developments, new regulatory curbs should be placed on index futures-related trading strategies, and &quot;tax constraints&quot; should be imposed on securities markets to dampen the increasingly speculative nature of trading taking place there, Mr. Ball said.    &quot;You hear about 'players' in the 'game,'&quot; Mr. Ball said, referring to expressions increasingly creeping into commentary about financial markets. He deplored such characterizations, asserting that it isn't a &quot;game,&quot; but rather the process by which U.S. industry raises fresh capital.    Mr. Ball said a favorable differential should be restored for the taxation of long-term capital gains, perhaps taking that rate down to 15%, and at the same time, a surtax should be applied to short-term gains, levying a tax at a rate 5% above the level applicable to ordinary income.    Such a levy would no doubt have a dampening effect on risk-arbitrage trading and all types of takeover-related stock accumulation. For its part, Prudential-Bache isn't considered a major power in the takeover community.    A flat rate of 5% should also be applied to the short-term trading profits of tax-exempt institutions, such as pension funds, he added.    Mr. Ball also said brokers and others should be required to disclose to the Securities and Exchange Commission within a 30-day period the names of all parties participating in a corporate takeover attempt by means of a tender offer. </TEXT></DOC>
