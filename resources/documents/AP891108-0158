Krenz, after just three weeks as Communist Party chief, threw outthe aging Politburo on Wednesday and replaced the ruling body withreform proponents. But some said Krenz himself could be oustedunless he seizes the initiative.   The conservative West German newspaper Die Welt compared Krenzand his men with the crew of a sinking ship.   ``Water is breaking in everywhere through the rotting planks,''the newspaper said in an editorial. ``They are grasping ateverything to stop the leaks.''   Hans-Jochen Vogel, the leader of the West German leftistopposition Social Democrats, stressed the urgent need for democraticreforms.   ``A German Democratic Republic that is bleeding to death, whosesupply system is breaking down and whose economy is failing won't beable to reform at all,'' Vogel told Parliament. ``It will sink intolethargy or even chaos.''   There were questions about whether the Politburo shakeup would beenough to keep East Germany from veering out of control, especiallysince Krenz has insisted the Communist Party keep its leading rolein society.   ``Just changing a few faces is not enough,'' said Volker Ruehe,the general secretary of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's ChristianDemocratic Party. ``The new politics has to take into account whatthe people of (East Germany) want _ and that is an end to theCommunist Party's monopoly on power.''   Backed by the United States, West Germany and other countries,the opposition has called for free elections.   A leader of an East German political party allied with theCommunists demanded a constitutional change to revoke theCommunists' monopoly on power and urged free elections.   ``We have seen that the current constitutional basis can'tprotect the country from instability,'' said Liberal DemocraticParty vice chairman Hans-Dieter Raspe.   Another allied party, the National Democrats, demanded Krenz give``proof of ability to lead.''   Krenz, hounded by a lack of support among East Germans, hasbecome a target of ridicule among the hundreds of thousands ofpeople who have taken to the streets to demand democracy.   ``Grandmother, why do you have such long teeth?'' read oneplacard at Saturday's million-strong demonstration in East Berlin _with a leering, grinning Krenz replacing the wolf of the Little RedRiding Hood fairy tale.   Most East Germans watch West German TV, which has given amplecoverage to the democratic changes sweeping Poland and Hungary.   ``Krenz just doesn't enjoy any trust,'' said Christian Schreiber,an East Berlin dental technician who joined one of Europe's largestsingle post-war migrations by fleeing to Bavaria with his wife andchild last weekend.   As the number of refugees approaches 200,000, there is growingconfusion for those left behind.   There is ``mental chaos'' as ordinary East Germans are tornbetween staying and fleeing to the West, said Josef Janning of theUniversity of Mainz.   ``The East Germans are confused about their identity,'' Janningsaid. The life they were accustomed to ``is breaking down'' withevery departure.   ``Suddenly they are forced to make a decision: Do I head to theWest or don't I?'' Janning said. ``It's one thing to dream about hownice it would be to visit the West and live there. It's another tobe asked by your own children, `Do we go or do we stay?'''   For ordinary East Germans, there are the daily inconveniences ofstores shut down because workers have fled, and the anxiety ofknowing that the flight to the West has stripped the country ofhundreds of its doctors and nurses. Opposition leaders note thecountry is losing the equivalent of a village every day as EastGermans turn their backs on the Communist system.   ``The people of East Germany have unmistakably shown they won'tbe satisfied with cosmetic improvements,'' said Dorothee Wilms, theBonn cabinet minister in charge of relations between the two Germannations.   Janning said ``Krenz is not a reform type,'' and warned that thenew leader could be ousted within months if he fails to seize theinitiative.   Klaus Boelling, the former head of Bonn's diplomatic mission inEast Berlin, said the Politburo resignations were a sign of ``totalhelplessness and powerlessness'' and predicted they would fail tostabilize the growing crisis.   ``I urgently wish that Krenz, in the interest of millions of EastGermans, would realize that he doesn't enjoy confidence at all inhis own country,'' Boelling told Saarland state radio.</TEXT></DOC>
