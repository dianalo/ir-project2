The case, involving the Du Pont plant in Deepwater, N.J.,could have broad implications for U.S. corporate managers whoare increasingly turning to such workplace groups to solveproblems jointly and improve product delivery.</LP><TEXT>   In the Du Pont case, the federal labor agency claims thecompany violated labor laws when it created eleven committeescomprised of workers and supervisors to resolve workplaceissues at the company's largest chemical plant. The laborrelations board said the committees violate the labor lawsbecause they constitute employer-dominated labororganizations.   &quot;We intend to comply fully with the NLRB Act, and webelieve our practices will be upheld during a hearing,&quot; saysBruce R. Fitzgerald, unit manager of human resources at theplant, in a statement. A hearing is set for June 10 before anadministrative law judge.   The complaint is the result of a yearlong investigationbegun by the board after the local Chemical WorkersAssociation filed charges of unfair labor practices. InDecember 1989, an administrative law judge ruled that adesign team comprised of supervisors and workers at the plantconstituted an employer-dominated labor organization. Ratherthan appeal that decision, Du Pont, based in Wilmington,Del., disbanded that committee. The union then broughtcharges against the other committees, which dealt with suchissues as health and safety.   Workplace groups, design teams and labor-management groupsare different names for what labor specialists say is agrowing phenomenon among U.S. businesses. Joseph Boyett, amanager of the consulting group A.T. Kearney Inc., and anauthor of a book on the subject, says the groups are designedto improve product quality, worker productivity and morale.   &quot;For many executives, this is not a strategic issue, it isa survival issue for the 1990s. Unless significant leaps aremade in the quality of services, there is a question whethera company will survive,&quot; says Mr. Boyett.   According to the Association for Quality andParticipation, an educational and research group that studiesthe issue, approximately 30,000 organizations haveimplemented employee involvement programs, including the U.S.Postal Service and Motorola Inc.   The leadership of the United Auto Workers, the UnitedSteelworkers of America and the Communications Workers ofAmerica have all backed such groups at plant sites across theU.S. But Mr. Boyett says that &quot;there is a whole segment ofthe labor community that sees these programs as a tremendousthreat&quot; because they attempt to change the adversarial natureof management-labor relations.   William Golt, president of the 2,000-member ChemicalWorkers Association, which filed the charges, says that DuPont had attempted to use the committees to weaken the union.He says that at the same time the company was dealing withthe groups on health and safety issues, it was refusing tobargain with the union over demands for workplaceimprovements.   At the heart of the dispute is the question of whenworkplace groups are legal. Under the National LaborRelations Act, employers are barred from giving financial orother support to a labor organization. But employment lawyerssay the interpretation of the law remains unclear.   Some federal appeals courts and the NLRB have ruled basedon whether a company had union-busting in mind when it set upthe workplace groups. But there are rulings that refused toconsider such intentions. Theodore M. Lieverman, theHaddonfield, N.J., lawyer for the union, says that acompany's intentions are irrelevant under the law, and thatthe committees are illegal without union approval.   The labor relations board has indicated that it will amendthe complaint to include additional allegations made by theunion of bad-faith bargaining during contract negotiations.Mr. Fitzgerald, the Du Pont manager, says the company had 38meetings and spent more than 100 hours bargaining with theunion before implementing any changes. &quot;We believe that wefulfilled our bargaining obligation, and that there wasvirtually no hope of reaching agreement with the union,&quot; hesays.   ---   CALIFORNIANS WHO LIE about smoking habit may lose lifeinsurance.   Resolving a dispute between Old Line Life Insurance Co.and a woman who had claimed on her life-insurance applicationthat she was a nonsmoker, a California appeals court ruledthe insurer doesn't have to pay on the policy.   The 3-0 ruling by the First District Court of Appeals, thefirst decision in California on the issue, cited a state lawsaying an insurance policy can be rescinded because ofmaterial misrepresentations or omissions.   The court's decision adds to a group of similar rulings invarious other states, including New York, New Jersey andPennsylvania. The rulings extend longstanding precedents thatlife insurance applicants who lie about their medicalhistories can have their policies voided.   In the California case, the court ruled that Old Line LifeInsurance Co., a unit of USLife Corp., New York, could refuseto pay the policy even if the company might have issuedinsurance to a smoker at a higher rate.   The case involves Imogene Silvera, who took out a $250,000life insurance policy in 1985 with Old Line Life. Ms. Silveradied of breast cancer in December 1986. After investigatingthe case, Old Line Life denied payment on the policy becauseMs. Silvera was a smoker. Lawrence Graham, general counselfor Old Line Life Insurance, said that had the insurancecompany known Ms. Silvera was a smoker, her premium wouldhave been doubled and &quot;we might not have issued her a policyat all.&quot;   An attorney representing Ms. Silvera's trust couldn't bereached for comment on the ruling.   ---   NOTED: Andrea Sheridan Ordin, former California chiefassistant attorney general, is joining the Los Angeles officeof Pepper, Hamilton andamp; Scheetz, a Philadelphia-based law firm.Ms. Ordin, 51, also a former U.S. Attorney in the CentralDistrict of California, will head Pepper Hamilton's 27-memberlitigation department in Los Angeles.</TEXT></DOC>
