<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-78-0733 </DOCNO><TEXT>The first 8 months have been used mainly to design and develop equipment.After carefully exploring various sensing technologies we have optedfor measuring the minute displacements involved in the Q measurementsby optical interferometry. The reason for this decision stems only partlyfrom our prejudice (because of our experience) toward optics, but moreimportantly from the inherent calibration when using laser light of aknown wavelength. We have further developed the optical parts and theelectronics of our high precision interferometer, having reached thesensitivity needed for our measurements. In adapting this technologyto a high pressure and high temperature environment we explored the useof optical fibers and constructed a single mode fiber interferometerand introduced an optical fiber into a high-pressure environment. Theinterferometer functioned satisfactorily and the high-pressure feedthroughfailed at 300 MPa, 3 times the value of the pressure at which we expectto do our measurements.</TEXT></DOC>
