ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Takeover battles for retail companies, mostlydormant after the stock market crash, exploded into out-and-out warthis past week as R.H. Macy andamp; Co. Inc. and Campeau Corp. foughtover who will acquire Federated Department Stores Inc.   Macy and Campeau had competing tender offers for Federated'sstock, and although Macy and Federated signed a definitiveagreement, by week's end no one was sure who would win.   Federated, the nation's fifth-largest retailer, is a likelytakeover target. The company owns more than 650 department,specialty and discount stores and supermarkets, including theBloomingdale's, Burdine's, Lazarus and Bullock's department storechains.   Mergers and acquisitions in retailing and other industries weresharply curtailed after the Oct. 19 stock market collapse. Manypending takeover attempts were abandoned, including Dart GroupCorp.'s $6.62 billion bid for Dayton Hudson Corp., the nation'ssixth-largest retailer.   But several factors have combined to revitalize takeovers inmany business sectors.   ``Relatively low stock prices have lured companies into startingtender offers,'' said Peter Solomon, co-head of investment bankingfor Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.   Retail stock prices began to slip before the crash, and remaindepressed now because of sluggish consumer spending. A lower stockprice makes it easier for a prospective suitor to finance atakeover.   The lower dollar has made American companies a relative bargainfor foreigners, such as Australia's Hooker Corp. Ltd., which inrecent months has acquired B. Altman andamp; Co. in New York and SakowitzInc. in Houston.   There are political factors, too, including the upcomingpresidential election, said Monroe H. Greenstein, a retail industryanalyst for the investment firm Bear Stearns andamp; Co. Inc.   ``You have an administration here that has a very liberalinterpretation of antitrust laws, which means they're almost notenforced,'' said Greenstein.   No matter who succeeds Ronald Reagan in the White House, it isdoubtful the relaxed attitude will survive the change inadministrations, so many would-be acquirers want to buy companieswhile there is a more favorable climate, Greenstein said.   In addition, more and more states are passing anti-takeoverlaws, and investors want to make their acquisitions before itbecomes too difficult, he said.   For existing retail companies, buying another retailer meansimmediate growth. Solomon noted that few shopping centers are beingbuilt, which cuts down the opportunities for retailers to expand.Analysts see this as the primary reason for Macy's interest inFederated.   Greenstein cited another benefit of acquiring a retail company:real estate and store divisions that can be sold or mortgaged tohelp finance the acquisition.   When Campeau bought Allied Stores Corp. at the end of 1986, hesold 16 of its 24 store divisions to pay off loans taken out toacquire Allied. He has already announced he will sell Federated'sFoley's and Filene's divisions to the May Department Stores Co. ifhis tender offer is successful.   Campeau, a shopping center developer, is said to be interestedin Federated because many of its stores will provide him withimmediate access to malls.   One analyst sees the battle over Federated as havingramifications that could affect the direction of retailing foryears to come.   Whoever wins Federated ``would be sitting in the seat todetermine whether the major companies get larger or whether you'regoing to see entrepreneurs spurring growth in the industry,'' saidThomas Tashjian, who tracks retailers for Seidler Amdec SecuritiesInc. in Los Angeles.   Larger companies may not promote change, he said, adding,``You're going to end up seeing the same thing everywhere.''   When smaller companies or management groups buy retailers, theymay be more inclined to change and update stores, Tashjian said.   After Dillard Department Store Inc. bought the Joske'sdepartment store chain from Allied Stores, ``they improved theprofitability of those stores. They improved the customers'selection. They improved the pricing structure,'' Tashjian said.   Campeau said it had no plans to sell any Federated divisionsbeyond Foley's and Filene's, but their sale to May, the nation'sseventh-largest retailer, was bad news to Tashjian.   ``Filene's and Foley's, which have distinct franchises, maystart to look like a May-California or a Lord andamp; Taylor,'' two ofMay's other department store divisions, he said.   Macy is also a large retailer, but it is more likely thanCampeau to re-energize Federated's stores, having rejuvenated itsown stores, Tashjian said.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
