If recent history is a guide, the Fed will use its might and cunning to keep the growing bearish sentiment from trampling the dollar's value in the currency market. &quot;We view intervention as more as a psychological weapon than a blunt instrument to bludgeon the market,&quot; said a senior manager in the Fed's trading room during a reporter's recent visit. &quot;There are times when we'll be heavy handed. But we don't take the same posture all day long. We're trying to do as much as we can with as little funds as necessary. It is the taxpayer's money, after all.&quot;    Traders at commercial banks in New York who dealt directly with the U.S. central bank estimated the Fed's purchases Friday at between $50 million and $70 million. Traders said the intervention seemed intended to soothe fears of a dollar plunge, a concern that pushed U.S. stock prices sharply lower Thursday and Friday.    The U.S. has around $20 billion in foreign currency reserves at its disposal, according to recent data.    According to its own disclosures, the Fed bought $9.25 billion through foreign exchange market intervention last year, and purchased $715 million in January, all to help prop the dollar. These transactions were accomplished through sales of U.S. foreign currency reserves. The Bank of Japan, the West German Bundesbank and other major central banks also intervened heavily on the dollar's behalf in the period.    The Fed's currency trading traditionally is disclosed only months after the fact, and its officials generally don't talk to the press. On this occasion, interviews were conditioned on a grant of anonymity.    Most of the Fed's currency traders range in age from 22 to 32 years. Their department occupies a second floor corner of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's 64-year-old building, three blocks north of the New York Stock Exchange. The drab office is filled with nondescript furniture and dingy carpeting. But the huge octagonal desk that four women and three men sit around could be described as the world's largest poker table.    The workday begins in the Fed's trading room with the 5 a.m. arrival of the early-shift trader, who catches up on overnight activity in Asian and European trading centers. At the press of a button, the Fed's phones automatically dial up any of the central banks of Austria, Belgium, Britain, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland or West Germany.    At 7 a.m., the early trader gets a phone call from the Treasury Department's office of foreign exchange operations in Washington. James T. Lister, director of the office, usually places the call to get briefed on overnight market activity. &quot;These guys are our most important customers,&quot; says a Fed officer.    At 8 a.m., the rest of the traders arrive for work and at 8:30 one of them joins in a conference call with counterparts at 19 other central banks. Hardly a day passes without intervention by some central bank.    During the day, other Treasury officials may call for updates, and on rare occasions, Deputy Treasury Secretary David Mulford will telephone. Treasury Secretary James Baker hasn't been known to call the trading room, but Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and former Chairman Paul Volcker have telephoned for reports.    On occasions, pressures on the dollar have prompted managers in the trading room to telephone Mr. Greenspan for consultations about intervention.    Typically, high-level discussions between the Fed and the Treasury involve Sam Y. Cross, 60-year-old executive vice president and head of the Fed's foreign exchange operation, or Margaret L. &quot;Gretchen&quot; Greene, 45, the Fed's senior vice president of foreign exchange.    Since kicking off coordinated intervention with other central banks at the start of the year, the Fed has won greater respect from commercial bank traders it deals with. The Fed's intervention is more aggressive and sophisticated and less secretive than in the past, traders say. Previously, the Fed lacked the effectiveness of the West German Bundesbank or Bank of Japan, they add.    A currency dealer at a New York bank with a direct line to the Fed says that previously, &quot;when the Fed would come in, the dollar would almost always go against them. There was no sense of timing, no real sense of the market.&quot;    But Ian M. Spence, chief dealer at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York, says the Fed's style &quot;has changed dramatically.&quot; The Fed last fall asked banks how it could intervene more effectively. Now, the Fed traders seem to have more street sense and leeway from either the Treasury or the Fed's own bureaucracy to carry out intervention effectively, Mr. Spence says.    ---   Friday's Currency Activity   The dollar declined despite renewed central bank intervention.    In early trading in Tokyo Monday, the dollar was quoted at 124.65 yen, up from a low of 124.37 yen. The Bank of Japan reportedly was intervening.    The dollar was quoted at 125.05 yen in late New York trading Friday, down from 125.55 Thursday. The dollar also fell to 1.6720 West German marks, down from 1.6768 Thursday.    The Bank of Japan and the U.S. Federal Reserve intervened in Tokyo and New York, respectively, according to traders in both cities, buying dollars for yen. The central banks' objective, traders speculated, was to smooth out the dollar's fall and to defend the 125-yen level, at least for the time being.    The Bank of Japan bought as much as $200 million to $300 million for yen around the 125.50-yen level, traders in Tokyo said.    But the dollar continued to fall amid growing bearish sentiment. &quot;The stock market is down, bonds are weak, the condition of several U.S. banks remains shaky. That creates fundamental pressure on the dollar,&quot; one trader said. The trader added that with the Japanese economy growing at a healthy pace and the Tokyo stock market on a bull run, investing in Japan is more attractive than in the U.S.    In New York Commodity Exchange trading, gold for current delivery fell 80 cents to $453.30 an ounce.    Gold was quoted at $453.75 an ounce in early trading Monday in Hong Kong.    ---                      LATE NEW YORK TRADING                     Friday, March 25, 1988    Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
