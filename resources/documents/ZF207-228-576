(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Scanning the Color HorizonandM;You think you have scanning all figured out, eh?andP;  You've made the transitionfrom black and white to gray scale.andP;  You've learned all about pixel depth,brightness and contrast, sharpening and blurring, digital halftoning.andM;Don't get overconfident.andP;  Color's finally here.andP;  You thought 8 bits was hardto handle; now you have 24.andP;  And you must add hue, saturation, and brightnessto your desktop vocabulary.andM;Not only new words but also new problems arise when you enter the world ofscanned color images.andP;  For example, what you see on your screen, particularlyif you have an 8-bit display, may be a mere approximation of what you willget when you print to a color printer or do color separations to send to anoffset printer.andM;Some of the current crop of scanner and color-correction applications supportthe RasterOps 24-bit color format; others don't.andP;  Others won't support 24-bitcolor until Apple releases its new 32-bit Color QuickDraw software.andP;  What'smore, some of the software that comes with color scanners presents users withan interface that is more of an impediment than an aid to getting the jobdone.andP;  The results can be unexpected -- although the promise of colorscanning remains an enticement in the midst of its difficulties.andM;MacUser recently put half a dozen 24-bit color scanners through their paces.andO;We looked at two flatbeds, one from Truvel, the other from Sharp.andP;  Since theSharp scanning engine is also marketed by Howtek and New Image Technologies-- and each unit comes with its own software -- we tested their packages aswell.andP;  To round out the picture, we checked out slide scanners from Howtekand BarneyScan.andM;The results were amazing, especially with a 24-bit video display and softwarethat could take advantage of it.andP;  If you think color on the Mac is justdesktop decoration, take a look at what any of these scanners can do.andP;  You'llbe impressed.andM;But they're also slow, some of them agonizingly so.andP;  They eat memory and diskstorage for breakfast.andP;  You'll want at least 5 megabytes of RAM, preferably8; and the largest hard disk you can find won't be big enough.andP;  One scan cantake up as much as 24 megabytes on disk.andP;  The hardware is all on the cuttingedge, so a lot of it works sometimes rather than always.andP;  And you have towonder what people were thinking about when they designed some of theaccompanying software packages.andP;  Probably IBM PCs.andM;Still, these devices and others soon coming to market promise to have aprofound effect on how color images are handled in the commercial printingworld.andP;  If you're into desktop presentations, you may take exception, but --let's face it -- when it comes to disseminating information, includingimages, we're still in a Gutenberg world.andP;  The final resting place of theoverwhelming majority of the images these scanners are going to scan will bethe printed page.andP;  People will scan colorful things -- I didn't say pictures,because Truvel's flatbed can scan three-dimensional objects as well -- andthen will use computers to correct the colors and generate separations forprinting presses.andM;GOOD THINGS COME IN THREESandM;Sharp JX-450: The Sharp JX-450 flatbed is first in line here because itsscanning engine is at the heart of half of the scanner products we tested.andO;Although Sharp sells the scanner directly, along with a National InstrumentsGPIB NuBus card and an appropriate software driver, it doesn't really claimto provide a ready-to-use scanning package.andP;  Sharp's idea is that vendorswill write JX-450 drivers into their color applications, with all the addedsoftware control that implies.andM;The JX-450 is a 24-bit flatbed capable of scanning images up to 11-x-17inches.andP;  It has variable resolution with a maximum of 300 dots per inch(dpi).andP;  Don't plan on scanning 11-x-17-inch images at 300 dpi, however.andP;  Todo so would require 48 megabytes of memory -- or virtual disk spooling, whichnone of the configurations we tested provided.andP;  Storing such an image on disklikewise requires 48 megabytes (you can get six images onto a 300-megabytedrive).andM;Admittedly this example is extreme, but the 3-x-4-inch image of food thatserved as a test in this article ate up 2.3 megabytes when scanned at 300dpi.andP;  For a not-particularly-large image, that's a lot of disk space.andP;  If youhave to move these images from one location to another, you can forgetfloppies, even the new 1.4-megabyte high-density ones.andP;  You'll have toconsider a cartridge drive.andM;The Sharp scanner works by moving a glass plate across a set of three coloredfluorescent lights, one red, one green, and one blue.andP;  The lights flashalternately in rapid succession as the glass plate moves the image.andP;  Even at300 dpi, the scanning process is pretty quick, well under a minute.andP;  Thevariable-speed motor makes lower-resolution scans finish even faster.andM;The scanner hardware lets the appropriate application control resolution,sharpness, scan speed, image area, and some color correction.andP;  In lieu ofshipping its own application with the JX-450, Sharp ships a programmingmanual, which is about as un-Mac-like as you can get, and a list of othervendors' applications that can drive the scanner (it's an impressive list --see sidebar, &quot;Soft Wares for the Sharp JX-450&quot;).andP;  The extent to which theseapplications take advantage of the scanner's features varies; so does theconvenience of their interfaces.andP;  But all of them provide enough control overthe Sharp to let you capture color pictures.andM;One of the least charming aspects of the JX-450 is its interface to the Mac.andO;It uses GPIB (General Purpose Interface Bus), a standard in wide use byHewlett-Packard and other manufacturers of computer-controlledinstrumentation but physically one of the clunkiest hardware interfacesaround.andP;  Sharp ships the scanner with an NB-GPIB board from NationalInstruments a cable to connect the board to the scanner, and a softwaredriver.andP;  (NB stands for NuBus, which many among you will realize means youmust have a Mac II, IIx, or IIcx to use this scanner.andP;  No word on whetheranyone plans to implement an SE/30 Direct Slot GPIB board that will work forthis purpose.)andM;The GPIB interface does have one redeeming feature: you can easily linkseveral cables by screwing one directly into the other.andP;  But that's the onlynice thing I'm going to say about it.andP;  In the case of the NB-GPIB, theconnector doesn't stick all the way out of the back of the Mac, so you haveto attach an adapter before you can attach the cable.andP;  Getting the NuBus cardand adapter positioned correctly is difficult, but you have to do it onlyonce, and then it gets hidden forever.andM;Then there's configuration.andP;  Fortunately, Sharp preconfigures the GPIB (bysetting device addresses and the like) in the driver it sends with thescanner.andP;  But if you are unlucky enough to have to reconfigure it, you willhave the joy of using such delightful programs as IBIC and IBCONF (thelatter, I presume, stands for &quot;interface bus configuration&quot;; don't ask mewhat the former stands for).andP;  These programs let you check on whether thingssuch as &quot;Assert REN when SC&quot; are set properly.andP;  Since the DIP switches on thescanner I received were set to the wrong GPIB bus address, and since thesoftware package I was using to scan didn't know how to talk to scanners witha nondefault address, I became very familiar with these two hackers'utilities.andP;  I can think of better ways to spend my time.andP;  If you're lucky,you won't have to go near them.andM;Documentation for the Sharp is likewise lacking, most of it being forsoftware developers rather than users.andP;  It does, however, get you up andrunning with your scanner, and Sharp candidly admits that what it is sellingis a back end (the scanner), not an elegantly designed Mac front end(software).andM;All these problems aside, the performance of the scanner is quite good.andP;  Itdoes consistently well across all the applications with which we tested it.andO;The colors appear a little dark, but detail is maintained well (see thesamples).andP;  The scanner, NuBus card, and software driver come to $7,545, but,depending on what you plan to use the scanner for, you will probably have tofigure in the cost of additional software (see sidebar, &quot;Soft Wares for theSharp JX-450&quot;).andM;Scanmaster: Howtek also markets Sharp's canner, with its own version of theNational Instruments NB-GPIB board and its own driver, calling it theScanmaster.andP;  The company also provides a full-featured front-end application,MacScan-It.andP;  To use MacScan-It, you must have Howtek's board and driver; theprogram won't work with Sharp's.andP;  And setting up the Scanmaster involvesnavigating a guided tour of IBCONF.andP;  It's well documented, but I fail to seewhy it's necessary.andP;  Fortunately the tour doesn't last long.andP;  When it's over,you get to the fun part: scanning.andM;Howtek is currently shipping version 1.1 of MacScan-It.andP;  Despite thegreater-than-1.0 numbering, a warning appears on the screen when you launchthe program, telling you that you are working with a less-than-finishedproduct and promising you a free upgrade later.andP;  Howtek's price for itspackage is $8,195, which is $630 more than what Sharp charges.andP;  The onlydifference in what you get is MacScan-It.andP;  Is it a $630 application?andM;I'd have to say no.andP;  MacScan-It is one of those applications that does agreat job of going halfway.andP;  Take its Preview function, which performspreview scans at 75 dpi, regardless of the resolution you have selected foryour final scan, making preview scans go much more quickly than theyotherwise would (someone was paying attention to detail here).andP;  But ratherthan letting you click and drag a rectangle over the preview image to selectthe final scan area, MacScan-It gives you a standard Mac window, completewith title bar, which you must position and resize to make your selection.andO;This window is difficult to line up properly.andM;Or look at how MacScan-It handles color correction.andP;  There's more power hereto do simple color correction than is available in most other scanner captureprograms.andP;  But MacScan-It's Color andamp; Contrast menu also contains suchcounterintuitive items as Linear Color Lookup (which means &quot;default&quot;).andO;Furthermore, the menu isn't organized in a way that makes clear whichselections affect the scan itself, which affect merely the screen display,and which affect the image you save to disk.andP;  Why do some developers put somuch energy into adding features to their products and so little effort intomaking it easy for users to use them?andM;My biggest complaint about MacScan-It is about the way it handles resolution.andO;You can independently set input resolution, output resolution, and outputsize.andP;  This flexibility may seem like an advantage, but I found itconsistently irritating that by selecting 300 dpi from the resolution menu, Iwas not guaranteeing that the image I saved to disk would have the sameresolution, because the program defaults to 72-dpi output (the resolution ofmost Macintosh screens).andP;  It might seem like this stuff should be easy tofigure out, but I never quite got the hang of it.andP;  Don't look for much helpfrom the MacScan-It documentation, either.andP;  It has the same shortcomings asthe user interface.andM;MacScanColor: Then there is New Image Technology's MacScanColor (again withthe Sharp scanning engine).andP;  This time, instead of the National InstrumentsGPIB board, you get New Image's own board (with a more convenient connectorand cable).andP;  You don't need a special driver, nor do you need to mess withIBCONF.andP;  You also get MacScan software.andP;  This complete package (scanner, NewImage GPIB card, and MacScan software) costs only $25 more than Sharp'spackage (the scanner plus National Instruments' GPIB card).andP;  The New Imagepackage is also about $600 less than the Howtek package.andP;  Is Howtek'sMacScan-It better than New Image's MacScanColor?andP;  Yes.andP;  But $600 better?andO;Hardly.andM;Even so, the question arises whether the New Image GPIB card is afull-featured implementation of GPIB that will work with other such devices.andO;The early version of the card had some problems that prevented it fromworking with some of the applications (such as ChromaScan) that did work withthe National Instruments card.andP;  Those problems have been fixed, but we can'tsay whether others might be lurking unnoticed in its silicon recesses.andO;Unless you plan to use the card to talk to any GPIB devices other than theJX-450 scanner, it won't make much difference anyway.andM;The MacScan program is not going to win any awards, either.andP;  MacScan wasoriginally written to drive New Image's black-and-white and gray-scalescanners and was merely modified to accommodate the JX-450 color scanner.andO;Although the 24-bit color images it captures are equal in quality to thosecaptured by other software that drives the same device, there is one seriousshortcoming: MacScan doesn't let you select a degree of image sharpness priorto scanning, a feature that most other applications that drive this scannerdo support.andM;Nor does it have a preview function.andP;  It has a Margins window, from which youdrag the sides of a selection rectangle to indicate what area you want toscan.andP;  But the scanned image appears in a separate window, not in the PReviewwindow, making fine-tuning difficult.andP;  If you are short on memroy and tryingto squeeze every last pixel you can out of a scan while maintaining maximumresolution, this system is a major hassle.andP;  By way of compensation, MacScandoes give you a tool that lets you crop an image after it is scanned, a handyfeature that MacScan-It lacks.andM;The residue of MacScan's origins as a program for driving monochrome scannersis not handled elegantly.andP;  MacScan has an extensive, albeit confusing,editing toolbox for editing black-and-white images.andP;  The tools may beconfusing in black and white, but they don't do anything when you use theprogram with the Sharp color scanner -- they're not even grayed out.andP;  You canselect any tool you like, even get its appropriate drawing cursor on thescreen, but it does nothing.andP;  Furthermore, every time you launch MacScan, itclobbers the Mac's color-lookup table.andP;  Everything on the desktop turns blackand white.andM;In conclusion, if I were going to buy an incarnation of the Sharp scanner,I'd probably go with the New Image package, and, if MacScan weren't adequatefor my needs, I'd get ChromaScan, a $199 program from Imagenesis (seesidebar, &quot;Soft Wares for the Sharp JX-450&quot;).andP;  The Sharp scanner withChromaScan is probably the best price/performance combination available forthe JX-450.andM;TRUE STORIESandM;Then there is the Truvel TZ-3BWC, the other flatbed in the bunch we lookedat.andP;  Like the JX-450, Truvel's scanner can capture 24-bit color images insizes up to about 11-x-17 inches (the Truvel can actually do 12-x-17) and canalso capture monochrome images.andP;  But that's about as far as the similaritygoes.andP;  The TZ-3BWC design is completely different from that of the Sharp.andO;With the Sharp scanner, you place your image face down on a glass, and thescanner's lights and lens move underneath it, inside the scanner.andP;  Truvelputs the lights and lens on a moving arm that rides above the scanner bed, onwhich images are placed face up.andM;The latter approach offers significant advantages.andP;  The lens of the Truvellooks just like a zoom lens for a 35mm camera.andP;  By adjusting it, you canachieve scanning resolutions up to 900 dpi, three times that of the Sharpscanner.andP;  The Truvel scanner can also scan three-dimensional objects, whichthe Sharp cannot even dream of doing.andM;I was really looking forward to working with this scanner.andP;  It's neitherinexpensive, nor small, nor quiet, but it has tremendous potential.andP;  But wedid have a reliability problem.andP;  The first unit we received died after a fewweeks of not-very-intensive use.andP;  So Truvel sent another unit, complete witha service technician, to install and set it up.andP;  When he left, everythingscanned with a pink cast.andM;The third unit we received worked much better and came with a slightly newerversion of the TruScan software.andP;  The colors it captured were much moreaccurate than the previous pinks--roughly equivalent to, though differentthan, the colors captured by the Sharp scanner.andP;  You know what they say:third time's a charm.andP;  I hope that this final unit more accurately representsthe units that Truvel is shipping.andP;  If so, the company has an excellenthardware product.andM;Setting up the Truvel is reasonably simple.andP;  All you have to do is installthe lens-moving arm into the base and plug a SCSI cable from the Mac into theinterface box and another cable from the box into the scanner.andM;You must also go through a one-minute calibration procedure each time youturn on the scanner, change the dpi setting on the lens, change focus, orinstall or remove the Picture Pac.andP;  The Picture Pac is a handy optionalcopyholder with a glass lid.andP;  It's great for pictures that like to curl up atthe edges.andM;Once your scanner is calibrated, you'll probably want to prescan your image,which you do from TruScan's Scanner Area window.andP;  This feature could use alittle work.andP;  My main complaint is that the scanner doesn't have avariable-speed motor.andP;  That's not the software's fault, but it means that ittakes as long to prescan an image--even though it's a low-resolution scan--asit does to scan at 900 dpi.andP;  If you have a large image, you can get a cup ofcoffee while you wait for the prescan to complete.andP;  And once it's begun, youcan't stop it (or a regular scan) by pressing Command-period.andP;  You can eitherwait for your scan to finish or reset your Mac.andM;Fortunately, when you do a regular scan, you can save a selected portion todisk.andP;  My recommendation: don't bother with prescans; just do a normal scanon an area that you know is large enough to contain your image and thenselect and save the area of interest.andM;This method works except when you are tight on memory, but Truvel offers asolution to the memory problem.andP;  The TIB Buffer Box combines a built-in SCSIport, an internal hard-disk drive (45-megabyte removable, 80-megabyte fixed,or 120-megabyte fixed), ports for attaching two truvel scanners (for those ofyou with a lot of images to scan or money to burn), and a port for attachingan external hard disk.andP;  Why all the hard disks?andP;  Because the TIB box givesyou the ability to do background scanning to a hard-disk buffer, and the morehard disks you have available, the more you can scan.andM;This option can be a cost-effective alternative for those short on RAM.andP;  Itallows you to run TruScan software with as little as 2 megabytes in your Mac,while permitting you to scan images larger than those you could capture with8 megabytes of RAM and no buffer box.andP;  (Truvel also offers a $995 Zebra Boardoption, which enhances the sharpness of monochrome line-art scans.)andM;TruScan software is another example of Mac software that follows the letterbut not the spirit of the Mac interface.andP;  It has a long way to go to beintuitive.andP;  It's a classic case of engineering types -- or whoever made thedecision -- putting their technoid stamp on a software interface that shouldhave been designed with users in mind.andP;  For example, to get your imageoriented right-side up in the scanned image window, you have to put it upsidedown on the scanner; it appears with the top to the left in the previewwindow.andP;  And once you have your preview set right, you can't just select Scanfrom the Scan menu; you first have to click on the image window to bring itto the front.andP;  Minor details, perhaps, but annoying.andP;  I could list severalmore, but I'll spare you.andP;  You get good scans, but you have to fight thesoftware a little to do it.andM;At $11,090 for the minimum configuration (add $3,400-$4,400 to that if youget the TIB Buffer Box), the Truvel scanner is not for the budget-conscious.andO;But if you're doing intensive flat (or 3-D) color production work and canafford it -- and if Truvel has address the quality-control issue -- you willfind this product a valuable addition to your desktop.andM;FIXED ON THE SLIDING SCALEandM;We also looked at two 35mm slide scanners, the Scanmaster 35-I from Howtekand the BarneyScan.andP;  Unlike flatbeds, which typically have variableresolution, slide scanners are usually fixed-resolution devices.andP;  TheScanmasters 35 scans 2,000-x-2,000 pixels, the BarneyScan 1,024-x-1,520.andM;The Scanmaster 35: The Scanmaster 35 slide scanner (at $8,195 with GPIB NuBuscard and software) bears a striking resemblance to its Scanmaster flatbedcousin, not in appearance, but in setup and use.andP;  It, too, is a GPIB device,and you can run both the Scanmaster and the Scanmaster 35 from a single NuBuscard (GPIB has some advantages).andP;  Furthermore, it uses the same software,MacScan-It.andP;  To choose scanners from within MacScan-It, you select ConfigureGPIB from the File menu and then select the device you want to use.andM;All the aforementioned pros and cons of MacScan-It apply equally to its usewith the Scanmaster 35.andP;  Two features of the program apply to the Scanmaster35 only, however.andP;  The first is actually a requirement: you have to calibratethe Scanmaster 35 each time you turn it on.andP;  This procedure is simple andnearly automatic--all you have to do is put a piece of black cardboard intothe slide holder, click on OK, wait, take it out, click on OK, and waitagain, as the instructions from the calibration dialog box tell you.andP;  Thesound the scanner emits during calibration is like a foghorn at point-blankrange, but it doesn't last long.andM;The other Scanmaster 35-specific feature is that a dozen or so additionalitems become active on the Original Type submenu of the Color andamp; Contrastmenu.andP;  They let you easily select preconfigured parameters for optimalresults with a wide variety of slide-film types.andM;Results from the Scanmaster 35, were, like those of the other scanners,generally too dark.andP;  This could probably be corrected with controls withinMacScan-It or with a color-correction program.andP;  But this factor, combinedwith MacScan-It's ease-of-use problems, makes the Scanmaster 35 a lessattractive package than BarneyScan, despite the latter's higher cost.andM;BarneyScanMac: Although a spate of new slide scanners is about to hit themarket (see sidebar, &quot;Upcoming Products&quot;), the only other one shipping atpress time was BarneyScan Mac from BarneyScan Corp. We found the $9,495BarneyScan, also designed to scan 35mm slides, to be a better choice(although it costs $1,300 more than the Scanmaster 35), both because it doesa better job of capturing an image correctly and because of the power of thesoftware that comes with it.andM;Which is not to say that it has no problems.andP;  We had our share.andP;  TheBarneyScan slide scanner requires a NuBus card, which means you require a MacII of some variety.andP;  It is a proprietary card to which you can attach only aBarneyScan.andP;  Furthermore, when you first set it up, you must go through acomplete calibration procedure, which takes about 20 minutes.andP;  You save theresults of this procedure in a file.andP;  Each time you start the program, thisfile is read into memory, but you must still perform a minicalibration, asemiautomatic procedure that takes about 3 minutes and requires you to put acouple of slides into the scanner when the software prompts you.andM;The calibration procedure involves BarneyScan Mac software, one of the twoprograms that comes with the scanner.andP;  We found this application, intended tobe a basic capture program for scanning as well, to be unreliable.andP;  Onseveral occasions, the scanner simply halted in midscan.andP;  Sometimes we couldexit gracefully; other times we had to reboot the Mac.andP;  Whether because ofsimilar report of such problems or because BarneyScan XP, the second softwarepackage that ships with the scanner, is so powerful, the Barney folks nowrecommend using XP for basic scanning functions.andP;  We had no problem using thelatter program.andM;BarneyScan XP is a powerful color-correction and paint program, similar toImageStudio or Digital Darkroom, but in living color.andP;  XP currently works inan 8-bit mode and will work in 24-bit color when Apple releases 32-bit ColorQuickDraw.andP;  It does not support the RasterOps 24-bit format.andM;If all you want to do is scan, just click on the Scan button.andP;  XP gives you achoice of manual or automatic exposure.andP;  Automatic works most of the time,performing a prescan of the image, on which it bases its exposures.andM;Within XP is a world of power for the adventurous or for demandingprofessionals.andP;  The program offers a full set of image-processing filters andeven allows you to create your own custom filters.andP;  It also features multiple&quot;channels&quot; -- up to 16 -- for doing specialized color-correction work.andP;  Youcan, for example, create a channel that shows all the red in an image, reducethe amount of red wherever it is more than 50 percent saturated, and thenapply your changes back to the original image.andP;  The program also providestools to free-rotate, skew, create &quot;perspective&quot; in, or arbitrarily distort aselected portion of an image.andM;While XP suffers somewhat from technospeak, it is less offensive than youmight expect, considering the power it brings to the desktop.andP;  Its toolpalette, which follows the precedent set by programs such as PixelPaint,ImageStudio, and Digital Darkroom, will be somewhat familiar to users ofthose programs from the beginning.andP;  The manual also does a concise job ofexplaining how to use the various features of the program and how they work.andM;THE LAST WORDandM;In my opinion, it's a little early for color scanning.andP;  The products have yetto mature: calibration standards for desktop color don't yet exist;color-image formats are still in flux; and software developers, for the mostpart, are still too busy with the technical side of development to producedecent Macintosh interfaces for their products.andP;  Just as monochrome andgray-scale scanners took a year or two to catch on but are now becoming amore common part of the desktop, color scanners have yet to settle in.andP;  Inthe next year, Apple's release of 32-bit Color QuickDraw will open new doorsto the wonderful world of color; scanner hardware and software will improve,as will color-output devices; and prices will come down.andM;Still, you may not want to wait.andP;  If you need color now and can afford it,here are our recommendations.andP;  For the cost-conscious, the Sharp scanner inits New Image incarnation, along with Imagenesis' ChromaScan, is probablyyour best buy.andP;  New Image's MacScan software leaves a lot to be desired, butit's worth the $25 extra you pay to buy the scanner from New Image instead ofdirectly from Sharp.andP;  You'll do all right either way.andM;The Truvel scanner offers the best solution for those with more demandingrequirements and the money to meet them.andP;  Its quality is somewhat better thanSharp's, and it has the advantage of being able to scan at resolutions up to900 dpi and handle 3-D objects.andP;  If you plan to use a Truvel scanner in aproduction environment, the TIB Buffer Box is worth serious consideration.andM;For those in the market for a slide scanner, we recommend BarneyScan Mac overHowtek's Scanmaster 35 despite its higher cost.andP;  The Scanmaster has aslightly higher resolution, but its image quality is inferior.andP;  AndBarneyScan XP software runs circles around MacScan-It.andM;The list of color scanners in the pipeline is longer than the list ofscanners we tested for this article.andP;  One of these newcomers could be awinner.andP;  We'll just have to wait and see.andP;  Keep a particularly sharp eye outfor Microtek's $4,000 flatbed scanner, due out in early summer.andP;  If it works,it could blow the bottom out of the color-flatbed market.andM;Soft Wares for the Sharp JX-450andM;Sharp has chosen to market its scanner, the JX-450, without the customscanning application that typically accompanies such hardware.andP;  Instead, thecompany encourages vendors of color software to incorporate drivers for theJX-450 into their applications.andP;  The features provided by these variousapplications vary.andP;  Here's rundown:andM;ChromaScan (Imagenesis, 901 N.E.andP;

 It allows you to capture images as black and white,gray-scale, 8-bit color with several dither options, or 24-bit color(RasterOps format).andP;  Its basic color controls are easier to use than similarcontrols in many other programs.andP;  All in all, it's a good value, which is whywe chose it to produce the test images for the Sharp scanner that appear inthis article.andP;  One major criticism: it saves files in PICT2 format only.andO;We'd prefer to see TIFF added.andM;LaserPaint Color II (LaserWare, P.O. box 668, San Rafael, CA 94915;

is becoming one of the buzzwords of the year and willbuzz even louder when Apple releases its new 32-bit Color QuickDraw laterthis year.andM;So what does all this mean to mortals?andM;Let's start with black and white.andP;  As you probably know by now, a monochromeimage, such as the kind you see on a Mac Plus or SE, has pixels that can beonly black or white.andP;  To simulate shades of gray, the display sets certaindots as balck or white in a specific pattern by a process called dithering.andO;You can see this pattern clearly if you go into the zoom mode in anyblack-and-white paint program.andM;With the appearance of the Mac II, both gray scale and color becameavailable.andP;  Instead of having only 1 bit of information for each pixel on thescreen, now the Mac had 8 bits.andP;  An 8-bit, gray-scale monitor uses these 8bits of information per pixel to display 256 shades of gray.andM;An 8-bit color monitor uses the same 8 bits to display 256 colors.andP;  Colormonitors have three electron &quot;guns,&quot; all firing at the screen at the sametime: one red, one green, one blue.andP;  All the colors you see are created bycombinations of these three primary colors.andP;  (When you're dealing withmonitors, red, green, and blue are the primary colors -- not red, blue andyellow).andM;But 256 is not a lot of colors.andP;  Just as monochrome monitors must usedithering to create an illusion of gray, so 8-bit color monitors usedithering to simulate more than the 256 colors they can actually display.andM;Fortunately, the Macintosh can display more than 256 colors.andP;  In fact, it candisplay more than 16.7 million colors -- if you have a 24-bit video card.andO;With 24 bits of color information per pixel, you can have 8 bits each forred, blue, and green.andP;  The difference is dramatic.andM;Why spend all this time talking about displays in an article about scanners?andO;Because what a scanner does is just the opposite of what the display does.andM;When you scan with any of the devices we tested, you can save a 24-bit colorimage, 8 bits each for red, bue, and green (RGB).andP;  The scanners use variousmeans to capture the RGB information.andP;  The Sharp, for example, has lights ofthree colors and makes a single pass over the image, flashing the lightsalternately.andP;  The Truvel has a single light and a rapidly rotating filterwheel with red, blue, and green filters.andP;  It also captures the image in asingle pass.andP;  the two slide scanners make three separate passes over theimage, once each for red, blue, and green information.andP;  The three 8-bitpieces of color information for each pixel are then combined into a single24-bit value that can be displayed and stored on disk.andM;When you display your scanned image, if you have an 8-bit monitor, your Macdithers the image to create an approximation of the 24-bit values that arereally there.andP;  How it dithers depends on the particular application you'reusing.andP;  If you have 24-bit video, however, you can see the &quot;true&quot; color ofeach pixel.andM;For the most part, we used an 8-bit display to work with the images wecaptured with the scanners tested.andP;  Our experience led us to the conclusionthat, if you are serious about working with clor scans, particularly if youare going to try to do any color correction on your Mac, a 24-bit video cardshould be high on your list of items to buy.andP;  with 8 bits, you simply won'tbe able to see colors well enough to do critical color work, no matter howgood a job of dithering your software does.andM;Although RasterOps is currently the only 24-bit color game in town, theformat it uses for internally storing 24-bit information is different fromthe format Apple has said it plans to use in its new Color Quick draw.andP;  Bythe time you read this, Apple will hopefully have firmed up its plans forreleasing this new system-software addition.andM;Several vendors -- including RasterOps -- are already developing 24-bitboards to support this new Apple standard.andP;  These boards will be released assoon as Apple releases its code.andP;  And you can bet that 24-bit versions ofpractically any color software package you can name will be available shortlythereafter.andP;  If you're going to buy into 24-bit color, go with the Applestandard.andP;  If you can't wait and want to buy the current RasterOps product,get a clear commitment on the upgrade policy; make sure you won't get leftbehind when Apple's new software comes out.andM;Getting What You SeeandM;In a black-and-white or gray-scale graphic environment, the tones you seeon-screen are close enough to what you'll see on paper.andP;  The only significantdifference between screen and print may be the overall contrast.andP;  But life isnot that simple in the color-graphics world.andP;  An image that appears on acolor monitor seldom matches the printed version.andP;  If you compose and displayall your work only on-screen, you needn't concern yourself with suchdiscrepancies, but if your work sees print, you can take steps to ensure thecolor fidelity of the final output.andM;Color monitors add their own base color to an image -- typically extra blue,but sometimes green or red prevail.andP;  You can tell your monitor's color biasby seeing how it renders whites.andP;  Typically, a monitor's white is cool, butwe're so accustomed to that version of &quot;white&quot; that we ignore its high bluecontent.andP;  Variations exist among monitors from different manufacturers,different models from the same manufacturer, and even identical models.andM;Some color-graphic applications offer the option of specifying colors bytheir Pantone numbers or by percentage of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black.andO;With those options, you can compose your work on a black-and-white screen,knowing that what you see on-screen is not what will print.andP;  With graphicprograms in which you select colors based totally on their screen appearance,you're at the mercy of your monitor.andP;  You have several options for betterscreen/print fidelity.andM;ADJUST THE HARDWAREandM;If your monitor's whites are noticeably skewed toward some color, you canelectronically adjust the monitor to display whiter whites.andP;  This proceduremay be as simple as tweaking externally mounted controls for red, green, andblue intensity.andP;  If you monitor lacks external controls, and most do, you canhave it adjusted by a dealer, who will do an inside tweak with the power on-- not generally a safe procedure for untrained mortals.andP;  If you can arrangeit, try to be present during the adjustment so you can have your say.andM;USE YOUR SOFTWARE'S TALENTSandM;FreeHand's approach to color-display correction uses a preprinted color cardand a special Clor dialog.andP;  You select an on-screen color and use the Mac'scolor wheel to adjust that color to match its printed equivalent moreclosely.andP;  This form of correction affects only the on-screen appearance ofonly process and Pantone colors, not spot colors.andP;  The adjustment does notaffect the CMYK percentages specified in the printed image.andP;  Unfortunatelyfor less endowed applications, the corrective display effect is availableonly while FreeHand is  active.andM;USE YOUR WITSandM;* Use your production software to make a color-calibration card with swatchesof 100 percent cyan, magenta, yellow, and black; 50 percent cyan, magenta,yellow, and black; plus 100 percent/100 percent and 50 percent/50 percentmixes of these colors with each other, giving you red, green, blue, and lightred, green, blue, and gray.andP;  Have the card printed, using your routineprocess.andP;  You'll then have a color-calibration, file and a printed versionfor comparison.andM;* Set your ambient lighting to that of some typical environment -- the whiterthe light, the better.andP;  Put your software into a mode in which you can chooseand edit colors, and hold the printed card up to your monitor.andM;* Use the CMYK mode of your program to match on-screen colors to the colorcard.andP;  If your software doesn't have CYMK settings, use the RGB color model.andO;Note the percentage tweaks you have to make to get a screen color to matchthe corresponding color on the card.andP;  Hopefully, the tweaking percentageswill be small.andM;* Use the resulting numbers as an adjustment factor for any color you chooseby sight alone.andP;  For example, let's say that to match your screen color withits printed counterpart you must increase the on-screen yellow by 5 percentand on-screen magenta by 3 percent.andP;  These numbers indicate that you've beenlooking at an overly blue screen image.andP;  One day you develop a color thatlooks great on-screen, but you must presume that the color will printincorrectly if you leave it as is.andP;  To correct it for printing, you mustreduce its yellow component by 5 percent and its magenta component by 3percent and use the &quot;corrupted&quot; version, knowing that it will print closer towhat you originally saw on-screen.andM;With any adjustment method you use, do a mandatory set of test prints to seeif your adjustment strategy worked and to help you home in on a progressivelybetter match between screen and print.andM;Still Life with Six ScansandM;The Macbeth ColorChecker is widely used as a standard for color correctionand comparison.andP;  The &quot;Food&quot; is a custom still life that a commercial photostudio shot for us to challenge scanners with a wide range of colors and bothshadow detail and highlight detail.andP;  All scans were done with defaultsettings (no color correction was applied), separated with PhotoMac, andoutput on a Linotronic 300.andM;Figure 1: We produced these images using traditional photomechanicalcolor-separation techniques.andP;  Figure 2: We used a beta version of ChromaScan(1.1b4) to produce 24-bit images that PhotoMac could separate correctly.andP;  Noother software would do the trick.andP;  Although the results are dark, thecontrast is reasonably good and detail is held in all but the darkest shadowareas.andP;  The deficiencies in these images could probably be corrected withcolor-correction software.andP;  Figure 3: Although the software for theScanmaster and the Sharp JX-450 is different, the scanners are identical;their scans are virtually indistinguishable.andP;  Figure 4: These look almostexactly like the previous two.andP;  Close examination of the cromalins (prepresscolor proffs) shows them to be a little less dark, but this may not havecarried over into the printed version you see here.andP;  Figure 5: While theColorChecker appears closer to the original colors than in the scans producedby the Sharp scanner, Food appears to be enveloped in a thin veil of greensmog.andP;  However, all of the original image detail is retained and, as with theSharp scanner-generated images, the Truvel scans could probably be easilycorrected.andP;  Figure 6: As you can see, hardware controls the basic quality ofthe images more than software.andP;  the colors in ColorChecker are quite dark,and those in Food have a gray-green cast.andP;  Detail, however, is excellent.andO;Figure 7: BarneyScan held the ColorChecker colors better than any otherscanner.andP;  The Food colors are very saturated but are also darker than thoseof the other scanners.andP;  Setting the scan exposure manually (we used theautomatic exposure setting) or using postcapture correction could lighten thecolors.andP;  Like the other scans, this one retains the detail.andM;Upcoming ProductsandM;As the sands ran out at MacUser Labs, we received word on four new scannersthat will be on the market by the time you read this: the Microtek MSF-300Zflatbed and three slide scanners -- the Nikon LS-3500, the Eiconix (Kodak)1435 Slide Scanner, and Array Technologies' Slide Scanner.andP;  The latter threemodels are vying for the top end of the desktop-professional scanner  market.andM;The MSF-300Z, previewed at the March Seybold show in San Francisco, is alow-cost flatbed scanner that contains many of the features of its morecostly Microtek siblings.andP;  The scanner can scan at up to 300-dpi resolution,in 24-bit color, and promises to scan faster, last longer, and produce a moreaccurate scan than the competition in its class, according to the company.andO;The scanning software will incorporate &quot;virual scanning&quot; to enable scanningof images larger than RAM size.andP;  It's scheduled to ship in early summer witha package price of $3,995.andM;The Nikon LS-3500, the first here in our lineup of three new slide scanners,was set to debut at April's National Computer Graphics Association show inPhiladelphia and will no doubt provide us with the incentive to buy anerasable optical drive: the files from this scanner can be 97 megabytes!andO;This incredible size results from a high resolution of 4,096-x-6,144 lines.andO;The software included has prescan capabilities; performs separations onimages; and can export in TIFF, TARGA, PICT, and raw RGB formats.andP;  Itrequires a GPIB board (which comes in the $495 driver/software kit).andP;  Thecurrent price projection is $9,995 for the scanner alone.andM;Directly competing with the Nikon product is the Eiconix 1435 Slide Scanner,priced similarly at $10,000.andP;  You also need a GPIB board ($595 from NationalInstruments) and software ($495 for the user variety, $1,495 for thedeveloper variety).andP;  Eiconix's scanner boasts these features: 2,800-dpiimages; export in TIFF, TARGA, and PICT formats; auto-calibration and colorbalance; 36-bit color information (reduced to 24-bit for Mac importing); anda signal-to-noise ratio of at least 1,000:1.andP;  The Eiconix scanner, after manydelays, was set to ship in april.andM;On the extreme top end of the desktop market will be the Array TechnologiesSlide Scanner.andP;  This scanner isn't in the high-end realm just because of itsprice ($20,000); it also boasts a wealth of features.andP;  Array Technologiesclaims that by moving a standard Hitachi color-TV-camera array sensor(256-x-256 lines) in subpixel increments and then subtracting neighborsamples, using its DSP-driven postprocessor, the scanner can produce imagescomparable to those of a professional-quality drum scanner.andP;  As with theEiconix scanner, the Array Technologies scanner stores and manipulates itsdata in 36 bits but reduces the data set to 24 bits for Macintoshcompatibility.andP;  Besides the potentially superior image quality, the ArrayTechnologies Slide Scanner software touts numerous image-postprocessingcapabilities, including an adjustabel saturation index that makes it possibleto saturate most colors in the scanned image while leaving selected areasuntouched.andP;  The Array Technologies scanner will also be available in April.andM;If you are in the market for a color slide-scanning system, one of thesethree newcomers may be perfect for you, or if you have always wanted to put aRenoir on your desktop but don't have $9,000 to spend, the Microtek may fitperfectly.andP;  Their manufacturer specifications look impressive, and eachscanner is well worth an inquisitive gander.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
