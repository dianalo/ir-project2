The European Community is in the center of all thesenegotiations.</LP><TEXT>   U.S. and EC officials say they are making progress innegotiations on scaling down the billions of dollars insubsidies that West Germany, France, Britain and Spain haveprovided to Airbus Industrie, the Western European civilaircraft manufacturing consortium that competes with U.S.companies in the world market for jet airliners.   But U.S. trade-policy officials say they haven't ruled outthe idea of asking for the appointment of a specialinternational panel, under the rules of the General Agreementon Tariffs and Trade, to investigate the Airbus Industriesubsidies, if it appears the EC and the U.S. can't resolvethis trade dispute through bilateral negotiations by latenext month.   Some headway also is being made in other negotiations,under way for more than a year within the Paris-basedOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development, on aproposed agreement to reduce government subsidies tocommercial shipbuilders in Western Europe and Japan.   The U.S. has been pressing for such an agreement, inresponse to complaints from members of Congress and U.S.shipyards that domestic shipbuilders can't compete for ordersagainst heavily subsidized shipyards in Western Europe, Japanand South Korea.   An international agreement to limit such subsidies may bereached by late this year, U.S. officials say.   The problems relating to trade in passenger autos,particularly Japan's future exports of cars to WesternEuropean countries, are less immediate.   However, talks already are under way between the EC andJapan about so-called &quot;voluntary&quot; restrictions on shipmentsof cars made by Japanese companies to the Common Market forfive years, starting in early 1993, according to EC officialsin Washington.   Such quota arrangements will be needed, they say, if theEC is to persuade France, Italy and other EC countries thatthey should abandon by late 1992 their own &quot;national&quot; quotason imports of Japanese cars that have been in effect for along while.   Currently, the U.S. is a only an &quot;interested bystander&quot; tothe exploratory talks between the EC and Japan about autotrade restrictions. This situation could change if ECCommissioner Frans Andriessen and other Common Marketofficials conclude that the EC-Japanese trade accord shouldalso cover cars exported by Japanese auto makers from theirU.S. assembly plants. This now seems likely.   U.S. Trade Representive Carla Hills says any suchrestriction on U.S. car exports would be unacceptable.</TEXT></DOC>
