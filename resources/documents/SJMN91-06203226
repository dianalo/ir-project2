We have threeaverage children, 15, 12 and 10 years of age. We live in an average city, NewHaven, Conn. Like other average families, we have a hard time putting away afew dollars every month for our children's college education.;    As tight asthings are, next week I am going to New York to spend $825 on jackets for ourthree sons. These are not ordinary jackets. They are bulletproof. We heardabout them from my husband's brother, who bought some for his children. Theywere purchased from a former New York City police officer whose security firmis marketing them.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  BULLETPROOFING THE KIDS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     The brochure says the synthetic material that goes into these jackets will&quot;stop slugs and save lives.&quot; It says, &quot;You may get some bad bruises from theimpact of the bullets and maybe some broken ribs, but the bullets will notpierce the body.&quot;;    The synthetic material is five times stronger than steeland relatively lightweight. Nobody will know it is bulletproof except theperson wearing it.;    Since you deal with all sorts of contemporary issues, Ithought you might like to hear about the latest.;    -- Deeply Concerned; inConnecticut;    DEAR CONCERNED -- If bulletproof jackets give you and yourhusband peace of mind, fine, but it might be more important to instruct yourchildren to steer clear of places where bullets may be flying.;    The realsolution is to get rid of the guns now in circulation and make it a lot harderto get new ones. Last year in Chicago, 324 people under age 21 were chargedwith gun-related murder, more than triple the number in 1985. Eighty-three ofthe murderers were no more than 16 years old. In Los Angeles, a seriouscrackdown on teen-age gangs has started in earnest. Let's hope it sweeps thecountry.; DEAR ANN -- I'm a nobody in a small town in Texas. I can't getanyone's attention, but maybe you can. I'm certainly not the only person whois upset by the packaging of breakfast cereals.;    First, the box is so bigit will not fit on the average shelf. You try to stand it up but you can't, soyou lay it down and the cereal falls out. You finally put it in the laundryroom, next to the detergent. When you open the box you can't find the cereal.Half the box is empty. Does cereal need 5 inches of air?;    The instructionsfor opening the box tell you to push the tab in and pull back, but it isreinforced with three layers of cardboard and nobody can get to it without aknife. So, after the knife slips and you have to go to the emergency room toget 12 stitches in your hand, you come home and look for a meat cleaver, chopthe box open and put the cereal in a jar, which you should have done in thefirst place.;    Ann, you will be performing a valuable service if you printthis letter. Maybe the manufacturers (who pay packaging experts millions toscrew up) will listen to you.;    -- Floyd A. Butcher,; Kempner, Texas;   DEAR FLOYD -- Here's your letter. If I hear anything from the cerealcompanies, I'll let you know. Thanks for writing.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Ann Landers column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910721  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2L  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  555  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday July 21, 199100203226,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
