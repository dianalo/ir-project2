(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Members of the U.S. Lutheran-RomanCatholic dialogue team say they expect to complete work on the topicof ``One Mediator, the Saints and Mary'' by September, but it'sgoing to be difficult.   Many Catholics invoke Mary and the saints to intercede with Godwhile Lutherans generally regard that practice as contrary to theview of Christ as the only intercessor.   The Lutheran co-chair, the Rev. H. George Anderson, president ofLuther College in Decorah, Iowa, says that ``as we have to decidewhat points of view will get into the final document, the tensiongets higher.''   The Catholic co-chair, Archbishop Francis Stafford of Denver,says that ``Lutherans must realize that our theology and practice ofinvocation of the saints does not, in our mind and tradition,compromise the unique mediation of Jesus but rather enhances it.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Fri PMs March 24.</NOTE></DOC>
