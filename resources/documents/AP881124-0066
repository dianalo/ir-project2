The company operates the plant for the U.S.Department of Energy.   The amount of uranium processed at the plant dropped from 8,250tons last year to about 1,110 tons this year, he said. Productionshould continue at the decreased level for at least several years,Boswell said.   The exact number of layoffs has not been determined, but a figureof 300 ``is not unreasonable,'' he said.   The layoffs could affect some of the 625 workers represented bythe Atomic Trades Labor Council who went on strike Oct. 7. Non-unionemployees also would be affected, plant officials said.   The plant 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati is officially known asthe Feed Materials Production Center and employs about 1,500 people.It processes uranium, some of which is molded into ingots and barsthat are used to fuel Energy Department reactors in other states.The plant also produces uranium for nuclear weapons.   Layoffs began with 50 workers last March after the departmentclosed the plant's chief customer, the Hanford nuclear reactor inWashington state.   The plant has been shifting from production to cleanup. Boswellsaid environmental repairs will continue at the plant even if itnever processes uranium again.   The plant has been criticized in recent years for having emittedthousands of pounds of radioactive dust into the air, the ground,and underground water. The state of Ohio and the plant's neighborshave separate U.S. District Court lawsuits pending which allege thatthe plant has contaminated its environment and endangered residents'health.</TEXT></DOC>
