Yet the tube keeps on trying, as evidenced by two programs this month, one from public TV and one from Turner Broadcasting. Both claim to have been made without interference from the Soviet authorities, and both show aspects of Soviet life seldom glimpsed by Americans. But they couldn't be more different in terms of cost, scale, ambition -- and degree of understanding.    The first is small potatoes. Next Tuesday, March 29 (9-10 p.m. EST), PBS's &quot;Frontline&quot; series presents &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.,&quot; a documentary about an American family returning to Moscow after a 20-year absence. When Jerrold Schecter was Moscow correspondent for Time magazine in the late 1960s, he and his wife chose to live away from the American enclave, and to enroll their five children in Soviet schools. Having written a book about their experiences, the Schecters decided last year to go back and see for themselves what all the fuss was about.    The result is a low-budget film of the Schecters chatting with Russian friends and acquaintances about the changes that have occurred under Mikhail Gorbachev. But if that sounds boring, it isn't. Unlike most Americans who take part in such dialogues, the Schecters seem to know whom they are talking to, and what they are talking about. Suddenly we realize that these conversations are real, not staged, and that something called &quot;glasnost&quot; really exists. Even the Russians openly disagree about such subjects as political apathy among privileged youth, the trade-off between economic freedom and security, the status of refuseniks, and the indoctrinational aspects of Soviet education.    Much bigger potatoes is &quot;Portrait of the Soviet Union,&quot; a glossy, seven-hour series produced for TBS by Britain's Antelope Films Ltd. (It began airing on SuperStation TBS last night and continues tonight, 8-11 p.m. EST, and Tuesday, 8-10 p.m. EST; then it repeats on March 29-31, and on April 10, 17 and 24.) In contrast with the Schecters' modest aims, Ted Turner has declared that he &quot;originated&quot; this project because the American media have failed to convey an adequate picture of the Soviet people. &quot;Mostly, we see their government officials in Moscow. As a result, our images of Soviet life are limited to what we've seen of their capital city. . . . We're hoping to broaden the viewers' experience of this great country.&quot;    To be fair, there are some good moments in &quot;Portrait of the Soviet Union.&quot; The poet Yvgeny Yevtushenko eloquently expresses the hopes of many Soviets that glasnost is not just a temporary thaw. And reminiscent of the Schecters' film, there is some candid dialogue between a skeptical American and a not-so-skeptical Briton living and working in a Siberian mining town. But this dialogue provides the only note of honest disagreement in the entire, insufferably harmonious seven hours.    The series does not lack for images. We meet host Roy Scheider in the familiar environs of Red Square, but immediately we are carried away between the wintry banks of the Volga, over the crystalline waters of Lake Baikal, through the sunlit markets of Iblisi, above the misty peaks of the Caucasus, and across the golden grasslands of the Ukraine. If our mental picture of the U.S.S.R. previously has consisted of gray, grim folk waiting in line to buy a few shriveled vegetables, we'll be surprised by the stunning cinematography of Michael Reagan. It's hard to say which is more breathtaking, the vast sweep of the land or the rainbow of the people.    But why must everything be breathtaking? Back in 1985, when Mr. Turner was negotiating with the Soviets about the Goodwill Games (his ill-starred alternative to the Olympics that won few viewers and lost $25 million), part of the deal was that TBS would produce a few hours of travelogue-style material on the U.S.S.R., to be broadcast along with 129 hours of athletic competition. Ira Miskin, the executive producer of the current series, says that &quot;Portrait&quot; did not grow out of that earlier travelogue material.    But what is a travelogue, if not an effort to display only that which is attractive? &quot;Portrait&quot; shows one line of consumers, but quickly identifies them as New Year's celebrants in a &quot;shopping frenzy&quot; of gift-buying, because, as Mr. Scheider intones, &quot;the Russians love their children.&quot; The narration includes references to shortages, but the only hardship actually shown is newsreel footage of the siege of Leningrad. Likewise, there are some shots of Chernobyl, but the narration emphasizes that two other reactors are working splendidly -- proof that &quot;the lessons of the past have been learned.&quot; Not only that, &quot;morale among Ukrainians is high&quot; because &quot;they've learned to face the threat united.&quot;    If this narration seems a trifle upbeat, wait till you hear the rest. For disturbingly long stretches, this handsome travelogue is accompanied by what can only be considered a clear stream of Soviet propaganda unpolluted by doubts, questions or negative memories. During the first hour, while being shown a famous writers' enclave outside Moscow, we are informed that &quot;Pasternak lived here and started it all, and now the princes of literature have their homes in this Russian Beverly Hills.&quot; Only at the end of the hour is there a brief reference to the Pasternaks' sufferings at the hands of the Soviet state.    While admiring restored churches, we're told that the Russian church, &quot;so long a misfit,&quot; is &quot;still alive after 1,000 turbulent years.&quot; The only Jews mentioned are those in Tbilisi who have a &quot;thriving community&quot; where &quot;everyone worships.&quot; The Armenians &quot;have at last found stability under the Soviets wing, after generations of persecution and genocide.&quot; The Baltic states &quot;may not be independent nations now, but as independent peoples, they are as strong as ever.&quot;    Then there's Stalin, currently taking the official rap for all the evils of Soviet history. In the final hour, Mr. Scheider dutifully recites the party line: &quot;Reasoned reexamination of Lenin's writings suggest that his successor Stalin took the country down a path that was not at all what the founding father intended.&quot; And if the name Stalin makes you think of Siberia, relax. According to the narration, Siberia was settled more by brave pioneers than by forced exiles. Today it boasts several &quot;clean, bright, fresh&quot; communities that were &quot;conceived, planned and thoughtfully blended into the landscape&quot; while also being &quot;connected to the outside world by roads, airports and thoughts of peace displayed in signs everywhere.&quot; As Mr. Scheider says this, the camera lingers lovingly on a huge propaganda mural.    And we thought Ted Turner had gotten out of the billboard business. </TEXT></DOC>
