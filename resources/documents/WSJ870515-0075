The division, formerly called United Fruit, will move its East Coast operations, including about 440 employees in New York, Boston and Montvale, N.J., to the Cincinnati area, United Brands confirmed.    United Brands and American Financial Corp., which owns about 90% of the company, both have headquarters in Cincinnati. American Financial is controlled by Cincinnati investor Carl H. Lindner, who is also chairman and chief executive officer of United Brands.    Recently, J.C. Penney Co. and Mobil Corp. announced plans to move out of New York.    The Chiquita Brands move is intended to achieve financial and operating efficiencies and allow easier communication with the parent companies, United Brands said.    United Brands hopes to complete the move by the end of the second quarter of 1988. A company vice president said details of the move, including how many of the employees would be relocated, aren't yet settled. He couldn't say what the move's impact on earnings will be.    Chiquita Brands sells fresh fruit and packaged goods, such as juice and desserts. United Brands also has a meat division. </TEXT></DOC>
