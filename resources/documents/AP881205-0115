The strike closed schools in the absence of city-employedjanitors, affected traffic control, and halted the issuing of birthcertificates. Newborn babies were left stranded in hospitals becauseunder Italian law they cannot be released without the certificates.   The strike ended after unions urged workers to return to theirjobs pending a Dec. 14 decision on their demands by a provincialcommission.   The strike began 13 days ago because of a dispute over theschedule of retroactive pay to city employees. A court ruled thepayments should be made in installments over a 24-month period, butemployees demanded they be paid over a 12-month period.</TEXT></DOC>
