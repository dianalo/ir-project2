Gorbachev.   Two senior U.S. officials said a prospective``confidence-building'' measure due to be approved in Moscow nextweek had fallen through.   They also told reporters that two other arms control measuresmay not be completed during Reagan's talks with Gorbachev.   Assistant Secretary of State Rozanne L. Ridgway said the Sovietshad turned down a U.S. proposal for pre-notification of missiletest launches.   And Lt. Gen. Colin Powell, the president's national securityadviser, said two agreements on monitoring underground nuclear testexplosions were not likely to be ready for Reagan and Gorbachev toapprove.   The first deals with trying out U.S. and Soviet measuringdevices at test explosions in July and August.The joint experimentsin Nevada and at Semipalatinsk apparently will proceed in July andAugust.   But Powell said that ``a few technical issues have to beresolved.'' The second protocol deals with so-called peaceful testexplosions. Powell said negotiators were having difficultyreconciling the Russian and English versions.   The explosions were limited to 150 kilotons in 1974 and 1976treaties. Reagan has said he would submit them to the Senate forratification if verification measures were improved. It was notclear if the setback in summit plans would affect his plan.   Mrs. Ridgway, meanwhile, did not explain why the tentativeagreement to notify each other before missiles test launchings hadfallen through.   She indicated the Soviets wanted a more sweeping``confidence-building'' measure that was unacceptable to the UnitedStates.   Reagan spent more than two hours today in separate meetings withPowell and Secretary of State George P. Shultz as he prepared forSunday's opening of the summit, and said of Reagan: ``He's upbeat.''   Reagan, in a pre-recorded radio speech, hailed improvements inhuman rights in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.   But, he said, ``the basic structure of the system has notchanged,'' And, he said, ``there remain significant violations ofhuman rights and freedoms.''   The speech was Reagan's weekly Saturday radio broadcast.   In a telecast to the Soviet Union, he appealed for more opennessand religious freedom, while praising Gorbachev as a break with thepast.   ``I have to say I think there is a difference between thisgeneral secretary and other of your leaders that I had met with inthe past,'' Reagan said.   The interview was recorded before Reagan left Washington. Hewill open talks in Moscow with Gorbachev on Sunday.   Stressing the human rights issue, Reagan noted that Gorbachevhad lessened some of the restrictions on the Russian Orthodoxchurch.   ``I`ve just wondered if there isn't a field there in your owncountry for more openness and the allowing of people to practicereligion in the ways they choose,'' Reagan said.   An ardent anti-communist throughout his political career, Reagansaid none of Gorbachev's predecessors had an dreams ofrestructuring the economy _ the program known as ``perestroika.''   ``I felt that we had to exist in the world together,'' he said.``Our systems are different. We're going to be competitive in anumber of ways, and that will continue. But we can be competitivewithout being hostile to the point of conflict with each other.''   Reagan on Friday invited jubilant Senate leaders to join him andGorbachev at the Moscow summit to celebrate final ratification of atreaty banishing medium-range nuclear missiles from European soil.   The treaty, approved 93-5 by the Senate on Friday after weeks ofheated debate, represents the only brake on the arms race thatReagan has been able to achieve during his two-term presidency, andhe seemed eager to make the most of it.   In Moscow, the collective Soviet presidency today unanimouslyratified the treaty.   A session of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, a 36-memberbody headed by President Andrei A. Gromyko, met in special sessionand cast a traditional unanimous vote in favor of the pact.   Reagan said he was ``very pleased'' by the overwhelming Senatevote, which enables him to enter next week's summit talks carryingclear evidence of broad bipartisan support back home for his armscontrol policies.   White House chief of staff Howard Baker, who stayed behind toawait the Senate vote, was flying to Helsinki late today to placethe treaty documents in Reagan's hands before he leaves for Moscowon Sunday.   At the president's request, Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd,D-W.Va., and Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., are to fly to theSoviet capital on Tuesday to witness Reagan's exchange ofratification documents with Gorbachev the following day.   ``We're just delighted that we're going to send you a treaty andit was almost a unanimous vote,'' Byrd told Reagan by telephonemoments after the Senate vote.   ``We are very pleased to be able to give you this in advance ofyour stepping on Soviet territory in Moscow,'' Dole said.   The treaty, which Reagan and Gorbachev signed at theirWashington summit last December, required some last-minutenegotiations with the Soviets to tighten compliance procedures. Italso survived determined opposition from a small band ofconservative Republicans led by Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina.   In the meantime, the president retreated into seclusion again.The only major interruption in his pre-summit rest stop since hisarrival early Thursday morning was a major foreign policy speech toa Finnish audience on Friday.   White House aides kept reporters, photographers and thetelevision cameras away from the president otherwise. MarlinFitzwater, the presidential spokesman, denied a report that Reaganseemed to be limping slightly when he stepped from a limousine tocall on Finnish President Mauno Koivisto.   In the speech, delivered in the same hall where the 1975Helsinki agreement on human rights was signed, Reagan urged theSoviets to accelerate the pace of reform.   Some of the measures taken by Gorbachev in his three years atthe Kremlin helm are ``new and good,'' Reagan said, but the Sovietsstill fall short of meeting international standards on human rightsand freedom.   Ironically, Reagan called Moscow to task over a pact which hehad opposed in 1975.   Political conservatives like Reagan saw the 35-nation agreementas accepting the post-World War II borders of Eastern Europe andthereby approving Soviet hegemony in the region.   However, the pact sought to ease East-West tensions by promotinga freer exchange of people and ideas. It has since served as ahandy weapon for critics of Moscow.   ``Soviet practice does not _ or does not yet _ measure up toSoviet commitment,'' Reagan said.</TEXT></DOC>
