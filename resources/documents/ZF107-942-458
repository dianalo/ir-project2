The nuPrometheus League has no ambition beyondseeing the genius of a few Apple employees benefit the entire world.&quot;andM;The group has been silent since its initial contacts despite its promise offuture mailings containing source code to other parts of the Mac system.andM;When contacted last week, Ward, who said he was employed at Apple as asystems programmer working mainly on networking issues involving the AppleII, declined to comment on the contents of the CompuServe document on theadvice of his attorney.andM;However, Ward did say he has cooperated with the subpoena that called for himto be fingerprinted Nov. 21 as part of a grand-jury investigation by the U.S.andO;Attorney's office.andM;According to the CompuServe document, Ward was told he fit the FBI's profileof the culprit or culprits behind the nuPrometheus League because he is aprogrammer and had attended a liberal college.andP;  Ward also said the agent toldhim he is a suspect because he helped form a group for gifted people calledthe Cincinnatus Society that, like the nuPrometheus League, draws its namefrom Greek mythology.andP;  In his electronic report, Ward wrote that the agentwas wrong because Cincinnatus was a figure in ancient Roman history.andM;Apple and FBI officials declined to comment on the investigation.andP;  &quot;At thispoint it is being handled by the FBI, and we're not providing any additionaldetails,&quot; said Apple spokeswoman Carleen LeVasseur.andM;At least two other programmers were also questioned last month by the FBI:Richard Stallman, head of the League for Programming Freedom, a Cambridge,Mass.-based group opposed to proprietary user interfaces, and Chuck Farnham,a Silicon Valley-based Mac enthusiast who has in the past disclosedinformation about unannounced Apple products.andM;Farnham said last week that two FBI agents, posing as reporters from theUnited Press International news service, questioned him in early Novemberabout the nuPrometheus League but did not say whether he was a suspect in theinvestigation.andP;  n</TEXT></DOC>
