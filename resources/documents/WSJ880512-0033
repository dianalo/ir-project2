The government sold $8.75 billion of 10-year Treasury notes at an average annual yield of 9.06%, the highest auction average in about 2 1/2 years. That was in line with what traders had expected. But there still is widespread uncertainty about how investors will react to today's auction of $8.5 billion of 30-year Treasury bonds.    &quot;There are very few reasons now to look for lower rates, and the list of reasons to expect higher rates has grown,&quot; said William Gibson, executive vice president at Continental Illinois National Bank andamp; Trust Co. of Chicago. He also expects additional credit-tightening moves in coming months by the Federal Reserve System in an effort to keep inflation under control.    Many Japanese investors agree. &quot;We don't think it's time to put money in the U.S. Treasury market because we expect interest rates to go up slightly in the near future,&quot; said Toshihiro Hirose, manager of the foreign securities investment division at Sumitomo Life Insurance Co. in Tokyo. Still, he and other money managers said they might buy Treasury bonds for short-term trading opportunities.    Prices of some long-term Treasury issues yesterday finished with declines of about a quarter of a point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount. Corporate bonds also edged lower, while municipals were little changed. Mortgage-backed securities prices were unchanged to slightly higher.    Masaru Shidara, senior managing director in charge of international investments for Nippon Life Insurance Co., Japan's biggest, said he hasn't decided whether to buy 30-year Treasury bonds at today's sale. But he conceded that the company's interest in U.S. Treasurys was &quot;mainly in the secondary market, not the primary market.&quot;    Mr. Shidara said he felt the secondary market for Treasury bonds offered the life insurance company more flexibility when deciding to buy for long-term investment purposes. &quot;People who want to purchase from the auction mostly seek to buy for trading purposes,&quot; he noted.    Yesterday's sale of 10-year notes &quot;came as expected,&quot; said William Brachfeld, executive vice president at Daiwa Securities America Inc. Susan Hering, a vice president at Salomon Brothers Inc., agreed: &quot;Participants weren't particularly disappointed or enthused by the results. The market anticipated the results pretty well.&quot;    Yesterday's prime-rate increase by major U.S. banks had little effect on the bond markets because traders had expected it. Led by Chase Manhattan, many banks raised their prime, or base, rate to 9% from 8 1/2%. Banks blamed the increase mainly on recent increases in their own borrowing costs. They also noted that the Fed this week tightened its credit hold slightly in its continuing battle to convince investors of its determination to combat inflation.    Federal Reserve Activity   The Federal Reserve yesterday provided clearer signals of the extent of its recent credit-tightening move.    The central bank has increased the interest rate on federal funds, or reserves that banks lend each other overnight, by about 1/4 of a percentage point, according to economists surveyed by the Dow Jones Capital Markets Report. Previously, some analysts thought the Fed might be pushing the funds rate up even further.    Analysts said the Fed now appears to be aiming for a funds rate between 7% and 7 1/8%. That is up from the funds rate's previous range between 6 3/4% and 6 7/8%.    The Fed yesterday arranged two-day repurchase agreements for its own account. At the time, the funds rate was 7 3/16%. The Fed maneuver &quot;should alleviate concern that funds will be as high as 7 1/4%,&quot; said Marilyn Schaja, a money market economist at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp.    The Fed's action &quot;certainly is supportive of the view&quot; that funds will trade in the 7% to 7 1/8% range, agreed James Winder, an economist at Merrill Lynch.    Treasury Securities   Today's sale of new 30-year Treasury bonds may go more smoothly than expected because of speculation that the government won't be able to sell any more such bonds for many months, according to analysts surveyed by the Dow Jones Capital Markets Report.    The $8.5 billion bond sale will, for all practical purposes, exhaust the government's authority to issue such bonds. The department won't be able to sell a normal-sized 30-year issue at its next quarterly refunding in August without congressional action.    Many market observers agree the chances that Congress will extend the Treasury's authority to issue long-term bonds in time for the August refunding is, at best, 50-50. The Treasury's long-term bond authority &quot;isn't a burning issue for Congress,&quot; although lawmakers are well aware of the need for it, said Nancy Vanden Houton, a Merrill Lynch economist in New York.    The Treasury's 8 7/8% bonds due 2017 were quoted late yesterday at a price of 96 20/32, down from 96 27/32 Tuesday. The yield rose to 9.21% from 9.19% Tuesday. Several dealers estimated late yesterday that the average annual yield on the 30-year bonds to be auctioned today will be between 9 1/8% and 9 1/4%.    An index of long-term Treasury issues, compiled by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., fell 1.70 point to 1225.77. It ranged between 1224.74 and 1232.26.    E. Craig Coats Jr., a managing director of Salomon Brothers Inc., estimated that Japanese investors bought $4.6 billion to $4.7 billion of the $8.75 billion of 10-year Treasury notes sold yesterday. &quot;The key is whether the Japanese will be involved&quot; in the government's sale of 30-year bonds today, he said.    &quot;If we had trouble attracting U.S. money managers to 10-year notes yielding 9.06%, we could have the same problem for 30-year bonds&quot; yielding 0.1 to 0.15 percentage point more, he said.    Rates fell on short-term Treasury bills. The rate on three-month bills declined to 6.21% bid from 6.34%, while six-month bills fell to 6.42% bid from 6.47%.    Here are details of yesterday's sale of 10-year Treasury notes:   Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.                          10-Year Notes    Applications                           $22,886,344,000    Accepted bids                           $8,751,314,000    Accepted at low price                              95%    Accepted noncompetitively                 $454,000,000    Average price (Rate)                     99.610(9.06%)    High price (Rate)                        99.675(9.05%)    Low price (Rate)                         99.610(9.06%)    Interest rate                                       9%    The notes are dated May 16 and mature May 15, 1998.   Corporate Issues   Corporate bond prices inched lower in light trading.   The volume of new issues has fallen because companies don't want to compete with the Treasury this week. Many investment bankers expect a renewed surge of corporate bond issues once the government's quarterly financing operation is over.   Two issues of floating-rate securities were launched yesterday, and dealers say more such issues are on the way. The issuers were First Federal of Michigan and Heller Financial Inc.   &quot;Some investors are becoming more defensive about the percentage of fixed-income securities in their portfolios,&quot; one syndicate manager said. &quot;They're diversifying with floaters.&quot;   Municipals   Municipal bond prices finished at about the same levels as Tuesday in a lackluster session.   Tax-exempts have outperformed Treasury issues lately as the supply of new municipals has remained low while the Treasury market is adjusting to the government's quarterly financing operation.   The June municipal bond futures contract settled 2/32 higher at 85-25, while the June T-bond contract ended 5/32 lower at 87-07.   Investors yesterday reacted enthusiastically to two new issues, according to underwriters. One was a $100 million issue by the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority, known as MARTA. Only about $5 million remained unsold as of late yesterday, underwriters said.   Mortgage-Backed Securities   Mortgage-backed securities also were little changed yesterday in thin activity.   During the past few months, the difference in yields between mortgage securities and Treasurys has narrowed to the lowest levels in more than a year. Traders said this reflects consistently strong sales of Remics, or real estate mortgage investment conduits.   The spread between some benchmark mortgage-backed issues and Treasurys has fallen to about 1.03 percentage points from 1.21 percentage points six weeks ago, according to the Dow Jones Capital Markets Report.   Foreign Bonds   Japanese government bond prices tumbled yesterday. But West German government issues were little changed, while British gilts drifted slightly lower.   The Japanese bond slump came amid fears of world-wide interest rate increases. Those worries came after remarks by Nigel Lawson, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, about the possibility of coordinated rate increases by leading Western industrial nations.   But a later clarification of Mr. Lawson's remarks damped speculation about the chances for further rate boosts. The yield on the Japanese government's benchmark 5% issue due November 1997 rose to 4.765% from 4.625%.   In West Germany, trading volume slowed to a trickle. Most issues recovered from a shaky start to close little changed. The government's 6 1/4% issue due 1998 finished the day yielding 6.62%, unchanged from Tuesday.   In London, gilts ended well above their session lows after a relatively firm early performance by U.S. Treasury bonds.</TEXT></DOC>
