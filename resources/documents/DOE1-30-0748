Similar techniques which have been used to measure atmosphericpollutants are discussed. These techniques include adsorption, Ramanscattering and fluorescence. While differential adsorption and Ramanscattering techniques have potential there are a number of problems tobe resolved before they could be applied effectively. It is felt thatan area which may provide suitable technology sometime in the futureis in the field of laser sources. 6 refs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
