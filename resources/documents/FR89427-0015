This final rule has also been reviewed with regard to the requirementsof the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612). Pursuant to thisreview, Mr. G. Scott Dunn, the Acting Administrator of the Food and NutritionService, has certified that this rule does not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities. No new reporting and recordkeeping requirements are included in this finalrule, and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval under the PaperworkReduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507) was therefore not required. This programis listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.559and is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requiresintergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (7 CFR Part3015, Subpart V, and final rule-related notice published at 48 FR 29114,June 24, 1983). <ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>The SFSP is authorized by section 13 of the National School Lunch Act (42U.S.C. 1761). Section 13(g) of that Act requires the Department to issueregulations for the Program each fiscal year. On November 30, 1988, theDepartment published a proposed rule (53 FR 48369) setting forth the proposedSFSP regulations for 1989. That proposed rule included a complete reorganizationof 7 CFR Part 225 which was intended to resolve any ambiguities or inconsistenciesin the regulations; eliminate unnecessary, duplicative, and obsolete provisions;and clarify the regulations' language, style, and organization so thatPart 225 would be more easily understood. In addition, the Department proposedto change the definition of ``sponsor'' to conform to the terms of Pub.L. 100-435, the Hunger Prevention Act of 1988. Finally, the Departmentalso proposed several discretionary clarifications of and changes to theProgram regulations governing food service management companies, weekendmeal service, letter of credit procedures, overclaims against sponsors,administrative funding reviews, and other aspects of the Program. Theseclarifications and changes were proposed in order to improve program accountabilityand management. The Department received a total of 25 comments on the proposed regulations.Commenters included State agencies, Program sponsors, advocacy groups,and other interested parties. All comments received were carefully consideredand the issues raised by them are discussed in this preamble to the finalrule. Before analyzing these comments in detail, it is appropriate to mentionthat several commenters questioned the adequacy of the comment period forthe proposed regulation. These commenters believed that the reorganizationand the other changes to the regulations which were proposed required morethan 30 days to review. One commenter, for example, believed that the changescontained in the proposed rule constituted a ``major re-examination ofSFSP regulations'' and, as such, called for a 90-day comment period. Anothercommenter expressed concern that the regulations had not been publisheduntil the end of November and believed that final regulations would notbe promulgated in time to be implemented in the 1989 Program. While the Department understands commenters' desire to have additionaltime to consider and respond to the proposed regulations, it is importantto note that section 13 of the National School Lunch Act mandates a deadlinefor publication of the final SFSP regulation which is only 60 days afterthe required date of publication for the proposed regulation. This veryshort period necessitates that a 30-day comment period be utilized exceptunder the most extraordinary circumstances. The Department does not believethat the reorganization and the other changes and clarifications whichwere proposed constituted a ``major re-examination'' of the SFSP regulations.Almost all of the changes proposed were, in fact, clarifications of extantProgram requirements. Furthermore, the Department believes that this final regulation is beingpublished early enough to allow for implementation during the current Programyear. The Department realizes that the date of publication of this finalregulation makes it impossible to implement the required changes to theState Management and Administration plans for the 1989 Program, and hastherefore added regulatory language which delays implementation of theseprovisions until 1990. Had the Department allowed a longer period for comment,most of the other provisions in this final regulation could not have beenimplemented in this year's Program. For all of these reasons, a 30-dayperiod was the maximum amount of time which could be allotted for comments.I. Reorganization of Part 225 The Department received nine (9) comments on the proposed reorganizationand related revisions, all of which were favorable. In order to assistusers of these final regulations, a redesignation table has again beenincluded at the end of this preamble which lists both the current and revisedlocation of each paragraph in Part 225. This table should provide readerswith a convenient overview of the reorganization and enable them to moreeasily locate specific parts of the old and new regulations. One commenterbelieved that andSection; 225.4(k) in the old regulations was erroneouslyredesignated as andSection; 225.5(f) in the proposed regulation. However,the Department did intend to redesignate former andSection; 225.4(k) as andSection;225.5(f) in the proposed rule, not andSection; 225.6(f) as the commenterbelieved. Several commenters pointed out areas which they believed were changed inadvertentlyduring the course of the Department's reorganization and stylistic revisionof the regulations. These areas are discussed in detail in Part IV of thispreamble, ``Other Comments on Part 225.'' The Department believes thatthe real test of the new regulations' utility will come when they are usedin next year's Program, and that users of the regulations may continueto find portions of the reorganized and revised Part 225 which they believeto be in error. The Department requests that users of the regulations submitto their state agency or regional office, as appropriate, any suggestionsfor additional organizational and stylistic improvements. These suggestionswill be considered by the Department when it prepares future revisionsand reissuances of the regulations. Accordingly, this final rulemaking includes the reorganization of 7 CFRPart 225 as presented in the proposed rule. Stylistic revisions and technicalcorrections to the regulation language are discussed in Part IV of thispreamble below.II. Mandatory Change to Part 225As explained in the preamble to the proposed rule, section 213 of the HungerPrevention Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-435) mandated that public and privatenonprofit colleges and universities be allowed to participate in the SFSPas sponsors provided that they are currently participating in the NationalYouth Sports Program (NYSP) and that they meet the other requirements forProgram sponsorship. Public universities offering the NYSP were alreadyallowed to participate in the SFSP as governmental sponsors; private collegesoffering the NYSP, however, were previously barred from SFSP sponsorshipdue to the general ban on most private nonprofit SFSP sponsors resultingfrom the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (Pub. L. 97-35).The Department received six comments on its proposed implementation ofthis provision. Four commenters agreed with the Department's proposal,one disagreed, and another raised questions regarding these sponsors' participationwhich were not specifically addressed in the preamble to the proposed regulation.Although the implementation of this provision is non-discretionary, theDepartment nevertheless believes that the objection and question raisedmerit consideration in this preamble.The commenter who disagreed with the Department's proposed implementationof this provision of the Hunger Prevention Act believed that the NYSP servedwealthy children who did not need SFSP benefits. In fact, the NYSP, whichis administered by the National Collegiate Athletic Association throughgrants provided by the Department of Health and Human Services, is designedto provide supervised sports training and competition for low-income children.As a program designed for low-income children, Congress apparently feltthat the NYSP serves the same population which the SFSP is designed toserve, and that the ban on SFSP sponsorship by private nonprofit collegesand universities should be modified in this particular instance.The questions raised about implementation of this new provision involved:(a) Whether public and private nonprofit colleges and universities currentlyparticipating in the NYSP would be permitted to sponsor the Program atnon-NYSP sites; and (b) whether these same colleges and universities wouldbe eligible to participate in the SFSP if they elected <T3>not </T3>to have their NYSP site(s) participate in the NYSP. Even beforepassage of the Hunger Prevention Act, public colleges and universitiesoffering the NYSP were eligible to sponsor the SFSP as entities of Stategovernment. Thus, public colleges and universities are eligible to participatein the SFSP without reference to their participation in the NYSP and mayoffer the Program at non-NYSP sites.Private nonprofit colleges and universities, on the other hand, can onlyparticipate as SFSP sponsors if they currently participate in the NYSP.In addition, these private nonprofit colleges and universities may claimSFSP reimbursement only for meals served to NYSP participants.Accordingly, as previously proposed, this final rule amends andSection;andSection;225.2and 225.14(b) to allow public and private nonprofit colleges and universitiesparticipating in the NYSP to be SFSP sponsors.Finally, as noted in the preamble to the proposed regulation, section 213of Pub. L. 100-435 also mandated that the Department conduct a pilot projectto assess the feasibility of again allowing other types of private nonprofitorganizations to sponsor the SFSP. The Department received three commentsspecifically concerning this demonstration project and five other commentsregarding the advisability of readmitting other types of private nonprofitorganizations to SFSP sponsorship. Because the demonstration project isjust beginning and has no bearing on the issues addressed in this finalregulation, the Department will not respond to these comments in this preamble.III. Substantive Changes to Part 225<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Food Service Management Companies</ITAG>The Department received 17 comments from nine different commenters on theproposed clarifications of the regulations pertaining to food service managementcompanies (FSMCs). These clarifications addressed: the differences between``vended'' and ``self-preparation'' sponsors, especially with respect tothe added administrative reimbursement earned by self-preparation sponsors;the definition of an FSMC; the practical application of the regulatoryprohibition on contracting out for the management responsibilities of theprogram; whether colleges and universities with year-round FSMC contractsare required to conduct new procurements for their SFSP meal service; whethercolleges and universities acting as FSMCs are exempt from registrationrequirements; and the form of the bid and performance bonds required tobe submitted by FSMCs.1. <T3>Self-Preparation Sponsors and Payment of the Higher AdministrativeReimbursement. </T3>The Department received five comments on its proposalto clarify when sponsors should be considered ``self-preparation sponsors''and be entitled to receive a higher rate of administrative reimbursement.This clarification involved the proposed amendment of the definitions of``self-preparation sponsor'' and ``food service management company'' andthe addition of a new definition (``vended sponsor'') at andSection;225.2.Although none of the commenters disagreed with the Department's premise_thatthere should be a clearer differentiation between vended and self-preparationsponsors in the regulations_four of the commenters believed that the distinctionwhich the Department attempted to make in the proposed regulations wasstill confusing. A sponsor from a large metropolitan area, for example,stated that it still did not know whether it would be considered self-preparationor vended and asked whether the distinction between these two types ofsponsors is simply whether the sponsor purchases meal components or anentire meal from an FSMC. Another commenter suggested that, in order tofurther clarify the distinction between vended and self-preparation sponsors,the Department replace the phrase ``some or all of its unitized meals,with or without milk'' in the definition of vended sponsor with the phrase``entire unitized meals, with or without milk, for some or all of the childrenserved.'' Finally, another commenter pointed out that andSection;225.9(d)(7)(iii)allows for payment of the higher administrative reimbursement at self-preparationor rural sites, and believed that the proposed change would prevent a sponsorfrom collecting the additional reimbursement if it served even a singlemeal purchased from an FSMC at a single site.The Department's intent <T3>was</T3> to differentiate between sponsors which purchase from a FSMCentire unitized meals, with or without milk, and sponsors which purchasea portion of a meal (for example, a pre-made sandwich) from a food vendorwho happens to be registered as a FSMC. The Department also intended toclarify that a sponsor could not be considered ``self-preparation'' ifit purchased food management services from a FSMC, regardless of whetheror not it purchased unitized meals from that management company.The Department did not, however, intend to impose an undue burden on sponsorswith some self-preparation and some vended sites, nor did it intend todiscourage sponsors with mostly self-preparation sites from administeringone or more vended sites. The Department believes that, consistent withthe language at andSection; 225.9(d)(7)(iii), State agencies already possessthe authority to approve sponsors' claims for the higher administrativereimbursement at self-preparation sites, in the rare event that the sponsoradministers both self-preparation and vended sites. The Department would,however, caution State agencies to use extra care in ensuring that sponsorswhose claims include both types of sites are not improperly claiming theself-preparation rate for sites receiving vended meals.Furthermore, the Department agrees with the comment that the ``some orall'' language in the definition of vended sponsor could still leave opento question the very issue that the proposed regulation was intended tosettle_that sponsors which purchase a portion of their meal from a vendorregistered as a FSMC may still be considered self-preparation sponsors.The definition of ``vended sponsor'' has therefore been amended in thisfinal regulation to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="20">``</ITAG><T3>Vended sponsor</T3>'' means a sponsor which purchases from a food servicemanagement company the unitized meals, with or without milk, which it willserve at its site(s), or a sponsor which purchases management services,subject to the limitations set forth in andSection; 225.15, from a food servicemanagement company.Accordingly, the definitions of ``food service management company'' and``self-preparation sponsor'' which were presented in the proposed ruleare contained in this final rule at andSection; 225.2. In addition, the reviseddefinition of ``vended sponsor'' set forth above is included in this finalrule at andSection; 225.2.2. <T3>Prohibition on Contracting Out Management Responsibilities.</T3> TheDepartment received four comments on its proposal to clarify that sponsorswhich contract with FSMCs must retain full responsibility for the performanceof all of their duties as sponsors except for the management of their foodservice operations. Previously, the definition of ``food service managementcompany'' seemed to contradict the regulations' prohibition on a sponsorcontracting with an FSMC ``for the management responsibilities of the Programsuch as monitoring, enforcing corrective action, or preparing Program applications''.All of the commenters agreed with the ways in which the Department proposedto clarify this issue in the proposed regulation: to change the words ``foodservice program'' to ``food service operations'' in the definition of FSMCat andSection; 225.2; and to list more fully the management responsibilitieswhich FSMCs <T3>may not</T3> perform at andSection; 225.15.Accordingly, this final regulation includes the revised definition of ``foodservice management company'' as set forth in the proposed regulation atandSection; 225.2 and the list of management functions which sponsors maynot delegate to FSMCs at andSection; 225.15.3. <T3>Food Service Management Company Procurements.</T3> The Department received7 comments on its proposals to clarify two aspects of the regulations pertainingto colleges and universities participating in the SFSP: (1) Whether thesecolleges and universities, when they are sponsors with year-round FSMCcontracts, are required to conduct a separate procurement for their SFSPmeal service; and (2) whether these colleges and universities, when theyact as FSMCs for SFSP sponsors, are required to go through the registrationprocess prescribed for most other FSMCs at andSection; 225.6(g)(9).In the proposed regulations, the Department clarified that when collegesand universities act as FSMCs, they are not required to comply with theregistration requirements set forth at andSection; 225.6(g)(9). The Departmentreceived two comments on this clarification, both of which were favorable.The proposed clarification of the bidding requirements for colleges anduniversities acting as sponsors also received generally favorable comment,with four commenters in support and one in opposition to the proposed changes.The commenter who disagreed objected to the wording of andSection; 225.15(g)(5),which states that, ``Sponsors which are schools or school food authoritieswhich have an exclusive contract with food service management companiesfor year-round service * * * shall not be required to comply with these[bid] procedures.'' This commenter believed that the exclusion from followingthe specific bid procedures mandated in andSection; 225.15(g)(5) should applyto all sponsors with year-round FSMC contracts.The Department does not believe, however, that such a broad exclusion fromthese bidding requirements would be warranted. Local schools and collegesand universities can logically be expected to have contracted for year-roundFSMCs since the bulk of their food operations occur at times of the yearwhen the SFSP is not in operation. The same cannot be said of other typesof sponsors_entities of government and residential camps_which primarilyoperate large-scale feeding programs during the summer months.It has come to the Department's attention that there was a minor omissionin the discussion of the procurement requirements pertaining to collegeand university sponsors in the preamble to the proposed rule. As set forthin the preamble, the Department intended to exclude <T3>all</T3> college and universities acting as SFSP sponsors from conductinga separate procurement for their SFSP feeding operations. However, as setforth in the revised definition of ``school food authority,'' the exclusionwould only apply to public colleges and universities acting as governmentalsponsors and public and private nonprofit colleges and universities participatingin the NYSP and the SFSP. This leaves uncertain the status of certain collegesand universities which sponsor the SFSP as residential camps via the UpwardBound Program. The preamble language implies that college sponsors of UpwardBound would not have to conduct a separate SFSP procurement, whereas thelanguage of the revised definition of ``school food authority'' would seemto require that such sponsors conduct a separate SFSP procurement.It was not the Department's intent to place colleges and universities participatingin the Upward Bound Program into a different category and require themto conduct separate procurements for their SFSP food operations. UpwardBound ``camp'' programs are generally held on-campus, with students residingin the college's dormitories and eating in the school cafeteria. Therefore,it would make no more sense for these colleges and universities to conducta separate procurement for the SFSP than it would for other types of collegeand university participants in the SFSP. With this in mind, the Departmenthas amended the proposed definition of ``School Food Authority'' at andSection;225.2 to clarify that all colleges and universities in the SFSP_regardlessof whether they participate as government sponsors, camp sponsors, or NYSPsponsors_are permitted to use their exclusive year-round FSMC contractsfor their SFSP feeding operations.Accordingly, with the minor change mentioned above, the Department hasincluded in this final regulation the amended definition of ``School FoodAuthority'' which was set forth in andSection; 225.2 of the proposed regulation.This revised definition will have the effect of allowing colleges and universitiesto be exempt from conducting a separate FSMC procurement for the SFSP ifthey already have a competitively procured year-round contract with anFSMC. This change will also exempt colleges or universities acting as foodservice management companies from the registration requirements at andSection;225.6(g)(9).4. <T3>Performance and Bid Bonds.</T3> The Department received one favorablecomment on its proposal to clarify that ``alternative'' forms of the bidand performance bonds required by andSection; 225.15(g)(8) (e.g., certifiedchecks, cash, escrow accounts, or letters of credit) are not acceptableunder the SFSP regulations. Accordingly, this final regulation includesthe clarifying language in andSection; 225.15(g)(8) as it appeared in theproposed regulation.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Weekend Meals</ITAG>The Department received 13 comments on its proposal to clarify that reimbursementis not allowed for Program meals served on weekend days except in residentialcamps. Three commenters favored the proposal while 10 either opposed itoutright or urged that it be modified.The responses were wide in variety and ranged from questions of Congressionalintent to suggestions that other types of sponsors be permitted to receivereimbursement for weekend meals.The numerous proposals received on this issue have demonstrated the needfor further study on this issue. Consequently, the Department will not,at this time, make final the amendatory language set forth in the proposedrule, and State agencies should follow their current practices in regardto weekend meals.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Overclaims for Inadequate Recordkeeping</ITAG>Seven commenters responded to the Department's clarification that a sponsor'sfailure to keep records documenting the basis of its claim for reimbursementconstitutes adequate cause for the assessment of an overclaim against thesponsor. Six commenters agreed with the proposal and one disagreed, althoughone of the commenters in agreement raised concerns over potential implementationdifficulties. These concerns involved the possibility that the proposedregulation language had ``the potential to be misapplied or abused by overzealousor misguided State agency personnel.'' This commenter felt that it wouldbe easy for a sponsor to misfile or misplace one site's records when thesponsor was administering dozens of sites, or that records which alreadyhad been checked as part of a State review could be misplaced or inadvertentlydestroyed during the required three-year recordkeeping period. Due to theseconcerns, the commenter recommended that overclaims should only be permittedwhen there is a ``pattern'' of fraud or inadequate recordkeeping. Finally,this commenter also suggested that the revised wording of andSection; 225.12(a)be as specific as that of andSection;andSection; 225.15(c)(1) and 225.9(d)(4)and state that the records which the sponsor must keep are those ``whichjustify all costs and meals claimed.''The Department agrees that the revised language of andSection; 225.12(a)should fully conform to the language of the other Sections cited and willmake the suggested modification to the wording of andSection; 225.12(a).However, the Department does not share the commenter's apparent concernthat State agencies will misapply this rule. Changing the proposed regulatorylanguage to require that a ``pattern'' of fraud or abuse exist before initiationof an overclaim would not clarify what constitutes a ``pattern'' and wouldnot eliminate the possibility of misapplication of the rule. However, inthe rare event that unwarranted overclaims are lodged against the sponsor,the Department believes that the sponsor is adequately protected by itsappeal rights under andSection; 225.13(a).The commenter who disagreed with the proposal in principle believed that,when a sponsor lacked records to document a claim, this lack of recordswas more likely to be the result of a State agency's failure to properlytrain the sponsor than <T3>prima facie</T3> evidence of fraud, waste, or abuse on the sponsor'spart. This commenter further believed that ``alternative documentation,including affidavits from parents or some other record'', should constituteacceptable proof that the sponsor actually provided the number of mealsclaimed.The Department agrees that inadequate recordkeeping may be unintentionaland does not necessarily indicate that the sponsor intended to defraudthe government or waste federal resources. Nevertheless, it is not logicalto assume that every sponsor who fails to keep records is the victim ofpoor State agency training, unless there is a pattern of sponsor recordkeepingproblems within that State. Furthermore, the Department does not believethat ``alternative documentation'' is a practical substitute for adequateProgram recordkeeping, since collecting and determining the accuracy ofsuch ``alternative documentation'' would be extremely time-consuming andcostly to State agencies.Accordingly, with the exception of the minor change to andSection; 225.12(a)discussed above, this final regulation includes the proposed regulation'slanguage in andSection;andSection; 225.15(c)(1), 225.9(d)(4) and 225.12(a)which clarifies that, if a sponsor fails to keep records which adequatelydocument the basis of all costs and meals claimed, the State agency maylodge an overclaim against the sponsor.<ITAG tagnum="81">D. Letter of Credit (LOC) for Program Payments</ITAG>The Department received two comments on its proposal to provide FNS withadditional time for providing the 65 percent level of LOC funding whena State agency submits its required management and administration plan(MAP) after the February 15 deadline. Both of these comments were favorable.Accordingly, the Department is amending andSection;225.5(d)(2) as set forthin the proposed regulation.One statement made in this section of the preamble to the proposed regulationrequires additional clarification. In the proposed regulation, a typographicalerror resulted in a statement which could be misconstrued. The sentencewhich stated that, ``FNS should have 90 days to review, ask for modificationsof, and approve the MAP between the time the MAP is submitted and the timeby which the State agency must have 65 percent of its estimated Programpayment needs in the LOC'' incorrectly implied that there is a 90-day periodfor FNS to review and approve a MAP. Section 225.4(b) clearly requiresFNS to review a MAP within 30 days of submission. The statement shouldhave referred to the 90-day period between the deadline for a State agency'ssubmission of the MAP and the deadline by which FNS must, based on theMAP, adjust the LOC to ensure that the State agency has received 65 percentof its estimated administrative and operating funding for the current year.<ITAG tagnum="81">E. MAP Requirements</ITAG>Four commenters responded to the Department's proposal to require Stateagencies to include in their MAPs their plans for carrying out the specialmonitoring responsibilities in andSection;225.15 pertaining to food servicemanagement company (FSMC) procurements over $100,000 in value. One commenteragreed with this proposal while three disagreed. Of those disagreeing,one commenter seemed to believe that the performance of these monitoringresponsibilities was a new requirement (in fact, these requirements previouslyappeared at former andSection;225.16(d)(7) and (g)), while another commenterbelieved that the requirement to discuss monitoring actions in the MAPwould be meaningless since State agencies would not know which sponsorswould have large FSMC procurements at the time of their MAP submissions.The Department understands that, at the time of the State agency's MAPsubmission, it cannot know which sponsors and how many sponsors will haveFSMC contracts exceeding $100,000 in value. The requirement to addressthese monitoring responsibilities in the MAP will necessarily be basedon the prior year's Program and will not reflect the actual number andlocation of procurements requiring special monitoring in the current year.Nevertheless, the Department is aware of instances where some State agencieshave failed to perform these functions, resulting in bid protests and irregularities.Therefore, the Department continues to believe that the Program will benefitfrom the requirement to have State agencies budget staff time and resourcesfor these monitoring functions in their annual MAPs.Accordingly, this final regulation amends andSection;225.4(d) by adding arequirement that the State agency's MAP include its plans for performingthe special FSMC procurement monitoring functions specified at andSection;andSection;225.15(g)(5)(xiii) and 225.6(h)(4), respectively. However, due to thisfinal regulation's publication date, regulatory language has been addedto specify that this information will not be a required element of a Stateagency's MAP until 1990.<ITAG tagnum="81">F. Health Inspection Funds</ITAG>The Department received six comments on its proposal to require State agenciesto document in their MAPs the need for funding to carry out health inspectionsand related functions prior to FNS's placement of these funds in the State'sletter of credit (LOC). Four commenters disagreed with this proposal andtwo commenters agreed.One commenter who disagreed with the proposal believed that it representedan attempt to evade section 13(k)(3) of the National School Lunch Act,which requires the Department to ``make available'' health inspection andmeal quality testing monies to the States. The preamble to the proposedregulation attempted to make clear that this was not the Department's intent.Rather, the Department's proposal was designed to rationalize an inefficientadministrative procedure whereby health inspection monies are put intoa State's LOC, then later withdrawn, even when the State did not anticipatea need for health inspection funding during the current fiscal year. Thus,the Department proposed to ``make available'' the funding by placing itin the LOC only when the State's MAP documented a later need for the funding.Although it was not explicitly stated in the preamble to the proposed regulation,the Department would of course also make such funds available to Stateagencies which discovered, after the submission of their MAPs, that theywould, in fact, require such funding.The other three commenters who disagreed with the proposal believed thatthe Department needed to clarify whether it now intended to require Stateagencies to seek free health inspection services or to prove the need forpaid health inspections. The Department assumes that State agencies wouldseek free services from State and local health departments whenever possible,but did not intend to ``require'' States to do so or to ``prove'' thatthey had done so. The Department agrees with the commenter who suggestedthat the Department clarify its intent in this regard by changing the regulatorylanguage which was proposed. Rather than requiring States to ``document''the need for these monies, this commenter believed that the States shouldbe required to ``estimate'' their need for the monies in the MAP. Sincethe MAP is a planning document in which one can only make estimates offunding needs, the Department concurs and has changed the wording of andSection;andSection;225.4(d)(14) and 225.5(f) to conform with this suggestion.Accordingly, this final rule incorporates in andSection;andSection;225.4(d)(14)and 225.5(f) the requirement that States include in their MAPs an estimateof the amount of funding they will need in the current year to performhealth inspections and meal quality tests. As noted above, the wordingof this requirement in these two Sections has been modified slightly inorder to convey more accurately the Department's intent in initiating thisrequirement. In addition, due to this final regulation's publication date,regulatory language has been added to specify that this information willnot be a required element of a State agency's MAP until 1990.<ITAG tagnum="81">G. Administrative Funding Reviews</ITAG>The proposed rulemaking included several clarifications of the requirementspertaining to the conduct of administrative funding reviews. The Departmentreceived three comments on these changes, all of which were favorable.Accordingly, the clarifications of the procedures governing these reviewswhich were included in the proposed rule are adopted without change atandSection;225.5 of this final regulation.<ITAG tagnum="81">H. Definition of ``Special Account''</ITAG>The Department received one favorable comment on its proposal to changethe definition of a ``special account'' at andSection;225.2 of the regulations.Accordingly, this final regulation includes the definition of a ``specialaccount'' at andSection;225.2 as set forth in the proposed rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="81">I. Deletion of Statistical Monitoring for Site Reviews</ITAG>The Department received four comments on its proposed deletion of formerandSection; 225.9(e)(8) of the regulations which permitted State agenciesto use ``statistical monitoring procedures in lieu of the site monitoringrequirements prescribed in paragraph (e)(2) of this section * * *.'' Twoof the commenters agreed with this proposed change to the regulations whiletwo commenters disagreed.Although the Department had assumed that statistical monitoring procedureswere not being used by the States, one State agency commenter stated thatit had used such procedures successfully for ten years and that overclaimsbased on these techniques had not been challenged or overturned. The secondcommenter who disagreed with the Department stated that it would use statisticalmonitoring techniques if the Department would issue updated guidance onthem.The Department is still not convinced that it is appropriate to committhe resources necessary to reissue this guidance simply because one Stateagency is using these techniques and another is considering the possibilityof doing so. Neither, however, does it seem appropriate to eliminate statisticalmonitoring as a possible alternative without further consideration if itis being used successfully. Therefore, the Department has in this finalregulation re-inserted language which offers State agencies the optionof utilizing statistical monitoring techniques. The Department will continueto study statistical monitoring's feasibility as a means of fulfillinga State agency's monitoring responsibilities and will address the subjectagain, if necessary, in a future reissuance of the regulations.Accordingly, this final regulation restores at andSection; 225.7(d)(8) languagewhich permits State agencies to use statistical monitoring techniques inlieu of the site monitoring requirements set forth at andSection; 225.7(d)(2).The reinsertion of this paragraph means that the paragraph redesignatedas andSection; 225.7(d)(8) (``Corrective Actions'') in the proposed regulationnow becomes andSection; 225.7(d)(9) in this final regulation.<ITAG tagnum="81">J. Media Release for Camps and other Enrolled Sites</ITAG>The Department received five comments, all of which were favorable, onits proposal to require the media release issued by camps and other enrolledsites to list only the family size and income standards for reduced pricemeals. Accordingly, this final regulation amends andSection; 225.15(e) byrequiring that the media release issued by camps and other enrolled siteslist only the Secretary's guidelines for reduced price eligibility andthat these guidelines be labelled ``Summer Food Service Program EligibilityStandards.''In addition, the proposed rule would also change the definition of ``documentation''at andSection; 225.2 to conform to the change in the media release by removingthe phrase ``free and reduced price application'' and substituting in itsplace the words ``free meal application.'' Several commenters found otherparts of the regulatory language containing wording which required revisionin light of the changes being made to the media release and the definitionof documentation. These include andSection; 225.6(c)(3)(ii)(A) and the definitionof ``income standards'' at andSection; 225.2.Accordingly, the wording of the definitions of ``documentation'' and ``incomestandards'' at andSection; 225.2 and the regulatory language at andSection;225.6(c)(3)(ii)(A) are modified in this final regulation to eliminate referencesto free meal income standards and to conform to the usage in the mediarelease as set forth in the proposed rule.<ITAG tagnum="81">K. Record Retention by Food Service Management Companies</ITAG>The Department received three comments on its proposal to require foodservice management companies to retain their Program records for the sameamount of time as State agencies and sponsors. All of these commentersfavored the proposed change.Accordingly, this final rulemaking amends andSection; 225.6(h)(2)(vii) toclarify that food service management companies are also required to retaintheir Program records for more than three years when there are unresolvedaudit or investigative findings pertaining to the company or to a sponsorwith which the company contracted.IV. Other Comments on Part 225Because the proposed rulemaking represented the first comprehensive reissuanceof Part 225 since 1982, a number of commenters took the opportunity tooffer input to the Department on topics other than those which were addressedin the preamble to the proposed rule. These additional comments are addressedbelow under four separate headings: (1) Comments on Provisions Mandatedby Law; (2) Comments on Recently-Revised Provisions; (3) Stylistic andTechnical Corrections; and (4) Miscellaneous Comments.<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Comments on Provisions Mandated by Law</ITAG>Commenters submitted suggested changes to the regulations governing thedefinition of area eligibility at andSection; 225.2; the mandatory submissionby State agencies of a management and administrative plan at andSection;225.4; the adequacy of the State administrative funding formula at andSection;225.5(a); the use of Program funds to support nonprofit nutrition programsfor the elderly; and the time restrictions on meal service set forth atandSection; 225.16(c)(2). The first four of these are directly mandated bysections 13(a)(1)(C), 13(n), 13(k)(1), and 12(i) of the National SchoolLunch Act, respectively; the last of these requirements is derived fromthe language of section 13(b)(2) of that Act, which limits the types andnumber of reimbursable meals which different types of sponsors may offer.As legislative requirements, these provisions may not be altered by theDepartment unless Congress amends the National School Lunch Act, and theDepartment cannot meaningfully comment on them in this preamble.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Comments on Recently-Revised Provisions</ITAG>Four commenters submitted suggestions for changing regulatory provisionswhich have been amended in the past several years_the limitation on thenumber of ``second'' meals which may be claimed for reimbursement by sponsorsand the clarification of the application requirements for households whichare not categorically eligible for Program benefits.As stated in the preamble to the final regulation (51 FR 3321) which promulgatedthe two percent limitation on ``seconds'', the intent of the National SchoolLunch Act is to provide one meal to each participating child and that,even given some of the unique characteristics of SFSP feeding sites, theDepartment bears the responsibility for ensuring that second meals arecurtailed to the maximum extent practicable. In the three years since thisrule's publication, the Department has received several comments to theeffect that the two percent tolerance is too low and that it needs to beadjusted upward to anywhere from five to twenty percent. The Departmenthas no firm evidence that the rule has imposed an unwarranted burden onsponsors or that it has necessitated the denial of meals to children. Therefore,the Department is satisfied that the two percent tolerance strikes a balancebetween the important goals of providing meals to eligible children andensuring that the Federal funding which supports the SFSP is utilized effectivelyand efficiently.In regard to the application requirements for non-categorically eligiblehouseholds, the commenter apparently believed that the Department's finalrulemaking in 1988 (53 FR 4827) represented a departure from past applicationpractices. Specifically, this commenter believed that the Department'srequirement that applicant households list the income of each householdmember by source of income was burdensome and unnecessary. In fact, theregulatory language added at that time was merely intended to clarify theelements of a complete application in the Part 225 regulations and to bringthe SFSP application requirements into full conformance with the applicationrequirements set forth for all Child Nutrition Programs at section 9 ofthe National School Lunch Act. Commenters who provided the input on whichthe 1988 final regulation was based were generally aware that these requirementshad existed prior to the issuance of the final rule and favored makingthese requirements explicit in the regulations.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Stylistic Comments and Technical Corrections</ITAG>In the course of reorganizing and making stylistic and other revisionsin the proposed rulemaking, the Department in several cases inadvertentlychanged the meaning of the regulatory text. The Department wishes to thankthose commenters who brought these cases to its attention and urges usersof the regulation during the coming Program year to notify the Departmentimmediately if other apparent errors are discovered. Each of these errors,and the corrective action taken in this final rulemaking, is discussedbelow.In addition, in several cases, commenters brought to the Department's attentionpassages in the old regulations which were transferred verbatim into thenew regulation but which should have been revised in the proposed regulation.The Department believes that, because these are minor and non-controversialchanges, they may be made in the final rulemaking without having been setforth in the text to the proposed regulation. These changes are also discussedin detail below.1. <T3>Section 225.7(d)(2)(i).</T3> In revising the wording of this paragraph,which was formerly andSection;225.9(e)(2)(i), the Department inadvertentlydeleted wording which indicated that State agencies are required to conduct<T3>both</T3> a sponsor review and a review of an average of 15 percentof the sites for the types of sponsors specified at andSection;225.7(d)(2)(i)(A) and (B). Accordingly, the words ``conduct both a review of sponsor operations and''are reinserted at andSection;225.7(d)(2)(i) of this final rulemaking. 2. <T3>Section 225.16(f)(2).</T3> Redesignated andSection;225.16(f)(2) is basedon two paragraphs from the old regulations andSection;andSection;225.20 (d)and (e)), both of which detailed requirements pertaining to meal serviceto children under six years of age. Section 225.20(e), however, dealt onlywith meal service to children under one year of age, and required thatsponsors wishing to serve such children receive approval from the Stateagency to do so. This requirement was inadvertently omitted from the regulatorytext when the two paragraphs were combined.Accordingly, the requirement for State agencies to approve meal serviceto children under one year of age is restored in this final rulemakingby making it the second sentence of andSection;225.16(f)(2) and modifyingthe last sentence of the paragraph to read, ``In both cases, the sponsorshall follow * * *.''3. <T3>Section 225.16(c)(7).</T3> Section 225.16(c)(7) in the proposed rulemakingwas identical to andSection;225.20(a)(6), which stated that, ``The sponsorshall serve only the type(s) of meals for which it is approved under itsagreement with the State agency.'' Several commenters correctly noted thatsponsors may serve any meals they wish, but may claim for reimbursementonly those meals for which it is approved by the State agency.Accordingly, andSection;225.16(c)(7) is amended in this final rulemakingto clarify that sponsors may only claim for reimbursement those meals forwhich it is approved in its agreement with the State agency. 4. <T3>Section 225.6(c)(3)(ii).</T3> This section of the regulations was takenverbatim from former andSection;225.21(b), except that the specific hearingprocedures mandated by the regulations (formerly andSection;225.21(b)(4)(i)-(xii)) were moved to a separate, new paragraph which was redesignatedandSection;225.6(c)(4). The new andSection;225.6(c)(3)(ii) set forth six elementsrequired in policy statements submitted by camps and ``enrollment programs''.However, these six elements are irrelevant to enrollment programs because,after determining the eligibility of the enrolled site, all children atthat site receive a free meal. Thus, it is pointless for enrolled sitesto discuss in their policy statements their methods of collecting paymentsor of preventing overt identification of children receiving free meals.Accordingly, this final regulation amends the wording of the introductoryparagraph of andSection;225.6(c)(3)(ii) to clarify that the six requiredelements of a policy statement specified at andSection;225.6(c)(3)(ii) (A)-(F)apply to camps only and not to enrollment programs. 5. <T3>Section 225.6(c)(4).</T3> In revising this paragraph, which is basedon former andSection;225.21(b)(4), the Department inadvertently extendedto all sponsors a requirement that, in former andSection;225.21(b)(4), appliedonly to residential camps and enrollment programs. As discussed in number4 above, however, this requirement, too, should not have pertained to enrollmentprograms. It makes little sense to require such programs to submit copiesof their hearing procedures, since household applications are taken atenrolled sites only to establish the site's eligibility to serve mealsfree of charge.Accordingly, this final rulemaking amends the introductory paragraph toandSection;225.6(c)(4) to clarify that only residential camps are requiredto submit copies of their hearing procedures with their Program applications.6. <T3>Section 225.9(c).</T3> The introductory paragraph in andSection;225.9(c)in the proposed rulemaking was identical to the introductory paragraphin former Section 225.11(b). This portion of the regulations sets forththe general procedures for granting advance payments to sponsors. However,unlike the sections which describe start-up payments (andSection;225.9(a))and reimbursements for operating and administrative costs (andSection;225.9(d)),the section dealing with advance payments inadvertently fails to state,as do the sections dealing with start-up payments and reimbursements, thatsponsors may not receive advance payments <T3>unless</T3> they have executed an agreement with the State agency.Accordingly, andSection;225.9(c) is amended in this final rulemaking to includea sentence specifying that sponsors may not receive advance payments unlessthey have executed an agreement with the State agency to administer theProgram. <ITAG tagnum="81">D. Miscellaneous Comments</ITAG>Commenters also provided their input on numerous other areas of the Programregulations which were not modified in the proposed rulemaking but whichwere set forth as part of the overall reissuance of the Part 225 regulations.The number of regulatory provisions commented upon in this fashion wastoo numerous for the Department to respond to each in great detail. Nevertheless,the following provides (in a ``Suggestion/Response'' format) a brief responseto each of the commenters' suggestions.1. <T3>Audit Requirement in MAP (Section 225.4(d)(11))_Suggestion:</T3> Removefrom this section the words ``by auditing'', since there is no longer anaudit requirement for sponsors with reimbursements under $25,000.<T3>Response:</T3> The Department agrees. The language in the regulationis out of date. Accordingly, this final regulation amends andSection; 225.4(d)(11)to require that State agencies include in their MAPs their plans for ensuringsponsors' fiscal integrity. The means of accomplishing this (audit, financialreview, etc.) will be left to the State agency's discretion.2. <T3>Availability of Funds to State Agencies (Section 225.5(b)(1))_Suggestion:</T3>The regulations state that Program funds will be made available to Stateagencies at the beginning of the fiscal year, but they are often not madeavailable until six or more weeks into the fiscal year. Funds should bemade available at the beginning of the fiscal year.<T3>Response:</T3> These funds are made available to State agencies asearly as is legally possible. In past years, Program monies have oftennot been appropriated until several weeks or months into the fiscal year.State Administrative Expense (SAE) carryover should provide ample fundsfor States to operate the Program at the beginning of the fiscal year untilthe Department receives its appropriation.3. <T3>Site Information Requirements (Section 225.6(c)(2)(iii))_Comment:</T3>The commenter did not approve of the ``change'' to this Section. Accordingto the commenter, previous regulations only required camp sponsors to documentthe number of eligible campers on the first day of each session; the newregulations require earlier submission which, according to the commenter,will result in the submission of inaccurate information.<T3>Response:</T3> There is no inconsistency between the new wording_whichrequires the camp to provide the information ``as soon as possible'' aftersubmission of its application for sponsorship, but ``in no case later thanthe filing of the camp's claim for reimbursement for each session''_andthe old wording, which required submission ``prior to filing their claimsfor reimbursement for each session''. If the camp is capable of submittingthe information earlier than the first day of the session, it is requiredto do so; if this is not practical, then the information must be submittedto the State agency no later than the date on which the claim for thatsession is submitted.4.<T3> Site Caps (Section 225.6(d)(2))_Suggestion:</T3> Eliminate site capsor <T3>require</T3> State agencies to grant any requests from sponsors foran upward adjustment of their site caps.<T3>Response:</T3> The Department believes that the requirement for Stateagency approval of requests for upward adjustments is a prudent administrativeprocedure which helps to prevent the type of abuse which previously plaguedthe SFSP. The Department further believes that the site caps serve an importantpurpose in encouraging the sponsor and the State agency to work togetherclosely to develop reasonable estimates of anticipated site attendance.5. <T3>Off-Site Meal Consumption (Sections 225.6(e)(14), 225.11(c)(4)(vii))_Suggestion:</T3>End the prohibition on off-site meal consumption.<T3>Response:</T3> The Department strongly believes that the prohibitionon off-site meal consumption plays an important role in ensuring that Programbenefits are delivered to the children for whom they are intended.6. <T3>FSMC Registration Requirements (Section 225.6(g)(1))_Suggestion:</T3>If a State agency registers an FSMC which does not have production facilitiesin that State, that FSMC should not be permitted to bid on contracts withinthat State unless the sponsor has meal preparation facilities which theFSMC could utilize.<T3>Response:</T3> The Department assumes that, under current procurementprocedures, a company without production facilities would not be awardeda contract if it could not fulfill the meal production requirements ofthat contract. No regulatory change is neeeded.7. <T3>Procedures for Estimating Advances (Section 225.9(c)(3))_Comment:</T3>The commenter stated that he was in agreement with the ``change'' madeby the Department in the procedures for estimating advances.<T3>Response:</T3> No change was made. andSection; 225.9(c)(3) is a verbatimrestatement of former andSection; 225.11(b)(3).8. <T3>Income Accruing to the Program (Section 225.9(d))_Suggestion:</T3>The Department received several suggestions on this topic:(1) That the regulations should include more specific instructions on howsponsors are to deduct income accruing to the Program from combined operatingand administrative expenses; and (2) that income from federally-supportedprograms other than the National Youth Sports Program should be exemptedfrom this requirement.<T3>Response:</T3> (1) The Department's intention in the regulations isto provide sponsors with flexibility in making such deductions by not specifyingprecisely how the deduction would be apportioned among operating and administrativecosts; and (2) Income from other federally-supported programs must be deductedonly if it is used in support of the food program. If the Department wereto categorically exempt other federal funds from being deducted from combinedoperating and administrative costs, the federal government would be payingtwice for the same meal.9. <T3>Sponsor Administrative Funds (Section 225.9(d)(7))</T3>_<T3>Suggestion: </T3>Increase the amount of reimbursement to sponsors foradministrative expenses.<T3>Response:</T3> The Department currently has no evidence to suggestthat an increase in administrative reimbursement to sponsors is warranted.10. <T3>Site Records (Section 225.11(c)(4)(ii))_</T3><T3>Suggestion:</T3> Amend this section to allow playground sites to keeptheir records at the sponsor's office, rather than at the playground site.<T3>Response:</T3> The currently regulatory language states only that ``adequaterecords'' must be kept at the site. The Department agrees with this commenterthat, while it is appropriate to expect that some records (e.g., the currentday's meal count and attendance records) will be at the site, other typesof records might be kept in the sponsor's office, depending on such factorsas the availability of secure storage space at the site. We do not believe,however, that these distinctions need to be made explicit in the regulations.It is not realistic to be concerned that State agencies will attempt toterminate sponsors because all of a site's records are not maintained atthat site; this section is intended only to require that records are madeavailable to site reviewers in a reasonable manner.11. <T3>Household Application Procedures (Section 225.12(f)(1))_Suggestion:</T3>Allow enrollment programs to use household applications from the NationalSchool Lunch or School Breakfast Programs as opposed to requiring householdsto fill out a separate SFSP application.<T3>Response:</T3> The Program regulations are derived from the languageof section 13(a)(1)(C) of the National School Lunch Act, which allows anenrollment program to document its eligibility from ``statements of eligibilitybased upon income for children enrolled in the program''. This languagepresumes that the determination of eligibility will be based on a household'scurrent economic circumstances, not on applications completed nine to twelvemonths earlier for one of the School Programs12. <T3>FSMC Procurement Requirements (Section 225.15(g)(5))_Comment: </T3>Thecommenter approved of the ``change'' which requires that competitive procurementprocedures be followed in contracting with food service management companies.<T3>Response:</T3> No change has been made to this section. Section 225.15(g)(5)is a clearer rewording of the former andSection; 225.16(d), but did not changethe substantive intent of the latter section. The old andSection; 225.16(d)also stated that the ``exceptions'' described in that paragraph ``do notrelieve the sponsor of the responsibility to ensure that normally acceptedbidding procedures are followed in contracting with any food service managementcompany.''13. <T3>Age-Adjusted Meal Pattern (Section 225.16(d))_Suggestion:</T3> Adjustthe SFSP meal pattern to allow the service of different quantities of foodto older and younger children.<T3>Response:</T3> Given the less structured nature of food service atopen playground sites compared, for instance, to food service in schoolsor child care settings, the Department has deemed it impractical for sponsorsto try to serve substantially different meals to children of differentages and has established a single meal pattern for the SFSP. This mealpattern matches the age-adjusted meal pattern for children ages 6-12 inthe Child Care Food Program and establishes minimum requirements for mealservice to children participating in the Program. Consistent with andSection;225.16(f)(2), State agencies may authorize sponsors to serve smaller portionsto children under the age of 6 if they are convinced that the sponsor canensure that the variations in portion sizes are appropriate to the agelevels of the children being served. Similarly, if sponsors are capableof serving larger meals to older children, the Department would encouragethem to do so, provided that every child receives a meal which meets orexceeds the meal pattern requirements. Thus, in this sense, it is alreadypossible for sponsors to have an ``age-adjusted meal pattern'' for allchildren.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 225</ITAG>Food assistance programs,

A sponsor shall not receive advance operating costpayments for any month in which it will participate in the Program forless than ten days. (ii) To determine the amount of the advance payment to any sponsor, theState agency shall employ whichever of the following methods will resultin the larger payment: (A) The total operating costs paid to the sponsor for the same calendarmonth in the preceding year; or (B) for vended sponsors, 50 percent of the amount determined by the Stateagency to be needed that month for meals, and, for self-preparation sponsors,65 percent of the amount determined by the State agency to be needed thatmonth for meals.

(ii) Each payment shall equal one-third of the total amount which the Stateagency determines the sponsor will need to administer its program. Forsponsors which will operate for 10 or more days in only one month and,therefore, will qualify for only one advance administrative costs payment,the payment shall be no less than one-half, and no more than two-thirds,of the total amount which the State agency determines the sponsor willneed to administer its program. (3) <T3>Advance payment estimates. </T3>When determining the amount of advancepayments payable to the sponsor, the State agency shall make the best possibleestimate based on the sponsor's request and any other available data. Underno circumstances may the amount of the advance payment for operating oradministrative costs exceed the amount estimated by the State agency tobe needed by the sponsor to meet operating or administrative costs, respectively.(4) <T3>Limit. </T3>The sum of the advance operating and administrative costspayments to a sponsor for any one month shall not exceed $40,000 unlessthe State agency determines that a larger payment is necessary for theeffective operation of the Program and the sponsor demonstrates sufficientadministrative and managerial capability to justify a larger payment. (5) <T3>Deductions from advance payments. </T3>The State agency shall deductfrom either advance operating payments or advance administrative paymentsthe amount of any previous payment which is under dispute or which is partof a demand for recovery under andSection;225.12. (6) <T3>Withholding of advance payments.</T3> If the State agency has reasonto believe that a sponsor will not be able to submit a valid claim forreimbursement covering the month for which advance payments have alreadybeen made, the subsequent month's advance payment shall be withheld untila valid claim is received.

Failure to maintain such records may begrounds for denial of reimbursement for meals served and/or administrativecosts claimed during the period covered by the records in question. Thecosts of meals served to adults performing necessary food service labormay be included in the claim. Under no circumstances may a sponsor claimthe cost of any disallowed meals as operating costs. (5) A final Claim for Reimbursement shall be postmarked and/or submittedto the State agency not later than 60 days after the last day of the monthcovered by the claim.

These foods must be served in a main dish,or in a main dish and one other menu item.(2) Cooked dry beans or peas may be used as a meat alternate or as a vegetable,but they may not be used to meet both component requirements in a meal.(3) Textured vegetable protein products, cheese alternate products, andenriched macaroni with fortified protein may be used to meet part, butnot all, of the meat/meat alternate requirement. The Department will provideguidance to State agencies on the part of the meat/meat alternate requirementwhich these foods may be used to meet. If enriched macaroni with fortifiedprotein is served as a meat alternate it shall not be counted toward thebread requirement.(4) If the sponsor believes that the recommended portion size of any meator meat alternate is too large to be appealing to children, the sponsormay reduce the portion size of that meat or meat alternate and supplementit with another meat or meat alternate to meet the full requirement.(5) Nuts and seeds and their butters listed in program guidance are nutritionallycomparable to meat or other meat alternates based on available nutritionaldata. Acorns, chestnuts, and coconuts shall not be used as meat alternatesdue to their low protein content. Nut and seed meals or flours shall notbe used as a meat alternate except as defined in this section under paragraph(e)(3) and in this Part under Appendix A: Alternate Foods for Meals. Asnoted in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, nuts or seeds may be used tomeet no more than one-half of the meat/meat alternate requirement for lunchor supper. Therefore, nuts or seeds must be combined with another meat/meatalternate to fulfill the requirement. For the supplemental food pattern,nuts or seeds may be used to fulfill all of the meat/meat alternate requirement.(f) <T3>Exceptions to and Variations from the Meal Pattern </T3>(1) <T3>Meals prepared in schools. </T3>The State agency may allow sponsorswhich serve meals prepared in schools participating in the National SchoolLunch or School Breakfast Programs to substitute the meal pattern requirementsof the regulations governing those programs (7 CFR Part 210 and 7 CFR Part220, respectively) for the meal pattern requirements contained in thissection.(2) <T3>Children under 6. </T3>The State agency may authorize the sponsor toserve food in smaller quantities than are indicated in paragraph (d) ofthis section to children under six years of age if the sponsor has thecapability to ensure that variations in portion size are in accordancewith the age levels of the children served. Sponsors wishing to serve childrenunder one year of age shall first receive approval to do so from the Stateagency. In both cases, the sponsor shall follow the age-appropriate mealpattern requirements contained in the Child Care Food Program regulations(7 CFR Part 226).(3) <T3>Statewide substitutions. </T3>In American Samoa, Puerto Rico, Guam,the Virgin Islands, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and theNorthern Mariana Islands, the following variations from the meal requirementsare authorized: a serving of a starchy vegetable_such as ufi, tanniers,yams, plantains, or sweet potatoes_may be substituted for the bread requirements.(4) <T3>Individual substitutions. </T3>Substitutions may be made by sponsorsin food listed in paragraph (d) of this section if individual participatingchildren are unable, because of medical or other special dietary needs,to consume such foods. Such substitutions shall be made only when supportedby a statement from a recognized medical authority which includes recommendedalternate foods. Such statement shall be kept on file by the sponsor.(5)<T3> Special variations. </T3>FNS may approve variations in the food componentsof the meals on an experimental or a continuing basis for any sponsor wherethere is evidence that such variations are nutritionally sound and arenecessary to meet ethnic, religious, economic, or physical needs.(6) <T3>Temporary unavailability of milk. </T3> If emergency conditions preventa sponsor normally having a supply of milk from temporarily obtaining milkdeliveries, the State agency may approve the service of breakfasts, lunchesor suppers without milk during the emergency period.(7) <T3>Continuing unavailability of milk. </T3>The inability of a sponsorto obtain a supply of milk on a continuing basis shall not bar it fromparticipation in the Program. In such cases, the State agency may approveservice of meals without milk, provided that an equivalent amount of canned,whole dry or nonfat dry milk is used in the preparation of the milk componentsset forth in paragraph (d) of this section. In addition, the State agencymay approve the use of nonfat dry milk in meals served to children participatingin activities which make the service of fluid milk impracticable, and inlocations which are unable to obtain fluid milk. Such authorization shallstipulate that nonfat dry milk be reconstituted at normal dilution andunder sanitary conditions consistent with State and local health regulations.(8) <T3>Additional foods. </T3>To improve the nutrition of participating children,additional foods may be served with each meal.<ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart D_General Administrative Provisions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 225.17</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Procurement standards.</ITAG>(a) State agencies and sponsors shall comply with the standards prescribedin the Department's Uniform Federal Assistance Regulations at 7 CFR Part3015, Subpart S, in the procurement of food, supplies, goods, and otherservices with Program payments.(b) The State agency shall make available to sponsors information on 7CFR Part 3015.(c) Sponsors may use their own procurement procedures which reflect applicableState and local laws and regulations, provided that procurements made withProgram funds conform with provisions of this section, as well as withprocurement requirements which may be established by the State agency,with approval of FNS, to prevent fraud, waste, and Program abuse.(d) The State agency shall ensure that all sponsors are aware of the followingpractices specified in 7 CFR Part 3015, with respect to minority businessenterprises:(1) Including qualified minority business enterprises on solicitation lists,(2) Soliciting minority business enterprises whenever they are potentialsources,(3) When economically feasible, dividing total requirements into smallertasks or quantities so as to permit maximum participation by minority businessenterprises,(4) Establishing delivery schedules which will assist minority businessenterprises to meet deadlines, and(5) Using the services and assistance of the Small Business Administration,and the Office of Minority Business Enterprise of the Department of Commerceas required.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;225.18  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Miscellaneous administrative provisions.  </ITAG>(a) <T3>Grant closeout procedures</T3>.

The Child Nutrition (CN) Labeling Program is a voluntary technicalassistance program administered by the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS)in conjunction with the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) and AgriculturalMarketing Service (AMS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), andNational Marine Fisheries Service of the U.S. Department of Commerce (USDC)for the Child Nutrition Programs. This program essentially involves thereview of a manufacturer's recipe or product formulation to determine thecontribution a serving of a commercially prepared product makes towardmeal pattern requirements and a review of the CN label statement to ensureits accuracy. CN labeled products must be produced in accordance with allrequirements set forth in this rule.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Products eligible for CN labels are as follows:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) Commercially prepared food products that contribute significantlyto the meat/meat alternate component of meal pattern requirements of 7CFR 210.10, 225.16, and 226.20 and are served in the main dish.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) Juice drinks and juice drink products that contain a minimum of50 percent full strength juice by volume.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3.

Products that bear a CN label statement as set forth in paragraph3(c) carry a warranty. This means that if a food service authority participatingin the child nutrition programs purchases a CN labeled product and usesit in accordance with the manufacturer's directions, the school or institutionwill not have an audit claim filed against it for the CN labeled productfor noncompliance with the meal pattern requirements of 7 CFR 210.10, 220.8,225.16, and 226.20. If a State or Federal auditor finds that a productthat is CN labeled does not actually meet the meal pattern requirementsclaimed on the label, the auditor will report this finding to FNS. FNSwill prepare a report on the findings and send it to the appropriate divisionsof FSIS and AMS of the USDA, National Marine Fisheries Service of the USDC,Food and Drug Administration, or the Department of Justice for action againstthe company. Any or all of the following courses of action may be taken:(a) The company's CN label may be revoked for a specific period of time;(b) The appropriate agency may pursue a misbranding or mislabeling actionagainst the company producing the product; (c) The company's name willbe circulated to regional FNS offices; and (d) FNS will require the foodservice program involved to notify the State agency of the labeling violation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">7.
