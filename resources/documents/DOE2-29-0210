Prior to theconstruction of Big Bend Unit 4, environmental agencies expressed concernover entrainment of organisms. Engineering and biological studies conductedin 1980 indicated that the application of fine mesh screens (FMS) atthe station would reduce entrainment levels. As a result of this, theenvironmental agencies authorized the use of a once-through condensercooling system in Unit 4 with the installation of FMS (0.5 mm) on bothUnits 3 and 4. In conducting required post-operational (February 1985)studies to verify expected screening efficiencies, TEC identified thatsampling methodologies, and the nature and extent of operational andmaintenance procedures were critical in achieving good screening efficiencies.This paper summarizes TEC efforts in ascertaining adequate screeningefficiencies.</TEXT></DOC>
