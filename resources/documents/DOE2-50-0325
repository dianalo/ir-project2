This strategy is not entirely satisfactorybecause oil sands age after even limited exposure to oxygen. The resultsof a three-year aging study carried out at the Alberta Research Councilare presented in this paper. During aging, the level of water solublesalts in the oil sand increased and hot water processing characteristicsdeteriorated. Through the DLVO and Ionizable Surface Group theories,it is demonstrated that the increase in soluble salts was sufficientto cause the fine solids particles to coagulate in the conditioning stageof the hot water process which results in poorer processibility characteristics.Based on this scenario, relative rates of aging for different gradesof oil sand are estimated.</TEXT></DOC>
