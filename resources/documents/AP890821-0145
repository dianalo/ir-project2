She refused.   It would ruin the neighborhood, Mrs. Kraus explained in her homeabout 200 feet from the building site overlooking one of Frankfurt'sbusiest and noisiest intersections.   Her one-woman campaign against the Campanile, as the skyscraperwould be called, has made the 49-year-old Mrs. Kraus a localcelebrity _ and the bane of developers planning other skyscrapers inFrankfurt, a world financial center.   Mrs. Kraus has the right under Hesse state law to block theCampanile because it would cut her home off from sunlight, and thelaw specifies that every homeowner has a right to sunlight.   The developers have not said how many stories they plan in thebuilding, but it will be 265 meters tall _ or 869 feet, which wouldmake it slightly less than three-quarters the height of the102-story Empire State Building in New York City.   ``The Campanile is just too big for this area,'' Mrs. Kraus said.``Then you have the whole array of problems that crop up, forexample, traffic and burdens on the environment.''   That, she added, isn't worth becoming an instant millionaire.   ``I can't approve of this building by somehow personally takingmyself out of controversy or by being paid off,'' she said in aninterview in her apartment in the six-story building she owns nearthe main railroad station. Developers originally had hoped to startconstruction in March and say she is the sole cause of a costlydelay.   Mrs. Kraus also runs a small pension nearby in her Gutleutviertelneighborhood.   While the ethnically mixed crossroads in the city's center oftenputs German speakers in the minority, Mrs. Kraus says the Campanilewould destroy the ``excellent neighborliness'' in the area.   ``Even my pension guests who are here for a short time noticethat,'' says Mrs. Kraus. ``They go down to the small restaurantsnearby, to the Spaniard, or the Yugoslav or the Greek.''   She says that during the annual summer street festival everyonein the area takes part, ``even the Turkish grandmothers who beforejust looked out of the upper-story windows and didn't dare to comedown.''   Mrs. Kraus takes pride in defending the area where she has livedmost of her life, and she chuckles as she recalls how a former cityplanner predicted money would persuade her to change her mind. Mrs.Kraus is unmarried but it is customary in Germany to refer to womenin her age bracket as Frau, or Mrs. She also holds a doctorate inpolitical science and that requires her foes to address her as``Frau Doktor Kraus'' when they discuss the issue with her.   ``These skyscrapers are a thing of the past,'' she said, becauseof what she called their excessive energy consumption.   Various developers are watching the outcome closely, because theyplan to build a half-dozen or so skyscrapers in Frankfurt.   Critics claim the building boom is excessive in this city ofabout 600,000 people.   Developers say the total price tag for the Campanile project,including the land, runs to nearly $405 million.   Mrs. Kraus faced off with Valentin Weber of the Fay Industrie-undWohnbau KG, representing the developers, on a recent televisionprogram.   ``If we were making a movie,'' said host Guenther Jauch, ``thenyou two would get married in the end, and everything would besettled that way.''   Weber responded that he was already ``happily married'' and Mrs.Kraus observed that, alas, marriages aren't as simple as they usedto be.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Tues PMs Aug. 29</NOTE></DOC>
