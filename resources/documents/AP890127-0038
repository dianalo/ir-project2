FCC Chairman Dennis R. Patrick says it may be time to give ATandamp;T abreak _ sort of _ and perhaps save telephone users billions ofdollars.   But some lawmakers say the FCC doesn't have the legal right tomake such a change.   Nonetheless, the commission will consider the subject Monday in ameeting that is sure to attract legions of attorneys and lobbyistswho've formed battle lines on all sides of the issue.   The FCC, under the deregulation-prone Patrick, has proposed tochange the way the telephone industry leader, American Telephone andTelegraph Co., sets its prices for interstate services.   Since the early 1960s, the government has allowed ATandamp;T a certainprofit beyond its costs. But the FCC in August 1987 suggestedreplacing this ``rate-of-return'' regulation for ``dominantcarriers'' such as ATandamp;T with ceilings on prices. That would includethe seven regional Bell companies that ATandamp;T spun off in 1984.   The commission said the change would encourage greater efficiencyand innovation and save customers $1.6 billion over four years ifall the dominant companies participated.   The FCC last May proposed that ATandamp;T be allowed to raise rates 3percent less than annual inflation.   ATandamp;T applauded the proposal.   ``It's a long overdue step,'' Larry Garfinkel, ATandamp;T vicepresident for marketing services, said in an interview Thursday. Hesaid ATandamp;T has been ``thwarted'' by a cumbersome regulatory processthat has prevented speedy introduction of new services and discountrates.   He said competitors routinely file challenges to any new ATandamp;Tdiscount pricing plan, claiming the plans are designed to undercutcompetition.   ``They never intervene to drive our prices down. They interveneto drive our prices up,'' Garfinkel said.   ``We have (business) customers shaking their heads in disbeliefat what it takes for us to get a simple change in serviceoffering,'' said Joe Nacchio, ATandamp;T vice president for businessservices.   ``If we've got better flexibility to earn we will then be able totake those investments and reinvest,'' Nacchio added.   Members of Congress are skeptical, however. A report lastNovember from the Democratic staff of the House Energy and Commercetelecommunications subcommittee said the FCC proposal fails toassure that rates for regulated phone service will be ``just andreasonable,'' as required by the 1934 Communications Act.   Congress intended, the report said, that rates balance carriers'right for a return on investment and consumers' right to prices inline with the costs of providing service.   ``As currently structured, the price cap scheme will permitcarriers to set prices that may deviate significantly from costs,''the report said. ``There is no assurance that rates would remaineven with a `zone' of reasonableness.''   Last week, in an attempt to allay concerns on Capitol Hill,Patrick sent a six-page letter and 60 pages of supporting documentsto the chairman of the telecommunications subcommittee, Rep. EdwardJ. Markey, D-Mass., and to John D. Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of thefull Energy and Commerce Committee.   He assured Markey and Dingell that the process leading up to theprice cap proposal had been subjected to a rigorous hearing processand that ``the record indicated that it might be possible to replacethe distorted incentives created by rate-of-return regulation withmore efficiency-oriented and consumer-oriented price cap incentivesby making modest changes in existing rules and procedures.''   However, he said he would recommend a number of changes in theprice cap proposal, including a delay in implementing the plan forthe regional Bell companies and other local exchange carriers.   He said he also would recommend establishing separate price cap``baskets'' for ATandamp;T's business and residential customers to preventthe company from raising residential prices to finance ratereductions for businesses.   ``These improvements also will provide residential customersgreater assurances of rate stability _ and a larger share ofpotential ATandamp;T efficiency gains,'' Patrick said.   He also proposed an ``automatic stabilizer'' which he said wouldensure that local carriers' earnings ``remain within the zone ofreasonableness and that consumers share in the efficiency gainsprice cap regulation is designed to generate.''</TEXT></DOC>
