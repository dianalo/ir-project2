The demonstrativeexamination is presented by giving the instances of the combined systemutilizing wind and biomass in Tachikawa, Yamagata Prefecture and thecombined system utilizing geothermal, wind and solar energies in Honjo,Akita Prefecture. In Tachikawa, dung of pig is dried and hardened intopellets. The pellets are burnt in a hotwater boiler for floor-heatingof pigsties. Also the power generated by wind is supplied to the lightingand spaceheating of the pigsties. In Honjo, geothermal water generatedby non-volcanic deep-seated geothermal heat accompanied with the windpower in winter and solar heat in summer in the region examined is usedall the year round for space-heating and domestic hot-water system inan old-age home.
