Since 1980, violent crimes have fallen from 33 per 1,000 U.S.residents to 28, thefts from 83 to 68 per 1,000, and householdcrimes from 227 to 168, the Bureau of Justice Statistics said in areport Sunday.   Crime levels overall rose a statistically insignificant 0.9percent last year from 34.1 million in 1986.   ``Total crime has remained stable during the last three years''and remains at a 14-year low, according to BJS director StephenSchlesinger.   There were 5.5 million violent crimes in 1987, up 0.4 percentfrom the previous year. Thefts totaled 13.45 million last year, up1.7 percent from 1986. Household crimes of burglary, larceny andauto theft totaled 15.4 million, up 0.4 percent from the previousyear. Only motor vehicle thefts grew significantly, by 15 percentto an estimated 1.6 million.   Some criminologists had been predicting continued declines incrime levels for a few more years, based on the fact that the mostcrime-prone age group continues to shrink in size. Thoseresearchers predict an increase in crime in the early 1990s as thechildren of parents born during the post-World War II baby boommove into the 14- to 24-year-old age bracket in significantnumbers. The crime-prone 14- to 24-year-old age group totaled 42.5million in 1986, down nearly 4 million from the 1979 peak.   One factor that could have caused the decline of crime rate inthe early 1980s to stabilize may be increased use of serious drugs,said Alfred Blumstein, dean of the school of urban and publicaffairs at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh.   Illicit drug use among criminal defendants is high and seems tobe on the increase, Justice Department officials said last month ata news conference.   Another possibility, Blumstein said, may be that people now intheir late teen years are disproportionately from a low-incomepopulation, which traditionally has shown more involvement in thecrimes measured by the national survey.</TEXT></DOC>
