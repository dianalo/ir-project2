(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hilltop ruins here may not be thefabled city of gold sought by conquistadors, but voyagers _ most ofthem retirees _ lured by nuggets of history and mystery still occupyGran Quivira.   Gran Quivira, part of Salinas Pueblo Missions National Monument,holds a spiritual treasure for them. The pueblo originally calledCueloze was given its present name in 1780 _ a century after it wasabandoned _ after Indians near El Paso, Texas, told a Spanishchronicler it was Coronado's lost city of gold.   Archaeologists believe up to 10,000 people lived in the area.Scholars aren't sure why they left but National Park Servicepamphlets suggest drought, starvation, Spanish cruelty, disease andApache raids all played a role.   Centuries of wind have eroded the adobe, leaving walls of stackedrocks on the brushy hilltop 60 miles south of Albuquerque.   ``The silence up here: It's not a leaden silence. It's a silencethat speaks to me,'' says Anne Scheeler, a 69-year-old widow fromLakeland, Minn., who completed her first stint as a volunteer thisspring. ``What am I doing in the midst of this wilderness of NewMexico? But listen, you can hear the ghosts of the people who wereliving here.''   Scheeler has edited weekly newspapers, served in the Peace Corpsin Honduras in 1985 and in the Christian Appalachian Project inKentucky in 1987. Now she's in Alaska cooking at a camp forhandicapped children.   Historian Eugene P. Link, 81, and his wife, Beulah, 77, ofPlattsburgh, N.Y., stay here every winter. Link, author of dozens ofarticles, pamphlets and books on social history, worked on galleyrevisions of his fourth book while at Gran Quivira the last twowinters.   ``If you go up almost any time of the day to see the pueblo, it'san extraordinary privilege,'' Mrs. Link said in a telephoneinterview. ``The vistas are just incredible. You're by yourself, andyou can think. You can identify with all the people who have livedthere, what they thought.''   ``There are some people who can't understand why we would everwant to do such a thing,'' Link said. ``A lady came into theVisitors Center. She was from New York City. She came in and threwher arms in the air and said, `Where are the people?'''</TEXT><HEAD>`Grandma, Please' Help Line Offers Company for Kids, Elderly</HEAD><BYLINE>By CLIFF EDWARDS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Estelle Brownstein thought a want ad reading``Grandma Wanted,'' would lead to the perfect job, but she neverexpected to end up as an honorary relative to hundreds through aphone-in service for latchkey children.   Mrs. Brownstein, a 66-year-old grandmother of five, is one of 35``grandmothers by telephone'' to children who come home from schoolto empty houses while one or both parents are at work.   ``The ad ran `We need grandmas'. Well, I'm a grandma, so Ivolunteered,'' she said. ``I found my niche in life. My niche is togive of myself and get something in return.''   ``Grandma, Please,'' lets children aged 6 to 13 call in when theyfeel insecure, need a little advice or just want to talk, saidMonica Glaser, who directs the program at the Uptown Center HullHouse social service agency.   And for some senior citizens, the need to talk is often as greatas that of the latchkey children. Many are confined to their homes,she said.   Being a senior citizen is not enough to qualify. Volunteers mustundergo screening and receive training before being ready for thehelp line.   Seniors must be warm and welcoming on the telephone and verynon-judgmental, Ms. Glaser said. The 33 grandmas _ and two grandpas_ sing to the children on their birthdays, mediate fights and oftenhelp with homework.   ``Oh, they test you,'' Mrs. Brownstein said. ``There are somechildren who want to see if they can get me mad, and I've donepretty good so far.''   Problem cases are directed to the help line's supervisor, apsychologist who reviews the day's work and directs major problemsto appropriate agencies.   The program, the first of its kind, was created in 1985 and hasspread to 30 cities in Maryland, New Jersey and Minnesota, Ms.Glaser said. This year, it has received more than 800 calls, anincrease of 300 over last year. Operators handle 25 to 30 calls aday between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m., transferring calls to a volunteer athome.   The biggest problem the program has had to date is attractinggrandpas, she said. ``The name is `Grandma, Please,' you know. Iwish we could call it something else, but I have to tell them we'rekind of stuck with it.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sept. 7</NOTE></DOC>
