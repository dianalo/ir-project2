The Senate and House of Representatives are expected to givefinal approval this week to legislation granting Mrs. Aquinospecial powers to restore order in the wake of the failed Dec. 1-9coup by thousands of military mutineers.   Although the bill does not give Mrs. Aquino additional powers toclamp down on newspaper and broadcast operations, she toldreporters the government will take action against those spreadingrebel propaganda.   Mrs. Aquino told reporters broadcasters operate under governmentfranchise and that the administration will strictly enforceregulations forbidding ``subversive propaganda.''   ``If they violate these terms and conditions, they will beclosed, their franchises will be taken away from them,'' Mrs.Aquino said. ``With regard to print media, it's an entirelydifferent matter. We will base this on any article that will inciteto rebellion. If such an article does appear in any of thenewspapers, then we will go to court to file charges against theerring individual or the publication.''   There was no indication what criteria the government will use todefine inciting to rebellion or subversive propaganda. Since thelaunch of the coup attempt, the sixth and worst since Mrs. Aquinotook office in February 1986, two radio stations were closed butone was allowed back on the air.   In a front-page editorial Tuesday, the Philippine Daily Inquirercharged that the Aquino government ``appears to be moving towardtighter restrictions on the press.''   Meanwhile Monday, police said the Manila city hall was evacuatedabout 9 a.m. after telephone reports that a bomb had been placedthere. No bomb was found, but the incident disrupted court hearingsand other business there for more than two hours.   Pfc. Edilberto Capacete of the bomb disposal squad said the astring of recent bomb threats appears part of a rebel plan to raisetensions in the capital and undermine confidence in the government.   Last Thursday, suspected mutineers fired two grenades at a U.S.housing and recreational compound, damaging several cars butcausing no injuries. On Dec. 9, a grenade exploded at the city'smain post office, killing two people and injuring 18.   Also Monday, four suspected Communist assassins killed asurburban police chief as he drove to work in suburban Paranaque,police said.   In Quezon province, southeast of the capital, government forcesbattled Communist rebels for about two hours Monday. Fivegovernment troops and two civilians were wounded, the militarysaid. There was no report of military casualties but troopsrecovered 22 rebel firearms, the report said.   More than 20 people, including a town mayor, have been killed bysuspected rebels since the nine-day revolt that began Dec. 1,according to military reports.   On Tuesday, gunmen wounded the commander of a major militarycamp in a daylight ambush and killed a policeman who intervened,the military reported.   It said Lt. Col. Eduardo Amoyo, commander of Camp Bagong Diwa,was hit three times by rifle fire from an auto following his car insuburban Mandaluyong.   Amoyo was reported in stable condition after surgery.
