The Cambridge, Mass., photographic concern said it had requested the court to block Shamrock's offer, to stop Shamrock from buying more Polaroid shares and to make Shamrock sell its Polaroid stock.    As previously reported, Shamrock, an investment vehicle for the Roy E. Disney family, is seeking to take over Polaroid in a $42-a-share, or $2.4 billion, tender offer. The main legal fight between the companies is scheduled to begin this Wednesday in a Delaware state court over Shamrock's offer and anti-takeover measures Polaroid has adopted.    Polaroid said its attorneys are studying the federal court decision but declined to comment further.    Separately, Shamrock, based in Burbank, Calif., said it again extended its $42-a-share offer for Polaroid -- this time until 5 p.m. EDT on Oct. 27.    Shamrock said by the close of business last Thursday, a total of 1,258,023 Polaroid shares had been tendered and not withdrawn. Polaroid has 71 million shares outstanding.    Shamrock's offer originally was set to expire Oct. 7.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, Polaroid closed at $40 a share, up $2.125, amid rumors that Forstmann Little andamp; Co. would make a bid for Polaroid.    Wall Street sources have said that Forstmann previously approached Polaroid about a friendly takeover, but was rebuffed.    Polaroid declined to comment on the latest rumors concerning Forstmann. </TEXT></DOC>
