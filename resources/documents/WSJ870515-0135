The remaining 49% of Super Octanos is owned by Ecofuel, a subsidiary of Italy's state energy company Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi. The credit, which is being arranged by Manufacturers Hanover's London-based investment bank, will help finance a plant for making a gasoline additive that replaces lead as an octane booster.    A spokesman for Manufacturers Hanover in New York declined to comment on the loan.    As previously reported, Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., J.P. Morgan andamp; Co.'s bank unit, has proposed a $100 million loan to Venezuela. This would be partly financed by selling notes to Venezuelan entities allowed to invest in U.S. dollars. That loan proposal still is being negotiated, New York bankers said. A group of West German banks also is negotiating to extend new trade credits to Venezuela, U.S. bankers said.    By trying to restart such lending, large banks also are trying to contain discontent among big debtor countries, such as Venezuela, in the wake of a proposed debt accord with Argentina. That proposed accord granted Argentina better debt restructuring terms than those reached over the past few months with the Philippines, Venezuela and Chile.    Bankers also are trying to honor their earlier pledges. At the end of February, when Venezuela agreed to a proposed $20.34 billion debt restructuring -- which didn't include any new bank loans, bankers told Venezuela it had the necessary characteristics to go back to banks to seek new voluntary loans. Venezuela &quot;has got a proven source of revenue, it has substantial (foreign exchange and gold) reserves and it isn't necessarily overborrowed,&quot; explained a senior U.S. banker.    Venezuela has total foreign debts of about $35 billion, of which $30 billion is bank debt. It has large oil reserves, and the recently strengthened price for oil has substantially improved its current account. </TEXT></DOC>
