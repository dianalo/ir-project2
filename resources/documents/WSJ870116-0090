The agency voted 5-0 to seek public comment on a proposal to let companies own AM radio stations and VHF television stations in the same city. In addition, James McKinney, chief of the mass-media bureau, said the agency also is considering allowing companies to own VHF TV stations and FM radio stations in the same city.    The proposals, which were expected, came as part of a package of actions designed to help ailing AM radio stations. FCC rules currently prohibit companies from owning TV and radio stations in the same city, in an effort to promote diverse opinions and economic competition. But the commission said that eliminating the rules could result in savings for broadcasters, who could invest the money in improved programming.    Eliminating the rules &quot;is part and parcel of intelligent deregulation,&quot; said FCC Chairman Mark Fowler.    American Broadcasting Cos. and National Broadcasting Co. were exempt from these multiple-ownership rules because they both owned TV and radio properties in the same markets before the rules went into effect. However, when New York-based Capital Cities purchased ABC, and Fairfield, Conn.-based GE acquired RCA Corp., the parent of NBC, they were ordered to sell some radio stations.    The decision also could have broad significance for New York-based CBS Inc., should Laurence Tisch, chairman of Loews Corp., and president and chief executive officer of CBS, decide to raise Loews's stake in CBS from the current 24.9%. Analysts have speculated that Mr. Tisch has been deterred from adding to Loews's stake because the FCC could rule that he had gained control of CBS and order CBS to sell some radio and TV stations.    Last year, the FCC ruled that control of CBS hadn't passed to New York-based Loews or Mr. Tisch. The agency is reconsidering its action because of an appeal by Fairness in Media, a conservative political action group.    The FCC has ordered Capital Cities to sell four AM stations and three FM stations in four markets by July. The agency also has ordered NBC to sell two AM and three FM stations in three cities by December. Final action on the rule change isn't expected until late this summer, so the companies may have to ask the agency for an extension of the sales deadline.    The commission said it hasn't yet decided whether to change the multiple-ownership rule for all markets, or only for large ones.    In addition, the agency proposed to let a company own AM and FM radio stations and UHF TV stations in the same market. For the most part, UHF stations -- those that broadcast on channel numbers higher than 13 -- are weaker competitors than VHF stations, and so the commission worries less about those stations dominating a market by buying radio stations. </TEXT></DOC>
