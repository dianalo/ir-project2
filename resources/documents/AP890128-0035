Bush will be in Beijing for two days after the Feb. 24 funeral inTokyo of Japan's Emperor Hirohito.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, in announcing the tripThursday in Washington, said Bush's close ties with China were anelement in the decision to visit Beijing just one month after takingoffice.   ``Undoubtedly there are some personal issues involved there interms of his relations with Deng Xiaoping,'' Fitzwater said, addingthat Bush will show support for Deng's economic reforms.   Bush has known Deng, China's senior leader, since he headed theU.S. Liaison Office in Beijing in 1974-75. Deng at the time was vicepremier but was soon to be purged by leftists in the dying days ofthe disastrous 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.   Deng was firmly in control when Bush, a candidate for vicepresident, returned in 1980, a year after the United States andChina established diplomatic relations. Bush, Deng said, was a ``laopengyou,'' an ``old friend'' of the Chinese people.   But his welcome was less than cordial. The Chinese were outragedby statements by candidate Ronald Reagan that his administrationmight restore official ties with Taiwan, and Bush was delegated toconvince the Chinese that there would be no backsliding inU.S.-Chinese relations.   ``Since we are old friends we must be very frank,'' Deng toldBush. The official Xinhua News Agency later said Bush had ``failedto reassure China over recent statements by Ronald Reagan.''   But the visit also had its warmer moments. Bush and his wife,Barbara, went shopping for teacups at the Friendship Store, thespecial store for foreigners, and walked over to the InternationalClub. There, Bush renewed acquaintances with the barber, the managerand the tennis court attendants he had known in 1974-75.   Bush returned as vice president in May 1982, and toldthen-premier and current Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang, ``Wefeel at home in Beijing. During our stay here we spent a great dealof time on our bicycles touring the city. ... Those were happy days.Those were good days, important days.''   That visit, however, also was dominated by the Taiwan question.Deng spoke of the ``dark clouds'' of bilateral relations caused byU.S. arms sales to Taiwan, and Bush's mission was to defuseBeijing's demand for a final date by which all arms sales to therival Nationalists on Taiwan would cease.   At the beginning of his official talks with Deng, Bush asked fora five-minute private meeting. Instead, the two spent two hourstogether and emerged to tell waiting aides that there was no needfor further discussions.   Three months later the sides signed a communique in whichWashington agreed to gradually reduce arms sales to Taiwan.   Bush's last visit in 1985 was decidedly more relaxed. He spoke tostudents in Sichuan, took a boat ride down the scenic Li River inGuilin and toured the prosperous southern cities of Canton andShenzhen. He also played tennis with then-Vice Premier Wan Li.   ``I like what I see,'' Bush told Deng. ``We still havefundamental differences, systematic differences with China. Butwe're finding more and more things in common.''   Chinese leaders, in a nation where personal ties often outweighideological concerns, unabashedly favored Bush in the presidentialelection and believe that the new administration will have betterunderstanding of and sympathy for China because of Bush's manycontacts here.   Deng, in a meeting with Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci inSeptember, startled U.S. officials by saying he hoped China's ``oldfriend'' Bush would win the election.</TEXT></DOC>
