Faced with steadily eroding congressional support and adrumbeat of complaints by GOP lawmakers that President Bushhasn't personally entered the battle, White House aides havescheduled a pair of White House sessions starting today toplug the administration's defense priorities.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Bush and National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft areexpected to urge bipartisan delegations of congressionalleaders to save the B-2 Stealth bomber, provide robustfunding for mobile nuclear missiles, and keep the Navy's mostadvanced submarine programs alive, administration officialssaid.   Mr. Bush's staff, according to other administrationofficials, also is considering a presidential speech nextweek in Colorado taking on lawmakers intent on slashing suchbig-ticket Pentagon programs, including research onspace-based antimissile defenses called the Strategic DefenseInitiative.   Such efforts, however, are likely to prove largely futilein the House. Even before the House Armed Services Committeebegins voting next week on a $283 billion defense spendingbill for 1991, Rep. William Dickinson of Alabama, the panel'sranking Republican, acknowledged that congressional supporthas eroded badly for the administration's top-prioritydefense requests.   Rep. Dickinson, for example, said in an interview beforethe White House decided on its new course, that he doesn'tintend to fight hard for money the Pentagon wants to deployMX missiles on specially built railroad cars. And he flatlysaid he couldn't understand why the White House continues tochampion the radar-evading B-2, built by Northrop Corp., andSDI.   Even if Congress agrees to continue buying B-2s, the GOPlawmaker asserted, &quot;I don't know what their mission wouldbe.&quot; The Air Force's leadership &quot;loses some credibility whenthey're out there beating the bushes . . . for something thatjust doesn't make sense,&quot; he added.   Discussing the Navy's proposed fleet of high-speed,super-quiet Seawolf attack submarines, which cost about $1.5billion each, Rep. Dickinson said, &quot;I don't know why we'vegot to field a new class of submarines&quot; in light of improvedU.S.-Soviet relations.   The Navy, which has one Seawolf under construction, wantsmoney for two more of the vessels in 1991. But the committeeis almost certain to pare the Navy's request by one, and itmay delay the construction schedule for the other. The Senateversion of the bill doesn't include any money for theSeawolf, slated to be built by units of General DynamicsCorp. and Tenneco Inc.   The House panel also is expected to cut deeply into theNavy's Trident nuclear-missiles submarine program as part ofthe decision by its leadership to slash some $3 billion fromthe administration's $19.1 billion sea power budget requestfor the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.   Meanwhile, the Pentagon's ambitious weapons-buying plansare about to receive another blow from the General AccountingOffice. In testimony before the House Armed Services paneltoday, Comptroller General Charles Bowsher is expected tocriticize Defense Secretary Dick Cheney sharply for failingto go far enough to centralize procurement decisions and trimacquisition and administrative personnel.   To reduce the budget deficit and rein in the Pentagon'sprocurement system, Mr. Bowsher will urge Congress to delayfull-bore production of the next generation of fighters,helicopters and submarines until additional tests arecompleted. And he is expected to call for reductions of 10%to 20% in training, maintenance and other day-to-dayoperating accounts, something the Pentagon strongly opposes.Acting partly on Bowsher's recommendations, the committee isready to eliminate some 65,000 civilian employees from theDefense Department's payroll by the fall of 1991, saving atleast $1 billion annually.</TEXT></DOC>
