The main project under freedom and democracy is thetotal abolition and destruction of communism throughout theworld during 1991. The American people want peace in bothEurope and Asia. In the United States, socialism, atheism,humanism and radicalism are vanishing. Also, there are only afew Communist governments left, such as in Cuba, North Korea,China and several smaller countries.   There is no question but that freedom, democracy andreligion are being restored by substantial majorities. Theterrible days of Stalin, the bloodiest butcher in history,and his terrorism are gone and it is hoped that they willnever return.   Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called thechildren of God, and this applies to all religions. Pope JohnPaul II on Christmas Day prayed for peace and said, &quot;May theworld leaders be convinced that war is an adventure with noreturn.&quot;   Best wishes for a happy and peaceful new year all over theworld.   Hamilton Fish   Cold Spring, N.Y.</TEXT></DOC>
