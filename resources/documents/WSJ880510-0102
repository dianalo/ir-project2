Diplomats, business executives and other trade experts say the drive to remove trade barriers within the European Community by 1992 could become an excuse for creating the biggest and most restrictive trade bloc in the world -- a veritable Fortress Europe, some pessimists say. Trade experts base their fears on several current European attitudes, plus historical evidence about market integration:   --Industry Complaints: European auto makers, financial-services firms and other industries warn they could be left vulnerable to severe U.S. and Japanese competition if national protections are torn away. They want to maintain the existing restrictions on foreign competitors, at least for a transition period.    --National Worries: EC governments are moving slowly to enact more than 300 pieces of national legislation needed to create a single market, fearing adverse repercussions on local industry and labor. They want to make sure that the benefits of the enlarged market don't move outside their domain or cause important local industries to fail.    --Historical Evidence: The Common Agricultural Policy, the EC's most developed set of regulations, is a black hole of protectionism that complicates world trade in several controversial areas. Other trade regulations and a new 2,000-page list of EC tariffs are more evidence that 1992 won't be a panacea for world-trade troubles.    From Australia to Asia and the Americas, trade experts say 1992 offers both opportunity and risk. The opportunity is to create the world's largest single market, with 320 million increasingly wealthy European consumers. But the risk is that &quot;transitory&quot; protectionist measures -- intended to ease the pain of transformation to a united Europe -- will lead to a trade war.    The worries have resulted in a number of recent official visits to Europe. Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, on his first European visit, tried last week to stop an EC protectionist tide. &quot;We are very worried about this new protectionism in Europe,&quot; says a Japanese trade official. The previous week, New Zealand Prime Minister David Lange complained in Brussels, the EC headquarters, about new Common Market restrictions on New Zealand apples and about possible problems related to 1992. &quot;We just want a fair crack at the whip,&quot; Mr. Lange said in a speech.    Common Market officials say they don't want to create a Fortress Europe, and some national governments are resisting local calls for protectionism. The EC Commission, the Common Market's executive body, is frequently cited along with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, as among the most active liberalizers of world trade. But lacking political and legislative power, the commission is often at the mercy of member states, industry and labor.    Economists say protectionism would rob Europe of many of the benefits of market integration, one of which is to create a launching pad to propel European companies into global markets. This is particularly true in the race to develop and sell new technologies and manufactured products, which requires freer trade both in and out of the EC, the economists say.    &quot;If the community uses 1992 as an excuse to close off markets,&quot; says Alfred Kingon, U.S. ambassador to the EC, &quot;it's going to be a gigantic failure. They need this open exchange of ideas with the rest of the world.&quot;    But protectionism is as much part of the European business climate as the three-hour lunch. For example, the European continent's postal services -- which offer everything from stamps and telephones to cable television -- seldom have domestic competition, much less Japanese and American. Europe's auto markets range from being fairly open in West Germany to being nearly impenetrable in Italy, where Japanese car makers are limited to sales of 3,500 units a year. And the Common Agricultural Policy has become a leading obstacle to world agricultural trade.    The important auto sector, which provides work for one in 10 Europeans, tops the list of industries trying to impose limits on outsiders between now and 1992. Jacques Calvet, chairman of the French auto maker Peugeot S.A., calls 1992 a &quot;Trojan horse&quot; that would give an opening to the Japanese, whose imports are restricted by five of the 12 EC countries.    Mr. Calvet, an unofficial spokesman for EC car makers, wants Japanese makers restricted by temporary measures until the Europeans gain equal access to Japan. &quot;I really don't think this stems from a protectionist reflex or a desire to cut Europe's markets off from the rest of the world,&quot; says a Peugeot spokesman. &quot;It's a real desire among European car makers to have equal access to the Japanese market.&quot;    In the financial-services sector, harmonization of banking regulations and licensing procedures could likewise allow Japanese and U.S. banks to go where they've never been before, particularly in the highly regulated southern EC countries. There too, Common Market officials say, third countries will have to offer reciprocal access to EC banks and financial institutions, though they deny that anyone will be worse off.    &quot;If our partners want to take advantage of our integration and profit from the dynamism it will create,&quot; says Willy De Clercq, the EC's external trade commissioner, &quot;they will have to . . . open their own markets on equivalent terms.&quot;    U.S. officials fear that such reciprocal measures will be used to push foreigners back from markets where they already hold a good position. One Washington trade official contends that the EC previously has tried to pass along costs of integration to its trading partners. When Spain and Portugal joined the EC in 1986, the EC applied a 100% tariff on U.S. corn imports that would have cost U.S. farmers $400 million a year. Negotiations reduced the impact but left U.S. officials skeptical about the potential benefits of 1992.    &quot;In the U.S., we think it's a good idea to have a more united Europe,&quot; notes the official. &quot;But on the other hand, we don't want to be the ones to pay for it.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
