Mitchell, in a speech to a United Auto Workers conference,rattled off a list of Bush campaign proposals on issues, includingthe environment, education and child care, and said he would belistening closely when the president addresses a joint session.   ``We look forward to his proposals, beginning (Thursday) night,as to how we should give meaning to those words,'' the MaineDemocrat said. ``These policies, like all others, must begin withwords. But they cannot end with words.   ``There must be deeds to match words, action to fulfillintention,'' Mitchell continued. ``We're going to hold the presidentaccountable to his words and we want to work with him. ... Workingtogether we can do much.''   Mitchell also promised passage of legislation to increase theminimum wage, one of his top legislative priorities as well aslabor's.   ``If I don't do anything else as majority leader of the UnitedStates Senate, I'm going to see that the minimum wage is increasedthis year as it should be,'' he said to a standing ovation.   The minimum wage, which has been $3.35 an hour since 1981, wouldincrease 40 cents an hour to $4.55 at the end of three years underSenate legislation supported by Mitchell. After that, thelegislation calls for the minimum wage to be indexed annually to 50percent of the average hourly income of U.S. workers.   Mitchell delivered a lengthy defense of the Democratic Party,traditionally backed by organized labor, and said Bush's call for a``kinder, gentler'' America included ideas ``for which we haveworked as Democrats for a half century.''   But, in an unusual statement nonetheless met with applause,Mitchell said many of those those who have benefitted fromDemocrat-sponsored programs, including union members, have abandonedthe party.   ``There's a lot of analysis about why Democratic candidates havelost five out of (the last) six presidential elections,'' Mitchellsaid. ``And as a member of the Democratic leadership I say we in theparty share a major portion of the responsibility. But I also say toyou that there are a lot, too many, of your members who haveforgotten where they came from, who because of Democrats began tolive like Republicans and then started voting that way.''</TEXT></DOC>
