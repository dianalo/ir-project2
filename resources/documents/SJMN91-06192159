Brown, executive director of the Electric VehicleAssociation, a group of auto and battery makers. But sodium sulfur batterieshave been around for decades, and nobody has succeeded in commercializingthem.;    Today's lead-acid batteries limit most electric vehicles to about 60miles for an 8-hour charge, although some models do better. Most batteries forelectric vehicles are expensive because they are made by hand, at an averagecost of about $20,000, Brown said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910710  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  260  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday July 10, 199100192159,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
