Ambassador Mya Thein confirmed the sale but said he did not knowhow much land was sold or the amount of money it brought.   He said the matter was in the final stages of negotiations.   The national newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun said Saturday that arealtor already had paid the money and received a deed for 100,070square feet of land.   The paper said the embassy would retain present buildings foroffices and embassy housing and that the purchaser, the M.C.G.construction company, planned to construct a business-residencecomplex on the purchased land.   Company officials could not be reached for comment Sunday.   Major donor nations cut off new aid to Burma after the militarygovernment of Gen. Saw Maung seized power in September 1988 andviolently suppressed a pro-democracy uprising. The isolationistpolicies of former strongman Gen. Ne Win already had impoverishedthe country, once one of Southeast Asia's richest.   In the year following the 1988 coup, the price of rice, theBurmese staple, more than doubled and prices of other basiccommodities also rose rapidly.   The new government has sought to boost the economy by reversingNe Win's closed-door policies and seeking foreign investment.   While the United States and Western Europe have shunned Burmapolitically, Coca-Cola has become the first American company since1962 to sign an agreement to sell there, and American oil companiesare discussing exploration contracts.   Businessmen from Japan, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia and SouthKorea have negotiated deals in such areas as fishing, mining,timber and tourism.</TEXT></DOC>
