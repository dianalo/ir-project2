A laboratoryincubation study was therefore conducted using {sup 15}N to trace thedynamics of fertilizer {sup 15}NH{sub 4}{sup +} added to samples of onetopsoil and five coal mine spoils from Colorado and Wyoming. Carbon dioxideevolution, N mineralization, nitrification, microbial immobilization,and NH{sub 4}{sup +} fixation within clay minerals were monitored overtime. The organic matter in three of the spoils was considerably lesssusceptible to microbial decomposition than the topsoil organic matter,whereas the organic matter in the fourth spoil was slightly less susceptiblethan, and in the fifth spoil comparable to, topsoil organic matter insusceptibility to microbial decomposition. However, the amount of plant-availableN mineralized was at least five times higher in the topsoil than in anyof the spoil materials. The data suggest that, under field conditions,none of the spoil materials evaluated in this study will likely be ableto adequately supply the N requirements of a reseeded plant community.The significantly more active microbial population of the topsoil immobilizedmore of the added {sup 15}NH{sub 4}{sup +} than in any of the spoilsexcept the shale, whereas more of the added {sup 15}NH{sub 4}{sup +}was nitrified and remained as NO{sub 3}{sup -} in the spoils than inthe topsoil. The data indicate that under field conditions, a largerproportion of added fertilizer NH{sub 4}{sup +} will be susceptible toloss via NO{sub 3}{sup -} leaching or volatilization in the spoils thanin the topsoil. 44 refs., 3 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
