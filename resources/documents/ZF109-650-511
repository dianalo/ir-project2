 The test network includes several servers and 15 assortedclient microcomputers.andP;  LAN cabling is divided into one cable thatlinks all load stations to an adapter in the server and anothercable attached to a separate microcomputer used to measureperformance.andP;

 The data collected and theexperimentation done during a race feeds back into the design of more-commonhighway iron.andP;  Similarly, we learned a lot from testing NetWare 386 and LANManager that you can use to benefit your organization's network.andM;Here are some of our top-line conclusions: After you make sure that yourserver has a fast hard disk and enough memory for disk caching, put two ormore network adapter boards in the server and split the network cabling toeven the average load.andP;  This simple operation will give you an impressivepayoff in throughput.andP;  Another conclusion: Encouraging end users to use localprinters rather than network-connected printers will speed up throughput foreveryone.andM;Our experimentation proved that servers made from combinations of burlyhardware and specialized software have lots of throughput left even afterthey fill an Ethernet cable to 70 or 80 percent of capacity.andP;  You need moreLAN capacity than a single Ethernet link can provide to tax the server'scapabilities.andM;THE TESTSandM;To keep our test results consistent with past issues, we ran our usual HardDisk Access Load test from the standard suite of PC LAN Labs benchmark tests.andO;This test is still evolving, however, and we are now in the beta cycle of anew test version that will produce even more rigorous operation.andP;  (For adescription of Network Throughput Under Load test results, see PC Magazine,September 25, 1990, page 35.)andM;We added a new task to the benchmark test activity in order to more closelysimulate the use of a server in a modern organization and to load the servermore heavily.andP;  This task involved placing a 1MB print job into the server'sprinter spool.andP;  We then ran our tests as the server fed the print job to aHewlett-Packard LaserJet attached to the parallel port.andP;  This print job tookbetween 5 and 7 minutes to move to the printer, so we had sufficient time torun the throughput tests simultaneously.andM;THE LOAD DATAandM;In addition to our servers, we used an assortment of 15 PCs as clientstations, as well as a sixteenth machine that we used for testingperformance.andP;  The 15 load machines generated the flurry of activity shown inthe box labeled Load Data.andP;  This chart shows the number of bytes movedthrough the network cable by the 15 load machines during 1 minute while theserver also fed an attached printer a large print job.andP;  Our Network GeneralSniffer collected this data over a run of several minutes and then averagedthe results.andM;We present this Load Data box primarily to illustrate the amount of work doneby the load stations.andP;  These load stations kept the Ethernet system runningat 70 to 80 percent of maximum capacity--something seldom if ever found evenin installations with hundreds of nodes.andP;  The main benchmark test charts showthe throughput achieved by a separate station running a different set ofdata-handling tasks while these stations load the network.andM;SPLITTING THE CABLEandM;We divided our LAN cabling by putting all the load stations on one cable andone adapter in the server.andP;  Next we took the PC that we used to measureperformance and placed it on its own Ethernet cable, which was connecteddirectly to a dedicated adapter in the server.andP;  This arrangement eliminatedcontention on the Ethernet segment used by the performance-measurement PC andmoved the contention into the server's data bus and disk cache subsystem.andO;The improvement in throughput experienced by the station on the separatecable was substantial.andM;The throughput tests for 5, 10, and 15 stations with no print job were alldeveloped using two adapters in each server.andP;  For illustration, we alsoincluded a throughput test with a load of 15 stations plus theperformance-measurement PC on the same cable and server network adapter.andP;  Theslower numbers for this test reflect not degradation in the server but theincreased difficulty that the performance-measurement PC had in getting tothe host through the busy cable and adapter.andM;We also tested the same 15-station load on the single cable and adapter underthe added simultaneous load of the print job moving from the server to theprinter.andP;  Here we found that throughput dropped considerably-anywhere from 13to 65 percent, not including the NCR server running NetWare 386, whichrefused to function on this test.andP;  The final column shows the same load onthe server, but with the performance-measurement PC connected to the serverthrough its own cable and adapter.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
