<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-70-0725 </DOCNO><TEXT>The intent of this on-site safety review was to make a broad managementassessment of HFBR operations, rather than conduct a detailed in-depthaudit. The result of the review should only be considered as having identifiedtrends or indications. The Team's observations and recommendations forthe most part are based upon licensed reactor facility practices usedto meet industry standards. These standards form the basis for many ofthe comments in this report. The Team believes that a uniform minimumstandard of performance should be achieved in the operation of DOE reactors.In order to assure that this is accomplished, clear standards are necessary.Consistent with the past AEC and ERDA policy, the team has used the standardsof the commercial nuclear power industry. It is recognized that thisapproach is conservative in that the HFBR reactor has a significantlygreater degree of inherent safety (low pressure, temperature, power,etc.) than a licensed reactor.</TEXT></DOC>
