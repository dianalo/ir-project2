The fuel return conduit and support is in the formof a hollow metallic tube with a substantially helical configuration,an upper end of the tube being attached to the support member and thelower end portion of the tube terminating near the tank bottom and beingoperably attached to the reservoir means and fuel pump. The helical tubehas axially spaced coils between its end portions for allowing a variancein the axial length of the combination fuel return and support. The axiallength of the helical configuration is selected in relation to the dimensionsof the fuel tank to produce a decreased axial length of the helical configurationwhen the assembly is installed in the fuel tank and the support coveris attached to the fuel tank so that the reservoir is forced againstthe fuel tank bottom wall by the yieldable shortening in axial lengthof the helical configuration.</TEXT></DOC>
