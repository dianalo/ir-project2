The Iraqi ground attack aimed at regaining the Faw Peninsula atthe gulf's northern end coincided with the heaviest fightingbetween the United States and Iran in the gulf.   During Monday's series of clashes in the southern part of thegulf, Iran broadcast a claim that U.S. helicopters were helpingIraqi troops. The Pentagon dened any U.S. involvement in the groundfighting.   The United States attacked two Iranian oil platforms toretaliate for damage caused to a U.S. frigate by an Iranian mine.Iranian ships then took on superior U.S. forces in a series ofengagements over several hours.   The Americans disabled two Iranian frigates and sunk or damagedfour gunboats. One American helicopter was missing and Iran said itshot the aircraft down. Iran also claimed it sank a U.S. ship.   During the fighting, U.S. Navy officers in the gulf alsoreported Iran launched at least five Chinese-made Silkwormmissiles. The Pentagon said it could not confirm what kind ofmissiles were fired and Adm. William Crowe, chairman of the JointChiefs of Staff, said there was no evidence Iran had firedSilkworms.   Whether they were Silkworms or not, it was the first time Iranhad launched missiles at U.S. warships since the Navy increased itspresence in the Persian Gulf in July. The use of missiles and theactions of Iranian patrol boats showed that Tehran was prepared toseriously tangle with the Americans despite the U.S. Navy'ssuperior firepower.   Western analysts believe the Iranians, apparently being pushedoff the Faw Peninsula by Iraq, needed to claim that they were underattack by the United States as well as by the Iraqis.   ``Unless the Iranians can pull a rabbit out of the hat, theywould seem to be in trouble,'' said Hans-Heino Kopietz, a MiddleEast military analyst with the London-based International Institutefor Strategic Affairs.   ``The developments of the last couple of days have thrown thewhole gulf war wide open.'' he said in an interview. ``It lookslike the Iranians have been dislodged by the Iraqis.''   The Iraqi offensive in Faw, captured by Iranian RevolutionaryGuards in February 1986, was a major surprise.   The Iraqis' strategy has been one of static defense since 1982,when they were driven out of Iran after invading in September 1980.If Iraq has recaptured the peninsula, it will be a rare victory forBaghdad and a psychological setback for Tehran.   In those circumstances, Iran chose to take on the Americans.   Since July, despite the occasional clash and bellicose rhetoric,the Iranians have gone out of their way to avoid a seriousengagement with the U.S. fleet, with its missile destroyers andaircraft carriers that outgun anything the Iranians have.   The United States keeps between 25 and 30 ships in the gulfregion, including destroyers, cruisers, frigates and mine sweepers.Jet aircraft from the carrier Enterprise also attacked Iranianships in Monday's fighting.   Iran can muster four small frigates, two of which were hitMonday. In addition, Iran has some vessels used as gunboats, somepatrol boats and is believed to have at least 50 speedboats,40-foot Swedish-built Boghammers.   Paul Beaver, naval editor of Jane's Defence Weekly, said thespeedboats are basically recreational craft with large engines thatIranian Revolutionary Guards have used to attack tankers withrocket-propelled grenades. Beaver said they also may be equippedwith machineguns or mortars.   According to Jane's, Iran has eight F-14 Tomcat fighters, 20 F-4Phantom figher-bombers and as many as 40 F-5 Tigers, all U.S. built.   Iran also has Silkworm missiles as well as the mines that havedamaged merchant shipping and last week blew a hole in the U.S.frigate Samuel B. Roberts, injuring 10 crewmen.   The Iraqis, who have long sought to internationalize the gulfconflict to pressure Iran to negotiate, apparently launched the Fawoffensive in response to Iranian thrusts in the northern part ofthe battlefront.   The Iranians overran a large chunk of northeast Iraq last month.   The 1986 seizure of Faw has long stuck in the Iraqis' throat.But, despite repeated counterattacks, they had been unable to oustthe Iranians.   The Iranians, have not admitted they have lost the Faw Peninsulabut their allegations that the Americans helped the Iraqisindicates they have at least lost ground in Faw.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Ed Blanche is the AP's Middle East News Editor.He has covered Iranian affairs since 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
