It has restructured andrefinanced, sold off divisions, closed distribution centers and departments,and some analysts think it may yet shut down its catalog operations.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  POOR SERVICE SEEN AS KEY TO SEARS' WOES  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Staff has been cut periodically, and Sears is now laying off another 21,000-- supposedly in non-selling store positions. Salespeople are already scarce.;   Retail analysts talk of new competition, management rigidity andmerchandising mix in explaining why the big retailer &quot;lost its franchise&quot; withconsumers. One could also ask consumers: many who used to shop at Searsregularly don't any more, and they don't mention management and merchandisemix. They talk of service.;    &quot;It's like a store in Russia,&quot; says one SantaMonica shopper. &quot;The people are unhelpful, the stock's not there, and you haveto wait in line forever to pay.&quot;;    Significantly, everyone has a Searsstory, a classic tale of retail insult. In Los Angeles, Roslyn Blackmanbrought back her son's new tool chest because the inside had apparently beenbadly damaged and just re-taped, and had to fight the salesman, &quot;who keptsaying, 'How do we know it was damaged at the store?' &quot;;    Public relationsconsultant Nat Read, a former Sears executive, bought a washer and dryer, freedelivery included. The washer was the wrong model, and had to be sent back,and he was charged for the second delivery on the grounds that only onedelivery is free.;    Some of Sears' problems came from outside. Searstraditionally offered one-stop shopping -- everything from socks torefrigerators, good quality, good prices. But today's malls made one-store,one-stop shopping unnecessary. And today's discounters and big specialtystores (for appliances, electronics, toys, hardware, even fashion) leave Searsbehind on both price and selection.;    Along with cutting costs to matchslipping sales, Sears &quot;has been struggling,&quot; says Leonard Berry, director ofTexas Aandamp;M's Center for Retailing Studies, &quot;to find a strategy to regain themomentum it had 20 years ago.&quot; But real change comes hard to a massiveorganization with over $30 billion in sales and more than 850 storesnationwide. It may lose some bulk, but it's still a dinosaur, its brain so farfrom its moving parts that it's slow to react or shift direction.;    Therehas nevertheless been a virtual flurry of activity in the retail store. Searskept tinkering with the &quot;merchandise mix,&quot; moving into fashion with a CherylTiegs line, carrying fewer private labels and more national names. Itestablished &quot;power formats&quot; -- stores within the store, specializing inelectronics and appliances (Brand Central), children's clothing (Kids andMore).;    It tinkered with pricing, announcing that &quot;everyday low pricing&quot;would replace its emphasis on sales and specials. The public misunderstoodthis (said Sears), assuming prices would move downward.;    In fact (said NewYork's attorney-general, among others), many prices moved up -- to somewherebetween the &quot;sale&quot; price at which they regularly sold and the &quot;regular&quot; priceat which they almost never sold. Stable prices (said Sears) would also freesalespeople to serve customers, instead of constantly changing price tags.;   But such statements were not followed by any announced programs to improveservice -- perhaps the only merchandising trick Sears hasn't tried. Not one ofa dozen consumers queried liked the service.;    It's partly a matter ofnumbers. A Colorado woman calls Sears &quot;low on clerks.&quot; Says Judy Marriner inMassachusetts, who visits Sears now only for batteries and tires, &quot;You don'tget any service. They just have cashiers now.&quot;;    It's also a matter ofattitude. A recent visitor to the Santa Monica Sears (which seeks comments onits service via &quot;we care&quot; forms placed around the store) found that mostdepartments had no salespeople, the salespeople present didn't leave theircounters, and three in four were neither knowledgeable nor communicative. Oneeven refused to sell two flashlights for the $3.88 they were marked, becausethe cash register showed the price as $3.99. He told the customer to go checkthe price on the shelf, then gave up the sale rather than the 22 cents.;    Hewas wrong, said his supervisor later. &quot;Next time, you ask for the manager.&quot;;   Baloney, says Read, who &quot;had to go to the store manager on each of my lastthree purchases. The system is supposed to work so you can buy somethingwithout going through the store manager.&quot;;    Such complaints about Searsservice may actually say more about its troubles than anything else. It's easyto change goods and prices, but hard to change the nature of the beast,particularly such a big one. Size alone may keep it around a while yet, butonce the climate changes, perhaps no strategy can halt its decline.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  S.J.
