(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Laura BrennanandM;The Persian Gulf crisis, a weakening economy and the savings and loan debaclehave not damaged the balance sheets of data-processing companies--yet,according to a Gartner Group Inc. report.andM;A recent edition of the report, called Yardstick Quickflash, notes thatpurchase plans put in place before the rise of current crises helped thedata-processing sector of the information industry achieve its highestearnings growth rate in three years.andM;The combined revenue growth of the 109 data-processing companies reportingthird-quarter results increased slightly to 7.9 percent, while net incomerose a whopping 40.6 percent, said Randall Brophy, the senior researchanalyst who compiled the report for the Gartner Group, based in Stamford,Conn.andM;IBM and Unisys Corp. contributed significantly to the data-processingsector's impressive earnings.andP;  IBM reported data-processing earnings of $1.1billion in the third quarter -- a 26.8 percent increase over the same periodin 1989.andP;  Unisys managed to trim its losses to $357 million, compared with aloss of $648 million in the third quarter last year.andP;  Not counting those twofirms, the data-processing sector's earnings grew 2.3 percent, Brophy said.andM;In addition to data processing, Yardstick QuickFlash also breaks outtelecommunications and electronic components as sectors in the overallinformation industry.andP;  Both industries increased their revenues since thethird quarter of last year, further substantiating a pre-crisis buying trend,Brophy said.andM;In the telecommunications sector, ATandamp;T posted a revenue increase of 5.3percent, largely due to equipment sales and a 7 percent increase in callingvolume.andP;  U.S.andP;  Sprint Communications Co. grew 15.2 percent, while MCICommunications Corp. logged an increase of 3.6 percent.andP;  Total sector revenuegrew 5.3 percent since last year.andM;Companies in the electronic-components sector managed to bounce back from a 1percent growth rate in last year's third quarter to a combined 9.1 percentgrowth rate this year, Brophy said.andP;  Intel Corp. enjoyed a 31.2 percentgrowth rate due to strong demand for its 386SX processor.andP;  Motorola Inc.'ssales increased 14 percent on strong demand in Japan, while medium-sizedfirms such as Varian Associates Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. showedmodest declines.andM;Although the most recent Yardstick QuickFlash appears to give a clean bill ofhealth to the information industry, the results of recessionary spendingshould show up in the next two waves of quarterly results, Brophy said.andM;The microcomputer market, in fact, has already slowed to its lowest growthrate since the fourth quarter of 1986, Brophy said.andP;  That segment achieved a7.1 growth rate in the third quarter, down from 15 percent in the secondquarter of this year.andM;The information industry growth rate in QuickFlash is derived by aggregatingthe revenue of more than 140 companies into the various sectors, Brophy said.andO;Yardstick Quarterly, a more comprehensive analysis published 60 days afterthe quarter closes, includes the results of 80 additional companies.andO;Yardstick Quarterly separates the sectors into 10 segments and providesgrowth rates for each company noted.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
