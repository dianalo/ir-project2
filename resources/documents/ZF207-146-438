Bernardsville, NJ 07924(201) 953-0322andM;List Price: $150andM;Requires: 7K RAM, DOS 2.1 or later.andM;In Short: Virusafe takes reasonable action against viruses, but most of thetime the user has no notification of an event occurring, making the programless than useful in many situations.andP;  In this field of competitors, the $150price is too high.andP;  Not copy protected.andM;Virusafe from comnetco ($150) consists of three major parts, two of which arepassive in nature: the virus diagnostics program and the program integritychecker.andP;  The third is run as a TSR (memory-resident program).andP;  All programscan be run whenever the user chooses, but the best method is to run theVirusafe protection commands at boot-up from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.andM;The virus diagnostics program (VC.EXE) is executable from the command line orfrom a .BAT file or another program.andP;  Its purpose is to take a snapshot ofyour system's memory and scan it for a virus.andP;  This is a useful program tohave as your last AUTOEXEC.BAT line during system boot-up.andP;  It allows you tocheck your PC's memory after you've loaded any special programs or TSRs thatyou normally load at boot-up and to detect if any have been replaced byviruses.andP;  Of course, you work under the assumption that VC itself has notbeen toyed with, but if you can live with keeping a backup copy of Virusafeand having it handy every time you reboot, it could be worth your while.andO;Remeber that the floppy disk must be kept secure as well.andM;The next piece of Virusafe is PIC, the program integrity check.andP;  This niftylittle program is very easy to use and allows you to flag individual filesfor viruses whenever you use the command PIC /N.andP;  For instance, you may wantto have specific files like COMMAND.COM checked for violations.andP;  PIC willrecord various aspects of the flagged files, such as size, as well as its ownchecksums.andM;VS.EXE, the memory-resident portion of Virusafe, is responsible for detectingviruses and preventing them from infecting your system in real time (as theyhappen).andP;  Unfortunately, Virusafe is so diligent in its prevention that itstops just about everything.andM;There are two problems here.andP;  First, even though Virusafe is supposed toprevent a virus attack, it almost never alerts the user.andP;  This doesn't seemright; viruses should be prevented, but they should also be announced.andP;  Forinstance, in our testing we were only able to make VS.EXE detect that someother program was launching a TSR of its own.andP;  This is an important concern,but why stop there?andM;The second problem is that the documentation for Virusafe fails to point outthat programs that need to act in special ways may not function correctlywith Virusafe loaded.andP;  This can present a serious drawback.andM;The result is that Virusafe's memory-resident capabilities are limited,especially when compared to some of the other anti-virus programs on themarket.andP;  With products from other vendors, you are typically confronted withpop-up windows informing you of a potential problem or illegal access to afile or an area of the disk.andP;  In addition, you are usually given two choices:to allow the problem or access to occur, thereby letting the program continueon its way, or to abort or prohibit the suspicious activity so that illegalaccess is denied and the spreading of the virus can be halted.andP;  It would benice if Virusafe gave you this option.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
