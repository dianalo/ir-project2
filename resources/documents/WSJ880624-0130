But if the two leading members of OPEC adopt such harsh measures, they probably won't do so for months -- perhaps not until early next year, according to petroleum stategists in the Persian Gulf states.    Saudi Arabia will watch developments &quot;for at least two months -- possibly longer,&quot; before attempting to go beyond its OPEC production quota of 4.3 million barrels a day, said an individual close to the kingdom's petroleum planning. But he said that if quota-cheating remains widespread in OPEC, Saudi Arabia will produce its &quot;proportionate share&quot; of the excess output.    So far in June, OPEC production has been averaging 18.5 million barrels a day, according to Petro-Logistics Ltd., a Geneva consulting firm, which tracks the cartel's oil output. Excluding the 2.6 million barrels a day produced by Iraq, which isn't a party to the current quota agreement, total output of the 12 other OPEC nations exceeds their ceiling of 15.1 million barrels a day by some 800,000 barrels. Production in the United Arab Emirates, which frequently exceeds its quota, has come down some recently but still remains above its allotment.    It was a lack of production discipline in 1985 that led Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest producer, to begin a market-share battle that triggered the oil-price crash of 1986. Since then, however, the Saudis have been very careful to avoid any action that could be misinterpreted as another scramble for market share. They have kept their own output within their quota, and have repeatedly admonished others in OPEC to maintain production discipline.    Recently, however, the Saudis have made clear that they are losing patience with some of OPEC's quota violaters. At last week's OPEC meeting in Vienna, there were strong signals that the Saudis would consider increasing their output as a countermove.    Kuwait also suggested at last week's meeting that it eventually might exceed its quota of one million barrels a day by 30% if another production issue -- the definition of &quot;condensates,&quot; or light petroleum liquids currently excluded from OPEC quotas -- isn't resolved. Kuwait had raised that issue earlier by accusing Venezuela of calling certain crudes condensates so that they would be excluded from the Venezuelan quota.    The Venezuelans have countered with evidence that suggests their definition of condensates is widely accepted by the world's petroleum engineers. Kuwait claims that by using the same definition, nearly a third of the crude oil produced under its quota could be reclassified as condensates.    The issue is under study by a committee of technical experts from the OPEC countries and will be reconsidered at the winter meeting of the oil ministers. If it isn't resolved, or if the Venezuelan definition is accepted by OPEC, Sheik Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti oil minister, said he plans to reclassify 300,000 barrels a day of Kuwait's crude oil as condensates.    These condensates then would be produced outside Kuwait's quota, increasing its output 300,000 barrels a day. But the Kuwaiti minister said the increased production wouldn't begin before Jan. 1. </TEXT></DOC>
