Teikoku Data Bank Ltd. said the volume of debts leftbehind by bankrupt companies in January skyrocketed 1,004% to642.34 billion yen ($4.96 billion), the second-highest levelin history. January was the fourth consecutive month in whichbankruptcies rose from year-earlier levels. Until October,the number of insolvencies had fallen on a year-to-year basisfor 69 months.   Teikoku Data Bank noted that the bankruptcies of realestate companies Nanatomi K.K. and Aoyama BuildingDevelopment K.K. were partly responsible for the huge amountof January liabilities.   The number of insolvencies in the real estate sector morethan tripled in January from a year earlier to 49 cases. Theamount of liabilities in the single month jumped to 472.68billion yen, more than the total value of real estatebankruptcies for all of 1990.                                                                                                          BRAZIL LOWERS IMPORT TARIFFS                                                                                                          Brazil is lowering tariffs on hundreds of imported goods,ranging from cars to food, effective today. The new tariffsare part of a long-ranging reform of industrial and tradepolicy begun last June. Until last year, Brazil chargedduties of as much as 105% on imports. A government officialsaid tariffs will continue to drop until January 1994, whenthey will range from zero to 40%.                                                                                                          POWER SHORTAGE ALTERS PLANS                                                                                                          At least 25 foreign and domestic investors have delayed orcanceled plans to establish industrial projects in Indonesiabecause of a shortage of power. Foreign investors who havealtered their plans come from Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.The state electricity company has said it would be able tomeet only a small portion of the electricity needs of newfirms.
