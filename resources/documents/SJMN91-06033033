They were also buying chairs that retail for less than $100.(hbox) &quot;The opulence and extravagance of the Reagan years has slowed down,&quot;said Neville Nowell, owner of a showroom in the Sobel Building where $1,400chairs can easily be had. &quot;People are reanalyzing their lives and consideringwhat life will be like in the 21st century. People will definitely be spendingmore time at home -- they already are -- so there will be increasing focus onthat part of their lives.&quot; (hbox) For the 21st century, Nowell predicted thatquality would be the keyword. &quot;People who have never seemed to care aboutquality now seem to. And, although this is a rather un-American idea,&quot; saidNowell, who grew up in England, &quot;people are starting to abandon the idea ofgoing out to buy all their furnishings at once. Instead, they'll add to theircollection as they go along. That's the way it should be, I think.&quot; (hbox)Recycling is a new furnishings word for the '90s. &quot;Colors change very quicklythese days because of communications, politics, society and economics, but weare going to start recycling some of them now. You might call it colorecology. Color is becoming less disposable,&quot; predicted Barbara Colby, a memberof the Color Marketing Association of America, who gave a color seminar duringthe market atShowplace Square. &quot;The '90s will be the Decency Decade.&quot;;    Theeconomic downturn, she explained, creates a swing back to the basics --neutral colors. &quot;It simply costs more to produce saturated colors,&quot; she said.Her predictions for the next two years show a warming trend because yellow --introduced by recent art exhibitions -- is warming up the palette in general.Other influences she said include gardening, men's increasing interest incolor, new ethnic elements in U.S. society, and ecology.;    &quot;Technology willalso be a major influence. More than 90 percent of the products we'll use inthe future haven't yet been invented,&quot; Colby said. &quot;Our traditional homes willbe affected by the technology, but they will also be a refuge from it. A trendtoward using more fabrics with high textures will help soften ourenvironments.&quot;;    Available to do just that were a plethora of new fabricsshown in the Showplace Square area and the Western Merchandise Mart. Amongthem were sensual Boussac of France cut velvets in dense, complex colors ontranslucent backgrounds. Hiromi, a dramatic, quasi-Japanese, oversize wavepattern made of polyester and rayon, was shown in a variety of colorcombinations including kelly green and navy blue, and burnt sienna and olivegreen.;    Jack Lenor Larsen introduced an elegant double weave calledHologram Leaves. The iridescent, subtle fabric is created in silk and linen.Stroheim and Romann introduced a surreal pattern of Greek scenes in varyingshades of brown and black called Corinth.;    Iron and steel in lamps andfurniture was another strong theme. For examples, Sloan/Miyasato's amazinglysinewy French daybed had a rusted steel finish, and an evocativeancient-looking cast bronze table was done by artist Cevin Forrist.Wrought-iron furniture abounded in mostly traditional designs made in Mexicoand Los Angeles. Metals, Colby said, will continue to be important ininteriors as people lean toward the traditional styles, because metals have a&quot;timeless quality.&quot;;    A timeless quality also pervaded a colorful collectionof furniture and accessories from Lexington Furniture Industries. Called TheWorld of Bob Timberlake, the collection includes a North Carolina pie safe,upholstery fabric taken from a quilt made by Timberlake's grandmother and anottoman upholstered to look like a drum.;    Contemporary furniture got a shotin the arm with such handsome furniture designs as those of Carlo Patti ofATACAB, a new Louisiana company. New table designs by Geri Andrews of diResinaResinart of Fairhope, Ala., also ran in a contemporary vein. Both collectionsfeatured exotic wood veneers and black, a kind of modern Biedermeier.;    Witheven the contemporary designs taking on traditional airs, it is obvious thefurnishings industry is hunkering for a long haul through a transitionaleconomic and design period.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  SAN FRANCISCO  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910202  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  753  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday February 2, 199100033033,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
