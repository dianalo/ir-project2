Synergen, which has surged 37% in the past week, climbedanother 2 1/2 to 57 as investors continue to be excited aboutthe Boulder, Colo., company's prospects for treating suchailments as rheumatoid arthritis, toxic and septic shock,cancer, bed sores and skin ulcers with its pipeline ofgenetically engineered products. Synergen's shares haveskyrocketed from 8 1/2 about a year ago.</LP><TEXT>   For the short term, Synergen has become too expensive,says John Kaweske, manager of biotechnology stocks for theFinancial Strategic Portfolio funds in Denver. Mr. Kaweske,who has cashed in his gains on about 25% of his four-year-oldSynergen holdings, says he doesn't expect the company to winfinal approval to market a product before 1994. But he addsthat he's hanging on to the rest because of what he calls thecompany's blockbuster potential.   Investors are closely watching two products now beingtested by Synergen: a human protein known as FibroblastGrowth Factor, which is being developed to treat chronic skinulcers and bed sores; and Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist,or IL-1ra, which Synergen is testing for the treatment ofinflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, septicshock and certain types of cancer.   Elsewhere, OTC stocks were mixed in light trading. TheNasdaq Composite Index rose 0.37 to 521.75, a 0.07% gain, aspre-holiday volume rose to 139.7 million shares from 112.3million Monday. Declining stocks outpaced advancers, 1,018 to910, as 140 shares climbed to new highs and 27 fell to newlows.   Intel, the day's most active OTC issue, rose 2 to 52 1/2and Apple Computer climbed 1 to 54, but Lotus DevelopmentSystems fell 1 1/4 to 38, Adobe Systems eased 1 to 51 1/2,MCI Communications eased 3/8 to 28 3/4 and Microsoft fell 1/2to 84 3/4.   Software Toolworks added 13/16 to 3 5/8 on nearly 1.3million shares amid investors' hopes that the beleagueredNovato, Calif., maker of entertainment software will profitfrom two software packages it will sell along with Nintendo'slongawaited 16-bit hardware system for video games. SoftwareToolworks, whose stock has been hammered as the companywrestled with losses, could turn a profit of 20 cents a shareby the fiscal third quarter, ending in December, PiperJaffray andamp; Hopwood analyst Bob Kleiber said in an interview.   But he cautions that the stock is risky: the company isswamped in inventories of its Miracle Piano Teaching System-- a keyboard that attaches to personal computers and employssoftware to teach users how to play the piano at their ownpace -- because it wasn't available until late in last year'sChristmas season. &quot;This is the key Christmas,&quot; says Mr.Kleiber, who expects nationwide advertising to help thecompany sell the product this year. If the advertising works,&quot;they can go right through that inventory,&quot; he says. But ifthe $350-to-$400 product doesn't catch on, Software Toolworks&quot;could have a big write-off they couldn't survive,&quot; hecautions.   Anticipation of the Nintendo product also sparked a 3/4gain to 3 7/8 in Acclaim Entertainment, which also makes asoftware game for the Nintendo system. Robert Holmes,president of Acclaim, told Dow Jones Professional InvestorReport that the Oyster Bay, N.Y., company &quot;is looking forblack ink&quot; in the current quarter after losing 36 cents ashare in the past quarter. Among other entertainment softwarecompanies, Electronic Arts climbed 1/4 to 24 1/8 and SierraOn-Line added 1/2 to 16.

Piper Jaffray andamp; Hopwood analyst Stephen M. Carnes trimmedhis estimate for Michael Foods for the third quarter to 30cents a share from 33 cents and for the fourth quarter to 37cents from 39 cents. The move in part reflected concern aboutMichael Foods' margins in potato and cheese products.   Trading in Xoma Corp. and Centocor Inc. was influenced byforthcoming Food and Drug Administration reviews of theirproducts and by analysts' assessments. Dow Jones ProfessionalInvestor Report said that an FDA advisory panel nextWednesday will review pending license applications forCentocor's Centoxin and Xoma's Xomen E5, which both are fortreatment of gram-negative infection.   Xoma, of Berkeley, Calif., received a favorablerecommendation by Cowen andamp; Co. analyst David K. Stone. Itgained 1/2 to 19 1/4 on 1.8 million shares, compared withaverage daily volume of 673,700.   However, Merrill Lynch analyst Stuart Weisbrod downgradedhis rating on Malvern, Pa.-based Centocor because of concernthat its product will get a restricted label recommendation,according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. Centocordropped 1 1/4 to 33 3/4.   Meanwhile, after jumping nearly 15% Monday, shares ofImmune Response rose another 1 1/4 to 22 5/8. The Carlsbad,Calif., company's shares are said to be benefitting fromfavorable expectations involving tests of Immune Response'stherapeutic vaccine for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.   Cambridge, Mass.-based Genzyme jumped 1 to 38 1/4. Thecompany said that it, in collaboration with Tufts Universityresearchers, has developed goats that secrete a version ofthe blood-clot-dissolving drug TPA in their milk. The companysaid the advance moves it significantly closer to acost-saving method for manufacturing therapeutic proteins viagenetically engineered animals. Genzyme's version of the drugmade in goats hasn't yet been tested in humans.   Earnings news again figured in the trading of severallistings.   Merrill Corp. of St. Paul, Minn., surged 3 to 20 1/2.
