Gorbachev and a resumption of U.S. aid toContra rebels in Nicaragua have high priority with President-electGeorge Bush as he prepares to move into the White House.   At a Houston news conference Wednesday in which he named James A.Baker III as his choice for secretary of state, Bush provided moreof an insight into his foreign policy views than he had throughoutthe election campaign.   Bush ruled out a meeting with Gorbachev just to get to know theSoviet leader. ``I am acquainted with him,'' Bush said. ``What Iwant to see is progress. I've never supported meetings just for thesake of having meetings.''   But he defined progress in a way that was far short of a demandthat a summit produce cosmic results. Bush said there were a numberof areas _ arms control, human rights, regional disputes _ in whichthe superpowers could make headway.   By offering a range of categories, the president-elect took apositive but cautious stance on summitry with Gorbachev. He said,for instance, that a summit would not have to produce a treaty tocut long-range nuclear weapons.   President Reagan, on the other hand, entered the White House inJanuary 1981 extremely reluctant to hold a summit. But afterGorbachev took over in 1985 the two leaders met annually _ fourtimes, in all.   Bush said that before he would meet with Gorbachev he would haveBaker confer with the foreign ministers of the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization and then with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.Shevardnadze.   ``But I don't think that will start before I become president,''he said.   Asked about the Contras, whose surreptitious receipt of millionsof dollars from U.S. secret arms sales to Iran rocked the Reaganadministration, Bush explicitly supported a resumption of aid.   Congress cut off all military assistance last February.Humanitarian aid, in the form of food, clothing and shelter, is dueto expire in March.   But Bush said aid to the rebels, who are at war with thegovernment in Nicaragua, ``will have a high priority because freedomand democracy in this hemisphere have a high priority.''   He said he intended ``to keep the pressure on the Sandinistas.''   In a third area, Bush said he believed the Soviets would adhereto their commitment to complete the withdrawal of their militaryforces from Afghanistan by Feb. 15.   If the Soviets do not pull out, Bush said, ``that will throw acomplicating factor over the whole relationship.''   In responding to reporters' questions, the president-electneither condemned the Soviet Union on any issue nor lobbed any toughrhetoric at Moscow. His overall tone on foreign policy was measured.   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, meanwhile, hailed Baker'sselection as a ``welcome and heartening event.''   In a news conference here, Shultz said Bush had telephoned himbefore announcing the selection. ``He will hit the ground running,''Shultz said of Baker, a Cabinet colleague and partner atinternational economic summit meetings.   ``His close, warm and productive relationship withpresident-elect Bush makes him just the guy to serve as thepresident's chief foreign policy adviser, and as chief spokesman forthe president and for our nation's interests,'' Shultz said.   Shultz and Baker both are considered moderate to conservative intheir political views and are internationally minded. Together, theytried without much success to reduce the U.S. trade deficit.</TEXT></DOC>
