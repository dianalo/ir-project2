That was the price Mexican magnate Carlos Slim and hisU.S. and French partners paid for control of thespectacularly inefficient telephone monopoly Telefonos deMexico S.A. Yet on a recent afternoon the receptionist at Mr.Slim's headquarters had to endure an aggravation common tomillions of their countrymen: a phone line on the blink.</LP><TEXT>   All right, so there are still kinks to be worked outbefore Telmex becomes a world-class telecommunicationscompany.   Mr. Slim and his partners, Southwestern Bell Corp. andFrance Telecom Inc., knew to expect a bit of a struggle whenthey bought into Telmex in December 1990. Though Mexico isthe world's 13th largest economy, it ranks 83rd in the worldin phone lines per capita. The average wait for a new line isthree years. The typical lag for repairs is several months.And even figures like these don't convey the depth of theproblems. Most Telmex pay phones operate for free becauserepair crews can't keep up with vandals. Lines are so oftencrossed that befuddled dialers commonly open a conversationby asking Adonde hablo? -- Where am I speaking?   But even as Mexican consumers have been complainingbitterly about Telmex, investors have been loving it. Whilecomplaints against Telmex were soaring 230% last year, itsstock price was climbing 237%. Some conservative U.S. mutualfunds were among the big buyers.   Maybe they knew something. For despite the immensity ofthe challenge, Mr. Slim's Telmex turnaround appears to be offto a promising start, telecommunications specialists say.Even though 1991 was considered a transitional year, the newowners managed to reduce costs by hundreds of millions ofdollars. They installed a record number of new lines.   And they improved at least some of the service. Mr. Slim,finally finding a line in his office that works, dials thenumber for reporting service problems and -- after a momentof suspense -- the call goes through. &quot;Our operator picked upin eight seconds,&quot; he says, checking his watch. &quot;Thatwouldn't have happened a year ago.&quot; When asked to fill outMr. Slim's first-year report card, an analyst at NomuraSecurities, Joanne Smith, gives him an A.   For investors, Telmex is a play on a country that's comingon strong. &quot;Buying Telmex is very much buying Mexico,&quot; saysRaul Solis, director general of Mexico's Banco International,which helped plan the 1990 Telmex privatization. And buyingMexico, a nation of 80 million rebounding after a decade ofeconomic stagnation, is very much in fashion. A record $5billion in foreign capital flowed into Mexican stocks lastyear, more than half of that money into Telmex.   Robert Lamons, a retired military officer from Lawton,Okla., took note of Telmex after hearing that there were onlyfive phone lines for every 100 Mexicans, half the phonedensity of the former Soviet Union. &quot;I thought, `Now there'sa company that's going to grow,'&quot; he says. Indeed it has;Telmex is expected to report that 1991 profit rose about 60%to around $1.8 billion as revenue grew about 30% to $5billion. The stock Mr. Lamons bought last summer has morethan doubled. (There are two ways to trade Telmex in theU.S.: The New York Stock exchange lists American depositaryshares that each represent 20 &quot;L&quot; shares with limited votingrights; quoted on the Nasdaq are Telmex ADRs that eachrepresent one full voting &quot;A&quot; share.)   Many telecommunications analysts think there's more tocome. Telmex outshines the U.S. Bell holding companies innearly every measure of growth potential, says analyst JackGrubman, who wrote a glowing Telmex report for PaineWebberInc. in November (&quot;the right company in the right country atthe right time&quot;). He sees earnings growing 25% annually forfive years, far faster than at the regional Bells. TheMexican government concession requires Telmex to increaselines by 12% a year through 1994, Mr. Grubman notes, addingthat favorable regulation preserves the company's monopolythrough 1996 and allows it flexibility on rate increases.   If the government has been kind to Telmex, it's paid off.Through the sale of the Telmex stake to Mr. Slim's group anda later public offering of Telmex shares, Mexico has earned atotal of $4.8 billion. The government still holds a 9.5%interest, worth $2.5 billion.   Southwestern Bell also has a warm place in its heart forTelmex. Its $953 million investment in 10% of Telmex has acurrent market value of $2.85 billion.   For Mr. Slim, sturdy as a lineman and rarely without a bigcigar, the task is to make service soar the way the stockprice has. The 51-year-old entrepreneur learned his firstlessons in business from his father, a Lebanese immigrant whoran a general store in Mexico City. The father taught hiseight-year-old son to use an accounting ledger to keep trackof every peso of his allowance. Maybe that explains the keeneye for a good buy that Mr. Slim displayed during the Mexicandebt crisis of the 1980s. While most businessmen were bailingout of Mexico, Mr. Slim built what's now Mexico's biggestbusiness empire, ranging from mines to tire factories tocafeterias.   &quot;Companies were absurdly undervalued,&quot; he says. &quot;Thiscountry has endured worse crises than that of the 1980s, andit has always survived.&quot; Mexican history is a passion for Mr.Slim, who has a valuable collection of books on the SpanishConquest and the Mexican Revolution.   He and his U.S. and French partners are hoping thatTelmex's customers will take the long view when consideringthe company's service problems. Notes John H. Atterbury,president of Southwestern Bell's Mexican operations: &quot;Telmexdidn't get this bad overnight, and it's not going to getbetter tomorrow.&quot;   Telmex was a more or less typically ineffective ThirdWorld utility until the 1980s, when it was racked by anatural disaster and a manmade one. The 1985 Mexico Cityearthquake severely damaged the Telmex network. Meanwhile,Mexico's debt depression kept the government from making thehuge investments needed to upgrade Telmex. In 1989, PresidentCarlos Salinas de Gortari said the only way to make Telmexwork was to privatize it.   In winning the controlling interest in Telmex, Mr. Slim'sgroup narrowly outbid a consortium that included GTE Corp.Mr. Slim pledged to invest $13 billion over six years todouble the number of phone lines. But he warned: &quot;One musthave patience.&quot;   He didn't realize how much patience would be needed untilhe got a good look inside. The first order of business wasreplacing Telmex's outdated analog technology with digital,which carries vastly more information. But the new managersencountered a mind-bending problem: For about a third of thelines in the system, Telmex lacked accurate information abouthow they were connected to the main network. &quot;Before you canchange lines you have to know where they run,&quot; says Mr.Atterbury. So Telmex is undertaking the laborious process ofchecking every line.   The new owners discovered that purchasing had beenconducted in a similarly haphazard fashion. An audit found$300 million of equipment scattered in 105 Telmex warehousesthroughout the country. The warehouses are being consolidatedinto just six equipment storage centers.   Mr. Slim's group had the opposite problem with maintenancecenters: They were too centralized. All of the repair crewsin Mexico City, which has 20 million residents, were crammedinto 11 buildings. In one center there were 300 repair trucks-- and one exit. It took an hour and a half each morningsimply to roll all of the trucks onto the street. The newmanagement built four maintenance centers last year and willadd 14 more this year. They will have multiple exits.   One of the most burdensome legacies was an agreement tobuy hundreds of millions of dollars worth of equipment overfive years from local affiliates of Stockholm-based TelefonAB L.M. Ericsson and Paris-based Alcatel N.V. According toPaineWebber's Mr. Grubman, Telmex's suppliers were chargingthe company three times what the Bell companies pay forswitches and other basic equipment. When Mr. Slim sought torenegotiate the agreement, he ignited a battle that draggedon all last year. &quot;They were tough, tough, negotiations,&quot;says Rodrigo Calderon, an executive at Alcatel. &quot;The newTelmex is not an easy client.&quot;   Unable to get the suppliers to budge after months ofbargaining, Mr. Slim played hardball: He threatened to deferall of the purchases Telmex was obligated to make under thefive-year agreement until the final year. Facing the prospectof four lean years, the suppliers agreed to lower Telmex'sequipment rates by $250 million in 1992. To ensure thatEricsson's and Alcatel's prices stay competitive, Telmex hasbrought in American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. as a thirdsupplier.   &quot;In a remarkably brief time, Slim has succeeded in givingTelmex a much more business-like management culture,&quot; saysJorge Arredondo, an Ericsson executive.   Having spent last year doing that, Mr. Slim now hopes toconcentrate on building up the network. Juan Antonio PerezSimon, director general, says line growth for 1992 shouldreach 14%, well above the government's mandate. Telmex isexpanding pay phone service by putting lines in mom and popstores, where the presence of the store owners discouragesvandals. Construction of an 8,000-mile fiber optic lineconnecting 54 cities is ahead of schedule.   Operators, who for years labored at 1940s vintageswitchboards, are switching to computerized systems thatenable them to handle 50 calls an hour, instead of thecurrent 15. &quot;We're shipping these to a museum,&quot; says EmmaRosa Hernandez, a supervisor, pointing to the old ones.   Technology won't solve all of Telmex's service problems.Even after it replaced the switchboards, management had tohaggle with the balky telephone workers' union to reassignthe people needed to run the new computers. That points tothe biggest potential problem with the Telmex privatization:The owners and equipment may be new, but the workers are alltoo familiar. To prevent the powerful 45,000member phoneworkers' union from blocking the privatization, thegovernment specified in its concession that Telmex's newowner couldn't make layoffs.   Telmex has nearly twice as many employees per line as theaverage Bell company. Productivity has always beensubstandard. Repair crews have traditionally sold theirservices to the highest bidder. Telmex linemen for yearsrefused to use cable protected with rain-proof jelly, becauseit was slippery to handle.   To offer employees an incentive to work harder, theprivatization scheme gave the union a 4.4% stake in Telmex.It's still early, but there are signs that more of a workethic is finally emerging within the work force. The unionhas disavowed several workers fired for corruption. Linemenhave agreed to give the waterproof cable a trial. Oneoperator has decorated her new computer terminal with a cardthat says: &quot;Be understanding of people's mistakes and theywill be understanding of yours.&quot;   In the wake of the privatization, however, Telmexcustomers are no longer so understanding. &quot;People expectedservice to improve dramatically overnight,&quot; sighs Mr. Slim.It hasn't. Last summer's unusually heavy rains left the phonenetwork as fouled up as it had been in years.   The combination of high expectations and high wateraccounted for last year's 230% increase in complaints aboutTelmex to the attorney general for the consumer, a governmentombudsman. One typically unsatisfied customer is MarcelinoHernandez. He tells a Telmex lawyer and an arbitrator for theattorney general that he's been overbilled for 90,000 pesos($30). The Telmex attorney suggests Mr. Hernandez has made amathematical error. But the customer has his records, and thearbitrator quickly rules in his favor. &quot;The new Telmex-hah,&quot;says Mr. Hernandez, stalking out.   Antonio Arrona Lopez, the Telmex lawyer, is resigned todealing with people who'd like to reach out and throttle him.&quot;Every day they cuss at you and call you a thief,&quot; he says.He loses 80% of his cases, which would get him fired frommost corporate legal departments. &quot;But that's a pretty goodrecord,&quot; he says, &quot;considering I'm defending Telmex.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
