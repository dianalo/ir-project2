The indictment, which resulted from a huge federal investigation into the Texas savings-and-loan industry, accused Mr. Gaubert of arranging for Capitol Savings andamp; Loan of Mt. Pleasant, Iowa, to finance a &quot;land flip&quot; in Texas from which Mr. Gaubert allegedly cleared $5.6 million.    The grand jury, in Des Moines, Iowa, charged Mr. Gaubert with five felony counts including wire fraud and making false statements. The indictment said he failed to disclose to Capitol Savings and to federal and state regulators that he stood to gain from the transaction.    If convicted, Mr. Gaubert could face penalties of up to 27 years in prison and fines totaling $18,000.    Mr. Gaubert, who has consistently denied any wrongdoing in the matter, declined to comment when contacted yesterday.    Mr. Gaubert's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said his client was being singled out unfairly. &quot;Were it any other person, the Justice Department would not have proceeded,&quot; said Mr. Lowell. A spokesman for Speaker Wright declined to comment on the indictment.    Mr. Gaubert is a prominent Democratic party fund-raiser. He was finance chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee during 1986, and was finance chairman of a Fort Worth fund-raising dinner late last year that realized nearly $1 million for Mr. Wright. He is a member of Rep. Richard Gephardt's presidential finance committee.    The indictment charges that he bought 44 acres of land in Dallas County, Texas, in 1983 at less than 50 cents a square foot, then sold it the same day through a middleman for $5.25 a square foot. The sale was financed by an $8 million loan from Capitol that Mr. Gaubert helped arrange.    The buyers of the 44 acres later defaulted on the loan, and officials at Capitol sued Mr. Gaubert, alleging that he had misled them. Federal prosecutors began a grand jury investigation, but appeared to drop the matter in 1985 after Mr. Gaubert settled the lawsuit by agreeing to buy back the land from Capitol, which had foreclosed, for the amount it had loaned.    The criminal inquiry was revived after federal prosecutors began combing through several Texas thrifts that have collapsed into insolvency with massive losses to the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., including one in which Mr. Gaubert was a principal stockholder. At the same time, news accounts, including some in this newspaper, were linking Mr. Gaubert to Rep. Wright, who in 1986 asked the chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to listen to Mr. Gaubert's complaints that regulators were treating him unfairly.    Bank Board officials had refused to allow Mr. Gaubert to exercise control of his thrift, Independent American Savings Association, while they investigated his role in the 1983 Capitol transaction. Eventually regulators concluded that Mr. Gaubert was unfit to be a thrift manager, and secured his agreement to withdraw from Independent American. Later, however, Mr. Gaubert accused regulators of tricking him.    Despite Rep. Wright's intervention, the regulators refused to relent, and Mr. Gaubert is currently suing them to regain control of the thrift.    Meanwhile, Independent American has been placed in receivership with losses that regulators place in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Mr. Gaubert blames regulators for the losses.    &quot;The Justice Department reopened this case only after Tom Gaubert started fighting back against the federal regulators,&quot; Mr. Lowell said. </TEXT></DOC>
