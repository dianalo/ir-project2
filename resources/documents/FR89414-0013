Dole announced the start of a program designedto identify and prosecute pilots who failed to declare drug- or alcohol-relatedconvictions on applications for airman medical certificates. Under thisprogram, the OIG announced its intention to conduct two computer matchesas part of an investigative effort to gather specific, detailed information(52 FR 5374; February 20, 1987) (52 FR 8545; March 18, 1987). For the firstmatch, the OIG matched the Automated Medical Certification Data Base (theFAA's medical files) with certain records from the Identification Recordsof criminal history information of the Federal Bureau of Investigation(FBI). For the second match, the OIG matched the FAA's Automated MedicalCertification Data Base with the State of Florida Department of HighwaySafety and Motor Vehicles driver's license records involving alcohol- ordrug-related traffic offenses.The matching program resulted in the identification of a significant numberof airmen who appear to have falsified their applications for airman medicalcertification with regard to drug convictions and drug- or alcohol-relatedtraffic convictions. The OIG has now referred to the FAA more than 6,000cases which it discovered as a result of the matching program.On October 22, 1987, the FAA issued a notice of enforcement policy, whichconcerned cases of airmen who may have falsified their applications forairman medical certification by failing to disclose a record of trafficconvictions. The notice was published at 52 FR 41557 (October 29, 1987).That notice stated, in part, the following:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Inspector General has identified some airmen who appear to havefalsified their applications with regard to their record of traffic convictions.That information is being provided to the FAA for appropriate action. Asof January 1, 1988, the FAA intends to take appropriate enforcement actionbased on falsification of the application with respect to those cases providedto the FAA by the IG, as well as any other cases of which the FAA has becomeor becomes aware, which appear to warrant such action.</ITAG>The notice explained that persons who failed to disclose a record of trafficconvictions on their applications for airman medical certification mayhave violated andSection; 67.20 of the Federal Aviation Regulations. Thenotice also announced a policy under which such persons could avoid FAAcertificate enforcement action, for falsification, by providing the FAAwith corrected information. With regard to this policy, which has oftenbeen referred to as the FAA's ``amnesty program,'' the notice stated:<ITAG tagnum="20">* * * from the date of this notice and until further notice, wherethe airman has voluntarily supplied to the FAA's Aeromedical CertificationBranch information regarding a record of traffic convictions in his orher medical application prior to the FAA's becoming aware of any incorrectstatement in the application, the FAA will not take action against theairman's certificates on the basis of falsification for any falsificationdisclosed by such voluntarily disclosed information.</ITAG>This policy terminated on December 1, 1988, pursuant to a notice of enforcementpolicy issued on October 27, 1988, which was published at 52 FR 44166 (November1, 1988).In addition to the cases involving a record of traffic convictions, theOIG has also referred a number of cases involving drug convictions. Thisnotice announces the FAA's policy with regard to its enforcement actionin the OIG-referred cases as well as in similar cases which otherwise maycome to the FAA's attention.Applicants for an airman medical certificate who have failed to disclosea record of traffic or other convictions may have violated andSection; 67.20of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 67.20). Section 67.20 provides,in pertinent part, that no person may make or cause to be made any fraudulentor intentionally false statement on any application for an airman medicalcertificate. Section 67.20 further provides that a violation of its termsis a basis for suspending or revoking any airman, ground instructor, ormedical certificate or rating held by the violator.Persons who made false statements on an application for an airman medicalcertificate may be criminally prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. 1001, which carriesa fine or a term of imprisonment for up to 5 years, or both. The Departmentof Justice, not the FAA, determines whether to prosecute a person underthis statute.As noted above, the FAA has received a number of cases involving personswho have drug convictions. In addition to possible violations of andSection;67.20, information regarding drug convictions has implications for actionagainst airman and other certificates under andSection;andSection; 61.15(a),63.12(a), and 65.12(a) of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 61.15(a),andSection; 63.12(a), and andSection;65.12(a)) and/or section 609(c) of theFederal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, (49 U.S.C. App. 1429(c)). Sections61.15(a), 63.12(a) and 65.12(a) state:<ITAG tagnum="21">(a) A conviction for the violation of any Federal or State statuterelating to the growing, processing, manufacture, sale, disposition, possession,transportation, or importation of narcotic drugs, marijuana, or depressantor stimulant drugs or substances is grounds for_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) Denial of an application for any certificate or rating issuedunder this part for a period of up to 1 year after the date of final conviction;or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Suspension or revocation of any certificate or rating issued underthis part.</ITAG>Section 609(c) provides, in part, that:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Administrator shall issue an order revoking the airman certificatesof any person upon conviction of such person of a crime that is punishableby death or imprisonment for a term exceeding 1 year under a State or Federallaw relating to a controlled substance (other than a law relating to simplepossession of a controlled substance), if the Administrator determinesthat (A) an aircraft was used in the commission of the offense or to facilitatethe commission of the offense, and (B) such person served as an airman,or was on board such aircraft, in connection with the commission of theoffense or the facilitation of the commission of the offense. The Administratorshall have no authority under this paragraph to review the issue of whetheran airman violated a State or Federal law relating to a controlled substance.</ITAG>Section 609(c) includes a similar provision with respect to the revocationof airman certificates of persons who, although not convicted, have knowinglyengaged in such an activity. Section 609(c) applies to acts which occurafter its effective date of October 19, 1984. Under section 602(b)(2) anyperson whose airman certificate is revoked under section 609(c) may notbe issued a new airman certificate for a period of 5 years, unless theAdministrator determines that circumstances warrant otherwise. On November18, 1988 the President signed into law Pub. L. 100-690, which amended sections602(b) and 609(c) by deleting the 5-year revocation period and foreverprohibiting the re-issuance of an airman certificate revoked under Section609(c) unless the Administrator, upon the request of a Federal or Statelaw enforcement official, determines that a waiver of revocation actionor re-issuance of an airman certificate will facilitate law enforcementefforts.Accordingly, if a case involves a drug conviction as well as falsificationof the medical certificate application, enforcement action may be takenunder andSection;andSection; 61.15, 63.12, or 65.12 and/or section 609(c),as well as under andSection; 67.20. Also, even if it is determined that actionunder andSection; 67.20 (for falsification) is not warranted, action underthe other sections may still be taken in cases involving drug convictions.The answers to the questions regarding whether an airman has ever had arecord of traffic or other convictions are important because they may indicatea medical problem or may lead to further inquiry regarding an applicant'smedical qualifications. (For example, driving under the influence may indicatealcoholism). The integrity of the entire medical qualification system isdependent on the truthfulness of the applicant. When an applicant is untruthful,the aviation medical examiner may be prevented from conducting a properfitness review. In every case referred by the OIG, as well as in othersimilar cases, the FAA will take action. This notice outlines that action.In all cases in which a prior drug- or alcohol-related conviction has beenomitted from an application, further medical certificates will not be issuedunless the required full disclosure is made on subsequent application forms,regardless of how old the conviction may be. (If an aviation medical examinerissues a certificate in such a case, action will be taken to reverse theissuance or revoke the certificate, as appropriate.) Because of the large number of cases referred and the limitations on theagency's investigative and legal resources, the agency will not initiatelegal enforcement action, against currently held medical or airman certificatesin most cases involving relatively older convictions unless it is determinedthat the airman is not medically qualified to hold a medical certificate.The FAA has determined that certificate action (hereinafter described)will ordinarily be initiated only in cases involving driving while intoxicated(DWI) or driving under the influence (DUI) convictions which occurred afterFebruary 17, 1984, which is 3 years before the FBI matching program wasannounced by the Department of Transportation. Such a 3-year ``lookback''period is consistent with the approach taken by Congress in the Airportand Airway Safety and Capacity Expansion Act of 1987, under which Congresshas allowed the FAA access to National Driver Register (NDR) information.Congress generally limited that access to information on convictions occurringnot more than 3 years prior to a request for NDR information. Similarly,because of resource limitations, the same ``lookback'' period will be appliedto most drug convictions. Notwithstanding this ``lookback'' period, the FAA reserves the prerogativeto take certificate action in any case it considers aggravated even ifit falls outside the 3-year ``lookback'' period. In all cases, including those in which certificate action based on falsificationand/or convictions is not taken under this policy, the FAA will reviewthe individual's medical eligibility, and take action, if appropriate.In addition, any person who has omitted from an application informationregarding drug- or alcohol-related convictions, even persons against whomno certificate action is taken under this policy for prior falsifications,is reminded that failure to fill out any future application completelyand truthfully may lead to denial or revocation of medical certificates.Such a failure will also make them subject to action against their airmanand ground instructor certificates, as well as potential criminal sanctions.The FAA believes that safety in air commerce or air transportation andthe public interest require the certificate actions provided under thisnotice of policy. Thus, for example, in those cases in which revocationis ordered, that sanction reflects the FAA's view that a lack of qualificationto hold the certificate(s) exists. Below is an outline of the sanctionswhich will generally be ordered by the FAA in these cases. The FAA reservesthe prerogative to take more or less stringent actions in individual caseswhere aggravating or mitigating circumstances are present. For example,if a falsification becomes known to the FAA only by the airman's voluntarydisclosure of accurate information, that fact might be considered in mitigation.A. Falsification of Convictions for Driving While Intoxicated or DrivingUnder the Influence (hereinafter DUI) (Cases involving andSection; 67.20).(While the vast majority of DUIs involve alcohol, they might also involvedriving under the influence of another drug.) 1. For a single DUI conviction, revocation of any current medical certificatesand suspension of any airman or ground instructor certificates for 60 days.(Suspension of the airman or ground instructor certificates will be orderedeven if the airman holds no current medical certificate.) The 60-day suspension period applies only in a case which involves falsificationof a single DUI conviction alone. Thus, if some other information has alsobeen omitted, (e.g., treatment for alcoholism), another, more severe sanctionmay be imposed. 2. For multiple DUIs, revocation of any current medical certificate and,except in extraordinary circumstances, any airman or ground instructorcertificates. B. Drug Convictions (Cases involving andSection;andSection; 61.15, 63.12, and65.12 and/or 609(c)) and Falsification of Drug Convictions. (Cases involvingandSection; 67.20.) 1. For a single conviction for simple possession, revocation of any currentmedical certificates and suspension of any ground instructor certificate,or any airman or other certificates issued under Parts 61, 63, or 65, for180 days. (Suspension of the airman certificate will be ordered even ifthe airman holds no current medical certificate.) The 180-day suspension period applies only in a case which involves falsficationof a single conviction for possession alone. Thus, if some other informationhas also been omitted, (e.g., treatment for drug dependence), another,more severe sanction may be imposed. 2. For one conviction for more than simple possession revocation of anycurrent medical certificates and, except in extraordinary circumstances,any ground instructor certificate, or any airman or other certificatesissued under Parts 61, 63, or 65. 3. For two or more drug convictions of any type, revocation of any currentmedical certificate and, except in extraordinary circumstances, any groundinstructor certificate, or any airman or other certificates issued underParts 61, 63, or 65. C. Drug Convictions Which Do Not Involve Falsification of Medical CertificateApplication. (Cases Under andSection;andSection; 61.15, 63.12, 65.12 and/or609(c)). 1. For single conviction for simple possession, suspension of any airmanor other certificates issued under Parts 61, 63, or 65 for 120 days. 2. For one conviction for more than a simple possession, except in extraordinarycircumstances, revocation of any airman or other certificates issued underParts 61, 63, or 65. 3. For two or more convictions, except in extraordinary circumstances,revocation of any airman or other certificates issued under Parts 61, 63,or 65. The FAA will also take appropriate action, when and as necessary, in casesinvolving drug convictions but no charge of falsification, in order todetermine whether the airman is qualified to hold a medical certificate.The enforcement policy set forth in this notice applies only to the convictionsspecified. The FAA reserves the right to take enforcement action in casesinvolving failure to disclose other types of convictions, as appropriate.Similarly, the falsification addressed in this policy relates to airmanmedical certificate applications. The FAA reserves the right to take enforcementaction in cases involving falsification of other types of documents.<ITAG tagnum="84">Availability of this Notice </ITAG>Any person may obtain a copy of this notice by submitting a request tothe Federal Aviation Administration, Office of Public Affairs, Attention:Public Inquiry Center, APA-230, 800 Independence Avenue SW., Washington,DC 20591, or by calling (202) 267-3484.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC on April 11, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Robert E.
