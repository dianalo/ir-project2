The new figures were provided to scientists at a meeting inDenver last week, while a detailed analysis is expected to be madepublic sometime next month, explained Ozzie Girard, the survey'sdeputy assistant director for engineering geology.   The survey now estimates reserves of undiscovered crude oil at33.4 billion barrels, well below the 54.6 billion estimated in a1981 study.   In addition, the agency has lowered its estimates of thenation's reserves of undiscovered natural gas at 254 trillion cubicfeet, down from the previous estimate of 426.8 trillion.   Girard said today that the figures issued in Denver werepreliminary, and the survey is preparing reports that will detailits findings by region and will also explain the methods used toarrive at the nunber and the assumptions made by the scientistsinvolved.   The new figures, termed working papers by Girard, are based on atwo-year study looking at drilling results in the last few years.   There are two main reasons for the lower estimates. One, ofcourse, is that some previously undiscovered oil and gas fieldshave now been found.   In addition, however, unsuccessful drilling efforts in someareas that had been thought to be promising have caused scientiststo lower their expectations for new finds, officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
