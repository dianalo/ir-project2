Gold prices were mostly lower. Republic National Bank of NewYork quoted a bid of $381.80 for a troy ounce of gold at 4 p.m.EST, compared with $383.00 late Tuesday.   The dollar closed higher in Europe and remained relativelystrong when dealing shifted to New York. Traders noted thatactivity had slowed to a trickle in the afternoon and that buyingwas mostly speculative in nature.   ``The dollar has made a key surge to the upside and is nowbeginning to stabilize,'' said Jack Barbanel, a senior vicepresident at Gruntal andamp; Co.   Traders believe that there is still room for interest rates tomove higher, despite a spate of recent government statisticsshowing the economy may be cooling down. Higher interest ratessupport the dollar by making dollar-denominated securities moreattractive.   The major central banks, with the exception of the influentialBank of Japan, tried to depress the dollar by selling the currency,but analysts noted that their effort was restrained.   While the central banks want to make their presence known, ``onegets the impression that they are not willing to really turn themarket around at this stage,'' said Steve Leach, a currency analystat Chemical Bank.   Feeding that sentiment were comments by Michael Boskin, chairmanof the Council of Economic Advisers, who indicated the dollarremains at competitive levels for U.S. manufacturers despite itsrise this week to seven-month highs.   Also underlying the bullish mood is anticipation of hefty dollarbuying from Japan, where the fiscal year is about to end and wherea plethora of 10-year bonds are coming due, thereby freeing up asubstantial amount of cash that could be invested in U.S.securities.   There is some fear, however, that ``if the market keeps pushingthe dollar higher, the central banks may respond moreaggressively,'' Leach said.   Traders said there was little reaction to a Commerce Departmentreport showing the government's chief economic forecasting gaugedropped 0.3 percent in February after gaining sharply in theprevious two months. The decline had been expected.   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 133.25 Japanese yen, up from132.30. Later in London, it traded at 132.73 yen. In New York, thedollar rose to 133.12 yen, from 133.10 yen Tuesday.   The British pound fell after government figures showed Britishimports continued to grow faster than exports. Britain's currentaccount deficit totaled $2.88 billion in February, higher than the$2.47 billion deficit analysts had forecast.   The pound has lost nearly 9.5 cents against the dollar sincemid-February. One British pound cost $1.6870 in London lateWednesday, cheaper for buyers than Tuesday's $1.7030. In New Yorkit cost $1.6875 to buy one pound, more expensive than Wednesday's$1.6855.
