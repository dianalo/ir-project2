The Order addresses the sealrequirements when sales are based on measurement by tank gauging, leaseautomatic custody transfer units, or combinations thereof. The Order alsocovers site security plans, facility diagrams, transporters' documentation,unauthorized removal or mishandling of production, and the recordkeepingand reporting requirements related thereto. In addition, the Order detailsenforcement actions and allows for variances from specific standards. Thisfinal rulemaking also amends 43 CFR 3164.1, Onshore Oil and Gas Orders,paragraph (b).

Comments were received from18 sources: 3 industry associations, 9 industry entities, 1 Indian tribe,and 5 government entities. Three of the industry entities supported thecomments submitted by 1 of the associations and also submitted their owncomments. Several changes and additions were made in the definition section for clarificationin response to the comments. Changes were made in the requirements sectionboth to correspond to the definition changes published May 16, 1988 (53FR 17362), and in response to comments. Those comments relating directly to the proposed rulemaking have been groupedby subject matter and will be discussed as a group rather than individually.Those comments not directly related to the proposed rulemaking will bereferred to the appropriate Bureau office for review and any action deemednecessary. <ITAG tagnum="84">Appendix   </ITAG>It has been determined that it is not necessary to include sections from43 CFR Subparts 3163 and 3165 in the copies of Order No. 3 to be printedfor distribution to the public. References to those sections in the tableof contents and Part II of the Appendix have therefore been removed inthe final rulemaking.   <ITAG tagnum="84">I.B. Purpose   </ITAG>One comment expressed concern that the Order did not amend andSection;andSection;3162.7-1 and 3162.7-5 but merely supplemented them. The intent of the Orders,of which this is the third, as stated in andSection; 3164.1, Onshore Oiland Gas Orders, is to implement and supplement the regulations containedin 43 CFR Part 3160. Because technical requirements are more appropriatelyaddressed in an Onshore Oil and Gas Order than in general regulations,many of the provisions of andSection;andSection; 3162.7-1 and 3162.7-5 havebeen transferred to this Order. The Bureau intends to amend andSection; 3162.7-5after the effective date of this Order to remove any duplication betweenthe Order and the regulations. Because of this upcoming change, all referencesto the definitions contained in andSection; 3162.7-5 have been removed inthe final rulemaking. However, references to definitions contained elsewherein 43 CFR Part 3000 have been retained for ease of reference.   The second sentence of the second paragraph of section I.B. has been amendedto clarify the purpose of the Order in regard to extension of abatementtimes and review of contested enforcement actions.   <ITAG tagnum="84">I.C. Scope   </ITAG>Two comments were submitted. One comment suggested modification of thissection to reflect the language contained in 43 CFR 3161.1, Jurisdiction.The modification has been adopted, and the language has been changed tobe consistent with the regulation. The other comment expressed concernas to jurisdiction over units that are not approved by the Federal Governmentand that contain Federal and Indian interests that are a small fractionof the unit. The language contained in this Order is consistent with theregulations. As was stated in the final rulemaking amending the regulationsat 43 CFR Part 3160, 52 FR 5384 (February 20, 1987): <ITAG tagnum="21">The fact that Federal or Indian lands are committed to agreementsfor the purpose of drilling and development of those lands in the mostbeneficial manner is all that is needed to establish the responsibilityof the Bureau of Land Management to ensure that the intent of the FederalOil and Gas Royalty Management Act and other mineral leasing laws as toroyalty accountability is carried out on those lands. </ITAG>This policy was recently upheld by the District Court of Montana in <T3>Norfolk Energy, Inc., Formerly Known as Tricentral United States, Inc.v. Hodel,</T3> Civ. No. 87-188 (D. Mont., September 28, 1988), appeal filed(9th Cir., November 23, 1988).   <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Definitions   </ITAG>Access. This definition has been modified for clarification and consistencywith the existing regulations in 43 CFR Part 3160 and the contents of thisOrder to include components in measurement systems, because componentscan also affect the determination of the quality and quantity of the liquidbeing measured. As proposed, the definition would have erroneously appliedonly to valves.   Authorized officer. A few comments suggested the need for a definitionfor ``authorized officer.'' This term is defined at 43 CFR 3000.0-5(e),but has been included in this Order for convenient reference.   Authorized representative. One comment suggested amendment of this definitionto require the authorized representative to provide certification to thelessee of proper authorization from the Secretary. All certified inspectorsare required to carry identification cards with such certification. Becausethis is already provided for in the certification program, it is not necessaryto include this requirement in the Order, and the suggestion is not adopted.  Business day. Two comments suggested that the term ``working day'' be clearlydefined. The Bureau agrees that ``working day'' can be ambiguous, withweekends and holidays being working days in some circumstances. The term``working day'' has been removed and replaced by ``business day'', whichshould eliminate misunderstanding.   Condensate. Several comments suggested that condensate be included in thedefinition of ``oil''. There is an exclusion from the seal requirements(III. 1. e. iv.) when a gas well produces small amounts of condensate andonly one tank is available for production, storage, and sales purposes.The exception applies only to gas well condensate, not oil, production.The suggestion is not adopted and a definition for condensate is beingadded to make it clear that oil is treated differently from gas well condensate.  Effectively sealed. The definition has been amended to cover componentsin LACT units, for the same reasons contained in the discussion of thedefinition of ``access'', above.   Facility. A few comments suggested that a definition for ``facility'' beadded and the word ``site'' be removed from the Order and replaced withthe word ``facility.'' All suggested definitions contained the word ``site''.The suggestion to remove ``site'' from the Order is not adopted, becausethe terms are synonymous. However, one of the suggested definitions for``facility'' has been included as part of the Order as compatible withthe purpose and intent of the rulemaking.   Gas. Two comments questioned the use of the word ``ordinary'' in this definitionas vague. The definition in the Order is consistent with the regulationsin 43 CFR Part 3160, and it would be inappropriate to change it in theOrder. For clarification, however, in general circumstances ``ordinary''has historically been interpreted to mean ``atmospheric,'' and for purposesof this Order this continues to be true.    Lease. One comment suggested that the phrase ``on or from Federal or Indianlands'' be added. The definition for this term is contained in 43 CFR 3160.0-5(f).The suggested changes are unnecessary because the definition already refersto enterprises controlled in some way by the United States under a mineralleasing law, and therefore can apply only to Federal and Indian lands.Lessee. The definition of lessee has been amended for consistency withthe final rulemaking published on May 16, 1988 (53 FR 17362). Major violation. Two comments were made. One comment approved of the definitionand the other suggested removal of the language relating to public health,safety and environment. The suggested change is not adopted. The definitionin the regulations for major violation, which may be found at 43 CFR 3160.0-5(j),is used in this Order to conform to the regulations. Minor violation. One comment suggested amending the definition to restatespecifically the components of a major violation that a minor violationdoes not include. The comment is not adopted, because mere restatementof these components would be redundant, and the current definition of minorviolation is sufficiently clear. Moderate violation. One comment argued that the definition for ``moderateviolation'' contained in earlier versions of the regulations should beretained. The term ``moderate violation'' was removed from the regulationsgoverning these Orders when the regulations were amended on February 20,1987 (52 FR 5384). The definition is not included in the final rulemakingin order to conform to the regulations. Mishandling. Several comments requested clarification of the meaning ofmishandling. A definition has been added to this Order. Oil. Three comments suggested modifying the definition to include afterthe word substances ``at atmospheric temperature and pressure.'' The definitionis statutory and may be found at 43 CFR 3000.0-5. Condensate is excluded,but only for the purposes stated in III.1.e.iv. of this Order. Bad oil, etc. Two comments suggested that the terms ``bad oil,'' ``cleanoil/pipeline oil,'' ``slop oil,'' and ``waste oil'' be considered subsetsof the definition of oil and be organized as such in alphabetical order.The suggestion has been adopted as a practical and sensible approach andthe change made. Waste oil. A few comments suggested that tank bottoms should be added tothe definition. It has been the policy of the Bureau that when an operatorpresents data substantiating that leasehold oil can neither be treatedwith existing or portable equipment nor disposed of to a reclaimer, itis considered waste oil, whether tank bottoms or oil residue in pits. Thesuggested changes are not adopted. Operator. One comment suggested a modification of this definition by insertingthe word ``responsible'' between ``the'' and ``party'' in the first sentence.The definition for operator as published on May 16, 1988 (53 FR 17362),has been included in this Order. Seal. One comment suggested amending the definition to include the phrase``designated not to be reused''. This suggestion has not been adopted becauseseals are manufactured so that once used they actually cannot be used again.However, the definition has been modified to complement the definitionin this Order of ``effectively sealed'' and the requirements for sealingLACT components affecting quality and/or quantity. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Requirements </ITAG>A.1.a. One comment suggested rewriting the paragraph because in the opinionof the writer seals do not provide a means for documenting the removalof production. If seals are properly used, and the use thereof properlyand accurately documented, it will provide a means of documenting the removalof production from a facility. The suggestion is therefore not adopted.A.1.b. Several comments were made relating to the specific valves thatrequired sealing, and the necessity for the sealing device to be at thesite. Other comments asserted that each ineffectively sealed valve, orappropriate valve not sealed, should not be a separate violation. The paragraphhas been modified as to the valves requiring sealing and the location ofthe sealing devices. However, each ineffective seal or missing seal continuesto constitute a separate violation, as this is considered necessary toensure adequate compliance with the requirement, but valve seal violationsother than violations affecting the sales valve have been changed to minorviolations in the final Order. Oil is not readily accessible from the othervalves as it is from the sales valve, and failure to seal these other valveseffectively is not likely to lead to nonrecoupable loss of the resource.A.1.e.i. Four comments requested clarification of this exclusion as itpertains to production vessels. The provision has been reworded to specifythat valves on production vessels are excluded, as well as valves on tanksused as production vessels. The wording has also been amended to make itclear that the listed vessels are intended to be examples of vessel typesrather than the only acceptable vessels. A.1.e.ii. This exclusion from the seal requirements has been modified toidentify those piping systems through which access to production couldoccur. A.1.e.iv. Four comments suggested removal of the term ``condensate'' andthe substitution of the word ``oil.'' As stated previously in II. Definitions,the exclusion from the requirement that fill lines be effectively sealedapplies only to condensate production, and was not intended for oil production.The suggestion is not adopted. A.1.e.viii. Four comments requested that vent lines be included in theexclusions for clarity. The request has been adopted and vent lines havebeen added. In practice, vent lines have always been excluded from thegeneral requirement that valves be sealed. A.1.g. This paragraph has been modified to reflect the change in A.1.b.,as was suggested in comments. A.2.a. Several comments suggested various changes in this paragraph relatingto proper position of a valve, the severity of violation for each ineffectivelysealed or unsealed valve, the abatement period, and sealing requirementsduring various production activities. Consistent with the changes madein paragraphs A.1.b. and A.1.g., the violation has been changed from majorto minor for all valves except the sales valve. The abatement periods havealso been modified. A.2.b. A few comments suggested modification of this paragraph relatingto the location of the devices used for sealing purposes to allow themto be stored at a centralized field location rather than at each site,and questions were raised regarding the severity of the violation. ParagraphA.1.b. was amended to allow sealing devices to be stored with the operator'srepresentative or in a centralized field administrative location. Thischange has been included in this paragraph as well as in paragraph A.1.b.Whether sealable valves and seals or devices and seals are used is notmaterial. The degree of the violation and the abatement period would bethe same. The changes have been made. B.1. Several comments suggested that each ineffective or missing seal notbe a separate violation. As previously stated in the response to commentson paragraph A.1.b., the Bureau considers each seal violation as a separateviolation. A comment suggested that the abatement period for sealing componentsbe extended. Given the potential loss of mineral revenue, a 24-hour abatementperiod is considered to be adequate. The term ``working day'' has beenchanged to 24 hours for clarity, because ``business day'' excludes weekendsand Federal holidays. Another comment stated that the purchaser shouldbe responsible for maintaining seals on LACT units. The operator is consideredthe party responsible for compliance with the lease terms, regulations,and Orders. Therefore, no change is being made as to responsibility. C.1.a. Several comments suggested various changes to this paragraph asit relates to the identification requirements involving the lease, communitization,or unit agreement number, the location of the facility, and posting thetime of the transaction. The time requirement has been removed becausetime of removal is immaterial to production accountability. Other requirementswere retained because the required identification should be readily availablefrom the sign required pursuant to 43 CFR 3162.6, Well and facility identification.Without the proper identification on a run ticket there would always bea question as to the point of origin of the oil being transported. Thesuggestion that the violation be downgraded to minor is not adopted. Thesource of the oil is information vital to production and royalty accountability.The abatement period has been increased to 3 business days and the requirementfor the time has been removed. This allows the operator greater flexibilityand will not adversely affect production accountability. C.1.b. Several comments suggested changes. One suggested removing the entireparagraph, two questioned the need for the recording time, and one questionedthe need for the signature of the operator's representative. The time requirementhas been removed as unnecessary. The term ``working day'' was removed and``business day'' was used for all the abatement periods. The signatureof the operator's representative is required since it is considered tosignify acceptance of the documentation of the sale or removal of oil fromthe facility. C.1.c. Several comments were received relating to a completed run ticket,possession of such a run ticket by the driver of the truck which completesthe sale or removal of production from the facility, the sealing of allother valves except the sales line valve, deletion of the operator-purchaserresponsibility, and the unloading of the truck when proper documentationis not available. Changes in this paragraph have been made to specify thatthe information required in run tickets is that specified in G.1. a. andb. Changes have also been made to make it clear that all valves on linesentering or leaving sales tanks be required to be sealed between truckloadsexcept the sales and vent line valves in light of the provision that onlythe final truck of a group of trucks needs to carry the sales documentation.The requirement to unload the trucks has been removed because all trucksdo not have pumping equipment. Provision has been added to specify thatthe operator may apply for a variance from run ticket requirements if individualcircumstances require. E.1.a. Numerous comments were received relating to failure to report theincident of theft or mishandling, the volume of oil or condensate involved,the abatement period, and the requirement that the incident report statewhether a theft was reported to company security. The proposed rulemakingprovided no standards by which to determine when a failure to report atheft would be considered knowing or willful conduct. Therefore, this portionof the paragraph relating to failure to report has been removed from thefinal rulemaking, leaving the Bureau to determine on a case-by-case basiswhether such failures are knowing or willful conduct within the meaningof the regulations in 43 CFR Subpart 3163. A provision has been substitutedthat provides for oral reporting with a written followup. The word ``estimated''has been inserted before volume in the fourth item as a practical amendment.The abatement periods have all been changed to 10 business days. However,the requirement that the incident report identify to whom the theft ormishandling has been reported has been retained. Depending on the natureof a particular theft, the Bureau may wish to confer with company securityor local law enforcement personnel investigating the incident. The suggestionthat thefts be reported directly to Indian tribes was not adopted. Thereporting of thefts to tribes can be accomplished through internal governmentalagreements. F.1.a. Several comments made suggestions concerning this paragraph. Mostof them questioned the need for self-inspection for the minimum site securityrequirements, opposed the monitoring of any such program by the Bureau,and stated that self-inspection should be at the option of the operator.The Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act required the Secretary toestablish minimum standards for site security plans which would be developedby operators. Self-inspection was determined to be a way in which operatorswould be able to protect oil and gas produced or stored on a lease site.The suggestious are not adopted and self-inspection with Bureau of LandManagement monitoring remains as part of the Order. G.1. Numerous comments recommended removing the requirement for showingthe time the activity took place; expressed confusion as to the severityof the violation in the event of noncompliance, and confusion as to themeaning of the corrective action to be taken and the abatement period:Or suggested removal of the entire paragraph. The requirement for showingthe time has been removed as unnecessary, because the time of removal isimmaterial to production accountability. The Order has been amended toprovide for only one level of violation, major, because of the effect ofnoncompliance on production accountability. Recordkeeping for self-inspectionactivities under this paragraph has been removed as unnecessary: As a practicalmatter, there can be no self-inspection without recordkeeping. The wordingfor corrective action has been changed to ``commence and maintain documentation'',because the proposed requirement that records be produced would be impossibleto comply with if there is no system of recordkeeping. Since the correctiveaction language has been changed, the abatement time is considered to bereasonable. ``Working day'' has been replaced by ``business day.'' Thesuggestion that this section be removed has not been adopted because itsprovisions are required by the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Actand by regulations. H.1. Several comments were received on this section. One comment suggestedremoval of this provision. Others suggested removing the word ``lessee''from the text because the lessee is not the responsible party unless heis also the operator, and excluding dry gas production facilities fromthis requirement because they do not include storage facilities. ``Lessee''has been removed from the text. Although a site facility diagram is notrequired for dry gas production facilities, there still is a need to monitorto assure that the measuring equipment meets the minimum requirements andthat no by-passes around the meter exist or are installed. The suggestionthat dry gas production facilities be excluded from the site security planrequirements is not adopted. I.1. Numerous comments were submitted on this provision. These commentssuggested removal of the word ``condensate'', change of the word ``actual''to ``relative'', removal of the word ``lessee'', and clarification of whatcompletion of a facility means. Some comments also expressed concern aboutchanges or modifications of the storage and sales facilities. It was alsosuggested that dry gas production facilities be excluded from this requirement.Two comments recommended that a provision be added that existing site securitydiagrams already submitted are considered approved and acceptable, butthat when new facilities are added or old ones modified after the effectivedate of this Order, they shall comply with the requirements of this sectionas to diagrams. Language has been added to exclude dry gas production facilities,because such facilities have no storage elements, and the word ``actual''has been replaced with ``relative'' because the diagrams are not requiredto be drawn to scale, the words ``of construction'' have been added immediatelyafter ``completion'', and ``working'' has been replaced by ``business''in the abatement period, all for clarity or for purposes of practicality.The term ``condensate'' has not been removed as suggested for the reasonspreviously discussed in the preamble. Site security diagrams cannot beapproved until they are inspected, but new diagrams will be required onlyif the existing ones are found inadequate. The comment recommending automaticacceptance and approval of diagrams previously submitted is rejected. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Federal Seals </ITAG>A new section has been added to include information about the current practiceof the Bureau of Land Management calling for the placement of Federal sealson any appropriate valve, sealing device, or LACT component not in compliancewith the minimum standards for sealing requirements. This section advisesthat Federal seals are placed on appropriate valves only when (1) the operatoris not present at the site to correct the noncompliance upon its discoveryby the authorized officer, or (2) the operator refuses or is unable tomake the necessary correction. Immediately upon attachment of the Federalseal, the authorized officer notifies the operator or lessee by telephoneand letter that it is in place and of the corrective measures that needto be taken before it may be removed and replaced. Placement of the Federalseal does not constitute abatement of the violation for failure to havea seal in place. Finally, the section notes that a card is attached tothe Federal seal, which advises that tampering with a Federal seal shallresult in an assessment of $250. No monetary penalty is associated withthe Federal seal itself other than this penalty for tampering with it.<ITAG tagnum="85">V. Variances from Minimum Standards </ITAG>One comment suggested that a provision be included to provide for oralapproval of variances with written confirmation to be provided not laterthan the fifth business day following oral approval, as is provided forin Onshore Order No. 2 drilling operations. There are good reasons to allowsuch oral approvals for variance in drilling operations, because certainconditions may create a situation demanding immediate change or varianceto the approved drilling plan, but those reasons are not applicable tothe site security requirements. The suggestion is not adopted. <ITAG tagnum="84">Attachments </ITAG>Two comments suggested that the attachments relating to site security diagramsand sealing of valves be clearly identified as being examples. AttachmentI has been identified as being provided solely as an example, and, as statedearlier, Attachment II has been removed. Editorial and grammatical corrections and changes have been made as necessary.The principal authors of this proposed rulemaking are John Duletsky ofthe Washington Office, Raymond Thompson of the New Mexico State Office,Ray Brubaker of the Montana State Office, Ron Fellows of the FarmingtonResource Area, New Mexico, David Little of the Vernal District Office,Utah, Gary Bauer of the Rock Springs District Office, Wyoming, and AllenSchweighart of the Worland District Office, Wyoming, assisted by the OrdersTask Group, the staff of the Division of Legislation and Regulatory Management,all of the Bureau of Land Management, and the Office of the Solicitor,Department of the Interior. It is hereby determined that this proposed rulemaking does not constitutea major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the humanenvironment, and that no detailed statement pursuant to section 102(2)(C)of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C))is required. The Department of the Interior has determined that this document is nota major rule under Executive Order 12291 and will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the RegulatoryFlexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>). The information collection requirement(s) contained in this rulemakinghave been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C.3501 <T3>et seq. </T3>and assigned clearance number 1004-0134. <ITAG tagnum="85">List of Subjects in 43 CFR Part 3160 </ITAG>Government contracts, Mineral royalties, Oil and gas exploration, Publiclands_mineral resources, Indian lands_mineral resources, Reporting andrecordkeeping requirements.

Authority This Order is established pursuant to the authority granted to the Secretaryof the Interior pursuant to various Federal and Indian mineral leasingstatutes and the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982. Thisauthority has been delegated to the Bureau of Land Management and is implementedby the onshore oil and gas operating regulations contained in 43 CFR Part3160. Section 3164.1 thereof specifically authorizes the Director, Bureauof Land Management, to issue Onshore Oil and Gas Orders when necessaryto implement and supplement the operating regulations and provides thatall such Orders shall be binding on the operators of Federal and restrictedIndian oil and gas leases which have been, or may hereafter be, issued.Specific authority for the provisions contained in this Order is foundat: andSection; 3162.4-1, <T3>Well records and reports; </T3>andSection; 3162.7-1, <T3>Disposition of Production; </T3>andSection; 3162.7-5, <T3>Site Security on Federal and Indian (except Osage) Oil and Gas Leases;</T3>and Subpart 3163 Noncompliance and Assessments. B. Purpose The purpose of this Order is to implement and supplement the regulationsin 43 CFR 3162.7-1 and 3162.7-5. This Order establishes the minimum standardsfor site security by providing a system for production accountability andcovers the use of seals, by-passes around meters, self-inspection, transporters'documentation, reporting of incidents of unauthorized removal or mishandlingof oil and condensate, facility diagrams, recordkeeping, and site securityplans. The Order identifies certain specific acts of noncompliance, rates themas to severity, establishes abatement periods for corrective action forsuch acts of noncompliance, and provides for variances. This Order servesas notice to any party cited for noncompliance that it may request fromthe authorized officer an extension of the abatement period for any violation,provided the request for extension is applied for and granted prior tothe expiration of the abatement period previously allowed. Additionally,this Order serves as notice to any party aggrieved by an enforcement actiontaken pursuant to this Order, of that party's rights, pursuant to 43 CFR3165.3, to administrative review, hearing on the record, and judicial review.C. Scope This Order is applicable to all Federal and Indian (except Osage) oil andgas leases. In addition, this Order is applicable to all wells and facilitieson State or privately-owned mineral lands committed to a unit or communitizationagreement that affects Federal or Indian interests, notwithstanding anyprovision of a unit or communitization agreement to the contrary. <ITAG tagnum="84">II.

Requirements</ITAG>A. Storage and Sales Facilities_Seals1. Minimum Standards.a. The primary purpose for use of seals is to provide a means of documentingthe removal of production for royalty purposes. Additionally, seals providea means of detecting unauthorized entry to, and removal of, production.The seal requirements are based on American Petroleum Institute (API) recommendedpractice No. 12 R1, 3rd Edition, dated May 31, 1986, entitled ``API RecommendedPractice for Setting, Connecting, Maintenance and Operation of Lease Tanks.''b. All lines entering or leaving all oil storage tanks shall have valvescapable of being effectively sealed during the production and sales operationsunless otherwise provided under the provisions of this Order. During theproduction phase, all valves that provide access to producton shall beeffectively sealed in the closed position. During the sales phase, andprior to taking the top gauge, all valves that would allow unmeasured productionto enter or leave the sales tank shall be effectively sealed in the closedposition. Any equipment needed for effective sealing, excluding the seals,shall be located at the site. If the sealing equipment is in the possessionof the operator's representative or at a centralized field location, itshall be considered to be at the site. (See Attachment I). Each ineffectivelysealed valve or appropriate valve not sealed shall be considered a separateviolation.c. Additionally, valves or combinations of valves and tankage that provideaccess to the production prior to measurement for sales or lease use purposesare considered appropriate valves and are subject to the seal requirementsof this Order (See Attachment I).d. Valves on any tank which contains oil or is connected to the productionequipment are considered appropriate valves and are subject to the sealrequirements contained in this Order, except those valves on tanks whichcontain oil that has been determined by the authorized officer to be wasteoil or valves on tanks used for the primary treatment of lease production(See Attachment I).e. Exclusions to seal requirements contained in this Order shall be limitedto the following:i. Valves on production vessels and tanks used as production vessels (e.g.,gunbarrels, wash tanks, etc.);ii. Valves on water tanks, provided the possibility of access does notexist through a common circulating, drain, or equalizer system to productionin the sales and storage tanks;iii. Sample cock valves utilizing piping of 1 inch of less in diameter;iv. When a single tank is used for collecting small volumes of condensateproduced from a gas well, the requirement is waived for requiring the fillline valve to be sealed during shipment; but all other seal requirementsof this Order shall apply;v. Gas line valves of 1 inch or less used as tank bottom ``roll'' linesneed not be sealed; provided there is no access to the contents of thestorage tank and said lines cannot be used as equalizer lines;vi. Tank heating systems which use a source of fluid other than the contentsof the storage tank, i.e., steam, water, glycol;vii. Valves, connected directly to the pump body, used on pump bleed offlines of 1 inch or less in diameter; andviii. Tank vent line valves.f. For systems where production may only be removed through the lease automaticcustody transfer (LACT) system, no sales or equalizer lines need to besealed. However, any valves which allow access for the removal of oil priorto its measurement through the LACT shall be effectively sealed (See AttachmentI).g. For oil measured and sold by tank gauging, all appropriate valves shallbe sealed during the production phase, and all valves that provide accessto production shall be effectively sealed in the closed position. Duringthe sales phase, and prior to taking the top gauge, all valves that wouldallow unmeasured production to enter or leave the sales tank shall be effectivelysealed in the closed position. Circulating lines having valves which mayallow access for the removal from storage and sales facilities to any othersource except through the treating equipment back to storage facilitiesshall be effectively sealed as near the storage facility as possible (SeeAttachment I).2.
