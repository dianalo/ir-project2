LOUIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   McDonnell Douglas Corp. said Swissair will purchase six more of its new MD-11 long-range jets and an additional MD-81 twin-engine airplane, in an order valued at more than $600 million.    The MD-11 orders are significant for the aircraft maker and defense contractor, which is competing with Airbus Industrie, a European consortium, to market a new generation of wide-body jets.    McDonnell's MD-11 program had a setback recently when Scandinavian Airlines System and Hong Kong-based Dragonair withdrew tentative orders for the aircraft, a derivative of DC-10.    Swissair already had six MD-11s on order, and still has options to acquire six more of the planes.    McDonnell will begin delivering the planes in 1990. Swissair said it will use the new three-engine jets, which can carry as many as 405 passengers, on several of its non-stop international flights.    A McDonnell spokesman said the company has received orders and options for a total of 93 MD-11s from 14 customers. </TEXT></DOC>
