Police said 66 people were killed and 200 wounded in thefighting, which pitted the divided army's Christian units againstthe Lebanese Forces, the main Christian militia in the nearly14-year-old civil war against the Moslems.   The army command and the Lebanese Forces said in separateannouncements that an agreement was reached for both sides to pullback at all confrontation points ``to facilitate movement of peopleand civilian traffic.''   But neither side said whether the withdrawals actually took place.   Fighters on both sides took advantage of the cease-fire startingWednesday evening to fortify front-line positions northeast of thecapital's Christian sector with sandbags and earthmounds, raisingfears that a new round of hostilities was imminent.   Police said regular troops and Lebanese Forces militiamen dueledintermittently with howitzers and machine guns in Beirut's ChristianEin Rummaneh district and the northern suburbs of Tabarja, Adma andAntelias.   The thud of exploding shells echoed across the capital, which hasbeen split into Moslem and Christian sectors since the outbreak ofthe civil war in 1975.   A military source said army commander Gen. Michel Aoun acceptedthe cease-fire on condition that the Lebanese Forces pull out fromeast Beirut streets and from government facilities they control.   The fighting has irrevocably shattered the unity of the Christiancamp. It has involved mostly Maronite Catholics, the 850,000-stronggroup that has dominated power since Lebanon's independence fromFrance in 1943.   Also Thursday, a U.S. Embassy official denied Christian radioreports that Ambassador John McCarthy has decided to evacuate theembassy's estimated 20 American staffers to Cyprus.   ``There are no plans for us to leave,'' the official said oncondition of anonymity.   He said a couple of shells crashed about 200 yards from the U.S.Embassy compound in the Aukur suburb of east Beirut, but that noneof the American employees was hurt.   Window glass of the compound housing the diplomatic and consularmissions was totally shattered, and both sections remained closedfor the second straight day, he said.   The police spokesman said Aoun's 20,000 troops have captured allmilitia positions in Lebanon's central mountain range but failed toblock militia supply lines.   Aoun's troops now control about 75 percent of the Christianenclave covering 310 square miles north and northeast of Beirut, thespokesman said.   But Lebanese Forces militiamen led by Samir Geagea still controlthe main urban centers along the enclave's 25-mile Mediterraneancoastline, he added. The enclave is home for 1 million Christians.   Aoun, who heads the Christian Cabinet in Lebanon's dualgovernment, has been staying at his command headquarters in Yarze,east of Beirut, since the fighting broke out.   The 53-year old general, who seeks to become Lebanon's nextpresident, was named head of a caretaker military cabinet byoutgoing President Amin Gemayel Sept. 22 after parliament failed toelect his successor.   In another development, an American woman was shot in the headand killed while driving her car in north Lebanon, one of herfriends said.   Gail Pascoe Harfoush, 38, a native of Washington, D.C., waskilled Wednesday afternoon as she drove her Mercedes-Benz fromTripoli to the village of Burj Akkar, 25 miles away, said herfriend, Marilyn Rashka.   Ms. Rashka, an American who lives in Beirut, said she heard aboutMrs. Harfoush's death from friends whom she declined to identify.She said Mrs. Harfoush was shot twice in the head and neck, and thatthe motive for the killing was unknown.</TEXT></DOC>
