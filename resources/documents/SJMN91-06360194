The legislativebody's final session is scheduled for Monday, after a meeting ofrepresentatives of the new Commonwealth of Independent States.  </CAPTION><DESCRIPT>  US; FOREIGN; RELATION; USSR  </DESCRIPT><LEADPARA>  The United States enters uncharted territory as it formally begins a new erawith a Western-looking but assertive Russia and the collection of smaller,potentially quarrelsome countries that made up the Soviet Union.;  Recognizing Russia as the successor state to the Soviet Union, the UnitedStates ends its relationship with a one-time communist giant that was itswartime ally, Cold War adversary and, in its death throes, a cooperativepartner.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  UNCERTAINTY MARKS U.S. TIES WITH EX-SOVIET STATESEXPERTS SEE DANGERS IN RUSSIAN RELATIONS WITHNEIGHBORS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     The greatest dangers ahead lie less in Russia's dealings with the world atlarge than in its relations with the newly independent states surrounding it,according to U.S. officials and analysts.;   &quot;They've got a lot of problems athome. They're not going to fiddle around in the world,&quot; one U.S. officialsaid.;   The United States is expected to recognize Russia on Thursday as thenew occupier of what was the Soviet Union's international role. It also plansto open diplomatic relations with five other key republics, but withhold tiesfrom others until they show progress in democracy, human rights, and borderarrangements.;   Russian President Boris Yeltsin pleasantly surprised skepticswhen he quickly smoothed relations with Ukraine and formed a commonwealth ofindependent states. But if conflict arises on its borders, Russia's leadersmay be tempted, as in the past, to settle matters by force. &quot;Historically,when there has been instability on its periphery, Russia has expanded andtaken control,&quot; one U.S. official said.;   &quot;Russian nationalism is a veryserious disease,&quot; said Marshall Goldman, director of the Russian studiescenter at Harvard and a professor at Wellesley College.;   So far, with mixedsuccess, the United States has held out the carrot of expanded Western aid andinvestment to republics that proceed democratically, adhere to human rights,respect borders and international obligations, and control and reduce theirnuclear forces.;   With Russia self-absorbed and desperate for Westernassistance, several U.S. officials voiced confidence that even with nuclearweapons and a U.N. Security Council veto it would continue the cooperationthat marked Soviet dealings with the United States under Mikhail Gorbachev andhis foreign minister, Eduard Shevardnadze.;   &quot;Economics will drive foreignpolicy,&quot; a senior administration official predicted.;   Russia and the otherrepublics are happy to be freeing themselves of the draining Third Worldentanglements that poked American nerves, Goldman said. And with the emergenceof independent states bordering the Middle East and Asia, there is less of arisk that Russian and American interests will clash.;   But, Goldman warned,the republics -- as newcomers to democracy in a vast former empire that hasnever enjoyed it -- should not automatically be counted in the democraticcamp. Leaders of Georgia and Azerbaijan, for example, have already shownauthoritarian tendencies.;   Secretary of State James Baker has voiced fearsof seeing the former Soviet Union deteriorate, as Yugoslavia has, into amultitude of warring factions -- with nuclear weapons.;   Senior Americanofficials have few illusions about the cohesive strength of the newcommonwealth. They may or may not have common defense arrangements, oneofficial said recently, but they will not have a common economic space.;   Andthe leaders do not seem to appreciate fully the difficulties ahead in changingtheir systems, he said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MARK MATTHEWS, Baltimore Sun  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911225  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  9A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  567  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, December 25, 199100360194,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
