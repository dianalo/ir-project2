With that prospect now unlikely, bond prices have fallen inrecent weeks. The price drop has brought a return of an invertedyield curve, or the situation where short-term bonds yield more thanlonger-term ones.   An inverted yield curve defies the logic that long-term investorsshould be compensated more than short-term ones because of thehigher risk in holding debt for a longer period of time.   A further weakening of bond prices has been caused by theTreasury, which has flooded the government bond market with new debtissues this month.   Signs that a recession was not imminent prompted a bond selloffearlier this month, putting even more downward pressure on prices.Bonds are considered a good investment when the economy is slumpingbecause their rate of return is constant.   But to confuse matters, bond prices rallied briefly this pastweek. When bond prices rise, yields fall. Market watchers attributedthe price rise to an auction of five-year Treasury issues Wednesdaythat drew greater-than-expected demand.   However, trading was thin Wednesday, leading some to speculatethat the rally reflected buying interest among a small group ofinvestors.   Market-watchers looking to the Fed's Federal Open MarketCommittee for lower interest rates may be disappointed.   The FOMC, which sets interest-rate policy, held itseight-times-a-year meeting last week, but, as is its practice, gaveno hint of any decision on its strategy.   Most experts expect the Fed to stay on its current course ofmoderating economic growth by holding interest rates steady. TheBush administration has been pressing for lower rates to stimulateeconomic growth, but the Fed appears more concerned withforestalling any resurgence in inflation.   ``A few weeks ago everyone assumed that the economy was slowingprecipitously,'' said William Veronda, senior vice president forfixed-income securities at the Denver investment firm FinancialPrograms Inc.   ``Unfortunately for that thesis it now appears that the economywas either, one, never as bad as it appeared to be or two, there'sbeen some slight reacceleration,'' he said.   The current bond slump curtailed a rally that sent Treasuryprices to two-year highs. The yield on the bellwether 30-yearTreasury bond fell from about 9.30 percent in late March to 7.84percent on Aug. 1. Since then, it has risen somewhat, and wastrading in the range of 8 percent to 8.25 percent last week.   Some market experts say that current economic conditions meanneither gloom nor doom for bond investors.   ``While recession may not be imminent, a rebound in economicactivity that could revitalize inflation appears remote,'' Moody'sInvestors Service Inc. said in a commentary last week. ``Most of themarket's recent setback reflects how too many investors had expectedtoo quick an easing of monetary policy.''   Some market-watchers advise bond investors to put their money inthe middle range of debt maturities, such as five-year Treasurynotes, striking a balance between the attraction of high yields onshort-term instruments and the possibility of capital gains onlong-term bonds.   Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., has advised customers to reducetheir long-term bond holdings as a percentage of their totalinvestments due to the belief that the Fed will not ease interestrates soon.   Smith Barney and other investment houses believe that long-termTreasuries will hold in the range of 8 percent to 8.50 percent incoming months. But, says Smith Barney, it now seems more likely thatthese bonds would yield more than this range rather than less in thenear term.   ``We continue to see the potential for still lower yields overthe intermediate to longer term on the assumption that the FederalReserve continues a policy of, on balance, restraint as long as theeconomy is operating near full resource utilization,'' theinvestment house said in a commentary.</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Monday Aug. 28</NOTE></DOC>
