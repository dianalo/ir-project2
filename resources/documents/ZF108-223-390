 IBM's AIX version 3 is a combination of the company's internalRisc architecture, some S/370 features and the same complex data managementarchitecture that is employed in the AS/400.andM;Historically, the features of both compute-intensive architecture and datamanagement architecture have evolved along different tracks.andP;  Theminicomputer, and more recently microprocessor-based PCs and workstations,have been primarily compute-intensive systems, designed for the execution ofapplications rather than the management of large data volumes.andM;The industry's premier data management solutions, however, have been systemssuch as IBM's S/370 hardware and MVS software, and the IBM architecture fordata management that originated in the early 1970s as Future Systems (FS) andwas later employed in the System/38 and AS/400.andM;During the 1980s, these two forms of compute-intensive and data managementarchitectures generated many disputes.andP;  Mainframes and machines such as theAS/400 have increasingly been outclassed on Mips (millions of instructionsper second) indicators, and the differential has become almost ludicrous inrecent years.andM;The latest generation of 32-bit microprocessors, such as the Intel 80486,benchmark in the 10+ Mips range--performance that is superior to mostminicomputers and competitive with smaller mainframes.andP;  Looking at IBM'slatest announcement, the gap becomes even more pronounced.andP;  A low-endworkstation delivers performance in Mips terms more than six times that ofIBM's largest AS/400 system.andM;The question is, however, whether compute-intensive indicators such as Mipsare really an adequate standard of comparison.andP;  IBM, with the rest of themainframe community in tow, has consistently argued that one must look atindicators such as data management (the ability to effectively handle largedatabases and physical storage volumes), bandwidth (the ability to move largevolumes of data around between CPUs and peripherals) and transactionperformance.andP;  On all of these indicators, the typical large mainframe systemperforms very well.andM;An interesting statistic in this context is that installed Mips in PCsexceeded installed Mips in mainframes nearly five years ago.andM;In 1989, the average installed PC mip translated into about 20Mb of storage;the average installed mainframe Mip corresponded to over 3.7Gb.andM;In practice, while the overall mix of processing power in most organizationshas migrated toward the desktop, data volumes have continued to growsignificantly around mainframe systems.andM;Data management is distinct from the concept of the database or databasemanagement system (DBMS) because it includes the full range of software andhardware facilities that are involved in managing physical storage, I/O andrelated functions which contribute to the efficient treatment of large datavolumes.andM;In a data management architecture, one is looking at a hardware and softwaresystem that is optimized specifically to support DBMS and the physicalstorage volumes and I/O that accompany them.andM;AIX version 3 has a very good claim to representing this type of datamanagement architecture.andP;  Virtual memory is heavily optimized, with 52-bitvirtual addressing of volumes that can theoretically extend to 1,000+terabytes.andP;  In addition, a &quot;hardware assist&quot; can be used as Database Memoryto increase performance of large databases in a virtual memory environment.andM;A new Logical Volumes feature permits the system to logically address, manageand replicate data volumes transparently to the physical disk on which theyare located (an improvement over the traditional Unix &quot;minidisk&quot; concept).andO;New dynamic linking and loading facilities in AIX version 3 optimize loadingand update of large, data-intensive programs.andM;The AS/400 object-oriented architecture is carried over into a newapplication as a vehicle for system administration (the various hardware andsoftware components of the system are described and managed as objects).andM;And embedded across the whole architecture is the capability of single-levelstorage, otherwise known as the ability to address all physical storage,whether resident in main memory, auxiliary or as disk storage.andM;The system's storage addressability is at least at the level of IBM's S/370Enterprise Systems Architecture (in the thousands of terabytes range) and,when coupled with the new SQL relational DBMS environment which IBM plans toimplement, the result will be more than a passing resemblance to an S/370MVS/ESA system running DB2.andM;A downsized version of AIX version 3 is also promised by IBM for the 80386and 80486 environment of the PS/2, and, in a much enhanced native modeversion of AIX/370, for the S/370 mainframe world.andM;While no one proposes that PS/2s will get addressability in the terabyterange, it is still worth noting that the hybrid of compute-intensive and datamanagement architecture embodied in AIX version 3 will extend across a wideand scalable range of platforms.andM;BONES OF CONTENTIONandM;The value of this approach can be disputed.andP;  IBM's preoccupation with suchissues as virtual memory and data management has already formed one of the&quot;bones of contention&quot; between the Open Software Foundation (which is carryingover these IBM concepts into its OSF/1 operating system) and UnixInternational, which has taken a number of potshots at all this virtualmemory.andM;The traditional design concepts of Unix system architecture, which arereflected in, for example, Berkeley Unix and System V.4, emphasizecompute-intensive performance, with the result that the operating system isgeared more to engineering/scientific than commercial systems parameters.andM;The approach adopted by IBM, and generally supported by OSF, is that thefuture of Unix will involve more data- and database-intensive requirements ofthe type currently addressed by mainframe systems.andP;  Both arguments containmerit because they may ultimately prove to be synergistic.andM;Certainly, it is not difficult to project that data management will become anincreasingly important parameter not only of Unix but of all operatingsystems and hardware in the 1990s.andM;Widespread use of graphical user interfaces (GUIs), compound documents,image-processing and multimedia technologies in the 1990s can be expected todrive up data volumes within the average large end-user organizationspectacularly in the 1990s.andP;  This will be especially true oncehigh-resolution color starts to come in on any scale.andM;By most estimates, a page of photographic-quality color translates intoaround 60Mb of data, and that kind of volume will inevitably require not onlypowerful databases but also new forms of hardware support.andM;In engineering and scientific applications, particularly in large CAD-CAM andmodeling programs, data volumes are also going to be increasingly heavy.andP;  Inmost large organizations, the 1980s installed base of PCs is inevitably goingto drive demand for ever larger and more sophisticated databases and datamanagement in the 1990s.andM;All of which suggests that however one feels about the merits or demerits ofAIX version 3, the IBM approach is worthy of closer attention.andM;We are, arguably, at a crossroads in the history of the computer industry.andO;During the 1990s, the evolution of complex instruction set computing (Cisc)and Risc technology is going to make processing power available more cheaply,and in greater quantity than ever before.andP;  Add to that the increasingprogress of VLSI technology, and it becomes possible to implement forms ofcomputer architecture that are not only quantitatively different (runningfaster, offering better price/performance and which can displace largermachines) but qualitatively different (they are optimized to perform databaseand data management tasks, as well as provide fast execution).andM;IBM's AIX version 3 and its Risc systems represent a promising start in thisdirection.andM;Jeffery is managing director of International Technology Group, Los Altos,Calif., a consulting firm that specializes in following IBM.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
