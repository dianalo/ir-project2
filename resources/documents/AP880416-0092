Khalil al-Wazir, caught reading PLO reports in his study, firedhis pistol once but was sprayed with about 170 bullets, saidofficials of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Tunis.   Abdallah Frangi, the PLO representative in Bonn, West Germany,blamed Israeli security agents for the attack.   ``Eight members of the Israeli secret service, armed withmachine pistols equipped with silencers, forced their way into thehouse and shot the bodyguards of Abu Jihad,'' said Frangi, usingal-Wazir's alias.   ``The Israelis have proven with this bloodbath that they have asecret service which is capable of every kind of murder. They havealso shown that they do not want peace with the Palestinians,'' hesaid.   PLO sources in Tunis and elsewhere said a second commando unitwas waiting outside while al-Wazir was killed. One PLO source inNicosia said ``a busload of people, we think 30 altogether'' wasinvolved in the operation.   It was not immediately clear how the commandos escaped.   Al-Wazir led the Palestinian armed forces, acting as deputymilitary commander behind Yasser Arafat. He was a member of the PLOexecutive committee and No. 2 man in Fatah, the largest branch ofthe PLO.   An Arab diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidal-Wazir ``was the prime mover behind the uprising against Israelin the West Bank and Gaza.''   Al-Wazir was among PLO leaders closest to Arafat and was widelyregarded as among the most moderate. A soft-spoken man, al-Wazirwas obeyed even by dissident officers who split from Fatah afterfeuding with co-founder Arafat.   Al-Wazir was the first of the three co-founders of Fatah to bekilled.   In Jerusalem, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Aviv Shir-on, saidhe had no information on al-Wazir's killing. Other Israeliofficials could not immediately be reached for comment on theJewish Sabbath.   A three-day general strike and mourning was declared byPalestinian activists in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and GazaStrip, where riots broke out.   Arab reports said more than 12 Palestinians were killed today inthe bloodiest day since anti-occupation riots began on Dec. 8.   Al-Wazir, 52, was killed about 1:15 a.m. (8:15 p.m. EDT) bycommandos who drove up to his house in Sidi Abu Saeed, fatally shota Tunisian bodyguard driver and burst inside, where they killedal-Wazir's two Palestinian bodyguards, the PLO spokesman said.   ``They then broke into Abu Jihad's study. Everything happenedwithin seconds,'' he said.   Al-Wazir's wife Imjihad, daughter Hannan, 14, and son Nidal, 2,were in the house, but were not hurt, PLO officials said.   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat was stunned by the assassination ofhis military commander but held meetings with Bahraini leaderstoday, aides reported in Manama.   Arafat was in Bahrain to map stategy for the occupiedterritories, where a Palestinian uprising has raged for four months.   An Arafat aide, who declined to give his name, said the news ofthe assassination made Arafat ``determined to reply to it bystepping up a thousandfold the uprising in the West Bank and Gaza.''   Arafat called al-Wazir's wife and told her ``our march is longand you have to be patient and surmount your pain so we can carryon with the mission he started,'' said the source, who was in theroom at the time.   Arafat could not be reached for comment. He has been touringPersian Gulf states for the last few days and today flew to Riyahd,the capital of Saudi Arabia, for talks with leaders there.Diplomatic sources had said he was not expected to fly directly toTunis for security reasons.   Al-Wazir was killed two months after three of his seniorofficers were assassinated in Limassol, Cyprus, as they arrangedthe charter of a ship to carry Palestinian deportees on a protestvoyage to Israel.   The Palestinians blamed the Israelis for the deaths.   In Cairo, an Egyptian official denounced the assassination as``a criminal act directed against the Palestinian leadership.'' Thebrief statement by the minister of state for foreign affairs,Butros Ghali, made no mention of the PLO charge that Israel wasresponsible.   The assassination was similar to one carried out in Beirut inApril 9, 1973, in which three Palestinian leaders were killed byIsraeli commandos who came in from the sea.   The victims were Mohamad Najjar, Kamal Nasser and Kamal Adwan.   Najjar, codenamed Abu Youssef, was the head of Fatah's militarybranch. Nasser was a member of the executive committee, and Adwanwas responsible for activities in Israeli-occupied territories.</TEXT></DOC>
