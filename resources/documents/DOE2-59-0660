Uranium, scandium, andthorium in the atmospheric particulates were determined by instrumentalneutron activation analysis (INAA). The concentration of uranium in theatmosphere surrounding the factory was as low as that in other environments.Significant correlations between the concentration of uranium and theconcentrations of scandium and thorium (derived from ground soil particles)were observed. Approximately 70 % of uranium in the atmosphere was foundin the coarse particles (andgt;2 {mu}m in diameter) using an Andersen high-volumesampler. Daily retention of uranium in the respiratory organs was estimatedto range from 1.1 to 1.5 ng per person. The calibration curve for uraniumby INAA was linear between 0 and 500 ng. The limit of determination ofuranium in the atmospheric particulates by this technique was 1.0 mgkg/sup-1/. It was concluded that the cellulose filter was suitable for determinationof uranium in atmospheric particulates by INAA because of its low blankvalue.</TEXT></DOC>
