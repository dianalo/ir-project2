The committee, in a 231-page report, concluded that Mr.Mobutu's security forces have maintained control and quashed&quot;any perceived threat to the president's authority&quot; through apolicy of political killings, torture, arbitrary arrests andharassment. The report said that security forces haveviolently suppressed student protests, killing at least 12students at the University of Lubumbashi in southeasternZaire last May.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Since President Mobutu took power in a military coup in1965, thousands of Zaireans have been killed, or subjected totorture, cruel treatment, or prolonged arbitrary detentions,&quot;the report charged. It said that Zaire's repressive policyhas &quot;lead to a total breakdown in the rule of law in Zaire.&quot;   The Zairean Embassy in Washington declined to comment. Mr.Mobutu, reportedly one of the world's richest men, is animportant U.S. ally and a recipient of substantial U.S. aid.   The lawyers' report comes as President Mobutu findshimself under increasing attack, both inside and outsideZaire, because of his alleged plundering of his country'swealth and serious human-rights abuses. On Capitol Hill, theHouse voted to prohibit direct aid to Zaire; Belgium,meanwhile, froze all assistance to its former colony toprotest the alleged Lubumbashi massacre. In addition, theWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund, concerned byMr. Mobutu's persistent misspending, aren't providing newloans to Zaire.   The lawyers' committee, formed in 1978, monitorshuman-rights conditions world-wide, according to Makau waMutua, who heads the committee's Africa Project andco-authored the Zaire report, titled &quot;Zaire: Repression asPolicy.&quot; The report was based on extensive research, Mr.Makau said, including interviews with eyewitnesses,government officials and opposition activists in Zaire.   Mr. Makau and his co-author, Peter Rosenblum, wereattacked on the street in Kinshasa, the capital, during theirsecond visit last March. The government, in an investigationof the incident, denied involvement, but acknowledged thatsome of the laywers' movements were monitored by securityforces.   The report charged that the long history of human-rightsabuses has been carried out by Zaire's four principalsecurity forces. It said that the security forces &quot;occupy aprivileged position&quot; and &quot;have unrestrained authority toarrest, abuse and detain the population in detention centers;these actions are effectively unreviewable by Zaire'scivilian judiciary.&quot;   The government, the report said, routinely arrests anddetains its critics incommunicado &quot;from several days toseveral months&quot; without placing charges against them.Moreover, the report said, &quot;Zaire's armed and security forceshave been involved in extrajudicial executions of students,peasants and opposition activists during 1989 and 1990.&quot;   It noted that last April President Mobutu announced withmuch fanfare that he was lifting a longtime ban on oppositionparties and preparing other political reforms. But within aweek, the report said, security forces, in an apparentlyunprovoked attack, disrupted an opposition political rally inKinshasa and killed at least three people.   The report also noted that the U.S. continues to providevital economic and military support to Zaire, despite massivecorruption and human-rights violations. It said that the U.S.shouldn't provide more funds to Zaire unless the governmentshows &quot;demonstrable progress&quot; on human rights.</TEXT></DOC>
