EPA insisted it made the decision solely because it consideredhealth gains to be marginal, and did not consider at all the hugecosts that such a standard would impose on the utility industry.   The agency estimated that 100,000 asthmatics live within 12miles of a coal-burning power plant and might be exposed for onehour per year to a burst of sulfur dioxide, and only about aquarter of those would show any reaction. It had no estimate of thenumber of people living near other potential sources such asindustrial boilers.   Craig Potter, assistant administrator for air programs, said theagency decided not to act because of the ``reversible, transitoryeffects'' involved for ``a fairly small number of individuals'' who``if sensitive to these kinds of exposures are likely sensitive toother kinds of exposures and have medication'' that would protectthem.   Nonetheless, the agency asked for public comment on whether itshould adopt a one-hour sulfur dioxide standard of 0.4 parts permillion.   Environmentalists denounced the decision, which MichaelMcCloskey, chairman of the Sierra Club, said ``starkly emphasizesthe Reagan administration's preference for protecting thepolluters' profits rather than public health.''   From industry, Joe Mullan, environmental specialist for theNational Coal Association, said, ``Medical people coming to us arefinding that there is adequate control under current standards.''   Outdoor concentration standards aimed at protecting health areby statute required to be set without considering costs.   Asked what criteria the agency was using to make what Potteradmitted was a ``tough call,'' Bruce Jordan of the Office of AirQuality Planning and Standards said a new standard would ``disruptan ongoing regulatory program'' and Potter said the agency had toconsider the best use of its own resources.   ``When you compare it (a short-term sulfur dioxide standard)with other problems, with ozone, there is no comparison,'' Pottersaid.   Potter said excessive ozone damages the lung structuresirreversibly, something sulfur dioxide does not do in briefexposures.   A one-hour standard of 0.4 ppm to 0.5 ppm would probably requirefossil-fueled utilities to reduce annual emissions of sulfurdioxide by 6 million tons, and a 0.2 ppm to 0.3 ppm standard wouldrequire reductions of 10 million tons to 11 million tons, Pottersaid.   The larger figure is roughly half the current national total andabout the reductions called for in some bills being considered byCongress to control the precursors of acid rain, of which sulfurdioxide is an important one.   The Edison Electric Institute has estimated that a 0.2 ppmone-hour standard would cost the industry $5 billion a year, but a0.8 ppm standard might be accommodated without major disruption.   The other sulfur dioxide standards are not expected to bechanged, the agency said in announcing that it would take commentfrom the public for 120 days before a formal decision.</TEXT></DOC>
