The committee met in executive session this morning, said ChristaMass, a spokeswoman for Sen. John Warner of Virginia, rankingRepublican on the committee.   Details of the meeting were not available.   The former Texas senator could expect to be treated with specialcourtesy by his former colleagues this afternoon in the historicSenate Caucus Room, site of the Watergate and Iran-Contra hearings.   But the 63-year-old Tower, who emerged as President Bush'snominee after an exhaustive background check, was certain to bequizzed on his consulting work for defense contractors and hisprivate life, as well as on defense policy and overall Pentagonfunding.   Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., a member of the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee, said Tuesday he expects the hearings to be marked by somecontroversy based on the reports that have already been raised inthe media.   ``There's enough out there,'' Dixon said.   Confirmation hearings are under way for two other Bush appointees:   _Commerce Secretary-designate Robert Mosbacher was warmlyreceived Tuesday before the Senate Commerce Committee. Lawmakerstold the Texas oilman he should make the government a moreaggressive advocate for American businesses in the worldmarketplace. His nomination is expected to win easy approval fromthe committee next week.   _Today marked the start of hearings on Samuel K. Skinner'sappointment as transportation secretary. In written responses toquestions from the Senate Commerce Committee, the 50-year-oldIllinois transportation administrator said foreign airlines servingthe United States should be forced to meet the same securityrequirements as U.S. carriers.   The Tower hearings are likely to focus in part on the issue ofoverall military spending. Former President Reagan asked in hisfinal budget for $315.2 billion for the Pentagon in fiscal 1990,which begins Oct. 1. The request represents a 2 percent increaseafter inflation.   But Bush, according to testimony last week from Office ofManagement and Budget nominee Richard Darman, is expected to reduceReagan's request by an unspecified amount.   If Bush fails to trim the request, Congress is likely to do so.In the past four years, Congress has cut military spending increasesto levels below the rate of inflation.   ``I think they're whistling Dixie if they think they'll get a 2to 3 percent increase in spending,'' said Rep. Sonny Montgomery,D-Miss., a member of the House Armed Services Committee. ``They'llbe fortunate if they get the inflation factor.''   Tower, a former chairman of the Armed Services Committee, alsowas certain to be quizzed about his connections to a number ofdefense contractors.   According to public records and associates, Tower's consultingfirm of Tower and Associates has been on annual retainer withMartin-Marietta, Textron, LTV Aerospace and Defense Co., RockwellInternational and British Aerospace.   Tower's firm also received about $100,000 a year under a contractfor consulting services to Hicks and Associates, a McLean, Va.-basedaerospace consulting firm headed by Donald Hicks, a formerundersecretary of defense.   A lengthy FBI background check of Tower pushed his personal lifeinto the forefront, including his bitter divorce and reports ofdrinking and womanizing.   Bush, in announcing the appointment of Tower, dismissed ``a lotof rumors that proved to be groundless,'' and said, ``I am totallysatisfied in that regard.''   Sens. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and Warner, ranking members of the SenateArmed Services Committee, said they would read the FBI reports onall nominees before the hearings.   Expected to raise the question of Tower's private life is PaulWeyrich, chairman of Coalitions for America, a conservative thinktank. Weyrich is scheduled to testify before the committee nextTuesday.   In an interview last week, Weyrich said he opposes the Towernomination because the former senator fails to meet the ethicalstandards Bush envisioned for his administration.</TEXT></DOC>
