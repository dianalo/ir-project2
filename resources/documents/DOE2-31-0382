Lower prices for coal, and in some casesrail, create obvious opportunities where new contracts may be signedat more favorable terms than in the recent past. In many cases both partiesto a coal supply agreement can benefit when existing contracts are renegotiated.Changing circumstances have also occasionally created litigation overthe terms of existing contracts.
