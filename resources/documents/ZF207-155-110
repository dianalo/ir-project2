 A 4-megabit/sec version has been demonstrated, 16megabits/sec is just around the corner and 100 megabits/sec is on the way.andM;Baseline standards for Safenet have been defined by the Naval Ocean SystemsCenter (NOSC), a San Diego laboratory that develops network topologies forships, submarines and aircraft.andM;Unisys Corp. built the initial Safenet I, a 4-megabit/sec LAN shown last yearin San Diego.andP;  Safenet is the forerunner of a series of networks that willinterconnect mission-critical shipboard computers and peripherals.andM;The Safenet project is part of the Navy's Next Generation Computer Resourcesprogram, which is reconfiguring shipboard weapons and systems that rely onlarge computers and communications.andM;Safenet I is enhanced for military survivability.andP;  It runs on the Navy'sstandard 16-bit AN/UYK-44 computers in an embedded, redundant token-ringusing the TMS380 adapter chip set developed by Texas Instruments Inc. jointlywith IBM Corp.andM;NOSC PCs use commercial-version TMS380 token-ring adapters that transfergraphic images of a Navy tactical environment.andM;Safenet I operates non-stop.andP;  Wiring faults can be induced on the media tosimulate operating conditions likely to occur in combat.andP;  The network can bereconfigured automatically by ring switching and wrapback as defined in theSafenet standard.andM;Original NOSC requirements specified that the LAN must not be proprietary andmust have wide commercial acceptance.andP;  The Safenet I approach promotescompatibility among different vendors' equipment.andM;NOSC considered an Ethernet configuration as well as a token-ring LAN, bothof which are covered by IEEE and ANSI standards.andM;Currently, 60 percent of all installed LANs are Ethernet types, compared with30 percent for token-ring.andP;  However, those percentages are expected to evenup in the next year.andM;In a token-ring, a single token circulates around the ring when all stationsare idle and no data is being transmitted.andP;  When a station has data totransmit, it must wait until it can seize the token -- an access-grantingmessage.andM;On receiving the token, the station transmits the data.andP;  A data framecirculates from node to node around the LAN, and when the frame passes thestation to which it is addressed, the data is copied to the station and sentto application software for processing.andM;The data frame then completes the circuit around the LAN, returning to itssending station.andP;  That station removes the data and releases a token tocontinue the token-passing process.andP;  Or it may transmit a new frame of data.andM;In a token-passing LAN, two stations cannot transmit data at the same time,so there is no way for data frames to collide as in Ethernet.andP;  To preventcollision, Ethernet uses the carrier-sense multiple access with collisiondetection (CSMA/CD) algorithm.andM;Under token-passing, there is a guaranteed worst-case time to transmit a dataframe.andP;  With CSMA/CD, the time to transmit a message is not predictable -- adrawback in real-time situations.andM;Token-passing access allows priority levels to be assigned to tokens, usefulfor time-critical and synchronous traffic.andP;  In fact, one of the NOSCrequirements for future Navy networks is that the media access control havethis deterministic feature.andM;First-generation token-rings have a data rate of 4 megabits/sec, comparedwith Ethernet's 10 megabits/sec.andP;  However, an IBM token-ring LAN is beingshipped commercially with a data rate of 16 megabits/sec to supporthigher-throughput nodes.andP;  This high-speed LAN will serve as a backbonenetwork to bridge together slower links.andM;On shipboard, the 16-megabit/sec LANs are configured redundantly with twocompletely separate rings.andP;  That distributed architecture is necessary forsurvivability and ensures measured degradation from equipment casualties andbattle damage.andM;The future 100-megabit/sec token-ring LAN will use fiber-optic media.andP;  FiberDistributed Data Interface technology will be smaller and higher thancopper-based LANs as well as electromagetically isolated for greatersecurity.andP;  NOSC requires that the selected LAN be adaptable for either wireor fiber-optic media.andM;One reason fiber optics will play a major role in future shipboard LANs isthat the copper cable now used in point-to-point communications makes up anincreasing portion of a ship's total weight.andM;On a modern warship loaded with computers and other electronic gear, thecommunications cable alone can weigh up to 85 tons, or 1 percent of theship's total weight.andP;  Replacing copper with fiber reduces this load up to 75percent.andM;A network in a naval enivornment must have a robust reconfiguration schemeand must be survivable through several levels of failure, according to NOSCrequirements.andM;When a &quot;hard&quot; error -- as opposed to a soft error, correctable by protocols-- is detected in a token-ring, the offending node disconnects, eithervoluntarily or by the forced actions of its neighbors.andM;The 16-megabit/sec token-ring LAN will carry the network managementarchitecture implemented in the 4-megabit/sec version.andP;  Built-in serviceswill support performance reporting, configuration monitoring and control,automatic network configuration and security.andM;Most of these management services are handled by the adapter chip set, whichhas self-test diagnostics to ensure that all adapters on the networkcooperate to isolate and recover from problems.andM;If the adapter chip set detects an error after inserting into the LAN, itimmediately de-inserts, allowing the network to continue reliable operation.andM;A soft error such as a corrupted or lost token is handled automatically.andM;Hard errors such as a wire fault or a faulty receiver or transmitted on theadapter card are isolated and resolved by the other adapters on the LAN.andO;Isolation and recovery occur independently of the host system.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
