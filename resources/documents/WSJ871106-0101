Last month's stock market crash and the recent slump in the high-yield, high-risk &quot;junk&quot; bond market already are taking their toll on buy-outs, as they are on takeovers.    &quot;There clearly is a slowdown in the leveraged buy-out business,&quot; says Kipp Koester, vice president of investments at Milwaukee-based Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co., which has invested in buy-outs. Adds another major player in the field: &quot;Everyone, from lenders on down, has been traumatized by the last few weeks.&quot;    And many specialists in the field expect the slowdown to continue. They add that even if the stock market bounces back to pre-crash levels, future buy-outs will be less speculative than those of the past.    &quot;We'll go to much saner times,&quot; says Theodore J. Forstmann, a partner in Forstmann Little andamp; Co., a New York-based buy-out firm. &quot;The number of deals in the future will be fewer and more carefully thought out,&quot; Mr. Forstmann adds.    In a leveraged buy-out, a company is taken private by an investment group usually consisting of its management, institutions and investment bankers. The group largely uses borrowed funds to buy out public shareholders. The debt is designed to be paid off through funds generated from the company's operations, the sale of its assets or a combination of the two.    Buy-outs of the future will be less leveraged and bankers will press buyers to put up more equity, specialists in the field say. Junk-bond financing, which fueled many of the largest buy-outs in recent years, may not be as plentiful, forcing buyers to pay more for borrowed money. While many buyers have relied on proceeds from asset sales to help make hefty debt payments, future buyers may have to repay borrowings almost exclusively from companies' cash flow because of the shrinking of the junk-bond market.    &quot;All of us in the merger business are having some trouble,&quot; says Erskine Bowles, a Charlotte, N.C., investment banker. Mr. Bowles says he is in the midst of transactions where potential buyers are trying to change the terms or reduce the price. Says Mr. Bowles: &quot;The buyers are perceiving more risk. One way to reduce the risk is to pay less.&quot;    And because of the danger of a recession, some highly leveraged companies' cash flow may not be adequate to service the debt. &quot;Prudent LBO buyers will be sensitive to the fact that there may be an economic recession,&quot; says Northwestern Mutual's Mr. Koester. Adds an investment banker: &quot;Every projection on leveraged buy-outs in the last three to five years had no recession factor built in.&quot;    &quot;We're back to what the leveraged buyout business originally was: Buying a company, paying down the debt in five years out of cash flow and selling it,&quot; says Leonard Green, a partner in Gibbons Green van Amerongen Ltd., a New York-based buy-out concern.    Some people in the business say that things got out of hand in recent years. Last year, leveraged buy-outs totaling $34.3 billion were completed, up from $32.6 billion in 1985. Through June of this year, buyouts amounting to $22.4 billion had been completed.    Companies taken private in recent years have been resold or taken public again at a dizzying pace. Garden City, N.Y.-based Avis Inc., for example, was sold to an employee stock ownership plan in September, just 14 months after the car-rental concern was acquired by a group led by Morristown, N.J.-based Wesray Capital Corp. Beatrice Cos., the Chicago-based food concern bought in a $6.2 billion leveraged buy-out by New York-based Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. last year, is now on the block again. And Chicago-based Budget Rent a Car Corp. went public in June, just eight months after Gibbons Green bought the company.    While the rapid-fire changes have often resulted in job cuts and lower employee morale, buy-outs often earned owners of leveraged companies returns on equity as high as 10-to-1.    Encouraged by the astronomical returns, dozens of new players came into the game, raising billions of dollars for &quot;blindpool&quot; funds. Organizers of these funds collect fees for managing the money and usually have sole discretion over which companies will be bought in highly leveraged transactions.    Kohlberg Kravis, considered the most successful of the buy-out arrangers, recently raised a new $5 billion fund from a group of institutional investors. New York-based Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. and Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. are currently completing new buy-out equity funds that will total more than $1 billion each.    The money already set aside for funds guarantees that leveraged buy-outs will continue. But it's unlikely that new fund-raisers will meet with success. &quot;Institutional investors in general will be a lot pickier about what they do and who they do it with,&quot; says Mr. Forstmann. He adds that first-time fund-raisers &quot;won't be able to get money.&quot;    Fewer funds in the future will result in a less competitive field -- and lower prices paid for companies being bought. Indeed, some investment bankers say that's already apparent. &quot;Since three weeks ago, the psychology changed,&quot; says one investment banker. &quot;You're lucky if you get one buyer for an asset.&quot;    Besides the depressed stock market, other factors are helping to guarantee that prices for future buy-outs will be lower than in the past. Many participants say that they believe the boom years are over and that they must be much more conservative in making projections for future buy-outs.    Moreover, some buyers are nervous about proposed tax-law changes that might significantly affect the business. One proposed provision would include a $5 million interest expense deduction limit on merger-related transactions, including leveraged buy-outs. That too, is likely to keep prices down, at least in the near-term, buy-out investors say.    And the traditional financing technique is likely to change. Many buy-outs have been financed, in part, by short-term &quot;bridge loans&quot; from investment banks. These loans were most often refinanced with junk bonds. But the market for new junk bonds recently has shrunk severely.    Buy-out specialists say that in the future, junk bonds could play a less important role. If the market doesn't rebound, buyers will turn more to insurance companies and other institutions for subordinated debt financing.    Such financing tends to be costlier than junk bonds. &quot;We'll be looking for returns of 20%,&quot; says Northwestern Mutual's Mr. Koester. Even in recent junk-bond transactions, interest rates were considerably beneath that level.    And since some institutions have become far more cautious in the current environment, Mr. Koester and others say that they won't finance buy-outs whose debt can't be repaid largely on the basis of a company's cash flow.    Until the junk-bond market stabilizes, &quot;The bust-up type of transaction (which depends on asset sales) looks like it will be a less important part of the landscape than in the past,&quot; agrees Barry Friedberg, head of investment banking at Merrill Lynch. But, he adds, uncertainties about the tax laws and prices buyers will get for assets they sell also makes these deals more difficult right now.    What all this adds up to is that leveraged buy-out investors aren't likely to again see the huge returns on their equity that they saw in the past. But many are still sanguine about the future.    &quot;People got spoiled,&quot; says Robert L. Zobel, director of investments for the state of Wisconsin, which invests in leveraged buy-out funds. &quot;So we won't get the 35% returns we are accustomed to. Maybe the returns will drop to only 25%. That's still outstanding.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
