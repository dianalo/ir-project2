The Commerce Department said the gain in the Index of LeadingEconomic Indicators followed no increase at all in June and a steep1.3 percent drop in May, the biggest decline since late 1987. Theindex had risen 0.6 percent in April.   The government initially reported a month ago that the index hadfallen in June as well, marking the fourth time in five months thatthe index had fallen.   At the time the June report came out, many analysts wereconvinced that the economy was on the verge of a recession. However,since that time a variety of government statistics have been revisedto show more strength than previously believed.   These revisions have sent economists scurrying to scrap their ownrecession forecasts in favor of predictions calling for the economyto experience a slowdown in the second half of the year but comenowhere close to toppling into a recession.   Bolstering that view, the government issued its first look atAugust economic activity on Friday with release of the unemploymentstatistics. That report showed the jobless rate held steady at 5.2percent in July while the number of jobs, after adjusting forstrikes, shot up by more than 200,000.   Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co., said that theleading indicators, the good employment report in August and astring of other government statistics in the past month showed that``not only is there no imminent recession, there isn't even aslowdown'' at the present time.   He predicted that overall economic growth, as measured by thegross national product, could advance at a rapid clip of between 3percent and 3.5 percent in the current July-September quarter.   That would be substantially faster than the 2.7 percent GNPgrowth rate from April through June. But Sinai predicted growthwould slow in the final three months of the year, reflecting anexpected dip in auto sales after the flurry of model-yearendingdiscount incentives offered in July and August.   Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm, said heexpected growth in the final half of the year would average 2.2percent. While that would be down a percentage point from thefirst-half growth rate, it would be enough to reach theadministration's goal of 2.9 percent growth for all of 1989.   ``We are going to have a fine year for the economy,'' Evans said.``Inflation started out badly, but it has calmed down, and now youwould have to look pretty hard to find something you didn't likeabout this year.''   Analysts believe that with inflationary pressures easing becauseof a moderate slowdown in growth, the Federal Reserve board has beenable to achieve the so-called soft-landing it was seeking.   In July, five of the 11 leading indicators showed strength, withthe biggest positive push coming from an increase in the growth ofthe nation's money supply.   Analysts said that reflected the fact that the central bank beganeasing credit conditions slightly in June and July, a developmentwhich has helped to push interest rates lower.   Other sources of strength in the July report were a jump inconsumer confidence, the rise in stock market prices during themonth, an increase in plant and equipment orders and an increase inthe backlog of unfilled manufacturing orders.   Five indicators held back the overall increase. The biggestnegative factor was a decline in raw materials prices. While lowerinflation is generally seen as good for the economy, the leadingindex considers it a drawback because it can signal falling demand.   Other negative factors were a drop in orders for consumer goods,an increase in weekly unemployment claims, a fall in buildingpermits and changes in business delivery times.   The 11th indicator, the length of the average workweek, showed nochange from June to July.   The overall index stood at 144.0 percent of its 1982 base of 100.</TEXT></DOC>
