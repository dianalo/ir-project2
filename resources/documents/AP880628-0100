(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The bankrupty trustee for PTL has writtento the ministry's ``lifetime partners,'' asking them whether theythink founder Jim Bakker should return to the ministry.   Bakker is objecting to the letter, which also warns the partnersthat their claims in bankruptcy court could endanger the survivalof the church.   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds is scheduled to considermodifications to the ministry's reorganization plan at a hearing inColumbia on Wednesday. PTL filed for bankruptcy reorganization ayear ago.   The plan calls for sale of much of the assets of the ministry,including the 2,300-acre Heritage Park USA complex in Fort Mill.PTL has been in financial straits since Bakker left amid asex-and-money scandal in March 1987.   In his letter, trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton Jr. asked thecontributors whether they felt Bakker should be allowed to returnand in what capacity. He also asked whether they would support PTLif Bakker were allowed to return.   Bakker, who has returned to the Fort Mill area and is seeking toregain control of PTL, responded to the questionnaire Mondaythrough his attorney.   ``Now, as PTL is facing liquidation, we request first, anopportunity to speak to the people and explain our side of thestory, on the PTL Club program,'' Bakker said in a statement. ``Wealso ask that we be permitted to lease time on the satellitenetwork for a separate television program to minister to the people.   ``Fundamental fairness requires that those who founded theministry have an opportunity to give account to the people before adecision is made,'' Bakker said.   There are about 114,000 PTL lifetime partners, who contribute$1,000 a year. They are entitled to free lodging at the HeritageUSA theme park hotel.   Benton told contributors that they could endanger the survivalof the ministry if they don't give up their claims to lodging.   ``If all PTL Lifetime Partners assert their claims individuallyagainst PTL and seek to collect payment, it could seriouslyhandicap the survival chances of the new PTL Ministry, which isbeing referred to as Heritage Ministries Inc.,'' Benton wrote.   Benton said the modified reorganization plan would allowlifetime partners to assign or donate their claim to HeritageMinistries. The survey asks if the partners would be willing togive up their claims ``in return for becoming a member (of HeritageMinistries) with full voting rights and privileges.''   Last December, former PTL trustee David Clark said 60 percent ofthe current and former PTL donors who responded to another mailquestionnaire said they would stop contributing if Bakker returnedas PTL leader. Only 14 percent said they would increase theirgiving, Clark said.</TEXT></DOC>
