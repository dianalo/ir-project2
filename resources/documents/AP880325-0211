Courting the Hispanic vote in the nation's largestSpanish-language media market, the Massachusetts governor said hefavored a one-year extension in the deadline for illegal aliens toapply for amnesty.   Asked in Spanish if a Dukakis ticket would consider a Hispanicas a vice-presidential running mate, he answered ``Tal vez(perhaps),'' adding: ``Vamos a ver (We'll see).''   Dukakis, who noted his own ethnic background as the son of Greekimmigrants, impressed some Spanish-speaking reporters with hiscommand of the language, although he spoke carefully and atranslation was sometimes requested.   Invited to a question-and-answer session were reporters, editorsand executives of Los Angeles' Spanish-language media: three dailynewspapers, two television stations and at least five radiostations.   In blasting the Reagan administration's Central Americanpolicies, Dukakis said Costa Rica's President Oscar Arias deservedmuch of the credit for the recent cease-fire agreement betweenNicaragua's Sandinista government and the U.S.-backed Contra rebels.   The Reagan administration's backing of the Contras and recentdispatch of U.S. troops to Honduras did nothing to contribute tothe peace process, Dukakis declared.   On the amnesty issue, Dukakis called for extending the May 4deadline by which illegal aliens must apply for temporary residentstatus another year.   But regardless of whether Congress extends the deadline, Dukakissaid that as president he would ensure that the immigrationbureaucracy does not break up families in cases where only somemembers qualify for amnesty.   The U.S. Immigration Reform Act offers resident status toillegal aliens who can prove they have lived continuously in theUnited States for the last five years.   It also sets stiff penalties for employers who knowingly hireillegal aliens.   Asked about the minimum wage, a perennial concern of minoritygroups, Dukakis called for an increase.   ``I don't see how you can support a family on $3.35 an hour,''the candidate said.</TEXT></DOC>
