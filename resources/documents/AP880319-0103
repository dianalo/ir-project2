The official, speaking on condition he not be identified, saidthe meetings were held Friday and ended inconclusively. He said heknew of no additional meetings being scheduled.   The official also said that he understood the Roman CatholicChurch, through a papal representative, was getting involved innegotiations concerning Noriega's future. He did not give anydetails.   CBS Radio quoted unidentified officials today as saying themeetings with Noriega went badly, with the Panamanian leaderinsisting that he wants to remain in the country after steppingdown. The report said the mid-level state department officials whomet with Noreiga were returning to Washington and officials do notbelieve Noriega's departure is imminent.   Another administration official said on Friday that the UnitedStates has decided not to seek Noriega's extradition if he fleesPanama to a third country.   That official, who also asked not to be identified, said thatDeputy Assistant Secretary of State William Walker had gone toPanama at Noriega's request to discuss the matter.   The official also said that two Panamanian pilots who worked forNoriega have defected to the United States. According to theofficial, the pilots said Noriega has been receiving arms from Cubaand money from Libya since the crisis broke out in that countrythree weeks ago.   Walker had instructions to bring Noriega the no-extraditionoffer in hopes that it would facilitate his departure, thus sparingthe country a period of prolonged political upheaval and widespreadsuffering.   The government of Spain has said it would be willing to admitNoriega provided he requests political asylum and the United Statesagrees not to seek his extradition.   On Feb. 5, two federal grand juries in Florida indicted Noriegaon charges of drug smuggling and money laundering. A U.S. treatywith Panama precludes the extradition of any Panamanian citizen tothe United States.   The political opposition in Panama has sought to get rid of thecountry's de facto leader for months.   The United States has been trying to encourage Noriega's ousterand stepped up the pressure against him after he deposed PresidentEric Arturo Delvalle on Feb. 25. Delvalle had tried to fireNoriega. The United States still recognizes Delvalle, althoughSolis Palma was installed Feb. 26.   The two pilots arrived in the United States on Thursday and weregiven permission to remain in this country by the U.S. ImmigrationService, the official said.   The pilots have told officials that Cuba has provided Noriegawith up to 16 tons of military equipment since the crisis in thatcountry erupted, the official said.   Cuba has emerged as a strong supporter of Noriega, consideringhim to be a victim of American interventionist activities.   According to the official, the pilots also said that Libya hasprovided Noriega with an undisclosed amount of money to enable thedefense chief to help Panama overcome its current cash crisis.   Panama has been virtually paralyzed economically for most of thepast two weeks. U.S. actions this month _ including blocking thetransfer of currency to Panama and withholding Panama Canal fees _effectively have cut off the flow of dollars to Panama and haveleft the country unable to meet much of its government payroll.   The official suggested that Cuban willingness to send weaponryto Noriega, including large numbers of AK-47 rifles, indicated thatthe strongman was willing to fight it out rather than go into exilepeacefully.   But Noriega's invitation to meet with Walker suggested that hemay be rethinking his position, the official said.   Initially, the Reagan administration had said that it was notinterested in any deal that would spare Noriega the consequences ofthe indictments handed down by the federal grand juries in Florida.   But the administration appears to have backed away from thatposition because of its interest in promoting a peaceful resolutionto Panama's crisis and in protecting the Panama Canal and otherU.S. interests in that country.   ABC News reported Friday night that unidentified U.S. andCentral American sources say Noriega has signed off on most partsof a package that will allow some face-saving for him, but will gethim out of office and out of Panama.   ABC reported that as a condition of Noriega's departure, he willnever go to jail and will be allowed to retain most of his wealth.   The deal, according to ABC, included that Noriega will step downwith full honors; several days or weeks later, he will leavePanama, going either to Spain or France. In addition, ABC said,opposition leaders in Panama have agreed not to seek criminalcharges against Noriega there and not to try to get any of hismoney held in overseas accounts.</TEXT></DOC>
