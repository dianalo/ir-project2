The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which spent the bulk of the session at lower levels, firmed in the final hour to close with a gain of 5.16 at 2039.30. The index had fallen in each of the previous five sessions and lost a total of about 100 points over that period.    Broader market averages moved higher as well, as Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.85 to 262.75 and the New York Stock Exchange composite index added 0.37 to 148.60. However, 828 issues declined in price on the Big Board, while only 666 advanced and 502 were unchanged.    Stocks held their ground in early trading, but staged a gradual retreat to session lows as major banks raised their prime interest rate to 10% from 9 1/2%. By early afternoon, the Dow Jones industrials had dropped nearly 12 points, and stocks drifted at lower levels until the late recovery pushed prices into positive territory.    Although traders said the prime rate boost wasn't much of a surprise, since it was in line with the half-point rise Tuesday in the Federal Reserve's discount rate, they said the market is still uncertain about the prospects for interest rates, the economy and stock prices.    &quot;There's nervousness both ways -- nervousness about higher interest rates and nervousness about being out of the market in case stocks rise,&quot; said Jerome M. Hinkle, a block trader at Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co.    Trading activity was fairly lackluster, aside from another round of dividend-related activity in select issues. Volume on the Big Board was 173 million shares, down from 201 million Wednesday.    David Holt, director of technical research at Morgan, Olmstead, Kennedy andamp; Gardner, in Los Angeles, said the primary barrier facing the market as it attempts to rally is the lack of motivation on the part of most investors to buy stocks at current levels.    &quot;It isn't like everyone is bailing out of the market, like where we were last October. The sellers have pretty well sold, the buyers have pretty well bought, and neither one is willing to change that balance,&quot; he said.    As a result, Mr. Holt said, the market is likely to continue &quot;drifting down of its own weight&quot; once the latest rebound has run its course and buying interest wanes. &quot;There's not a lot of screaming bargains out there,&quot; he said.    That could translate into a loss of another 100 points on the Dow Jones average over the next two weeks before the market can manage to turn around and move higher, he said. &quot;We would then have a nice platform from which a nice rally could develop, although it's almost getting too late for a summer rally.&quot;    Large banking companies, which have been hurt in recent sessions by rising interest rates, were mixed to lower as they adopted a higher prime rate. Citicorp lost 3/8 to 24 1/8, Chase Manhattan eased 3/4 to 28 7/8, J.P. Morgan dropped 1/2 to 35, Bankers Trust New York slid 5/8 to 36 5/8, Manufacturers Hanover was unchanged at 29 and Chemical Banking rose 1/8 to 32.    McGraw-Hill surged 4 1/2 to 68 amid speculation that a restructuring is in the works. There were rumors circulating inside the company that it would spin off all its operations except Business Week magazine, while others said the restructuring might involve a spin-off of its Standard andamp; Poor's unit, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. The company declined comment.    Royal Dutch Petroleum, co-owner of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group, lost 1 1/8 to 110 7/8 in active trading. The group reported that its profit rose 5% in the second quarter from a year ago on a current-cost basis, under which oil inventories are valued at the current market price, but went down 4% after inventory gains and losses were included. The group's other co-owner, Shell Transport andamp; Trading, dipped 5/8 to 70 5/8.    British Petroleum, which recorded a 24% second-quarter earnings gain on a current-cost basis, went up 1 5/8 to 53 3/8. After inventory adjustments, BP's profit was 13% higher than the year-ago level.    Federal National Mortgage Association, the newest member of the Sandamp;P 500, fell 1/4 to 48 on Big Board composite volume of 3.5 million shares. The stock was added to the list to replace Fort Howard, which is going private in a leveraged buy-out.    Environmental Systems jumped 2 5/8 to 11 5/8. The company said it is considering the possible sale of all or part of its operations and a recapitalization, among other things, in order to maximize shareholder value.    Scientific-Atlanta, which reported lower sales and earnings for the fourth quarter ended July 1, plunged 1 3/4 to 11 7/8. The company's net income dropped to 34 cents a share from 38 cents a year ago, while sales fell to $127.8 million from $140.6 million.    Northwestern Steel andamp; Wire added 7/8 to 24 5/8. The company's shareholders approved a buy-out offer of cash and notes valued at $25 a share from a group including members of its senior management.    The American Stock Exchange index rose 0.17 to 296.74. Volume was more than 10.7 million shares, down from Wednesday's volume of 13 million.    Technical Tape jumped 1 1/2 to 15 1/2, after Beiersdorf AG offered to acquire the company at $16 a share. The offer was made with the condition that Technical Tape end its merger agreement with Dainippon Ink andamp; Chemicals, which began a $13.75-a-share tender offer for the company on July 28.    Geothermal Resources fell 2 1/8 to 4. The debt-plagued company deferred dividend payments on two series of its preferred stock. It also said it expects to delay the mid-August interest payment on its 13% subordinated notes and may delay the Sept. 1 interest payment on its 13 3/4% subordinated notes. </TEXT></DOC>
