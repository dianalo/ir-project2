The suit, filed by the Atlanta Legal Aid Society, chargesthat the highly profitable Fleet Finance unit of NewEngland's largest bank bought high-rate home-improvementloans from brokers who had obtained the loans through fraudand deception. The suit alleges that Fleet was extensivelyinvolved with two smaller finance firms that in turn engagedhome-improvement contractors to solicit second-mortgagecontracts. These contracts would then be assigned to Fleet.</LP><TEXT>   A spokesman for Fleet, Providence, R.I., said theallegations against Fleet were without merit. He declinedcomment on the charges against the smaller firms, saying theywere independent companies.   Charges of fraud in the sale of home-improvement loanshave led to scores of lawsuits in cities across the nation.And increasingly, law enforcement officials are questioningthe ties between banks and high-rate lenders, as alleged inthe Fleet suit. In Massachusetts, Attorney General ScottHarshbarger -- who has sued a number of home mortgage firmsalleging unfair and deceptive practices -- said this week heis expanding an investigation to include the relationshipsbetween some mainstream banks and high-rate mortgage lenders.U.S. Attorney Wayne Budd has said he also has such an inquiryunder way.   The Atlanta suit was brought on behalf of Annie Collier,80 years old, of Atlanta, who was unable to pay a $6,900mortgage at 19% interest. It seeks class-action status,meaning that any judgment could apply to other plaintiffs inthe same situation, and was filed under federaltruth-in-lending laws and the RICO, or Racketeer Influencedand Corrupt Organizations Act, which carries stiff financialpenalties.   The suit alleges Fleet or its agents &quot;target thoseindividuals like Mrs. Collier who are black, elderly, infirmor who can easily be persuaded into unconscionable,unreasonable and oppressive loans.&quot; It seeks restitution forMrs. Collier and the plaintiff class and unspecified trebledamages under the RICO statute.   William Brennan, a Legal Aid lawyer, said in an interviewbefore the suit was filed that it could ultimately include asmany as 1,000 Georgia homeowners.   Separately, banking regulators in Massachusetts this weekissued rules meant to rein in the state's largely unregulatedsecond-mortgage industry. The rules require mortgage firms toregister with authorities, submit to periodic audits, keeprecords and be bonded.</TEXT></DOC>
