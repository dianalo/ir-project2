Justice Ministry officials said prison terms of 92 otherpolitical prisoners were reduced and 61 radical students wereremoved from police wanted lists.   The government ordered the amnesty involving 2,015 of what itcalled ``politically motivated offenders'' as part of efforts todefuse a nationwide furor over demands that former President ChunDoo-hwan be punished for human rights abuses and corruption underhis authoritarian regime.   Roh appealed to the nation last month to forgive Chun andpromised to free political prisoners as part of a series of measuresto wipe out vestiges of Chun's government. Roh, a former general andally of Chun, has pledged to introduce full democracy.   Dissident groups accused Roh of betraying his promise to free allpolitical prisoners and claimed about 300 remained in jail.   Justice officials said 224 ``anti-state criminals'' still werebehind bars, but said nearly all were Communist North Korean spiesor dissidents convicted of violent crimes.   The main political opposition parties welcomed the amnesty. Theyhad frequently demanded such action as a way toward nationalreconciliation and democracy, but said they would still press foraction against Chun.   Among those released Wednesday were Kim Hyun-jang and MoonBoo-shik. Each was serving a 20-year term for leading a raid on theU.S. cultural center in Pusan. One person died and three were hurtwhen the center was set afire in the protest over U.S. support forthe Chun government.   Kim Tae-kun, a leading dissident who won the Robert Kennedy HumanRights Award this year, had his civil rights restored. Kim, who wasreleased last June, drew five years in 1986 on charges ofoverthrowing the government and spreading pro-North Koreanpropaganda.   Kim claims he was forced to make a false confession under torture.   Justice Ministry officials said the amnesty was the second sinceRoh succeeded Chun last Feb. 25 and involved the largest number ofpolitical offenders in a single amnesty.</TEXT></DOC>
