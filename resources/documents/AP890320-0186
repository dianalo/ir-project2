But Alexia Morrison also concluded there was a lack of evidencethat the subject of her criminal investigation, former AssistantAttorney General Theodore B. Olson, was part of any conspiracy towithhold documents in the matter.   Olson made ``misleading and disingenuous'' statements during aMarch 10, 1983, appearance before a House subcommittee, but there isinsufficient evidence that he ``knowingly testified falsely,''Morrison concluded in a 225-page report.   Olson's answers were not ``overly helpful,'' but ``it clearlycannot be said in our view that the testimony actually obstructedthe committee's inquiry.''   Morrison had announced last Aug. 26 that she would not seek anindictment aganst Olson.   Her report, detailing the reasons, was released by a specialcourt that appointed Ms. Morrison independent counsel to investigateallegations that Olso gave false testimony to obstruct the inquiryof the House Judiciary monopolies subcommittee.   The panel was investigating allegations that the JusticeDepartment concocted an ``executive privilege'' claim to preventCongress from obtaining Environmental Protection Agency documentsconcerning possible misconduct by Superfund officials.   The confrontation between Congress and the executive branchhelped bring the ouster of EPA administrator Anne M. Burford andother top officials, including Superfund director Rita Lavelle.   Lavelle was later convicted of lying to Congress about conflictsof interest in her management of the EPA's Superfund program.   Morrison, who unsuccessfully sought to broaden her investigationto consider conspiracy charges against two other former top JusticeDepartment officials, suggested in her report that there was a basisfor suspecting a concerted effort to thwart the subcommittee'sinquiry.   ``The principal act which arguable had the purpose or the effectof obstructing that inquiry was the failure to disclose to thecommittee the existence of documents which the department hadwithheld from its production to the committee,'' Morrison said. ``Wecould find no evidence linking Mr. Olson to that failure.''   Morrison noted that then-Deputy Attorney General Edward C.Schmults withheld handwritten notes of department officials from thedocuments turned over to the subcommittee.   Carol E. Dinkins, then assistant attorney general in charge ofthe lands and natural resources division, also withheld a draftchronology of the executive privilege dispute compiled within thedepartment.   The subcomittee was not told that these documents were beingwithheld and was led to believe that virtually everything covered byits request was turned over, Morrison said.   ``The concealment of the notes and chronology arguablyobstructed, and certainly substantially delayed, the successfulcompletion of the committee's inquiry,'' Morrison said.   ``And there were enough people involved in this course of conductto give rise to the question whether they acted in concert toobstruct the committee's inquiry.''   For this reason, Morrison said that in late 1986, she askedthen-Attorney General Edwin Meese III to expand her jurisdiction topursue conspiracy allegations against Schmults and Dinkins.   On the advice of the Criminal Division, Meese refused to expandMorrison's mandate and opposed her request to the special court forpermission to broaden the investigation. The special division of theU.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled that it couldn't overruleMeese but said Morrison could investigate whether Olson participatedin a conspiracy.   In her report, Morrison said, ``The withheld materials wereplainly within the compass of ... (the panel's) request, and theycontained information critical to any assessment of the department'srole in the EPA documents controversy.''   Even though there may have been a valid basis for withholding thematerial, ``there could not be in our view any justification for thefailure to inform the committee of the existence of the withhelddocuments,'' Morrison said.   In a statement attached to the report, Schmults, now generalcounsel of GTE Corp., in Stamford, Conn., pointed to a 1986 JusticeDepartment memo concluding that ``there are no reasonable grounds tobelieve that further investigation or prosecution is warranted''with regard to him.   Olson's attorneys, in another statement, said he was ``unaware ofany evidence suggesting the existence of a Department of Justiceconspiracy to obstruct the House Judiciary review process; indeed,he views the very concept of a possible conspiracy as preposterous.''   ``The totality of this evidence demonstrates conclusively thatMr. Olson's conduct throughout the Judiciary Committee process waswholly inconsistent with the notion that he participated in a schemeto obstruct Congress by secretly withholding documentarymaterials,'' Olson's attorneys said.</TEXT></DOC>
