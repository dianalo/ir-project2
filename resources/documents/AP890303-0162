While President Bush is pinning his budget and deficit-reductionsplans on optimistic assumptions for a 3.2 percent rate of economicgrowth during 1989, many private forecasters expect the pace to becloser to 2.7 percent.   The gross national product, the broadest measure of economichealth, grew a robust 3.8 percent during 1988, but the pace fell to2 percent in the final three months of the year.   Most economists said 1989 opened on a strong note but that growthshould slow as the economy responds to a yearlong campaign by theFederal Reserve Board to push up interest rates and cool the economyto restrain inflation.   The government's main forecasting gauge of future economicactivity, the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, was expected toshow an increase for January. The report was scheduled to bereleased today.   ``Growth will be very robust this quarter, but starting nextquarter, I fully expect to see the effects of the higher interestrates,'' said Michael Evans, head of a Washington consulting firm.   William Dunkelberg, dean of the School of Business and Managementat Temple University, said economic reports so far this year give``no indication that the economy is going to weaken substantially inthe next half-year.''   The Fed last week intensified its anti-inflation fight, boostingits key bank lending rate a half-percentage point to 7 percent, inan effort to rein in accelerating inflation. At the same time, majorbanks boosted their prime rate, charged to their most creditworthycommercial customers, by a half-point to 11 percent, the secondincrease in two weeks.   The Fed's latest round of credit-tightening came as concernsabout inflation had heightened with word that consumer prices rose0.6 percent in January and wholesale prices rose 1 percent.   Today's release of the leading index marks its first issue in arevised format.   The revisions dropped two of 11 components from the index,revised two others, and added two new indicators of economicactivity.   Using data stretching back to 1948, the composite index hascorrectly predicted all eight recessions by dropping for at leastthree months in a row, but it also forecast four recessions thatnever materialized.   Larry Moran, a spokesman for the government's Bureau of EconomicAnalysis, said Thursday the changes make the index less prone toafter-the-fact revision, less apt to make false predictions offuture downturns and more precise at predicting when downturns willoccur.   A bureau study of how the new index would have done if it hadbeen used in the past showed that its performance would have beensimilar to that of the old index.   The two new indicators are a University of Michigan survey ofconsumer optimism and the measure evaluating manufacturers' unfilledorders.   The components that were dropped _ changes in outstanding creditand the change in inventories on hand and on order _ were scrappedmainly because up-to-date data has not been available when the indexfirst was compiled for a particular month. The index for that monthwas later revised to include the updated information.</TEXT></DOC>
