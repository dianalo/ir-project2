Debate -- Police Are Also Victims&quot;: By some incredible,convoluted sense of logic, Mr. Kando attempts to relate agang assault more commonly associated with street thugs to an&quot;unwillingness to control criminals.&quot;   He takes this wild rationale furthest when he suggeststhat policemen's ability to apprehend serious criminals isinhibited by restrictions on interrogation of people stopped,say, for some minor traffic offense: questions about wherethose people are from, how long they've been in a particularlocale, where they live and work, etc. Perhaps Mr. Kandowould prefer we fashion our police systems along those of theayatollah, Saddam Hussein or Joseph Stalin. In any case, whatdoes all this have to do with the LAPD assault case?</LP><TEXT>   I am a conservative when it comes to law and order, andbelieve those who commit crimes should be punished. If thecriminals are police, then they must be punished no less. I,like most Americans, am tired of hearing excuses forcriminals, whether the unending excuses by liberals forstreet crime committed by the &quot;socioeconomicallydisadvantaged&quot; or massive fraud by Sandamp;L executives -- orassault by police disguised as law and order.   Mr. Kando begins his article with Nietzsche's statementthat &quot;the gravest threat to a society's survival is itsunwillingness to control its criminals.&quot; I agree. However, inthe case of the LAPD assault, the police officers seem to bethe criminals who need controlling.   James T. Johnson   New Orleans</TEXT></DOC>
