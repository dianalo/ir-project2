These amendments would conform the regulations to section 301(d)(3)of the Tax Reform Act of 1976 (Pub. L. 94-455, 90 Stat. 1553) and are issuedunder the authority contained in sections 58(h) and 7805 of the Code (90Stat. 1553 and 68A Stat. 917; 26 U.S.C. 58(h), 7805). These temporary regulations are applicable for purposes of determiningminimum tax liability imposed by section 56 of the Code for taxable yearsbeginning before January 1, 1987. Except as otherwise provided, the temporaryregulations do not apply for purposes of determining alternative minimumtax liability imposed by section 55. <ITAG tagnum="84">Explanation of Provisions </ITAG>In General For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1976, and before January1, 1987, section 56 of the Code imposes a 15-percent minimum tax on a corporatetaxpayer's tax preference items, as defined in section 57, to the extentthat such preference items exceed the greater of (i) $10,000, or (ii) thetaxpayer's regular tax liability computed without regard to taxes imposedby sections 531 and 541 and after reduction by credits. This minimum taxis imposed in addition to other taxes imposed by chapter 1 of the Code.Section 58(h) provides that the Secretary shall prescribe regulations underwhich items of tax preference shall be properly adjusted where the taxtreatment giving rise to such items will not result in the reduction oftax under subtitle A of the Code for any taxable years. Application of the Tax Benefit Rule Section 1.58-9T(a) of the temporary regulations provides that under section58(h) of the Code taxpayers are not liable for the minimum tax imposedby section 56 on tax preference items from which no current tax benefitis derived because available credits would have reduced or eliminated thetaxpayer's regular tax liability if preference items had not been allowedin computing taxable income. These regulations follow the holding in <T3>First Chicago Corp. </T3>v. <T3>Commissioner, </T3>88 T.C. 663 (1987), <T3>aff'd, </T3>842 F.2d 180 (7th Cir. 1988). In <T3>First Chicago </T3>the court held that under section 58(h) the taxpayerowed no minimum tax on items of tax preference that did not produce a currenttax benefit because available credits would have eliminated tax liabilityeven if the preference items had not been allowed. The court recognizedthat the effect of the tax preference items was to ``free up'' for possibleuse in subsequent years additional credits that otherwise would have beenused to reduce tax liability. Section 1.58-9T(a) of the temporary regulationsfurther provides that any credits that, because of such preference items,are not needed for use against regular tax (``freed-up credits''), arerequired to be reduced under the rules of andSection;1.58-9T(c) of the temporaryregulations. Adjustment to Credits Section 1.58-9T(c) of the temporary regulations provides that a taxpayer'sfreed-up credits must be reduced by the additional minimum tax that wouldhave been imposed if a current tax benefit had been derived from preferenceitems that did not actually produce a current tax benefit. The amount ofthis reduction shall be calculated in the following manner_ (i) Determine the amount of freed-up credits, (ii) Determine the amount of tax preference items (if any) for which acurrent tax benefit was derived for the taxable year (``beneficial preferences''),and the amount of preferences for which no current tax benefit was derivedfor the taxable year (``non-beneficial preferences''), and (iii) Determine the portion of the total minimum tax on all tax preferenceitems for the taxable year that is attributable to the non-beneficial preferences.The freed-up credits are then reduced by an amount equal to such portionof the minimum tax. The regulations include rules necessary to allocate properly the requiredcredit reduction among credits that are of more than one type (<T3>e.g., </T3>investment tax credits and foreign tax credits) or thatwere earned in more than one taxable year. These rules take into accountthe order in which such credits would have been applied to offset the additionaltax that would have been imposed if preferences had not been allowed, percentagelimitations that would have affected the use of such credits against thisadditional tax, and the marginal rates at which this additional tax wouldhave been imposed. <ITAG tagnum="81">Determination of Freed-up Credit </ITAG>Section 1.58-9T(c)(2)(i) of the temporary regulations provides that todetermine the freed-up credits for the taxable year, the first step isto determine the regular tax that would have been imposed if preferenceitems had not been allowed in computing taxable income (``non-preferenceregular tax''). The second step is to compute the amount of credits thatwould have been allowed to reduce the non-preference regular tax. The thirdstep is to subtract the amount of credits that were actually allowed toreduce the regular tax for such taxable year from the amount of creditsthat would have been allowed to reduce non-preference regular tax. Theresult is the amount of the freed-up credits. <ITAG tagnum="81">Determination of Beneficial and Non-beneficial Preferences </ITAG>Section 1.58-9T(c)(3) of the temporary regulations provides the methodfor determining the amount of tax preferences from which a current taxbenefit is derived (``beneficial preferences'') and the amount from whichno current tax benefit is derived (``non-beneficial preferences'') forthe taxable year. If the taxpayer's tax liability (after credits) wouldbe the same regardless of whether preference items were allowed to reducetaxable income, then all of the taxpayer's preference items are non-beneficialpreference items. If tax liability (after credits) is less because preference items are allowedto reduce taxable income, then some of these preference items have provideda current tax benefit. In such cases, the non-beneficial preferences aredetermined by converting the freed-up credits for such taxable year intoan amount of taxable income. To make this conversion, freed-up creditsare ``grossed up'' (<T3>i.e., </T3>divided by the regular tax marginal rate at which such creditswould have offset non-preference regular tax) to determine the amount oftax preferences that freed up such credits. The aggregate of these grossed-upamounts is the total amount of non-beneficial preferences for the taxableyear. The freed-up credits are to be grossed up beginning at the lowest marginaltax rate that would have applied to the additional taxable income arisingif tax preferences were not allowed. Thus, the marginal tax rates at whichthe actual regular tax was imposed shall not be taken into account in grossingup freed-up credit, even if all or a portion of such tax is not offsetby credits because of limitations on the allowance of such credits (suchas the section 904 limit on foreign tax credits or the section 38(c) limiton investment tax credits). For example, if the first dollar of additionalnon-preference taxable income would have been taxed at a rate of 46 percent,even if regular tax imposed on taxable income at a 40-percent rate wasnot offset by credits because of the limitations on investment tax creditsunder section 38(c). The amount of beneficial preferences for the taxable year is computed bysubtracting the non-beneficial preferences for the taxable year from thetotal amount of tax preferences for such year. <ITAG tagnum="81">Determination of the Credit Reduction Amount </ITAG>Section 1.58-9T(c)(4) of the temporary regulations provides the methodfor determining the amount of minimum tax attributable to the non-beneficialpreferences. This amount is also referred to as the credit reduction amount.The credit reduction amount is determined by computing the amount of minimumtax that would be imposed on all tax preference items for the taxable yearif all such preferences had produced a current tax benefit. The minimumtax that is imposed on only beneficial preferences is subtracted from thisamount. The result is the minimum tax attributable to the non-beneficialpreferences for the taxable year. <ITAG tagnum="81">Reduction of Freed-up Credits </ITAG>Section 1.58-9T(c)(5)(i) of the temporary regulations provides that thefreed-up credits are reduced by an amount equal to the minimum tax attributableto the non-beneficial preferences (``credit reduction amount''). If thetaxpayer only has one type of freed-up credit (<T3>i.e., </T3>only investment tax credit or only foreign tax credit) andthat credit was earned in only one year (the current year or a carrybackor carryforward year), then such credit is reduced by the credit reductionamount. However, if the taxpayer has more than one type of freed-up credit, orthe taxpayer's credits are from more than one taxable year, then the creditreduction amount must be allocated either under the exact method of creditreduction, or if an election is made, under the simplified method. Section 1.58-9T(c)(5)(ii) of the temporary regulations provides that underthe exact method of credit reduction, for each type of freed-up creditsand for each taxable year within such type from which any such creditsare earned, the amount of credit reduction shall be equal to the amountof minimum tax attributable to the non-beneficial preferences that freedup the credits for that type and taxable year. The amount of the creditreduction is computed by multiplying the amount of non-beneficial preferenceswhich freed up credits for each type and taxable year by the minimum taxrate. In lieu of the exact credit reduction method, taxpayers may elect to usethe simplified credit reduction method described in andSection; 1.58-9T(c)(5)(iii)(A).Under the simplified credit reduction method, the amount of freed-up creditsfor each type of credit and for each taxable year from which such creditis carried over is multiplied by a fraction. The numerator of the fractionis the total credit reduction amount. The denominator is the total amountof freed-up credits. The product of this multiplication is the amount ofcredit reduction for each type and taxable year of freed-up credit. Section 1.58-9T(c)(5)(iii)(B) provides that a taxpayer may elect to usethe simplified credit reduction method for all taxable years to which theseregulations apply by attaching a statement indicating such an electionon the amended Federal income tax return or returns applying the adjustmentsof these regulations. If an election is made for any taxable year, it mustbe made for all taxable years. Once an election has been made, it can berevoked only with the permission of the Commissioner. Similarly, once returnshave been filed applying the exact credit reduction method, an electionto apply the simplified method can be made only with the consent of theCommissioner. Section 1.58-9T(c)(5)(iv) of the temporary regulations provides that underboth the exact method and the simplified method, the determination of creditcarrybacks and carryforwards to other taxable years is made on the basisof freed-up credits remaining after such reduction, plus any other unusedcredits. Thus, an amount of freed-up credits equal to the credit reductionamount shall not reduce tax liability in any taxable year. Such disallowanceis without regard to whether such credits would otherwise be allowed asa carryback or carryforward. No minimum tax liability shall be due withrespect to the non-beneficial preferences for any taxable year. Periods of Limitations; Adjustments to Tax Liability Section 1.58-9T(e)(2) of the temporary regulations provides that the adjustmentsdescribed in the temporary regulations shall, in general, apply for purposesof assessing deficiencies or claiming refunds of tax for any taxable yearfor which the tax liability for such year is affected by these adjustments,provided that the period of limitations under section 6501 has not expiredfor such taxable year. Therefore, these adjustments generally apply forpurposes of assessing deficiencies and refunding any overpayment of taxfor all years for which the period of limitations has not expired regardlessof whether the period of limitations has expired for the taxable year inwhich the non-beneficial preferences arose. However, the adjustments containedin these temporary regulations do not apply to reduce freed-up creditsotherwise allowable in any year where: (i) The taxpayer paid minimum tax on all tax preference items arising inthe taxable year in which the non-beneficial preference arose; (ii) The taxpayer has not made a claim for a credit or refund for suchminimum tax; and (iii) The period of limitations for claiming a credit or refund under section6511 has expired for such taxable year. Claim for Credit or Refund Section 1.58-9T(e)(3) of the temporary regulations provides that a taxpayergenerally pay claim a credit or refund of minimum tax that was paid onnon-beneficial preferences. However, such a claim for a credit or refundshall be disallowed to the extent that the taxpayer has reduced tax liabilityin a taxable year for which the period of limitations has expired by usingfreed-up credits in excess of the amount that would have been availableif the credit reduction required under these regulations had been made.Such a claim must be made by filing an amended return for the taxable yearfor which such minimum tax was paid. Further, if a claim for credit orrefund is filed, amended returns must also be filed for any taxable yearfor which tax liability would be affected as a result of the reduction,under these regulations, of credits freed up by such non-beneficial preferences.Net Operating Losses Section 1.58-9T(f) of the temporary regulations has been reserved for thepurpose of providing rules relating to the application of the tax benefitrule in cases where tax preference items provide no tax benefit in thecurrent taxable year because available net operating loss carrybacks orcarryforwards would have reduced or eliminated tax liability if the preferenceitems had not been allowed in computing taxable income. The Internal RevenueService intends to issue additional regulations at a later date which willaddress the adjustments required in such cases. <ITAG tagnum="84">Special Analyses </ITAG>No general notice of proposed rulemaking is required by 5 U.S.C. 553(b)for temporary regulations. Accordingly, the Regulatory Flexibility Actdoes not apply and no Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is required for thisrule. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue has determined that this temporaryrule is not a major rule as defined in Executive Order 12291 and that aregulatory impact analysis therefore is not required. Drafting Information The principal author of these temporary regulations is William A. Jacksonof the Office of Assistant Chief Counsel, Income Tax and Accounting, InternalRevenue Service. However, personnel from other offices of the InternalRevenue Service and Treasury Department participated in developing theregulation, both on matters of substance and style. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG>26 CFR 1.101-1_1.58-9 Income taxes, Tax liability, Tax rates, Credits. 26 CFR Part 602 Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of Amendments to the Regulations </ITAG>Accordingly, 26 CFR Parts 1 and 602 are amended as follows: <ITAG tagnum="56">PART 1_INCOME TAX; TAXABLE YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 31, 1953</ITAG><T4>Paragraph 1. </T4>The authority for Part 1 is amended by adding thefollowing citation:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 26 U.S.C. 7805  * * *  Section 1.58-9T is also issuedunder 26 U.S.C. 58(h).</ITAG><T4>Par. 2. </T4>A new andSection; 1.58-9T is added immediately followingandSection; 1.58-8 to read as set forth below: <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1.58-9T </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Application of the tax benefit rule to the minimum tax for taxableyears beginning prior to 1987 (Temporary). </ITAG>(a) <T3>In general.</T3> For purposes of computing the minimum tax liabilityimposed under section 56 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (Code), taxpayersare not liable for minimum tax on tax preference items from which no currenttax benefit is derived because available credits would have reduced oreliminated the taxpayer's regular tax liability if the preference itemshad not been allowed in computing taxable income. However, any creditsthat, because of such preference items, are not needed for use againstregular tax (``freed-up credits''), are required to be reduced under therules of paragraph (c) of this section. For purposes of this section, ataxpayer's regular tax is the Federal income tax liability under subchapterA of Chapter 1 of the Code, not including the minimum tax imposed by section56. Unless otherwise noted, all references to Internal Revenue Code sectionsrefer to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.

(2) <T3>Determine freed-up credits.</T3> (i) To determine the freed-up creditsfor the taxable year, first determine the regular tax that would have beenimposed if preference items had not been allowed in computing taxable income(``non-preference regular tax''). Second, compute the amount of creditsthat would have been allowed to reduce the non-preference regular tax.Third, subtract the amount of credits that were actually allowed to reducethe regular tax for such taxable year from the amount of credits that wouldhave been allowed to reduce non-preference regular tax. The result is theamount of the freed-up credits. (ii) The following examples illustrate the determination of freed-up credits:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1).</T3> In 1982 Corporation B has $17.6 million dollars inforeign tax credits available for the taxable year. Assume that the foreigntax credits being used in this example do not exceed the limitation undersection 904. If preference items were not allowed in determining regulartax, the regular tax would have been $10.2 million and foreign tax creditsused to reduce regular tax would have been $10.2 million. Because of taxpreference items, however, B's regular tax is $6.3 million and the amountof foreign tax credits actually used to reduce the regular tax is $6.3million. The amount of freed-up foreign tax credits is $3.9 million ($10.2million minus $6.3 million). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>Assume the same facts as in Example (1) except thatCorporation B has $7.2 million dollars in foreign tax credits. If preferenceitems were not allowed, the non-preference regular tax would have been$10.2 million and the foreign tax credits used to reduce the regular taxwould have been $7.2 million. Because of tax preference items, B's regulartax, however, is $6.3 million, and the foreign tax credits actually usedto reduce the regular tax is $6.3 million. The amount of freed-up foreigntax credits is $.9 million ($7.2 million minus $6.3 million). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (3). </T3>In 1983 Corporation C has $500,000 of investmenttax credit available. If preference items were not allowed, non-preferenceregular tax would have been $690,000 and all $500,000 of investment taxcredits would have been allowed to reduce non-preference regular tax liability.Because of tax preferences, however, C's actual regular tax is $439,750.As a result of the limitation under section 38(c), only $377,537 of theinvestment tax credits are allowed to reduce the actual regular tax. Freed-upcredits are $122,463 ($500,000 minus 377,537).</ITAG>(3) <T3>Determination of beneficial and non-beneficial preferences</T3>_(i)<T3>In general. </T3>The amount of tax preferences from which a currenttax benefit is derived (``beneficial preferences'') and the amount fromwhich no current tax benefit is derived (``non-beneficial preferences'')for the taxable year are determined as set forth below.(ii) <T3>Regular tax liability is the same regardless of preference items. </T3>(A)If the taxpayer's tax liability (after credits) would be the same regardlessof whether preference items were allowed to reduce taxable income, thenall of the taxpayer's preference items are non-beneficial preference items.(B) The following example illustrates the rule set forth in paragraph (C)(3)(ii)(A)of this section. This example assumes that foreign tax credits being useddo not exceed the limitation under section 904.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (4). </T3>Assume the facts in Example (1). All of B's $17.6million of credits are foreign tax credits. The total amount of B's taxpreference items is $8.4 million. B's non-preference regular tax is $10.2million and, reduced by foreign tax credits, is zero. B's actual regulartax is $6.3 million, and, reduced by foreign tax credits, is zero. Sincethe amount of credits that would have been allowed to offset the non-preferenceregular tax would have reduced such tax to an amount ($0) equal to theactual regular tax liability ($0), B received a tax benefit from none ofthe $8.4 million of tax preferences and therefore all of these preferencesare non-beneficial preferences. </ITAG>(iii) <T3>Regular Tax liability differs because of preference items. </T3>Iftax liability (after credits) is less because preference items are allowedto reduce taxable income, then some of these preference items have provideda current tax benefit. In such cases, the amount of beneficial and non-beneficialpreferences are determined as follows:(A) <T3>Non-beneficial preferences.</T3> (<T3>1</T3>) The non-beneficial preferences are determined by convertingthe freed-up credits for such taxable year into an amount of taxable income.To make this conversion, freed-up credits are ``grossed up'' (<T3>i.e.,</T3> divided by the regular tax marginal rate at which such creditswould have offset non-preference regular tax) to determine the amount oftax preferences that freed up such credits.For purposes of this calculation, the 5-percent addition to tax providedby section 11(b) shall be included in determining the marginal rate. Theaggregate of these grossed-up amounts is the total amount of non-beneficialpreferences for the taxable year.(<T3>2</T3>) The freed-up credits shall be grossed up beginning at the lowestmarginal tax rate that would have applied to the additional taxable incomearising if tax preferences were not allowed. Thus, the marginal tax ratesat which the actual regular tax was imposed shall not be taken into accountin grossing up freed-up credits, even if all or a portion of such tax isnot offset by credits because of limitations on the allowance of such credits(such as the section 904 limit on foreign tax credits or the section 38(c)limit on investment tax credits). For example, if the first dollar of additionalnon-preference taxable income would have been taxed at a rate of 46 percent,then freed-up credits shall be grossed up at 46 percent, even if regulartax imposed on taxable income at a 40-percent rate was not offset by creditsbecause of the limitations on investment tax credits under section 38(c).<T3>See </T3>Examples (12) and (13) in paragraph (d) of this section forillustrations of the gross up of freed-up credits in cases where limitationsapply to the amount of credit allowed to offset actual regular tax.(<T3>3</T3>) The following example illustrates the gross up of freed-upcredits to determine non-beneficial preferences.

This rule may be illustrated by the following example:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (6).</T3> Assume the same facts as in Example (5). The amountof L's beneficial preferences for 1985 is $25,544 (total preferences of$110,000, minus non-beneficial preferences of $84,456).</ITAG>(4) <T3>Determine the minimum tax attributable to non-beneficial preferences</T3>.(i) The portion of the minimum tax that is attributable to the non-beneficialpreferences is computed as follows_(A) Compute the minimum tax that would be imposed on all tax preferenceitems for the taxable year if all of the preferences had produced a taxbenefit.(B) Compute the minimum tax that would be imposed on the beneficial preferencesif these were the taxpayer's only preferences. (This is the amount of minimumtax actually imposed for the taxable year.)(C) Subtract the amount computed in (B) from the amount computed in (A).The result is the minimum tax attributable to the non-beneficial preferencesfor the taxable year. This amount is sometimes referred to hereinafteras the ``credit reduction amount''.(ii) The following examples illustrate determination of the credit reductionamount.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (7)</T3>. Assume the facts in Example (4) above. Since B has$8.4 million in total preference items and no regular tax liability, theminimum tax on that amount would be $1,258,500 (($8.4 million minus $10,000)multiplied by .15). None of the preference items is a beneficial preference.Thus, the minimum tax attributable to non-beneficial preferences (and therefore,the credit reduction amount) is $1,258,500.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (8)</T3>. Assume the facts in Example (5) above. The minimumtax on L's total preference items of $110,000 would be $15,000 (($110,000minus $10,000) multiplied by .15). Since the amount of non-beneficial preferencesis $84,456, the amount of L's beneficial preferences for 1985 is $25,544($110,000 minus $84,456). The minimum tax on L's beneficial preferencesof $25,544 is $2,332 (($25,544 minus $10,000) multiplied by .15). (Thisis the amount of minimum tax imposed for 1985.) The minimum tax attributableto non-beneficial preference items (and therefore, the credit reductionamount) is $12,668 ($15,000 minus $2,332).</ITAG>(5) <T3>Reduction of freed-up credits</T3>_(i)<T3> In general</T3>. The freed-up credits are reduced by an amount equalto the minimum tax attributable to the non-beneficial preferences (``creditreduction amount''). If the taxpayer has only one type of freed-up credit(<T3>i.e., </T3>only investment tax credit or only foreign tax credit) andthat credit was earned in only one year (the current year or a carrybackor carryforward year), then the credit is reduced by the credit reductionamount. This rule may be illustrated by the following example:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (9)</T3>. Assume the facts in Example (7) above. Further assumethat all of the $3.9 million of freed-up credits are foreign tax creditsthat arise in the same year and that otherwise would be carried forward.Since the entire amount of B's tax preferences are non-beneficial preferences,the minimum tax of $1,258,500 that would be imposed on the total tax preferencesis the credit reduction amount. Thus, B's $3.9 million of freed-up foreigntax credits is reduced by $1,258,500. The foreign tax credit carried forwardfrom 1982 is $10,041,500. This amount is the sum of $2,641,500 (the freed-upforeign tax credit of $3,900,000, reduced by the credit reduction amountof $1,258,500), plus $7.4 million (the foreign tax credit that would havebeen carried over even if tax preference items had not been allowed).</ITAG>However, if the taxpayer has more than one type of freed-up credit, orthe taxpayer's freed-up credits are from more than one taxable year, thenthe credit reduction amount must be allocated under the exact method describedin paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section, unless an election is made underparagraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section to use the simplified method.(ii) <T3>Exact method</T3>. For each type of freed-up credits and for each taxableyear within such type from which any such credits are earned, the amountof credit reduction shall be equal to the amount of minimum tax attributableto the non-beneficial preferences that freed up the credits for that typeand taxable year. The amount of the credit reduction is computed by multiplyingthe amount of non-beneficial preferences which freed up credits for eachtype and taxable year by the minimum tax rate. For purposes of this computation,if the amount of the taxpayer's minimum tax exemption for the taxable year(as determined under section 56(a)) exceeds the amount of the taxpayer'sbeneficial preferences, such excess exemption shall reduce the amount ofnon-beneficial preferences to be multiplied by the minimum tax rate. Thenon-beneficial preferences shall be reduced by any such excess exemptionin the same order in which the credits that were freed up by such preferenceswould have been allowed to offset tax. Thus, for example, any excess exemptionshall first reduce non-beneficial preferences that freed up foreign taxcredits. Any such excess exemption remaining after reducing non-beneficialpreferences that freed up foreign tax credits to zero would then be usedto reduce the non-beneficial preferences that freed up investment tax credits.(iii) <T3>Simplified method</T3>_(A)<T3> Description of method</T3>. In lieu of the exact credit reductionmethod described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section, taxpayers mayelect to use the simplified credit reduction method. Under the simplifiedcredit reduction method, the amount of freed-up credits for each type ofcredit and for each taxable year in which such credit is earned is multipliedby a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the total credit reductionamount as determined in paragraph (c)(4)(i)(C) of this section. The denominatoris the total amount of freed-up credits as determined in paragraph (c)(2)(i)of this section. The product of this multiplication is the amount of creditreduction for each type and taxable year of freed-up credit.(B) <T3>Election to use simplified method</T3>. A taxpayer may elect to usethe simplified credit reduction method for all taxable years to which thissection applies by attaching a statement indicating such an election onthe amended Federal income tax return or returns applying the adjustmentsof this section. If an election is made for any taxable year, it must bemade for all taxable years. Once an election has been made, it can be revokedonly with the permission of the Commissioner. Similarly, once returns havebeen filed applying the exact credit reduction method, an election to applythe simplified method can be made only with the consent of the Commissioner.(iv) <T3>Effect of credit reduction on credit carrybacks and carryforwards.</T3>Under both the exact method and the simplified method, the determinationof credit carrybacks and carryforwards to other taxable years is made onthe basis of freed-up credits remaining after such reduction, plus anyother unused credits. Thus, an amount of freed-up credits that is equalto the credit reduction amount shall not be allowed to reduce tax liabilityin any taxable year. Such disallowance is without regard to whether suchcredits would otherwise be allowed as a carryback or carryforward. No minimumtax liability shall be due with respect to the non-beneficial preferencesfor any taxable year.

The creditreduction amount for 1985 is $12,668, the amount of minimum tax attributableto L's non-beneficial preferences.

L's $38,250 of freed-up credits consists of $18,250 of foreigntax credits carried froward from 1984, which were freed up by $40,978 ofnon-beneficial preferences, and $20,000 of investment tax credits carriedforward from 1984, which were freed up by $43,478 of non-beneficial preferences.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) The apportionment of this credit reduction amount to each categoryof freed-up credit and each taxable year from which such credits are carriedover is determined as follows under the exact credit reduction method:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(i) Foreign tax credits carried forward from 1984:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Non-beneficial preferences that freed up 1984 FTCandmultiply;.15=Creditreduction of 1984 FTC</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">$40,978andmultiply;.15=$6,146</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) Investment tax credits carried forward from 1984: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Non-beneficial preferences that freed up 1984 ITCandmultiply;.15=Creditreduction of 1984 ITC</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">$43,478andmultiply;.15=$6,522</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">Thus, the foreign tax credits from 1984 that are carried forward to1986 are $12,104 ($18,250 minus $6,146).

If during any taxable year, propertyto which section 47 applies is disposed of, then for purposes of determiningany increase in tax under section 47 for such year, the amount of any reductionunder this section of freed-up section 38 credit which was earned in theyear the property was placed in service shall be treated as a credit thatwas allowed in a prior taxable year.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (14)</T3>. Assume corporation D places property in servicein 1983 that generates investment tax credits of $10,000. D earned no otherinvestment tax credits in 1983. None of the investment tax credits areused to reduce tax liability in 1983 or any prior years. In 1984, D uses$1,000 of this credit to reduce regular tax liability. In addition, D hasitems of tax preference in 1984. However, under section 58(h), D is notliable for minimum tax on any of these preference items because none ofthese preference items produced a tax benefit in 1984. As a result, anadjustment is made under the provisions of andSection; 1.58-9T and the investmenttax credit carryforward from 1983 is reduced by $4,000. Thus, D has aninvestment tax credit carryforward of $5,000 that is attributable to theproperty placed in service in 1983. In 1986, the property is disposed ofand the investment tax credits earned in 1983 are recomputed as requiredunder section 47. This recomputation results in a reduction of $6,000 ofthe investment tax credits earned in 1983. D must now adjust its 1983 investmenttax credit carryforward under section 47(a)(6) by reducing this carryforwardto zero. In addition, D has an additional tax liability of $1,000 for 1986.</ITAG>(2) <T3>Period of limitations; adjustments to tax liability</T3>. (i) The adjustmentsdescribed in this section shall, in general, apply for purposes of assessingdeficiencies or claiming refunds of tax for any taxable year for whichthe tax liability is affected by the adjustments of this section, providedthat the period of limitations under section 6501 has not expired for suchtaxable year. Therefore, these adjustments generally apply for purposesof assessing deficiencies and refunding any overpayment of tax for allyears for which the period of limitations has not expired regardless ofwhether the period of limitations has expired for the taxable year in whichthe non-beneficial preferences arose.(ii) However, the adjustments of this section do not apply to reduce otherwiseallowable credits that were freed up by such non-beneficial preferenceswhere:(A) The taxpayer paid minimum tax on all tax preference items arising inthe taxable year in which the non-beneficial preferences arose;(B) The taxpayer has not made a claim for a credit or refund for such minimumtax; and(C) The period of limitations for claiming a credit or refund under section6511 has expired for such taxable year.(iii) Further, if_(A) The taxpayer never paid minimum tax attributable to non-beneficialpreferences,(B) Credits that were freed up by such preferences were used to reducetax liability for a taxable year for which the period of limitations hasexpired, and(C) Credits so used exceed the amount of credits that would have been availableif the credit reduction required under this section with respect to suchpreferences had been made,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">then the taxpayer shall be liable for the minimum tax equal to theamount of credits so used, provided the period of limitations has not expiredfor the taxable year in which preferences arose.(3) <T3>Claims for credit or refund. </T3>A taxpayer may claim a credit orrefund of minimum tax that was paid on non-beneficial preferences. However,such a claim for a credit or refund shall be disallowed to the extent thatthe taxpayer has reduced tax liability in a taxable year for which theperiod of limitations has expired by using freed-up credits in excess ofthe amount that would have been available if the credit reduction requiredunder this section had been made. Such claim must be made by filing anamended return for the taxable year for which such minimum tax was paid.Further, if a claim for credit or refund is filed, amended returns mustalso be filed for any taxable year for which tax liability would be affectedas a result of the reduction, under this section, of credits freed up bysuch non-beneficial preferences. See section 6511 and the regulations thereunderregarding the period of limitations for claiming a credit or refund.(4) <T3>Carryforwards of foreign tax credit to taxable years after 1986. </T3>Inthe case of foreign tax credit carryforwards to taxable years beginningafter December 31, 1986, reductions in such credits required under thissection shall apply for purposes of computing the alternative minimum taxforeign tax credit under section 59(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of1986 as well as for purposes of computing the foreign tax credit for regulartax purposes.(5) <T3>Credit carrybacks. </T3>If credit carrybacks increase the amount ofcredits for a taxable year, the adjustments described in this section shallbe recomputed taking into account the additional credits. This rule maybe illustrated by the following examples:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (15)</T3>. Assume that in 1981, corporation D has actual taxableincome of $72,500 and regular tax before credits of $15,000. Also assumethat, in computing actual regular taxable income, D made use of $36,739of tax preference items, so that D's taxable income determined as thoughpreference were not allowed would be $109,239. D's non-preference regulartax before credits is $30,000. D earned $25,000 of foreign tax creditsin 1981, none of which exceed the limitation under section 904 determinedusing either actual regular taxable income or the non-preference taxableincome.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">These credits reduce actual regular tax to zero ($0) and would havereduced non-preference regular tax to $5,000 ($30,000 minus $25,000). Thus,D has freed-up foreign tax credits from 1981 of $10,000 ($25,000 minus$15,000). Pursuant to the adjustments required under this section, D determinesthat its credit reduction amount is $3,843 and reduces its freed-up credit(and its credit carryover) from 1981 to $6,157 ($10,000 minus $3,843).D also pays minimum tax of $167 on $11,114 of beneficial preferences (($11,114minus $10,000) multiplied by .15).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In 1982, D earns additional foreign tax credits. After applicationof the foreign tax credit carryback rules, D would have $5,000 of 1982foreign tax credits available for use in 1981. D must recalculate the adjustmentsrequired under this section by treating $5,000 of foreign tax credit from1982 as carried back and (assuming that these credits do not exceed thelimitation under section 904) used to reduce non-preference regular taxliability in 1981 to zero ($0). That is, $5,000 of the foreign tax creditsearned in 1982 are treated as credits freed up because of D's tax preferenceitems in 1981. Pursuant to the rules set forth herein, D must take intoaccount the foreign tax credits from both 1981 and 1982 in determiningto what extent a tax benefit was derived from the preference items usedto determine actual regular tax liability in 1981 and in computing thecredit reduction amount. When the $5,000 of foreign tax credits from 1982are considered, all preferences become non-beneficial preferences, andthe credit reduction amount is $4,010. Assuming that D elects the simplifiedmethod, the 1981 freed-up credits and the 1982 freed-up credits will eachbe reduced by the following percentage:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,32,1,5</C> <H1>4,010 (credit reduction amount)</H1><H2>15,000 (total freed up credits)</H2><H1>=</H1><H1>.2673</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">The 1981 freed-up foreign tax credits of $10,000 are thus reducedby $2,673 ($10,000 multiplied by .2673), to $7,327 and the 1982 freed-upforeign tax credits of $5,000 are reduced by $1,334 ($5,000 multipliedby .2673) to $3,666. D also files a claim for credit or refund of the $167of minimum tax paid in 1981.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (16). </T3>In 1985, corporation E's non-preference regulartaxable income is $25,000. E has no available credits. It pays zero inregular tax, however, because of $25,000 in preference items. E paid $2,250of minimum tax on these preferences (($25,000 minus $10,000) multipliedby .15). In 1986, E has additional investment tax credits. After applicationof the investment tax credit carryback rules, E would have $1,000 investmenttax credit from 1986 available for use in 1985. E must recompute the adjustmentsrequired under this section by treating $1,000 of these 1986 investmenttax credits as carried back and used to reduce non-preference regular taxliability for 1985. Pursuant to the rules of this section, all of these$1,000 of credits are freed-up credits. Non-beneficial preferences are$6,667 ($1,000 grossed up at a 15 percent regular tax rate). Beneficialpreferences are $18,333 ($25,000 minus $6,667). Minimum tax on all preferenceswould be $2,250 (($25,000 minus $10,000) multiplied by .15); minimum taxon beneficial preferences would be $1,250 (($18,333 minus $10,000) multipliedby .15) Minimum tax attributable to the non-beneficial preferences is thus$1,000 ($2,250 minus $1,250), which is the credit reduction amount. E thusreduces the $1,000 of credits carried back to 1985 to zero. Under the rulesof this section, the amount of minimum tax due for 1985 is redetermined.It is equal to the minimum tax on beneficial preferences, which, as describedabove, is $1,250. Because E paid minimum tax of $2,250 in 1985, E filesa claim for credit or refund for $1,000 of the minimum tax paid in 1985.</ITAG>(f) <T3>Treatment of net operating losses. </T3>[Reserved]<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 602_OMB CONTROL NUMBERS UNDER THE PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT</ITAG><T4>Par. </T4>3.
