Sex? Just flip on your TV set.   But there's another three-letter word that's stillshrouded in inhibitions. It's PAY. The less said about it,the better, a lot of people on both sides of the paycheckbelieve.</LP><TEXT>   Public companies, of course, must disclose top executives'salaries, and labor contracts are public knowledge. Butbetween Ross Johnson and the union hall, most salaries arediscussed in whispers, if at all. Paychecks come in sealedenvelopes, and some companies forbid employees to disclosetheir salaries.   Talking about pay &quot;borders on the vulgar,&quot; declares LyleClapper, co-owner of Clapper Communications, a Park Ridge,Ill., publisher. &quot;It's a real emotional issue, and (inbusiness) emotional issues need to be quiet.&quot;   Employees, too, are queasy. Etta Williams, a claimsrepresentative at Allstate Insurance Co.'s Cheshire, Conn.,office, says colleagues applauded her at a recent ceremonywhere she was awarded a special cash bonus. But she didn'twant Allstate to announce the amount. &quot;You're dealing withhuman beings,&quot; warns Ms. Williams. &quot;So far we get along greathere, and I'd like to keep it that way.&quot;   Pay secrecy, however, is becoming an increasinglydifficult policy to maintain, particularly as companies lookto strengthen the link between pay and performance. At thesame time, employees are less willing to accept the companyline on pay. And as they begin to bargain individually oversuch options as flexible schedules or part-time work, saysElaine Evans, a consultant with Wyatt Co., &quot;they are saying,`Why can't I know about pay?'&quot;   Next Inc. may be the only major company in the U.S. wherethe answer is, &quot;You can.&quot; Lists of all employees' salarieshang in company offices at Redwood City and Fremont, Calif.,and anyone can consult them. &quot;We're not dancing around theproblem,&quot; says Phillip E. Wilson, vice president of humanresources for the computer company started by Steve Jobs, thecofounder of Apple Computer Co. Anything less than openness,he says, &quot;doesn't establish the same level of trust.&quot; Next'sattitude, he adds, was a major draw in wooing him fromCummins Engine Co., which keeps a much tighter clamp onsalary data. But Mr. Wilson admits that such a &quot;huge culturalshift&quot; is easier for a startup company like Next.   &quot;Once you're in it, it makes perfect sense. You wonder whyother companies don't do it,&quot; says Kathryn Kilcoyne, directorof marketing communications for Next. She has seen many newhires at Next react to the news of its policy incredulously,saying, &quot;You do? They know?&quot; Ms. Kilcoyne herself was&quot;extremely apprehensive about it&quot; at first, but she's foundit makes managing easier. Now, when she interviews potentialnew employees, if they express too much caution about theidea, she questions whether they will fit into the Nextculture.   Most companies experimenting with openness seek a balancebetween old ways and new. Vanessa Jorgenson, a Calfed Inc.branch manager, was old school when it came to pay. Beforeshe joined the bank two years ago, she was a manager in adepartment store where, she says, &quot;you didn't breathesalaries.&quot; People figured that if employees learned whatothers made, &quot;who knew what else would come out?&quot;   Even at Calfed, when she joined the bank, pay informationtraveled primarily by the grapevine, she says, and a managerheard about it only when someone &quot;up and walked out thedoor.&quot; If Ms. Jorgenson got a complaint, it would be a longgame of &quot;telephone&quot; just to get the necessary information toexplain employee salaries, let alone act on it.   But today Calfed is a more open company, and she finds outfaster whether ill will over pay is eroding morale. She has,she says, a better chance of keeping people she has trainedand invested in. And Ms. Jorgenson now is armed with factsand figures. Calfed's new Pay for Performance guide has abold, four-inch green dollar sign on its cover and datainside ranging from how to compute a merit increase to salarybrackets for every job. She can share the contents withemployees and use this information in discussing pay withthem. And she can tap into Calfed's data banks to find outhow much other branches -- or competitors -- are paying.   If someone complains that Joe Schmo is making more, &quot;firstyou figure out whether Joe Schmo is making more,&quot; says Ms.Jorgenson. She won't disclose Joe's exact salary to thecomplaining employee. But, if appropriate, she may make upthe difference. Or she may explain why Joe should be makingmore. Maybe he supervises more people than the employee who'scomplaining; maybe he was hired with higher expectations onthe company's part and &quot;if (he) doesn't perform within 90days, (he) may not have a job.&quot;   Once employees know their boss will answer such questions,says Ms. Jorgenson, word gets around. Before, she says, &quot;itwas always taboo in their eyes; you just didn't ask.&quot;   Traditionally, in fact, that's the way companies liked it.Bob Baird, who taught training at the General MotorsInstitute in the 1970s, remembers signing a form that barredhim from discussing his own salary. Fewer companies now takethat tack, but it isn't unheard of. In fact, although GeneralMotors Corp.'s operating companies have never required it,says a spokeswoman, GM's Electronic Data Systems Corp. unitis adamant on the subject. New hires, says spokesman RogerStill, sign a form acknowledging several policies, includingthis one: Employees are allowed to disclose their salaries,but if such disclosure leads to &quot;disruption,&quot; they can befired.   In many companies, the message trickles down even if itisn't written down. Fran Stetson, a secretary for HealthNortheast in Manchester, N.H., says that managers at herformer office made sure that even the payroll accountantcaught their &quot;paranoia. If you walked into her office whileshe was working on it, she'd literally throw herself over thedesk.&quot;   U.S. courts have generally supported companies in theirview that salary information, like a product formula or amarketing strategy, is confidential and the property ofmanagement. An employee who ferrets out and releases suchdata can be discharged for &quot;willful misconduct,&quot; says MarkDichter, an attorney at Morgan Lewis Bockius in Philadelphia.In a legal battle concerning overtime pay at NBC News,employees earlier this month won a ruling that managementmust release to them the salaries of top staffers. But theplaintiffs' use of the information was limited so that noneof it can be disclosed to anyone else.   For many years, the cloak over salary served a darkpurpose. &quot;There were no (pay) systems, no grades,&quot; says FredCook, a New York consultant. &quot;Pay was (figured) on the backof an envelope, women got screwed, favorite sons were takencare of.&quot;   And managers saw the confidential information as acritical element of control. &quot;Giving pay information to asubordinate . . . empowers&quot; him, says Ed Lawler, a professorat the University of Southern California. Of course, it alsoopens to scrutiny the boss's own salary. When Mr. Wilsondescribed Next's open policy to a group of counterparts atFortune 200 companies recently, their reactions, he says,were &quot;Ridiculous] Impossible]&quot; The sticking point? &quot;Primarilythe notion that you can never sufficiently defend to theordinary folk (what) you pay to senior people.&quot;   But even companies ready to open up have to fight apsychology that is ingrained long before an executive or anemployee goes to work. &quot;Lots of people don't talk to theirchildren about money any more than they talk to them aboutsex,&quot; says Linda Barbanel, a therapist who specializes inmoney matters. &quot;So the same sorts of feelings get attached;it's dirty and it's not nice.&quot; Pay is doubly sensitivebecause many Americans tie their ego directly to theirpaycheck.   Thus, employees often join the boss in keeping salariessecret. &quot;In a sense, it's a conspiracy between the individualand management,&quot; says Prof. Lawler. &quot;It's the old joke: Idon't talk about my pay because I'm embarrassed, and theorganization doesn't talk about it because they'reembarrassed.&quot;   Employees may even be skittish about learning each other'ssalaries. They are loath to know something that may onlyanger them, says Ms. Barbanel, especially if they feelpowerless to do anything about it. Ms. Stetson, the HealthNortheast secretary, is furious about one colleague who makesmore than she does but who, Ms. Stetson feels, doesn't pullher weight. &quot;It just creates hard feelings&quot; if you know whatother people make, she says. &quot;Sometimes, ignorance is bliss.&quot;   Sensitivity about money, in fact, is often compounded bysensitivity about a closely related topic: performance. Andthis is where the debate on openness is joined. &quot;Some peoplewith exactly the same job description and years on the jobmay be making more . . . than the person sitting right nextto them,&quot; says Mr. Still of EDS. Why? &quot;Because maybe they'redoing a better job.&quot;   For EDS, that's good reason to reject the open approach. Acritical competitive tool for the company, says Mr. Still, isthe manager's ability to motivate employees case by case.&quot;There's a lot of discretion given to managers,&quot; he explains.&quot;If the employees begin to manage that process themselves . .. truly that takes that power away from (managers).&quot;   But Next's Ms. Kilcoyne argues, &quot;Why do you need secrecy?&quot;She discusses salary details with her team of 12subordinates, including how much a new hire should be paid orwho gets a bonus. Sure, it may be hard to hear that someoneelse makes more, she admits. But if employees understand andbelieve the system is fair, they're going to say,&quot;Absolutely, Phyllis deserves to get that.&quot;   Mr. Wilson says the system works well partly because itdoesn't try to make the narrow pay distinctions othercompensation experts believe in. Next pays employees in thesame classification about the same salary. And whenexecutives get raises, they're likely to be in increments ofat least $5,000. &quot;Don't pretend that . . . you can sort out(more) variables of human behavior than we can balance in ourfeeble minds,&quot; he warns.   But that philosophy still doesn't have many believers,even among advocates of openness. Richard Bevan, a vicepresident of Towers Perrin, a compensation consultant, usedto be an &quot;idealist&quot; on the subject, he confesses. Now, hesays, &quot;I'm a pragmatist.&quot; Even where a company has the mostrational system, he says, &quot;life is too complicated&quot; toexplain every detail to employees. It's not practical, headds, to justify to other employees why a fellow worker got agood raise despite a poor performance rating: &quot;He had somefamily crisis for six months this year, really hisperformance is better, plus we suspect that this type ofcomputer analyst is a rare bird.'&quot;   When a company lets everyone know the salary or bonusbudget, says Mr. Cook, the consultant, it runs into problems.With a limited pool of money, some employees have to get only&quot;average&quot; increases or less while others get more. Whatmanager, asks Mr. Cook, wants to motivate his employee bysaying, &quot;Let me make sure you understand. You're average&quot;?   Some companies that want to reward employees for extraproductivity try to avoid dollars altogether. ClapperCommunications makes non-cash awards, such as microwave ovensand diamond pendants. If employees get too much informationon salaries, says Mr. Clapper, &quot;I get into the job of provingto the whole company that my decisions are good. We're notdemocracies. We're corporations.&quot;   But where companies are pushing workplace democracy,communication becomes critical. U.S. productivity problemsare partly a result of treating employees like children,argues Next's Mr. Wilson. Letting employees in on salary datais the same as letting them in on who might be a newjoint-venture partner, says Ms. Kilcoyne. The message is,&quot;You're on the inside, not the outside.&quot;   Next recently promoted one manager, with a raise to$36,000, after considering an outside hire for the sameopening at $45,000. Aware of the earlier plan, the managercomplained. Mr. Wilson explained that Next had decided to letsomeone from inside grow into the job rather than buy ahigher level of experience. &quot;I spend a lot of time educatingpeople&quot; about how compensation works, he says.   Managers at Donnelly Corp., a large manufacturer ofautomotive glass based in Holland, Mich., believe thatemployees should get salary data for the same reasons theynow get information on technology or markets. &quot;We'recommitted to getting people involved in decisions that haveto do with money,&quot; says Mr. Baird, the former instructor atthe GM Institute and now Donnelly's manager of organizationaldevelopment. Employees are elected from all company levels toserve on committees that make decisions, from manufacturingtechnique to pricing to benefits and pay brackets.   ---   Ms. Solomon reports on management from The Wall StreetJournal's Washington bureau.</TEXT></DOC>
