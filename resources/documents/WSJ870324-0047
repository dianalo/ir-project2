Garcia</HL><DD> 03/24/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   Blue-chip stocks continued to roar on to new highs in yesterday's busy session, leaving some other sectors of the stock market in the dust.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record 2363.78, up 30.26. The gain comes after an advance of nearly 75 points last week.    Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.99 to 301.16, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 1.46 to 170.83 -- both establishing new highs.    But traders were dismayed to see the Dow Jones Transportation Average fall 1.34 to 947.55, dragged down mostly by losses in airline stocks. Although the industrial average has scored five consecutive record closes, the transportation average still is well below its high of 958.21, set March 6.    The over-the-counter market failed to keep up with yesterday's rally. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 1.60 to 438.04, with computer and financial stocks especially weak.    Traders said that buying by some U.S. institutions and foreign investors as well as some buy programs linked to stock-index futures powered yesterday's advance.    The scarcity of sellers and a keen interest among some money managers to invest spare cash before the end of the quarter put &quot;the bias on the upside,&quot; said Peter Furniss, a vice president in the equity trading department at Smith Barney Harris Upham.    Wall Street professionals were especially aggressive buyers. Traders said many had sold borrowed stock short late Friday in hope of buying it back at lower prices when yesterday's trading got under way. Prices ran up sharply Friday as investors bought shares to settle positions against expiring stock-index futures, index options and options on individual stocks.    The short sellers had been betting that some of Friday's big price gains would be reversed, in line with past experience on the trading day after quarterly expirations. But that bet kept looking more and more risky as prices continued to march higher, so many of the short sellers gave up their strategy and became buyers in order to close out their short positions.    Chrysler's pension fund was one of the buyers in yesterday's market. According to vice president and treasurer Frederick W. Zuckerman, the auto maker has invested $405 million in the stock market from last Wednesday through yesterday. The funds represent a previously announced shift of assets to stocks from bonds.    Mr. Zuckerman said the company still has to shift between $400 million and $500 million, currently invested mostly in mortgage securities and corporate bonds.    American Telephone andamp; Telegraph, the subject of a favorable cover story in this week's issue of Barron's, rose 7/8 to 24 7/8. It was the most active Big Board issue, with more than 3.6 million shares traded. Chairman James Olson told analysts in Boston late last week that the telecommunications giant's cash flow for the first two months of 1987 was above budget expectations. He didn't indicate how profits were running.    Texas Instruments gained 4 1/2 to 180 on 213,100 shares. Yesterday's Wall Street Journal reported that the Reagan administration is likely to decide this week to impose sanctions on Japanese microchip makers for violating last summer's semiconductor trade accord.    Other semiconductor issues were mixed: Advanced Micro Devices was unchanged at 21 1/4, Motorola rose 1/2 to 56 1/4, National Semiconductor inched up 1/8 to 16 1/4 and Intel fell 3/8 to 39 1/8 in OTC trading.    Many other technology stocks didn't participate in yesterday's rally. Digital Equipment fell 5/8 to 165 7/8, Hewlett-Packard lost 5/8 to 60 5/8, Unisys slipped 1/2 to 107, Cray Research slid 2 1/2 to 123 1/2 and Apple Computer fell 3/4 to 67 1/2 in OTC trading. But Honeywell rose 3/4 to 72 1/8 and NCR gained 1 3/8 to 69 1/8.    Wendy's International rose 7/8 to 12 5/8 on more than 3.5 million shares. The company declined to comment on a story in the March 30 issue of Business Week that reported that Coca-Cola Co. might be interested in acquiring Wendy's.    Coca-Cola, in a rare departure from its policy of not commenting on merger and acquisition rumors, said it wasn't interested in acquiring Wendy's. Coca-Cola rose 1/2 to 47 7/8.    Harper andamp; Row galloped ahead 4 1/2 to 54 1/2. The publishing firm said several domestic and foreign firms have expressed interest regarding an acquisition or other transactions.    ChemLawn, which rose 7/8 to 36 7/8 in OTC trading, agreed to be acquired by Ecolab for about $370 million. On the Big Board, Ecolab fell 2 5/8 to 28 1/4 and Waste Management, which had also been trying to acquire ChemLawn, rose 1 to 79 3/8.    Cyclops rose 7/8 to 91 3/8. Late Friday, Halcyon Investments, a New York securities partnership, said it bought a 7.1% stake in Cyclops. Dixons Group, which had already claimed victory in its bid to acquire Cyclops by acquiring a 54% stake, agreed Friday to reopen its tender offer. Also, an investor group led by Audio/Video Affiliates boosted its offer for Cyclops to $92.50 a share from $80.    Genentech gained 2 1/4 to 61 in the OTC market. The Wall Street Journal reported that Genentech's clot-dissolving drug, Tissue Plasminogen Activator, may soon win Food and Drug Administration approval as a treatment of heart attacks.    ICN Pharmaceuticals fell 1 to 18 3/4. The company said it would buy as many as three million shares from time to time in the open market, and as many as 500,000 shares each of Viratek and SPI Pharmaceuticals, its two units. Viratek was unchanged at 43 and SPI rose 1/2 to 25 1/4.    Wickes rose 1/8 to 4 on volume of more than 1.8 million shares on the American Stock Exchange. The company declared a reverse 1-for-5 stock split and said it plans to sell its 85% interest in its English subsidiary for the current equivalent of about $155 million.    Paper and forest product issues were big performers. International Paper gained 2 3/8 to 106 1/4, Kimberly-Clark rose 3 1/8 to 117 1/2, Mead advanced 1 1/4 to 72, Champion International moved up 1 7/8 to 41 1/4, Great Northern Nekoosa rose 2 to 95, Union Camp moved up 1 1/4 to 69 7/8 and Stone Container added 3 7/8 to 93 1/8.    ASA closed up 2 3/8 at 54 1/4 after trading as high as 56 1/2. The closed-end fund, which invests in South African mining company shares, denied rumors that it was about to convert to an open-ended fund.    McDonald's rose 2 1/2 to 79 5/8. The stock was recommended by Goldman Sachs. </TEXT></DOC>
