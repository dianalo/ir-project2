State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley, reiterating whatshe termed ``our support for the supremacy of civilianconstitutional rule,'' said ``we continue to recognize PresidentDelvalle as the president of Panama.''   Asked to describe the legal grounds for such recognition, shesaid, ``I don't think it's for us to interpret their constitutionallaw. We had regarded him as the president, we still regard him asthe president.''   She described the situation among Panamanian political figuresas one of ``a great deal of political maneuvering.''   She said Delvalle's decision to fire Manuel Antonio Noriega asthe nation's defense chief _ which precipated Delvalle's ouster bythe assembly _ ``took great courage and we continue with ourpolicy.''

Mrs. Oakley also said the United States continues to recognizeJuan B. Sosa as Panama's ambassador in Washington. Sosa hassupported Delvalle.   ``I informed the state department that I will continue withhim,'' Sosa said, referring to his support for Delvalle.   ``I'm sure they will try to send another ambassador,'' he said,adding that he had asked for continued recognition by the U.S.government.   Mrs. Oakley said Elliot Abrams, the assistant secretary of statefor Inter-American affairs, met with Sosa this morning, but shewouldn't reveal details of the discussion.   ``Many people knew that we had been aware of the actions thatPresident Delvalle was contemplating doing,'' she said. ``We hadbeen informed that the decision was President Delvalle's own tomake.''   ``I'm not going to get into who was behind what; who saidwhat,'' she said. ``This is obviously an unstable period,confused.''   ``The situation there obviously has to clarify,'' she said.
