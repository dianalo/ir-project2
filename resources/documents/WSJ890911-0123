Of the 11 countries reporting, only Austria, Italy and France showed year-to-year gains.    Industry and government statistics from the 11 countries, which normally account for about 85% of non-Communist Europe's passenger-car sales, showed volume slipped 0.7% in July from a year earlier to 827,199 units. The July figure was down 19% from June.    The flat year-to-year picture contrasts with an average growth rate of 6% for the year to date and fits the expectations of many analysts that growth for the whole year will be below 5%.    But the increasing use of incentive programs in such key markets as Britain and West Germany may keep sales from slipping behind last year's levels for the balance of the year. With operating profit margins running at historic highs for the sector, manufacturers &quot;have a lot of room to play with&quot; on prices, said John Lawson, an analyst with the Nomura Research Institute in London. </TEXT></DOC>
