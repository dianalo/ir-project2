Car insurance premiums in the state, which average $1,000, are the highest in the nation. And those premiums comprise a significant part of the revenue of such industry heavyweights as Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co.'s Allstate Insurance Co. unit, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. and Prudential Property andamp; Casualty Insurance Co., a unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of America.    Although Gov. Thomas Kean is expected to sign the bills, insurers and consumer groups aren't convinced that the measures ultimately will solve the problems. &quot;Until we see what the regulators do in response to the bills, we don't know what the effect will be,&quot; said James Perry, associate general counsel at State Farm. &quot;It could work, or be a disaster.&quot;    One reason drivers still aren't happy is that under terms of the new legislation, they will face premium increases within months after the bills are signed. However, the new measures are intended to ultimately lower future premiums by reducing insurers' costs. The measures are also intended to make bad drivers pay more and let good drivers pay less.    And although the law limits what insurers are required to pay for doctors' fees, and requires co-payments from drivers, the companies still complain that there should be ceilings on the personal injury payments.    Other provisions allow consumers to either pursue injury claims in court or collect settlements from their insurers only if the afflictions fall into certain medical categories. Formerly, drivers could elect to sue in court whenever their claims exceeded $200.    The measures also seek to ease the burden on the state-operated Joint Underwriting Association, which by year end is projected to have amassed deficits of about $2.7 billion and insures about 2.4 million drivers. The measures require insurance companies to cover many of those now insured by the association. Lawmakers hope to make the association an insurer of last resort for the estimated 800,000 drivers with bad records.    New Jersey adopted no-fault auto insurance provisions in 1973 and 10 years later formed a state-operated underwriting association to cover drivers with poor records. That system was designed to lower drivers' premiums. However, premiums have been climbing steadily, and last year motorists paid a total of about $3 billion to insure some 4.4 million cars. </TEXT></DOC>
