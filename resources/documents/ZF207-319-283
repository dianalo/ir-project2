 Internet is an important communication link amongresearch centers, universities and military installations, which arescrambling to prevent damage.andM;The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories in Livermore, Calif.andP;  have beena prime target for attack.andP;  Livermore Labs discovered last year that a hackerhad been rummaging through its computer files.andP;  The intruder managed topenetrate five computers in a litter over two weeks before being locked outof the system.andP;  Officials said the files were not tampered with, but thepotential existed.andM;One difficulty in protecting Internet is that it is actually a network ofnetworks.andP;  It consists of 1,200 networks nationwide linking computersoperated by contractors, universities and other institutions.andP;  This offersmany opportunities for attack.andM;Three points need to be protected:andM;* Individual terminals, the point at which access to the network ispermitted.andM;* Local networks.andP;  Each of the 1,200 local networks can be attacked from anyaccess point in that network.andP;  For example, if the network permits dial-in,it can be penetrated from a telephone with a modem.andM;* Internet network.andP;  The master network itself can be penetrated from any ofthe local networks, or via the process that permits networks to be added ordeleted.andM;Threats Just Beginning?andM;Many experts believe we are seeing just the beginning of a major assault onInternet.andP;  A rash of break-ins followed the recent virus and worm attacks.andM;One must keep in mind that increased security is a trade-off against ease ofuse and cost.andP;  As security protection increases, the ease with whichindividuals can use the Internet decreases and the cost of operating thenetwork increases.andM;However, we appear to be in a pay-now or pay-later situation.andP;  It is thedilemma the airline industry faced some years ago.andP;  Adding securityprocedures at airports made it more difficult to fly.andP;  But the cost andinconvenience of security were insignificant compared with the cost ofhijacking, loss of equipment and potential loss of riders because of securityfears.andM;If Internet is attacked regularly, the same phenomenon could occur.andP;  Thecosts of re-creating lost files and concern over lost data will lead users tosearch for other alternatives.andP;  The cost of not increasing Internet securitymay be huge.andM;The real question, I believe, is not whether security should be increased,but how, and the cost of increasing it.andM;Any security network comprises three elements.andP;  The first is management'sphilosophy and attitude toward security; the second is how the individualsusing the network regard security; and the third is the security procedure.andO;In my opinion, the third is the least effective.andM;I would prefer to work on a network whose managers are diligent on securityand users have great concern for it, rather than one that had elaboratesecurity procedures but did not have the &quot;buy-in&quot; for security by the usersand managers.andM;Recommendations for SecurityandM;The actions I recommend are low-cost, but I think they are the mosteffective.andM;First, a network security policy should be issued.andP;  Anyone involved inInternet should understand the managers' objectives and intent to protect thenetwork.andM;The policy should deal not only with the desire for a secure network, butalso with the actions management will take toward attackers.andP;  It should stateInternet's intent to prosecute attackers to the full extent of the law, aswell as network users who, through negligence or intent, contribute to thosepenetrations.andM;Second, Internet operators should begin prosecuting all involved in networkattacks.andP;  The real value of security policy is in its implementation.andM;The attackers will look for what Internet does, not what it says.andP;  A fewcourt cases and jail sentences might cause casual hackers, who act for thesheer joy of breaking into the network, to think twice.andM;Third, Internet operators should start a training program, with moreeducation and emphasis on network security.andP;  Nothing improves security morethan a work force trained in security procedures.andM;Finally, Internet managers should pay for information leading to the captureand conviction of network attackers.andM;These recommendations will not elimitnate attacks or damage, but will make itharder to attack Internet, while minimizing security costs and inconvenience.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
