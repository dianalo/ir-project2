Hamer would rather see money spent on someplastic roof covering to save what's left of Jose Maria Alviso's old adobe.;   &quot;I question whether you could go in there without too much trepidation,&quot; hesaid.;    The home, built in the 1830s, is the only one of four adobes thatstood at Rancho Milpitas, the 4,800-acre land grant.;    Currently, it's theproperty of the Calvary Assembly of God Church. The church has more than 30acres near the intersection of Piedmont and Calaveras roads. It plans to buildnine homes on its property to offset the cost of constructing a churchcomplex.;    The city has allocated more than $800,000 for public roadimprovements that will reroute Piedmont, connecting it with Evans Road. Thatwill give the city another north-south artery.;    Dell Smith, communityservices manager, said the city hasn't spent the $800,000 yet. &quot;Nor will weuntil we get that adobe.&quot;;    &quot;We know the adobe triggers the road,&quot; said theRev. James Seregow.;    &quot;We've made it clear to them that we are anxious togive them title,&quot; he said. &quot;The only thing that's holding it up right now isthat we're trying to work out a flood control system that would be workableand affordable for everybody.&quot;;    &quot;We've asked for some financialconsideration from the city,&quot; he added.;    In December, the council -- actingas the redevelopment agency -- denied a funding request for the $675,000 floodcontrol plan -- but continues to list it as a possible future project in thecapital improvement program.;    Mike McNeely, city engineer, said, &quot;It's thechurch's responsibility,&quot; if the council does not approve the use of cityfunds. &quot;They're required to build that flood control channel.&quot;;    &quot;If we waituntil we get title, it may be too late,&quot; Hamer said.;    &quot;We should not, ascustodians of the public's funds, be in the business of protecting propertythat is not ours,&quot; said Lawson, who supported spending funds set aside forsecurity at the adobe on an expert's assessment of its condition.;    &quot;Irefuse to accept the charge that by acting in a prudent and responsible mannerthat we are destroying a building that has existed in the city for 160 years,&quot;Lawson said.;    He listed another concern: &quot;The biggest downside to that is(if) we never get the building. I have a real problem using the taxpayers'dollars on a building we don't own and may not ever own.&quot;;    Seregow wants toerase that notion immediately. &quot;We don't want the adobe. . . . As soon as thefinal map is accepted by the city, we will be glad to deed the adobe to thecity.&quot;;    The council voted 3-2 -- with Hamer and Councilwoman Barbara Lee inthe minority -- to hire a consultant.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  RICH RAMIREZ, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910327  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  536  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday March 27, 199100087258,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
