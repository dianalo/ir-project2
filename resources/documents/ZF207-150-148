Federal Maritime CommissionAutomationTariffInformation Storage and RetrievalDial-Up Lines.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>House Debates FMC's Plan for Remote RetrievalandM;It all came down to a single question: How is getting information over thetelephone any different from getting the same information in person at apublic reading room in Washington?andM;Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) officials, information industry executivesand members of the House of Representatives argued the issue at a recenthearing of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Subcommittee on MerchantMarine.andM;The FMC is planning to automate its tariff filing process, which is mostlypaper-intensive now and involves manually processing roughly 700,000 pages offilings annually.andP;  As part of the Automated Tariff Filing and Information(ATFI) system, the FMC has proposed a remote retrieval feature that wouldallow users to dial-up the system and get tariff information for a marginalfee.andM;Many industry observers said the remote retrieval option would compete withservices already available by private sector vendors.andM;&quot;It would change the nature of the government's role in the distribution ofinformation,&quot; said Ken Allen, senior vice president of government relationsfor the Information Industries Association (IIA).andP;  IIA members believe theFMC's proposal could start an avalanche in government, where agencies wouldcompete openly with industry to provide information services, he said.andM;&quot;We cannot deal with this as an isolated case,&quot; Allen said.andP;  &quot;We must look atit as a long-term policy issue.&quot;andM;If the government increasingly provides information products the compete withindustry then &quot;you're going to discourage private sector investment,&quot; Allensaid.andM;Keeping the Work PrivateandM;The Office of Management and Budget as well as the House GovernmentOperations Committee are on IIA's side.andP;  &quot;An agency, for example, may havethe capability to offer dial-up on-line access to its databases, but the samecapability may also be available from private firms that purchase theagency's databases,&quot; OMB noted in a recent draft proposal on informationdissemination.andM;&quot;For the agency to offer the service will always entail some cost to thegovernment and the availability of virtually identical services from privatefirms is a compelling argument against the need for the government to offerthe service.&quot;andM;FMC officials considered these arguments against the remote retrievalfeatures, but decided it was &quot;integral&quot; to the ATFI system, FMC chairwomanElaine L. Chao told the subcommittee.andM;Early this year, after five years of planning, the FMC released a final ATFIrequest for proposals that included a specification for a dial-up retrievalfeature.andP;  Bids are due in March and the FMC intends to make an award in July,Chao said.andP;  The agency requested $1.9 million for ATFI development costs forfiscal 1990.andM;&quot;The commission will not compete with third-party vendors,&quot; Chao said.andP;  &quot;Theservice we intend to offer is very rudimentary in nature.&quot;andM;Not all vendors are concerned.andP;  &quot;I believe other bidders will concur thatsophisticated tariff enhancement programs, which DXI and others will offer,are hardly threatened by the limited remote retrieval component of the FMC'sATFI proposal,&quot; said Robert M. Ryan, president of Data Exchange InternationalInc., a Pittsburgh-based company that provides information services to thetrade industry and intends to bid for the ATFI contract.andM;Now tariff rates appear on pages of information filed with FMC.andP;  Mostcompanies that supply automated versions of the tariff information use afull-text page format.andP;  The ATFI RFP calls for vendors to propose a databasesystem cued by tariffs not by filing page formats.andM;Even so, exporters and others who use the tariff rates usually need moreinformation than a single tariff when working on a sale or planning ashipment, Ryan said.andP;  He said ATFI is a very small piece of the automationpie existing in the maritime industry.andM;Without intervention, the ATFI procurement can move ahead.andM;But IIA called for Congress to step in and settle the debate over informationdissemination.andM;Members of the subcommittee seemed to lean toward the FMC.andP;  &quot;It seems to methe Maritime Commission is fulfilling the charge that the Congress put onthem in the Shipping Act of 1984&quot; to provide tariff information to thepublic, said Rep.andP;  Norman F. Lent (R-N.Y.).andP;  The vendors &quot;can still analyzethe information,&quot; he added.andP;  &quot;You can still put your own spin on theinformation and sell it.&quot;andM;And Rep.andP;  Herbert H. Bateman (R-Va.) concluded the information had notchanged so much and the agency was simply trying to supply it using the mostmodern technologies available.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
