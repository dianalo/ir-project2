This program shouldforesee all possible program areas and include all drilling parameters,Bottom Hole Assemblies (BHA) and individual tools. The tools alone willnot drill the hole, but with the support of operators and office personnelas well as an organized and readily retrievable pool of information,time on bottom will increase while costs decrease. Drilling technologyhas increased tremendously over the past five years. Associated withthis technological growth, unfortunately, comes an upswing in complexitythat requires know-how for proper utilization. Improper utilization willreverse the trend of cost and result in higher expenses. By efficientlyutilizing technology and preserving this knowledge in the form of a directionaldatabase, reproduction is only a page away. This new concept allows educateddecisions to be made long beforehand as well as concise immediate decisionmaking. The program is designed to make hole. Staying on bottom, eliminatingunnecessary trips and motor runs, reducing time and costs as well ashitting targets are all results of the concept. The system is an additionalengineer with expertise in hydraulics, Bottom Hole Assembly (BHA) design,MWD's, mud motors, bits and conventional as well as advanced directionaldrilling techniques. The concept has been proven very effective throughoutthe Gulf of Mexico.</TEXT></DOC>
