Milken onracketeering charges could speed settlement of a wide-rangingsecurities fraud case against his ex-bosses, but defense lawyerscall the racketeering attack an abuse of prosecutorial powers.   A 98-count federal grand jury indictment claims the DrexelBurnham Lambert Inc. financier, his brother and associate Bruce L.Newberg schemed with former speculator Ivan Boesky and others todefraud clients and investors through a range of securities lawsviolations.   The three face huge prison terms, forfeiture of $1.8 billion inpersonal assets and total fines of more than $11 billion under thefederal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations act,established in 1970 principally to combat organized crime but nowincreasingly used to prosecute white-collar criminals.   ``I think it is outrageous to use RICO in a circumstance likethis,'' said said Michael Armstrong, an attorney for Lowell Milken.``They applied the statute to behavior which for the most part hasnot been considered even to be criminal, much less the subject of aracketeering indictment.''   The indictment says Milken and the others made $244 million inillegal fees and profits by cheating clients through insidertrading, stock manipulation and ``parking'' schemes that concealthe true ownership of securities.   Some of the alleged illegal trades were used in mergers ortakeovers and to control financial markets for personal gain, theindictment says.   Charges against Milken, 42, who almost single-handedly createdthe present $175 billion high-yield bond industry, are expected tohelp resolve separate civil and criminal charges against Drexel,said one defense lawyer who asked not to be named.   Negotiations between Drexel and the Securities and ExchangeCommission to settle civil fraud charges, including insidertrading, deadlocked earlier this month when the firm balked at arequirement that it fire Milken before resolving the claims.   With the indictment, Drexel placed Milken on leave from thefirm, apparently rendering the issue moot. Once the SEC settlementis signed, Drexel is to plead guilty to six felonies and pay $650million to settle criminal fraud charges brought by the JusticeDepartment.   At issue in each case is the use of racketeering statutes andgovernment power to obtain cooperation from defendants in theprosecution of Drexel and Milken.   Drexel has said publicly it agreed to settle the criminalcharges to avoid a racketeering indictment that could have frozenits multibillion-dollar assets and crippled its operations.   As part of the pact, the nation's fifth-largest brokerage houseagreed to fire Milken and withhold his 1988 pay, estimated at up to$200 million.   In the SEC deal, the government reportedly wants to bar Milkenfrom the firm for life and prohibit Drexel employees from talkingbusiness with him.   The 110-page indictment handed up Wednesday parallels lastSeptember's SEC complaint and the government's racketeeringindictment of Princeton-Newport LP, a defunct investmentpartnership, a month earlier. Newberg, a former Drexel trader, wascharged in the case, set for trial June 5.   In that case, also cited in the Milken charges,Princeton-Newport allegedly sold securities to Drexel to concealtheir ownership and claim losses for tax purposes. Parking isn'tillegal but the government is seeking to prove it violatessecurities laws if conducted with fraudulent intent.   Indictments of other Drexel employees are expected and the grandjury investigating the firm still is calling witnesses. Defenselawyers contend the Milken charges are aimed at pressuring otherpotential defendants to cooperate and avoid charges.   ``They shouldn't be using indictments as leverage in theirpublicity campaigns and trying to induce people to talk,'' onedefense lawyer said.   A major point of contention promises to be the government'sattempt to seize under the RICO law $3.7 billion from each of thedefendants _ twice the total amount of their salaries, stockholdings and other compensation from 1984 through 1987, plusinterest.   The indictment says Milken amassed more than $1 billion in thefour years, including $550 million in 1987 compensation, as head ofDrexel's Beverly Hills, Calif.-based junk bond division, partly dueto his relationship with Boesky.   It maintains all money made by the men _ through illict tradesor not _ is tainted because it constitutes ``the proceeds of theirunlawful schemes and their interest in the racketeering enterprisecharged.'' Drexel is considered the racketeering enterprise andMichael Milken its leader.</TEXT></DOC>
