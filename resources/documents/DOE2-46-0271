It includes a description of the oil sands deposits,an outline of crude bitumen recovery and upgrading processes, the roleof Alberta Energy Company in oil sands development, environmental aspects,manpower requirements for oil sands development, research needs, andfurther oil sands projects. Presently proven recoverable reserves inthe oil sands amount to 26.5 billion bbl of synthetic crude. Productionfrom the Syncrude plant (125,000 bbl/d capacity) is expected to beginin 1977, followed by a Shell Canada operation around 1980. The provincialgovernment will participate in the oil sand industry through its jointventure participation in Syncrude and its 50% share in Alberta EnergyCompany; the latter company participates in related aspects of the Syncrudeproject, such as pipelines. The result of Alberta's participation inthe industry will mean that, directly or indirectly, the province willrealize 60% of the total profits. The job creation potential of oil sandsprojects is estimated to be extensive, with a direct and indirect workforce supported by oil sands activities possibly reaching 180,000 personsby the year 2000. Research needs have been identified, particularly inthe area of in-situ thermal recovery technology, and the creation ofthe Alberta Oil Sands Technology and Research Authority has been authorizedin order to meet these needs. Although current reserves are sufficientto support 20-30 synthetic crude plants, a number of factors will limitexpansion of the industry. 8 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
