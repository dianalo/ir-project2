(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former federal budget director Bert Lance, whoresigned amid controversy over his banking practices, says he is thevictim of an illegal and politically motivated campaign by theFederal Deposit Insurance Corp.   Lance filed his response Monday to a lawsuit filed against himlast month by the FDIC in federal court in Rome. The FDIC lawsuitseeks $1.5 million which the agency contends Lance owes to a defunctTennessee bank.   Lance charged that the FDIC, in the late 1970s, ``commenced apolicy of selectively `leaking' to the news media information about(his) personal financial situation.'' Such information ``wasconfidential and its release by the FDIC was contrary to law,'' hesaid in his response.   He asked that the lawsuit be dismissed or taken to a jury trial,and that the FDIC be forced to pay his legal fees.   The FDIC lawsuit, filed Feb. 8, contended Lance and his formerholding company owed the money because of renewal agreements forloans made with United American Bank of Knoxville, Tenn.   The Tennessee banking commissioner assumed control of UnitedAmerican Bank six years ago, and the FDIC later took over variousUAB loans, including the Lance loans.   The lawsuit listed four notes with principal balances totaling$1,247,667 and said Lance also owed interest.   Lance responded that he is under no obligation to pay the FDICanything because he had already repaid the loans. He also said theFDIC failed to deal with him in good faith and said the renewalagreements were forced on him by the FDIC.   Lance, once a Calhoun banker and Georgia's transportationcommissioner, became federal budget director after fellow GeorgianJimmy Carter was elected president in 1976. Lance resigned inSeptember 1977 after his banking practices were questioned.   Three years ago, Lance agreed to pay a fine of $50,000 and notwork at any federally insured bank in a settlement resulting fromcharges of bank fraud filed by the federal Office of the Comptrollerof the Currency.</TEXT></DOC>
