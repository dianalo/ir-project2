The May contract attracted most of the attention yesterday, ending 1.06 cents lower at $1.0697 a pound, after being down almost 5.5 cents at one point in the session. The expiring March contract settled at $1.0538 a pound, down 0.42 cent and not far above its intraday low of $1.0534 a pound. Other months, from July forward, again were down the daily permissible limit of four cents.    Prices began yesterday's session a little higher but were hit by a wave of selling that analysts attributed to margin call liquidation. The margin-related selling depressed prices to their lows, but they firmed a bit after this pressure was relieved. Active demand from dealers and merchants also helped support prices.    Monday night's collapse of the London talks to restore quotas came into clearer focus as participants returned home and said that the U.S. and Brazil were not as confrontational as it appeared during Tuesday's frantic trading. The March contract lost 16.20 cents a pound Tuesday, the biggest decline in almost 10 years.    Jon Rosenbaum, head of the U.S. delegation, insisted yesterday that the U.S. was &quot;very flexible&quot; in the London meeting of the International Coffee Organziation, offering various packages, some of which would even increase Brazil's share of the exports because of certain adjustments that could be made.    The Brazilian delegation came to the conference with strict orders to retain the quotas that were in place at the time they were suspended early last year, sources said. While willing to accept a temporary shortfall, the delegation wasn't free to negotiate a new system of allocations, according to sources.    According to Mr. Rosenbaum and at least one other member of the U.S. delegation, the head of the Brazilian delegation, Jorio Dauster, told consuming nation representatives he could not negotiate new quotas &quot;even if you offered me 32%&quot; of a new quota system, compared with the 30% share of exports under the quotas that were suspended a year ago. Brazil has defended that share, even in years when its supplies and shipments were low.    Some people familiar with the talks said Mr. Dauster's mandate was limited because he was just recently appointed to the job as president of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, although he has been head of the institute's London office, and because the country has revamped its regulatory structure for coffee.    Mr. Rosenbaum said he wanted to correct the impression that the U.S. was trying to cut Brazil's share of the quotas. &quot;We're not going after any specific nation to cut its export quota,&quot; he said. &quot;What we want is for quotas to be distributed by an objective system rather than being determined by Brazil and, say, Colombia.&quot;    Mr. Rosenbaum added that he conferred with the eight dissenting producing countries that also supported objective criteria. &quot;We asked them if we should change our position -- not for the purpose of changing if they said yes -- but to see how they felt about it, and they said we should not,&quot; he said.    He acknowledged that depressed prices could cause some Latin American nations to put pressure on the U.S. to soften its stand, but he said the U.S. is already flexible and is willing to discuss the quota issue again, as soon as the producers want.    In other futures markets yesterday:    STOCK INDEXES: Futures prices advanced strongly from the opening bell and climbed throughout the day on a surge of buying from U.S. and foreign investors. &quot;The GM share buyback announcement catapulted the market forward, and the rally in oil prices gave the oil stocks a boost,&quot; said J.R. Fredericks, an analyst with E. David Stephens Commodity Corp. &quot;There is really no alternative for investment dollars except the U.S. stock and bond markets,&quot; he added. Mr. Fredericks said that several analysts were pegging 293.00 as a near-term price objective for the Standard andamp; Poor's 500 stock-index contract for March delivery. The contract closed up 4.90 at 289.00 yesterday. Mr. Fredericks said the only big negative factor overshadowing the market is the possibility that the Iran-Iraq war could escalate further. Arbitrage-related trading between stocks and stock-index futures wasn't a major factor fueling the rally, said Gerald Walsh, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. He said that a number of institutional investors took advantage of the rally to &quot;roll&quot; their futures positions from the March to the June contract. They made such trades to avoid any possible negative impact from the next quarterly &quot;triple witching hour&quot; March 20, when stock-index futures, options and options on individual stocks expire concurrently.    ENERGY: Oil prices rose on spot and futures markets for the second consecutive day as traders focused on attempts by the oil cartel to keep its official price system intact. A price-committee meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries planned for early April was indefinitely postponed, for example, suggesting to some traders that the strains on the cartel's recent agreement had eased somewhat. The move &quot;allows the cartel to take a little breather, and shows it's not as desperate&quot; as it had been when prices recently skidded, said Richard Marose, oil futures broker for Stotler andamp; Co., Chicago. Said Peter Beutel, assitant director of the energy group at Elders Futures Inc., New York, &quot;The oil market has given OPEC another vote of confidence.&quot; April crude oil contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after rising to an intraday high of $17.75, closed at $17.51 a barrel, up 16 cents for the day. That followed a gain of almost $1 a barrel Tuesday. Heating oil and unleaded gasoline futures prices also rose. The spot, or noncontract, price of West Texas Intermediate, a closely watched gauge of U.S. oil prices, rose 15 cents, to $17.50 a barrel. Reflecting the gains of the past two days, Sun Co.'s Sun Refining andamp; Marketing Co. unit raised the price it pays for West Texas Intermediate crude $1 a barrel to $17. But while the follow-through oil market buying suggested to some analysts that trader sentiment had shifted from the widespread bearishness of last week, others weren't convinced. &quot;I don't think there's a whole lot of upside potential left,&quot; said John Hill, a vice president at Merrill Lynch Futures Inc., New York. Said one Chicago-based trader: &quot;The one thing you can say for sure is that there's no clear-cut intermediate-term direction for oil prices.&quot;    INTEREST RATES: Treasury bond futures prices closed sharply higher on buying from professional and retail investors. Also driving the market were purchases made to cover short sales executed earlier in the week in anticipation of a market decline, said Jeffrey Priest, a trader at Miller, Tabak, Hirsch andamp; Co. in New York. The Treasury bond futures contract for June delivery closed up 1 3/32 at 101 3/8. &quot;The psychology of the market is still for a weak economy and low inflation . . . an increase in car sales and oil prices didn't seem to matter,&quot; said Joseph Belanoff, a trader at Moseley Securities Corp. He also said that bond traders are anticipating that employment numbers for February, to be released tomorrow, will be relatively weak. </TEXT></DOC>
