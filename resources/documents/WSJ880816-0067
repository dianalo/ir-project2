The government said retail sales climbed 2% in July from June and 6.5% from a year earlier. Analysts had forecast a month-to-month increase of only 0.5%.    The government also announced that industrial production fell a provisional 0.9% in June from May but advanced 4.7% from a year earlier. Analysts had predicted that industrial production would show a small rise in June from the previous month. The decline indicates manufacturers in the United Kingdom may face capacity constraints, another worrisome sign of inflationary pressure.    Stocks fell in London in reaction to the figures, and the pound tumbled before recovering to near Friday's levels.    The British central bank last week prompted commercial banks to raise their base rates half a percentage point to 11%, the seventh increase since early June, in an effort to restrain inflation, which is currently running at 4.6%.    Analysts yesterday focused mostly on the increase in retail sales, because provisional industrial-production figures often are revised later. Both sets of figures are seasonally adjusted.    The retail-sales increase &quot;is going to be taken as another sign that {British officials} are going to keep looking at their monetary controls,&quot; said Jeremy Evans, a market analyst at London stockbrokers County NatWest WoodMac Ltd.    But economists suggested monetary officials may wait another month before deciding whether to direct a further increase in base rates. That's because the gradual rise in base rates from 7.5% in early June wouldn't have affected July retail sales much. Officials first may check August's retail sales to see if monetary conditions have tightened sufficiently to slow sales growth, economists said.    &quot;We had anticipated there would be a number of bad numbers coming out of the U.K. before we got improvement,&quot; said Evelyn Brodie, senior United Kingdom economist at London investment bankers Morgan Grenfell andamp; Co. The likelihood of a rise soon in base rates depends on &quot;whether the government has got the stomach to watch more bad figures coming out, or panics into a further interest-rate increase,&quot; she added.    But Ian Amstad, a London-based economist at Chase Manhattan Securities, said British officials &quot;will be wary about going for overkill. Interest rates have a powerful effect on the economy. They could ratchet up inflation&quot; by prompting higher mortgage rates, he said.    Economists said there may be further signs of inflationary pressure Thursday, when the government announces unit labor costs for June and July's money supply and bank-lending volumes. On Friday, the government will report July's retail-price index, the main measure of inflation. </TEXT></DOC>
