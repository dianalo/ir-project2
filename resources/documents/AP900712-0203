But less than half of the U.S. output is used domestically,meaning that the financial well-being of wheat farmers dependsheavily on the export market.   Also, production is being stepped up in other countries,including some of the biggest U.S. export competitors. Productionin the Soviet Union and China _ two huge markets for U.S. wheat _also is increasing this year.   Globally, says Sara Schwartz of USDA's Economic ResearchService, wheat production is expected to exceed consumption for thefirst time since 1987-88, meaning ``a modest recovery'' in worldinventories during 1990-91.   That translates into lower wheat prices and an increase in worldwheat trading, including more for livestock feeding.   Schwartz and colleague Pete Riley said in the July issue ofAgricultural Outlook magazine that many livestock feeders aroundthe world will turn more heavily to wheat as tight supplies of cornand other coarse grains bolster prices of traditional feed supplies.   Major U.S. competitors will have larger exportable supplies ofwheat because of bigger crops this year, reflecting favorableweather across much of northern Europe, improved moistureconditions in the Canadian spring wheat areas and good plantingconditions in Argentina and parts of Australia.   Another reason will be the anticipated increase in the amount ofwheat imported for livestock feeding. The bulk of U.S. exports ishigher-quality wheat used for milling into flour and other foodproducts.   ``Competitors, especially the European Community (EC), havehistorically been the major suppliers of wheat for feeding andprobably will be the beneficiaries of increased trade in the comingyear,'' the report said.   Schwartz, in a telephone interview Wednesday, said the generaloutlook described in the report continues to hold up withoutsignificant recent changes.   ``The weather seems to be pretty good,'' she said. ``There stillseems to be some questions about dryness in the EC, but that wouldaffect spring crops more than their winter wheat.''   Looking at the four major wheat competitors, the report saidwheat production in the 12-nation EC is expected to be the secondlargest on record, with yield increases most notable in France andthe United Kingdom.   Canada is forecast to boost wheat output sharply in 1990-91. Thereport said Canadian farmers have few production alternatives, and``planting conditions are better than last year.''   Although prices are down from 1989-90, those still are expectedto make wheat attractive to producers.   In Australia, wheat production is expected to be down from lastseason because of lower yields, the report said. Sheep productioncompetes with wheat for land, but wool prices recently droppedsharply and there are large stockpiles.   ``Even though world wheat prices are likely to fall in 1990-91,the relative change in prices between wheat and wool is makingwheat more attractive to some producers,'' the report said.``Moreover, depreciation of the Australian dollar likely willcushion Australian producers from the slide in prices.''   Argentina, the fourth major U.S. wheat competitor, is expectedto increase production, although there is uncertainty because ofinflation and farm costs.   But the Argentine government has reduced export taxes on grain,hoping to boost plantings, although it is unclear what effect thismight have on acreages.   ``Despite these uncertainties, many Argentine farmers,especially those who double-crop soybeans, probably need the incomethat wheat provides and likely will plant as much or more wheatthan a year ago,'' the report said.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Agriculture Department has expandedfederal quarantine restrictions to control fire ants in all orparts of six Southern states.   The quarantine is being expanded to keep up with the spread ofthe pests in Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, South Carolina,Tennessee and Texas.   Other areas where federal quarantine restrictions continueunchanged include Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina,Oklahoma and Puerto Rico.   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal andPlant Health Inspection Service, said the restrictions are on theinterstate movement of ``certain goods and equipment to prevent theartificial spread'' of the imported fire ant into uninfested areas.   ``For example, nursery stock is treated before being shippedfrom infested areas to be sure it isn't harboring the ants,'' hesaid.   The imported fire ant builds large mounds in fields andpastures, the agency said.   Fire ants can damage certain crops, and the stings are painfulto livestock, pets and people, not only on farms but also in thesuburbs and cities of infested areas.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Agriculture Department is seeingvolunteers for a trade mission to Ireland this fall.   Duane Acker, administrator of the department's Office ofInternational Cooperation and Development, said about 20 mostlysmall to medium-size Irish companies have expressed interest injoint cooperation in marketing and specialized food processingtechnology.   Areas of interest include wood, dairy and confectionaryproducts, beef, pork and frozen food processing; smoked fish,specialty and convenience foods, and trading and wholesale foodservice distribution.   Participants will have to pay their travel, lodging and mealexpenses. Selection of U.S. companies, scheduling of appointmentsand side trips will be made by the agency.
