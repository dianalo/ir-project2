We must accommodate the political aspirations of the blacks.&quot; One of the sharpshooters slaps the pistol on his hip and fires back, &quot;We recognize the reality, too. That's why we're out here practicing.&quot;    Not far from the gun club, at a house meeting of middle-class Afrikaners, Fritz Meyer, a candidate for the far right Conservative Party, also acknowledges South Africa's reality. His answer, and the siren call of his party, is to tighten the country's racial segregation laws known as apartheid. &quot;This election is our last chance to save all that is dear to us,&quot; he tells his rapt audience. &quot;It's either partnership {with blacks} or partition. We say that good fences make good neighbors.&quot;    In still another part of the vast North Rand constituency, Attie Grobler, the present member of Parliament for the ruling National Party, carefully straddles both sides of reality. He assures a gathering of senior citizens that they have nothing to fear from the government's promises of a &quot;new South Africa,&quot; a hazy constitutional nether world designed to accommodate the political needs of the disenfranchised black majority without surrendering white minority privilege and control. If the seniors don't want to integrate their retirement home, they don't have to, Mr. Grobler explains. But if they want to, they can. &quot;We can all work together,&quot; he says, smiling broadly.    Three men, three parties, three visions of the future. The deep polarization of white society is on full display in North Rand, a mixture of rich and poor, urban and rural, redneck and &quot;yuppie&quot; between Johannesburg and Pretoria. Here, Mr. Grobler, who won the seat with a narrow majority in 1987, is up against intense assaults from the left and right. So divided is white opinion that all three men are equally confident of victory.    Similarly, the National Party countrywide is facing its toughest election since it came to power in 1948 and began laying the foundation of apartheid. Currently, the Nats, as they are known, have 123 seats in the 166-seat white Parliament. But some party leaders are worried that the number could fall below 100, with overall support shrinking to less than 50%.    Conceding that the Conservatives will make gains on the right, the Nats have concentrated on holding the center and the moderate left. The government's main argument of this election is that it can best represent white interests in negotiations with black leaders, which both the National and Democratic parties see as inevitable.    For the first time, the government is looking left, abandoning anti-reformist elements for a white majority coalescing around the need for some kind of negotiation. How far those negotiations go will determine whether this is South Africa's last apartheid election.    Democratic Party    First up for Mr. de Waal on a Saturday of campaigning is a yard full of English-speaking yuppies. Although he is a 38-year-old Afrikaner, Mr. de Waal, as an executive of a car rental company, shares their concerns. &quot;In 1970, I remember standing next to my father as he bought his first Mercedes for 5,300 rand,&quot; he says. &quot;Today, that same car retails for 155,000 rand {about $60,000}.&quot;    The yuppies groan. But their spirits improve when Mr. de Waal tells them the Democratic Party can end South Africa's international isolation, and thus relieve the economic sanctions pushing up the Mercedes price, by scrapping apartheid legislation and sharing power with blacks.    He hits another sensitive yuppie nerve: emigration. Mr. de Waal says that in 1984 he received an offer to move to the U.S. and, eventually, to become a U.S. citizen. It was tempting, he says, but he turned it down.    &quot;This is where my heart lies. I'm not going anywhere,&quot; he says in Afrikaans. One of the yuppies says he sounds just like a Nat, which, in fact, he was before signing up with the Democrats. Mr. de Waal laughs. &quot;The time has come,&quot; he says, &quot;for all of us with different views to stand up and say we belong here, too.&quot;    At the gun club, the candidate runs into trouble with his party's vision of federalism, which divides the country into nine federations where everybody, regardless of color, has a vote in a system of proportional representation. &quot;Surely,&quot; says a man dressed in camouflage, &quot;there will be an education qualifier to the vote.&quot;    Mr. de Waal shakes his head. &quot;There's no soft option,&quot; he says. &quot;We must start bringing people together, and we must start now.&quot;    Conservative Party    Mr. Meyer's house meeting begins with a prayer for wisdom and strength and for the Lord's blessing on the task at hand. Then Mr. Meyer, a 25-year-old computer programmer, launches into his campaign sermon, delivered with evangelic fervor.    &quot;Our policy isn't racism,&quot; he says. &quot;Our policy is love. Love for our land, our volk {people}, our children, our language.&quot; The Conservatives' policy of partition, he explains, is born of love. Every population group, defined by race, should have the right to occupy its own territory under its own government.    He scoffs at his opponents' calls for negotiation. Remember Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and Namibia, he warns. Politically negotiated solutions in those neighboring countries, he says, have opened the door for &quot;black, Marxist, terrorist&quot; governments. &quot;We have the same choice here,&quot; he says. &quot;The Conservative Party won't negotiate over our fatherland.&quot;    The audience, 11 men and three women, nod in approval. One of them complains that the whites are going broke subsidizing improvements in black residential areas. &quot;I don't hate their culture,&quot; says the man. &quot;I just don't like paying for it.&quot;    Mr. Meyer shares his dismay. &quot;White taxes for white people,&quot; he says.    More nods. More fears: someone worries that government plans for &quot;free settlement areas,&quot; where people of all races can live together, will ruin property values.    &quot;This is a white area, it always has been a white area,&quot; Mr. Meyer assures the group. &quot;If they make it a free settlement area against our wishes, we'll take the law into our own hands.&quot;    National Party    Mr. Grobler praises the senior citizens, loyal Nats for 40 years, as the backbone of the National Party and asks for their support one more time. Retirement homes are prime hunting territory for the Conservative Party, and Mr. Grobler has come to stop the poaching.    One elderly man, his voice breaking with emotion, reports that a Conservative convasser came to the home and asked him how he would like it if a black or colored person suddenly moved in. Mr. Grobler smiles and shakes his head. &quot;This is one of their scare tactics,&quot; he says. &quot;Free settlement areas won't happen overnight. It won't happen at all unless the residents allow it.&quot;    There is uneasiness among the seniors; one says the National Party isn't the same party they grew up with. Before, no Nat worth his salt would have ever spoken of free settlement areas or negotiations with blacks. Mr. Grobler, a 42-year-old career civil servant, explains that the party must be more flexible.    Thus, he says, the Nats will allow multiracial private schools, but state schools will remain whites-only. The government will negotiate with black leaders, but not with those who won't renounce violence. And it will negotiate a new constitution, but it won't ever agree to the Democratic Party's position of one man, one vote.    Change is difficult to accept, he admits, but the Nats, and South Africa, are running out of time. &quot;We mustn't forget there is still a lot of good will among the blacks,&quot; he says. &quot;But the longer we wait, the more radical the moderates will become.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
