Arnold McKinnon, chairman of the Norfolk, Va.-based railroad holding company, told analysts here that the one-time charge resulted in a third-quarter net loss of $248.5 million. But he said he expects Norfolk Southern will soon realize savings in depreciation, maintenance and wages.    Without the special charge, Norfolk Southern said net would have been $103.3 million, or 55 cents a share, a 19% decline from earnings of $127.8 million, or 68 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Last year, third-quarter results included an after-tax gain of $16.4 million on the sale of Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. stock. Revenue for the quarter rose 2.5% to $1.03 billion from $1.00 billion.    The program follows more ambitious streamlining efforts made by other large railroad companies in recent years. Union Pacific Corp., a New York-based railroad, natural resources and energy concern, last year announced a major restructuring and took a one-time charge of $945 million. Such programs reflect the pressure to cut costs and compete for freight following the partial deregulation of transportation in 1980.    &quot;Norfolk Southern didn't have quite the excess capacity of other railroads, so the company was under less pressure to do this,&quot; said Andras Petery, analyst at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. He added that the program &quot;sets Norfolk Southern up for earnings gains in what could be a very difficult year in 1988.&quot;    Norfolk Southern said $95 million of the $620 million pretax charge reflects an increase in its reserves against casualty claim liability.    The majority of the special charge reflects the restructuring program, including $210 million for disposition of unproductive assets and $315 million for work force reductions. Mr. McKinnon said under the program Norfolk Southern will sell or abandon about 2,700 miles of its total 15,000 miles of railroad lines.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Norfolk Southern shares closed at $23.50, up $1.    Norfolk Southern plans to eliminate about 5,000 jobs by the end of 1990 through voluntary severance programs, adding that it can do so without changing the basic union work rules and manning requirements that govern rail operations. Mr. McKinnon said the reductions include about 1,200 employees who have already indicated they plan to accept a previous offer for early retirement.    The company currently has more than 31,000 employees. The work force reductions would lower Norfolk Southern's costs by about $78 million in 1988, and between $115 million and $143 million annually by 1990.    But some analysts doubt that the company will be able to cut back that far. Noting that most industrial employers don't pay as well as railroads, Jeffrey Stone, analyst at Wertheim Schroder andamp; Co., said, &quot;There's declining incentive for rail-road employees to accept voluntary severance offers.&quot; Mr. Stone added that some rail-roads have not been able to spend all the money they have reserved for voluntary buy-outs.    Norfolk Southern said the special charge resulted in a $1.3 million net loss for the nine months. Net income without the special charge would have been $350.5 million, or $1.85 a share, a 6.4% decline from earnings of $374.5 million, or $1.98 a share, for the year-earlier period. Results for the latest nine months include an aftertax gain of $32.8 million from the sale of 2.3 million shares of Piedmont Aviation stock. Revenue declined less than 1% to $3.05 billion.    Norfolk Southern said that stiff competition in freight transportation is holding down rates in both its rail and truck units, which has resulted in lower profit.    Mr. McKinnon said Norfolk Southern's freight business, particularly coal, has been &quot;relatively good&quot; in recent months and &quot;we anticipate traffic volume to be fairly strong in the fourth quarter.&quot; Other Norfolk Southern officials said they haven't seen any sign that freight shipments have been slowed by the stock market crash. </TEXT></DOC>
