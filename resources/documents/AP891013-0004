STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   East Germany's Communist Party today ruled outtalks with pro-democracy activists and labeled one growingopposition group ``enemies of the socialist order.''   The government had promised discussions to cope with risingunrest and to seek the causes of a refugee exodus, saying it wouldtalk to representatives of ``all parts of society.''   But in an internal Communist Party position paper obtained byThe Associated Press, party leaders warned that ``open and hiddenenemies of the socialist order'' could create a mass movement atodds with the socialist government.   ``Any association with such opposition groups would hurt thefurther development of socialism,'' the position paper said.   The document was directed primarily at the opposition group NewForum, which has advocated free elections, greater openness insociety and a free press.   It said New Forum's platform was ``aimed at destroying theleadership role of the Socialist society'' and accused the group ofbeing made up of ``enemies of the socialist order.''   On Thursday, the chief ideologue of the Communist Party, KurtHager, indicated the opposition movement would be excluded from anydiscussions about political reform.   Hager promised during a visit to Moscow that the East Germangovernment will consider changes following the departure of tens ofthousands of citizens to the West and the most widespread publicdemonstrations since 1953.   But his reference to possible talks with public organizations,church groups and other social forces did not appear to include theopposition movement.   He said those challenging the foundations of socialism wouldhave no role in the talks.   ``If they want to question our social order, then that's not abasis for discussions,'' said Hager, who was in Moscow for theopening of a cultural exhibition.   The communist government here routinely has accused the majoropposition groups of trying to undermine socialism.   The future of hard-line leader Erich Honecker, meanwhile,remained a subject of widespread speculation. Party sources havesaid influential members of the ruling Politburo were upset overthe way the 77-year-old Honecker has responded to the unrest.   Party sources said he had been asked to provide a report on the``critical situation'' of the nation before the end of this week.   West Germany's mass-circulation Bild newspaper, quotingunidentified Communist Party sources, reported Thursday thatHonecker would be replaced on Oct. 18.   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev visited East Berlin overthe weekend to help East Germany celebrate its 40th anniversary andurged Honecker to undertake reforms.   Tens of thousands of East Germans demonstrated in several citiesand demanded political and economic reform; many asked thereform-minded Gorbachev for his help.   Lutheran Church sources in East Berlin said late Thursday thatofficials in Leipzig were preparing to give amnesty to all thosearrested in protests there since Sept. 11. The number was notimmediately known, but up to 500 people are believed still to be injail.   The Politburo promised Wednesday to examine the causes of theprotests and the recent exodus of tens of thousands of young,skilled East Germans to the West.   Opposition leaders Thursday said they were skeptical about thegovernment's professed willingness to enter into real dialogue withany social forces.   Baerbel Bohley, an East Berlin painter and a co-founder of theopposition group New Forum, described the Politburo statement as a``verbal shift that does not take into account real life.''   East German leaders have made it clear that any changes wouldoccur only within the framework of the existing socialist system.   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwilerwelcomed the East German offer of a dialogue but said it ``shouldbe meaningful and not just a tactical move to relieve domestic andinternational pressure.''   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief of staff, RudolfSeiters, said Kohl was optimistic.   ``This could be the first positive signal to the populace thatthe East German leadership has given,'' Seiters said of thePolitburo statement. ``But we must wait to see what concretemeasures it carries.''   The government in East Berlin has rejected pro-democracy reformslike those taking place in the Soviet bloc countries of Poland andHungary.</TEXT></DOC>
