In a decision issued Friday, the U.S. Court of Appeals here saidthe department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration ``hasfailed adequately to explain'' its determination that the exposurelimit for formaldehyde it set in 1987 made the cancer riskinsignificant.   The court also said OSHA had offered a ``feeble'' explanation ofits decision not to include in its standard for formaldehydeexposure provisions guaranteeing workers will be paid full wages andretain seniority rights during rehabilitation from any illnesslinked to the substance.   The court, ruling in a suit filed by several unions, upheldOSHA's decision not to require employers to provide annual medicalexaminations to workers who are exposed to formaldehyde, a colorlessgas that when mixed with other materials has a number ofapplications in industry and is found in numerous construction andconsumer products.   Simple monitoring of employees who are exposed to the substanceand medical checkups if they develop skin or eye irritations andother symptoms caused by formaldehyde exposure are enough to protectworkers, the court said.   Also upheld was the OSHA-set exposure ``action level'' at whichemployers are required to provide workers with training, protectiveclothing and other measures for protection. The unions failed toshow that lowering that level would significantly enhance workersafety, the court said.   An OSHA spokesman said agency officials were reviewing thedecision and had no immediate comment.   OSHA, revising a 1972 standard, in 1987 set a maximum permissibleexposure level of 1 part per million of formaldehyde during aneight-hour workday and set the action level at 0.5 ppm.   A number of unions challenged the standard, saying OSHA shouldhave set a far more stringent exposure limit.   The court, in returning to the Labor Department the question ofcancer risk, questioned the formula used by the department toextrapolate the cancer risk to humans from the risk found in animalstudies.   The court also dismissed OSHA's contention that it did notinclude provisions protecting the earnings and seniority of workersdisabled by formaldehyde because it did not believe those workerscould ever return to their old jobs.   The court said in other instances the agency had providedearnings protection until a disabled worker was retrained foranother job, citing provisions applying to coal dust and leadexposure.   When it released the revised standard in 1987, OSHA said it wouldhelp protect 2.2 million workers at an annual cost to industry ofmore than $60 million. Employers who cannot reduce formaldehyde toacceptable levels in the air have to provide respirators to workers.</TEXT></DOC>
