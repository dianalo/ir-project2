On October 3, 1988, the National Exchange Carrier Association (NECA)proposed revisions to the interstate average schedules. The revisions werefiled in response to an order released December 21, 1987 (the 1987 Order)that declined to accept proposed revisions to the average schedules filedby NECA on June 30, 1987. The 1987 Order directed NECA to file amendedrevisions that brought the average schedules into conformance with changesin Parts 32, 36, and 69 of the Commission's rules, revised cost allocationrules, and changes in the Tax Reform Act of 1986.2. NECA stated that its October 1988 proposal was based on a newly completedstatistical sample of cost and average schedule companies that reflectedupdated data and complied with the Commission rule requiring that the averageschedules simulate the disbursements received by comparable cost companies.NECA stated that it revised the average schedules, as the Bureau requiredin the 1987 Order, to adjust for the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the adoptionof a new Part 32 Uniform System of Accounts (USOA), new part 36 Separationsprocedures, USOA conformance changes, new rate base rules, and the jointcost rules. NECA also stated that it adopted a new formula structure forthe reimbursement of CABS and access administration costs that was consistentwith the 1987 order.3. NECA contended that since June 1986, when its last revisions becameeffective, significant industry changes had resulted in a shift in costrecovery away from the interstate jurisdiction, and the revised schedulesreflect a total annual settlement reduction of about $49 million, or anoverall 10.5% reduction in average schedule settlements. NECA determinedthat this reduction in settlements should be phased in over a two-yeartransition period. NECA also proposed a new distance-sensitive line haulfacility formula based on new statistical data.4. The Bureau approved the proposed schedule revisions, agreeing with thevast majority of commenters that the proposed revisions were an improvementover the existing schedules. The Bureau found that that proposed revisionscomplied with the Bureau's directive that NECA conform the schedules toreflect recent regulatory changes, and rejected challenges to NECA's newcommon line and distance sensitive line haul formulas. The Bureau alsofound that a two year transition plan was appropriate to allow companiesto adjust to reductions in settlements. However, the Bureau directed NECAto modify its schedules so that no company experienced average monthlysettlements over the fifteen month expected life of the average schedulesin excess of 10% over current settlement levels. The Bureau rejected severalalternative transition plans as unjustified and unduly expensive.5. The final, approved settlement schedules are as follows:(A) Common Line Basic Formula(1) For access lines per exchange less than 385.55, the settlement peraccess line per month would be: $12.982078 ^ ($.015532 andmultiply; AccessLines Per Exchange).(2) For access lines per exchange greater than or equal to 385.55, thesettlement per access line per month would be $6.993457.(B) Traffic Sensitive Central OfficeThe settlement per minute per month would be $.030216 + ($191.497493/MinutesPer Exchange).(C) Intertoll Switching (B6)The settlement per month per trunk would be $29.18.(D) Line Haul Switched Circuit Termination (Non-Distance Sensitive)The settlement per month would be $34.05 per termination.(E) Line Haul Facility (Distance Sensitive)The settlement per month would be ($1.165293 andmultiply; Interstate CircuitMiles) + ($0.001554 andmultiply; TS Minutes per month).(F) Special AccessSettlement = .939959 andmultiply; Revenues.(G) CABS and AdministrativeSettlement = $385.90 + ($.000486 andmultiply; TS Minutes).<ITAG tagnum="84">Ordering Clause</ITAG>6. <T3>Accordingly it is ordered, </T3>pursuant to the authority that is containedin andSection;andSection; 0.91 and 69.606(a) of the Commission's rules, 47CFR 0.91 and 69.606(a), that the revisions to the average schedules thathave been proposed by the National Exchange Carrier Association <T3>are provided </T3>subject to the conditions described herein.<ITAG tagnum="20">Federal Communications Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Gerald Brock,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Chief, Common Carrier Bureau.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-11562 Filed 5-12-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6712-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
