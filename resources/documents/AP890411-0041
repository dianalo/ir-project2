(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Motorists who kill deer alongMassachusetts' roads may keep the meat or donate it to theirfavorite charity under new state wildlife regulations.   ``It seems a shame to see it just wasted,'' Steve Williams, awildlife biologist in charge of the state's deer managementprogram, said Monday before the state Division of Wildlife andFisheries board approved the change.   ``A deer can do thousands of dollars of damage to a car and themeat can provide some compensation,'' he said.   Williams said that 600 to 700 deer are reported killed on thestate's highways annually, but officials suspect the toll is threetimes higher.   ``Some go off into the woods to die and some just end up in thetrunk of the car,'' said Walter Bickford, commissioner of fisheriesand wildlife.   Under the new rule, the driver or a passenger could keep thevenison only if they are residents of Massachusetts.   ``We don't want to get involved in transporting road killsacross state lines,'' said Ellie Horowitz, a spokeswoman for thedivision.   The change was sparked in part by the state EnvironmentalPolice's decision in October to stop picking up animal carcasses,leaving the problem to municipalities. Bickford said budget cutsforced police to stop the service.</TEXT></DOC>
