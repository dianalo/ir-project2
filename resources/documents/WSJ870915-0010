LeeStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 09/15/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> UK FRESTCHEMICALS, PLASTICS (CHM) </IN><TEXT>   The judge in the Bhopal poison-gas case urged Union Carbide Corp. and the Indian government to reach an out-of-court settlement by Oct. 30 to pay victims of the December 1984 disaster.    In Bhopal, India, District Court Judge M.W. Deo said he made the request because both parties indicated they want to settle. Oct. 30 is the next scheduled court hearing for the case.    In Danbury, Conn., Union Carbide said lawyers for both sides told the judge they are &quot;earnestly seeking a compromise that they hope will lead to a just and reasonable settlement of the Bhopal case.&quot; A spokesman declined further comment on any settlement negotiations.    Bruce Finzen, a Minneapolis lawyer representing Indian government interests in the Bhopal case, said, &quot;The government's position remains the same: a fair and reasonable settlement on behalf of each and every victim.&quot; Mr. Finzen declined to comment on any settlement figure. The New Delhi government is seeking some $3 billion in damages from Union Carbide.    As previously reported, most legal and financial observers speculate that the case is likely to be settled in the range of $400 million to $600 million.    The case was filed after a gas leak at a Union Carbide pesticide plant in Bhopal killed at least 2,500 people and injured tens of thousands more.    Last month, Union Carbide offered to contribute about $4.6 million in interim aid to the gas victims, in response to a earlier request for interim victim assistance from Judge Deo.    About $1.6 million of that amount represents the proceeds from dividends the company has earned on its Indian subsidiary's stock since the incident. The chemical company also said last month it was prepared to authorize the American Red Cross to send about $3 million to the court. Union Carbide paid the funds to the relief agency in December 1985.    Mr. Finzen said the Indian government hasn't yet formally responded to Union Carbide's interim-aid offer. But he said that at the time it was made, the government said it didn't think it was sufficient. </TEXT></DOC>
