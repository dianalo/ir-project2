The age of uranium miners with lung cancer was 36{similar_to}61with an average of 48.8, nine years earlier than that of the controlgroup (57.3). In the uranium miner patients the right lung was more susceptibleto cancer than the left, the ratio being 2.5:1. However, in the controlgroup the right lung had an equal incidence of cancer as the left lung.The relative frequency of small cell anaplastic carcinoma in uraniumminer was higher than that in the control group. In the miner patientsthe mean occupation history was 11.1 +- 5.2 years; the exposure doseto radon and its daughters in 50% patients was 0.504J(120 WLM). The etiologicfactor of lung cancer in uranium miners is strongly attributed, in additionto smoking, to the exposure to radon and its daughters in uranium mines.</TEXT></DOC>
