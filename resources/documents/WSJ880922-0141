Midi, a French holding company, didn't offer a denial. Officials of the company confirmed that they held discussions with Mr. De Benedetti, but they said these talks centered on a possible transaction between Midi and Cia. Latina di Assicurazioni, another De Benedetti holding company that groups most of his insurance, finance and real-estate interests.    Sources familiar with the talks maintained that the two sides also discussed some form of swap under which Midi would take over part or all of Mr. De Benedetti's 16% stake in Generale de Belgique, in exchange for an unspecified holding in Midi. As reported, they said these talks weren't very advanced and that the publication of yesterday's article could scotch any transaction between Midi and Mr. De Benedetti.    Financial sources said they expected the article to be denied because it put both Mr. De Benedetti and Midi in a delicate position. The discussions, they said, show that Mr. De Benedetti is prepared to shed his stake in Generale de Belgique, while as vice chairman of the company, he is participating in defining its strategy. The talks also could have been perceived by Midi's biggest shareholder, Axa-Midi Assurances, as a hostile move designed to counterbalance its influence, the sources said. </TEXT></DOC>
