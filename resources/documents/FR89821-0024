Background</T3>  </ITAG><T3>FAC 84-51, Item I. </T3>26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M contain variousreporting requirements that direct Federal agencies to transmit informationto the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). FAR subpart 4.9 and correspondingcoverage in part 52 were developed to provide for contractors to submittheir taxpayer identification number and certain related information tothe appropriate contracting officer in order for Federal contracting agenciesto comply with the reporting requirements.  As a result of public comments FAR coverage was revised to add a requirementthat the copy of the contract sent to the paying office contain the appropriateinformation for the paying office to prepare necessary returns to the IRS.The definition of ``common parent'' was revised to comport with the draftIRS regulations. The provision at 52.204-3 was clarified to reflect thatno Taxpayer Identification Number needs to be submitted where the offeroris an agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government.  <T3>FAC 84-51, Item VII. </T3>This final rule is issued by the Departmentof Defense, the General Services Administration, and the National Aeronauticsand Space Administration to make revisions to the FAR cost principles regardingthe termination of defined pension benefit plans. The <T4>Federal Register </T4>of February 9, 1987 (52 FR 4082) contained theproposed cost principle rules.  The proposed rule predicated the Government's share of the refund uponthe ratio of all Government business to all business of the contractorover the ten-year period prior to the plan termination. As a result ofpublic comments received, the final rule requires the Government's equitableshare to be based upon only those Government contracts requiring certifiedcost or pricing data.  <T3>FAC 84-51, Item XII. </T3>Currently, there is no explicit requirementthat a demand for payment be made concurrently with issuance of the finaldecision. This change is intended to clarify the policy of the Governmentconcerning demands for payment so that interest will be charged on contractualdebts due to the Government at the earliest practicable time.  <ITAG tagnum="84">B. Regulatory Flexibility Act  </ITAG><T3>FAC 84-51, Items I, VI, VII, XI, and XII. </T3>DoD, GSA, and NASA certifythat these final rules in FAC 84-51 will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) because_  <T3>Item I. </T3>All taxpayers are required to have a Taxpayer IdentificationNumber (TIN), and this rule merely requests that contractors provide thatnumber. No comments were received on the interim rule from small entitieswith respect to the impact on small businesses.  <T3>Item VI. </T3>Most prime contracts, as well as subcontracts with smallentities, do not require the submission of cost or pricing data. Publiccomments on the possible impact on small entities were sought and nonewere received.  <T3>Item VII. </T3>Small entities rarely establish defined benefit pensionplans, but instead employ other, less administratively burdensome, deferredcompensation plans. Also, no comments were received from small entities. <T3>Item XI.</T3> Most contracts awarded to small entities are awardedon a competitive fixed-price basis, and the cost principles do not apply. <T3>Item XII.</T3> The revisions merely clarify existing policy dealingwith the timing of demands for payment of debts which are owed to the Government. Therefore, the Regulatory Flexibility Act does not apply.  However, comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR sectionswill be considered in accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such commentsmust be submitted separately and cite 89-610 in correspondence pertainingto the items in FAC 84-51.  <T3>FAC 84-51, Items II, III, V, VIII, IX, X, and XIII thru XVIII.</T3>DoD, GSA, and NASA certify that the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L.96-354) does not apply to these final rules because each revision is nota ``significant revision'' as defined in FAR 1.501-1; i.e., it does notalter the substantive meaning of any coverage in the FAR having a significantcost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors, or a significanteffect beyond the internal operating procedures of the issuing agencies. <T3>FAC 84-51, Item IV. </T3>A Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis pertainingto Delivery of Excess Quantities has been prepared in accordance with theRegulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, Public Law 96-354, is on file in theFAR Secretariat, and will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy,Small Business Administration.  <ITAG tagnum="84">C.

The contractor and the higher tier subcontractor shall: (i) Conduct price analyses and, when the subcontractor is required to submitcost or pricing data, or if the contractor or higher tier subcontractoris unable to perform an adequate price analysis, cost analyses for allsubcontracts,(ii) Include the results of these analyses as part of their own cost orpricing data submission, and(iii) When required, in accordance with 15.806-2(a), submit the subcontractorcost or pricing data as part of their own cost or pricing data submission.(b) Except when the subcontract prices are based on adequate price competition,on established catalog or market prices of commercial items sold in substantialquantities to the general public, or are set by law or regulation, anycontractor required to submit certified cost or pricing data also shallobtain certified cost or pricing data before awarding any subcontract orpurchase order expected to exceed $100,000, or issuing any modificationinvolving a price adjustment expected to exceed $100,000 (see example ofpricing adjustment at 15.804-2(a)(1)(ii)). To waive subcontractor costor pricing data, follow the procedures at 15.804-3(i). (c) The requirements in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection, modifiedto relate to higher tier subcontractors rather than to the prime contractor,shall apply to lower tier subcontracts for which subcontractor cost orpricing data are required.(d) If the prime contractor negotiates subcontract prices before negotiatingthe prime contract, such subcontract prices must nevertheless be reviewedand analyzed by the Government. In no instance should such negotiated subcontractprices be accepted as the sole evidence that these prices are fair andreasonable. <ITAG tagnum="80">15.806-2</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Prospective subcontractor cost or pricing data. </ITAG>(a) The contracting officer shall require a contractor that is requiredto submit certified cost or pricing data also to submit to the Government(or cause the submission of) accurate, complete, and current cost or pricingdata from prospective subcontractors in support of each subcontract costestimate that is: (1) $1,000,000 or more,(2) Both more than $100,000 and more than 10 percent of the prime contractor'sproposed price, or(3) Considered to be necessary for adequately pricing the prime contract.These subcontract cost or pricing data may be submitted using a StandardForm 1411 (SF 1411), Contract Pricing Proposal Cover Sheet.(b) The contracting officer shall require the prospective contractor tosupport subcontractor cost estimates below the threshold in 15.806-1(b)with any data or information (including other subcontractor quotations)needed to establish a reasonable price.(c) If the prospective contractor satisfies the contracting officer thata subcontract will be priced on the basis of one of the exemptions in 15.804-3,the contracting officer normally shall not require submission of subcontractorcost or pricing data to the Government in that case. If the subcontractestimate is based upon the cost or pricing data of the prospective subcontractormost likely to be awarded the subcontract, the contracting officer shallnot require submission to the Government of data from more than one proposedsubcontractor for that subcontract.(d) Subcontractor cost or pricing data shall be accurate, complete, andcurrent as of the date of final price agreement given on the contractor'sCertificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data. The prospective contractorshall be responsible for updating a prospective subcontractor's data.(e) In exceptional cases, the contracting officer may, with the approvalof the chief of the contracting office, excuse a prospective contractorfrom submitting subcontractor cost or pricing data and the required relatedanalyses before completion of negotiations of the prime contract. The primecontractor must, however, obtain this cost or pricing data before awardof the subcontract in question. Any request from a prospective contractorto be excused from submitting subcontractor data before completion of negotiationsof the prime contract must be supported by an explanation as to why thedata and analyses cannot be submitted in a timely manner. If excusing theprospective contractor appears to be appropriate, the contracting officershall provide the chief of the contracting office with the prospectivecontractor's explanation, the contracting officer's supporting rationale,and a discussion of how the subcontract price will be determined to befair and reasonable or what steps will be taken to protect the interestof the Government, e.g., include a contract clause that provides for negotiatingan adjustment to the prime contract amount after award.<ITAG tagnum="80">15.806-3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Field pricing reports.</ITAG>(a) When obtaining field pricing support on a prime contractor proposalin accordance with 15.805-5, the contracting officer should request auditor field pricing support to analyze and evaluate the proposal of a subcontractorat any tier (notwithstanding availability of data or analyses performedby the prime contractor) if the contracting officer believes that suchsupport is necessary to ensure reasonableness of the total proposed price.This step may be appropriate when, for example_(1) There is a business relationship between the contractor and subcontractornot conducive to independence and objectivity;(2) The contractor is a sole source and the subcontract costs representa substantial part of the contract cost;(3) The contractor has been denied access to the subcontractor's records;or(4) The contracting officer determines that, because of factors such asthe size of the proposed subcontract price, audit or field pricing supportfor a subcontract or subcontracts at any tier is critical to a fully detailedanalysis of the prime contract proposal.(b) When the contracting officer requests the cognizant ACO or auditorto review a subcontractor's cost estimates, the request shall include,when available, a copy of any review prepared by the prime contractor orhigher tier subcontractor, the subcontractor's proposal, cost or pricingdata provided by the subcontractor, and the results of the prime contractor'scost or price analysis.(c) When the Government performs the subcontract analysis, the Governmentshall furnish to the prime contractor or higher tier subcontractor, withthe consent of the subcontractor reviewed, a summary of the analysis performedin determining any unacceptable costs, by element, included in the subcontractproposal.
