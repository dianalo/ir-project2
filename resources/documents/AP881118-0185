WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In the garish apartments of whatonce was the Eros-Center cabaret and bordello, indigent immigrantsfrom Eastern Europe shuffle along the hallways in kerchiefs and wornleather caps.   On Grosse Freiheit, the renowned row of rowdy nightclubs thatlaunched rock luminaries like The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix,burned-out lightbulbs and faulty neon signs serve now only toadvertise the creeping neglect that afflicts one of the world's mostfamous red-light districts.   Along this glitzy strand once called ``The Most Sinful Mile inthe World,'' the clubs and pubs and peep-shows hanging on to lifewith a dwindling clientele are furnished with tattered banquettesand wobbly tables and darkened by windows smudged with ages oftobacco smoke.   Beset by AIDS fears, unemployment and a booming X-rated videocassette market, Hamburg's famed Sankt Pauli district has fallen onthe hardest times of its colorful 150-year history.   In the early 19th century, the no-man's land between the rivalports of Hamburg and Altona welcomed the boisterous brood of sailorsand riggers scorned by fashionable city centers.   But the image of outrage worn for years with pride has decayed,leaving Sankt Pauli in much the same state of decline as otherentertainment quarters past their prime.   Today the traces of a long life of excess appear like wrinkles ona face that has not aged gracefully.   Blinking colored lights from the surviving sex shops and discosilluminate the litter and grime as clearly as the prostitutesbundled in pastel-colored ski-suits against the brisk November windsoff the Elbe.   Estimated to number about 2,000, or half the number a generationago, the women take languid draws off cigarettes or sip coffee fromfoam cups while surveying a motorized stream of carousers andcurious.   ``In the last years, because of unemployment and AIDS and ageneral reduction in the money available for this kind ofentertainment, Sankt Pauli has seen a progressive decline and isunlikely to recover from it,'' said Hans Dittrich, chief of theDavidwache police station that stands guard at Spielbudenplatz(Funhouse Square).   In some ways Sankt Pauli's loss has been Hamburg's gain, as thedeparture of many prostitutes and purveyors of pornography has madeway for more legitimate businesses and resulted in a decrease inassaults, killings and other serious crimes, Dittrich said.   ``We still have 10 or 12 purse-snatchings or unarmed assaultseach month, but the trend has been one of decline,'' the policeofficial said in an interview. ``I would characterize Sankt Paulinow as one of the safer areas of the city. Tourists have no need tofear leaving their cars here and walking around for a look at whatused to be unique.''   The region's reputation now draws more gawkers than stalkers, atrend that frustrates the economy of Sankt Pauli while maintainingits bustling appearance by night.   Sankt Pauli veterans complain that the area with its famedReeperbahn strip survives today merely as a tourist attraction.   ``Why would a guy want to sit in a cabaret and have to payhundreds of marks to drink champagne when he can rent the same thingon a video cassette and watch it at home?'' asks Edwin Ross, who for33 years has painted nude murals and signboards for Sankt Pauli'ssex theaters. ``The only people here now are first-time visitors whoremember a Reeperbahn that no longer exists.''   ``It's unfortunate we cannot stay open at night when the womenwho come here out of curiosity are looking into our windows,'' saidEva-Maria Roepke, operator of a designer lingerie and cosmeticsstore on the Reeperbahn.   West German law dictates that sales outlets must close by 6:30p.m. on weekdays and stay open for only a few hours on Saturdaymornings.   Ms. Roepke's shop has been hard-hit by the closure ofEros-Center, one of the region's two largest houses of prostitution.   ``There used to be 600 girls around the corner, but now there areonly immigrants who have no money to spend on goods like these,''she lamented, gesturing toward the skimpy and shimmeringnightclothes adorning the walls.   Eros-Center owner Wilhelm Bartels told the magazine Der Spiegelwhen he shuttered the sprawling sex shop last year that ``AIDS hasfinished off Sankt Pauli.''   While the health threat has cut deeply into the volume of sextrade in the region, the economy has followed with a devastatingfinishing blow.   West Germany suffers from an 8 percent unemployment rate, and thenature of the merchant marine has shifted over the past two decadesto a fleet comprised more often of married family men than thesingle sailors and stevedores of the past.   A nationwide liberalization 20 years ago made prostitution legalbetween 8 p.m. and 6 a.m., injecting a degree of regularity and evenlegitimacy into the ancient profession.   Precinct chief Dittrich says prostitutes have formed self-helpgroups that work with state officials to offer social securitybenefits to those willing to pay taxes on their income and toeducate young women about health risks like the AIDS virus.   The aura of acceptability has taken some of the mysticism out ofwhat the Germans used to call ``Tingeltangel,'' a Europeanforerunner of honky-tonk.   With the departure of most of the major sex theaters here havecome a number of alternatives appealing to a broader public, likethe Caribbean beat of Sam Brasil's live music club and Hamburg'sleading discotheque at Kaiserkeller, where The Beatles introducedtheir immortal sounds in the early 1960s before crossing the streetto play at the Star Club, where they rocketed to international fame.   The Broadway musical ``Cats'' has drawn crowds at theOperettenhaus since 1985, and a sprawling carnival covers thegrounds of Heiligengeistfeld (Spirits' Field) three times each year,including during the busy November-December Christmas season.   Some Sankt Pauli merchants, however, are skeptical of theregion's chances for saving itself.   ``Our best days are over,'' says Ross, the 63-year-old eroticpainter known to his neighbors as the Rubens of the Reeperbahn.   Ross' work reflects the evolution of the district and somemerchants' efforts to ride with a changing tide. Ross says most ofhis business now is in painting signs for doughnut shops and discosor making portraits from photographs to be hung in private homes.   ``There's no more business with cabarets,'' says the artist whocame here in 1955 from East Germany, where he earned his livingpainting model workers and Communist giants like Marx, Engels andLenin.   The daytime scene attests to a grim economic future, with streetsempty of all but derelicts and discarded fast-food wrappers waftingin the curls of breeze brushing the curbstones.   ``You can't make this into a Moulin Rouge, with fancy shows forwhich you have to pay 20 or 30 dancers,'' says Ross. ``For SanktPauli those days are unfortunately in the past.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Nov. 27</NOTE></DOC>
