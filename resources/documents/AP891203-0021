(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   It's got the usual fast-foodrestaurants, video-rental stores, three banks and a departmentstore. But there's something else that makes this town of 5,000more than just a spot on the map.   It's the home of Aunt Bee, the devoted, loveable matron wholooked after Sheriff Andy Taylor and his son, Opie, on ``The AndyGriffith Show.''   Born 86 years ago in New York, actress Frances Bavier chose toretire to this town after a career that included Broadway as wellas television. The town is in the same region as the fictionalMayberry, N.C.   Though she's avoided interviews and contacts with visiting fansover the years, and has been ailing lately, she's made friendsamong the folks here. And everyone calls her ``Aunt Bee.''   ``Every year at some time or another, people get it in theirhead to check up on Aunt Bee,'' says Velma Sadler, the PoliceDepartment records clerk and a 12-year friend of Ms. Bavier. ``It'sjust a shame this year's influx coincides with Aunt Bee being inthe hospital.''   Ms. Bavier was admitted to the coronary care unit of ChathamHospital here the day before Thanksgiving. Hospital officials saythey're not releasing any details at her request and that doesn'tsurprise most residents.   ``She's an extremely private individual, and she's let that beknown,'' said Wanda Ingold, town clerk.   Sometimes, admiring or curious outsiders have made lifedifficult.   ``We'll get people in here all the time asking what her addressis or for directions to her house,'' said police detective Sgt.Alphonzo Craven.   ``We get television crews and reporters down here all the timetrying to get some information,'' Craven said. ``They ask questionslike `Is there an Andy Taylor sheriff here? Is there a deputy likeBarney Fife?' It's ridiculous. All Aunt Bee wants is to be leftalone. That's why she came here _ to retire in peace.''   Before her role as Beatrice Taylor in the long-running 1960sseries starring Griffith as a Southern sheriff, Ms. Bavier appearedin such Broadway productions as ``Kiss and Tell,'' ``Point of NoReturn,'' and ``The Lady Says No.''   When she retired in the early 1970s, she moved from Los Angelesto Siler City, one of a number of towns that had invited her toappear at celebrations over the years. Like Mount Airy, the town onwhich Griffith loosely based Mayberry, it is in the hilly Piedmontregion between the coast and the Appalachians.   ``I guess when she came down here to do parades and otherevents, she just liked the people,'' Ms. Sadler said. ``It reallyis a nice area and the people are extremely nice.''   ``Sure, there might have been a fuss when she first movedhere,'' said town tax collector Dottie Mendenhall. ``Now she's justanother resident to the people who live here.''   Ms. Sadler describes Ms. Bavier as ``extremely nice to me ...nothing but a good friend. We talk about museums, operas, playswe've both seen. Why she moved here or her days on the show reallynever came up.   ``She's an elderly, ailing, sick woman.''   Siler City has a different aura from the fictional Mayberry, butit's still a family-oriented community. Women walking into theGlendale hosiery mill's outlet store are greeted by name.   ``That's just the way things are around here,'' Ms. Sadler said.``I think that's why Aunt Bee probably moved here. We have ourproblems like anyplace, but it really is a nice place to live.''</TEXT></DOC>
