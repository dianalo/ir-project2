All examinations were performed with a General Electric1.5-T unit. Sagittal images (repetition time [TR]/echo time [TE] = 600/20msec), axial multisection, multiecho images (TR/TE = 2,500/40-80), andaxial images (TR/TE = 600/20) were obtained in each patient. Multiplesites in the brainstem, cerebellum, and cerebral hemispheres were examinedin each case for the presence and degree of myelination. The resultsshow that MR imaging is sensitive to the early changes of white mattermyelination, and imaging patterns correlate with known patterns frompathologic studies. At the time of birth in a full-term infant the posteriorlimb of the internal capsule and corona radiata around the central sulcusshow visible myelination. Myelination in the centrum semiovale then proceedsanteriorly and posteriorly. Both T1- and T2-weighted images showed thesechanges, which are best explained by a decrease in the water contentof white matter as myelination progresses. Knowledge of these normalmyelination patterns is essential in evaluating MR imaging studies ininfants and children and in diagnosing delayed myelination.</TEXT></DOC>
