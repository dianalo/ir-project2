Mumia Abu-Jamal of Philadelphia is on Pennsylvania's death rowfor the fatal 1981 shooting of a white police officer. He wasconvicted in 1982 and exhausted his state court appeals last year.His latest appeal petition, filed in May, is pending before theSupreme Court.   ``The case has become the rallying cry for opponents of theracist death penalty,'' said Rachel Wolkenstein, staff attorney forthe New York-based Partisan Defense Committee, organizer ofprotests staged in London, New York, Paris, Hamburg, East Berlinand Toronto.   Studies have shown that the death penalty is disproportionatelyapplied to blacks, Hispanics, the poor and the indigent.   Among the inmates on death row, 43 percent are black, more thanthree times the percentage of blacks in the general population,acording to the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. More thantwice as many blacks who killed whites were executed since 1973 asblacks who killed other blacks, according to the NationalAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People.   A rally is planned for July 12 in Sydney, Australia, followed byothers July 14 in Philadelphia, Chicago and Oakland, Calif.   Petitions with 20,000 signatures seeking a reprieve for Jamalhave been sent to Gov. Robert Casey, along with a letter from theToronto Labour Council on behalf of 180,000 trade unionists inCanada.   ``This campaign has brought together a powerful array offorces'' who want an end to death sentences, said Gene Herson,rally chairman for the committee.   U.S. Rep. Ronald V. Dellums, D-Calif., and actor Ed Asner areamong those supporting a lesser sentence for Jamal.   ``In addition to my hatred of the death penalty ... I know thatMumia did not have a fair trial,'' liberal attorney WilliamKuntzler said during a June 28 rally in New York.   Deputy District Attorney Gaele Barthold said prosecutors wouldhave no comment because Jamal's case is in litigation.   Witnesses testified that Jamal, 36, shot Officer Daniel Faulkneronce in the back and four times at close range after the policemanstopped Jamal's brother for a traffic violation. Jamal wascritically injured when Faulkner returned fire, and later recovered.   Jamal, formerly known as Wesley Cook, was a member of the BlackPanthers and later became a supporter of the radical group MOVE anda follower of the Rastafarian movement.   He was a radio news reporter known for his focus on socialissues and served as president of the city Association of BlackJournalists. He lost the radio job in a dispute over objectivityand was working as a taxi driver before the shooting.   Ms. Wolkenstein contends Jamal had been a police target foryears.   ``He's on death row specifically because as a Black Panther andprominent journalist he spoke out against racist staterepression,'' she said.   John O'Brien, recording secretary for the Fraternal Order ofPolice, Lodge 5, said he had no knowledge of Jamal's having been apolice target, but he said the police union and its members wouldfight any attempt to overturn Jamal's death sentence.   ``As far as I'm concerned, that man deserves to die,'' he said.``He killed that man on purpose. He could have left after shootinghim once, but no, he came over and put another bullet in his head.''   Jamal, who claims he did not shoot the police officer, did nottestify at his trial.   Defense attorney Marilyn J. Gelby has argued that the prosecutorimproperly told jurors Jamal would have ``appeal after appeal afterappeal'' if convicted. The state Supreme Court said the argumentwas permissible, but the U.S. Supreme Court reversed a similarruling from Mississippi in 1985.   Such an argument ``is seen to mean that the jury is really nottaking its responsibility for the death penalty,'' Ms. Gelb said.</TEXT></DOC>
