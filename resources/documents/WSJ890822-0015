Ms. Dennis, a Democrat, has been a member of the commission since 1986. Before that, she was a member of the National Labor Relations Board. Her term at the FCC expired June 30, but she earlier expressed the hope she would be reappointed. Members may stay on the commission for a period after their terms expire, pending their reappointment or the naming of successors.    Aside from the vacancy being created by Commissioner Dennis's departure, there aren't any openings on the five-member commission. Last Friday, Alfred Sikes, former head of the Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration, was sworn in as FCC chairman. Two new commissioners, Sherrie Marshall, a Washington lawyer, and Andrew Barrett, an Illinois regulator, were confirmed earlier this month. </TEXT></DOC>
