In a report that is the latest government attack on the quality of U.S. education, the NEH said schools fail to teach students about many of the basic events and works in U.S. history and Western culture.    The NEH report, issued yesterday, was mandated by Congress in 1985 to assess humanities education in grade schools and high schools. As part of its report, the NEH also released partial results of a survey test of 8,000 U.S. 17-year-olds that showed big gaps in their historical and literary knowledge.    The NEH report blamed poor performance in the survey on changes in the social studies and English curricula that favor &quot;learning skills,&quot; or how-to courses in reading, writing and research, at the expense of basic history and literature. &quot;Instead of preserving the past,&quot; said NEH Chairman Lynne Cheney in the report, schools today &quot;more often ignore it.&quot;    The report recommended that much of the social studies curriculum should be scrapped and &quot;replaced with systematic study of history.&quot; It also said that original work should be used more to replace textbooks and readers, which the report said had been overly simplified.    In the multiple-choice test, 40% of the students couldn't place the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor between 1939 and 1943, 39% couldn't pin down the writing of the U.S. Constitution between 1750 and 1800, and 69% couldn't identify the Magna Carta as a foundation of parliamentary government. About two-thirds didn't know the authors of &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; (Geoffrey Chaucer), &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; (Walt Whitman) or &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; (Fyodor Dostoevski).    Earlier-released results have shown that students had difficulty identifying Winston Churchill, and that 68% didn't know in which half-century the U.S. Civil War took place.    About 80% of the students surveyed were enrolled in U.S. history courses at the time.    &quot;All of this amazing ignorance didn't exist among our incoming freshmen 10 years ago,&quot; said E.D. Hirsch Jr., a University of Chicago professor and author who served on an advisory committee to the report. &quot;All this emphasis on technique in our schools was wrong.&quot;    The latest NEH report follows its similar critique of humanities education in colleges and universities in 1984 by William Bennett, now Secretary of Education. Mr. Bennett has repeatedly criticized universities and elementary and secondary schools for placing too much emphasis on teaching skills.    Although worried about standards, many educators have been wary of embracing the government's findings. Specifically, they say that the Reagan administration is trying to roll back the introduction of more contemporary teaching methods and topics aimed at minorities.    &quot;I would agree that content should be reintroduced into the classroom,&quot; said S. Michael Halloran, chairman of the department of language and literature at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Rensselaer, N.Y. &quot;But culture isn't just what dead people have done or said. I don't see much call for diversity or pluralism in a lot of what's coming out of Washington these days.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
