U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said discussions with EC officials had left him &quot;mildly encouraged&quot; about the future of negotiations within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade aimed at curbing farm subsidies.    Mr. Yeutter and his EC counterpart, Agriculture Commissioner Raymond MacSharry, also indicated that the two sides have managed to shelve, at least for now, a disagreement over the controversial new hormone bovine somatotropin, or BST, which increases milk production in cows.    In addition, Mr. MacSharry said there has been progress in efforts to resolve an EC-U.S. dispute over the community's ban on hormones in beef, predicting that Washington soon may scale back further its trade sanctions against the EC. Mr. Yeutter, however, was more cautious on this issue, saying that progress would depend on whether there is an increase in U.S. shipments to the EC of hormone-free meat.    But both Messrs. Yeutter and MacSharry, who met for several hours last week in Brussels, indicated that the EC and U.S. remain far apart on several key aspects of the GATT farm talks, now heading into their final phase. Mr. MacSharry said the community will resist a U.S. plan to change all forms of agricultural protection into tariffs. EC officials said such a move would hit at the heart of the EC's Common Agricultural Policy, which cushions EC farmers against developments on world markets.    Mr. Yeutter, meanwhile, said the U.S. is &quot;vigorously opposed&quot; to the EC's call for a &quot;rebalancing&quot; of tariffs on farm products. In exchange for accepting some tariff reductions, the community wants to be allowed to impose tariffs on products that currently enter the EC duty-free. These include major U.S. exports to the EC such as soybeans and corn gluten.    Both sides are expected to put forward position papers on these issues in the next few months.    Concerning BST, the U.S. appeared to back away from earlier criticism of the EC's plan to hold off regulatory approval of the hormone until 1990. The hormone, developed by U.S. drug companies, is expected to be cleared for use in the U.S. soon. But the commission, fearing a backlash from consumers and some farmers, wants to wait for more scientific evidence before allowing use of the hormone, which can increase milk production by 25%. </TEXT></DOC>
