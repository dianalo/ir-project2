The company, which cut more than 2,000 jobs last year,said it will eliminate another 3,800 employees from its workforce of 37,000.</LP><TEXT>   To cover the employee reductions as well as otherrestructuring and divestment costs and write-offs, ScottPaper said it will have a fourth-quarter charge totaling $183million, or $2.49 a share, about half related to employeereduction costs.   The charge will result in a net loss for the quarter andthe year; special items aside, Scott Paper estimated its netat 35 cents a share for the fourth quarter and $1.54 for theyear. The company expects to release its fourth-quarterearnings Jan. 30.   Philip E. Lippincott, chairman and chief executiveofficer, said the restructuring is &quot;essential&quot; to improvingresults over the short term. &quot;We must continue to beaggressive in reducing costs in order to substantiallystrengthen our competitive position and enhance shareholdervalue in the future,&quot; he said.   The company had begun its cost-cutting plan earlier thisyear but said difficult market conditions more than offsetany progress that had been made, forcing it to broaden andaccelerate the program. The firings are part of Scott Paper'sefforts to eliminate low-priority work and focus on its corebusiness-personal care, cleaning products and quality coatedprinting and publishing papers.   A spokesman said the work force reductions will occur atall levels of the organization in a number of differentbusinesses. Half of the cuts will take place in the U.S.   The announcement highlights the paper industry'scontinuing struggle in one of the longest downturns indecades. Last November, Scott Paper indicated plans to cutmore jobs and shed more business than it had previouslyindicated and reorganized its management to focus on its corebusinesses.   The company also announced a number of accountingrevisions for depreciating its machinery and equipment andthe cost of retiree benefit programs under the requirementsof Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement 106. ScottPaper said a new estimation of the depreciable lives of itspaper machines and related equipment will reduce its annualdepreciation expense by 75 cents a share beginning in 1992.   The adoption of FASB Statement 106 will increase annualexpenses by about 30 cents a share. The accounting standard,which all U.S. companies are required to adopt starting in1993, requires them to set up a reserve for health benefitsfor current employees when they reach retirement. In doingthis, companies have to take noncash charges to reflect theaccrued benefits of prior years that hadn't been reflected inprevious financial statements. The company said it plans tobegin adoption of the accounting revision by the firstquarter of 1992.   In 1990 the company had net income of $148 million, or$2.01 a share, on revenue of $5.36 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
