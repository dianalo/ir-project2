LOUIS -- Inside its massive palace of research here,Monsanto Co. is placing a billion-dollar bet onbiotechnology. From these laboratories eventually may comesuch breakthrough products as tomato plants that engendertheir own insecticides, potato plants &quot;vaccinated&quot; againstviruses and a hormone that makes pigs yield leaner pork.   But Monsanto is getting a rocky reception for the firstproduct to come out of these labs. Last month, Wisconsin'sGov. Tommy Thompson signed into law a one-year ban oncommercial use of BGH, a bovine growth hormone that boostscows' milk production, after an outcry from the very marketthe company had hoped to tap -- dairy farmers. Some smallfarmers feared the hormone would cause an oversupply of milk,forcing prices down.</LP><TEXT>   As the brouhaha indicates, product introduction can be astortuous and time-consuming as product research -- a fact ofspecial note at Monsanto. The diversified chemicals companyspent most of the last decade stuffing its new-productpipeline. &quot;There has never been a time since I've been withthe company, when we've had this array of things coming,&quot;says Richard Mahoney, a 27-year Monsanto veteran and itschief executive.   The reckoning will come in the 1990s. Largely apetrochemicals concern until a decade ago, the company isincreasingly vying in the drug and food markets, in which aproduct can be destroyed by a promotional misstep or bypolitical or regulatory difficulties. Genetic engineeringventures, in particular, typically spark passionate debates.   Many believe Monsanto will manage to pull it off. WallStreet analysts believe some of its new products could beblockbusters. They forecast annual sales of $100 million to$200 million for BGH, $300 million to $500 million for a newfat substitute to be sold by Monsanto's NutraSweet Co., and$500 million for an ulcer drug marketed by the G.D. Searle andamp;Co. unit. Monsanto won't comment on the projections.   But there have been some setbacks. Monsanto had expectedto be selling BGH in the U.S. by now, but sales so far arelimited to Czechoslovakia. NutraSweet is scrambling to get ajump on some giant competitors that are about to follow itinto fake fats. And Searle, once praised by the Food and DrugAdministration for developing a life-saving ulcer drug,recently had a spat with the agency over its advertising ofthat drug, Cytotec.   A sense of urgency pervades the company, whose mainstayproducts face growing competition. Patents are running out onits glyphosate herbicide, known as Roundup; on its aspartamelow-calorie sweetener, NutraSweet; and on ananti-hypertension drug, Calan SR. Together, these compoundsaccount for about 20% of sales and about 40% of profit.   Last year, Monsanto's profit rose 15% to $679 million.Sales increased 4.7% to $8.68 billion. But first-quarterprofit was down 13%, a dip Monsanto attributed to a weakermarket for its plastics and to farmers' delayed purchases ofherbicides. The stock has been volatile in recent weeks. InBig Board trading, it closed yesterday at $102.50, up $1.25.   A closer look at three of Monsanto's most important newproducts -- BGH, Simplesse fat substitute and Cytotec --provides some insights about the often rough road to market.                                                                                                          Bovine Growth Hormone                                                                                                          Monsanto is counting on BGH to be the first to generatesome return on the more than $1 billion it has invested inbiotechnology. A protein like one cows produce naturally, BGHis made by genetically engineered bacteria and then injectedtwice a month. In farm trials, milk yields have shot up by10% to 25%.   But Wisconsin's move to ban BGH temporarily may emboldenfarmers in other states who also fear a milk glut.Wisconsin's suspension, in effect until June 1, 1991, hastriggered a one-year ban in Minnesota. Anti-BGH groups arevowing to step up campaigns elsewhere. But a proposed banfailed this week to get through the Vermont Legislature.   How long the moves might delay sale of the hormone remainsunclear, since FDA marketing approval isn't expected untilnext year anyway. FDA officials say milk from BGH-treatedcows is safe. But the bans could lead to other problems forMonsanto.   James Tobin, a BGH marketing manager for Monsanto,acknowledges that opponents may press for other measures,such as laws that would require milk from treated cows to belabeled. That, Monsanto fears, could alarm consumers, who areincreasingly concerned about food safety.   Mr. Tobin asserts that the bans could lead other farmerseager to boost milk production to demand BGH. Clearly, thereare dairy farmers looking to use the hormone, althoughsurveys by the company and BGH opponents vary sharply.Monsanto maintains that BGH won't bring about a sudden milkglut, because it will gain use gradually. Because BGH offersa quick return on investment, the company says, it won'tfavor big farmers over small.   But many small farmers, having endured wrenching changesin the farm economy, remain leery. &quot;This will devastate ruralcommunities and small farmers,&quot; asserts John Kinsman, afarmer who has helped to spark the protest in Wisconsin.   John Musick, who directs an anti-BGH group in Minnesota,says he is hopeful opponents of the hormone will succeed --if not in keeping it off the market, then in turningconsumers against it. A BGH scare &quot;could be just like theAlar situation,&quot; he says, referring to the scare last yearover a chemical used on apples. &quot;Suddenly organically grownapples were in demand.&quot;   The FDA has approved the sale of milk from BGH trials.However, some big grocery-store chains, including Kroger Co.,have refused to sell the milk. The chains say they are tryingto size up consumer attitudes on the matter.   Another genetically engineered new product is alsogenerating some controversy. Monsanto is conducting fieldtrials of cotton and soybean plants designed to resist itsRoundup herbicide, which generated sales of about $1 billionlast year. Such plants might greatly expand the market forthe herbicide; it now kills crops and weeds alike, so farmershave to use it before crops break through the soil.   But some environmental groups say herbicide-resistantplants would keep farmers heavily dependent on chemicals.They are seeking to have tax credits for this type ofresearch eliminated. Monsanto contends the continued use ofRoundup -- generally acknowledged to be one of the saferherbicides -- and the introduction of Roundup-resistant cropswould mean less use of more-harmful herbicides.   Selling Roundup-resistant crops would assure Monsanto of astrong market for the herbicide, which has lost patentprotection in a few countries so far. It will lose suchprotection in many many more starting in 1991.                                                                                                          Simplesse                                                                                                          Monsanto's NutraSweet Co. scored a coup in marketing itsaspartame sweetener. Among other things, it sold it to foodproducers with the proviso that the ingredient's logo appearon the final product, thus winning consumer loyalty for amere ingredient. The question now is whether the company canpull off the same trick with its fat substitute, Simplesse.   Monsanto's strategy: Introduce Simplesse, a blend of milkand egg-white protein, in a food item that millions crave,albeit guiltily because it is fattening: ice cream. Hence thefat-free Simple Pleasures. In February, the FDA gaveNutraSweet approval to sell the frozen dessert, which thecompany expects to get into grocers' freezers by summer.   In the case of Simplesse, however, NutraSweet is takingthe unusual tactic of manufacturing the dessert itself,rather than selling the fat substitute to food concerns.NutraSweet's reasoning is that it wants to maintain controlover crucial decisions, such as flavors. Simple Pleasureswill come in six, including chocolate and rum raisin.   Simplesse will face tough competition in the dairy case.Even Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream Inc., a main distributor ofSimple Pleasures, has recently brought out a fat-freedessert; Dreyer's ice cream is aimed at a lower-pricedmarket, however.   Some marketing titans may soon be weighing into this foodfight with their own new products. Kraft General Foods Inc.,a division of Philip Morris Cos., is seeking FDA approval fora fake fat similar to Simplesse. Procter andamp; Gamble Co. wantsapproval of one that is more versatile; its fake fat can beused in hot and cold foods.   An already heated contest for shelf space is likely tosharpen. The ice cream buyer for Jewel Food Stores, aChicago-area chain, says of Simple Pleasures, &quot;We're kind ofdragging our feet on it, because shelf space is so tight.&quot;   NutraSweet is seeking FDA approvals to use Simplesse inother foods, including mayonnaise, salad dressings, sourcream, dips, margarine, butter, cheese. The company hasn'truled out making some of these foods itself.   NutraSweet has had extraordinary success with aspartame,now used in some 3,000 food and beverage items. Last year,including the tabletop sweetener Equal, sales reached $869million.   Robert Shapiro, the company's chief executive, insists thesweetener still has a bright future. Yet in countries whereaspartame has lost patent protection, the company haspreserved market share only through drastic price reductions.In December 1991, patent protection ends in the the biggestmarket, the U.S.                                                                                                          Cytotec                                                                                                          Searle won high praise in regulatory circles last yearwhen it introduced its ulcer drug, Cytotec, in the U.S.Recently, though, Searle ran afoul of the FDA -- over itsadvertising.   The FDA recently forced the drug maker to take out anembarrassing ad in medical journals. It read, in part,&quot;Published To Correct a Previous Advertisement Which The FoodAnd Drug Administration Considered Misleading.&quot;   The FDA said a previous Cytotec ad falsely suggested thatthe drug could be used to treat a broader, typically younger,group of patients than the agency had recommended. One of theFDA's concerns: The earlier ad featured a photo of a womanSearle said was 62. But the FDA thought the model looked tooyouthful. Searle said it didn't intend to mislead.   The flap suggests the difficulties of aggressivelymarketing the drug. Purchased by Monsanto in 1985 for $2.75billion, Searle has revived its research and development,which had withered. The company intends to introduce over thenext decade a steady stream of new drugs, of which Cytotec isthe first. U.S. sales started strong, then hit a plateau. Inrecent weeks, Searle says, sales have begun to climb again.   Searle is seeking to carve out a unique role for Cytotecamid such big-selling ulcer drugs as Glaxo Holdings PLC'sZantac and SmithKline Beecham PLC's Tagamet. Cytotec is aimedespecially at arthritis patients who are on nonsteroidalanti-inflammatory drugs. Such patients often develop stomachulcers. Cytotec, a synthetic prostaglandin, is believed tohelp protect the stomach lining.   Cytotec sometimes has side effects, like abdominal crampsand diarrhea, so doctors tend to be cautious in prescribingit. Doctors sometimes advise patients to take only half atablet.   Searle is trying to fine-tune Cytotec. It is seeking todevelop a sustained-release formulation that lessens sideeffects. The company is performing other studies to determinewhether the drug could be used to treat other conditions.Searle forecasts world-wide Cytotec sales this year between$80 million and $90 million, up from $60 million last year.   Meanwhile, the makers of Zantac and Tagamet are eyeing theCytotec market. Both are undertaking studies in an effort towin regulatory approval for use in treating the samecondition.   ---        Monsanto: Trying to Deliver on Commitments                                                                                                                      Now a Diversified Company                                                                                                              Chemicals ......................  47%       Crop chemicals .................  18%       Pharmaceuticals (Searle Division) 13%       NutraSweet .....................  10%       Fisher controls ................  10%       Animal sciences ................   2%                                                                                                                    Producing for shareholders                                                                                                            1989 return on shareholders' equity, in percent                                                                                                               Union Carbide ..........   24%        Chemical industry avg. .   17.9%        Monsanto ...............   17.6%        Du Pont ................   15.9%        B.F.
