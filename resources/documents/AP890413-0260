WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Chancellor Helmut Kohl today fired hisdefense minister and replaced seven other Cabinet members in anapparent bid to stop his party's declining popularity.   In addition to the defense post, Kohl announced a new chief ofstaff and new ministers for finance, interior, transport, economiccooperation, construction and information.   He told a news conference the changes were not a directconsequence of his Christian Democratic Union's recent electionsetbacks, but he conceded his party and coalition government face``a totally new situation.''   The Christian Democratic Union under Kohl has suffered severelosses in recent local elections. Last month, the party and itsjunior coalition partner, the Free Democratic Party, lost controlof the Frankfurt city government.   ``I had planned this Cabinet rebuilding long before that,'' Kohlsaid when asked about the Frankfurt election's influence on his newappointments.   Defense Minister Rupert Scholz was the only Cabinet member leftjobless under the changes. He was replaced by Finance MinisterGerhard Stoltenberg.   Scholz had no military experience prior to his appointment inMay and often was left to publicly defend the government's mostcontroversial defense policies. He absorbed the brunt of publiccriticism for last year's deadly string of NATO and West Germanmilitary jet crashes.   Political observers considered most of the other changescosmetic.   The most significant was the naming of Theo Waigel, head of theChristian Democratic's Bavarian sister party _ the ChristianSocialist Union _ to replace Stoltenberg as finance minister.   The change brings Waigel into the top government sphere, apolitical gift to the Christian Socialists. Some observerssuggested the appointment was demanded of Kohl to ensure theparty's allegiance to the Christian Democrats.   Finance officials said Waigel won the position on a promise torepeal or reform a 10 percent withholding tax that took effect thisyear and drove some investments out of the country.   Stoltenberg had been finance minister since 1982, when theChristian Democratic Union joined forces with the liberal FreeDemocratic Party to take over the Bonn government from theleft-leaning Social Democrats.   Kohl praised the work of Scholz, who he said was ``confrontedwith many problems for which he cannot be made responsible.''   He dismissed questions on whether the Defense Ministry changewould alter the federal government's attitude toward somecontroversial defense policies, including whether Bonn will supporta NATO plan to replace some short-range missiles deployed in WestGermany.   West German defense policy is increasingly the target of publiccriticism and discontent because of the number of NATO maneuversand low-level flying missions allowed to take place over denselypopulated areas.   ``We are in intensive discussions with our coalition partnersand the alliance,'' the chancellor said. He refused to elaborate.   The government appointments take effect April 21, Kohl said.   Other top-level changes included the naming of Kohl's chief ofstaff, Wolfgang Schaeuble, as interior minister to replaceFriedrich Zimmermann, who will take over the Transport Ministry.   Kohl's new chief of staff will be Rudolf Seiters, current headof the party's parliamentary delegation.   Transport Minister Juergen Warnke replaces Hans Klein asminister for economic cooperation. Klein will be the new governmentspokesman, which has been elevated to ministerial level.   The current head of the government Press and Information Officeand Kohl's chief spokesman, Friedhelm Ost, resigned and is reportedto be considering offers in the private sector.   Construction Minister Oscar Schneider was assigned to overseethe government's controversial national museum projects in Bonn andBerlin. He will be replaced by parliamentarian Gerda Hasselfeldt,who brings the number of women in Kohl's 19-member Cabinet to three.</TEXT></DOC>
