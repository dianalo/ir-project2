<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-32-0520 </DOCNO><TEXT>We present a quark confinement model (QCM) for the description of thelow-energy physics of light hadrons (mesons and baryons). The model isbased on two hypotheses. First, the quark confinement is realized asaveraging over vacuum gluon fields which are believed to provide theconfinement of any colour objects. Second, hadrons are treated as collectivecolourless excitations of quark-gluon interactions. The description ofstrong, electromagnetic and weak interactions of mesons and baryons atthe low energy is given from a unique point of view. 18 refs.; 7 figs.;2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
