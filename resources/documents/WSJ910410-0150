Bank of New York, the nation's 15th-largest bank, was thefirst big U.S. bank to report first-quarter results. Butanalysts said the loss didn't necessarily indicate that otherbig banks will also report losses. They noted that Bank ofNew York, unlike many other major banks, didn't set aside anunusually large provision for loans losses last year.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This does not presage significant loan loss reserveadditions at many major banks in the first quarter,&quot; saidAllerton G. Smith, a bank analyst at First Boston Corp. &quot;Manyother companies put loan loss provisions into the reserve in1990,&quot; he said. He added, however, that he believes thatmajor banks will report that nonperforming loans increased byan average of 10% to 20% in the first quarter.   Bank of New York's first-quarter loss was $63 million, or$1.02 a share, compared with year-earlier net income of $102million, or $1.37 a share. The loss reflected a $343 millionprovision for loan losses, compared with a $64 millionprovision in last year's first quarter. Significantly, thehigher provision wasn't caused by an increase in troubledcommercial real estate loans, which hurt many other bankslast year.   Bank of New York cut its quarterly dividend to 38 cents ashare from 53 cents. The dividend is payable May 3 to holdersof record as of April 19.   Reacting to the dividend cut and loss, Bank of New Yorkshares fell $2.125 each to close at $27.125 a share in NewYork Stock Exchange composite trading.   Wall Street analysts had been expecting Bank of New Yorkto report a profit for the quarter. &quot;The Street was clearlyleaning toward a positive number, close to 90 cents a share,&quot;said James McDermott, president of bank-stock specialistKeefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods Inc. The average prediction of 12securities firms surveyed by First Call, a research service,was for net of 81 cents a share.   James M. Rosenberg, a bank analyst at Lehman Brothers Inc.who has been recommending Bank of New York's stock sinceJanuary, said he was surprised by the loss, but didn't changehis recommendation. &quot;What they're trying to do, to someextent, is clear the decks for better performance later inthe year,&quot; he said.   Bank of New York also said it has signed a letter ofintent to sell BNY Financial Corp., a unit involved infactoring, which is the purchase of trade receivables fromcommercial and industrial companies. The bank didn't disclosethe buyer or the sale price, but said it expects &quot;asignificant&quot; gain from the sale, which is expected to closein the second quarter.   Even without that gain, Bank of New York said it expectsto report a profit for the second quarter and the year.   Nonperforming assets increased in the quarter by $254million, or 16%, to $1.85 billion. During the quarter, $141million of loans to highly leveraged transactions, which aremostly leveraged buy-outs, were put on nonperforming status.An additional $155 million of other commercial loans werealso put on nonperforming status.   Nonperforming assets were 6.2% of assets at March 31, upfrom 4.8% at Dec. 31.   Bank of New York said that 12 loans totaling $179 millionwere placed on nonperforming status even though the borrowershaven't missed any interest payments. The bank said the loansmay go into default in the future.   Mr. Smith of First Boston said that it appears that Bankof New York's nonperforming highly leveraged transactionloans increased to about 10% of the bank's portfolio of suchloans, which he said is &quot;slightly above average&quot; for majorbanks. Bank of New York said it will release more details ofits results later this week.</TEXT></DOC>
