Meanwhile, former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone agreed totestify in Parliament about his links to the scandal, Kyodo NewsService reported. Opposition parties have stalled parliamentarybusiness to back demands that he testify.   Katsuya Ikeda, 51, a four-term member of the House ofRepresentatives, cited personal reasons today for his resignationfrom Parliament and from the Clean Government Party, thesecond-largest opposition party after the Socialists.   In November, a member of the Japan Socialist Party, Takumi Ueda,gave up his seat in Parliament after news reports linked him withthe scandal.   Ikeda, a former journalist, acknowledged in November that hisbrother, Yuzuru, bought 5,000 unlisted stock shares from RecruitCo. at a bargain price in 1986. After public trading began and thestock price soared, the brother made a profit of about $73,530.   The company, accused of trying to influence government policy,sold such shares in a Recruit subsidiary to some 160 influentialpoliticians, bureaucrats and businessmen.   It also made large political contributions to politiciansincluding Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, who announced last monthhe would resign to take responsibility for the scandal.   The governing Liberal Democratic Party still is searching for acandidate untainted by the scandal but commanding widespreadsupport in the party to succeed Takeshita. It hopes a new leaderwith a clean reputation will reverse the party's loss in popularitybefore elections this summer for half the seats in Parliament'supper house.   Ikeda has denied personal involvement in his brother's stocktransactions, but news reports said $51,470 of the profit wasdeposited into Ikeda's bank account, and that Ikeda also received$102,940 in donations from Recruit.   The reports said Ikeda used his influence as a member of thegovernment's Education Affairs Committee in 1986 for the benefit ofRecruit, which specializes in publishing employment information forstudents.   At a news conference, Ikeda denied receiving the donation, andthat the stock deal was in return for favors for Recruit.   Prosecutors have arrested 14 public officials and Recruitexecutives so far on charges of bribery and securities lawviolations in the stock deals. In addition, three members ofTakeshita's Cabinet have resigned because of links with Recruit.   Nakasone, who was prime minister at the time of the stock dealsand whose aides were among Recruit stock purchasers, previously hadsaid he would testify in Parliament only after prosecutorscompleted their investigations of the Recruit case.   This time, in a meeting with Ryutaro Hashimoto, the rulingparty's deputy secretary general, Nakasone did not set anyconditions, Kyodo said.   Opposition parties want to question Nakasone about the resale ofU.S.-made supercomputers to Recruit from Japan's telecommunicationsgiant, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. NTT's former chairman,Hasashi Shinto, has been arrested on charges that he took bribesfrom Recruit in the form of bargain stock shares.</TEXT></DOC>
