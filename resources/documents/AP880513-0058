While the practical applications are remote, the breakthroughrepresents a major step in providing scientists with new forms ofgenetic engineering. In addition, they expect to identify someinherited disorders caused by mistakes in the second code.   Schimmel reported taking the first step toward deciphering thecode, which governs the the final assembly of proteins in cells.His findings were described Thursday in Nature, a Britishscientific journal.   Alexander Rich, an MIT biologist unconnected with the research,said, ``The important thing in Schimmel's discovery is that theresults are strikingly simple.'' Most researchers would haveguessed that a more complex code was needed, he said.   The original genetic code was deciphered in 1961. Researchersfound that the sequence of distinct chemical subunits in thegenetic material DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) determined whichprotein would be made by that gene.   Change the DNA sequence, and you'd change the protein _ bychanging its sequence of chemical subunits.   DNA doesn't make proteins directly, however. It hands off itsinstructions to a chemical called messenger RNA, which in turnpasses the information to a third chemical called transfer RNA.   The transfer RNA then uses the second genetic code to actuallyassemble proteins from their amino acid building blocks.   The discovery of the original genetic code led to the field ofgenetic engineering, in which scientists alter the genetic materialof cells in order to create proteins, such as those used asmedicines.   Researchers had searched for the key to the second code sincethe first one was deciphered, and many abandoned their effortsafter repeated failures.   Schimmel and his MIT colleague, Ya-Ming Hou, broke the code forthe amino acid called alanine. (Each molecule of transfer RNA iscoded for one of the 20 amino acids.)   The DNA and RNA molecules are made up of subunits called basepairs. The MIT researchers found, to their surprise, that the codefor alanine was carried in a single base pair on the alaninetransfer RNA molecule.   It should now be a straightforward process to decipher thetransfer RNA codes for the remaining 19 amino acids, Schimmel said.   Minor errors in this second genetic code might give rise todisease, Schimmel said. Deciphering the code could help doctorsunderstand and possibly treat such diseases, he said.   ``Any errors in this system, if they occur to a significantextent, are lethal,'' Schimmel said. ``The proteins would all bescrambled.''   The importance of the finding lies primarily in its elucidationof a long-standing biological mystery, however, not in anyshort-term practical applications, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
