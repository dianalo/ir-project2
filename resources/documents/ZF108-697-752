 In a section of thebook called &quot;Evaluations -- Quick and Expensive Comments of the Talent in theRoom,&quot; he trashed most of his contemporary writers.andP;  Myrick Land documentedthe ensuing feuds in his less celebrated but funnier book, The Fine Art ofLiterary Mayhem.andP;  The Mailer chapter -- Mailer must have been miffed to findthat the entire book was not devoted to him -- was titled, &quot;Mr.andP;  NormanMailer Challenges All the Talent in the Room.&quot;andM;Microsoft spent megabucks rolling out Windows 3.0 this May and will bespending more over the next months to encourage Windows 2 users to upgradeand nonusers to take the plunge.andP;  Is this upgrade such a big deal?andM;It's such a big deal.andP;  Bill Gates claims that Windows 3.0 will have an impacton every aspect of the personal computer industry.andP;  He's probably right.andP;  Thefollowing are some thoughts on Windows 3.0 vs.andP;  the talent in the room, withthe glaring exception of the heavyweight contender out in the hall.andP;  AsStephen Morse pointed out in PC Week, Presentation Manager is quite capableof delaying itself with no help from Windows 3.0andM;Win 3 vs.andP;  DOSandM;Industry watcher Stewart Alsop's view is that the release of Windows 3.0 willincrease Apple market share along with the Windows market share, both at thecost of DOS.andP;  PC Week quotes Bill Gates as predicting that Windows willoutsell DOS in a year.andM;Windows as a threat to DOS is, in a sense, nonsense.andP;  Nobody is going to buyWindows rather than DOS.andP;  Windows is a DOS extension, more closely integratedwith DOS than any shell, requiring and using DOS, in particular the DOS filesystem.andP;  Furthermore, Windows 3 supports non-Windows applications, meaningplain DOS applications.andP;  Finally, any way you slice the Windows/DOS pie,Microsoft gets fed.andM;The threat that Windows poses is to DOS as a development platform.andP;  It raisesthe question, is there any reason to develop for plain DOS anymore?andP;  Theanswer is surely yes.andP;  Here's a sample of some classes of users who willstill need or want raw DOS.andM;1.andP;  The users of dedicated one-application PC-class machines that do theirrespective jobs well.andP;  If such a user sees no need to upgrade an 8086-classmachine running DOS and such an application, then the user will probably notmake the significant investment required.andP;  Some such applications, despiteWindows 3's support for non-Windows applications, will need an upgrade, andsome perfectly functional applications that happen to be no longer supportedwon't be getting any upgrade.andM;It's interesting to speculate on how many of these machines will go oncranking away in such environments.andP;  And that's all we can do: speculate.andO;Industry history is not long enough to base predictions on, and pre-personalcomputer software and hardware experience is an entirely different world oftechnology and pricing.andP;  But the matter is unimportant in terms of developingcommercial software.andP;  Such machines and people effectively become invisibleto the market.andP;  One application, already sold, is not a market; people whohave no need to spend money are not potential customers.andP;  The veil falls onthese people.andM;2.andP;  The impecunious.andP;  Also behind the veil.andP;  To make use of Windows 3.0, inparticular to be able to use multitasking, the minimum configuration is a 286with 2 Mbyte of memory and EGA.andP;  Any PC owner who doesn't have this hardwarehas the choice of buying it or doing without Windows.andP;  Some will do without,and like homeless people in the census, will drop out of the demographics.andM;3.andP;  Users of embedded systems.andP;  Last fall, Microsoft released ROM ExecutableMS-DOS v.3.22, a true DOS in ROM.andP;  Datalight and Digital Research both alsosell ROMable DOS clones.andP;  These users probably don't need windows and icons.andM;4.andP;  Engineers and scientists.andP;  There should be no compelling reason foranyone in this market to buy or hang on to a raw DOS machine as a CPU; ifthere is in a year or two, it will mean that Windows developers have not beenseeing all the market opportunities.andP;  But a raw-DOS machine as a device isanother thing altogether.andP;  One can easily imagine an array of DOS machinescontrolling instruments, with a Windows box standing between all of them andthe researcher user.andM;But for new purchases of personal computers for business and other commercialuses, raw DOS is dead.andP;  With upgrades running $50 even for runtime users,Windows 3 is priced well, and Microsoft is pushing it hard.andM;Win 3 vs.andP;  other DOS ExtendersandM;The actual competitors to Windows on Intel CPU-based hardware are the otherDOS extenders or Windowing systems.andP;  Anyone interested in the technicaldetails of how DOS extenders can live with Windows 3.0 should read RayDuncan's Extending DOS(Addison-Wesley, 1990).andP;  Theoretically, the DOSProtected-Mode Interface (DPMI) lets a DOS extender attain full compatibilitywith Windows 3.0.andP;  But now that there is a canonical windowing extension toDOS produced and marketed by the DOS folks, it won't be fun to compete inthat market.andP;  And Windows 3 is much better than Windows of the past.andM;Win 3 vs.andP;  Win 2andM;Windows 3 is a big improvement over Windows 2.andP;  What strikes one immediatelyis that the Romper Room primary colors have been replaced by a suite ofsophisticated color schemes.andP;  This is of no technical significance whatever,but it is indicative of the hand of designers in the user interface, andthat's very important to the product's success.andP;  At the low end, where a bigbattle will begin this fall, this sort of thing matters a lot.andM;Microsoft's Windows 3 GUI team included human factors psychologists, andvisual designers were involved in the development of the GUI.andP;  The result isa product that should be significantly more attractive to users than Windows2.andP;  The user is given full control over color, but it's easier to select apredefined suite of colors that look good together than to tweak individualcolors.andP;  This is a good example of providing the customizability but guidingthe user toward reasonable customizations.andM;The Windows interface now uses proportional fonts.andP;  Not only does this makethe display more readable, but it also raises the professional look of theproduct.andP;  Examining installed fonts and installing new ones is simple andintuitive.andP;  The next release is expected to use TrueType outline fonts.andM;Setup and configuration for particular hardware is largely automatic.andP;  Thisis also very important if Microsoft expects Windows to bring new people intocomputing.andP;  Apple, which has an easier job of it, has set up plug-and-playexpectations that Windows has to come close to meeting, and does.andP;  Also,user-friendly Control Panel options let the user select printer and networkoptions from lists; these selections become effective immediately, withoutreinstalling or restarting Windows.andM;There are some holes in the GUI that let DOS show through.andP;  The SysEditprogram, which brings up all configuration files for editing, is very handy,but looking through a Maclike window at DOS batch commands will be adisorienting thing for a new computer user.andM;All these user interface issues are important to the user acceptance and thesuccess of the platform.andP;  More important from a technical perspective are thequestions of what capabilities the product supports, and how easy it is todevelop for it.andM;The big accomplishment is probably memory management.andP;  Running in protectedmode on the 286 and 386, supporting virtual 8086 machines on the 386, arethings that matter.andP;  3.0 is also more cognizant of networks than 2.x, but itdoesn't demand a lot of network awareness from the user.andP;  New APIs letnetwork applications mask the difference between local and remote resources.andO;Transparency of remote access is going to become important.andM;It will take time for the benefits of interapplication communication toemerge, but the dynamic data exchange messaging protocol (DDE) provides thebasis for applications that cooperate in ways not seen before.andM;The reassuring news is the ease of transition from Version 2 to Version 3,which, Windows developers are saying, is a piece of cake.andP;  The essentialtool, of course, is the Windows SDK, and device driver developers will needthe DDK.andP;  New Windows developers should probably start, according todevelopers at a recent meeting of the Software Entrepreneurs Forum, withCharles Petzold's Programming Windows.andM;While the GUI is not as unified and intuitive as the Mac's, it's close enoughto make a Windows box look like a direct competitor to a Mac.andP;  Andtechnically, Windows has capabilities that go well beyond what the Mac doesat present.andM;Of course, Apple has something up its sleeve.andM;System 7 vs.andP;  System 6andM;At the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in May, developers got fivedays' intense exposure to System 7, the biggest thing in Apple systemsoftware since the original Mac operating system.andP;  It's expected to be out bythe end of the year.andM;System 7 includes a new Finder and other reworkings of the user interface.andO;The improvements are impressive, delivering more power and customizability tothe user while at the same time making the interface more consistent, withfewer things to learn.andP;  There's something more than consistency involved; ithas to do with getting across to the user a big idea, a general metaphor, andletting the user figure out how things ought to work.andP;  Apple does a betterjob of this than anybody in the industry, and Finder 7 is better at it thanthe current Finder.andM;Now, pretty much anything the user can click on does something reasonable:Applications, utilities, desk accessories, and control panels all launch whenclicked; documents open; and other things return useful information aboutthemselves.andP;  Some formerly opaque objects now open to reveal theircomponents.andP;  This natural extension of the click-to-open idea eliminates theneed for one utility and one user interface: The font/DA mover is no longerneeded because fonts and DAs (desk accessories) are stored in openablecontainers.andM;Not all the changes reduce the set of concepts the user has to acquire.andO;Apple agonized over one element that it has finally added to the interface:The movable modal dialog box.andP;  The user interface had not previouslydistinguished modality from immovability, and separating these aspectsvisually caused a lot of headaches.andP;  The final design, drawing both itsvisual appearance and performance from existing elements, will probably passcompletely unnoticed by most users, which will be evidence that Apple did itright.andM;There's a Find menu option for finding files; it seems to be fast, and allowsa lot of ways to direct the search.andP;  There are a number of smaller tweaks tothe GUI.andP;  Band selection and window and trash behavior have been honed.andP;  Thenew trash can is another example of the tighter integration of the interface:The trash can was formerly a unique object, but now it's a folder, with nopeculiar behavior to learn and adapt to.andP;  There are new sizes and colors oficons.andP;  The outline views in folders and the new keyboard equivalents formouse moves look like similar features in Windows.andM;There's also a system-wide help system called &quot;Balloon Help.&quot;andP;  Turn it on viaan ever present menu item, and anything you point at gives some helpfulaccount of itself in a pop-up cartoon-style word balloon.andP;  Apple has alreadydocumented the system itself with Balloon Help.andP;  Developers can add BalloonHelp to their applications without changing any code; the help messages arejust resources with pointers to the resources (menu items, controls, windowparts, and so on) that they document.andP;  Balloon Help is one aspect of theToolbox Help Manager, which provides facilities for more customized helpsystems.andP;  Balloon Help is intended to provide a basic level of help, lettingthe user ask, &quot;What is this?&quot; or &quot;What does this do?&quot;andP;  It's not intended tobe the basis of a complete on-line documentation system, but Help Manager isintended to provide the tools for building such a system.andM;System 7 includes virtual memory, which the user can turn on or off.andO;MultiFinder is always on, so the System 7 Mac is never a one-applicationmachine.andP;  Finder, the system-support application, is always on, reachable viaan everpresent menu at the right end of the menubar, its capabilitiesavailable to other applications via Apple's interapplication communication.andM;The interapplication communication (IAC) and networking features are nice.andO;IAC includes several components, particularly AppleEvents, Edition Manager,and the PPC Toolbox.andM;AppleEvents and changes to the current Event Manager implement the frameworkfor a standard language of messages that applications can pass to each otheror to the Finder.andP;  The set of standard events is largely undefined; Apple issoliciting developer input.andP;  A few events have been defined, including Oapp(open application), ODoc (open document), PDoc (print document), and Quit.andO;All future applications are expected to support these, and others that arebeing defined.andP;  A set of events called &quot;Finder Events&quot; has been defined andimplemented in the Finder; applications can avail themselves of thecapabilities of the Finder by generating Finder Events.andM;The Edition Manager implements the publish and subscribe capability.andP;  This islive copy and paste: When the &quot;published&quot; document or document section isupdated, all subscribing documents are also updated.andP;  Apple wants allapplications to support publish and subscribe, making the facility asubiquitous as copy and paste.andP;  There currently are some user interface issuesto be resolved; even Apple's own HyperCard team appears to be holding off onsupport for Edition Manager until these issues are resolved.andM;The PPC Toolbox is the low-level facility for implementing process-to-processcommunication.andP;  Since there is no standard set of events at this level, itwill require close cooperation between application developers to use thislevel.andP;  Because it's low level, it will provide higher performance thanAppleEvents.andP;  It will probably be used by large software vendors to puthigh-performance integration into suites of applications.andP;  This superiorityof performance and integration will probably be used to sell the idea thatusers ought to buy all their applications from one vendor.andP;  Only the big guyswill be able to make this pitch.andM;Win 3 vs.andP;  System 7andM;It seems likely that the things that Windows 3.0 and Mac System SoftwareVersion 7 have in common will define personal computer applicationdevelopment in the '90s.andM;Graphical user interfaces are here to stay.andP;  A serious push in the low end ofthe market by clone makers bundling Windows and Apple trying to redefineitself as a company will make it very hard to sell a DOS box.andP;  I've hinted atthis low-end war, but anyone who reads the weeklies or heard John Sculleyspeak at the Developer's Conference this spring knows that Apple is claimingto be ready to accept significantly lower margins to compete at the low endwith a line of high-volume, low-cost Macs.andP;  These machines will all runSystem 7 and will not, unless Apple blows it badly, be feeble machines.andP;  Theywill be competitive in price and performance with 386 clones running Windows3.0.andM;Multitasking, interapplication communication, and transparent networkaccesses will result in new kinds of applications.andP;  Large vendors willdevelop interlocking suites of applications rather than integrated packages.andO;Smaller vendors will develop small, targeted applications.andP;  Utilitydevelopers will come up with enhancement products that ride on otherproducts, sending messages to these products to get their work done.andO;Although this last scenario sounds a little like spreadsheet macros, there isa difference in control.andP;  A spreadsheet macro runs within the spreadsheetapplication and is vendor-specific; these utility applications use otherapplications but are separate, clickable applications, and they should workwith any applications that support the AppleEvents they generate.andM;Overall, Apple and Microsoft are saying, we'll see more, smallerapplications.andM;Applications will, more and more, take on a tool aspect.andP;  What, exactly, doesthis mean?andP;  Like all the preceding predictions, this is just what Apple andMicrosoft are telling developers.andP;  It would be an uncharitable exaggerationto say that the message Apple and Microsoft have for third-party developersis: &quot;We'll talk to the users; you just talk to us.&quot;andP;  That's not what they'resaying.andP;  Nevertheless, if the model of interprocess or interapplicationcommunication that Apple and Microsoft are pushing comes fully intoexistence, it would be conceivable for a user to use a product without everseeing its user interface.andM;Nobody is talking about what &quot;more smaller applications&quot; implies in thebattle for computer store shelf space.andM;The differences between Windows 3 and System 7 are less important than thesimilarities.andP;  Apple has the better user interface, but it's not clear thatthat will make any difference to anyone but current Mac users.andP;  I can't see aMac user converting happily to Windows, but the superiority of the Macinterface may not be great enough to affect buying decisions by present PCusers or new computer buyers.andM;One significant difference between the two systems has to do with their filesystems.andP;  Windows 3.0 still uses the short DOS file names and sometimesrequires the user to deal with DOS path names.andP;  More objectlike filemanagement tools are expected in the future, but right now the file handlinghas some kludgy aspects, and the DOS file names are unfriendly.andM;Mac's System 7 has a new file tracking system called &quot;Alias Manager.&quot;andP;  On thesurface, Alias Manager lets users create aliases, which are small files thatrefer to other files.andP;  Create several aliases for an application and you canstore the aliases in different folders.andP;  Click on any of the aliases and theoriginal application gets launched.andP;  The user doesn't have to worry aboutpaths, because the Alias Manager keeps track of the original even if it orthe aliases are moved or renamed.andM;The Alias Manager does more than permit aliasing of files, though.andP;  It is, asof System 7, the tool of choice for keeping track of files for any purpose.andO;The standard file facility will use it, so any application using StandardFile will get the benefits of Alias Manager from it.andP;  Alias Manager can beused for a wide variety of purposes.andP;  For one example, you put an alias forevery data file on your hard disk into a folder called archive, then archiveall the data files to floppy disks.andP;  Now when you click on the alias in thearchive folder, the Alias Manager will prompt you to insert the appropriatediskette.andP;  Since the alias files themselves are very small, this lets youcatalog all your diskettes.andP;  Aliasing volumes lets you kludge a simplenetwork manager.andP;  The highlight of the Alias Manager session at theDeveloper's Conference was the simple Adventure game created on the desktopwithout any programming simply by aliasing files and folders.andM;The alias manager works by maintaining alias records in memory, and employs awhole battery of heuristics for identifying the target volume and the target.andO;It is not easily confused by mere renaming or moving of the target, and willsearch across network zones and request mounting of volumes if necessary.andM;The discussion of Mac OS and Windows similarities and differences ought tolead to a discussion of porting strategies, or to a discussion of techniquesfor developing one program for both environments.andP;  A couple of years ago,Michael Brian Bentley wrote an interesting but intimidating book called TheViewport Technician (Scott, Foresman, 1988), about writing software formultiple windowing platforms.andP;  If it's getting easier to do that, and to endup with efficient programs, that would be news, but it's not clear that itis.andM;ToolBook vs.andP;  HyperCardandM;The porting problem has been addressed for two applications that will bebundled with Windows 3 and System 7: ToolBook and HyperCard.andP;  ToolBook, fromMicrosoft co-founder Paul Allen's company Asymmetrix, is a HyperCard-likesoftware construction kit that requires Windows 3.0.andP;  ToolBook substitutesthe page-in-book metaphor for HyperCard's card-in-stack metaphor and has somemore concrete differences with HyperCard as well, but it is definitelyintended to be the HyperCard equivalent for Windows.andP;  The latest version ofHyperCard, 2.0, has some powerful features, but it still lacks some of thecapabilities of ToolBook.andP;  The products are enough alike that Heizer Softwarehas already announced a product that converts HyperCard stacks into ToolBookbooks.andP;  I haven't seen it yet.andM;I have seen ToolBook, and I've seen HyperCard 2.0.andP;  I reviewed ToolBook inPersonal Workstation magazine recently, and will be writing more about it andHyperCard 2.0 here soon.andP;  What follows here is a look at how &quot;the hypertextproblem&quot; is handled by ToolBook and HyperCard 2.0.andM;In my June column I talked about ways in which some people have usedHyperCard and HyperTalk to do research into what could be called thehypertext problem.andP;  The problem is how to implement links in text, and thereis as yet no consensus on the proper way to do it.andP;  After writing thatcolumn, I got my hands on HyperCard 2.0.andP;  Apple did a better job of leavingthe developer's options open than I expected when I wrote that column, butstill didn't provide everything the hypertext author might want.andP;  Meanwhile,Windows 3.0 came out, and Asymmetrix finally got to release its ToolBook.andO;ToolBook runs under Windows 3.0 and is very comparable to HyperCard 2.0, butits approach to the hypertext problem differs fundamentally from HyperCard's.andM;The basic problem is this: Given a body of text, we want to be able to permitthe reader to click on part of the text and have something happen.andP;  The&quot;something&quot; is usually the display of further information on the subjectcovered in the clicked-on text.andP;  This is information that doesn't fit intothe linear structure of the running text: a definition, an optional detail, adigression.andP;  The further information may be displayed in any of a variety ofways: As a replacement text that takes the place of the clicked-on text, in apop-up field overlayed on the clicked-on field, or in another body of textlike the original body.andM;What I call the hypertext problem has two parts.andP;  The first part of theproblem is how to indicate to the user what can be clicked on.andP;  In linear,printed text, there are established conventions (for example, parentheses andfootnotes) for signalling a departure from strict linear structure.andP;  Thefootnote convention is the closest to what goes on in hypertext systems: Weuse a superscripted character to signal the existence of a link to a block oftext at the foot of the current page.andP;  Among the techniques proposed forsignalling hypertext links are superscripted characters, font changes, andboxes around text.andM;The other part of the hypertext problem involves that imprecise phrase,&quot;permit the reader to click on parts of the text.&quot;andP;  What could a hypertextauthor mean by &quot;part&quot;?andP;  Must every link be tied to a single word?andP;  Footnotesin linear printed text often refer to entire sentences or paragraphs,although there is often no visual cue to suggest this.andP;  Can the clickablezones in a hypertext document overlap; that is, can you arrange that asentence and a word in the sentence are each independently clickable, eachinvoking a different text link?andP;  Must clickable text be contiguous?andM;But this second part of the problem gets a little deeper than this.andP;  Does thelink pertain to a particular instance of the text, to any appearance of thattext in the text field, or to the nth word in the field, whatever it mightbe?andP;  For particular hypertext purposes, any of these might be desirable.andM;Case 1: Linking off a particular instance of a particular string.andP;  If youwant the link object (the clickable text) to have substance, so that itremains a functioning link even when you move it somewhere else, you probablywant something like this.andM;Case 2: Linking off any instance of a particular string.andP;  One excellent useof hypertext links is to provide definitions for technical terms in adocument.andP;  The author does not want to force the reader to look at thedefinition the first time a particular term is used, but wants to allow theuser to look up the word by clicking on any instance of the word in thedocument.andP;  The logic is that, for any particular use of the term, the usermay be able to work out part of its meaning from context or outsideknowledge, but may still need a definition later when the term is used in adifferent context.andP;  For this or a variety of other reasons, a full hypertextauthoring system ought to allow the author to create a single link for allinstances of a particular word or phrase.andM;Case 3: Linking off whatever string occupies a particular position.andO;&quot;Position&quot; here refers to text position in a document, not pixel location ona screen.andP;  This approach allows the author to create links that depend on thestructural features of a document.andP;  While this might not be useful for casualtext, it might make sense for highly formalized documents, such as a block ofassembly language code.andM;This is one way of slicing up some of the hypertext territory; these casesdon't cover all the possibilities or represent the only way to segment thepossibilities.andP;  I present them only to give some framework for looking atwhat ToolBook and HyperCard 2.0 actually do.andM;ToolBook and the Hypertext ProblemandM;ToolBook has two main ways to show the clickable text to the user.andP;  First,the cursor changes when passing over this text.andP;  Second, there is a facilityfor making all the links visible.andP;  One convenient time to do this is when thecursor passes over the text field.andP;  This technique puts a box around eachinstance of linking text.andP;  These two techniques are well thought out.andP;  Thecursor change does not use any element that might have another meaning in thetext, such as italics, and is perfectly obvious if you're looking for itwithout being terribly intrusive if you're not.andP;  The boxing also does not usea feature that you would want to use for other text purposes.andP;  The boxescould clash with other framing devices, and could look ugly, but since it canbe toggled on or off easily, this is not too serious.andP;  It's chiefly a peekingdevice for the user.andP;  You could also use font-style change to signal a link,since ToolBook lets you mix fonts and styles within a field, something thatHyperCard formerly did not do.andM;ToolBook implements links via hotwords.andP;  A hotword is an object withproperties, a script, and a place in the object hierarchy of ToolBook.andP;  Youcreate a hotword by selecting text and choosing a menu option that makes thattext a hotword.andP;  A hotword is a Case 1 link, a link off a specific instanceof text.andP;  You can move or copy it and the link moves with it, because thelink is defined by the script of the object.andP;  You can also edit the text of ahotword, although if you delete all its text, the object disappears.andM;HyperCard 2.0 andandM;the Hypertext ProblemandM;In June, I documented some of the contortions that HyperCard stack developerswent through to kludge some sort of hypertext facility in HyperCard.andP;  BecauseHyperCard and ToolBook both have programming languages, that sort ofroll-your-own hypertext is always possible.andP;  There's probably no approach tohypertext that can't be implemented, some way or other, with each of theseproducts.andP;  But hypertext systems have to have reasonable performance, andthat means that the hypertext abilities of these products depend on thetechniques built in.andP;  With Version 2.0, HyperCard has more hypertextcapabilities built in than it formerly had.andM;In the area of showing the clickable text to the user, HyperCard puts all thedecisions in the hands of the developer.andP;  Since there are different purposesfor hypertext and the jury is still out on the user-interface decisions, thisis generally the smart approach when you want to provide a flexible hypertextauthoring system.andP;  But the flexibility Apple offers is chiefly in font andstyle change, which is a usurpation of the features of text for the purposesof hypertext.andP;  One option for marking links that would not be at all easy toimplement in HyperCard is the ToolBook box, and messing with the cursor inHyperTalk could be problematic.andM;HyperCard implements links via field handlers.andP;  Text can be grouped,providing some of the capability of ToolBook's hotwords, and a field scriptcan examine attributes of the clicked word, clicked line, or arbitrarygrouping of clicked-on text.andP;  It's possible to test font or style and linkoff it, which is an interesting reversal: Instead of highlighting the link,you link off the highlight.andP;  HyperCard's field handler approach to hypertextmeans that you can key off any instance of a particular word or text with asingle handler (Case 2).andP;  Case 3 links are also fairly directly supported bythis scheme, but not Case 1 links.andM;Here are my closing thoughts on ToolBook, HyperCard, and the hypertextproblem:andM;The indication of links: This is hypertext; i.e., more than text.andP;  Toindicate the links, the author must add something to the text, and inparticular to the visual appearance of the text.andP;  I'm not sure that it iswidely understood that the indication of links raises spatial designproblems.andP;  Writers have not in the past had to deal with such issues, buthypertext authors, because they are working in more than one dimension, dohave to deal with spatial design in their documents.andP;  It is up to thehypertext author to create and indicate links without making the documentugly and unreadable.andM;What to link from: Between the two of them, HyperCard and ToolBook cover thelinking techniques I somewhat arbitrarily defined here.andP;  In my opinion, bothof them ought to provide the tools for creating any of the types of linksI've described, or any reasonable kind of link anybody might come up with, ifthey are to serve as general hypertext authoring systems.andP;  Neither, ofcourse, is being marketed as a general hypertext authoring system, but manypeople will be building hypertext documents with them.andP;  And until someonedemonstrates an unequivocally &quot;best&quot; way to implement hypertext links, thehypertext author should not be constrained to one or a few techniques.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
