In the Midwest, the Communications Workers of America met withofficials from American Information Technologies Corp.'s five Bellsubsidiaries _ Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin Bell_ to avert walkouts at 11:59 p.m. tonight, when three-yearcontracts expire for 37,000 union workers.   ``We're hopeful that we'll reach a settlement by the deadline,''said spokesman Larry Cose of Illinois Bell.   Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. issued a new contract proposalFriday in an effort to ward off a strike tonight, but a unionspokesman said the offer is inadequate.   ``It falls far short of acceptable levels in wages, health care,job security, working conditions, protection of retiree healthbenefits and other important areas,'' T.O. Parsons, vice presidentof District 6 of the CWA, said Friday. The union represents about40,000 Southwestern Bell employees in Missouri, Arkansas, Kansas,Oklahoma and Texas.   The proposal offers union employees guaranteed jobs and a biggerpay increase, but it still requires them to pay part of theirhealth insurance bills. The company has picked up the entire healthinsurance tab in the past.   Meanwhile, striking electrical workers Friday held their firstformal talks with Bell Atlantic since the strike began earlySunday. Bell Atlantic spokesman Thomas Duddy did not disclose theproposals exchanged by the two sides, but said it was encouragingnegotiations had resumed.   Representatives of more than 41,000 CWA members were scheduledto resume formal negotiations with Bell Atlantic on Saturday.   Three regional telephone company strikes began Sunday afternegotiations broke down over wage, health care and various localissues. Bell Atlantic operates in the District of Columbia,Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, New Jersey, Delaware andPennsylvania.   Strikes also continued against NYNEX Corp., which operates inNew York and New England, and Pacific Telesis, in California andNevada.   The strikes affected 157,000 union workers in 15 states. Thethree regional telephone companies are continuing operations byplacing managers in jobs normally held by union members.   In Boston, several hundred striking workers and their supportersshouted ``scab'' at phone company managers and customers whocrossed a picket line. One customer received a police escort toleave the building.   Myles Calvey, business manager of Local 2222 of theInternational Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, said the strikerswould not accept the company's demands to share in health insurancecosts, even if that meant a long strike.   ``You can't sell something like this when the membership doesn'twant it,'' Calvey said.   NYNEX has paid 100 percent of its employees' health insurancecosts for more than a decade, but now wants its workers tocontribute.   In New York, 32 of the state's union local presidents arescheduled to meet Tuesday to plan a campaign to urge a nationalphone bill boycott.   ``What we are going to do is put the word out across the countrythat people living in any struck area should not pay theirtelephone bills,'' said Rick Martini, a CWA official.</TEXT></DOC>
