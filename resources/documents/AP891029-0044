Cynthia Efird, the spokeswoman, said the Americans and twocaptured colleagues had been flown to Maputo from a militarycompound in northern Mozambique, where they were taken into custodylast week near the border with Malawi.   Ms. Efird said Mozambican authorities promised to give U.S.diplomats access to the captives after initial questioning wasconducted.   The state-run South African Broadcasting Corp. said the medicalteam apparently entered Mozambique illegally, but Ms. Efird saidshe did not know if charges would be filed.   Mozambique has been wracked by a guerrilla war since 1977.Hundreds of thousands of refugees have fled into Malawi, and theguerrillas of the Mozambique National Resistance have on occasionset up bases there.   The medical team was sent to the border area by the ChristianEmergency Relief Team, based in Carlsbad, Calif.   Kris Courson, the relief group's director of medical services,identified six American members of the team: Dr. Ken Daugherty, ofSan Diego; Dr. Fred Leist and his wife, Lucille, of Bremerton,Wash., Dr. John Cannon, a dentist from Davenport, Iowa, andparamedics Carol Roberts of Syracuse, N.Y., and Steve Sherrill ofStroudsburg, Penn.   Ms. Efird said there was a seventh American in the group, butshe did not release a name.   Also seized, according to the relief agency, was a South Africamissionary, George Bezuidenhout, and a man named Peter Hammond. Therelief agency said Hammond was South African, but Ms. Efird said heheld a British passport.   South Africa formerly aided the guerrillas in their war againstthe leftist government but signed a treaty in 1984 pledging to haltthis aid. The U.S. government supports the Mozambican government,although some right-wing groups in the United States oppose thispolicy and depict the rebels as freedom fighters.   Hundreds of thousands of Mozambicans have died and millions havebeen displaced because of the fighting and resultant foodshortages. The rebels have been widely accused of commitingmassacres and attacking mostly non-military targets.</TEXT></DOC>
