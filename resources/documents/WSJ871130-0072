The company plans to reduce the work force to 270,000 by 1990 from 295,000 as of September, the official said. NTT has already been reducing its staff; in 1982, it had 320,000 employees.    &quot;There's no definite structure to it yet,&quot; the official said about the plan for further cuts. &quot;We just have a general feeling that this is the result we would like to come to in the end.&quot;    Observers said the review is a response to pressures to reduce costs and increase efficiency as part of NTT's denationalization. The Japanese government has so far sold 25% of NTT to the public. </TEXT></DOC>
