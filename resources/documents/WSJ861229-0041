The pact gives the European aircraft group a boost in its bid to get the orders it needs to start production of the A-340. Airbus faces stiff competition from McDonnell Douglas Corp., which is expected to meet today to consider the production start-up of its rival MD-11 long-range jetliner. A McDonnell spokesman said no production decision has been made yet.    Airbus had been pitching the A-340 with a bolstered version of the CFM56-5 engine made by CFM International S.A., a joint venture of General Electric Co. of the U.S. and Societe Nationale d'Etude andamp; de Construction de Moteurs d'Aviation, or Snecma, of France.    The decision to offer two engines with the A-340, scheduled to go into service in 1992, should provide a sales boost for the long-range aircraft, according to Jean Pierson, head of Airbus.    IEA is a consortium of aero engine makers composed of Rolls-Royce Ltd. of Britain, United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt andamp; Whitney division, Japan Aero Engines Corp., Fiat Aviazione S.p.A. of Italy and Germany's MTU Motoren andamp; Turbinen-Union Muenchen G.m.b.H.    The new IAE engine, known as the V2500 Superfan, is a propeller-jet hybrid that is 12% more fuel efficient than current engines.    Separately, Snecma officials said Friday that Luftfahttechnik G.m.b.)H of West Germany has agreed to collaborate on development of the CFM56-5 engine. Other European companies involved in the CFM56-5 project include Belgium's Fabrique Nationale Herstal S.A. and Kongsberg Vapenfabrikk of Norway. Snecma officials suggested that other European companies may join the project. Airbus recently signed a letter of understanding with CFM for as many as 280 engines for the A-340.    Airbus also announced plans to offer a choice of two options for the aircraft -- an A-340-300 seating 294 passengers and a smaller A-340-200 seating 262.    The larger version would have a range of 7,100 nautical miles carrying a full passenger load, while the smaller one could fly 7,700 nautical miles, equivalent to a nonstop flight from New York to Hong Kong, the group said.    A final decision to proceed with building the A-340 is expected within three months. The decision will hinge on the level of British and West German funding for the project, and the willingness of airlines to commit themselves as launch customers. Airbus has said it needs orders from at least five airlines by the end of March. So far, Air France and Lufthansa AG have shown interest, but no firm orders have been booked.    Airbus said it &quot;is actively marketing the A-340 world-wide to some 15 major international airlines, which represent the potential launch-customer base for its new aircraft.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
