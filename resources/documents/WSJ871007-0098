At a congressional hearing exploring the financial accountability of television ministries, IRS Commissioner Lawrence Gibbs said current law &quot;imposes substantial impediments&quot; to the IRS effort to see that charitable contributions to these ministries aren't used for personal or business purposes.    Assistant Treasury Secretary Don Chapoton suggested that Congress consider establishing &quot;procedural safeguards against unreasonable compensation&quot; of ministry leaders. He added, however, that current laws governing tax-exempt organizations are &quot;by and large adequate.&quot;    Evangelists Jerry Falwell and Oral Roberts, testifying before the House Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee, said that religious organizations must be held accountable for how they spend the money they take in.    But other television ministers warned that imposing new procedures to investigate their organizations jeopardized the constitutional separation of church and state. &quot;This is the first time government has investigated churches in 200 years,&quot; said the Rev. James Kennedy, president of Coral Ridge Ministries of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.    Subcommittee Chairman J.J. Pickle (D., Texas) said the panel wasn't investigating ministries, but only the adequacy of current laws for overseeing organizations that solicit millions of dollars in tax-free contributions. He said there wasn't any legislation planned currently.    Yesterday's hearing was called in the wake of the recent PTL Ministry scandal, which led to questions about whether some tax-exempt religious organizations are using tax-deductible donations for personal enrichment or political activities, and whether the public is being kept in the dark about how contributions are spent.    &quot;People need to know if their money is being used for the Lord's work or for $1 million homes,&quot; said Rep. Byron Dorgan (D., N.D.).    Under present law, churches don't have to apply for tax-exempt status or file annual returns that other tax-exempt groups must file. And before the IRS can initiate an audit, it must meet the &quot;substantial hurdle&quot; of a &quot;reasonable belief&quot; of tax violations, Mr. Gibbs said. In response to a question, he said 25 audits of religious groups are under way.    Mr. Falwell, who now heads PTL as well as his own ministry, the Old-Time Gospel Hour, said he fully accepts the need for financial accountability and agrees that an exempt organization should pay tax on profits from unrelated business activities. He said that his ministry, for example, paid $2,063 in taxes last year on income received from renting its airplane to an offshoot organization, the Moral Majority, and from selling advertising in Fundamentalist Journal. </TEXT></DOC>
