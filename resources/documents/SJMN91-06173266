The task was harder than it sounds.;    The species involved wasTeen-age Mutant Ninja, whose likenesses have helped sell more than $1 billionworth of clothing, toys and movie tickets in the last five years.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  FOR A FEE, THEY'RE YOURSFIRMS PAY PLENTY TO LICENSE NAMES  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Their would-be emulators included the owners of cartoon characters, sportsteams and thousands of other properties, all hoping to lease their names orlogos to the consumer-product manufacturers who were also prowling theHilton's halls.;    All of them wanted a part of the $66 billion market forlicensed goods.;    Some of those attending the 11th annual InternationalLicensing and Merchandising Conference and Exposition were nearly flattened bya galloping bunch of Bart Simpson balloons.;    Others stopped to watch theDancin' Grannies, an elderly aerobics troupe from Arizona that wants to putits mark on food, vitamins and action wear for the senior set, as they prancedto a recording of &quot;Boogie-Woogie Bugle Boy of Company B.&quot; At another booth,Kilroy (of &quot;was here&quot; fame) peered from T-shirts and underwear.;    In all,161 exhibitors, a third more than last year, set up 356 booths to hawk theirproperties-for-hire.;    Their unabashed hucksterism belied the desultorystate of the American economy and underscored many manufacturers' andretailers' belief that planting a character on a carton or clothing canprovide a hedge against recession.;    &quot;In a recession, you're trying to buysome awareness, and licenses give you awareness for not a lot of added cost,&quot;said James R. Black, a vice president at Kenner Products, a Cincinnati-basedtoy company.;    According to surveys of manufacturers and retailers by TheLicensing Letter, an industry publication, $66 billion worth of licensed goodswere sold at retail last year, nearly a fivefold increase over the $13.6billion sold in 1981.;    Licensees typically pay licensors -- the owners ofproperties or their agents -- royalties of 5 to 10 percent of a product line'swholesale cost, said Murray Altchuler, the executive director of theInternational Licensing Industry Merchandisers' Association.;    Somelicensors and licensees have done fabulously. Major League Baseball Propertiesand NFL Properties each sell in excess of $1 billion worth of merchandiseannually, Altchuler said.;    Some at the show said the drive for novelty wasmisplaced, and maintained that the recession was pushing marketers to thetried-and-true names of yesteryear, like Bullwinkle J. Moose and Rocket J.Squirrel.;    Larry Tetenbaum said he had invested more than $500,000 in hisleap of faith into yesteryear.;    His company, Allegiance Advantage Inc. inNew York, was hawking &quot;Saints G'Lore,&quot; saints of the Roman Catholic Churchredesigned in contemporary fashion for use on greeting cards, clothing andother products.;    To prove the marketability of these &quot;ordinary people whodid extraordinary things,&quot; Tetenbaum pulled out charts projecting thepopulation growth of grandparents and other groups he considers his primarytargets.;    In the end, though, he said market research was beside the pointwhen it came to saints. &quot;I believe in them,&quot; Tetenbaum proclaimed.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  New York  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910621  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  9D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  529  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday June 21, 199100173266,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
