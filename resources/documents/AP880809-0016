Lowell Weicker of Connecticut sat aloneas he delivered an impassioned plea to a Republican Platform panel,urging his GOP brethren to stand firm against apartheid in SouthAfrica.   ``The regime in South Africa is no better than the regime inNazi Germany in the '30s,'' he said. ``That regime tried to do tothe Jewish people what South Africa is doing to the blacks.''   Weicker, playing a role he perfected in 1984, is practically thesole dissenter in this week's platform deliberations.   After Weicker's testimony, conservative activist Donald Devinesaid, ``It looks like Mr. Weicker is doing his usual thing: goingaround making a lot of noise and not getting any votes.''   Alone among prominent Republicans, Weicker has taken it uponhimself to push for some moderate-to-liberal platform planks,positions that are almost certain not to emerge from the draft fornext week's GOP platform.   Weicker also has prepared platform proposals calling for supportof the Equal Rights Amendment and an activist approach toward theAIDS crisis. He said he plans to press for adoption of the planksin drafting sessions later this week.   Weicker is generally unpopular among the conservative activistswho dominate the Republican platform process, and when histestimony ended, several subcommittee members unburdened themselvesof several polite but insistent questions about his anti-apartheidstand.   ``What about your call for support for front-line states ofsouthern Africa, including Marxist-run Angola?''   ``What further economic sanctions ... you said, an oil embargo,if necessary?''   While Weicker was tilting at windmills, witnesses who gavepresentations for the Strategic Defense Initiative, a continuationof Reagan administration economic policy and support for theNicaraguan rebels received general and positive queries thatenabled them to score easy points.   Fred Ikle, former undersecretary of defense, testified that theUnited States should maintain a steady growth in the defensebudget, continue its support for anti-communist rebels and worktoward the deployment of SDI, the missile defense system known asStar Wars.   The question to Ikle: ``What would have happened if the countryhad adopted Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis' views seven yearsago?''   Answer: ``We'd be in a period of crisis, rolling out the redcarpet for Soviet expansion ... and have no Intermediate-rangeNuclear Forces Treaty.''   Daniel Graham, the former head of the Defense IntelligenceAgency, testified that President Reagan's Star Wars plan is a``strategic master stroke,'' comparable to the ``LouisianaPurchase, the Monroe Doctrine and the Apollo space program.''   Graham's comments brought smiles to the faces of thesubcommittee members. There were no questions.   Weicker drew a few murmurs in the audience when he firstcompared South Africa to Nazi Germany, citing the government'spolicy of strict racial segregation of blacks.   When a panelist sought help to understand that view, Weickersaid:   ``South Africa has done by law exactly what Nazi Germany did bylaw,'' he responded.   His anti-apartheid plank would say: ``As the historical party ofindividual rights, the Republican Party rejects apartheid and seeksits abolition. We believe the United States has a moralresponsibility to impose, in concert with other nations, furthereconomic sanctions _ including an oil embargo, if necessary _ tobring this heinous practice to an end.''   Weicker agreed with his questioners that an oil embargo andother economic sanctions probably would hurt the United Statesfinancially, but pleaded with the panel's sense of humanity.   If that didn't work, there was Weicker's argument that theUnited States needed a stronger presence on the African continent,especially in the face of Marxist-led countries such as Angola.   And if that failed, there was always the comparison with theDemocrats, who in their platform labeled South Africa a terroriststate.   ``It shouldn't be a Democratic issue,'' Weicker said, notingthat a Republican-controlled Congress passed the initial economicsanctions against South Africa and a GOP Congress overrode Reagan'sveto.   And as he stood up, ready to leave the conference room, Weicker_ brandishing his Republicanism _ said defiantly, ``I'm not takinga back seat to the Democrats on any issue ... especially when theyhave a mealy-mouth platform.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Donna Cassata is an Associated Press reportercovering the 1988 campaign.</TEXT></DOC>
