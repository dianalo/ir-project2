<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-10-0855 </DOCNO><TEXT>In case of suspected intra-ocular or orbital tumours many different imagingtechniques, usually in combination, are being applied to confirm thediagnosis. A procedure has been set up to compare the predictive valueof each of the following methods: clinical ophthalmic examination, fluorescenceangiography, ultrasonography, computed tomography, magnetic resonanceimaging, pathology. In intra-ocular melanomas MRI appeared to be themost reliable technique concerning diagnosis. Extrabulbar extension wasnot conclusively predicted by any of the methods. The group of orbitaltumours is still too diffuse to draw conclusions from this study. 23refs.; 19 figs. Contains author index</TEXT></DOC>
