Soon after becoming defense secretary late last year, Frank Carlucci issued a directive encouraging the services to write weapons-development contracts that allow companies to recover their costs plus a profit. This reversed a 1985 move toward fixed-price contracts for the development of new weapons.    Fixed-price contracts protect the Pentagon from soaring costs by placing the risk of developing new weapons on the contractor. Former Navy Secretary John Lehman says the policy helped save taxpayers billions of dollars. However, &quot;given the magnitude of potential financial losses, such a policy is simply unfair for programs with significant risk,&quot; Robert Costello, undersecretary of defense for acquisitions, said in a memo to the military services. &quot;In the long run, if we don't deal fairly with our contractors, we will have fewer, and weaker, contractors willing to do our business.&quot;    At the same time, the Pentagon is quietly dropping an effort to make vendors invest heavily in development programs as a condition for competing to design and build new weapons. &quot;It isn't right to ask industry to do the work that properly belongs to the government,&quot; argues Gen. Bernard Randolph, commander of the Air Force Systems Command.    The Pentagon adopted both of these policies several years ago, when the Reagan administration's military buildup was at its peak. At the same time, disclosures that the military was paying outrageous prices for custom-made toilet seats and coffee pots were generating congressional and public demands for restraint.    More recently, however, the climate has changed. The military procurement budget has fallen to $83 billion in the current fiscal year from a peak of $110 billion in fiscal 1985, the Pentagon has appeared to tame extravagant purchasing practices, and some contractors have begun to complain that the military's procurement changes went too far.    In 1985, for instance, the Air Force ruled that companies vying to build its Advanced Tactical Fighter, a $35 billion program, had to build prototypes with their own money. This caused Hughes Aircraft Co. virtually to drop out of the competition for the new plane's radar. &quot;If you don't want the way the defense business is conducted these days, turn it down. Send a signal,&quot; Albert Wheelon, the chairman of Hughes, a General Motors Corp. unit, explained to Electronic News. Hughes Aircraft's dropout leaves the program with only one radar manufacturer, Westinghouse Electric Corp., and deprives the Air Force of the competition it wanted on major projects.    Similarly, Grumman Corp. didn't bid aggressively enough to stay in contention for the Navy's new plane, the Advanced Tactical Aircraft. &quot;We were unwilling to go to the wall for that contract,&quot; Grumman President John O'Brien says. &quot;To win, we would have had to bid a price that made no more business sense to me than the ATF program.&quot;    The reluctance of companies to compete for new work worries Pentagon officials and is one of the main reasons the Pentagon has pulled back the fixed-price development and pay-for-prototype policies.    In addition, Pentagon officials see signs that the policies to stimulate more corporate development spending aren't working. Annual self-financed research by major contractors dropped 4% to $4.9 billion in 1986 from two years before, Defense Department figures show. Over the same period the funds that those contractors had to spend yearly on bidding preparations rose 23% to $2.4 billion.    Gen. Randolph says the Air Force's next major award, for vehicles to launch military payloads into space, won't make excessive development cost demands on the contractors.    In response to industry appeals, Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D., N.M.), chairman of the Senate subcommittee on defense industry and technology, is holding hearings on Pentagon procurement policies this week. &quot;We're trying to arrive at a consensus on what to do about these reforms,&quot; the senator says. The House Armed Services Committee has indicated that it will support any reasonable breaks for the industry that Sen. Bingaman's subcommittee will recommend.    A number of the procurement changes adopted over the past few years as military contractors were benefiting from the Reagan defense buildup remain in place. One reduces progress payment rates -- the proportion of the contractors' work in progress that the Pentagon finances -- to 75% from the traditional 90%. The lower rates save the government some $12 billion a year, but all at the industry's expense. Contractors have to make up for the difference by borrowing from banks.    At the Senate hearings yesterday, Jerome Kwiatkowski, chairman of Corvus Systems Inc., a small defense electronics concern, said the reduction in progress payment rates is a way the Pentagon can &quot;borrow from me to finance the deficit&quot; but without &quot;paying me interest on my money.&quot;    Another change requires vendors to assume 50% of the costs of tooling up for new production. &quot;If the contractor is obliged to put up half the tooling costs, he'd be more careful about how he incurs them,&quot; says a Senate Armed Services Committee aide. Previously, the Pentagon reimbursed contractors for all of such costs.    Changes in procurement rules could have a big impact on the fortunes of defense contractors. Jerry Cantwell, an analyst for Wertheim Schroder andamp; Co., forecasts a 25% drop in earnings for the aerospace group by 1991 based on current spending trends and the assumption that most of these cash-squeezing policies will persist. &quot;If most of these difficulties are resolved these earnings would be flat instead,&quot; he says. Mr. Cantwell's guess is the industry will get about half of what it wants.    Some analysts dismiss the idea that the procurement rules are too tough. &quot;Have you heard of any major defense contractor going bankrupt?&quot; asks Dina Rasor, director of a Washington think tank lobbying for military reform. </TEXT></DOC>
