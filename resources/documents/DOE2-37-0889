Samples are taken from structural natural gas, surface gas seepage,water-dissolved natural gas and coal-field gas of the Japan Sea coastarea. The origins of primary hydrocarbons are classified into bacteriagas and thermogenic gas, the latter being subclassified into gas in oilproduction zone with the per million deviation of the carbon isotope({sup 13}C{sup 1}) of methane less than -35 and those gases with maturityhigher than this. Surface gas seepage is subjected to migration and bacterialoxidation. Coal gas is similar to oil gas. The CO{sub 2} concentrationis 0 - 2% and {sup 13}CO{sub 2} deviations from -30 - +30. The origincan be barely estimated from the isotopic composition because of thewide secondary change in the composition. The origin and migration ofgas from the gas field of northern Niigata are not similar to those inthe southern area, which consist of a thermal decomposition origin only,independent of the depth and age. Gases from the northern area are mixturesof those of young formations containing a lot of bacterial gas and thoseof oil formations with more thermogenic gas. This distribution is attributableto the geological structure. (11 figs, 33 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
