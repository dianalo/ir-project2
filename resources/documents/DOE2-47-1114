This analysis is required for calculation ofcarbon and volatile content in coal samples. The proposed standard TGL14483 follows the COMECON standard 4385-83 with some alterations concerningsampling and coal density determination. The laboratory apparatus isdescribed as well as required reagents, the equation to calculate thecarbon dioxide content and the permissible analysis error. The analysis,in short, consists in boiling 3 to 5 g coal samples with 30 cm{sup 3}hydrochloric acid for 15 min and weighing the mass increase in absorptionvessels. The permissible error should not exceed 3 to 5%.</TEXT></DOC>
