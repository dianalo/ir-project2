U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland confirmed the plan, more than three years in the making, in December. The big building-materials and forest-products concern filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection in August 1982, amid a flood of lawsuits claiming death, disease or property damage from asbestos. The mineral, once widely used in piping and insulation, causes deadly diseases that often don't show up for years.    Various groups are objecting to details of the plan, which contemplates paying victims of asbestos disease about $3 billion over the next few decades through a trust fund. Attorneys representing victims of asbestos-related diseases have objected to clauses in the plan that bar punitive damages and shield the company from further lawsuits. (Future claims must be made against the trust fund.) Holders of Manville common shares, the only creditor group that rejected the plan, also have filed appeals; they face as much as a 98% dilution of their stake.    Manville said it doesn't expect to emerge from bankruptcy-court protection before early 1988. Under Chapter 11, a company continues to operate under protection from creditors' lawsuits while it works out a plan to pay its debts. </TEXT></DOC>
