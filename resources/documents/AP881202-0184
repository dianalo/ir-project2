He plays an American arms negotiator named Honeyman strollingthrough the woods of Geneva enmeshed in talks with his Sovietcounterpart, Andrey Botvinnik, played by Guinness.   ``I don't know how I got stuck in this preppy mold,'' said theactor, who specializes in playing the clenched, close-to-the-chestemotions that go with Honeyman's starched, well-heeled appearance.   He played similar types as T.S. Eliot in the 1984 play ``Tom andViv'' and as Brock, the stuffy upper-class Briton, in David Hare's``Plenty,'' opposite Kate Nelligan, for which both he and Nelliganreceived Tony nominations.   He played Franklin Delano Roosevelt in two TV movies, with JaneAlexander as Eleanor.   ``I didn't go to prep school. If anything, after playing FDR, Iwas afraid I was going to be typed in comedies, loony comedies,''said Herrmann.   Herrmann, 45, turned up for an interview at a Chelsea pub dressedin the natty style his latest role demands. ``The character in theplay wears a tie, and there's a value in keeping in the clothes youare going to play in,'' he said.   He took the role solely for the chance of acting opposite thegreat Guinness, having turned down offers to do it at the YaleRepertory Theater in New Haven, and on Broadway last February.   ``When I heard Sir Alec wanted to do it, it was something Iwanted to put my hat in the ring for,'' said Herrmann. ``The wayAlec does it, it's just a charmer.''   Robert Prosky and Sam Waterston performed ``A Walk in the Woods''for four months in New York, where it received a Tony nomination forbest play. The British production, directed by Ronald Eyre, receivedmixed reviews for the writing but near-raves for the stars. Herrmannis contracted for six months plus a British tour if Guinness iswilling.   A New York stage veteran, Herrmann won a 1976 Tony for ``Mrs.Warren's Profession'' at Lincoln Center. He appeared last winterwith Al Pacino and Martin Sheen in ``Julius Caesar,'' the second inJoseph Papp's series of Shakespeare productions at the PublicTheater.   All three actors, and the production itself, were panned.   Said Herrmann: ``I was crushed. I'd been vain about my ability tospeak blank verse because I really could, (and) the other guysdidn't know what it was.''   But after the reviews, he said, ``I banged my head around for along time.''   He has been banging about on-screen, as well.   A familiar movie face for over a decade, he appeared in ``ALittle Sex,'' ``Annie'' and ``Reds'' and, more recently, in``Overboard,'' ``The Lost Boys,'' and the Bette Midler-Lily Tomlincomedy ``Big Business.''   The latter movies offered the chance to play ``three absolutelywhacked-out people,'' especially the role of a vampire in ``LostBoys.''   ``People asked, `Aren't you afraid of playing a vampire?''' herecalled. ``Are you kidding? I'd kill to play a vampire. It wasgreat.''   Herrmann likes equally working in movies and theater.   ``Acting is acting. It's just the way you pitch it,'' he said.``In a movie, the room is the size of the room. On the stage, theroom is the size of the stage. It's a question, I think, oftechnique rather than difference in kind. You just have to use adifferent set of muscles.''   Herrmann studied on a Fulbright scholarship to the London Academyof Music and Dramatic Art in 1968-69.   ``England has had a big influence on my life; I feel very at homehere,'' he said. ``They listen much better here. They're keyed tolanguage.   ``(But) that has its dangers. They've seen so much theater, theymay not be aware you're trying something really new. They may expecta performance to fit a certain pattern.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PM Fri Dec. 9</NOTE></DOC>
