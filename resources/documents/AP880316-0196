The White House said the president of Honduras, Jose Azcona,asked for American assistance in trying to repel the Nicaraguanforces, but White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said he couldnot say whether that request included a plea for military help.   The Honduran ambassador put the number of Nicaraguan troops inhis country as in the thousands, but Nicaragua today stronglydenied that its soldiers had entered Honduran territory.   ``We have never invaded Honduras and we have never invaded anyneighboring country,'' said Maj. Rosa Pasos, a Nicaragua DefenseMinistry spokeswoman. ``So we totally deny those declarations madethis morning by the White House.''   Reagan, asked whether he was considering any use of U.S.military forces, replied, ``We've been in consultation with theHonduran government but I can't comment on anything.''   He said that ``the information we have is that Nicaragua hascrossed the border into Honduras. Obviously we're concerned.''   Speaking separatel, the Honduran ambassador, Roberto Martinez,said that here a had been a ``penetration into Honduran territoryof a number, ... definitely in the thousands, of Sandinista troops.   ``At this moment, we are trying the utmost to obtain a clearingof the area, ... a total withdrawal, immediate withdrawal, of theSandinista troops from our territory.''   But he said his government hoped to avoid military action.   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan, hisnational security adviser, the secretary of state and others ``haveconferred at length in the last 24 hours concerning the Nicaraguaninvasion of Honduran territory.''   Fitzwater did not spell out what options were being considered,except he did say that ``the Organization of American States willbe asked to consider the issue, and the presidents of Guatemala,Costa Rica and El Salvador, will present their views.''   He said the administration no longer is thinking of working withCongress on an aid package to simply provide the resistance forceswith food, medicine, and other supplies, but not arms.   Fitzwater said that Secretary of State George Shultz, nationalsecurity adviser Colin Powell and White House chief of staff HowardH. Baker Jr., were being dispatched to Capitol Hill to briefcongressional leaders. He said they would ``review a menu ofoptions and will probably make decisions after that.''   House Speaker Jim Wright said he could not immediately evaluatereports that Sandinista troops had crossed into Honduras.   ``If true, that would be a very serious matter and wouldintroduce an element of gravity that could profoundly alter thesituation,'' including the willingness of Congress to vote forfurther aid of some kind for the rebels, he told reporters.   But Wright said he still does not believe support exists inCongress for any kind of renewed military aid for the rebels, andrepeated that congressional Democrats remain willing to talk abouta further package of purely ``humanitarian'' aid.   Fitzwater said that 1,500 Nicaraguan troops were inside Hondruasand that an additional 4,500 appeared to be in a staging area tocross the border.   Fitzwater told reporters that ``all options are underconsideration. At this moment, everything is being considered shortof (U.S.) invasion.''   Fitzwater commented one day after Reagan met with Democratic andRepublican congressional leaders. He failed to persuade theDemocratic leaders to get behind a new package of humanitarian aidfor the Contras.   Congressional sources, declining to be named, said at themeeting Reagan pounded the table and said, ``There are some peoplearound this table who don't seem to know who the bad guys are downthere.''   Today, Fitzwater said, ``More than 1,500 Sandinista troops arenow inside Honduras, attacking freedom fighter camps in an effortto destroy their remaining supplies.''   He added:   ``There are nearly 4,500 Sandinista forces with stronghelicopter support moving into the Bocay Valley, which is justbelow the Honduran border. They've established a new base for thisoperation ... .   ``In the last several hours, the United States government hasbeen in contact with the presidents of the other three democraticgovernments in the region,'' he said. ``We've had discussionsconcerning their response to this incursion and its meaning for theGuatemala peace plan.''   ``The United States government today is examining its options,''he said.   When first word of the Sandinista operation came Monday night,Democratic sources in Congress portrayed it as a Nicaraguan attemptto strengthen their position in advance of cease-fire talks withthe Contras, scheduled to begin Monday.   Today, one senior administration official, speaking on thecondition of anonymity, said the Sandinista drive appeared to beaimed at a Contra camp complex and supply depot.   If the depot is knocked out, ``there will be nothing left'' ofthe Contra war effort, the source said.   That official said that Contra commander Enrique Bermudez is inthe Bocay region and may be in ``serious trouble'' because he andhis forces are surrounded by Sandinista troops.   Nicaragua did not report the offensive until Tuesday evening,when a Defense Ministry spokesman said it was under way but deniedContra claims that Sandinista troops crossed into Honduras, wherethe rebels have bases.   ``The army has undertaken major offensive operations. ...Reports that the army has penetrated Honduras are not true,'' thespokesman said.   Today, however, another official of the Defense Ministry wouldneither confirm nor deny that its troops had invaded Honduras.   ``We're looking into the reports,` an officer said. ``It'sserious and that's why I can't say yes or no.'' Both Nicaraguanswould not be identified.   The Honduran Defense Ministry said that 43 people had beenkilled in the Sandinista initiative.   Heavy fighting was reported throughout Nicaragua's 5th MilitaryRegion, which includes Boaco, Chontales, Rio San Juan and ZelayaSouth. The Contras said Sandinista troops had overrun some rebelpositions.   Fitzwater was peppered with questions about whether theadministration was considering any use of U.S. military forcesstationed in Honduras and in nearby areas.   ``The president has said many times that he does not plan tointroduce invasion forces in Central America,'' Fitzwater said.``We have said in the past, and it still holds true, that we do notplan to invade. ... That certainly hasn't changed.''   But Fitzwater also said, ``At this moment, everything is beingconsidered, short of invasion.'' But later he said ``nothing isruled out at this point.''   ``I'm trying to be as restrained as possible,'' the spokesmansaid under intense questioning about U.S. military intentions.``I'm telling you not to draw that signal (of direct U.S. militaryinvolvement), but we're in the midst of discussions.''   Fitzwater said that administration officials had consulted bytelephone late Tuesday with congressional leaders and theirrepresentatives.</TEXT></DOC>
