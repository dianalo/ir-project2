 The importance of informationsystems has grown as corporate executives clamor for high-quality informationon which to base their business decisions.andP;  Corporations are demandinginformation systems that are flexible enough to meet changing businessrequirements while maintaining the stability and reliability to which theseorganizations have become accustomed.andM;Structured analysis and design tell us that modularity is the key toflexible, stable applications.andP;  The processes required to support anapplication are dissected into discrete modules.andP;  Each operates as a blackbox, with external interfaces defined in terms of input and responsemessages.andP;  The way a given module achieves its objective should betransparent to other interfacing modules.andP;  Changes to a module's internalprocessing should have no impact on the external environment, so long as theinterface messages do not change.andM;Unfortunately, little guidance is provided about how to determine the optimalset of independent modules that can be integrated into a working application.andO;How do you ensure that each business process is supported by exactly oneapplication module?andP;  Or that one module does not support two independentbusiness processes?andP;  How do you identify redundant business processes andcontrol the degree to which redundant modules are implemented?andM;The information engineering discipline deals with these issues with respectto data.andP;  It has a framework to help identify an enterprise's informationrequirements and transform them into a database design that controls dataredundancy while optimizing performance.andP;  Information modeling, the rules ofdata normalization, and data-naming standards are some of the methodologiesthat serve as guidelines to data and database analysts.andM;For the most part, the information engineering analysis and design frameworkis independent of any specific computer technology.andP;  It works equally well indeveloping an application targeted for dBASE as it does for DB2 or IMS.andM;Function analysis and design can benefit from similar technology-independentguidelines for categorizing business processes in a manner that leads toatomic, nonredundant modules.andP;  Frameworks of this sort are often referred toas application architectures.andM;Architecture overviewandM;One useful application architecture is based on the increasingly popularclient-server concept.andP;  This three-layered architecture consists of:andM;* Information management--processes that ensure the integrity of and provideaccess to the enterprise's information assetandM;* business function management--processes the enterprise must perform tocompete in its chosen industries and marketplacesandM;* Delivery management--processes required to manage events the applicationmust react to, letting it interface with the external world.andM;The processes categorized in one layer communicate with others in theadjacent layer via well-defined Request and Reply messages (Figure 1).andM;Information management processes are atomic functions that cause changes inthe state of the application's databases or files.andP;  They usually involveadding and deleting records in a file or rows in a table, or changing thevalue of a specific data element in a record or row.andM;Business function management processes are designed to achieve specificbusiness tasks.andP;  For a bank, business functions include Open A CheckingAccount, Establish a Customer Relationship, Process a Deposit, or Print aStatement.andP;  For a video store, they would include Purchase a Movie on a VideoTape, Rent a Tape, Check In a Returned Tape, and Print Late Notices.andP;  Abusiness function process coordinates the interface between the delivery andinformation management layers.andP;  Such a process may have to interface withseveral other business function processes and one or more informationmanagement processes.andM;Often, the same business function is invoked by many different users.andP;  Theapplication's interface with different users must be customized to meet theirneeds.andP;  Delivery management processes must coordinate those dialogs,interfacing with the appropriate business function processes.andP;  A dialog tocomplete a deposit transaction through a bank's teller workstation is verydifferent from one conducted with a customer using an automated tellermachine.andP;  Both processes end up invoking the same Do a Deposit businessfunction, but the techniques used to gather account and deposit amountinformation, secure money, and respond to the user are very different.andM;Architecture usesandM;How does this approach to analyzing and structuring processes lead to moreflexible applications?andM;Using the layered application architecture to develop requirements and todesign and implement systems, optimizing the sharing of code and designcomponents throughout the application.andP;  Once process requirements have beenspecified, modeled, and validated (or a module has been designed, coded, andtested), they become building blocks for reuse in future evolutions of theapplication.andM;This architecture can be used as a framework for conducting requirementsanalysis, making application distribution decisions, designingimplementations, and scoping the impact of enhancements.andM;Requirements analysisandM;This architecture can be used to validate the requirements specified duringthe business analysis sessions.andP;  Examining the same system from differentperspectives can yield new insights.andP;  Different approaches are often used toanalyze the business requirements that reside at the different layers of theapplication architecture.andM;I prefer these methodologies:andM;* Information management layer -- information modelingandM;* Business function layer -- entity life history modelingandM;* Delivery management layer -- essential systems analysis event modeling.andM;When different methodologies are integrated to define requirements, theresulting check-and-balance phenomenon helps validate the correctness ofthose requirements.andM;I prefer to start requirements analysis at the information management levelby developing a high-level entity relationship diagram of the businessobjects to be supported.andP;  I then derive the business function processes byanalyzing the life cycle through which each entity evolves.andP;  I use essentialsystems analysis to ensure that no essential process, entity, or datum wasoverlooked during prior analysis.andM;However, any layer can serve as the starting point in defining and validatingbusiness requirements.andP;  In fact, I often set aside my preferences to satisfythe comfort level of the business user and requirements analysis team.andP;  It'smore important that the system be reviewed from all three perspective than toforce analysis to begin at one specific layer.andM;Distribution decisionsandM;As PC workstations proliferate and local area networks (LANs) mature, manyinformation systems organizations are exploring application distributionalternatives.andP;  The application architecture can serve as a framework toanalyze process distribution strategies.andM;The challenge in implementing a distributed application is to ensure thatdata integrity is maintained for update transactions.andP;  Distribution is more adata problem than a process concern.andP;  Most DBMSs are not equipped to ensuredata correctness when the data is distributed across multiple computers.andP;  Fewsystems have implemented an update assurance strategy, such as two-phasecommit, which ensures that all of a transaction's updates occur correctly orthat none occur.andM;Processes that maintain the data should be placed in the same environment asthe data.andP;  If the data is entirely local to a given PC, it is appropriate tomaintain that data and its information management processes within that PC.andO;However, if the data must be accessible across a department supported by aLAN or the entire corporation, it is best to maintain this data through themore traditional central database server approach.andP;  If the data cannot bedistributed, the supporting information management processes probably cannotbe distributed either.andM;However, processes that do little data management, such as deliverymanagement processes, are prime candidates for distribution.andP;  It makes senseto locate these processes as close to the user as possible.andM;The real challenge is determining placement of the business functionprocesses.andP;  Often this decision is entirely technology-driven.andP;  Normally, abusiness function represents the span of control for a database transaction.andO;For an update function, if it is not possible to complete the processing forthe entire business function, none of the processing should be done.andP;  If yourDBMS cannot support distributed updates, the business function processes thatcoordinate data manipulation should be located in the same environment astheir data.andM;Implementation designandM;An application architecture is a conceptual framework to assist in analysisand design of an application's processes.andP;  It is not meant to force aspecific implementation design.andP;  The degree to which an application canactually implement the framework is a factor of the selected technology.andM;The architecture can almost be implemented verbatim for applicationsutilizing procedural languages and technology where DBMS functions areseparated from telecommunication functions.andP;  Systems running on IBMmainframes under CICS, IMS, and embedded DB2 fall into this category.andM;However, it may not make sense to implement this architecture forapplications being implemented with a fourth-generation language in which thedata to be accessed and the format in which the data is to be displayed canbe coded in a single query.andP;  In this case, the technology can support modulesthat cut across all three layers of the architecture.andP;  The ease of programdevelopment using a fourth-generation language can outweigh the flexibilitylost in the application's design.andP;  With these languages, it is often betterto develop new code to meet changing business requirements than to attempt toenhance the existing code.andM;Even if you decide to use the architecture to design an application'simplementation, sometimes controlled process redundancy must be introduced.andO;In database design, this activity is called denormalization.andP;  Processredundancy occurs when the code to support a process is implemented in morethan one module.andP;  The primary reason for introducing redundancy is to improveperformance.andM;Whenever a process is implemented in more than one module, the tradeoff inincreased maintenance costs must be considered.andP;  If the business requirementchanges, that change must be implemented in several places.andP;  Finding all themodules the process was implemented in can be a maintenance nightmare.andM;Application impact analysisandM;The greatest benefit of casting your application into this framework isachieved when it's time to enhance the application.andP;  The application has beenconstructed from a set of modules that can be bonded in a building-blockfashion.andP;  Many new functions can be supported by simply adding new processesand reusing existing ones.andM;When the business user specifies new requirements, identify which layer(s) ofthe architecture the supporting processes fall into.andP;  Then determine whetherthe new functionality can be supported by simply bundling together ormodifying existing processes.andM;For example, if the users request additional facts to be maintained about abusiness entity the application already supports, the information managementprocesses supporting that entity need to be examined for impact.andP;  Likewise,it is necessary to determine which business function processes will utilizethe new data and which delivery management processes will capture or displaythat data.andP;  Changes in the information management layer have the greatestimpact on the application.andM;If the user requests changes to an existing business function or wants to adda new business function, determine whether new business entities or facts arerequired.andP;  If not, the function can be implemented by invoking existinginformation management processes.andP;  You will need to determine whether the newbusiness function can be implemented by invoking existing business functionprocesses.andP;  If not, new business function processes will have to bedeveloped.andP;  Likewise, you will have to identify whether any deliverymanagement processes must be changed to support the business functionenhancements.andP;  In some cases, new delivery management processes will alsohave to be developed.andM;Requirements involving only changes in the delivery management layer have theleast impact on the application structure.andP;  Since the delivery managementlayer can only invoke existing business function processes, changes to adelivery process rarely impact processes in the other two layers.andM;With a well-documented application, the impact of a change or enhancement canbe ascertained fairly quickly.andP;  If an automated information repository isused to document the requirements and module implementation, impact can bedetermined even faster.andM;Application architecture's rootsandM;This application architecture evolved as part of a large development projectfor a major East Coast bank in the early 1980s.andP;  The application was beingimplemented on Tandem computers, which force separation of screen dialogprocesses from database manipulation.andP;  Tandem's implementation of COBOLprovided file manipulation commands like Read and Write, but noscreen-processing commands.andP;  The Screen COBOL (SCOBOL) language supportedscreen-processing commands but no file-manipulation verbs.andP;  In this case, theimplementation technology necessitated a two-layered application architecturethat separated delivery processes from data manipulation processes.andM;It isn't often that technology-enforced constraints can be fortuitous indeveloping a technology-independent application architecture, but Tandem'sstructure provided a beneficial impetus to our endeavors.andP;  This applicationwas intended to evolve to a distributed system using intelligent workstations(soon to be known as personal computers) attached to a statewide network.andO;The data would be managed by distributed database machines.andP;  Since most ofthe selected technology was experimental, we needed to be able to change oneaspect of the system with minimal impact to the rest of the application.andM;By inserting a middle layer into the delivery-data manipulation architecture,we achieved an application architecture, we achieved an applicationarchitecture that could provide a framework for segmenting modules tominimize the impact of changes in technology.andP;  We also achieved anarchitecture that could be used as a guide during requirements analysis tosimilarly categorized business functions to minimize the impact of businessenvironment changes on the supporting applications.andP;  Thus the deliverymanagement/business function/informatio management application architecturewas born.andM;I later discovered that the same application architecture had independentlyevolved at a large West Coast financial institution.andP;  The technology used toimplement this architecture was totally different than that used by the firstbank.andP;  For this reason, I'm confident that this architecture cab serve as auseful framework for information-driven industries such as financialservices.andP;  In fact, I have yet to conceive of any business information systemthat can't be supported by this type of an application architecture.andM;Applying the Application ArchitectureandM;To illustrate how this application architecture is used to reduce processredundancy in an application, let's examine a bank transfer transaction (seebelow).andP;  A transfer is a common financial business function in which fundsare withdrawn (or debited) from one account and deposited (or credited) toanother.andM;A transfer can be initiated by a customer using an ATM or home bankingterminal, by a teller through the teller workstation, or because somepredefined condition triggers an automatic transfer.andP;  Processes that detectthe transfer event request reside within the delivery management layer.andM;The fund-transfer process is housed at the business function level, alongwith the Withdrawn/Debit Funds and Deposit/Credit Funds processes.andP;  The FundsTransfer process coordinates the interaction between the other businessfunctions and information management processes that actually satisfy thetransfer event request.andP;  The business function layer breaks the request intomessages that can be forwarded to the appropriate business function andinformation managment processes.andP;  It consolidates the response into onemessage that can be sebt back to the requesting delivery management process.andM;The funds transfer process receives only one Request message.andP;  However, itcan reply with several response messages based on the outcome of theindividual processes performed.andP;  Normally, there is one Function SuccessfullyCompleted message and at least one error response message format.andM;The Wirhdrawal/Debit Funds and Deposit/Credit Funds business functionprocesses interact with the information management processes.andP;  Three suchprocesses participate in the Funds Transfer business function: &quot;RetrieveAccount Balance,&quot; &quot;Debit Account Balance,&quot; and &quot;Credit Account Balance.&quot;andP;  TheRequest message received from the business function processes identifyapplicable accounts and the transfer amount.andM;Information management processes don't make any decisions.andP;  They simply dothe requested job and respond with the result.andP;  All processing to determinewhether the transaction will continue or be aborted is left in the hands ofthe business function layer.andM;If the Withdrawal/Debit Account process resulted in a negative accountbalance, this state would be reported to the invoking business functionprocess.andP;  The business function would decide what action should be taken toresolve the irrational account state.andP;  This might involve the ResolveOverdraft business function or simply responding to the invoking deliverymanagement process that the request cannot be satisfied.andM;Terry Moriarity is a senior data administrator with a large bank in SanFrancisco, Calif.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
