The MDU system, which was developed by the Central ElectricityGenerating Board for ISI of nuclear power plant, permits ultrasonic indicationsexceeding threshold on the ultrasonic flaw detector screen to be automaticallyrecorded and the resulting defect image displayed in cross-sectional,plan or elevation views. Development of MDU based inspection proceduresfor a number of separate applications will be described - defect fingerprintingon thick walled pressure vessels, critical sizing on offshore structures,application to corrosion mapping. The procedures used have been devisedto provide an approach which integrates the results obtained on defectsizing by MDU with size estimates by conventional means to enhance theoverall reliability of assessment. Consideration is also given to equipmentcharacterisation to ensure reproducibility of inspection at successiveISI intervals.</TEXT></DOC>
