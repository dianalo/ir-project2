Maybe if we can get congressional leaders to design a program aimed at eliminating affluence, they will inadvertently make us all rich.    Unfortunately, nobody recently has been wacko enough to argue against prosperity. Until now. Harper's Magazine editor Lewis H. Lapham has a new book.    Mr. Lapham provides the rhetoric and ideas (loosely defined) congressional leaders will need to launch the War on Affluence. In &quot;Money and Class in America: Notes and Observations on Our Civil Religion&quot; (Weidenfeld andamp; Nicolson, 244 pages, $18.95), Mr. Lapham argues that &quot;the rich have the temperaments of lizards, and their indifference to other people's joy or sorrow bears comparison to the indifference of stones.&quot;    Does Mr. Lapham mean that the rich are stonelike lizards or lizardlike stones? Well, he does make one thing very clear: The rich are not human. &quot;To describe the rich as people is often to make a mistake with the language. . . . The rich tend to identify themselves with sums of money, and by doing so they relinquish most of their claims to their own humanity.&quot;    Never one to allow reality to ruin a provocative observation, Mr. Lapham is especially imaginative when it comes to statistics. Twenty percent of those who live in homes in which the household income exceeds $114,000 are under indictment for theft or fraud, he claims. Eighty percent are estranged from their children, 75% complain of chronic depression, &quot;4 of 8&quot; (that's half, in case you don't have Mr. Lapham's knack for numbers) are cocaine addicts. But these are minor complaints for Mr. Lapham, relegated to a footnote. What really offends him is that the rich are vulgar, or as he puts it: They go &quot;about the vulgar business of making vulgar fortunes.&quot;    While the prosperous rank pretty poorly in Mr. Lapham's estimation, there is one other group that is similarly despised -- nearly everybody else. The U.S., he says, has &quot;taken upon itself the persona of a rich man.&quot; This is, apparently, because Americans, in their boorishness, tend to show a fondness for money.    Though Mr. Lapham seems especially disgruntled in the '80s, when more people are getting richer than ever before, he has unkind things to say about Americans of all generations. Most of the delegates to the Constitutional Convention in 1787 get dismissed as rich men who &quot;detested both the theory and the practice of democracy.&quot; And later in our history, &quot;The winning of the West was accomplished by greedy and ignorant men, looking for something for nothing, governed by their basest instincts.&quot;    Today, Mr. Lapham insists, &quot;we live in a society that cares as much about the humanities as it cares about the color of the rain in Tashkent.&quot; The American public allegedly permits a politician to &quot;keep as many mistresses as he can afford.&quot; Government &quot;has little or no intention of doing anything to reduce the crime implicit in drug traffic.&quot; Our cities &quot;have the feeling of nomad camps.&quot;    Whereas the citizenry of the early 1960s had to endure the anguished cries of the Angry Young Men, we are now burdened with the sour rumblings of Grumpy Old Codgers. Mr. Lapham is certainly right, as John Kenneth Galbraith pointed out back in 1965, that moral standards in a capitalist economy have a hard time keeping up with ever-burgeoning affluence. But Mr. Lapham hyperexaggerates the squalid -- show him a classic Rolls-Royce and he looks up the tailpipe -- so he has nothing constructive to say.    This book seems to have been written in a fit of contrarian mischeviousness, as if the author were craving bad reviews. He also is a freethinker, free to the point of formless and self-contradictory. Sometimes he sounds like Abbie Hoffman, and other times like Milton Friedman; sometimes like Allan Bloom, other times like the lead guitarist of Iron Maiden. It is very difficult to piece together what sort of lives Mr. Lapham thinks we should lead. I suppose his hero would be an aristocratic intellectual who is also a first-generation entrepreneur. He also would be extremely successful, but totally nonacquisitive, disinterested in material success, and blissfully unaware of how rich he is.    Finally, there is the curious matter of Mr. Lapham's relationship with his family. Part of this book is autobiographical, but not enough so. Mr. Lapham was born into a family of great wealth and standing in San Francisco, but somewhere along the line, someone, either his grandfather or his father, frittered the money and status away. He is so sketchy on these matters that he practically demands that his reader play analyst. It's embarrassing to watch what one imagines are private psychological conflicts as they play themselves out in the form of hyperbolic analysis of society.    The best thing we all can do for Mr. Lapham is not buy his book. If it becomes a best seller, he will become rich (or richer), and then he'll have to despise himself. </TEXT></DOC>
