The rocket was sighted in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas,Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Mississippi and Iowa, and a number ofwitnesses called officials to say they had seen it blaze across thesky about 8:10 p.m. CST.   Some witnesses said the fireball had fiery tail 30 to 40 mileslong.   Maj. Dick Adams, a spokesman for the North American Air DefenseCommand in Colorado Springs, Colo., said the U.S. Space Commandidentified the object as a Soviet-built rocket body that waslaunched sometime last year.   ``It came down about 9 p.m. EST,'' Adams said. ``There is no wayto know as to what happened to it.''   The space command tracks about 7,100 manmade objects and oncethey start to notice an object falling out of orbit they try topredict its re-entry, Adams said.   Adams said the object would not be positively identified untilSaturday.   Earlier in the evening, before the rocket body was tentativelyidentified, Navy Cmdr. Dugald Gillies, deputy director of publicaffairs for the U.S. Space Command, said the Space SurveillanceCenter was monitoring the object.   ``We've gotten many calls as well,'' Gillies said. ``To the bestof our estimation, it would be a re-entering of a Soviet rocket bodyfrom a launch that took place last year.   ``(That's) as much detail as we have. (It was) one of the objectsthat we track. This re-entry correlates with what we were tracking.''   He said the sightings were made better because of weather thatwas clear and perfect for such sightings.   A dispatcher at the Oklahoma Highway Patrol said the office hadreceived calls from ``all over the state.'' ``Altus, Enid, Pawnee,Muskogee ... you name it, they've seen it,'' she said. ``We're notsure yet what it was.''   The Federal Aviation Administration, National Weather Service andmilitary bureaus and bases across the midwest and southwest wereswamped with calls from the curious, officials said.   ``It just appeared all of a sudden out of the south and fellstraight due north and it left a line just as straight as couldbe,'' Robin England of Abilene, Texas, told the AbileneReporter-News.   Ms. England said the rocket was in the sky for about threeminutes, slowly streaking across the sky.   Sgt. Ron Lenzini of the Macon, Mo., division of the MissouriState Highway Patrol, said the display was spectacular.   ``I went to the front door about 8:10 p.m. and saw what lookedlike a cluster of five pieces of some kind of burning debris in thesky,'' Lenzini said.   ``It had the effect of Fourth of July, or Roman candles trailingfire behind it,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
