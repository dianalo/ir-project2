The company said it had established adequate reserves in the past to cover the payments and that the settlement won't affect earnings. It said it expects to have fiscal 1987 net income of $2.10 to $2.25 a share. In its year ended Sept. 30, Comdisco had net of $78.8 million, or $1.91 a share, on revenue of $901.9 million.    The computer sales and leasing concern said that under the tax agreement it will recover the amount paid, plus interest, over three years because of certain tax carry-backs.    As previously reported, in a separate case settled last April, Comdisco paid $6.1 million related to a dispute with the IRS over the company's practice of discounting lease receivables from 1980 through 1982.    Comdisco said the expected record fiscal 1987 net would result from increased remarketing profit, the continued growth of its Comdisco Disaster Recovery Services unit and recent International Business Machines Corp. announcements about new products, which create new leasing and reselling opportunities.    The company also said it expected significantly improved results from its Comdisco Equities unit. In January, the company said that unit had a $22 million loss as a result of market fluctuations that occurred after the Securities and Exchange Commission announced wide-ranging insider trading investigations, which didn't involve Comdisco, late last year.    In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Comdisco shares closed at $27, up 50 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
