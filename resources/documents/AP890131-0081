The Consumer Federation of America and other consumer advocatesare also urging President Bush to reverse the administration'srefusal to let Texas and other states export hormone-free beef whileEurope and the United States spar over the safety of growth hormones.   The consumer advocates want Bush to negotiate a 90-daycooling-off period with the European Economic Community to keep thedispute from escalating into a trade war.   ``If the European Community and the United States proceed in thedirection that they're going we very well could have a real tradewar in which consumers on both sides of the Atlantic are reallygoing to be the ones who get hurt,'' Rod Leonard, executive directorof the Community Nutrition Institute, said Monday.   The EEC has said it will slap tough tariffs on American walnutsand dried fruit if no progress is made by Feb. 20 to end the disputeover hormones used by domestic producers to fatten cattle morequickly.   The EEC on Jan. 1 banned imports of beef treated with hormones,contending they are a health threat. The United States disputesthose claims and retaliated against the loss of about $100 millionin annual beef sales by setting $100 million in higher tariffs on avariety of Common Market goods.   Texas Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower has been workingwith the EEC to certify hormone-free beef from Texas and find buyersfor the Lone Star exports.   But the U.S. Trade Representative's office last week said such adeal would not be allowed because the U.S. Department of Agriculturehas no way to certify beef is hormone-free.   Leonard said he believes USDA ``can do a certification procedureif it wants to'' and questioned the administration's decision to barsuch exports as farmers, inching toward recovery after their worstrecession in decades, have an opportunity to find new markets.Leonard said a 90-day cooling off period would give Bush time todevelop a hormone-free beef certification procedure.   The Consumer Federation of American said the EEC's ban is ``anissue of consumer protection and not trade protection.''   ``Serious questions have been raised about the necessity andsafety of hormone additives in meat. Through the ban, consumers inEurope have expressed their preference for hormone-free beef. Theyhave opted to be safe, rather than sorry, and we believe thatpreference must be respected,'' said Sandra Eskin of the CFA, whichrepresents more than 240 state, local and national organizations.   She said U.S. consumers should push their preference forhormone-free beef and urge the USDA to develop a procedure thatcertifies beef has not been treated with hormones and other drugs orchemicals.   Rich Parker, a spokesman for the American Meat Institute, saidprices would increase if producers stopped using growth hormones.The AMI contends the hormone issue is a trade barrier that has``nothing to do with safety,'' Parker said. ``Europe wants to be anet exporter, not a net importer.''</TEXT></DOC>
