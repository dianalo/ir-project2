The candidates are a personable vice president with years ofinner-circle experience and a passionate champion of underdogsprone to taking ``reasonable risks.'' Come July, one of them willbe president of the 1.9-million-member union, the nation's largest.   With hats, buttons, banners and floor demonstrations, the sceneat the Washington Convention Center July 2-5 promises in many waysto resemble last summer's political conventions.   But there will be at least a couple of major differences. At8,000 delegates, the NEA convention will be bigger than theDemocratic and GOP parleys combined. And instead of serving as aforum to anoint a pre-selected candidate, this gathering will bemarked by ferocious last-minute campaigning and delegate-hunting bythe two men who hope to succeed Mary Futrell.   Observers agree Futrell, highly popular with teachers and soughtafter by the media, will be a tough act to follow. During herunprecedented six-year tenure, she has raised both the union'sprofile and its credibility on education issues.   Futrell also helped the NEA weather withering attacks by formerEducation Secretary William Bennett and shed its obstructionistimage during a period of increasing dissatisfaction with publicschools and calls for changes in teaching, curriculum and schoolmanagement.   Teachers who don't want to rock the boat are lining up for KeithGeiger, a conscientious team player during his last six years asNEA vice president. Those seeking a more impassioned leadershipstyle are leaning toward John Wilson, an executive committee memberand special education teacher from Raleigh, N.C.   Geiger points with pride to his negotiating ability andpolitical activism, honed in long years of collective bargainingand Democratic politics in Michigan. Wilson touts his currentstatus as a part-time classroom teacher and an ``action-orientedleadership style'' he says is lacking in Geiger.   ``We're both establishment candidates, but one of us is anactivist. The question is, do you want an active or a passivepresident,'' asserts Wilson.   Wilson's campaign slogan, ``a better leader for tomorrow becausehe teaches today,'' cuts to the heart of his argument that Geigeris too much the bureaucrat, too long gone from the classroom.   ``That's a phony issue. Mary Futrell has been out of theclassroom for nine years and I don't think anybody is saying she'snot a good president,'' Geiger shoots back. He depicts Wilson as ahardliner who would lead the NEA back into its obstructionist past.   ``The difference is whether we're going to hold onto ourlongstanding, old-time traditional unionist hat _ that we have tooppose everything that comes down the line unless we promote it, orwe're going to work for the kinds of education reform that willhelp move the organization along,'' Geiger said   Ed Foglia, a Wilson partisan and president of the CaliforniaEducation Association, called Wilson ``a reasonable risk-taker.Keith is a very personable individual, but he is not about to takeon the hard fight that John Wilson would. He is much more of acompromiser.''   Geiger and his supporters see that as an advantage. ``It's veryeasy to get on the stump when you haven't had the opportunity towork with power brokers and a whole set of people with vastlydifferent ideas. You have to be a negotiator,'' said Kathy Bell,president of the NEA affiliate in Florida.   Nowhere are the candidates' differences more apparent than theway their campaign literature treats the controversial,top-priority issue of teacher pay.   Wilson says the union should ``expose the misuse of evaluationsystems for teacher pay'' and ``stand firm in our opposition tomerit pay and career ladder programs.'' Geiger says the NEA shouldwork for dramatic pay raises in a few key states that would serveas models for other states, and try to get more federal money foreducation. Though he opposes merit pay, it is never mentioned inhis statement.   To Geiger, Wilson's adamance recalls the union's inflexiblepast. To Wilson, Geiger's avoidance of issues smacks of selling outto public opinion. ``I don't really believe in a go-along toget-along attitude,'' Wilson says. ``I will not compromise theneeds of our members for a good editorial.''</TEXT></DOC>
