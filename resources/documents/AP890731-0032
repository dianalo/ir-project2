It was a piece of cake,'' saidCapt. Edward J. Silva Jr., the senior harbor pilot who brought theValdez in Sunday.   Tugboats nudged the ship to a pier at the National Steel andShipbuilding Co. for a nine-month, $25 million repair job, ending a2,500-mile trek from Prince William Sound.   The docking closed a chapter in a grim environmental saga thatbegan when the 970-foot ship rammed Bligh Reef in Alaska's PrinceWilliam Sound on March 24.   The hull tore open and about 11 million gallons of crude gushedinto the sound. Thousands of animals were killed and miles ofcoastline were stained. The cleanup continues.   When an 18-mile oil slick coincided with the Valdez's arrivaloff California on July 10, the Coast Guard barred the ship from theharbor.   Tests from slick samples revealed degraded North Slope Alaskancrude and concentrations of marine organisms that inhabited theshredded cargo tanks.   Coast Guard Lt. Larry Solberg said no further discharges werespotted Sunday.   Exxon Shipping Co. President Frank Iarossi continued to deny theValdez was responsible for the earlier slick and at least twoothers off the coast, as charged by state Department of Fish andGame officials.   ``There was no oil on that ship. People are losing sight of thatfact,'' he said.   Reed Smith, a Fish and Game department response coordinator,said he was not impressed with the denial.   ``How do you discuss with him how to prevent more oil spillswhen he's not admitting he had one at all?'' Smith said.   Hundreds of people watched from shore as the Valdez entered thebay and rounded North Island, sailing past waterfront hotels andNavy warships.   Coast Guard and Harbor Patrol boats guarded a security zonearound the tanker. Ships with pollution containment and salvageequipment followed.   Greenpeace boats shadowed the vessel. Activist Kelly Quirke saidGreenpeace was protesting ``a fossil-fuel energy policy that is notonly destroying the ocean but the atmosphere.''   The Valdez will be moved to dry dock after an underwater surveyof damage. Iarossi said 30 percent of the hull is either gone orcannot rest on the blocks that usually hold up a vessel in dry dock.   Iarossi also disclosed that Exxon may try to remove the stigmafrom the ship by changing its name.   ``Rechristening wouldn't be in order, but we are consideringwhether we should start a new career for the vessel with a newname,'' he said.   The repair job stirred excitement at the shipyard, which expectsto add 300 people and boost its work force to 3,000.   Ship's Capt. Tom Hill said that getting the crippled vessel intoport was accomplishment enough.   ``We did everything humanly possible to save this ship withoutimpacting the environment,'' he said.   Under an agreement with state agencies, the Valdez had to beleak-free for 24 hours prior to entry and accompanied by apollution response vessel.   Exxon put $20 million in a bond and a trust account to covercleanup costs in the event of a spill in local waters.</TEXT></DOC>
