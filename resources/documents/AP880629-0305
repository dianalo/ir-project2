(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   For the past 25 years, James Gray haslabored in one of this city's tanneries, where workers slingrubbery white sheepskins over wooden stands and then treat, cut andcolor the skins with the touch of master craftsmen.   He never worried that his job could one day make him sick.   Now he does, since a state study showed tannery workers have anincreased risk of getting testicular cancer.   The study released by the New York state Department of Healthhas found that more than half of Fulton County's testicular cancervictims between 1974 and 1986 had worked in tanneries.   ``It's not a chance finding,'' said Dr. James Melius, directorof the Division of Occupational Health and EnvironmentalEpidemiology. ``People in the leather industry have an increasedrisk of getting testicular cancer.''   State officials suspect the chemical solvent dimethlyformamide,or DMF, is a possible cause of the cancer. The connection has yetto be proven, but while tests continue, the tanning companies havestopped using DMF to help dyes seep into leather.   The health scare comes at a time when the tanning industry herehas already fallen on hard times. Cheaper imports have shut downhundreds of operations, forcing the layoffs of thousands of workersand cutting the wages of those who have managed to hang on to theirjobs.   Despite the downturn, New York remains the nation's leadingtanning and glovemaking state _ ahead of Wisconsin, Maine,Massachusetts and Pennsylvania _ and more than two-thirds of theindustry's work force is in Fulton County.   The leather industry in the United States traces its roots backto 1853, when members of the Glovers' Guild of Perth, Scotland,founded the industry that gave Gloversville its name.   By 1892 there were 140 glove manufacturers and 52 tanneries inFulton County. During a boom period in the 1940s, the citiesproduced an estimated 95 percent of all leather gloves worn inAmerica. More than 5,000 workers, 20 percent of the county'spopulation, had jobs in one of the cities' 75 tanneries.   Today, approximately 13,000 people are still employed intanneries across the country, according to the U.S. Department ofLabor. In New York, the industry has shrunk to under 500 workersand only 17 tanneries still operate in Fulton County. Most firmshave moved to the Far East to take advantage of low wages for thehighly labor-intensive process.   Fulton County's unemployment rate, at 9.2 percent, is more thandouble the state average, making it one of the most economicallydepressed areas in New York. The toll can be seen on Gloversville'sMain Street, where blocks of empty stores, many with brokenwindows, line the city's main thoroughfare.   The situation leaves area workers torn between the need for jobsand concern about their health. People need a job, even one thatcould give them cancer, said William Towne, manager of the GloveCities Area Joint Board of the Amalgamated Clothing and TextileWorkers Union.   ``There's nowhere else for them to go,'' he said. ``For a longtime, fear of losing a job has been greater than fear of cancer.''   Richard Handy, who spent 13 years working at Gloversville's PanAmerican Tanning Corp., including shifts on a spray line where thesuspected cancer-causing DMF was used, agreed.   ``There's high unemployment there and we don't have any placeelse to get a job,'' he said during a recent legislative hearing inthe state capital on hazardous working environments. ``We have tohave a job to provide for our families.''   Handy doesn't have testicular cancer, but he has developedcancer of the larynx. He blames chemicals used in the tanneries forhis illness.   Both Handy and Towne say workers do want safer workingconditions. But at the same time they believe workers feel that ifthey place too much pressure on their employers, tannery ownerswill pack up and leave, taking much-needed jobs with them.   At this point, state health officials emphasize that DMF is onlya suspected cause of the cancer. However, they say they're highlysuspicious of the chemical because out of the seven tannery workerswho have contracted the disease since 1974, five worked at the PanAmerican spray line where DMF was used. A total of 10 Fulton Countymen have contracted testicular cancer since 1974.   ``We're suspicious there's a link between testicular cancer andDMF, but it hasn't been definitely proven yet,'' Melius said.``Tannery workers are exposed to so many toxic chemicals.''   An attorney for the local Tanners Association also notes thelack of conclusive evidence.   ``We understand that from all the data given to us that there'sno conclusion,'' attorney Frederick R. Stortecky said.   But tannery owners say they no longer use the chemical.   ``I think the industry has been responsive to new environmentalconcerns,'' said Tom Nickerson, president of the Wood and HydeLeather Corp. ``They responded as new information became known.''   Melius said health officials have told workers that even thoughDMF might not be used in tanneries anymore, men who had beenexposed to the chemical may be at risk of contracting the diseasefor up to 40 years.   Testicular cancer usually strikes men in their 20s and 30s, butolder men can also get the disease, Melius said. If treated early,the cancer is curable, he said.   Use of DMF is not limited to just the tanning industry. Thechemical, which is manufactured by Du Pont Co., is used widely inthe aircraft industry as well. Du Pont officials say a recent studyconducted by their company shows no evidence linking DMF withtesticular cancer.   The study included 8,700 employees who worked over a 30-yearperiod at one of the company's four plants that either manufacturesor uses the chemical, said Kathy Forte, a company spokeswoman,adding that Du Pont does require that all employees be vigorouslyprotected against exposure to chemicals on the job.   The results of Du Pont's two-year study were released in May andare now being reviewed by the National Institute of OccupationalSafety and Hazard.   The institute is also conducting a study of its own,specifically to find out if DMF actually causes testicular cancer.The results of the study should be released by the end of the year.   Meanwhile, people like Towne are trying to make the best of theindustry's plight.   ``It's depressing at times,'' the union manager said as he gazedout onto Main Street from his office. ``But for the leatherindustry, we've seen our attrition. What's here will be here for awhile.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions July 2-3</NOTE></DOC>
