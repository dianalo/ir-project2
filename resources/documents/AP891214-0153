The volcano, which last erupted 23 years ago, is 115 milessouthwest of Anchorage.   ``We had confirmation from a MarkAir pilot who sighted an ashplume at 35,000 feet,'' said John Davies, state seismologist. ``Asfar as I know, no health advisories have been issued yet. We'llwait and see how much ash gets into the air.''   An Air Force pilot flying a jet fighter west of Anchorage whenthe eruption occurred shortly after 10 a.m. said ash rose from15,000 feet to about 40,000 feet within 10 minutes.   ``We went right over that mountain on our way out to the(training) area and there was nothing happening,'' said Capt. SteveStoddard, an F-15 pilot. He said he flew back over the area within30 minutes and saw the ash cloud.   ``As we were heading back, I could see we'd have to fly throughit, so we turned down south and flew around the south side of it,''Stoddard said.   Oscar Nelson, a bread-truck driver who was on a highway acrossthe inlet from the volcano when it erupted, said the ash was ``realwhite and fluffy, almost like a cumulus cloud.''   ``We didn't hear any sound,'' said Nelson. ``We just noticed aplume starting to rise and thought we should jump out and get somepictures.''   Seven of 11 workers at the Drift River oil storage facility, thenearest habitation some 20 miles from the volcano, were evacuatedas a precaution because of the danger of flooding, said HaroldMouser, the manager of Cook Inlet Pipeline Co., operator of thefacility.   ``Our people have seen nothing, they felt nothing,'' he said.   He said some of the workers were evacuated in a light plane thathad gone to the site for a routine grocery delivery, and the otherswere transported in a plane sent because of the eruption. The oilfacility was closed. Mouser said a helicopter was standing by forpossible evacuation of the four employees who remained at the siteas monitors.   The U.S. Geological Survey had warned pilots Wednesday thatthere might be an ``ash hazard'' from the 10,197-foot volcano.Gritty volcanic ash is abrasive and can damage aircraft engines.   Davies said seismologists from several state and federalagencies had been monitoring activity beneath Redoubt Volcano fornearly a week, and activity increased about midday Wednesday.   ``We were here all night long,'' he said from his office at theUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks. ``At 10:13 this morning, there wasan obvious and very dramatic increase in activity. It indicatedmagma moving at depth, then increased activity at the summit.''   Concerns associated with the eruption include potential flashflooding of the Drift River from melted snow, the agency said. Suchflooding occurred the last time the volcano erupted, in 1966.   The Alaska Division of Emergency Services said a light dustingof ash was observed in the Wasilla area, about 40 miles northeastof Anchorage, shortly after noon Thursday.   ``You can feel the grit,'' said Jim Sey, operations and planningchief for the division.   ``I don't think there's too much to be concerned about on thisparticular eruption at this time,'' Sey said. Rather, he said,concerns involved the possibility of successive eruptions.   ``It's just sort of a wait-and-see game,'' Sey said.   There were no immediate reports of ash in Anchorage.   Redoubt Volcano is within the Lake Clark National Park andPreserve and has been active at least four times during thiscentury. Until the last few years, the volcano had an active steamvent near its summit.   An apparent steam flume from the flank of the volcano wasvisible from Anchorage during clear weather Friday, the USGS said.</TEXT></DOC>
