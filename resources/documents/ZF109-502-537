(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>AandM;Presentation graphics on the PC will never be the same again.andP;  PowerPoint, apresentation graphics package from Microsoft, has quite simply raisedeveryone's expectations.andM;Microsoft's introduction of Windows 3.0 will have enormous implications forall manner of applications, but most of all for graphical ones.andP;  To see whatthis entails, you need look no further than Power-Point, Microsoft's newentry in the presentation graphics field.andP;  This $495 program, an enhancedversion of the Macintosh product by the same name, is the first in the fieldto really make use of what the Windows 3.0 environment offers: a consistentgraphical user interface, transparent access to all the memory in your PC,and device-independent access to PostScript printers and high-resolutiongraphics adapters.andM;The benefits of the Windows interface are very real.andP;  Unlike its most popularDOS-based competitors, PowerPoint lets you manipulate words and pictures intrue WYSIWYG mode.andP;  Instead of working with multiple menu options andtext-entry boxes, you can simply type, draw, and paste objects right on yourslides or overheads.andP;  The results are immediately apparent; PowerPoint'sdesign makes it a good deal easier to use for creating great presentations.andM;WORDS, WORDS, WORDSandM;PowerPoint's design philosophy of easy, direct manipulation is apparent fromslide one.andP;  Most slides that people create are word charts, and the defaultslide that comes up when you first open PowerPoint proves just how easy wordcharts can be.andP;  To begin work all you really have to do is select the titlebox (by clicking on it) and begin typing.andM;PowerPoint's toolbox provides a number of methods for entering text directlyinto a slide.andP;  Large text blocks, especially if they contain multipleindents, demand the power of the word processing tool, which creates a textframe where you can type text in a predefined format.andP;  The tab ruler providesa wonderfully interactive method for setting indents and margins.andP;  If you arefamiliar with Word for Windows, you will have no trouble working with thefive possible tab stops, or with the visual method used to create hangingindents.andM;For free-floating text, PowerPoint offers a label tool that is invaluable foradding notes to clip-art images and graphs.andP;  PowerPoint's ellipse, rectangle,and rounded rectangle tools provide a third way of entering text.andP;  Just clickon a geometric shape and you get a text-insertion cursor.andP;  The completed textis actually part of the graphic, so the two elements can't be inadvertentlyseparated if you decide to modify the design in any way.andP;  You can still editthe text, however, and the spell checker will work on it just like on anyother piece of copy.andM;FONT HEAVEN?andM;No matter what type of text entry you prefer, you'll find that PowerPointmakes it easy for you to choose an appropriate typeface and style, usingself-explanatory menus.andP;  You can even define your own type styles, whichinclude information on the typeface, point size, color, and attributes (suchas boldface or italic) for any text.andP;  This feature lets you apply a range oftype options to a text block in one fell swoop, a real convenience.andP;  ButPowerPoint's type styles lack the true power of style sheets in the sense ofVentura Publisher or Microsoft Word because you cannot accomplish globalchanges simply by editing the styles menu.andM;If you install PowerPoint for a PostScript printer, you'll automatically haveaccess to the printer's resident Adobe typefaces.andP;  PowerPoint alsoaccommodates LaserJet users by bundling Dutch, Swiss, and Zapf Dingbatsscalable fonts from Bitstream with the program.andP;  But be warned; the separatebitmaps for printer and screen fonts eat up an enormous amount of disk space.andO;LaserJet users should expect to devote 16MB of their hard disk just for theprogram and font files alone.andM;Needless to say, PowerPoint would benefit dramatically from the addition of atype manager that can generate screen fonts on the fly.andP;  Until thatcapability is built into the operating environment (Microsoft is expected tointegrate its TrueType scalable font technology into Windows eventually), youmay want to consider such third-party products as Adobe Type Manager (to bereleased by the time you read this) or Atech Software's Publisher's PowerPak.andM;PowerPoint rounds out its text-handling tools with a search-and-replacefunction and a spell checker that can maintain a custom dictionary inaddition to the default dictionary.andP;  The spell checker uses Word for Windowsdictionaries, so you can share dictionaries with that program if you happento have it.andP;  You cannot spell-check the text contained within pictures orgraphs, however.andM;ASSIGNED ATTRIBUTESandM;PowerPoint is not a drawing program.andP;  You can move, resize, and delete thelines, ellipses, rectangles, and rounded rectangles that you create withinthe program.andP;  But PowerPoint has no freehand drawing capabilities, containsno functions for combining objects, and does not allow you to rotate, skew,or automatically align images.andP;  These limitations are deliberate.andP;  Instead ofproviding drawing tools geared for artists, Power-Point supplies formattingoptions geared for the average business user.andP;  Accordingly, you can assignattributes such as color, fill pattern, drop shadow, and line style toobjects with just one or two menu clicks.andM;Still, there's a lot of power hidden in the tool set.andP;  For example,.andP;  you candouble-click on a corner of the marquee box that surrounds a selected objectto return to the image's original aspect ratio.andP;  And the vertical andhorizontal guides have a built-in snap-to function to help you accuratelyposition objects.andP;  Moving the guides while holding down the Control keyresets the zero point to the guide's new location-in effect turning it into ameasuring tool.andP;  And if you want to group a collection of objectspermanently, you simply group-select them.. copy them to the clipboard, andthen paste them back into PowerPoint using the Paste as Picture function.andM;If you want to include complex images in your presentation, you can turn tothe 400 clip-art images (designed by Genigraphics) that come with PowerPoint.andO;Alternatively, you can employ PowerPoint's robust import filters to bringartwork in from other sources.andP;  The Windows Metafile (.WMF) format is thepreferred format since it's fully supported via the Windows clipboard.andP;  Butyou can use the Paste From function to pull in vector images in HPGL,AutoCAD.DXF, .EPS, and CGM formats, or bitmapped images in .PCX, MicrosoftPaint (.MSP), black-and-white TIFF, Windown Bitmap  (.BMP), orDevice-Independent Bitmap (.DIB) formats.andM;Though PowerPoint's tools let you resize, crop, and change the colors of clipart, you cannot break a Metafile image down into its constituent elements inorder to edit outlines or to individually color objects.andP;  This is a seriouslimitation because it forces you to use another graphics program if you wantto customize PowerPoint's clip art to your needs.andM;ACCEPTABLE CHARTINGandM;Unlike its Macintosh predecessor, PowerPoint on the PC comes with a chartingmodule; you don't have to create your graphs elsewhere before bringing theminto your presentations.andP;  A separate executable file, the Graph module islaunched from within PowerPoint, using DDE as an internal transfer mechanismPowerPoint does not support user-defined DDE hot links).andM;The charting module is a pleasure to work with; just choose the Insert Graphcommand from the File menu and two windows pop up on screen, so you can seeboth the data sheet and its graph at once.andP;  PowerPoi;zt's data sheet is 127rows by 127 columns, offering an astoundingly large 16,129 data points.andP;  Youcan enter your data directly, or you can import it from 1-2-3, Symphony,Excel, or SYLK worksheet files, either in their entirety or as named ranges,including formula results.andP;  You can even choose to graph non-contiguousnumbers; simply double-click on a column or row header to remove it from thedata series.andM;But you'll find a real tradeoff between ease of use and formattingflexibility.andP;  For example, to choose among the various styles of area, bar,column, line, pie, or scatter charts, you merely click one of the thumbnails.andO;But you're given only eight color choices, and these have nothing to do withthe PowerPoint color scheme for the entire presentation.andP;  In fact, they arethe eight EGA colors-remember light brown?andM;Similarly, though you can modify the position and size of the legend, you cando so only if you opt to place it within the chart.andP;  If you put it in anyother position (at the bottom or to the right, for example), it becomes afixed object that cannot be moved.andP;  And you can't determine the position ofdata labels at all.andM;Even worse, when you accept the graph and return to PowerPoint, you willdiscover that the chart has been pasted in as a linked picture.andP;  The onlymodifications you can make are those allowed for any importedpicture-resizing, cropping, repositioning, or recoloring.andP;  This can be aconsiderable inconvenience; in order to move the legend in one of the graphs,for instance, I was forced to copy the entire graph to the clipboard, pastethe copy in as a picture, and then use the cropping tool to isolate thelegend.andP;  To make more-extensive changes, you must go back to the embeddeddata sheet and regenerate the chart (you do this by double-clicking on thepicture).andP;  Both Harvard Graphics and Lotus Freelance Plus are vastly superioron this score; they let you ungroup the elements in a graph or drawing andreformat them individually.andM;POWERFUL OVERVIEWSandM;Though PowerPoint's text, drawing, and charting features help you to producegreat-looking individual transparencies, the program's real power resides inits ability to create and manage your presentations.andM;Unlike Lotus Freelance Plus and Harvard Graphics, which create one slide perfile, a single PowerPoint file contains an entire presentation, includingslides, speaker's notes, and handout summaries.andP;  Never again will you have togo through the extra step of collecting all of your individual slide imagesinto a show list.andP;  PowerPoint's single-file system lets your slides, speakernotes, and handouts share images-saving disk space and providing automaticupdates to all aspects of your presentation whenever you edit a slide.andM;Some of PowerPoint's best features are aimed at helping you to buildattractive presentations quickly.andP;  For instance, you can assign a &quot;masterslide&quot; (or master note page, or master handout) to any presentation.andP;  Muchlike PageMaket-'s master pages, master slides help you create a consistentlook for your presentation by repeating graphic elements such as a companylogo, customized rules, or standard text boxes on every slide.andP;  If the masterisn't appropriate to a given slide, you can omit it.andP;  You can create aninstant template by opening any presentation as an untitled copy, and settingdefault text and drawing styles is almost effortless.andM;Creating the basic outline of your presentation is equally fast.andP;  ThoughPowerPoint does not have a built-in outliner, it does accept outlines fromWordfor Windows directly, allowing you to create the text slides of an entirepresentation-properly formatted-in a single operation.andP;  You can also importoutlines in suitably formatted ASCII files (see Power Tip 3, &quot;From Outline toSlide Show&quot;).andM;Once you've created your presentation, you can get a good look at the wholething by switching into one of PowerPoint's two overview modes.andP;  The SlideSorter shows detailed thumbnail versions of each image, while the TitleSorter lists all of their headlines and is a bit faster to redraw.andP;  In eithercase, it's a snap to reorder the sequence of your slides-simply click anddrag a title or a miniature to a new location.andP;  It's also easy to borrowslides from other presentations; because you can open multiple presentationssimultaneously, copying slides between presentations is a simple clipboardoperation rather than an elaborate procedure.andM;EASY HARD COPYandM;Although most of your presentations will probably consist of black-and-whiteoverhead transparencies produced on laser printers, the temptation to usecolor slides may just be too hard to resist once you see how easy they are tocreate are to create with PowerPoint.andP;  Color selection is normally one of thetrickiest parts of creating a slide presentation, but Microsoft, inpartnership with Genigraphics, a nationally based slide service bureau, makesthe process foolproof.andM;PowerPoint presentations are based on a simple color scheme of eight hues.andO;Change any of the eight colors in the color scheme, and you can apply thechanges to every one of the slides-in effect remapping the colors of theobjects throughout the entire presentation.andP;  You needn't feel constrained bythe eight standard colors, however.andP;  You can add eight more color choices,which you can apply to objects on a case-by-case basis.andP;  This helps to ensurethat your colors are consistent throughout the presentation.andM;If the thought of choosing colors that match strikes fear into your heart,relax.andP;  Genigraphics has worked out a palette creation system for PowerPointthat even colorblind presenters can love.andP;  The color selection dialog boxbegins by presenting only background colors.andP;  Once you've picked one, you geta selection of several foreground colors that are guaranteed to be legible onthat background.andP;  Choosing a foreground color then brings up a series ofcoordinated accent colors.andP;  One more mouse click completes your basicpalette.andM;The Genigraphics palette recommendations are quite varied, and you may neverneed to wander outside of them.andP;  But if you do, PowerPoint does give you twomore flexible methods of choosing and creating colors.andP;  Opting for extrahues, or changing one of the items in the color scheme brings you to asecondary dialog box that contains a matrix of 90 colors specifically chosento provide a close match between your VGA screen and the Genigraphics filmrecorder.andP;  Our test presentation proved that you can trust these selections.andO;If you have a real need for custom colors, another function lets you mix yourown (using the hue/saturation/ luminance model) from the total palette of 16million.andM;Under Windows 3.0's standard 16-color VGA driver, most of the colors appearin a dithered form, requiring trial and error to match screen colors tooutput colors.andP;  But if you own an extended VGA card (such as Video Seven'sV-RAM VGA adapter) that has a 256-color Windows 3.0 driver, you can displayall of the 256 simultaneous colors that PowerPoint supports on a singleslide.andP;  Though slower to update, this gives eye-catching results, showingclear distinctions between different shades of the same color and lendingsmooth transitions to gradient fills in your slide backgrounds or clip art.andO;If you do a lot of work with color slides, a 256-color video card is amust-have.andM;SHOW TIMEandM;PowerPoint tries to make the difficult task of generating high-quality outputas painless as possible.andP;  To help you create your slides, Genigraphicssupplies a special printer driver plus the Graphics Link, a proprietarycommunications program that lets you send the company your slides.andO;Genigraphics provides Economy, Standard, or Rush turnaround, and prices forslides and overhead transparencies range from $9.95 to $19.50 per image,depending on how quickly you need to have the slides processed.andP;  If youalready have a working relationship with another slide service bureau, you'llhave to decide if the tradeoff is worth it-at the moment, Genigraphics is theonly direct-to-slide vendor that PowerPoint supports.andM;Our experience with Genigraphics was quite satisfactory.andP;  With the exceptionof one glitch, traceable to the fact that the Windows Metafile format doesnot support irregularly shaped gradient fills, the slides were perfect.andP;  TheGenigraphics printer driver is smart enough to generate a list of exceptionswhen you print a slide file to disk.andP;  This report will alert you if you usefonts in your presentation that are not supported by the Genigraphics filmrecorder, and also if you attempt to use the area outside of the acceptableprinting range.andP;  It even specifies page numbers so that you can more easilygo back to the problem slide and make corrections.andM;Using the Graphics Link successfully requires only that you know youraddress, your deadline, and your credit card number.andP;  The program containsall of the necessary communication parameters-as well as Genigraphic'stollfree number; an electronic form prompts you for the handling and billinginformation.andP;  Right now, the program cannot communicate in the background,but Genigraphics is working on a new version that will and also let youinclude Encapsulated PostScript (.EPS) images in your slides.andM;Even color presentations require black-and-white output, if nothing else butto do speaker's notes and handouts.andP;  PowerPoint lets you install a separateoutput device for speaker's notes, so that you can print them on your laserprinter without changing the device you'll use for producing the slides.andP;  Asimple check in the printer dialog box lets you reverse the gray tones of theslide images.andP;  This has the effect of increasing legibility because itinverts the slide image from light text on a dark background to dark text ona light background.andP;  For even better legibility, you can simply apply ablack-and-white color scheme to your presentation.andM;The paltry screen-show facility is the one area in which PowerPoint has noexcuse for its shortcomings.andP;  You can use keyboard commands to navigatethrough a screen show out of sequence, but jumping around erratically willgive you very slow screen redraws because PowerPoint assumes aforward-progressing presentation and caches consecutive images in memory.andO;You cannot assign transition effects or script different display  times foreach slide.andP;  And since a screen show requires a full version of Windows andPowerPoint in addition to the presentation itself (the overhead ofduplicating the Windows environment precludes a runtime screen-show module),it's impossible to distribute a presentation on a floppy disk or otherconvenient medium.andM;A NEW AGEandM;PowerPoint's philosophy- embodied by master slides, templates, and fail-safecolor schemes-is a definite step up when it comes to managing slide andoverhead presentations.andP;  Its robust Wordfor Windows-like word processor givesyou great flexibility when designing individual slides.andP;  And creating simplegraphs in the Excel-like charting module is a breeze.andP;  The downside is thatthose features require a substantial hardware investment.andP;  A 386-based PCwith 4MB of RAM, a fast, high-resolution graphics adapter, and a whole lot offree disk space is a practical necessity.andM;As long as you can meet the minimum hardware requirements and are content tostay within the prescribed limits of the program, you can producegreat-looking overheads and slides.andP;  The fact that there are no surprisesbetween your VGA screen and final output is perhaps the program's strongestselling point.andM;However, venturing beyond those limits is difficult-sometimes impossible.andP;  Ifyou constantly update a text-based presentation by editing an outline, forinstance, you'll find that PowerPoint's work around import scheme justdoesn't compensate for the lack of a built-in outliner.andP;  And anyone who needsto present complex data sets will find the formatting options of the Graphmodule frustratingly limited.andP;  Finally, the Genigraphics slide service bureauis currently your only option for direct 35-mm.andP;  output.andM;In time, PowerPoint will gain some stiff competition from other presentationproducts running under Windows 3.0 and Presentation Manager, notably thelong-rumored PC version of Aldus' Persuasion.andP;  Whether these products aredirect Macintosh ports like Persusasion or new versions of your favoriteDOS-based graphics programs, they will have to offer some major improvements.andO;Because by the time they are released, we will all be addicted to the ease ofuse and high-quality output offered by PowerPoint.andP;  nandM;Luisa Simone is a contributing editor of PC Magazine.andM;TRICKS WITH GRADIENT FILLSandM;1.andP;  Open a new slide.andM;2.andP;  In the color scheme dialog box, create a gradient-filled background ofany color.andP;  Apply the new fill to the current slide only.andM;3.andP;  Draw an object using the graphics primitives (a rectangle, for example).andO;The rectangle should remain selected.andM;4.andP;  On the Draw menu, assign the Opaque attribute to the object.andP;  This willforce the object to pick up the background fill.andP;  Be sure to position theobject on the section of the gradation you wish to copy.andM;5.andP;  Copy the object to the clipboard.andP;  You now have a gradient-shaded objectthat can be moved anywhere.andM;6.andP;  Paste the object from the clipboard back into the slide of your choice byusing the special command Paste As Picture.andM;We have all come to associate the gradient-fill backgrounds on slides withthe high-quality 35-mm film recorders used by third-party service bureaus.andO;Most PC-based presentation programs are unable to show them on screen,however.andP;  But PowerPoint has a special menu option  just for creating shadedbackgrounds, and on-screen thumbnails to help you keep track of them.andP;  Youcan even create shaded objects and place them anywhere in your presentations;just use the Paste as Picture command on the Edit menu.andP;  Once you've masteredthis impressive little trick, you can achieve more-sophisticated effects byoverlapping individual objects with different gradient fills.andP;  And if youhave an extended VGA card with a 256-color driver, the transitions willappear smooth-you won't see the grainy dither patterns that are necessarywith the default 16-color driver.andP;  FINDING AND MANAGING CLIP ARTandM;1.andP;  Open a clip-art file; for example, the collection of animals.andM;2.andP;  Go to the Title Sorter view.andP;  Even though no text appears on the slides,each of the images is titled so that you can find the one you want fairlyeasily.andM;3.andP;  Save the file in Title Sorter view.andP;  Now each time you open the file itwill appear in fast text mode.andM;4.andP;  To find a particular piece of art, pull down the Text menu and open theFind/Change dialog box.andP;  (The Find command will also work in Slide Sorter andSlide views.)andM;5.andP;  Enter the text string to search for &quot;Elephant.&quot; PowerPoint will searchfor the title and automatically bring up the slide that contains that title.andO;You can follow a similar procedure to create your own indexed andpersonalized clip-art collection within PowerPoint.andM;1.andP;  Create a new presentation (call it CLIPPED.PPT).andM;2.andP;  Import as many images as you wish, with one picture per slide.andM;3.andP;  In the default title field, type in a simple description of the image.andO;You may wish to make the title invisible by assigning the same color to boththe text and the background.andM;4.andP;  Save the presentation in Title Sorter view.andM;If you are not an artist, you'll really appreciate the 400 clip-art imagesthat come bundled with PowerPoint incorporating an image into your slide showcouldn't be simpler because the Genigraphics clip-art libraries are stored asPowerPoint presentations.andP;  Just open up a Genigraphics clip art file, copy animage to the clipboard, and paste it into your slide.andM;Sifting through the clip-art library, however, can be a tedious procedure,primarily because you must wait for the screen to redraw before you can moveon to another image.andP;  To get around this, use PowerPoints text-based TitleSorter to dramatically spead up your search time.andP;  In addition, you can usethe Find menu  options as a &quot;go to&quot; command when dealing with clip art.andM;FROM OUTLINE TO SLIDE SHOWandM;1.andP;  Create an outline in your favorite word processor.andP;  You can use up tofive different levels of indentation  PowerPoint's maximum.andP;  Use hardcarriage returns to designate the end of each paragraph, not each line (thisis the only difficult part to master and may require some trial and error).andO;Insert the appropriate number of tab stops for the various indents withineach paragraph.andM;2.andP;  Save the outline as a pure ASCII text file.andM;3.andP;  Load PowerPoint and prepare a template for your presentation.andP;  The masterslide should include your logo, any rules, and specs for the title box, anddefault setting (such as typestyle and indents) for a secondary wordprocessing box.andM;4.andP;  Go to the Slide Sorter view and use the Paste From command on the Filemenu to bring in the ASCII file that contains the outline.andP;  PowerPoint willautomatically create a separate slide for each main-level heading and willindent the subsequent copy based on the number of tab stops in eachparagraph.andP;  You can create up to 50 slides with a single ASCII text file.andM;5.andP;  Go back to each slide and fine-tune the formatting.andM;When you have a single slide on screen, the Paste From command automaticallysearches for graphics files on the disk.andP;  But in either Title Sorter or SlideSorter view, this same command lets you paste text files (saved in eitherASCII or Rich Text Format) into your PowerPoint presentation.andP;  BecausePowerPoints text import filter looks for tabs, you can use it to partiallyovercome one of PowerPoints main shortcomings-its lack of a text outliner.andO;(You can also directly import Word for Windows outlines) Of course, if youchange the text of you outline later, you'll have to make the changesdirectly on the slides, or else reimport the entire outline.andP;  But this methodcan save a lot of time in starting yours presentation.andM;INSTANT COLORSandM;1.andP;  Open the presentation that contains the color scheme you wish to copy.andM;2.andP;  Open the Color Scheme dialog box, which will contain the palette of thecurrent presentation.andP;  Leave it open on the screen.andM;3.andP;  Now open the presentation to which you want to copy the color scheme.andM;4.andP;  Click on the All Slides option and then Apply the color scheme to the newpresentation.andM;5.andP;  Close the Color Scheme dialog box by double-clicking on the control menuicon in the upper-left-hand comer.andM;The graphical interface conventions of Windows 3.0-such as cascading menus,drop-down list boxes, and modeless dialog boxes-provide additional functionsto PowerPoints feature set.andP;  PowerPoints Color Scheme option, for example,appears in a modeless dialog box, which can be displayed continually whileyou work on one or more presentations.andP;  This makes it convenient to changecolors quickly and also makes R possible to easily copy a palette from onepresentation to another.andM;ArcList[R] -- your first punch-- lets you professionally manage you list  onyour IBM or compatible PC with 640K RAM and a hard disk.andP;
