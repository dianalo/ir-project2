Intravenous tubes hung overhead. A respirator led awayfrom his throat.;    But this time, he was conscious. The &quot;blood&quot; thatstreaked his face was fake. And the intravenous tubes weren't even connectedto his arm.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  VICTIM OF BICYCLE CRASH RELIVES TRAUMA FORTV'S 'RESCUE 911'  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Smith's return to the hospital was staged Sunday for the television show&quot;Rescue 911,&quot; which later this spring will feature a re-creation of his nearlyfatal January 1989 bicycle crash.;    As Smith, now 17, struggled to keep hiseyes closed, a three-man crew orchestrated the movements of three nurses andtechnicians, down to the position of their hands at computer keyboards.Throughout the day, the crew retraced Smith's monthlong stay at the hospital,from the emergency room to the intensive care unit, where he was in a coma foreight days.;    The hospital scenes are but one part of a weeklong taping forthe 15-minute segment. Saturday, producers re-created the accident, using astunt man to simulate Smith's flying off his bicycle at 50 miles an hour onsteep Sierra Road north of Alum Rock Park.;    Producers were drawn to Smith'sstory in part by the drama of his treatment: An unidentified bicyclist --Smith was treated as a &quot;John Doe&quot; while police searched for his parents --with severe head injuries who is not expected to live resumes his high-schoolathletic career.;    But they were really tugged by the family drama aroundhim: Smith's parents, divorced in 1982, reunited after the long months ofstanding vigil together by his side. They remarried in November.;    &quot;We likehappy endings, obviously,&quot; said field coordinator Bonnie Zane.;    JeanneSmith said she offered the family's story as a way to encourage otherbicyclists to wear helmets and carry identification. With Jason, however,she's shooting only 50 percent: He now carries an ID but still refuses to weara helmet.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  SCOTT THURM, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910211  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  323  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday February 11, 199100042178,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
