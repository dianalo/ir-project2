The report, financed by the U.S. Department of Energy, MIT andtwo electric companies, was to be released Thursday in the latestissue of the school magazine Technology Review.   The study looked at plants in Japan, Sweden, France, Switzerland,West Germany and the United States from 1975 to 1984. In the UnitedStates it examined the nearly 200 light water reactors producingmore than 300 megawatts.   The average plant in the United States produced energy less than60 percent of the time, while most of the other countries at the endof the period were at 75 percent, said MIT professor Kent Hansen,the project's chief author.   ``One of our conjectures is that all elements concerned withnuclear power have not been able to work together to solve nuclearproblems,'' Hansen said.   Golay said that when Japan decided to improve the available ofnuclear-generated power, ``they did it by making it a national goal.The U.S. has tried to do some of that, but so far, in terms ofavailability, it has failed.''   ``What is unique to the United States is a highly antagonisticrelationship between regulators and utilities,'' the report said.   ``In other countries, relationships between regulators andutilities become strained at times, but all parties report thatcommunication is open and forthright, with no group withholdinginformation or acting secretly or vindictively. ... Nor dopoliticians attempt to interfere in regulatory decisions.''   Golay said much of the hostility ``is the consequence ofoperating in a goldfish bowl. In other countries they operate behindclosed doors.''   Nuclear industry spokesman Scott Peters agreed with theassessment of 60 percent efficiency. But in a telephone interviewfrom the U.S. Council for Energy Awareness in Washington, he said,``We're getting better.''   As for cooperation among utilities, after the 1979 accident atThree Mile Island in Pennsylvania, utilities set up a computer linkto share information, and the industry also has established theInstitute of Nuclear Power Operators.   He noted that in France, where nuclear power facilities areconsidered outstanding, the government owns the utility.   ``That's a fairly simple relationship. Ours is more complex. TheNuclear Regulatory Commission is careful not to get too close to theindustry. There's an arm's length (relationship), as it should be,''he said.   But he added, ``I don't think it's contributing to inefficency.''</TEXT></DOC>
