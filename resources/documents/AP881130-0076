The novels are not beneficial to society, Vadim A. Medvedev saidat a news conference Tuesday.   ``What we have here is a struggle against our system as such. ...I am against the publication of a number of works by Solzhenitsyn,and in the first place such works as `Lenin in Zurich,' and the`Gulag Archipelago,''' he said.   ``To publish Solzhenitsyn's works would mean to, in effect,undermine the foundations on which today's life rests,'' Medvedevsaid.   Medvedev, the newest member of the ruling Politburo, is regardedas one of those closest to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   Under Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or greater openness, manyprohibited works have been published.   Some writers, artists and activists in informal political groupshave urged that Solzhenitsyn's works be published and that he beallowed to visit the Soviet Union.   The author was expelled from the Soviet Union in 1974 and livesin Cavendish, Vt.   Medvedev is considered a theoretician of many social and economicreform policies, but his statement made clear there still are limitson the amount of openness allowed under Gorbachev's reforms.   Solzhenitsyn's novel ``One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich''was published in 1962 during the thaw allowed by Nikita S.Khrushchev after the death of Stalin. But the remainder of his majorworks remain unpublished in his native land.   ``Gulag Archipelago,'' Solzhenitsyn's masterpiece, is a chronicleof Soviet political repression. ``Lenin in Zurich'' is part of acycle of books Solzhenitsyn still is completing about the 1917Bolshevik revolution, and traces the life of Vladimir I. Lenin inexile in the years just prior to the Soviet takeover.   Medvedev was chosen Kremlin ideology chief in a shake-up of topCommunist Party and government jobs by Gorbachev this year.   Medvedev said that in Solzhenitsyn's work, ``a position is beingdeveloped which radically contradicts our social and politicalsystem, our understanding of the world, of history, our attitudetoward Lenin.''</TEXT></DOC>
