She and six other missionaries had been captured in May by soldiers of Renamo, the rebel group fighting the Marxist government. After &quot;disciplined and gentlemanly&quot; Renamo soldiers escorted the group to neutral Malawi, Miss Bryan tried to return to the U.S. last Friday via Zimbabwe, which has 15,000 troops fighting Renamo inside Mozambique. She was promptly detained for questioning by Zimbabwean secret police, and only released after protests by U.S. diplomats. </TEXT></DOC>
