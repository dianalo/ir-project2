The latest amendment was filed on May 24, 1989. A notice in this matterwas previously issued on September 11, 1986 (HCAR No. 24189). QMT requests an order of the Commission (1) approving QMT's proposed acquisitionof all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Central Illinois PublicService Company (``CIPS''), an Illinois corporation, and the indirect acquisitionof 20% of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Electric Energy, Inc.(``EEI''), also an Illinois corporation, through CIPS' ownership of theseshares, and (2) granting QMT and its subsidiary companies, upon consummationof the proposed transaction, an exemption under section 3(a)(1) of theAct from all provisions of the Act except section 9(a)(2). QMT was incorporated by CIPS on July 11, 1986, for the purpose of acquiringall of CIPS' common stock. QMT proposes to acquire all of CIPS' commonstock by exchanging shares of its authorized common stock for all of thecurrently outstanding shares of CIPS common stock (``Stock Exchange'').QMT currently owns no utility assets and is not a holding company underthe Act. QMT states that the purpose of the reorganization is to providethe flexibility and capability to make investments in other business ventures.CIPS is a public-utility company and an exempt holding company by reasonof filing exemption statements pursuant to rule 2 under the Act. It isprincipally engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution, andsale of electricity in central and southern Illinois to approximately 306,000customers in 550 communities and adjacent suburban and rural areas. CIPSalso furnishes natural gas service to approximately 157,000 Illinois customersin 257 communities and adjacent suburban and rural areas. CIPS' total operatingrevenues for 1988 were $616,188,000, of which $499,486,000 (81%) was fromelectric service and $116,702,000 (18%) was from gas service. CIPS doesnot provide electric or gas service outside of Illinois. As of December31, 1988, CIPS had outstanding 34,171,873 shares of its common stock, nopar value. CIPS also had 920,000 shares of preferred stock, $100 par value,outstanding as of this date. CIPS owns 20% of the capital stock of EEI, which owns a 1,000 MW generatingstation at Joppa, Illinois. EEI was organized in 1950 by CIPS and severalother public-utility companies (``Sponsoring Companies'') primarily tosupply a substantial portion of the electric power requirements of a federalatomic energy installation (``Installation'') at Paducah, Kentucky, nowadministered by the Department of Energy (``DOE''). The Commission, takingnotice of the Installation's importance to national defense, approved CIPS'acquisition of the capital stock of EEI in <T3>Central Illinois Public Service Co.,</T3> 32 S.E.C. 202, 204 (1951),and<T3> Electric Energy, Inc., </T3>38 S.E.C. 658, 660 (1958). All of theelectricity sold by EEI is purchased by DOE and the Sponsoring Companies,and those sales are EEI's only sources of revenue. EEI does not sell electricityto private consumers and does not have any equity securities outstandingin the hands of the public. EEI had outstanding at December 31, 1988, $34,200,000in short-term and long-term notes under two revolving credit agreementswith banks. CIPS' investment of $2,042,561 in its 20% interest in EEI is 0.12% of CIPS'total assets as of December 31, 1988. During the 12-month period endingDecember 31, 1988, CIPS received $2,248,619 as its share of EEI's net income,which amounted to 2.6% of CIPS' net income for that period. QMT and CIPS intend that, as a result of the Stock Exchange, QMT will ownall the outstanding common stock of CIPS. CIPS will continue to own 20%of the capital stock of EEI. Holders of CIPS preferred stock and firstmortgage bonds will continue as security holders of CIPS. CIPS intendsto submit the Stock Exchange to its share holders for their approval. The proposed Stock Exchange was approved by an initial order of the IllinoisCommerce Commission (``ICC''), dated October 7, 1987; however, considerationof other issues, including the issue of ``compensatory payments'' to CIPSfrom nonutility affiliates, resulted in a reopening of the case. The ICCissued its final order, which approved the transaction, on April 26, 1989.QMT filed its latest amendment on May 24, 1989, following receipt of theICC's final order.
