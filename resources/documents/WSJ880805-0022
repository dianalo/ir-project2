But major movie and television studios think they got something for their money: a greater ability to face down other unions.    The executives believe their hand was strengthened by their dogged unity in the face of one of Hollywood's longest strikes, and although studio executives won't say so until the writers ratify the new contract, they are convinced they won.    &quot;In the last 20 to 30 years in Hollywood there has been an inability of management to coalesce, which is why this industry has had a greater escalation of costs than any other industry in America,&quot; said one studio chief. &quot;Now we really understand it can't go on.&quot;    Indeed, almost as soon as the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers completed talks with the writers, who will vote on the proposed contract Sunday, negotiations resumed with Teamsters Local 399 and other unions representing plumbers, electricians and other workers. Their contract expired last Sunday.    Another studio head said that &quot;negotiations with the Teamsters and the IA {International Alliance of Theatrical and Stage Employees} are far more important&quot; than the writers' talks, because far more money is involved.    Including IATSE, the largest of the lot, the crafts unions have about 30,000 members. IATSE has extended its current pact to Jan. 31 and proclaimed itself amenable to work-rule changes. For example, IATSE agreed to have the upholsterers and sewers merged into a single category, a spokesman said, and is entertaining other such changes.    Producers and union leaders also say management's demonstrated willingness to take a long strike -- and the amount of income already lost -- make it less likely that another union will walk out.    The Writers Guild of America strike brought writers higher basic payments and more creative control over their work, but the Guild was forced to grant the producers' main demand: a sliding payment schedule for one-hour reruns in syndication, which even the union admits will have the effect of cutting residual payments.    &quot;That the producers held on will stand them well for the future,&quot; said Barry Diller, chairman of Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp.    Now the Alliance will turn its attention to the producers' longstanding desire to roll back costly union work rules and egregious featherbedding. For example, Hollywood film sets typically feature lights, cameras and poker-playing Teamsters, whose contract says they can't drive anything all day except the truck they brought to the site in the morning.    Financially, smaller companies and individuals suffered the most from the strike. Thousands of individuals were on picket lines or found themselves laid off, and smaller companies specializing in TV production were unable to do business unless they signed an interim agreement with the Writers Guild.    On the other hand, earnings at entertainment giants like Warner Communications Inc. and Walt Disney Co. probably won't suffer much because these companies are too diversified. But some big concerns, such as Lorimar Telepictures Inc., are heavily dependent on television, and might feel a greater impact.    Mara Balsbaugh, an entertainment analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham, noted that so many programs are made at a short-term loss -- in hopes of profits from re-run sales -- that the effects on producers might not show up for some time.    Indeed, she added, in the short term, for some producers, &quot;it could have been a modest positive.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
