(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Micom Systems Inc., a maker ofcomputer communications equipment, announced it had agreed to a$301 million buyout by a unit of the Odyssey Partners investmentgroup.   Micom, which has been on the market since March, said Tuesday ithad accepted an offer from MS1 Acquisition Group, an Odyssey unit,to pay $16 a share for Micom's 18.8 million shares.   The company didn't say if the deal would bring a change inmanagement.   The deal would be structured as a leveraged buyout, in whichloans for the purchase are repaid with money from the acquiredcompany's operations or by selling assets.   Micom, a maker of microcomputer-based equipment that allowscomputers to communicate with each other, has been torn recently bya dispute among management and three dissident directors.   The Los Angeles Times, quoting anonymous sources, said thedissidents, including founder William A. Norred, were unhappy withthe company's lagging stock price and with what they considered anoverpriced acquisition of Spectrum Digital of Herndon, Va., lastyear.   Other dissident directors were San Diego investors John andSally Thornton, who are the company's largest stockholders with 2.3million shares. Norred founded the company 15 years ago and steppedaside as chief executive in 1985.   Micom originally sought to buy out the dissidents, but put thecompany on the market after offers surfaced.   The company allowed a $15.62-per-share buyout offer to expirelast month. That was a joint proposal from Welsh, Carson, Andersonandamp; Stowe IV and Warburg Pincus Capital Co.   New York-based Odyssey, founded in 1982 by former Oppenheimer andamp;Co. executives Jack Nash and Leon Levy, has been involved in anumber of investments, including the 1983 purchase of ChicagoMilwaukee Corp. and subsequent asset sales said to have netted thepartnership about $200 million.</TEXT></DOC>
