Lesotho, a small landlocked enclave within South Africa, isexploring a plan to host talks between the black majority and thewhite minority government of the larger nation, he said.   ``Lesotho is well positioned to play a role in the process offacilitating reconciliation between the people of South Africa,''he told reporters.   In his meetings with Vice President Dan Quayle and top StateDepartment officials, Moshoeshoe said he would ask that ``pressurebe brought to bear'' on South Africa to allow safe passage intoLesotho of the exiled ANC leadership from neighboring Africanstates.   South Africa blockaded Lesotho in 1986, saying it was trying toprevent the smuggling of ANC guerrillas and weapons into thekingdom. The strained relations with South Africa resulted in amilitary coup that overthrew the left-leaning prime minister LeabuaJonathan later that year.   Moshoeshoe governs in consultation with the military council,which holds most of the power and is on better terms with SouthAfrica than he is.   ``Our opposition to apartheid is without compromise,'' he said.While recent steps announced by newly elected President F.W. deKlerk to release political prisoners and allow blacks more freedomare welcome, he said, ``apartheid cannot be reformed.'' Thegovernment must free all political prisoners, legalize oppositionmovements and allow banned black leaders to return from exile, hesaid.   Moshoeshoe also said international pressure on South Africa mustbe kept up, but he cautioned that economic sanctions are alsodamaging to the economies of Lesotho and other so-called front-linestates that border South Africa.   Lesotho is completely surrounded by South Africa and totallydependent on it for its survival. The British-educated monarch saidhe was seeking foreign investment in the kingdom so that its 1.5million people could shake off their dependence on South Africa.</TEXT></DOC>
