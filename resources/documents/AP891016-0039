(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A schoolgirl's friendly visits withPanamanian pen pal Gen. Manuel Noriega have her neighbors and hercongressman shaking their heads.   ``If it was my daughter, she wouldn't be going,'' CityCouncilwoman Virginia Paulson said after 11-year-old Sarah Yorkleft last week for her second trip to Panama.   On Wednesday, Sarah and her father turned up beside Noriega asPanama's military leader lauded her as a ``meritorious daughter''of Panama City and an example of ``the truth of the United States,purity not hatred.''   After her meeting with Noriega, she repeated her support for thegeneral. She said he's ``very nice'' and she doesn't believe ``thebad things newspapers in the United States say about him.''   In the United States that day, U.S. leaders were talking aboutways to oust Noriega.   Rep. Bob Davis, R-Mich., said Sarah's visits to Noriega put theUnited States in an awkward position.   ``To have one of our little citizens go down there and betreated well is kind of an embarrassment for our government,''Davis said. ``It sends the wrong message that we, or some people inthis country, say Noriega is an all-right guy.''   The schoolgirl and her father, Mitchell, a prison guard, leftfor Panama on Oct. 8 and planned to return Tuesday to this northernmining town of about 5,000 people. The trip, which the Yorks say issafe despite a State Department travel warning, was delayed by theOct. 3 coup attempt.   The girl visited Noriega last October.   She sent her first letter to Noriega following his U.S.indictment on drug trafficking charges.   Her mother, Pauline, who accompanied her on the first visit butstayed behind this time, refuses to discuss the second trip.   Mayor Jack Morris said residents never had given much thought toPanama.   ``It was nice to have somebody go to another country,'' he said.   But he rejected Mrs. York's request that Negaunee find a sistercity in Panama.   ``It just wouldn't be proper,'' Morris said.   After her first trip, Sarah set up school exhibits and helpedclassmates become pen pals with children in Panama. NegauneeSchools Superintendent Don Mourand said very few parents complained.   ``I believe parental choice is certainly come to force here,''Mourand said. ``The parents of Sarah have decided to allow her tobe exposed to many things the average child is not exposed to. ...Unfortunately she's being characterized by many people as beingnaive, as being non-American.   ``She just has a natural curiosity about other people,'' Mourandsaid.</TEXT></DOC>
