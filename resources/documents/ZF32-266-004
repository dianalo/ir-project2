 The DOS usercommunity was clamoring for two things: the ability to view more than oneapplication on the same screen and a Mac-like graphical user interface.andO;Windows 3.0 was likewise inevitable.andP;  It had to fix the problems of earlierversions: memory restrictions, unacceptable performance, and limitedintegration between applications.andM;But, in a very real way, Windows 3.0 is a marketing move, not a technologyadvance.andP;  Windows was not originally destined to become a long-termenvironment.andP;  Microsoft was really convinced that the PC industry needed amore advanced, multitasking operating system on the desktop.andP;  The company,along with partner IBM, named OS/2 as heir apparent to DOS.andP;  And they wereright!andP;  The next generation of applications--object-oriented workgroupsystems and on-line transaction processing (OLTP) with transactionmonitoring--need multitasking, multithreading, security, etc., all the morerobust capabilities of 32-bit OS/2.andP;  This type of application can't work onDOS.andM;But Microsoft made several mistakes with the OS/2 launch.andP;  For one, it set upfalse expectations and time frames.andP;  Microsoft underestimated the difficultydevelopers would have learning to write applications for OS/2.andP;  This steeplearning curve was aggravated by a lack of development tools.andP;  The companyhas gone a long way toward filling this gap with OS/2 2.0 SoftwareDevelopment Kit (SDK), which is impressive and should help build the momentumin OS/2 software development.andM;Nonetheless, Microsoft was faced with only a fraction of the interest in OS/2that it anticipated, while Windows development seemed to be picking up.andP;  Thecompany, nothing if not market savvy, shifted gears and went after theWindows market.andM;PRODUCT IMPROVEMENTS.andP;  In brief, the major areas of improvement of Windows3.0 comprise five categories:andM;Memory and Performance.andP;  Windows 3.0 has broken the 640K barrier.andP;  Itaccesses up to 16MB of extended memory by taking advantage of the protectedmode of the 286 and 386.andP;  On 386 systems with 1MB extended memory, a portionof the hard disk can be allocated as virtual memory, allowing code and datato be paged to disk.andM;User Interface.andP;  The new Windows 3.0 shell closely resembles bothPresentation Manager and Motif with its 3-D graphics and screen layout.andP;  Themajor elements of the new interface include the following:andM;* The Program Manager icon-based application starter, which enablesdouble-clicking to open both a file and its associated application.andM;* The File Manager, which provides maps of local drives as well as networkconnections.andP;  The File Manager also provides a tree view--as opposed to astandard list--of directories, files, and programs.andM;* The Task List, which displays a list of all loaded applications from whichyou can switch to the appropriate applications window.andM;* The Color Palette manager, which is a behind-the-scenes operation thathelps ensure the best rendition of color when several color-intensiveapplications are loaded.andM;Connectivity.andP;  Windows has had trouble working on LANs in the past.andP;  Theaccess to additional memory in Windows 3.0 helps alleviate these problems.andO;Certain network resources are available from within the Windows environment,including the ability to connect and disconnect to file servers and printers,and manipulating the jobs in a print queue.andM;Usability.andP;  The Setup program has been significantly enhanced, makinginstallation much simpler.andP;  For example, Setup will recognize whether you arerunning on a 286 or a 386 and optimize installation accordingly.andP;  The 3.0Control Panel offers more options for customization than did the previousversions.andM;Graphical Desktop Accessories.andP;  The Windows' desktop applications have beenenhanced.andP;  Aside from some standard accessories, such as clock, calculator,calendar, and several games (solitaire and Reversi), the desktop applicationsinclude:andM;* Recorder, a simple macro recorder that works across different WindowsapplicationsandM;* Windows Paintbrush, a color paint program from ZSoftandM;* Terminal, extended terminal emulation capabilitiesandM;* Cardfile, a simple database with autodial capabilitiesandM;* Notepad, an ASCII editorandM;* Windows Write, a basic WYSIWYG word processorandM;THE ASYMETRIX CONNECTION.andP;  Paul Allen, who, along with Bill Gates, foundedMicrosoft, has a new company called Asymetrix.andP;  The close relationshipbetween Allen and Gates has obviously remained intact.andP;  Asymetrix's firstproduct, ToolBook 1.0, is a &quot;software construction set&quot; for Windows 3.0.andO;With ToolBook, nonprogrammers can build custom graphical applications bydrawing objects and using hypertext facilities to link data.andP;  Sample ToolBookapplications can be used as a basis for new applications built by the user.andM;More sophisticated users can create more complex applications usingOpenScript, an object-oriented programming language.andP;  OpenScript isextensible through Windows Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs), which can accessother Windows applications or applications written in C.andP;  ToolBookapplications can also send messages between custom applications and otherWindows applications through Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE).andM;But Asymetrix has done more than just develop an end-user visual programmingtool for Windows.andP;  It is making sure that there are ToolBook users out thereby bundling a run-time version of ToolBook with every English-language copyof Windows 3.0.andP;  The run-time version cannot be used to develop applications;for that, you need the $395 version of ToolBook 1.0.andP;  But any Windows 3.0user can run existing ToolBook applications, including DayBook, a personal&quot;Daytimer-like&quot; organizer also bundled into Windows 3.0.andM;The licensing agreement looks like a win-win-win situation all around.andO;Asymetrix wins by virtually ensuring that any sophisticated Windows 3.0installation will buy at least one copy of ToolBook 1.0--after all, thecustomer already has the user software for free.andP;  Microsoft wins by offeringan easy-to-use, object-oriented, end-user development program which can alsobe used by sophisticated customers (much more accessible than the Basic-likeend-user macro language Microsoft plans to offer).andP;  And the users win byhaving such tools available at only the price of a single developmentversion.andM;ISV COMMITMENT.andP;  One of the proving grounds for new platforms is how wellthey attract third-party application development.andP;  Windows 3.0 is doing verywell in that area.andP;  Not only are virtually all existing Windows applicationsupgrading to 3.0 versions, but developers who never planned to support theWindows platform are rearranging their corporate strategies to hurry theirWindows 3.0 products out the door.andM;The most notable in this category is Word Perfect Corporation.andP;  For thelongest time, Word Perfect refused to port its ubiquitous word processingsoftware to Windows.andP;  The company did make a commitment to providing an OS/2PM version, which was originally due this past spring.andP;  Then, this year, WordPerfect read the handwriting on the wall and announced that it would releasea Windows 3.0 version about six months after the PM application.andP;  Windows 3.0was introduced, and the customers went wild.andP;  Word Perfect revised itsstrategy and will first deliver a Windows version within a few months, withthe OS/2 product to follow a few months later.andM;This is indeed a coup for Windows 3.0.andP;  It has attracted all the existingWindows developers, the third-party DOS developers who hadn't written forWindows 286 or 386, and, finally, some new products that are being writtenfirst to Windows 3.0, such as Asymetrix ToolBook (see above) and NBI'sLegacy, a compound document WYSIWYG editor (see Vol.andP;  13, No.andP;  6).andM;Software Commitments.andP;  The list of software publishers shipping new orupdated Windows applications runs five pages.andP;  Here are highlights:andM;Adobe Systems  Streamline and IllustratorandM;Aldus  PageMakerandM;Asymetrix  ToolBookandM;Bitstream  FontwareandM;Corel Systems  Corel Draw!andM;Fulcrum  Fulcrum Ful/Text TechnologiesandM;Gupta  SQL Windows TechnologiesandM;IBM Desktop  Current SoftwareandM;Informix Software  WingZandM;Lotus Corporation  Notes Microsoft  Excel, Word, Project, PowerpointandM;NBI  LegacyandM;Novell  LAN Workplace for DOSandM;ParcPlace  Objectworks for Systems  Smalltalk 80andM;Samna  Ami and Corporation  Ami ProfessionalandM;Saros Corporation  FileShareandM;Wall Data  Rumba for Incorporated  WindowsandM;Xerox Desktop  FormBase and Software  Ventura PublisherandM;THE UPSIDE.andP;  There is a lot to admire in the new Windows besides themarketing hype.andP;  The interface is appealing and provides a common look andbehavior with PM and Motif on the Unix side.andP;  The crippling 640K barrier isgone.andP;  Performance is significantly improved.andP;  The windowing environmentprovides cut-and-paste buffers between applications, as well as across-application, keystroke-capture macro facility, thus providing a levelof integration between applications.andM;And then there is protection of investment.andP;  Commercial America--indeed, thecommercial market worldwide--runs on PCs.andP;  These PCs run DOS.andO;Mission-critical applications have been written in DOS.andP;  The installedinvestment in hardware, software, and data is immeasurable.andM;Moving to a newer operating system endangers this investment.andP;  The quickerthe migration to a multitasking 32-bit operating system--say, just forargument's sake, OS/2--the quicker the death knell for DOS.andP;  Windows 3.0, forall the reasons mentioned above, will extend the life of DOS.andP;  To most users,this is a terrific thing.andM;THE DOWNSIDE.andP;  Windows 3.0 has some technological limitations.andP;  For example,older Windows applications cannot take full advantage of 3.0 and must run inreal mode, which maintains the 640K limitation.andM;Windows 3.0 and Presentation Manager look alike, but, even though bothsupport DDE, their applications cannot interoperate--though some users stillbelieve they can.andP;  Windows clients can't access OS/2 applications.andP;  OS/2users have to run Windows applications in the DOS compatibility box.andP;  Thiswill change when OS/2 2.0 becomes available.andP;  The DOS compatibility box willgo away in favor of multiple virtual DOS machines (MVDMs).andP;  Also in OS/2 2.0,Microsoft is promising the ability to run a Windows binary.andP;  Note, however,that this is a future direction, not a current capability.andM;Windows 3.0 requires 1MB of memory, thus requiring an upgrade of many of thePCs out there in businesses.andP;  Now the upgrade to 1MB isn't very expensive,but, for any robust or complex application, 1MB won't get you very far.andP;  Manyusers will have to put about 3MB on their systems for Windows to supporttheir memory-intensive applications adequately.andP;  This negates much of theprice differential users were expecting between Windows and OS/2.andP;  Theanticipated savings may be marginal.andM;USER REACTIONS.andP;  Users, in general, seem happy with 3.0.andP;  We've heardcomments such as, &quot;I had moved my people to the Mac.andP;  Now I can move themback to the PC.&quot;andP;  One large financial organization has approved $300 perdesktop to upgrade all its thousands of PCs to over 1MB with Windows 3.0.andM;&quot;Protects investment&quot;--that's the essential comment.andM;The users we spoke to weren't particularly concerned with the limitations ofDOS.andP;  &quot;Gives me what I want, cut-and paste between applications, the abilityto see different applications on the screen at the same time.&quot;andM;&quot;But Windows isn't really multi-tasking,&quot; we point out.andM;&quot;That's okay,&quot; replies a user.andP;  &quot;It looks as if it is.&quot;andM;WINDOWS 3 PLUS.andP;  Steve Balmer, vice president at Microsoft, has taken tocalling OS/2 &quot;Windows 3 Plus&quot; in an attempt to show the close relationship(?!) between Windows and OS/2.andM;But Windows doesn't interoperate seamlessly with OS/2.andP;  Oh, you can haveWindows and OS/2 machines on the same network, but they aren't running thesame applications.andP;  And it isn't simple to port an application from DOS toOS/2.andP;  Developers need to create two separate client versions of the sameapplication to run in both environments.andM;Thus, in applications where people need to work together, they must go withthe lowest common denominator, which would be the DOS applications.andM;CONCLUSION.andP;  Windows 3.0 is a market darling.andP;  It solves a large immediateproblem for PC users.andP;  It means that the anticipated major investment in newhardware, software, and training can be put off for years.andM;But so will robust multitasking applications.andM;Microsoft has been sending mixed messages.andP;  For years, it said that theindustry needed a robust, dynamic operating system for next-generationapplications; adding a pretty face to DOS wasn't enough.andP;  And OS/2 was thatoperating system.andP;  Now, the company is saying that what we need is a GUI.andO;Don't worry about the limitations of DOS; be happy with the pretty pictures.andM;We believe that Microsoft was right the first time.andP;  Pretty DOS is notenough.andP;  Windows is still DOS, warts hidden, but lying there under thesurface.andP;  While the introduction of Windows 3.0 provides a temporary panaceafor commercial users, as a result, next-generation applications will bestalled by up to five years.andM;Can we really afford that?andO;</TEXT></DOC>
