One witness said suspects were forced tostand on one foot under the hot sun.   The army clamped a curfew on Nablus, the West Bank's largestcity. It was the second shooting of an Israeli soldier since theArab uprising against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and GazaStrip began Dec. 8.   In a crackdown on the recent wave of firebomb attacks on Israelitargets, troops demolished seven houses of Arab suspects and sealedfive other homes in the West Bank. Soldiers have been ordered toshoot at firebomb throwers with the intent to injure and todemolish the homes of suspects.   Elsewhere in the West Bank, dozens of Jewish settlers, somewearing prayer shawls, blocked a major highway for two hours todemand harsh army action against Palestinian firebombers.   The army said the reserve soldier was traveling in his own carwhen he was hit by a bullet. A spokesman declined to say if thesoldier was in uniform.   The wounded soldier was taken by helicopter to a Tel Avivhospital and the shooting was being investigated, the spokesmansaid. He said the soldier was slightly injured, but refused toelaborate or identify him.   The other Israeli soldier shot during the uprising, Sgt. MosheKatz, 28, died of a head wound received in the West Bank town ofBethlehem on March 20.   Troops conducted a search for suspects and the weapon, sealingoff Nablus and prohibiting all drivers except Jewish settlers wholive nearby from entering or leaving the city. Nablus is 40 milesnorth of Jerusalem.   Four hours after the shooting, about 60 cars were lined upoutside Nablus and an equal number were lined up inside the citywaiting to pass a roadblock manned by three jeeploads of troops.   A United Nations vehicle, a car belonging to the Red Cross andan Arab ambulance were turned back.   Arab witnesses said troops rounded up dozens of Palestinians,confiscated their identity cards and fired shots in the air.   ``It seems the army is very angry because this is the first timeI've seen them this strict. They are shooting in the air likecrazy,'' said Nablus businessman Said Kenaan.   Abu Islam Deedi, an Arab reporter who lives in Nablus, saidtroops detained about 50 suspects and lined them up against walls.   During questioning under the hot summer sun, the Arabs were madeto stand on one leg with their arms outstretched, said Deedi, whosaid he watched the roundup from a window in his home.   Deedi said troops also wired off streets where the shootingoccurred and erected about 10 roadblocks in the city center wherethey stopped and searched Palestinian cars. He said severalbusloads of troops patrolled the streets.   According to army figures, 346 soldiers have been injured sincethe uprising began, most of them by stones. The United Nations putsthe Palestinian death toll at 208. Two Israelis also have beenkilled.   Underground leaders of the uprising ordered Palestinians toobserve Thursday as a day for stockpiling food, first aid suppliesand gasoline to prolong their resistance to Israel's 21-yearoccupation.   Arabs from a bus stalled at the roadblock descended and beganthrowing rocks at the settlers, who responded by hurling them back,Israel radio and a Jewish settler said. The army fired in the airto disperse the stone-throwers, then dismantled the roadblock.   About 60 Jewish settlers from the West Bank settlement of Efrat,meanwhile, used their cars to block the major Jerusalem-Hebronhighway used by thousands of Arab workers to get to their jobs inIsrael.   The settlers said in a statement the action was to protest anincrease in Palestinian firebomb attacks. The army responded to thestepped up attacks by orders this week to shoot firebombers.   Also Thursday, a 17-year-old Palestinian prostitute was chargedin a Jerusalem district court with the shooting death of a Jewishseminary student earlier this month. The charge sheet allegesnationalistic motives.   A military court sentenced four Palestinians convicted ofthrowing firebombs. Three were sentenced to 10 years in prison forhurling a homemade gasoline bomb at a civilian car Jan. 31 inJerusalem. The fourth was given eight years for throwing a firebombat a military jeep in Jerusalem on Feb. 26.</TEXT></DOC>
