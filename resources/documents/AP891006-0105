But the Chicago-based company which is recruiting for the coursesaid Friday that the first session, scheduled to start in Israel onNov. 25, would probably be canceled because applicants so far lackthe required experience.   Ads which appeared in recent months in journals devoted tomilitary and police issues described the Israeli course asconsisting of ``all phases of hands-on anti-terrorism training,ending with a helicopter assault to rescue hostages from built-upareas or from aircraft.''   The training is being conducted by Hod Hahanit, an Israelisecurity firm run by reserve Col. Yair Klein. Colombia last monthissued an arrest warrant for Klein and for another Israeli,accusing them of training drug cartel hit squads.   Klein told police investigating the case in Israel that hetrained Colombian farmers to protect themselves against leftistguerrillas and was unaware of any connection to the country's druglords.   Michael Epstein, who runs a security company calledInternational Association of Airborne Veterans Ltd., said his firmhad received the franchise from Hod Hahanit, Hebrew for Spearhead,to ``run foreigners through the Israeli anti-terrorism training.''   The course costs $3,685, including round trip air fare from NewYork to Tel Aviv, lodging, meals and insurance, according to theprinted information issued by Epstein's firm. Epstein said 15applicants had sent him deposits and their money would be refundedbecause most of them were not qualified.   He said the decision to scrap the first session was notconnected in any way to the Israeli police investigation of Kleinand several other officers involved in security work abroad.   The application form asks applicants about their military orpolice service, their rank and awards they have received.   ``Your physical condition must be superior,'' according to theads.   ``The course is the most comprehensive and professional in theworld today. The Israelis are the number one in the world today forterrorist prevention, protection ... and hostage rescue,''according to the ads.   Klein is at the top of a list of seven Israeli instructors, allof them reserve officers with ranks ranging from major to majorgeneral.   The list of courses includes lectures on anti-terrorism combat,submachine gun use, sniper training in daylight or at night, andfamiliarization with Soviet-made weapons such as AK-47 rifles androcket-propelled grenades.   There is also a course in driving techniques, including shootingfrom and at a vehicle, employment of helicopters, combat inbuilt-up areas and rappelling.   Other classes include hostage negotiations, endurance trainingand ``classified training not to be published.'' The ads do notelaborate on the last item.</TEXT></DOC>
