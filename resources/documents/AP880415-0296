Grain futuresalso retreated.   On other markets, cattle futures finished higher after reversingsharp losses; pork futures moved lower; oil futures advanced forthe fifth straight day; precious metals and stock-index futuresposted slight gains.   Soybeans declined on a combination of bearish fundamentals,including good harvest weather for the South American soybean crop,disappointing export sales last week and relatively high cashprices for soybeans and soybean products, analysts said.   ``We're just way out of whack with prices for cottonseed mealand corn,'' making soybeans less attractive on the world market,said Richard Loewy, senior grain and oilseed analyst forPrudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.   The government released grain export sales figures Thursday forthe week ending April 7, showing shipments of both soybeans andsoybean meal were down about 60 percent from the previous week.   The rally last week that pushed new-crop soybean futures wellabove $7 a bushel likely persuaded more farmers to plant soybeans,another bearish factor, said Joel Karlin, an analyst forChicago-based Research Department Inc.   Analysts said Chicago-based Candamp;D Commodities, the largestspeculative firm on the floor, led the decline by selling largenumbers of contracts for soybeans and soybean products that it hadpurchased in recent weeks.   Wheat settled 2{ cents to 3} cents lower with the contract fordelivery in May at $3.12} a bushel; corn was 1{ cents to 2{ centslower with May at $2.02} a bushel; oats were { cent to 1{ centslower with May at $1.60 a bushel; soybeans were 13 cents to 16cents lower with May at $6.62{ a bushel.   Cattle futures rode a roller coaster on the Chicago MercantileExchange with the contract for April delivery falling to 72.50cents a pound, then rallying to settle at 73.97 cents, 15 pointsabove Thursday's settlement.   Traders were counting on Friday's lower wholesale beef pricesand forecasts for warmer weather to spark a resurgence of retailbuying for outdoor cookouts, said Chuck Levitt, an analyst inChicago for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.   ``The abiltiy of the market to shake off its early severe lossestoday indicated anticipation of better retail business next week,''he said.   The lower prices for pork futures reflected concerns about theweek's unusually high slaughter numbers, Levitt said.   ``There is no sign of a seasonal letup in supplies,'' he said.``Until we start to see the marketings subside, the market willstruggle with the large production.''   Live cattle settled .10 cent lower to .37 cent higher with Aprilat 73.97 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .30cent higher with April at 79.67 cents a pound; hogs were .32 centlower to .07 cent higher with April at 44.70 cents a pound; frozenpork bellies were .03 cent lower to .90 cent higher with May at52.05 cents a pound.   Crude-oil futures advanced for the fifth straight day on the NewYork Mercantile Exchange on expectations that OPEC and non-OPECcountries will agree to limit oil production when they meet in asession tentatively scheduled for April 26.   Some members of the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries appear unwilling to cut their production, but the markethas so far ignored those bearish signals, said Michael Rothman,senior oil analyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents to 8 centshigher with May at $18.37 a barrel; heating oil was .24 cent to .43cent higher with May at 49.75 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was.25 cent to .33 cent higher with May at 52.61 cents a gallon.   Gold futures advanced on New York's Commodity Exchange in quiettrading following the government's release of a report showing a0.6 percent rise in wholesale prices last month. Silver was nearlyunchanged.   The market was expecting an increase of about 0.3 percent inwholesale prices, and analysts had expected the inflationaryimplications of a greater rise to send gold prices soaring.   Gold settled $1.90 to $2.80 higher with June at $458.50 a troyounce; silver was 0.5 cent to 1 cent higher with May at $6.475 atroy ounce.   Stock-index futures posted slight gains on the ChicagoMercantile Exchange, where the contract for June delivery of theStandard andamp; Poor's 500 index settled 0.4 point higher at 258.80.</TEXT></DOC>
