The present study estimated prospectivelythe prevalence and clinical significance of Ga-67 uptake in the heartin 62 patients 10 to 16 days after open-heart surgery. Of 62 patientsstudied, markedly diffuse Ga-67 uptake was detected in 21 (34%) and focalor mild diffuse uptake in 23 (37%). Results were negative in 18 (29%).Nine patients with a negative scan result (50%) had received corticosteroidtherapy before imaging, whereas only 2 patients with a positive scanresult (5%) were receiving steroids. The erythrocyte sedimentation rateand C-reactive protein level were both higher in patients with Ga-67uptake compared with those with a negative scan result (p less than 0.01in both). No other clinical, echocardiographic or electrocardiographicindicators of postpericardiotomy syndrome were related to Ga-67 uptake.No patient developed cardiac tamponade or constrictive pericarditis duringthe 12-week follow-up and the Ga-67 scan results did not predict theocclusion of coronary artery bypass grafts. Thus, pericardial inflammationmanifested as Ga-67 uptake is a common finding after open-heart surgeryand appears to be a benign condition.</TEXT></DOC>
