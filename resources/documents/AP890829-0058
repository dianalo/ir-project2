Police searching for the young man suspected of firing the fatalshot were reported considering the possibility he might have fled toItaly. Another young man, who police believe was the leader of thegang of whites, said the killing was not racially motivated.   Police said the gang in the mostly Italian neighborhood inBrooklyn attacked four black youths, who had gone to look at a carfor sale, because they believed the four were going to visit a youngwoman who had spurned one of the gang members. A shot was fired and16-year-old Yusef Hawkins was killed.   On Monday, Joseph Serrano, 20, surrendered to police and wascharged with first-degree assault, first-degree riot, aggravatedharassment, menacing and civil rights violations, police said. Fiveothers who had been arrested were released on bail Sunday.   Also on Monday, there were signs that tempers were cooling offfollowing two days of racial confrontations.   About a dozen blacks led about 150 white residents on a shortwalk through the streets where the killing occurred. Dozens ofpeople, angry over a third day of demonstrations in theirneighborhood, stood facing the demonstrators but were quieter andless confrontational than residents had been Saturday and Sunday.   The purported group leader, 18-year-old Keith Mondello, toldWABC-TV on Monday that the youths believed the victim was among agroup coming to the Bensonhurst neighborhood to beat up residents.   ``I was told that 25 blacks were coming to beat me and my friendsup and the only reason the baseball bats were on the scene werebecause we wanted to protect ourselves and we didn't know if theywere going to be armed,'' Mondello said.   Mondello said the attack could have occurred ``no matter whatcolor they were. If someone was coming to beat me and my friends, wewould do anything to protect ourselves.''   Police say at least one witness has named 18-year-old Joseph Famaas the gunman.   The New York Times reported in today's editions that detectivesbelieve Fama remains in the United States, but are checking to seeif he has fled to Italy. Fama holds dual American and Italiancitizenship.</TEXT></DOC>
