For some of the oil industry's giants, that should come asgood news. Exxon Corp., for example, poured $4 billion intoNorwegian oil and gas investments over 24 years beforemanaging its first annual profit on the investment in 1989. Aboom for Norwegian natural gas ought to be a windfall.</LP><TEXT>   But Exxon is grumbling, and so are Royal Dutch/ShellGroup, Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine, Mobil Corp. and mostother international oil companies operating Norwegianconcessions. All have stakes in promising offshorenatural-gas fields, and all are unhappy with the meager rolethey're being permitted to play.   The Norwegian government has long kept a tight rein onmultinationals operating in its oil patch -- where it retainsat least a 50% interest in every field. In part, the tighthold reflects a policy of fostering development of domesticoil companies by giving them preferential treatment inawarding oil-field licenses.   The current flap is over which companies will be allowedto develop their reserves to fill new supply contracts.Norway's Petroleum Ministry is expected by year end toauthorize development of an additional 9.3 billion cubicmeters of natural-gas capacity, boosting Norway's productionpotential by one-third current levels. Being chosen can meanbillions of dollars in profits.   The multinationals fret that there won't be enough newawards to go around. They maintain that clever salesmanshipcould bring in plenty of new gas contracts, justifying aneven faster pace of development. But politicians have givenNorway's three oil companies exclusive control over all gassales, and the multinationals complain that as a result theyaren't being allowed enough say on marketing efforts.   There may be more at stake here than petro-profits.According to the International Energy Agency in Paris, demandfor natural gas in Europe is expected to surge more than 30%by the end of this decade to 460 billion cubic metersannually -- and to rise an additional 25% in the followingdecade. The expected growth reflects a proliferation of toughenvironmental rules in Europe that will force manyelectricity-generating companies and other industrial energyusers to switch to clean-burning natural gas.   The Soviet Union was long expected to fill much of the newdemand, but economic and political turmoil there has erodedits reliability as a supplier. Industry sources say theSoviets have been telling potential customers they are soldout for the next few years, so gas-hungry customers in Europeare turning to Norway.   But Norway's government often responds cautiously toindustry pressure for faster development. &quot;Our job is to dowhat's good for Norway,&quot; says Gunnar Gjerde, the top-rankingnatural-gas expert at the Ministry of Petroleum. &quot;We aren'ttoo concerned about the fight for profit between companies --or whether certain companies come out good or bad fromspecific decisions.&quot;   Among other gripes, multinational oil concerns resentbeing excluded from negotiations with potential natural-gascustomers. State oil concern Statoil AS along with NorskHydro AS and Saga Petroleum AS have taken over the leadingrole once played by the multinationals. For example, Shell,and to a lesser extent Exxon and Mobil, were instrumentalfive years ago in lining up a 25-year, $64 billion contractto sell natural gas from Norway's Troll field to distributorsin France, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands.   &quot;After investing billions of dollars in a new field, it'severy company's right to have some control on the commercialside,&quot; says Owe Prebe, director of gas sales for Shell'sNorwegian unit. &quot;Our shareholders are frustrated at what theyperceive to be an `A team' of Norwegian companies and a `Bteam' of international ones.&quot;   Oil companies and the Petroleum Ministry now project thatnatural-gas production in Norway will hit at least 60 billioncubic meters annually by 2005, doubling the current level.That would make Norway the No. 1 oil and gas producer inEurope, supplanting the U.K., today's leader.   Clearly, demand is rising. National Power PLC, a recentlyprivatized British electric utility, signed a 15-yearcontract in April to buy 2.2 billion cubic meters of gasannually starting in the mid-1990s. And gas distributors inJuly exercised an option to boost deliveries under the Trollfield contract by 30%. Meanwhile, talks with British Gas PLCabout selling up to five billion cubic meters a year ofNorwegian gas are thought to be at an advanced stage, andStatoil is in talks with many other prospective customers.   It's partly to fill such orders that the PetroleumMinistry is expected to authorize the additional 9.3 billioncubic meters of annual capacity. The ministry could decidesimply to tap some of the Shell-operated Troll field's unusedcapacity. But Exxon and Saga are jockeying for permission todevelop discoveries of theirs, and Elf Aquitaine hopes to beallowed to hook up new finds adjacent to the existinginfrastructure at its Frigg field.   Exxon has its hopes riding on the giant Sleipner gasfield, in which it holds a 30.4% interest. The field has beenripe for development since 1984 but has been stalled bypolitical squabbling.   &quot;We have a giant commitment here,&quot; says B.L. Boyd, a vicepresident for Exxon's Norwegian unit. &quot;You can't just get madand walk away.&quot;   Indeed, Exxon's combined holdings of oil and natural gasin Norway are equivalent to about 1.5 billion barrels of oil,or roughly 10% of the company's entire global reserves.Others have a lot riding on Norway, too. For Elf Aquitaine,Norway accounts for more than 20% of the French company'stotal reserves. Industry analysts estimate that Norway sitson 15% of the world's oil and gas reserves outside the formercommunist bloc.</TEXT></DOC>
