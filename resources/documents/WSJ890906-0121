Five insiders, including the company's new chairman and its president, have sold chunks of Liz Claiborne stock since May, according to reports submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission. And a company spokeswoman said there have been subsequent sales by insiders that haven't yet shown up in SEC filings.    Do these corporate insiders know something the legions of investors bullish on this apparel maker don't?    Analysts say no. Glowing reports have been issued in the past two months by Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co., First Boston Corp. and Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., which rated the company an &quot;aggressive buy&quot; for both the short- and long-term.    Despite initial nervousness about what would happen after founder Liz Claiborne retired from the management of the company in May, the stock has &quot;a lot of momentum,&quot; said Barbara L. Kahn, analyst at Kidder Peabody. Ms. Claiborne's absence &quot;in the day to day operations hasn't caused the hiccup in the stock that skeptics had anticipated.&quot;    The company's rosy outlook isn't without some thorns, however. Some analysts fret about its move to broaden its base out of apparel sales and manufacturing into retailing, with its own stores. The move could end up undercutting the company's revenues from department stores, they say.    But &quot;earnings growth alone should support continued appreciation,&quot; according to Ms. Kahn. In the second quarter, New York City-based Claiborne said its net rose 57% to 33 cents a share from 21 cents a year earlier.    What, then, accounts for the wave of insider selling?    Chairman Jerome Chazen sold 100,000 shares, or 3% of his company stock, a week before Ms. Claiborne formally stepped down. &quot;Basically, the sales that I've made have been for a combination of taxes and estate planning,&quot; said Mr. Chazen.    The company's president, Harvey Falk, sold half his stake in the firm, 30,000 shares for $667,500, shortly before being elected to the top position in May, according to SEC filings. Mr. Falk couldn't be reached for comment.    Sam Miller, chief financial officer for the company, said Mr. Falk and two vice presidents who also sold shares were &quot;largely selling stakes they acquired through options.&quot; After a holding period, they sold the shares to pay taxes or to pay off loans originally taken to purchase those options from the company, he said.    In the most recent insider sales reported to the SEC, Leonard Boxer, a director, sold 20,000 Liz Claiborne shares for $488,800 in separate sales on July 7 and July 20. The sale brought the total number of shares Mr. Boxer sold since the beginning of the year to 140,000, or 7% of his holdings in the company.    Mr. Miller said Mr. Boxer was a founder of the company and had a very large Liz Claiborne stake. He sold to diversify his assets, according to Mr. Miller.    Liz Claiborne closed yesterday at $27, down 50 cents in national over-the-counter trading.    ---   THE TAXMAN COMETH? Joe C. Davis, a director of Mapco Inc., sold 50,000 shares of the Tulsa, Okla., oil and gas concern for $1.9 million on July 27. Since May, Mr. Davis has sold a total of 432,500 Mapco shares, or 27% of his stake in the firm.    Mr. Davis declined to comment on the sale, but a spokesman for the company said Mr. Davis had a series of stock sales &quot;for tax reasons having to do with the dissolution of his coal company,&quot; Nashville-based Davis Coal.    Mr. Davis received $39.13 per share in his most recent sale. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Mapco closed at $38.50, up 25 cents.    ---   STEEL SALES: There's been active buying by insiders in Birmingham Steel Corp. shares for the past two years. But recently, two insiders sold shares, the first sale by insiders since January of 1988, according to SEC filings.    The sales came shortly after Birmingham, which is based in Birmingham, Ala., reported on Aug. 1, that fourth-quarter earnings were down to 59 cents a share from 76 cents a share. In a July 18 report, Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Inc. assigned a &quot;hold/sell&quot; rating to the stock.    Robert Powell, controller of the company, sold 3,500 shares on Aug. 3, for $21 each. The sale represented 32% of his stake in the company. Mr. Powell said he has been waiting to sell his shares, to meet personal needs, for some time, but that company policy allows such transactions only after earnings have been reported.    M. Monroe Fields Jr., vice president of human resources, sold 12,000 shares on Aug. 8, or 33% of his stake. Mr. Fields said he sold his shares for personal reasons, rather than any &quot;perception of the way the company is doing.&quot; He added that he had optioned the shares nine months ago and had been waiting for the right time to sell.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Birmingham Steel closed at $23.75, down 12.5 cents.    ---   PRESIDENT SELLS: James H. Levergood, president of Scientific-Atlanta Inc. sold 45% of his stake in the telecommunications company in August, according to SEC filings. He received $479,370 for his 25,000 shares.    Mr. Levergood said he sold the shares to pay back a loan he had taken to play the stock market in 1987. &quot;Then we crashed and burned,&quot; he said. &quot;It's a sad story.&quot;    He is the fifth officer of the company to sell large chunks of Scientific-Atlanta stock this year. The other insiders sold from 44% to 100% of their holdings in the company, in sales ranging from 500 to 14,251 shares. The sale price ranged from $15 to $21.25 per share.    Robert Meyers, spokesman for the company, said &quot;a significant portion of our officer compensation is in options, so a significant portion of their net worth&quot; is in company stock. &quot;At times, they have financial needs, or wish to purchase additional options.&quot;    The sales don't &quot;indicate any lack of confidence on their part in the company.&quot; Mr. Meyers added that Mr. Levergood has options to purchase about another 110,000 shares.    Two weeks ago, Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. upgraded its investment rating of ScientificAtlanta stock to &quot;above average&quot; from &quot;neutral.&quot; Among other things, the firm said, Scientific-Atlanta's business should benefit from deregulation of cable television. Still, Merrill calls the stock &quot;speculative.&quot;    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the stock closed at $21.25, up 25 cents.    ---   Peter Pae in Pittsburgh contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
