TheJournal editorial-page stand strongly favors a free-tradeagreement with Mexico -- no strings attached -- that will, ifsuccessful, sadly doom millions more intelligent, promisingyoungsters to destructive and deadly child labor.   Compounding the harm done to hapless Mexican childrenwould be the injury to those thousands of American businesseslacking the means to move operations south or to the millionsof U.S. workers who cannot compete with $32-a-week wages.Until Mexico deals with its official corruption andineffective law enforcement, there never will be any kind oflevel playing field in our negotiations. Child labor, generallabor and environmental abuses will thrive and expand beyondour wildest imagination if we allow ourselves to be suckeredinto a free-trade agreement at this time.</LP><TEXT>   It would be morally reprehensible for the U.S. to embarkon a free-trade agreement without extensive preconditions andsafeguards prohibiting exploitation of children, workers ingeneral or the environment to protect Mexicans and,especially, ourselves. But perhaps connecting Americanbusiness with morality is a contradiction in terms.   James R. Dorcy   Fairfax, Va.   ---   Your article left me with one unanswered question. Iunderstand that a North American economic consortium (U.S.,Canada, Mexico) may in some small way affect our trade withJapan. I understand that the employment of minors in Mexicocould impede the illegal exodus of same to the U.S. Iunderstand that the Guerrero family is living in deplorableconditions and that their son's income helps them to eatbetter. I understand that the Mexican government cannot seethe damage being done to the future generations of Mexico bystrangling its most promising students.   What I cannot understand is why anyone with a socialconscience would purchase &quot;Made in Mexico&quot; merchandise.   Susan Norr Sunkle   Chagrin Falls, Ohio</TEXT></DOC>
