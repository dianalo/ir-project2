The Council adopted the Northwest Conservation and ElectricPower Plan (power plan) on April 27, 1983. The program and the power planhave been amended from time to time since then. Major revisions of theprogram were adopted in 1984 and 1987, and a major revision of the powerplan was adopted in 1986. On April 14, 1988 the Council voted to initiaterulemaking pursuant to section 4(d)(1) of the Northwest Power Act to amendthe program and the power plan to incorporate measures to protect criticalfish and wildlife habitat from new hydropower development. This noticecontains a brief description of the proposed amendments, describes howto obtain a full copy of the proposed amendments and background informationconcerning them, and explains how to participate in the amendment process.Public Comment: All written comments must be received in the Council'scentral office, 851 SW. Sixth Avenue, Suite 1100, Portland, Oregon, 97204,by 5 p.m. Pacific time on July 8, 1988. Comments should be submitted toDulcy Mahar, Director of Public involvement, at this address. Commentsshould be clearly marked ``Protected Areas Comments.''After the close of written comment, the Council may hold consultationswith interested parties to clarify points made in written comment, andwill supply notice of such consultations. Consultations may be held upto the time of the Council's final action in this rulemaking.Hearings: Public hearings will be held in Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington,beginning on or about May 11, 1988. If you wish to obtain a schedule ofthe hearings, or more information about this process, contact the Council'sPublic Involvewment Division, 851 SW. Sixth Avenue, Suite 1100, Portland,Oregon 97204 or (503) 222-5161, toll free 1-800-222-3355 in Idaho, Montana,and Washington or 1-800-452-2324 in Oregon. To reserve a time period forpresenting oral comments at a hearing, contact Ruth Curtis in the PublicInvolvement Division. Requests to reserve a time period for oral commentsmust be received no later than two work days before the hearing.Final Action: The Council expects to take final action on the proposedprotected areas amendments at its August 1988 meeting. The actual dateon which the Council will make its final decision will be announced inaccordance with applicable law and the Council's practice of providingnotice of its meeting agendas.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>A fuller version of this notice,including a paper entitled ``Protected Areas: Background and Test of ProposedAmendments,'' has been prepared that explains the reasons for the rulemaking,the process to date, summarizes the proposal itself, responds to certainissues raised in earlier comments, and sets out the text of the proposedamendments. In addition, the Council staff prepared an issue paper in October1987, entitled ``Protected Area Designations,'' which discusses the backgroundof this issue and identifies alternatives the Council has considered. Thosewishing to receive a copy of either paper should contact Judy Allenderat the address or telephone numbers listed above.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2><ITAG tagnum="84">1. Reasons for the Rulemaking</ITAG>Substantial losses of fish and wildlife habitat have occurred in the ColumbiaRiver Basin and in the region as a whole as a result of hydroelectric andother development. Past mitigation efforts have not been able to compensatefully for the effects of hydropower and other development. Not only ismitigation risky, it is expensive and time consuming. Protracted disputesover the possible effects of hydroelectric development on sensitive fishand wildlife populations are common. These disputes add to developer costsand utility rates, and leave the region less certain about its abilityto develop new resources quickly when they are needed. <ITAG tagnum="84">2. The Process to Date</ITAG>The Council initiated a process six years ago to study areas where developmentwould have substantial and irreversible adverse effects on fish and wildlife.Extensive studies of regional fish and wildlife habitat were conductedin the 1984-86 period, and data bases were developed for anadromous fish,resident fish and wildlife, and hydropower potential in the region. Commoncriteria were developed and adapted for each of the Northwest states toapply to the data to identify critical fish and wildlife habitat for protectionfrom future hydropower development. Their lists of critical habitat weresubmitted to the Council. The Council staff released an issue paper in October 1987, proposing thatthe Council designate the identified areas for protection from all futurehydropower development. About 416 written submissions were received from400 individuals or organizations. In addition, 8 consultations were heldwith interested parties, and public comment has been heard at three Councilmeetings. <ITAG tagnum="84">3. Protected Areas</ITAG>This notice outlines a Council proposal, not a final Council decision.The Council will consider all comments before making a final decision.Based on the studies referred to above, the Council has prepared a listof proposed protected areas. In protected areas where anadromous fish (salmonand steelhead trout) and wild resident (non sea-going) fish are present,the Council proposes to say that any development would involve unacceptablerisks of irreparable harm to such fish, their spawning grounds or habitat.In protected areas where non-wild resident fish or wildlife are present,the Council proposes to say that no hydropower development should occurthat would result in a net loss of such fish and wildlife, consideringpossibilities for mitigation. A copy of the Council's list of protectedareas is available on computer disc or hard copy, free of charge. Pleasecontact Judy Allender at the above address or telephone number for a copyof this list. <ITAG tagnum="84">4. Effects on Federal Agencies</ITAG>a. Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife ProgramThe proposed amendments would have their strongest effects through theColumbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program. The Council does not itselfregulate hydroelectric development through the fish and wildlife program,but influences federal agencies involved in operating, developing and regulatingthe hydropower system in the Columbia River Basin. Generally, fish andwildlife activities of the Bonneville Power Administration should be ``consistentwith'' the fish and wildlife program and the power plan within the ColumbiaRiver Basin. For nonfederal hydroelectric development, the Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission (FERC), which makes licensing decisions on particularhydroelectric project proposals, must take the program into account atall relevant stages of its decisionmaking processes ``to the fullest extentpracticable.'' b. Northwest Conservation and Electric Power PlanThe proposed amendments to the Northwest Conservation and Electric PowerPlan would guide Bonneville resource acquisitions throughout the PacificNorthwest region, and would not be confined to the Columbia River Basin.As a comprehensive plan that balances regional energy and fish and wildlifeneeds, the power plan merits the FERC's consideration under the ElectricConsumers Protection Act of 1986. <ITAG tagnum="84">5. Applies Only to New Hydropower Projects</ITAG>The proposed amendments would apply only to new hydropower projects, notto existing dams. A new hydropower project would be a new structure containinghydroelectric facilities for which FERC has not issued a license. <ITAG tagnum="84">6. No Effect on State Sovereignty or Water Rights</ITAG>The Northwest Power Planning Council is not a federal agency, but is anorganization of the four Northwest states with special authority to guideand constrain certain federal agencies in the Northwest. The Council'splan and program are addressed to federal agencies involved in developingor regulating hydroelectric projects, not state agencies. The proposed action would not authorize the appropriation of water by anyentity or individual, affect water rights or jurisdiction over water, oralter or establish any water or water-related right. Nor would the amendmentsalter, amend, repeal, interpret, modify, or conflict with any interstatecompact made by the states. The Council would promptly and carefully consider revising protected areasif any of the states completes a comprehensive, or river basin, or watershedplan, and would acknowledge the strong state interests in resident fishand wildlife.<ITAG tagnum="84">7. River Miles and Hydropower Development Affected</ITAG>Region-wide, 40,794 river miles would be affected by the proposed amendments(less than 15% of the region's river miles). The Council estimates thatof 327 hydroelectric projects currently proposed or under study in thePacific Northwest, 202 would be affected, representing 688 average megawattsof energy, and 125 projects representing 800 average megawatts would beunaffected. <ITAG tagnum="84">8. Amendments to Protected Areas</ITAG>Under the proposal, protected areas could be amended through four processes:(1) The Council through an expedited amendment process, could remove fromthe list areas erroneously included on the List because of incorrect dataor other technical errors: (2) the Council would promptly initiate amendmentproceedings and consider revising Protected Area designations in lightof any state comprehensive rivers plans, or state river basin or watershedplans: the Council would recognize the individual states special interestin habitat for resident fish and wildlife: (3) the Council could amendthe Protected Areas designations upon completion of its system plan foranadromous fish in the Columbia River Basin: and (4) the Council wouldaccommodate other amendments to protected areas, including considerationof an exception for any hydropower project that is believed to entail exceptionalfish and wildlife benefits, through its usual amendments processes. <ITAG tagnum="6">Edward Sheets, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Executive Director. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-10051 Filed 5-5-88; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 0000-00-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
