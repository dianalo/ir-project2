 With the new low-cost Macs and the Apple IIe Card for theMac LC, the decision just got a whole lot simpler.andM;This hardware-and software-based emulator turns back the clock, changing theLC into an 8-bit Apple IIe computer.andP;  Although the Apple IIe Card is notwithout its flaws and shortcomings--particularly in hard disk drive sharingand network access--it's an amazing product nonetheless.andP;  Its very existencemight save Apple's place in the classroom and convince the hordes of Apple IIowners to leap for the higher technological ground of the Macintosh.andM;Honey, I Shrunk the IIe!andM;Stuffing an Apple IIe into the Macintosh LC is an impressive feat ofminiaturization.andP;  Not much bigger than a 3x5-inch index card, the Apple IIeCard condenses the bulky IIe motherboard to fewer than 10 chips.andP;  That lowcount and its small size makes the IIe Card both economical and functionalwithin the already crowded confines of the LC's interior.andP;  The card plugsinto the sole processor-direct slot (PDS) at the rear of the LC's circuitboard.andM;Apple says the IIe Card must be installed by an Apple dealer, but theprocedure is well within the capabilities of anyone who has shoved a boardinto an Apple II slot.andP;  The fit is close at the back, especially where theCard's port clears the LC case, but with care you won't have any trouble.andO;Connecting the only other piece of hardware, a Y-shaped cable, is evensimpler.andP;  The single end of the 6-inch cable plugs into the Apple IIe Card'sport, while the double end connects the card to Apple II-style disk drives, ajoystick, and even the venerable Muppet Keyboard, an excellent input devicethat's perfect for preschoolers.andM;Part of the IIe Card's sleight-of-hand is the way it gets the LC's internal3.5-inch SuperDrive to read Apple II disks.andP;  If you've already converted yourApple II software library to 3.5-inch disks and you don't play Apple IIgames, you can put away the Y-shaped cable.andM;However, the majority of II software, particularly older packages, comes onlyin the 5.25-inch format.andP;  Most people will want to hook at least one5.25-inch drive to the LC.andP;  That's not a problem for former Apple II owners,who are likely to have a drive handy.andP;  Make sure that the 5.25-inch drive hasa gray case--the older Disk II, UniDisk 5.25, and DuoDisk drives can't beused with the LC.andP;  You can chain up to two 5.25-inch disk drives, and evenadd a 3.5-inch UniDisk to the series, for a total of four floppy disk drivesin the Apple IIe mode.andP;  With the IIe Card in place, the case locked down, andthe drives connected, you're ready to step back into the age when the AppleII ruled.andM;The Brains of the OutfitandM;Apple II emulation on the Macintosh depends on more than just the card.andP;  Muchof the alchemy depends on Apple's emulating software.andP;  IIe Startup is a 245KMacintosh application you run from the LC while it's still in Mac mode.andP;  Youcopy it, along with its supporting IIe Prefs file, to the LC's hard disk,then double-click on the icon.andP;  The screen goes black, a logo appears, and inmoment you're looking at the white-on-black &quot;Apple IIe, Copyright AppleComputer, Inc.&quot; message that's so familiar to Apple II users.andM;This is no Macintosh window.andP;  The emulation takes complete control of the LC,although this unfortunately prevents any cut-and-paste operations betweenApple II and Macintosh software.andP;  (You can run IIe Startup under MultiFinder,but there's no benefit, since you can't get to any other MultiFinder screen.)andO;The LC has just turned itself into an Apple IIe.andM;This transformation is more than just screen-deep.andP;  Unbeknownst to you, theLC reassigns its RAM, mouse, monitor, modem port, printer port, clock, andSuperDrive as phantom IIe slots and devices.andP;  Much of what's inside theMacintosh now thinks it's part of an Apple IIe.andP;  Check this out for yourselfby pressing Ctrl-Command-Esc to pull up the Option Panel.andM;This configuration is similar to the Mac's own Control Panel interface,featuring icons, radio buttons, and the occasional scrolling selection list.andO;To match the LC's internals and ports to specific IIe-style slots, forinstance, you click on the Slots icon, then drag additional icons fromholding areas to fake slot spots.andP;  Want to &quot;pull&quot; the Super Serial card fromslot 1 and replace it with an Apple Talk interface?andP;  Simple.andP;  Just click anddrag two icons.andM;The Option Panel also lets you assign up to a megabyte of LC RAM as IIememory, change the specifics of the LC's modem and printer ports, modifymouse speed, pick any of the printers connected via Apple Talk, and more.andO;Other quick changes--from doubling the emulation speed to flipping betweenmonochrome and color displays to resetting key repeats and delays--arecarried out here, too.andM;Apple has even tossed in a couple of extras.andP;  With the IIe Card and itssoftware activated, you can snapshot Apple II screens as easily as youcapture screens on a Macintosh.andP;  The screens are saved to disk as PICT files,which you can open and print from almost any Mac graphics program.andP;  And youcan change the distinctive Apple II-style beep to any sound currentlyavailable in the LC's Control Panel.andP;  Combine the flexibility of the IIeStartup software and the Apple IIe Card's ease of installation and you haveemulation that's second to none.andM;Apple II Forever?andM;The proof of the success of this kind of computer mimicry is, of course,easily proven in practice.andP;  The Apple IIe Card/Macintosh LC combinationconfidently performs as a pseudo Apple IIe, handling all the major and mostcommonly used Apple II software.andP;  With some exceptions, Apple II 8-bitprograms run, display, and print just as they would on an actual Apple IIe.andO;A real highlight of the Apple IIe Card is its ability to run II software attwice the speed of a real Apple IIe (though still only 66 percent as fast asthe Apple IIGS runs 8-bit programs).andP;  Databases sort, screens refresh, andgames play faster.andM;AppleWorks, easily the most popular Apple II application, performedflawlessly, even printing to a PostScript printer networked to a Mac LC withApple Talk.andP;  One of the few Apple II programs that can take advantage of RAMabove the 128K mark, AppleWorks recognized and utilized the entire megabytechanneled from the LC.andP;  Other titles--both veterans like Print Shop andPublish It, and relative newcomers like Where in Europe is Carmen Sandiegoand BannerMania--worked nearly as well.andM;However, Publish It!, one of the few troublemakers, refused to print throughthe LC's Apple Talk connection.andP;  Another problem package was America Online,the telecommunications service that has a robust Apple II section.andP;  Theservice's proprietary communications software simply couldn't find the LC'smodem port, no matter what its settings.andM;The IIe Card does lack some important features.andP;  It cannot share the LC'sinternal hard disk drive (nor any hard disk connected to the computer's SCSIport).andP;  Forced to use floppies only, experienced Apple II users may notimmediately notice the drop in productivity, but once you spend time workingwith the LC in Macintosh mode, you'll wish you had faster, larger storage forthe IIe, also.andM;Critical to the IIe Card's success in educational circles is a fix to anotherproblem: You can't access an Apple Talk network, its peripherals (except forits printers), or its AppleShare-driven file server from within the emulatedApple IIe mode.andP;  Schools often use AppleTalk to run AppleShare-aware 8-bitprograms like AppleWorks and a slew of educational software.andP;  That'simpossible with the current version of the IIe Card's software, althoughApple says it is working hard on adding networking to the emulation.andM;Though the Apple IIe Card doesn't do everything Apple II owners would like,it's clearly the best way to hang on to an 8-bit software investment whilemoving on to a more promising platform.andP;  Other emulations, particularly IBM'sApple board, force you to translate files before using them inside anothermachine.andP;  The IIe Card offers a transparent and nearly complete way to doublethe number of computers on your desktop without taking up another square inchof space.andM;Gregg Keizer is a Louisiana-based freelance writer who writes for science,technology, computer, and electronic entertainment publications.andP;
