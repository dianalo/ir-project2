Troops banned Moslems from weekly prayers in troubled southerncities in an attempt to prevent more unrest, which has killed eightpeople.   King Hussein, visiting Washington, canceled a trip to Britainscheduled to begin Saturday and planned to return to Jordan, theJordanian Embassy in London said.   In Salt, a city of 100,000 12 miles north of Amman, childrenplayed inside shattered offices and hundreds of people milledaround on the glass-strewn streets.   Demonstrators called for the ouster of Prime Minister ZaidRifai, whom they blame for austerity measures and declining livingstandards. They shouted support for Hussein.   ``We are fed up with this government. They have stolen all ourmoney,'' said a man in his 60s who refused to give his name. Hesaid demonstrators ``trust the king's leadership and we know hewill respond.''   Riots also occurred Thursday night in the northern towns ofMadaba and Tayyba.   It was the first time disturbances had spread beyond the southsince the unrest began Tuesday in the southern city of Maan. Thedemonstrations came in response to price increases of 10 percent to50 percent on gasoline, cigarettes, heating oil and othercommodities.   The increases were imposed Sunday as part of an agreement withthe International Monetary Fund to reschedule Jordan's $6 billionforeign debt. They came on top of rising unemployment and soaringinflation.   Residents of Maan and other southern cities said soldiersprevented people from attending Friday prayers at mosques.Cancellation of Friday prayers is highly unusual in an Islamiccountry.   The Koran, Islam's holy book, calls on Moslems to participate inthe ceremony, and most take it as a binding duty.   Government officials earlier had hinted that Moslemfundamentalists had inflamed the unrest, the worst domesticviolence since the 1970-71 war between the army and PalestineLiberation Organization guerrillas.   Most of the rioting has involved native Jordanians, not thePalestinian half of the population.   An official statement read on state-run radio said fourcivilians and one policeman had died in Maan, and it blamed thedeaths on ``shootings by the rioters.''   Residents of the city earlier had blamed the civilian deaths onthe army, although they said rioters also were firing weapons.   Three other people were reported killed in Mazar, 55 miles southof Amman.   State-run Jordan Television broadcast an appeal to JordaniansFriday night to end the violence, for the first time showingpictures of smashed buildings and destroyed vehicles.   ``These are the services which the government tried to providefor the whole country and we paid with our tears and with our sweatand with our blood to have them built,'' said Mohammed Amin, theJordan Television director who narrated the 20-minute program.   ``These were destroyed by a bunch of terrorists.''   He said because of the damage, ``We will not pass this stage (ofeconomic difficulty) as quickly as we thought because now we haveadded pressure.''   Israeli radio and TV were reporting the difficulties ``toinstigate problems,'' he said, and ``news agencies are exaggeratingthe picture of the situation.''   About 1,000 people demonstrated Thursday night in Tayyba, a town40 miles northwest of Amman.   Mayor Mahmoud Awneh said rioters smashed windows in a school andthe town hall. He denounced the riot, but also criticized the pricerises.   ``They shouldn't have raised the prices so much.'' He said.``They should have increased them slowly ... When you do it 50percent, the people can't afford it.''   Relatives of Communist Party members said government agentsarrested about 100 party members overnight after the partydistributed a leaflet demanding the government scrap the pricerises and cancel its austerity plan.   The government, as is common, made no report of the arrests.</TEXT></DOC>
