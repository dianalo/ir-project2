The federal jury that convicted five officials of Princeton/Newport and a former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. trader on Monday began considering the government's forfeiture request yesterday.    The six defendants were convicted on all but one of 64 felony counts involving a variety of acts of conspiracy, racketeering, and securities, wire and mail fraud. Two of those counts related to charges stemming from the potent Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, or RICO.    The RICO law requires convicted defendants to forfeit their profits from the alleged wrongdoing, plus interest, as well as their salaries during the period of wrongdoing and their stake in what the law calls a &quot;racketeering enterprise.&quot;    The government had alleged that the illgotten gains in this case totaled about $445,000, and prosecutors succeeded prior to trial in tying up a total of $21.7 million in assets for all of the defendants. Under RICO, assets can be restrained prior to trial to preserve them in the event of a conviction and subsequent forfeiture.    The assets tied up prior to trial include interests in Princeton/Newport partnerships held by James Sutton Regan, the managing general partner of Princeton/Newport, and Jack Z. Rabinowitz, Charles M. Zarzecki and Paul A. Berkman, all of whom were general partners of the investment firm.    The assets also include the compensation of those partners between July 1984 and February 1986, when the crimes for which they were convicted occurred. Additionally, compensation for Steven B. Smotrich, a defendant who was Princeton/Newport's comptroller and Bruce L. Newberg, a former Drexel junk bond trader during that time period, is included among the assets that have been sought by the government.    U.S. District Judge Robert L. Carter told a jury of nine women and three men yesterday that if the panel finds that the Princeton/Newport officials, including Mr. Smotrich, held any interest in the Princeton/Newport &quot;enterprise&quot; through which illegal trading occurred, it could require defendants to forfeit that entire interest.    Judge Carter told jurors they could also require the defendants to forfeit any compensation they may have obtained as a result of the racketeering violations for which they were convicted.    Mr. Regan has the most at stake, with a total of $15.1 million in partnership interests and compensation that could be forfeitable. Mr. Rabinowitz has $1.4 million at risk. Mr. Berkman has $1.3 million.    Since Mr. Smotrich and Mr. Newberg didn't have any interest in the Princeton/Newport enterprise, Judge Carter ruled that the jury could determine that they must forfeit all or part of their compensation for the period in which the violations occurred. Mr. Smotrich's compensation during that period was $124,500; Mr. Newberg's was $2.6 million.    Over objections by defense attorneys, Judge Carter also allowed prosecutors to introduce as evidence parts of the government's document that listed its charges -- known as a criminal &quot;information&quot; -- against Drexel. These are the charges to which Drexel agreed to plead guilty in December, rather than face racketeering charges of its own.    One of the six counts to which Drexel pleaded guilty, which related to a transaction with Princeton/Newport, was given to jurors to consider in their deliberations about the amount Mr. Newberg must forfeit. Jurors were also told that Drexel had agreed to pay a &quot;substantial sum&quot; to the government as a penalty, but it wasn't told that Drexel paid $650 million in fines and restitution.    Defense lawyers told jurors yesterday that to require defendants who had already been convicted on so many felony counts to forfeit all their remaining assets would constitute &quot;cruel and unusual punishment,&quot; in violation of the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.    &quot;The results of your verdict are devastating, and they have destroyed the lives of our clients,&quot; Paul Grand, a lawyer for Mr. Zarzecki, told jurors. &quot;If you order the forfeitures the government has requested, it would be vengeful,&quot; he said.    &quot;The Eighth Amendment says the punishment must fit the crime,&quot; said Jack Arsenault, Mr. Berkman's lawyer. &quot;This is now the excess of government the Eighth Amendment was designed to protect us from.&quot;    But Mark Hansen, a prosecutor in the case, told jurors that the law provides for defendants to be stripped of their interests in a tainted enterprise. The crimes these defendants committed, he said, &quot;were in their economic self-interest,&quot; and they should be severely punished for them. </TEXT></DOC>
