A word of advice:unfair trading practices are an unfair condemnation of afriendly ally.   The Japan-bashers' arguments against Japan's supposedtrade perfidy have undergone a series of self-interestedmetamorphoses. The original complaint was that Japan'svisible trade barriers were much higher than ours. When itbecame apparent that this was not so, the criticism shiftedto the charge that the Ministry of International Trade andIndustry somehow was managing to prevent the lower tradebarriers from increasing imports. Empirical scrutiny failedto sustain this charge too.</LP><TEXT>   Now the argument has shifted again. The current charge isthat the problem is not the efficacy of MITI's visible(import-restraining) hand but the inefficacy of Adam Smith'sinvisible (import-enhancing) hand. In short, Japan is toobizarre and exotic, in its culture and in its economicorganization, for markets (and therefore GATT-style marketaccess) to work as they do in the West.   The culturalists have had a field day with this view. Buttheir assertions of Japan's cultural uniqueness and hownormal &quot;rules-based&quot; trade with Japan is impossible, don'thold up under economic scrutiny. As is often the case,economics can explain differences glibly attributed toculture. A few examples should suffice:   Take the popular view that Japan's familial culture leadsto the &quot;permanent-employment&quot; system. Few know that thissystem came to Japan only after the Second World War. Indeed,as argued recently by Columbia Prof. Jacob Mincer, the laborturnover rates in Japanese manufacturing before the war andin American manufacturing since the war are broadly similar.It wasn't until after the war that the decline in employeeturnover in Japan occurred. The explanation seems to be thatthe rapid economic growth in post-war Japan was based onrapid technical change that called for intensive formation ofhuman capital specific to an enterprise. This encouragedlower turnover.   Or take the frequent complaint that the Japanese arewedded to their own for supplies of intermediates. Evidence?In the U.S., Japanese companies' ratio of importedintermediates to value added is twice as high as that ofother foreign investors. But think again. If protection, orthe threat of it, induces foreign firms to enter a market,they will typically import as many components as they canfrom their home base, where production is cheaper. Who candeny that our actual and threatened trade restraints againstJapan have been substantially greater than those againstother nations? The astonishing thing may well be thatJapanese investors have not wound up showing a yet higherratio of imports to value added.   James Fallows of the Atlantic Monthly writes about Japan'sinability to play by &quot;rules,&quot; and its preference for&quot;quantities.&quot; These cultural abnormalities make it impossiblefor Japan to have rules-based, GATT-type trade and makes&quot;managed trade&quot; (with specified quantities traded) the bestsolution. Japanese trade negotiators presumably ask the U.S.:How much do you want us to import? Mr. Fallows attributesthis query to &quot;Japanese discomfort with the very prospect ofabiding by abstract principles.&quot; This is nonsense. Is it notmore likely that, faced with Americans' repeated complaints,the Japanese ask: &quot;How much do you want us to import,&quot; wiselymuting the rest of the sentence: &quot;to get you off our backs?&quot;Since the 1930s, the U.S. has imposed quantitative limits onJapan's successful exports, starting with &quot;voluntary&quot; exportrestraints on electric lamps and textiles. Could not theJapanese have learned, thanks to us, the wisdom of askingabout quantities?   Clyde Prestowitz, former U.S. trade negotiator and an allyof Mr. Fallows in the angst over Japan, is doubly wrong whenhe asserts that Japan &quot;plays a different game&quot; and thattherefore the U.S. cannot have beneficial trade with it undera rules-based multilateral trading regime. For one thing, thesports analogy is inappropriate: In games, one party losesand the other wins; in trade, both often win. His seconderror, shared by other culturalists, is to exaggerate theexotic nature of the Japanese game. In his incomprehension,he's like the Indian maharajah who, taken to a polo match,turned to his English host in puzzled consternation to say:&quot;It is so sad to see them fighting over that ball. Why don'tyou give each their own?&quot;   What then about the view, often ascribed to ChalmersJohnson, professor at the University of California at SanDiego, that Japanese companies believe in &quot;predatory&quot;competition?   The notion that American companies, by contrast, competein a benign fashion is faintly romantic and fully foolish.What the Cambridge economist Joan Robinson used to call the&quot;animal spirits&quot; of capitalist entrepreneurs surely aremanifest in both countries. The successful always appear morepredatory. This was exactly the stereotype of Britishentrepreneurs during the 19th century and of the &quot;ugly&quot;American in the '50s and '60s. With success, one gets one'sshare of envy and resentment.   The hawks in Congress would like to hit Japan again thisyear with Super 301, seeing Japan's latest concessions at theStructural Impediments Initiative talks as a defendant'sadmission of guilt. But these concessions are nothing of thekind. Most, such as the promise of more infrastructurespending, have little relationship to trade; none can be asubstitute for our own actions in improving our tradedeficit.   Rather, the concessions are designed to cap theincreasingly strident Japan-bashing from getting altogetherout of hand. They give the administration a sporting chanceto face down a bellicose Congress by citing Japan's agreeableaccommodation of our needs. The president should seize thatchance.   ---   Mr. Bhagwati is a professor of economics at Columbia.</TEXT></DOC>
