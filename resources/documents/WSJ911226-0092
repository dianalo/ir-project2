Whatever the weapon, witnesses agreethat an angry Iraqi soldier fired at a portrait of SaddamHussein, igniting a bonfire that almost toppled the Baghdadregime.   At its height, the Shiite revolt that followed SaddamHussein's retreat from Kuwait reached the suburbs of Baghdad.At its end, thousands lay dead, hundreds of thousands hadbecome refugees, and much of southern Iraq was in ruins.</LP><TEXT>   While the revolt that later erupted in Kurdistan, in thenorthern part of the country, was captured on Westerntelevision, the much bloodier fate of Shiite Muslims inIraq's south is only now coming fully to light. This accountcomes from witnesses and relief officials in Iraq, videotapesof the uprising smuggled to Iran, and human rights groups inLondon and New York.                                                                                                          March 1. Iraqi troops straggle home, fresh from their routin Kuwait. In Basra, they find central authority severelyweakened by the war. Some soldiers sell or trade their gunsfor food. Others gather at the governor's office, hoping forfood and transport to Baghdad. When no aid arrives, thesoldier fires his fateful shot and the crowd explodes,looting warehouses, burning state offices and killing anyofficial in sight.   On the same day, violence flares in nearby cities, withsoldiers and civilians melding into angry mobs. Soldiers whorefuse to surrender their arms or join the revolt are shot.Officials are dragged through the streets, burned, cut withknives, hanged. A few Iraqi units fight back, but mostsurrender or flee.                                                                                                          March 2-3. News of the revolt spreads fast on Western andIranian radio, and by word of mouth. Some 5,000 members ofthe Badr Brigade, a small army of Iraqi exiles and prisonersof war, infiltrate from Iran. In An Najaf, the center ofShiite learning in Iraq, rumors circulate that at 3 p.m. onMarch 3, the uprising will begin near the central mosque. Oncue, crowds rampage through the streets, with a dozen armedmen shouting &quot;God is Great&quot; and seizing the mosque. &quot;Atfirst, we were a little crazy,&quot; recalls one man. &quot;We believedeven the traffic lights represented Saddam Hussein so wewrecked them.&quot; Videotape from An Najaf and Karbala showsburning tanks and dazed citizens embracing in the streets.                                                                                                          March 4-10. The revolt fans across southern Iraq, oftenbloody but also oddly festive. In a village near As Samawah,rebels seize a local artist who made his living paintingportraits of Saddam Hussein. The man begs for mercy, assumingthe rebels will kill him. Instead, they fine him 50 dinarsand make him say that Saddam Hussein is the &quot;son of a dog.&quot;In An Najaf, giddy rumors circulate that Shiites will meet upwith Kurds in Baghdad, and also with Vice President Quayle.   What began as a spontaneous outburst of rage quickly takeson an organized, Islamic cast. Many rebels call themselvesmujahadeen, or holy warriors; videotapes show them wearinggreen Islamic headbands and distributing pictures of Ali, a7th century Shiite martyr. In Karbala, citizens can only buygas if they have a letter from a sayid, or descendant of Ali.In An Najaf, clerics take command and use the mosqueloudspeaker to call for food, medicine and men who know howto use captured arms. A newspaper called Islamic Republiceven appears, filled with Koranic passages and news of therevolt.   The most militant rebels chant slogans such as &quot;No toSaddam, No to America,&quot; and &quot;Kill the Betrayers of Islam.&quot; Insome cities, surrendering soldiers are executed. In Karbala,rebels hang officials in Saddam Hussein hall, an anteroom ofthe central mosque.   But for many Iraqis, Shiism is the vehicle, rather thanthe source, for their revolt. &quot;We expressed ourselves throughShiism because Saddam has stolen every other symbol for us,&quot;says a doctor from Karbala. &quot;But the revolt was about foodand freedom, not religion.&quot;   At its peak, the rebels take Al Hillah, an hour fromBaghdad, and rioting erupts in Saddam City, a Shiite suburbof the capital. Soldiers disperse the crowd, killing andwounding about 100. Fearing that the Shiite revolt willincite Kurds, authorities in Duhok Province in northern Iraqissue orders that in the event of protests, &quot;firearms forceto be used under central commanders, instructions to kill 95%of them, leaving the remainder for interrogation.&quot;                                                                                                          March 10-15. Loyalist units begin retaking the south.Allied intelligence picks up messages from Baghdad urgingcommanders in An Najaf and Karbala to &quot;use the liquids,&quot; anapparent reference to poison gas. In An Najaf, helicoptershover over the city, ordering citizens to leave on foottoward Karbala: &quot;Anyone remaining is with the criminals.Chemicals will be used.&quot; Fleeing civilians are strafed andbulldozed into mass graves. Videotape from hospitals in Iran,and the testimony of U.S. Army personnel at the Iraq-Kuwaitborder, reveal that many refugees have napalm burns.   In Karbala, 400 rebels stage a last-ditch defense, turningone of Shiite Islam's holiest mosques into the rebellion'sAlamo. The army shells the shrine and fires tank shellsthrough the door, leaving a wrecked and corpse-ridden mosquestrung with nooses and stained with bloody handprints.                                                                                                          March 15-30. Iraqi security takes its revenge. In andaround Karbala and An Najaf, neighborhoods, palm groves andparts of cemeteries are leveled to deny cover to fugitives.In Al Musayib, soldiers carry off 5,000 men, never to return.In Basra's central square, the army douses rebels withgasoline and burns them alive. Leaders are left hanging inpublic for days. Relief officials say 30,000 or more peoplemay have died in the civil war.   In late March, Baghdad TV broadcasts the &quot;confessions&quot; ofShiite rebels, who blame the revolt on Iran. Southern tribalsheiks trek to Baghdad to praise Saddam Hussein and to begforgiveness for the acts of &quot;criminals&quot; in their districts.   Workmen begin regilding Shiite mosques' shattered domes&quot;upon directives from President Saddam Hussein.&quot; And in thevillage near As Samawah, the local artist begins freshportraits of Saddam Hussein, to replace those ripped down inthe rebellion.</TEXT></DOC>
