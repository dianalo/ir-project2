Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis called the moves``irrational'' and ``irresponsible'' on ground that communitiessurrounding the New England plants cannot be quickly evacuated incase of a nuclear accident.   The former Democratic presidential nominee immediately filed suitin federal appeals court in Boston in an effort to block the restartof Pilgrim. And the governor reiterated his pledge to fight aSeabrook license in court if one is issued.   NRC Chairman Lando W. Zech Jr. said Seabrook could get itslow-power license, which permits testing at 5 percent power, asearly as Jan. 6 if it can set aside $72.1 million. The NRC said theowners must have that money on hand for decommissioning costs incase Seabrook receives the testing permit but never gets afull-power commercial license.   Seabrook also cannot receive the license, which it has sought formore than two years, until the Atomic Safety and Licensing Boardrules on a request by Massachusetts officials to review allegedproblems with the operators' response during a June exercise of theplant's emergency plans.   But Seabrook officials said the commission's staff has alreadyrecommended that the licensing board reject the state's request andthat they expected the issue to be resolved shortly.   Ted G. Feigenbaum, vice president at New Hampshire Yankee,operator of the plant, also said that while Seabrook officialsestimated possible decommissioning costs at $21.1 million, he didnot view the larger fund demanded by the NRC as a stumbling block.He predicted low-power testing would be under way next month.   The NRC also rejected unanimously an appeal by opponents toreview the financial qualifications of Seabrook's owners. Theplant's lead owner, Public Service Company of New Hampshire, filedfor bankruptcy reorganization in January. In June, the project'sfourth largest shareholder, the Massachusetts Municipal WholesaleElectric Co., withdrew from the project and halted its $2 millionmonthly payments.   In Boston, Dukakis said that ``In the case of Seabrook, it isunconscionable that the NRC continues to discuss ways to advancelow-power testing, because it is impossible to adequately evacuatethe area.''   The vote to restart the Pilgrim plant, which was shut down inApril 1986 because of several management and safety problems, alsowas unanimous.   Zech said the commission was convinced that an estimated $35million in safety improvements and a sweeping management overhaul byBoston Edison Co. has made the 16-year-old plant ready to resumeoperations.   But Dukakis leads a legion of critics who point to a 1987 reportby the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which found that theplans to evacuate suburban residents around Pilgrim were inadequate.The plant is 40 miles south of Boston in Plymouth, Mass.   ``Today's vote is an insult to the local officials and SouthShore residents who have shown convincingly that no emergencyevacuation plan can safely protect the public,'' said Sen. Edward M.Kennedy, D-Mass. ``The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has againdemonstrated its disregard for public safety.''   Zech, speaking to reporters after the brief votes, said ``greatimprovements'' have been made on the emergency evacuation plans.   ``The commission has acted in a very difficult situation. I thinkwe have acted appropriately ... we are the one responsible fordeciding whether or not the public will be protected in the remotepossibility of a radiological accident,'' he said.   Zech said Pilgrim officials will resume operations slowly, andthat NRC investigators must approve operations at each of six levelsof power.   Pilgrim officials said they expected the restart to take fourmonths, beginning before Jan. 1.   The state's lawsuit calls the NRC action on Pilgrim ``arbitraryand capricious'' and urges an immediate injunction to halt the plantfrom getting up to 25 percent power.   Meanwhile, Zech said the commission will not rule until next yearon whether the state and local governments in New York have legalstanding in the licensing procedure for the Shoreham nuclear planton Long Island, under fire for reasons similar to those cited bycritics of Seabrook.</TEXT></DOC>
