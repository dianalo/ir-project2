Baker III will meet in Rome thisweekend with South African Foreign Minister Roelof Botha, the StateDepartment said Wednesday.   The meeting is part of an expansion of contacts planned by Bushadministration officials with leading South Africans both in andout of government.   A senior U.S. official, asking not to be identified, said themood between the two countries has improved partly as a result ofthe U.S.-mediated agreement last December under which Cuba agreedto the phased withdrawal of its forces from Angola and South Africaconsented to end its colonial role in Namibia.   ``There is a greater atmosphere of confidence,'' the officialsaid.   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler disclosed thatBaker will meet with Botha during a stopover in Rome prior toattending the NATO summit meeting in Brussels.   Last week, President Bush met with three anti-apartheidactivists, including Nobel Peace Prize winner Archbishop DesmondTutu. The administration also is planning to invite the leader ofSouth Africa's ruling National Party, F. W. de Klerk. Regularmeetings also are planned with representatives of the country'smain anti-apartheid group, the African National Congress.   The new assistant secretary for African affairs, Herman Cohen,hopes to visit South Africa within the next two months.   The goal of the intensified U.S. diplomacy is to determinewhether the United States can help promote meaningful discussionsamong South Africans toward the establishment of a system that willgive the majority black population political rights for the firsttime.   ``To the extent that the two sides can get together on aframework, so much the better,'' a U.S. official said.   He added that the December agreement negotiated by Cohen'spredecessor, Chester Crocker, is progressing well, with theindependence process in Namibia moving ahead and the Cuban troopwithdrawal being carried out on schedule.   There are also inconclusive signs that Angola's Marxistgovernment may be interested for the first time in negotiating anend to the 14-year civil war with U.S.-backed rebels.   U.S.-South African relations were set back sharply by theeconomic sanctions Congress imposed in 1986 and officialsacknowledged that the relationship is still ``traumatized'' by thataction.   President Reagan vetoed the sanctions but was overridden byCongress.</TEXT></DOC>
