(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Wall Street credit rating firm suspendedthe city's bond rating Thursday, crippling the city's borrowingpower on the third day of fines imposed when City Council rejecteda housing desegregation plan.   ``We can't borrow money,'' interim City Manager Neil DeLuca saidafter Moody's Investors Service Inc. suspended its rating ofYonkers' bonds. ``No corporation can function without the abilityto borrow money.''   A federal judge began fining the city Tuesday after City Councilfailed to support his plan to build low- and middle income housingto remedy housing and school segregation.   The fines began at $100 on Tuesday and double each day.   In a statement, Moody's said the suspension was ``due touncertainties resulting from daily fines imposed by the federalcourt. Those uncertainties derive foremost from the potential forextraordinary disruption of operations.''   Moody's said the fine schedule would deplete the city's reportedAug. 3 cash reserve of $66.3 million by Aug. 22.   Another credit rating firm, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. said it wasmonitoring the situation Thursday and took no action on itsYonkers' rating.   Yonkers, the state's fourth-largest municipality with apopulation of nearly 200,000, has been in a legal tug-of-war withU.S. District Judge Leonard Sand since 1985, when he found the cityliable for intentionally segregating housing and schools during a40-year period. Yonkers is just north of New York City.   City Council on Monday voted 4-3 against endorsing a package ofbonuses, financial incentives and zoning variances to attractdevelopers to build the housing.   ``Everybody seems to be doing the same thing, waiting for theother guy to move,'' DeLuca said. ``The judge, the council, thegovernor, the control board. ... We can't get the City Council tochange its vote and we can't get the judge to change his ruling andwe're going bankrupt.''   The judge has suggested that Gov. Mario Cuomo step in to helpresolve the crisis, either by removing the four councilmen whovoted against the judge's plan or through the state-run EmergencyFinancial Control Board, which oversees city spending. The fourcouncilmen are paying daily fines of $500.   The control board, however, postponed a meeting slated forThursday and Cuomo said he was reluctant to get involved.   The governor said, ``I'm not going to allow any damage to occurthat I can prevent.'' But he told New York radio station WCBS-AMthat action ``has to be taken by the City Council in the firstplace. ... These people were elected.''   He said it was ``not the best way to deal with these matters tohave the power come down from the state Capitol to throw an electedofficial out of office. ... I don't like disrupting the system.''   The city has asked the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals toblock the contempt finding and the fines while it appeals thejudge's action.   Secretary of State Gail Shaffer, urging the city council to meetbefore Tuesday and get the city out of contempt, outlined possibleactions the control board can take should the city fail to act.   Those actions include imposition of a wage and hiring freeze, ahalt of discretionary spending and, finally, taking overdisbursement of all city funds, she said in a letter to the council.   By Tuesday's meeting, the aggregate fines will total $25,500,she said.</TEXT></DOC>
