Our original motivation for this workwas to model the grain boundaries in iron. The version of the EAM wehave used is where the total energy is given as the sum of two body termssummed over pairs of atoms i,j, together with an embedding term givenby the sum of embedding functions whose arguments are the total electroniccharge density at the sites i. A Morse potential with the three parametersv{sub 1}, v{sub 2} and v{sub 3}, is used to represent the two-body terms.The total electronic charge densities at each individual site which arethe arguments of the embedding functions, are obtained from the linearsuperposition of atomic 4s Slater function charge densities of form.The fifth parameter v{sub 5} is taken as the cutoff distance for theatomic charge densities and for phi(r{sub ij}), which are adjusted forsmoothness at cutoff. The embedding function itself is determined bythe fit of the cohesive energy of bcc iron as a function of interatomicdistance to the ``universal'' cohesive energy function described by Roseet al. 15 refs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
