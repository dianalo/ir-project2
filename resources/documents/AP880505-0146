Fifteen of the dead were Melanesian separatists holding thecaptives, and two were rescuers, said Bernard Pons, France'sminister for overseas territories.   The team pelted the cave with tear gas canisters, forcing mostof the estimated 30 captors out, Pons told reporters in thecapital, Noumea. A ``particularly violent battle'' ensued, he said.   Three members of the assault team and three captors were injuredin the nearly seven-hour battle in the thick underbrush of Ouveaisland in the Loyalty island group, he said.   The hostages _ 22 gendarmes and an assistant prosecutor _ wereseized in two groups on April 22 and April 27 by Melanesianseparatists seeking independence for the island and protestingFrench-dominated regional elections April 24.   The hostages freed their manacled hands with a key that had beensneaked in earlier and defended themselves with two pistols alsoobtained before the attack, Pons said.   ``Taking advantage of the smoke created by tear gas bombs, thehostages were able to escape through a chimney in the back of thecave,'' he said.   The key and pistols had been smuggled in by Capt. PhilippeLegorjus, a hostage who at one point acted as intermediary, leavingthe cave for talks with French government officials.   During the negotiations, the kidnappers told Legorjus the otherhostages would be killed if he did not return to the cave.   ``The situation inside the cave had become extremelydangerous,'' Defense Minister Andre Giraud said in Paris. ``In anycase, it was entirely intolerable that representatives of theforces of order might be held hostage.''   The rescue operation was carried out by an elite gendarmessquad, paratroopers, a marine commando unit and a special actionunit of the French counter-espionage agency, military officialssaid.   The Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front, the mainMelanesian separatist organization, called for a mobilization toprotest the assault, which it called ``colonial barbary.''   ``This will not stop the determination of the Kanak people intheir demand for independence,'' Jean-Marie Tjibaou, the frontpresident, told The Associated Press by telephone from his home inHienghene at the northern end of the main island.   Premier Jacques Chirac said the operation was ``infinitelydifficult'' given the rough terrain on Ouvea and the almostinaccessable location of the cave. The cave is at the bottom of a50-yard-by-30-yard crater.   He said it was decided on after ``friendly attempts'' to freethe hostages failed.   Chirac called on Caledonians to ``work together for mutualunderstanding, dialogue and a peaceful solution to the problems ofNew Caledonia.   ``This French territory has clearly spoken about its wish toremain French,'' he said in apparent reference to the elections.The front boycotted the voting, in which pro-French settlersdominated.   The separatists took captive 27 gendarmes, police under militaryorders, in an attack on a police station April 22 in which fourgendarmes were hacked to death.   Eleven were freed three days later. But on April 27, sevengendarmes and the assistant prosecutor were captured when they wentto the hideout for negotiations. A sick hostage also was freed thatday.   Besides cancelling regional elections, the militants weredemanding that hundreds of French troops be removed from Ouvea andthat a mediator be sent to discuss independence for thearchipelago, a French territory since 1853.   Forty-three percent of the territory's 145,000 inhabitants arenative Melanesians, most of whom want independence. Europeansettlers make up 36 percent of the population, with the rest Asianand Polynesian.   Interior Minister Charles Pasqua, speaking on television,defended the decision to take action, saying, ``You don't make anomelette without breaking eggs.''   Pasqua said he did not know if Chirac decided on the assaultbefore or after news of the release of three French hostages inLebanon.   Jean-Marie Le Pen, of the extreme right National Front, praisedthe operation and implied that similar tactics should have beenused in Lebanon.   ``There is only one way to deal with terrorists, that used inOuvea,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
