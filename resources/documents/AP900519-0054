The new group, the Center Alliance, was formed by a close Walesaadvisor and favors speeding up economic and political reform.   It also wants Poland's current president, former Communist Partychief Wojciech Jaruzelski, to step aside.   The Solidarity government has launched an ambitioustop-to-bottom overhaul of the socialist economic system. But Walesahas pressed for an even faster expunging of the former government'spersonnel and policies.   ``The acceleration we are proposing is to do away with theremnants of the old system,'' Sen. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who isspearheading the new alliance, said Friday. Kaczynski is editor ofthe weekly Tygodnik Solidarnosc and a member of Walesa's innercircle.   The alliance has issued a founding declaration, but it is not aformal political party.   The split over the pace of reforms goes back to the April 1989accord signed by then-Communist authorities and Solidarity. Itpaved the way for democratic parliamentary elections that led tothe takeover of the government by Solidarity.   But under the accord, parliament seats were guaranteed to thesubsequently dissolved Communist Party, the interior and defenseministers were retained from the former government, and Jaruzelskiwas installed as president to smooth the transition and helpmaintain relations with the Soviet Union.   With the democratization elsewhere in Eastern Europe in recentmonths, some say the accord is out of date.   ``The round-table agreement cannot be binding any longer,''Kaczynski said. ``Jaruzelski should come to the conclusion that hismission is concluded.''   Jaruzelski's presidential term lasts until 1995, and fully freeparliamentary voting is not scheduled until 1993. But there ispressure from many quarters to speed up the timetable, possibly aspart of a rewriting of the Polish Constitution.   Walesa has fueled the debate with his interest in the presidencyand his criticism, recently more strident, of the government ofPrime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a former Solidarity leaderhimself. Kaczynski said his declaration of support for Walesa isnot a move against Mazowiecki.   ``It is true that there is some argument about whether we shouldcontinue in small steps or make quick, radical changes. It is truethat we differ in our assessment of the situation. But...we don'twant to remove Mazowiecki,'' he said.   Kaczynski said Walesa supports his group, but that the alliancewill not dissolve if he rejects its suggestion that he run forpresident.   ``Our main goal is capitalism,'' Kaczynski said.</TEXT></DOC>
