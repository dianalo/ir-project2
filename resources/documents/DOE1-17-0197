If such a disturbance can induce cooler, denser gas co-existingwith the hot phase to form observable stars at a rate comparable to theinferred mass-deposition rates in these galaxies, the newly-formed starswill be created with the appropriate phase-space characteristics forthe phase-wrapping mechanism invoked in the context of the merger hypothesisto occur. Thus a system of optical shells with the observed wide rangeof binding energies can be produced from a single disturbance havinga wide variety of possible energies and epochs.</TEXT></DOC>
