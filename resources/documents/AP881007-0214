On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the November contract forWest Texas Intermediate rose 6 cents to settle at $12.66 a barrelon Thursday, but other contract months settled as much as 15 centslower. The near-term contract had been up as much as 30 centsduring the session.   Among refined products traded on the exchange, the Novembercontract for wholesale unleaded gasoline rose .06 cent to settle at39.50 cents a gallon, while home heating oil slipped 0.52 cent to37.24 cents a gallon. Other contract months finished lower.   Traders said a technical rally gripped the market, pushingprices higher by midday, but broke down shortly thereafter on adearth of encouraging news.   ``The market still looks sick,'' said Chris McCormack, a traderat Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. He said participants were continuingto focus on Saudi Arabia's production levels.   Earlier this week Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oilexporter, threatened not to restrain its own production if othermembers of the 13-nation OPEC cartel continued to pump beyond theirquotas.   ``That's old news, but it's still the focus of the market, andthere's a feeling that Saudi Arabia has not yet achieved its goalsand will continue to pressure prices,'' McCormack said.   The Saudis have indicated they want to punish other members ofthe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries for overproducingand driving down the price of oil.   Traders also remained concerned about a report that surfacedWednesday that said Exxon Corp. chartered a number of tankers totransport a substantial amount of oil out of the Persian Gulf,presumably from Saudi Arabia.   The market interpreted the report as further ``confirmation thatSaudi Arabia has increased production,'' said Andrew Lebow, atrader at E.D.andamp; F. Man International Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
