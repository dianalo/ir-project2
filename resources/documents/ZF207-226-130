GrossmanandM;Although cutting-edge workstations lack the next-generation applicationsneeded to firmly ensconce them on the corporate desktop, the machines'sophisticated development tools and user interfaces give corporateprogrammers the ability to create their own applications now, industryobservers say.andM;Unix-based workstations from vendors such as NeXT Inc., Sun Microsystems Inc.andO;and Digital Equipment Corp. offer several tools to build sophisticatedapplications such as graphical windowing systems, Structured Query Languagedatabases and integrated networking.andM;''A lot of work originally is going to be done in-house, but with thesetools, the work becomes much easier,'' said Steven Levey, vice president ofPutnam Management Co., a Boston-based money-management firm.andP;  Levey iscurrently working on several software systems to help integrate ticker data,client information and portfolio management.andM;NextStep, Open Windows, Macintosh Finder and other user interfaces could be akey factor in convincing business users to buy workstations.andP;  Combined withpowerful development tools, these user interfaces will provide a simple,graphical set of controls for a variety of custom applications, such astrader-analysis systems for Wall Street firms or executive informationsystems keyed to mainframe databases, observers say.andM;''The major application on these machines is an integrated, consistent,graphical applications environment,'' said Mark Stahlman, a research analystwith Sanford C. Bernstein Inc. in New York.andP;  ''This is not .andP;  .  .  abusiness that's going to be driven by some spreadsheet or word-processingpackage.''andM;As Sun, NeXT and other manufacturers struggle to capture a larger share ofthe workstation market, however, they will have to provide applicationsolutions that move beyond sophisticated development tools, analysts say.andM;Applications offering full-text database searches, stock-ticker information,and voice and electronic mail, for example, provide business users with a setof services that are available individually on PCs but are used moreoptimally when they are running together on a more powerful workstation,according to software developers.andM;''You could use a workstation to handle a direct feed of business news allday long, and with appropriate software either at the server or at theworkstation you could filter and accept stories only on those companiesyou're following,'' said Greg Gerdy, software publishing manager for DowJones andamp; Co.andP;  Inc. in Princeton, N.J.andM;While the user is running a spreadsheet or writing a memo -- or both -- inthe foreground, for example, the workstation could be monitoring the newswire, displaying stock information across the top of the screen and receivinga facsimile.andM;''You start to get into a combination of applications that arecompute-intensive enough to realistically require the high-performance,low-end workstations,'' said Bob Williams, vice president of marketing atVerity Inc., a Mountain View, Calif., company that offers full-textsearch-and-retrieval software for DOS and Unix workstations.andM;Some workstation applications will enable executives to use their time andcomputers more efficiently, said Stahlman.andP;  ''Ad hoc information retrieval,managing, organizing, building presentations, conferencing -- those are theprincipal applications,'' he said.andP;  ''This is work that's being done now, butnot on computers.''andM;Workstations could fill other niches within a corporation as well, analystssaid.andP;  Power users, always looking to do more tasks faster, are likely to useworkstations to improve throughput on their existing applications.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
