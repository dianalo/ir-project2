Transco said the move will reduce its pipeline revenue and has led to a review of dividend policies and other financial plans for both the parent and its units. But Transco said that, despite current disruption in its operations, the change in regulatory status for its main gas pipeline will protect the company from mounting gas-purchase liabilities.    The gas exploration, production and transmission company said it will cease operating under &quot;open access&quot; provisions of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and under its new &quot;closed&quot; status, it will reduce the volume of gas transported through its pipeline.    Under the &quot;open&quot; rules, the pipeline operator must provide pipeline access to all its customers, including utilities or other purchasers who buy gas cheaply from other sources, but transport it via pipelines such as Transco. But while the pipeline company is transporting cheap gas, it is obligated, under take-or-pay contracts, to purchase natural gas from producers even if delivery isn't taken by its customers.    In recent years, slack demand has saddled many pipeline operators with obligations to buy gas they didn't need. In the first quarter alone, Transco took an $81.2 million charge to settle some of those claims with gas producers, but said its estimated total of settlements had climbed to $900 million from a previous estimate of $550 million. So far, Transco said, it has paid about $450 million to gas producers to settle take-or-pay contract claims.    Transco said it was the first major pipeline to reverse its course from &quot;open access&quot; operations back to the closed method of operation. Pipelines have moved to become &quot;open access&quot; gas carriers as part of regulators' efforts to deregulate the natural gas industry.    But Transco complained that &quot;partial deregulation&quot; has resulted in unfair conditions for gas pipelines operating as open-access carriers. The company said federal regulators have allowed pipeline customers to avoid their obligations to buy high-cost gas from pipelines without giving the pipelines relief from their take-or-pay contracts with gas producers.    &quot;In the absence of an acceptable resolution to the industry-wide problem of take-or-pay and without some means to hold customers to their substantial long-term gas purchase obligations, we believe that to become a permanent open access pipeline at this time would expose the company to substantial additional financial risk,&quot; said George S. Slocum, Transco's president and chief executive officer.    Mr. Slocum said, however, that Transco would continue working with regulators and the natural gas industry to find a way to re-open its pipeline system.    &quot;For Transco, it's going to hurt,&quot; said David Ahl, analyst for Brown Brothers Harriman andamp; Co. He speculated that the move was part of a &quot;wrestling match&quot; between Transco and its gas buyers. He estimated that for every month Transco restricts the pipeline operations, it will lose 10 cents to 15 cents a share.    Transco stock fell $3.125 to $36.875 in active New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, after falling $2 a share Tuesday.    Separately, Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered the debt ratings for Transco and its Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. unit, affecting about $1 billion of securities. Moody's cited the increased financial leverage caused by required payments to producers, as well as continuing uncertainty about the recoverable amount of the payments. A Transco spokesman said the lowered debt &quot;reflects industry conditions.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
