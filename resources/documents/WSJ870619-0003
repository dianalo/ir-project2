An official of the agricultural biotechnology company said Calgene plans to begin the test in late summer on a one-acre plot in California's central valley.    The plants have been altered through gene-splicing to resist the effects of glyphosate, a widely used herbicide Monsanto Co. sells under the trade name Roundup. Calgene said greenhouse tests have shown the plants aren't harmed at normal field application rates.    The company also said it shortly will ask the Agriculture agency for approval to field test tomato plants with the same resistance. The department must rule on such requests within 60 days, a company official said.    By making plants resistant to weed-killers, Calgene hopes to allow farmers to save money by using fewer, more-timely applications.    Tobacco plants, which are easy for researchers to work with, were field-tested last fall on a research basis by a unit of Ciba-Geigy Ltd. The Calgene official said the company thinks the planned test on tomatoes will be the first test of a commercial variety at commercial levels of herbicide applications. </TEXT></DOC>
