The new mortgage, called a &quot;reduction option loan,&quot; will be available beginning today through the Shearson Lehman Mortgage Corp. subsidiary of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. and 200 other lenders, said Graham Williams, a senior executive vice president for the Shearson subsidiary.    Freddie Mac, a federally chartered corporation formed to increase the supply of home mortgage credit, will buy as much as $1 billion of the mortgages, providing the lenders securities backed by the home loans in return. The lenders then will sell the securities to Shearson Lehman, which may use them as collateral for other deals or resell them.    Mr. Williams said the mortgages will be conventional 30-year, fixed-rate loans, but with one important difference: Buyers will be able to reduce the rate on the loans once between the 13th and 59th monthly payments. The cost will be just $100 plus 0.25% of the original principal. On a loan of $100,000, Mr. Williams said, that would cost $350 -- far less than the $1,000 to $2,000 in fees typically charged to refinance the same size loan.    Buyers will have to pay a slightly higher initial rate for the new type of loan; Shearson Lehman estimates their rate will be about 0.125 percentage point above the current market rate. And buyers will have to wait for rates to fall at least two percentage points before exercising the option.    Warren Lasko, an executive vice president of the Mortgage Bankers Association, said the new mortgage eventually could dominate the fixed-rate mortgage market. &quot;It appeals to the consumers' dual desires for fixed-rate financing and to take advantage of lower rates if they come about,&quot; he said.    Moreover, Mr. Williams said, the loans should be attractive to lenders, who will be able to continue collecting servicing fees they would lose when loans are refinanced.    Leland Brendsel, president and chief executive officer of Freddie Mac, said the company will evaluate the performance of the securities backed by the new loans. He said this initial transaction may &quot;lead the way to an ongoing Freddie Mac program if the ROL (reduction option loan) concept takes off, as we believe it will.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
