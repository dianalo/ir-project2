The technology and materials, many of them commonly available,now can be shipped out of the country without prior approval by theCommerce Department. They include general industrial equipment suchas lathes and presses, photographic equipment, servo-control units,synchronous motors and a broad range of industrial chemicals.   ``This brings our export controls more closely in line with thoseof our allies and improves the competitive position of U.S.exporters,'' said Michael Zacharia, assistant secretary of commercefor export administration.   ``These changes focus controls on equipment with real potentialfor military use by our adversaries, while at the same time reducingunnecessary burdens on American businesses that export technologyproducts,'' he said.   The action was required under the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act, whichdirected the Commerce Department to remove restrictions on itemsupon which only the United States imposed national securitycontrols, unless the United States was the only source or wasseeking similar controls from its allies.   Some items will continue to be controlled because of regulationsrelated to nuclear non-proliferation and foreign policy concerns.</TEXT></DOC>
