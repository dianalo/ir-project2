China's economy has grown phenomenally in recent years. But so has inflation, dreaded by Chinese politicians because of its historical links with unrest and the fall of the previous Nationalist government. By official reckoning, inflation was 7.2% last year. Independent experts believe it was twice that, causing grumbling in a socialist society that had been protected against price increases until China began introducing free-market elements 10 years ago.    &quot;China's leaders are on a tightrope,&quot; says an Asian diplomat in Beijing. &quot;There is a consensus at the top to proceed with reform. But high inflation and poor agricultural results make it difficult to move forward.&quot;    The man primarily responsible for resolving the dilemma is Li Peng, who will be named premier during the three-week National People's Congress. In his address today, Mr. Li will prescribe caution, declaring a firm commitment to reform while stressing short-term measures to limit inflation, boost grain production and ensure economic stability.    The Congress, ostensibly China's highest legislative body but largely a rubber stamp for Communist Party policies, also will institutionalize major economic reforms. Some will benefit foreign businesses, such as plans for investment belts along the east coast and on Hainan Island, and a new law on &quot;cooperative&quot; joint ventures.    The law is expected to provide a sounder framework for Sino-foreign ventures in which profit, risk and management rights aren't strictly based on the percentage of equity each side holds, as under existing joint ventures. The Congress also is expected to lower tax rates for such ventures.    But most eyes at the Congress will be on the 59-year-old Mr. Li. By assuming the premiership, a post he has held on an acting basis since November, the no-nonsense, Soviet-trained technocrat takes over day-to-day control of the economy and foreign policy.    Mr. Li will be able to put allies in top government posts, but that doesn't ensure smooth sailing. That is because Mr. Li suffers an image problem, especially among Chinese intellectuals, many of whom believe that his political success is based less on ability and more on personal connections. As a child, he was taken under the wing of Chou En-lai, China's revered late premier, and he remains a favorite of the country's elderly leaders.    Mr. Li also needs to allay fears that he opposes some of the popular reforms pushed by his predecessor as premier, Zhao Ziyang. Mr. Li's own views aren't clearly articulated, though he is more cautious on reform than Mr. Zhao, who was promoted in October to head the Communist Party.    In policy statements prior to the Congress, Mr. Li stressed the need to control prices and stabilize the economy. Mr. Zhao, on the other hand, urged that China continue rapid growth despite the danger of inflation.    Some analysts in Beijing believe Mr. Li and Mr. Zhao have disagreed behind the scenes over economic policy but seem to have come to a truce, at least for now. The analysts believe the Congress, a key opportunity for China's leaders to propagate their short-term goals, will stress consensus -- calling for reform and stability. Such a compromise apparently has the blessing of Deng Xiaoping, who continues to exert dominant power over China even after retiring from most of his government and party posts last year.    The Congress last year rejected a law to give factory directors freedom to manage their state-owned enterprises without interference from local party officials, though its provisions were subsequently adopted experimentally around the country. This year, the Congress is expected to pass a watered-down version that will stress the principle of directors' independence, but preserve a role, albeit a murky one, for the party.    Approval of this so-called enterprise law will also bring into force an existing regulation on bankruptcy. But because bankruptcy is still a controversial concept under China's hybrid socialist system, it isn't likely they will soon become widespread. To date, only a few corporate failures have been permitted.    The Congress also will amend China's Constitution to safeguard recent reforms. One amendment acknowledges the right to exist of private enterprise, a fast-growing sector in the economy. Another enables organizations and individuals to transfer &quot;land-use rights,&quot; giving landholders the right to sublet their property for cash. </TEXT></DOC>
