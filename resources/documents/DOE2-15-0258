To calculate the relative intensitydistribution, the spatial spread resulting from angular spread is convolvedwith a two-dimensional step function whose shape corresponds to the applicatoraperture. Two different approaches to obtain angular spread or the equivalentspatial spread are investigated. In the first method, the pencil beamangular spread is assumed to be Gaussian in shape. The angular spreadconstants (sigma theta) are then obtained from the slopes of measuredintensity profiles. In the second method, the angular spread, in theform of an array of numerical values, is obtained by the deconvolutionof measured intensity profiles. After obtaining the angular spread, thecalculation for convolution is done in a number of parallel planes normalto the central axis at various distances from the electron collimator.Intensity at any arbitrary point in space is computed by interpolatingbetween intensity distributions in adjacent planes on either side ofthe point. The effects of variations in angular spread as a functionof field size for two treatment machines, one with a scanned electronbeam and the other with a scattering foil, have been studied. The consequencesof assuming angular spread to be of Gaussian shape are also examined.The electron intensity calculation techniques described in this paperapply primarily to methods of dose calculations that employ pencil beamsgenerated using Monte Carlo simulations.</TEXT></DOC>
