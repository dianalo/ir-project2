Cundill didn't indicate the subject of the proposed talks and no meeting has been scheduled, said Fred B. Rice, Cleveland-Cliffs director of finance. He said the Cundill group telephoned the company about two weeks ago. Cundill is a Vancouver, British Columbia-based investment advisory firm; other group members are Cundill affiliates.    In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the Cundill group said it holds for investment purposes a combined total of 914,000 Cleveland-Cliffs common shares, including 675,100 purchased from Sept. 29 through Nov. 20 for $6 to $10.125 each.

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Cleveland-Cliffs closed at $7.625 a share, down 37.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
