Helen Roman-Barber, chairman and chief executive officer,told the annual meeting that the company's plan to sell itsoverseas oil and gas assets has &quot;proved to be a difficult&quot;task.</LP><TEXT>   Denison sold its Canadian oil and gas properties lastNovember for 44.6 million Canadian dollars (US$37.7 million).Ms. Roman-Barber declined to place a value on the remainingassets, which are in Spain, Egypt, Italy and Greece.   &quot;We are dealing with the prospect that the oil and gasdivestiture program may not provide us with sufficient fundsto meet our financial obligations,&quot; she said.   The company has about C$316 million in debt and facespayments of C$31 million this year and C$86 million in 1991.It also will need about C$175 million next March to retractits Series B preferred shares. The company has the option topay stock for the shares, but Ms. Roman-Barber said Denisonhopes to be able to pay cash.   The company decided in 1989 to concentrate on its uraniumoperations. But uranium prices are at all-time lows, andDenison had a first-quarter loss of C$4.8 million, or 15Canadian cents a share.   On the Toronto Stock Exchange Friday, the company's ClassB shares fell one Canadian cent at C$1.13, well off theissue's 52-week high of C$5.375.   The company continues to have interests in potash and coalmining, though it wrote off its entire interest in its onlyremaining coal operation in 1986.   Jake Fowler, president and chief operating officer,wouldn't say which assets might be sold. &quot;We like the potashbusiness very much, but our core business is uranium,&quot; hesaid.   Mr. Fowler also said the company won't pay dividends onits common shares until &quot;we're generating sufficient cash.&quot;Denison doesn't have a set dividend policy. Previous paymentwas a stock dividend in Class B shares equal to 24 Canadiancents in Febuary 1989.</TEXT></DOC>
