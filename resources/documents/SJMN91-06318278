And too much can look bad.;   In the eight-way race for theFoothill-De Anza Community College District board, winning candidate DoloresSandoval raised $16,575 as of mid-October and spent about $11,700, at leastdouble what any of the other candidates did.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Peninsula Extra  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  AMOUNT OF FUNDING NO GUARANTEE OF VOTESTWO WINNING CAMPAIGNERS SPENT LITTLE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  School Scene  </MEMO><TEXT>     The other trustees elected last week were Judith Moss and Mary Mason; Mossraised about $2,500 and spent $1,835, and Mary Mason raised $6,332 and spent$4,760.;   Sandoval, who said that her campaign would end up in the $22,000range, said she felt she &quot;couldn't take any chances&quot; in the large district,which stretches from Cupertino to Los Altos Hills and has 198,922 registeredvoters. &quot;I did my damndest to reach out to the voters.;   &quot;I'm Hispanic,running in a primarily Anglo district, and young relative to the other boardmembers. I had to build up credibility and have people take me seriously, and. . . getting campaign literature out helped me do that,&quot; she said.;   &quot;I'mproud of what I did. Especially in these trying times, I think we're going toneed people who know how to fund-raise, and I think I proved I know how to dothat.&quot;;   Her donors included the colleges' Faculty Association PoliticalAction Committee and a chapter of the California School Employees Associationin the district.;   &quot;They felt abused by the (district's) budget crisis,&quot;Sandoval said. &quot;They also want somebody who will not automatically side withtop management.;   &quot;I'm in no position to say I will side with them all thetime. I will have an open ear.&quot;;   Sandoval, a math teacher at San LorenzoValley Junior High, also got funds from her local union and the politicalaction committee of the California Teachers Association, as well as the SantaClara County Central Labor Council Committee on Political Education, and theBuilding Trades Council in San Jose, to which her cement-worker fatherbelongs. She noted that she had many individual contributors as well.;   &quot;It'sjust an unprecedented amount of money spent on a school board race,&quot; said34-year trustee Robert Smithwick, who came in sixth place and said he neverspent more than about $400 in his history of campaigning. &quot;I don't like to seeschool board races politicized, and I think this race had some of thiselement.;   &quot;When people running for school board try to get various politicalorganizations to back (them), it's more like (running for the) Legislature,&quot;he said.;   First-place finisher Moss said that &quot;I demonstrated that you cando it without&quot; a costly campaign. She said she thought that &quot;the voters readthe ballot statements, and they voted for the candidate they liked, ratherthan based on advertising.&quot;;   Backers of the &quot;Best Schools&quot; measure in SanMateo County raised $66,800, and spent $51,616 as of mid-October, to pitch theplan for a half-cent sales tax increase. The increase was intended to helplengthen the school year and equalize funding among rich and poor districts.That amount was necessary, they said.;   Supervisor Tom Huening, a chairman ofthe campaign, said that a mailing to each county household costs more than$30,000, so the war chest was &quot;not a lot of money.&quot;;   The measure wasdefeated overwhelmingly, collecting only 28 percent of the votes.;   Lastweek, we reported that Gary Bacon, coordinator of Los Altos High's innovative&quot;Learning Community,&quot; was one of four finalists for the California Teacher ofthe Year award. He didn't make it, and said he was disappointed but &quot;contentwith what I got.&quot;;   Bacon said that the school has been supportive of himsince last spring, when it all started with the faculty electing him as theschool's Teacher of the Year. He then captured county honors. For theCalifornia competition, he wrote essays, was scrutinized in the classroom fora day by state Education Department representatives, and was quizzed inSacramento by state schools chief Bill Honig and a 12-member panel ofteachers, administrators and students.;   Bacon's students set their ownacademic goals, sign independent-study contracts with Bacon, arrange guestspeakers and assign themselves community service. &quot;We've got to involvestudents in important decisions about their education,&quot; Bacon said. &quot;Thatinvolvement creates a high level of commitment. . . . It goes from involvementto commitment to service.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Barbara Koh columnBy BARBARA KOH, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Peninsula/Am  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911113  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  731  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, November 13, 199100318278,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
