Soviet and East German diplomats used today's resumption ofEast-West talks on conventional weapons to jump into the disputewithin the NATO alliance over reducing short-range nuclear weapons.   West Germany and some European NATO members want superpowertalks on reducing short-range nuclear weapons, but the UnitedStates and Britain oppose them because of the Soviet advantage inconventional weapons. Washington and London also want to modernizethe short-range missiles.   East German Ambassador Klaus-Dieter Ernst insisted at today'sresumption of conventional arms talks that parallel talks onreducing short-range nuclear weapons are vital to Germans.   ``The shorter the range of the rockets, the more dead Germans,''he told a news conference, referring to the fact that East and WestGermans are most threatened by the short-range weapons.   The absence of parallel negotations on nuclear weapons ``wouldof course have negative effects'' on the Vienna talks onconventional arms, he added.   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, worried about the slidingpopularity of his center-right government, supports talks with theSoviets on reducing short-range nuclear weapons and wants topostpone a decision on modernizing the weapons until after nextyear's elections.   The Vienna talks opened March 9 with a mandate that specificallyexcluded nuclear rockets.   But Ernst and Soviet Ambassador Oleg A. Grinevsky said that theseven Warsaw Pact nations see talks on short-range nuclear weaponsand naval forces as part of overall efforts to reduce arms andincrease security in Europe.   U.S. Ambassador Steven J. Ledogar said he was disappointed whenevery East bloc speaker at today's closed-door talks mentioned thenuclear weapons, ``even as they admitted they have no place in thisnegotiation.''   ``I suspect that they know that there's a certain amount ofdiscussion in the NATO camp,'' he told reporters, referring to theinternal NATO rift.   Ledogar stressed that NATO squabbles over nuclear weapons willhave no effect on NATO unity at the Vienna talks. ``We are incomplete unison,'' he said.   Grinevsky used today's session to outline a plan dividing thezone covered by the talks _ from the Atlantic to the Ural mountainsdeep inside the Soviet Union _ into smaller regions.   He said the two sides should work to agree on overall totals forthe number of men and weapons each military bloc can possess, butalso agree on totals for each region.   The regions included a central European zone comprising WestGermany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Denmark on theNATO side, and Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary forthe Warsaw Pact. It is in this area that most of the deadlyweaponry of both military blocs is massed.   But Grinevsky failed to provide any overall weapons ceilings orfor the zones. Ledogar said such totals were vital for progress atthe talks.   At the previous round of talks that ended March 22, the WarsawPact outlined plans for reducing troops and weapons 10 percent to15 percent below present levels by 1994, a further 25 percent by1997 and moving to completely defensive forces by the year 2000.   NATO, by contrast, presented a more specific proposal forceilings on tanks, artillery and armored personnel carriers.   Both sides declared their willingness to get down to specificstoday, but remained divided over which weapons categories they wantto cut first.   NATO estimates that the Warsaw Pact will have more than a 2-to-1edge in tanks and artillery in Europe even after recently announcedunilateral troop cuts are carried out in the Soviet bloc.   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced in December that50,000 Soviet troops and 5,000 tanks would pull out of EastGermany, Hungary and Czechoslovakia by 1991. The withdrawals beganlast week in Hungary with the departure of 31 T-64 tanks.   Ernst said today that further unilateral cuts by the variousWarsaw Pact allies mean that, by 1991, the Soviet bloc will cut itstroops by 581,300 men, 12,751 tanks, 10,030 artillery systems,1,010 combat aircraft, 895 armored vehicles and 30 ``nuclearsystems.''</TEXT></DOC>
