WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The right-wing party that startled thecountry a week ago by winning 7.5 percent of the vote in Berlinelections would garner 11.5 percent in national balloting, accordingto a poll released Sunday.   The former Nazi SS soldier who heads the Republicans responded tothe poll, published by the weekly Welt am Sonntag, by predicting hisparty would win seats in the European Parliament.   ``With this, the sensation is perfect,'' Republican leader FranzSchoenhuber said. ``With this, our entrance into the EuropeanParliament in June of this year is more than likely.''   West Germany has 81 representatives in the 518-seat Parliament,based in Strasbourg, France. The Parliament discusses issues facingEurope but it has no legal powers.   Gains by the Republicans threaten further setbacks for ChancellorHelmut Kohl's center-right governing Christian Democratic Union,which has lost ground in the last five state elections.   According to Welt am Sonntag, a poll conducted over the past weekby the Wickert Institute in Tuebingen asked respondents which partycandidates they would vote for if elections were held the next day.   ``The Wickert Institute came to the conclusion that 11.5 percentof voters would choose the Republicans,'' the newspaper reported.   Party candidates in the Berlin legislative elections Jan. 29called for the ouster of foreign workers and asylum-seekers, many ofwhom are from Third World countries.   National elections are not scheduled until 1990, but there areseveral more state contests this year, including legislativeelections in the conservative stronghold of Bavaria, whereSchoenhuber's party enjoys its broadest support.   The newspaper gave few details of the poll, and no one answeredthe telephone at the Wickert Institute on Sunday.   Welt am Sonntag said those polled indicated they knew little ofthe Republicans prior to the Berlin elections Jan. 29 but believedthe ultra-rightists had been unfairly criticized by other politicalparties.   In Berlin, Schoenhuber's party won 11 of the 138 seats in thestate legislature and the right to send two representatives to thenational Parliament next year.   The Republicans say foreign workers have contributed to highunemployment and housing shortages _ problems nationwide butparticularly acute in Berlin.   The Christian Democratic Union and the opposition SocialDemocratic Party have accused the Republicans of stirring upnationalist sentiment.   A number of leftist and moderate West Germans stageddemonstrations after the Republican victories and accused theultra-rightists of espousing neo-Nazi beliefs.</TEXT></DOC>
