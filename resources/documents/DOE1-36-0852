These estimationsshowed that the artificial radioactivity before and even after the Chernobylaccident is only a fraction of the whole natural radiation dose. Forthe critical examination a risk evaluation is needed. The additionalradiation exposure as a consequence of the Chernobyl accident in thefirst year amounts only to 10 to 50 percent and in the life time dose(50 years) only to 1 percent of the background radiation dose. Thereforethe additional radiation exposure of the whole population by this accidentvia drinking water may be neglected. Nevertheless a local overload ofthe water path with natural or artificial radioactivity has to be controlledand the group of persons concerned has to be protected.</TEXT></DOC>
