With this procedurealone, reported local control rates for advanced stage tumors have beensuboptimal suggesting the need for adjuvant therapy. The treatment recordsof 35 patients were reviewed who were treated with composite resectionalone, composite resection plus radiotherapy, or composite resectionas a salvage procedure for a primary treatment failure. Combined irradiationand composite resection resulted in a higher local control than patientsreceiving composite resection alone (72% vs. 43%). There was no differencein complication rates between these two treatment groups. Composite resectionas a salvage procedure resulted in local control in 38% of patients thoughthis was associated with a 64% rate of complications. This data and areview of the literature suggest that tumors of the oral cavity and oropharynxwith extension to the mandible requiring composite resection probablyrepresent a category of tumors with a high risk of local recurrence andmay benefit from adjuvant irradiation.</TEXT></DOC>
