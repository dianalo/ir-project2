Clyde LeeConrad on charges that he reaped enormous profits as head of aninternational spy ring brought anguish to his family and stunnedresidents of his hometown.   ``I always thought I knew my son,'' Harry Conrad said. ``We werepretty tightly wrapped. If I had had this knowledge before it wouldhave killed me. It's about to kill me now.''   His sister, Karen Henschen, said family members had not spokenwith Conrad since his arrest Tuesday in Frankfurt, West Germany.His parents and his sister live in Alliance, about four miles westof this blue collar town where he grew up.   His relatives said they tried to keep in contact with Conradwhile he was in the military, but he never wrote back.   ``He always distanced himself from us,'' Ms. Henschen said. ``Hedidn't see big opportunities in Sebring. Joining the military was away for him to travel.''   Harry Conrad said in a television interview that he had not seenhis son in nine years, but other family members said they saw himwhen he came back in 1985 for a 20-year high school class reunion.   ``We love him, and we are quite certain he needs moralsupport,'' Harry Conrad said. ``There's no way we can take backwhat has happened, but his mom and dad and family love him and hehas our prayers.''   Conrad, 41, enlisted in the Army on Aug. 9, 1965, soon after hegraduated from Sebring McKinley High School. Acquaintances said heseldom returned to his hometown, about 55 miles southeast ofCleveland.   West German authorities are holding Conrad on charges of``compelling suspicion of espionage activities in an especiallygrave case.'' West German officials said millions of dollars inpayments by the Soviets may have been involved.   But few residents of the northeast Ohio city of 5,000 knew muchabout Conrad.   ``He was very quiet, very nice, and he kept mostly to himself,he went to the service at a very early age,'' said Mrs. RobertBlake, who has lived in the same house on McKinley Street for about30 years. The Conrads lived about four houses away.   John Garrett, who taught at the high school, remembered Conradas a student who excelled on the track and rifle teams, but neverexpressed any interest in politics or caused trouble.   ``I was very surprised. He went into the service right afterhigh school and he never seemed that outgoing or aggressive as ayoung person to do something like that,'' said Garrett, 51.   ``I went down to the coffee shop and saw some of the people whoknew him as a student and they were just stunned. He just wasn'tthat kind to make waves,'' he said.   Restaurateur Dennis Rohde made light of the news with patrons ofhis Tin Lantern cafe.   ``You want our spy sandwich?'' Rohde asked customers. ``It comeswith a secret decoder ring.''   But Rohde admitted the news seemed to have taken residents aback.   ``They live in this town for years, and they suddenly have a spyscandal and they say, `My God, how could it be someone fromhere?''' said Rohde, 50.   Officials have said the spy ring linked to Conrad was believedto have stolen documents concerning NATO defense plans for Europeand U.S. Army contingency plans for a ground war with the SovietUnion in Europe.   Army records released in Washington said Conrad worked for theU.S. military for 20 years, first as an infantryman and then as an``administration specialist.''   According to his service records, Conrad received the NationalDefense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, five ArmyCommendation medals, the Army Achievement Medal, three MeritoriousService medals and seven Good Conduct medals.</TEXT></DOC>
