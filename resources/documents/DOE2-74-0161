<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-74-0161 </DOCNO><TEXT>In an attempt to determine the origin and behaviour of incondensable gasesin geothermal fluids, a reservoir engineering approach was taken, thatis, in terms of balance of mass, thermodynamic transformations and two-phaseflow within a reservoir. Because of its high carbon dioxide content (3-10%superheated steam with 95% carbon dioxide/liter) and long history ofproduction, the Larderello (Italy) field was examined. Balance of massconsiderations and numerical simulation showed that only a small fractionof the carbon dioxide produced could have been originally stored in thereservoir fluid. Therefore, the major part of the gas must have beensupplied by an external source or by a mineralogical buffer. The formerexplanation seemed more probable, since variations with time in carbondioxide content were small even though the flow varied greatly. In thenumerical simulation of the production of water and carbon dioxide fromlow permeability rock (internal source hypothesis and with the assumptionthat carbon dioxide pressure was governed by the reaction), the behaviourof the carbon dioxide concentration was in accordance with field data.The fact that absolute values were less than those observed suggestedthat other possible reactions must be taken into consideration.</TEXT></DOC>
