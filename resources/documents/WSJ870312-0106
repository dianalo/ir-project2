Once the fastest-growing credit-card fraud, counterfeiting is fading rapidly. Counterfeiting-related losses at MasterCard International Inc. declined to about $5 million in 1986, from $16 million in 1985 and a peak $20 million in 1983. Visa International expects about $17 million in such losses in the year ending April 30, down from a high of $39.3 million in fiscal 1984.    Card fakery became a federal crime in 1984, and a Secret Service crackdown has reduced fraud. Visa International also credits authorization terminals that detect counterfeit cards and a computer search that can identify collusive merchants who knowingly accept counterfeit cards. MasterCard points to the addition of hard-to-copy holograms to cards -- a strategy it pioneered in 1983. But Visa downplays the role of holograms so far, noting that merchants until recently were still permitted to accept non-hologramed cards.    New York, Miami and Los Angeles have seen the most card fakery. Overseas, Visa has problems in France.    SQUEEZED OUT? Chilled orange juice overtakes frozen concentrate.    Last year, for the first time, consumers bought more ready-to-drink orange juice than they did frozen concentrate to make up themselves. That despite the fact that most chilled juice is made from concentrate. &quot;It's one less thing to hassle with in the morning,&quot; says Poonam Mittal, a Florida Department of Citrus researcher. Frozen has been cheaper, but price-cutting in chilled juice has narrowed the difference.    Florida tries to stimulate sales of frozen orange juice with a TV ad. The reason: The state dominates the frozen market, while Brazilian growers and out-of-state processors have made more inroads in chilled juice. &quot;We've had more competition, which has tended to drive the price down,&quot; says James Griffiths, head of a Florida growers group. Consumer Reports recently judged frozen products to taste better, but a Florida survey found shoppers don't perceive a difference.    ALTERNATIVE INSURERS sign up firms smarting from a coverage crisis.    Business liability-insurance shortages are easing. But the First National Bank of Port Allegany (Pa.) turned to a new industry-owned insurer when it found some protection still in short supply. Other businesses hope the many policyholder-owned insurers being formed will charge lower, or at least more stable, prices than regular insurers. &quot;I give the insurance industry a flat-out 'F' for consistency,&quot; says Mississippi Chemical Corp. risk manager Timothy Sterling, an organizer of the planned Corporate America's Risk Exchange, an alternative insurer dubbed CARE.    Traditional insurers complain. &quot;How can nonprofessionals assume they can do better than the professionals?&quot; asks Aetna Life andamp; Casualty Co. Vice Chairman William Bailey. Meanwhile, state regulators worry about future financial problems -- and even fraud -- because alternative insurers usually are subject to little supervision. &quot;I hope we don't have more problems created than are solved,&quot; says Edward Muhl, Maryland's insurance commissioner.    Question for the future: Will regular insurers be able to regain lost business when the crisis is past?    LAST HURRAH: Reporters who in recent years covered Navistar International Corp., formerly troubled International Harvester Co., are invited to a Chicago breakfast gathering March 25. The host: Chairman Donald Lennox, who retires that day.    BORROW, DON'T SAVE, to get a toaster at the bank: Gifts are the latest twist in the heated battle for home-equity borrowers, says Bank Advertising News. For instance, Mechanics Savings Bank, Hartford, Conn., offers cordless telephones, luggage sets and other gifts worth $85 to $115.    &quot;BLACK BOXES&quot; for trucks? Insurers want trucks, like airplanes, to carry electronic recorders. Aim: to reduce accidents by increasing compliance with limits on drivers' time on the road. Truckers are opposed; so is the Department of Transportation. Insurers seek a rehearing.    DISCOUNTS ON BOOKS shrink, but price-cutting is here to stay.    Harry Hoffman, president of giant Waldenbooks, says his company and No. 2 B. Dalton Bookseller have &quot;seen the light&quot; and backed off from unprofitably large discounts on best sellers. Waldenbooks is shaving 15% to 20% off top titles, down from 25% to 35% a year ago. In 1986, both chains also closed or limited separate discount units. After heated price wars, people said, &quot;Hey, wait a minute, this is nuts,&quot; says Bernard Rath of the American Booksellers Association.    Many industry officials believe deep discounting is now past, while moderate reductions will be the norm. &quot;It's part of a marketing program to build loyalty to our stores,&quot; says Mr. Hoffman of Waldenbooks. The January purchase of B. Dalton by a group led by discounter Barnes andamp; Noble Bookstores Inc. creates uncertainty about B. Dalton's future pricing, but radical changes are considered unlikely.    Bucking the trend, regional discounter Crown Books Corp. discounts its best sellers by 40%, compared with 35% in 1985.    BRIEFS: Antique fire engines are the attraction at Phoenix's Hall of Flame. . . . According to Decision Research Corp., 60% of corporate chief financial officers prepare their own tax returns. </TEXT></DOC>
