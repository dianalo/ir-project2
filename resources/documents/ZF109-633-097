Vectra QS/16S computer, a 386SX machinerunning at 16 MHz with 2M of RAM and a 40M hard drive.andM;The system also includes a Hewlett-Packard VGA plus color monitor and an HPThinkjet printer.andP;  These printers are &quot;a little slower, but a lot quieter foruse in hospitals and libraries,&quot; said David Carter, Information Access'product marketing manager.andP;  In addition, the system uses Sony Corp. 510CD-ROM drives.andM;Two other VA sites installed the system in September, Carter said.andP;  They arethe VA hospitals in Long Beach, Calif., and in Sepulveda, Calif.andM;&quot;Basically, the Health Reference Center is a health information database forlay people,&quot; said Crista Bustwell, director of the library at the West L.A.andO;VA hospital.andM;&quot;The real breakthrough, over other systems, is its full-text searchcapability.andP;  For instance, a patient can come in and ask for information onprostate cancer, and they can get all the information they need straight outof the medical journals,&quot; she said.andM;Healthy KnowledgeandM;Before the Health Reference Center, &quot;we'd have to search for the informationmanually,&quot; Bustwell said.andP;  The hospital library maintains a &quot;huge collection&quot;of pamphlets, journals and medical text, but &quot;the system is a lot quicker andprovides more coverage than we could give,&quot; she said.andM;Now three members of the library staff use the system to retrieve informationfor patients, but Bustwell said that, eventually, she would like to put asystem in the outpatient area for anyone to use.andM;With its simple user interface and because the information in the systemcomes from the &quot;less-complicated&quot; medical journals, &quot;no prior knowledge ofthe medical field or of computers is needed to run the system,&quot; Bustwellsaid.andM;The Health Reference Center is based on more than 110 of the most prestigiouspublications covering consumer health concerns such as illnesses, prenatalcare, dieting, drug abuse, mental health, sports medicine, cardiovasculardisease, biotechnology, gerontology and medical costs.andM;The system uses publications such as the Harvard Medical School Newsletter,Prevention, Hippocrates and the Centers for Disease Control's AIDS Alert.andO;Most articles date from January 1989 to the present, but the system containssignificant information indexed from January 1986.andM;Monthly UpdatesandM;The database is updated monthly so that it includes timely material.andP;  It alsouses hypertext features, such as the ability to &quot;click&quot; on a term and receivea definition.andM;The system features direct-access searching and guided-access searching.andO;With direct-access searching the user immediately retrieves articlereferences, abstracts, summaries, and full text, as well as medicaldefinitions.andP;  Guided-access searching coaches the user through a series ofmenus to establish, expand and refine searches.andM;The system also offers the user computer-assisted searches of books such asMosby's Medical and Nursing Dictionary; The Columbia University College ofPhysicians and Surgeons Complete Home Medical Guide; The People's Book ofMedical Tests; and The Consumer Health Information Source Book.andM;In addition, the system features patient guided-access modules, which providebackground information on illnesses including their cause, prevention,therapy and questions to ask a physician.andM;The database uses Library of Congress headings enhanced by medical subjectheadings created by the National Library of Medicine.andM;Although the Health Reference Center is not yet being sold, InformationAccess has set a tentative price of $10,000 per year for a subscription tothe system or $12,000 with the computer system included.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
