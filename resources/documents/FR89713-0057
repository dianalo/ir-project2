Version 1 of GOSIP, adoptedas FIPS 146, provided Open Systems Interconnection protocols for electronicmail and file transfer functions. The proposed revision incorporates Version2 of GOSIP which provides protocols for the following additional functions:a. The Virtual Terminal Service (TELNET and Forms profiles); b. The Office Document Architecture; c. The Integrated Services Digital Network; d. The End System-Intermediate System protocol; and, as user options, e. The Connectionless Transport Service; and f. The Connection Oriented Network Service. Version 2 of GOSIP is based on agreements reached by vendors and user ofcomputer networks participating in this National Institute of Standardsand Technology (NIST) Workshop for Implementors of Open Systems Interconnection.Prior to the submission of this proposed revision to the Secretary of Commercefor review and approval, it is essential to assure that consideration isgiven to the needs and views of manufacturers, the public, and State andlocal governments. The purpose of this notice is to solicit such views.This proposed revision contains two sections: (1) An announcement section,which provides information concerning the applicability, implementation,and maintenance of the standard; and (2) a specifications section, GOSIP,which references protocols for the open systems environment. Only the announcementsection of the standard is provided in this notice.

GOSIP definesa common set of data communication protocols which enable systems developedby different vendors to interoperate and enable the users of differentapplications on these systems to exchange information. These Open SystemsInterconnection (OSI) protocols were developed by international standardsorganizations, primarily the International Organization for Standardization(ISO) and the Consultative Committee on International Telephone and Telegraph(CCITT). GOSIP is based on agreements reached by vendors and users of computernetworks participating in the National Institute of Standards and Technology(NIST) Workshop for Implementors of Open Systems Interconnection.<T3>Approving Authority. </T3>Secretary of Commerce.<T3>Maintenance Agency. </T3>U.S. Department of Commerce, National Instituteof Standards and Technology, National Computer Systems Laboratory.Cross Indexa.

Version 1 of GOSIP supports the MessageHandling Systems and File Transfer, Access and Management applications.Version 1 of GOSIP also supports interconnection of the following networktechnologies: CCITT Recommendation X.25; Carrier Sense Multiple Accesswith Collision Detection (IEEE 802.3); Token Bus (IEEE 802.4); and TokenRing (IEEE 802.5). Version 2 of GOSIP contains the following functionalitynot included in Version 1.a. The Virtual Terminal Service (TELNET and Forms profiles);b. The Office Document Architecture;c. The Integrated Services Digital Network;d. The End System-Intermediate System protocol; and, as user options,e. The Connectionless Transport Service; and f. The Connection Oriented Network Service.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Additional applications and network technologies will be added tolater versions of the GOSIP document.<T3>Implementation. </T3>Version 1 of GOSIP was effective February 15,1989. For a period of 18 months after that date, agencies are permittedto acquire alternative protocols which provide equivalent functionalityto the protocols defined in Version 1. After August 15, 1990, Version 1of GOSIP must be cited in solicitations and contracts for the acquisitionof new network products and services providing the functionality definedin Version 1.Version 2 of GOSIP will be effective on the day that it is announced inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4> following approval by the Secretary, and doesnot change the implementation schedule established for the protocols definedin Version 1. For a period of 18 months following the effective date forVersion 2, agencies are permitted to acquire alternative protocols whichprovide equivalent functionality to the protocols defined in Version 2.Eighteen (18) months after the effective date of Version 2 of GOSIP, theprotocols in Version 2 must be cited in solicitations and contracts whenthe systems to be acquired provide equivalent functionality to the protocolsdefined in the GOSIP document. Because the Connectionless Transport Serviceand the Connection Oriented Network Service in Version 2 of GOSIP are optionalservices for use under restricted conditions, the mandatory compliancedate does not apply to those protocols.OSI protocols providing additional functionality will be added to new versionsof GOSIP as implementation specifications for these protocols are developedby the NIST Workshop for Implementors of OSI.For the indefinite future, agencies will be permitted to buy network productsin addition to those specified in GOSIP and its successor documents. Suchproducts may include other nonproprietary protocols, proprietary protocols,and features and options of OSI protocols which are not included in GOSIP.The National Institute of Standards and Technology is developing a programto accredit testing organizations for specific tests or types of testsfor computer products and services. Information on these tests and testprocedures will be made available in the future. Until the tests and testprocedures are available, government agencies acquiring networks and servicesin accordance with this standard may wish to require testing for conformance,interoperation, and performance. The tests to be administered and the testingorganization are at the discretion of the agency Acquisition Authority.Guidance on testing for GOSIP specifications is contained in Section 2of the GOSIP document.<T3>Waivers.</T3> Under certain exceptional circumstances, the heads ofFederal departments and agencies may approve waivers to Federal InformationProcessing Standards (FIPS). The head of such agency may redelegate suchauthority only to a senior official designated pursuant to section 3506(b)of title 44, U.S. Code. Waivers shall be granted only when: a. Compliance with a standard would adversely affect the accomplishmentof the mission of an operator of a Federal computer system, or b. Cause a major adverse financial impact on the operator which is notoffset by Governmentwide savings. Agency heads may act upon a written waiver request containing the informationdetailed above. Agency heads may also act without a written waiver requestwhen they determine that conditions for meeting the standard cannot bemet. Agency heads may approve waiver only by a written decision which explainsthe basis on which the agency head made the required finding(s). A copyof each decision, with procurement sensitive or classified portions clearlyindentified, shall be sent to: National Institute of Standards and Technology;ATTN: FIPS Waiver Decisions, Technology Building, Room B-154; Gaithersburg,MD 20899. In addition, notice of each waiver granted and each delegation of authorityto approve waivers shall be sent promptly to the Committee on GovernmentOperations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on GovernmentalAffairs of the Senate and shall be published promptly in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>When the determination on a waiver applies to the procurement of equipmentand/or services, a notice of the waiver determination must be publishedin the <T3>Commerce Business Daily</T3> as a part of the notice of solicitationfor offers of an acquisition or, if the waiver determination is made afterthat notice is published, by amendment to such notice. A copy of the waiver, any supporting documents, the document approvingthe waiver and any supporting and accompanying documents, with such deletionsas the agency is authorized and decides to make under 5 U.S.C. 552(b),shall be part of the procurement documentation and retained by the agency.<T3>Special Information.</T3> The appendices to the GOSIP specificationdescribe advanced requirements for which adequate profiles have not yetbeen developed. Federal government priorities for meeting these requirementsand the expected dates that work on these priorities will be completedare also provided. As these work items are addressed and completed by theNIST Workshpp for Implementors of OSI, addenda will be inserted into theGOSIP document. <T3>Where to Obtain Copies.</T3> Copies of this publication are for saleby the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), U.S. Department ofCommerce, Springfield, VA 22161.
