The 800-page report, the most extensive study of a railroad ever performed by the agency, faults the big freight hauler for unsafe operating practices and inadequate safety and training programs, according to a Transportation Department official familiar with the audit. The official said the railroad agency was shocked by some of the problems it uncovered.    The official said the Philadelphia-based railroad's shortcomings are &quot;fixable&quot; because they are caused by &quot;people problems&quot; rather than by deteriorating equipment. &quot;The track and signal systems are quite good,&quot; he said. The report won't be used to fine the railroad, he said.    A Conrail spokesman said the company is conducting &quot;an in-depth review&quot; of the report. But he said a preliminary review &quot;indicates that there are a number of instances where Conrail will disagree with conclusions that could be drawn from the FRA comments and/or recommendations. We will convey those views to FRA as part of our overall response.&quot;    Last month, the National Transportation Safety Board, an independent agency that investigates transportation accidents, formally cited a Conrail engineer's use of marijuana as a prime cause of the January 1987 collision between a string of Conrail locomotives and an Amtrak passenger train in Chase, Md. That accident killed 16 people and injured more than 170.    However, the railroad agency's audit of Conrail wasn't prompted by the Maryland accident; agency officials had decided in the fall of 1986 to take a close look at Conrail because it was the only major railroad that hadn't been audited. &quot;It was a tradition that government didn't assess its own railroads,&quot; the official said.    Moreover, federal regulators throughout 1986 had become increasingly concerned about Conrail's safety performance because of its involvement in several minor accidents, the official said. Conrail, created from the remnants of a handful of bankrupt railroads, was sold by the government in a public stock offering last year.    In the case of the Maryland accident, federal investigators found that blood and urine tests of the Conrail engineer and a fireman showed evidence of marijuana, and that they went through &quot;slow&quot; and &quot;stop&quot; signals into the path of the Amtrak train bound for New York from here.    The Federal Railroad Administration has ordered installation by mid-1990 of automatic controls on all trains operating on the high-speed Northeast Corridor. </TEXT></DOC>
