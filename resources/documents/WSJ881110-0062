But recently, as a wave of Japanese-initiated takeovers of foreign companies makes clear, corporate Japan has started poaching big game. To be sure, publicity-shy Japanese companies remain wary of hostile transactions. But instead of poring over investment bankers' lists of companies on the block, as they once did, Japanese executives are identifying and going after foreign targets on their own.    The scale of Japanese transactions to date is modest in contrast to the megadeals shaking Wall Street. But the threat posed by Japan's transformation from passive hunter to strategic predator is all the more real because Japan's trade surpluses and soaring currency give its companies seemingly bottomless pockets.    In this year's first seven months, Japanese companies snapped up 95 foreign concerns in transactions totaling $9 billion, according to Industrial Bank of Japan. That compares with 146 acquisitions totaling $6.4 billion in all of 1987, which in turn was double the figure a year earlier. A recent survey found that two-thirds of Japanese companies are interested in making acquisitions, up from one-in-five three years ago.    Until recently, most such transactions were initiated by foreign sellers, not by Japanese buyers. But a number of companies have felt the prod of Japan's blunt new style.    AM International Inc., a Chicago maker of business graphics equipment, once considered forming a joint venture with Komori Printing Machinery Co. of Tokyo, but talks led nowhere. Six months later, AM International discovered Komori was accumulating its stock and, when asked, wouldn't agree to stop. Merle H. Banta, AM International's chairman and chief executive, says he concluded Komori wanted to &quot;coerce&quot; the U.S. company into selling its web-press group &quot;at a noncompetitive price.&quot;    After months of standoff, AM International sold the web-press operations in June to a West German group that outbid Komori. The Japanese company still controls 7.6% of AM International and says through an adviser it &quot;isn't satisfied&quot; with the U.S. company's performance.    Unsolicited Japanese takeovers don't necessarily bode trouble. Pace Industries Inc. was in the process of selling its Rheem Manufacturing Co. unit, a maker of water heaters, when the stock market collapsed last year and destroyed the buyer's financing plans. But family-owned Paloma Co., a Japanese appliances manufacturer, weighed in uninvited to save the day with an $850 million offer.    Sumitomo Electric Industries Ltd. of Osaka recently paid $22.5 million to buy Judd Wire, a small wire-making unit of High Voltage Engineering Corp., Burlington, Mass. Sumitomo set its sights on the 150-employee division after High Voltage itself was taken over early this year by a New York investment group, Hyde Park Holdings Inc.    Sumitomo persuaded the new owners to sell Judd Wire directly instead of auctioning it off as Hyde Park had planned. Sumitomo officials admit their aggressive strategy may have driven up Judd Wire's price.    Where a U.S. company may insist on a 15% annual return, Japanese industry, with its tradition of stable shareholders and lax attitudes about earnings per share, may settle for less. &quot;The Japanese are very long-term, very strategic in their thinking; it's market penetration they seek,&quot; says Charles M. Nathan, co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Salomon Brothers Inc. in New York.    The sums Japanese companies pay for overseas acquisitions is one measure of their newly aggressive stance. The Seibu/Saison Group, a private Japanese retailer, recently signed a $2.15 billion agreement to buy the Intercontinental Hotel chain from Britain's Grand Metropolitan PLC. The 100-hotel chain had been for sale for months without a taker at Grand Met's price. Eager to get into the international hotel business, Seibu Saison was willing to meet what its bankers call the &quot;opportunity cost.&quot;    Similar examples of cash-rich determination abound. Nippon Mining Co. wanted a toehold in high technology; it paid $1.1 billion for Gould Inc., of the U.S. Bridgestone Corp., afraid of being closed out of the U.S. tire market, paid $2.6 billion in a bidding war for Firestone Tire andamp; Rubber Co.    &quot;If a company is already for sale, the price is negotiable,&quot; says Nobuyuki Koya, deputy general manager for mergers and acquisitions at Tokyo's Sanwa Bank. &quot;But if you just approach a company, as many Japanese are doing, they ask a very, very high price.&quot; As a result, some observers fear the Japanese will do to U.S. industry what they did to the real-estate and art markets: Pay prices so high they drive buyers out of the market.    Not so, contend other merger and acquisition experts. &quot;I've noticed an increasing sensitivity among the Japanese to being known for paying a 'Japanese premium,' a premium nobody else is willing to pay,&quot; says Paul K. Kelly, president of Peers andamp; Co., a New York investment bank partowned by Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan and which advised on the Seibu Saison purchase. &quot;They don't want to appear imprudent in the amounts they pay.&quot;    The glaring instance where a Japanese concern is considered to have overpaid was Bridgestone's acquisition of Firestone. But Bridgestone and other Japanese say the strategic implications of buying into a huge, mature market were overwhelming. Bridgestone President Akira Yeiri says he was ready to pay even more.    Buying foreign companies is attractive to the Japanese not only because the yen's appreciation makes the acquisitions seem less expensive as domestic production gets more expensive, but also because it provides market access.    &quot;This is just the beginning,&quot; says Shigeju Kita, a general manager at Yamaichi Securities, the first big Japanese firm to specialize in takeovers when it created a mergers and acquisitions unit in 1972. &quot;We will be facilitators in a global industrial restructuring.&quot;    A few years ago, the Japanese were the stepchildren of the takeover world. U.S. and European buyers were shown the best deals. Slow to make up their minds and wary of labor unions and political trouble, Japan's businessmen were shown the junk. That isn't the case any more.    Last spring, Toso Corp., a chemical company, took just two weeks to decide to make a $33 million purchase of the specialty metals division of Varian Associates Inc. Jun Imanishi, a managing director at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. in Tokyo, says the new assertiveness shows up regularly: &quot;On one assignment, we gave a client five ideas, and they came back to us and said one of them just happened to be a company they were thinking of.&quot;    Indeed, many Japanese multinationals are drawing up shopping lists, some with targets in major U.S. and European markets. More than 20 Japanese companies have mergers and acquisitions units. &quot;The more sophisticated companies are bold enough to say who they like,&quot; says John V. Rindlaub, a managing director specializing in Japanese mergers at Bankers Trust Co. in New York. &quot;Bankers Trust has been given assignments where a Japanese company says: 'We know so and so in some industry; would you approach them and ask if they are interested in selling a division or being acquired?'&quot;    &quot;When we see a need for an acquisition, then we consider it,&quot; says Ikuei Miyamoto, general manager of international operations at Yoshida Kogyo K.K., or YKK, a leading zipper maker. Rather than build a U.S. plant, the family-controlled company this year paid $50 million for Universal Fasteners Inc., a competitor based in Kentucky. &quot;They bought instant market-share with no headaches,&quot; says a banker familiar with the transaction.    Despite their new confidence, the Japanese say they aren't about to engage in a run of hostile takeovers. Unfriendly acquisitions, Japanese executives say, fly in the face of Japan's notion of what the corporation is all about -- a paternalistic, cooperative effort of many employees for the collective good.    &quot;The basic idea of mergers and acquisitions is negative in Japan,&quot; says Sumitomo Electric administrator Kasuichi Hayashi, noting that Japanese companies usually resort to them domestically only to stave off a company's failure. &quot;But that's the way of business in other countries, so we have to accept it.&quot;    By contrast, an unfriendly takeover is fundamentally aimed at enhancing shareholders' return. Japanese businessmen &quot;don't think it's a proper way of doing things,&quot; says Peter Rona, president and chief executive of IBJ Schroder Bank andamp; Trust Co. in New York, a subsidiary of Industrial Bank of Japan. &quot;It's a little like saying the purpose of marriage is sex.&quot;    ---   Japan's Major Acquisitions in the U.S. This Year   (Parent companies in parentheses)                                            Price                                         (in millions  Investor           Target Company       of dollars)  Date  Bridgestone Corp.
