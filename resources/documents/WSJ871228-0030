The new package will make more gains possible, he said.    &quot;We won't stop here,&quot; he added. &quot;We'll see later on which sectors still need to be taken care of.&quot;    As expected, the new package doesn't tackle monopolies in the plastics industry that are controlled by relatives or friends of President Suharto. However, to the surprise of some observers, it does include some deregulation of steel trading, another area in which there are such monopolies.    Under the package:   --The period during which foreign investors must transfer 51% of a joint venture to domestic shareholders was increased to 15 years from 10.    --Any company that holds a general business license may export any product except those, such as textiles and coffee, that are governed by export quotas. Previously, special export licenses were required.    --Groundwork was established for the creation of an over-the-counter market to supplement trading on the local stock exchange. The new market, unlike the existing exchange, will be open to foreign participation.    The reform package is the sixth to be announced since officials began efforts three years ago to deregulate the economy in order to increase efficiency and competitiveness. </TEXT></DOC>
