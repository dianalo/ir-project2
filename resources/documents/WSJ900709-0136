France said it first wanted to ensure thatsuch talks wouldn't be aimed at dismantling the EC's commonagricultural policy. West Germany and Japan largely ignoredU.S. suggestions that they should stimulate their economiesmore. The U.S. and other summit countries succeeded inslapping down French calls for an international monetaryconference.   ---   May 4-6, 1986, Tokyo, Japan                                                                                                          Participants: Ronald Reagan, Brian Mulroney, FrancoisMitterrand, Helmut Kohl, Amintore Fanfani, Yasuhiro Nakasone,Margaret Thatcher, Jacques Delors   Main Subjects: Trade; international economic-policycoordination; the U.S.-Japan economic relationship   Declarations: To overhaul agricultural policies as part ofa bid to rewrite the world's trade treaty; reaffirmed acommitment to non-inflationary growth, the environment andother summit favorites; to cooperate more on fightinginternational terrorism   Outcome: The wrangle over agricultural policies continuesto this day.

The U.S. didn't get the total endorsementit sought for its tough action to protect shipping in theArabian Gulf, and President Reagan didn't get the support hewanted on arms control.   ---   June 19-21, 1988, Toronto, Canada   Participants: Ronald Reagan, Brian Mulroney, FrancoisMitterrand, Helmut Kohl, Ciriaco de Mita, Noburu Takeshita,Margaret Thatcher, Jacques Delors   Main Subjects: Imbalances in the global economy;macroeconomic policies and exchange rates; multilateral tradetalks; newly industrializing economies; developing countriesand debt; the environment   Declarations: Strong support for Uraguay Round of GATTtalks, for the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement, and for theEuropean Community's move toward a single market by the endof 1992; call for continued reform of agricultural policies,particularly protectionist measures in developed countries;pledge to give the poorest developing nations -- mostly insub-Saharan Africa -- more breaks in the form of further IMF,World Bank and government credits, and through cuts in theirexisting debts   Outcome: More Western governmetns wrote off or madeconcessions on loans to sub-Saharan Africa. The EC began tomake some limited efforts to cut back its huge agriculturalsubsidies.   ---   July 14-16, 1989, Paris, France                                                                                                          Participants: Ronald Reagan, Brian Mulroney, FrancoisMitterrand, Helmut Kohl, Ciriaco de Mita, Noburu Takeshita,Margaret Thatcher, Jacques Delors   Main Subjects: Eastern Europe; the Brady debt strategy;the environment; Tiananmen Square massacre   Declarations: To aid Poland and Hungary; to clean up theworld's air and waters; cautious response to Soviet proposalto link up with the world's industrial economies; endorsementof new U.S.-backed debt strategy that stressed cutting backthe bank debts and interest payments of developing countries;call for futher reductions in the U.S. budget deficit;condemnation of the massacre in Tiananmen Square   Outcome: Western aid packages were put together for Polandand Hungary and other states in Eastern Europe. But thesehave tended to rely on trade privileges, technical help andloans. The new debt strategy produced small cuts in theforeign debt of Mexico and the Philippines. But privatecredit to the debtors slowed from a trickle to a drip. Chinawas denied loans from summit countries for almost a year. TheU.S. still is wrestling with its federal budget deficit.
