Now, they are confused, upset and looking no furtherthan today's unassuming opponent, the Phoenix Cardinals (4-7).  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  WARY OF FAILURE, PHOENIX49ERS LEARN HOW OTHER HALF LIVES  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  The NFL / Week 12  </MEMO><TEXT>     Losing has been a foreign concept around 49ers headquarters the past fewseasons. It happened to the other guys.;   &quot;Now it's happening to us,&quot; saidsecond-year running back Dexter Carter.;   Has all that success been taken forgranted? If so, then at least two 49ers with heaps of experience otherwise areoffering insight and advice on dealing with adversity.;   &quot;Some guys justcan't deal with it,&quot; said tight end Jamie Williams who, as a Houston Oilerduring their dreadful 1984-88 seasons, endured the downside of the game.;  While Williams was with Houston, the Oilers went 32-47, bottoming out at 3-13in 1984.;   &quot;When I was at Houston, we just barely won two games a year,&quot; hesaid. &quot;That was tough when you saw somebody new next to your locker everyweek.;   &quot;The guys (49ers) who have gone through it in junior high, highschool and college have probably forgotten what it's like.&quot;;   Adding to thefrustration is the slim margin that has separated victory and defeat thisseason for the 49ers -- all six of their losses have been by seven points orless.;   &quot;When you get blown out, you know you're not as good as youropponent,&quot; Williams said. &quot;No one's been around here when we've lost so manyclose games. It has an effect on everybody. It eats away at you at home. Youcan't escape it.&quot;;   Safety Dave Waymer, who played 10 seasons with the NewOrleans Saints, vividly recalls that losing feeling. In his first two seasons,the Saints were 5-27.;   &quot;Having gone through that, it helps now, but itdoesn't make it any better,&quot; said Waymer, who signed with the 49ers as a freeagent in 1990. &quot;Because nobody wants to lose. That's the reason why I camehere -- because this team wins.&quot;;   Learning not to accept adversity, butrather to overcome it, has been something Williams and Waymer have beenpreaching this week.;   &quot;Every team goes through that kind of stuff and at onetime this team did,&quot; Waymer said. &quot;I told some of the guys that when you'rehaving tough times, it really makes you appreciate the easier ones.&quot;;   Somemight say today's opponent means an easy time for the 49ers, who have lost twoin a row and also are playing without their top two quarterbacks, Joe Montanaand Steve Young, both of whom are injured.;   The Cardinals have lost threeconsecutive games and are going to their No. 3 quarterback, World League ofAmerican Football alumnus Stan Gelbaugh, as their last resort.;   The 49ersalso are down to their No. 3 quarterback, Steve Bono, who struggled to movethe offense last week in a 10-3 loss to the division-leading Saints.;  Critics say the first completed pass wins. And the winner gets to experiencewhat success feels like again.;   &quot;What I can tell guys out here is we're notin this game to be losing,&quot; Waymer said. &quot;A win will fix everything.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  NANCY GAY, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911117  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  21D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  567  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, November 17, 199100322120,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
