The rally gained strength late in the day after wavering in Asianand European trading. The dollar soared past 2.03 West German marksin spite of attempts by the Federal Reserve to keep it below thatlevel through dollar sales.   ``To be short dollars these days is like committing suicide,''said Gary Lutnick, a currency trader at Banco di Sicilia in New York.   Since the end of April the dollar has risen 13 percent againstthe Japanese yen, 8 percent against the West German mark and 11percent against the British pound.   The rally has broken a long period of relative stability andbrought the dollar back to levels of 1987 and late 1986.   The strong dollar increases the spending power of Americans'money but could hurt the economy in the long run by makingAmerican-made goods more expensive in world markets, worsening theU.S. trade deficit. The dollar's ascent in the early 1980s partlywas blamed for throwing American factory workers out of their jobs.   Fueling the dollar's rise Wednesday was speculation that theCommerce Department would report an April merchandise trade deficitof $6 billion to $8 billion, down from $8.9 billion in March, saidJohn Lyman, a senior currency dealer for the Bank of Tokyo in NewYork.   It would take more than a year for the full impact of thedollar's recent rise to show up in deteriorating trade figures.   Speculators accumulated dollars for their own accounts Wednesday,hoping they would rise in value because of a favorable trade report,Lyman said.   However, the bloated dollar holdings could send the market lowerif the trade deficit turned out to be much larger than expected andspeculators sold the currency.   In London, the pound fell to $1.5143 from $1.5162 late Tuesday.Later in New York, sterling fell to $1.5120 from $1.5270 on Tuesday.
