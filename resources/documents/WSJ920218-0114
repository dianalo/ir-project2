A preliminary settlement of civil suits reached Fridayprovides for Mr. Milken to add $500 million to the $400million he previously paid government regulators. The dealwould dispose of the hundreds of lawsuits pending against Mr.Milken and protect him from most future ones, lawyers said.</LP><TEXT>   Other former officials at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. willadd $300 million to the pot, and insurers are expected tothrow in $100 million -- bringing the total to $1.3 billion.   The settlement, perhaps the last great event in a 10-yearsaga of power and scandal, may prove to be controversial. Theexpected payout is the largest ever by an individual, yetwill still leave the jailed financier in control of a fortuneof $500 million or more. The deal won't require Mr. Milken toadmit a role in the savings-and-loan debacle, but hisdecision to pay so dearly will leave questions about whatpart he might have played.   Also, in deference to Mr. Milken's market acumen, he isexpected to be given three years to manage and dispose ofinvestment partnership assets that will contribute to thesettlement fund -- a task he'll perform personally from hisbunk at Federal Prison Camp Pleasanton in California. Mr.Milken pleaded guilty in 1990 to six securities-relatedfelonies.   The new pact covers lawsuits by individuals claiming Mr.Milken's alleged rigging of the junk-bond market causedinvestors large losses. It also settles allegations by theFederal Deposit Insurance Corp. that Mr. Milken, as head ofDrexel's junk-bond department, coaxed and bribed Sandamp;Lexecutives to buy risky bonds that contributed to thethrifts' collapse.   Why Mr. Milken decided to settle remains unclear. Neitherhis lawyers nor his public-relations firm would comment. Evenafter he pleaded guilty to what his lawyers called&quot;technical&quot; violations, the Milken team denied he was guiltyof any larger fraud. They reacted sharply to charges he hadcaused the Sandamp;L collapse, saying he was being made a scapegoatfor all the financial ills of the 1980s.   But the prospect of leaving jail with hundreds of lawsuitspending must have been strong incentive to settle. SaidMartin Auerbach, who represented money manager David Solomonin a Drexel-related suit, &quot;If spending that money {on thesettlement} can give him peace, that's the first step on theroad to recovery. . . . Anybody who walks away from the tablewith a half billion dollars -- that's not bad for a halfdecade of work.&quot;   While lawyers for all parties to the civil suits are saidto have agreed to basic terms, the settlement still needsformal approval from their clients. One obstacle might comefrom FDIC officials, who may feel political pressure toguarantee that Mr. Milken is disgorging as much of hisfortune as he says. It's not clear if Mr. Milken would allowdetailed disclosure of the financial statement to regulators.   Under the current terms, Mr. Milken will pay $190 millionin cash and $310 million from his Drexel employee-partnershipstake. Roughly $300 million more will come from thepartnership shares of former top Drexel officials PeterAckerman, Leon D. Black, Joshua S. Friedman, Lowell J.Milken, Marc H. Rapaport and Warren G. Trepp, individualsfamiliar with the negotiations said. Mr. Ackerman, once achief Milken deputy, is said to be paying a larger share thanany of the others.   Money from the settlement will go into a restitution fundfor investors who can show they were defrauded by thedefendants and into the U.S. Treasury, to help coversavings-and-loan bailout costs. In addition, Drexel's fixedcreditors will get 14% of recoveries against Mr. Milken as aresult of an earlier settlement. A notice that a settlementof $1.3 billion &quot;may be reached&quot; and that as much as $100million would go to Drexel fixed creditors was mailed tocreditors Friday. The creditors are set to vote by next weekon Drexel's bankruptcy reorganization plan.   Until recently, it appeared as if the hundreds ofDrexel-related suits would churn on for years in dozens ofcourts, keeping Mr. Milken buried in legal proceedings longafter his anticipated parole in 1994 or 1995 and delayingplaintiffs' lawyers' hoped-for paydays. But last December,Federal Judge Milton Pollack, overseeing some of the cases inNew York, called for a joint settlement of all suits anddragged the parties into negotiations.   A scheduled March 5 confirmation hearing on Drexel'sreorganization plan served as the catalyst for the talks. Ifthere had been no settlement, Mr. Milken would have pushedfor the right to vote as a creditor on the bankruptcyreorganization because he claims that Drexel owes him money.By voting against it, he might have disrupted the plan andcomplicated recovery for other creditors.   How much of his wealth Mr. Milken should be allowed tokeep was a central issue throughout the settlement talks,which ebbed and flowed until last week, when five days ofintense negotiations produced an agreement in principle onpivotal terms. The plaintiffs' lawyers insisted that anysettlement be expressed as a percentage of Mr. Milken's networth, which had been kept a closely guarded secret.   To facilitate talks, Mr. Milken's lawyers finallydisclosed that their client's family fortune had climbed to$1.6 billion by the late 1980s, and that he and his familyhad about $1 billion after his 1990 payments of $200 millionin criminal penalties and $400 million in a Securities andExchange Commission settlement.   The estimate of Milken wealth is said to include about$300 million in the names of Mr. Milken's immediate family.Also, a plaintiff's lawyer said Mr. Milken previously movedmoney to foundations outside the reach of the lawsuits.   But only Judge Pollack was permitted to see documentationof the net-worth claim, which the plaintiffs' lawyerschallenged as too low. With much of Mr. Milken's wealth tiedup in Drexel employee partnerships that often took stakes inDrexel deals, one major bone of contention was how to measurethe value of those assets. Most of the assets -- said toinclude warrants and other equity interests in Drexel deals-- don't trade. And lawyers ranging from criminal prosecutorsto the leading civil counsel have concluded only Mr. Milkenknows their true value.   The plaintiffs' side sought a guarantee from Mr. Milkenthat the partnerships were worth what he said. But the Milkencamp -- led by Arthur Liman of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Whartonandamp; Garrison, Stephen Kaufman of Williams andamp; Connolly, andMilken personal lawyer Richard Sandler -- wouldn't providesuch a guarantee. Talks nearly collapsed over the issue.   People familiar with the talks say the level of distrustwas particularly high because, at an earlier point, Mr.Milken apparently overvalued certain securities he waspledging as part of a previous version of the settlement. Hesaid the partnership assets, which included BCI HoldingsCorp., Storer Communications and Levitz Furniture Corp.securities, were worth $310 million. But when FDIC counselCravath, Swaine andamp; Moore asked Salomon Brothers to look at thesecurities they were told the value was more like $200million.   But Judge Pollack kept the talks alive last week byagreeing to appoint a monitor to set the value of the assets.If Mr. Milken's estimate is materially off, Judge Pollacktold the lawyers, he won't approve the settlement. Also, ifMr. Milken has hidden any assets, they may be forfeited, anindividual close to the talks said.   In the end, the FDIC's and investors' lawyers decided thatthe best guarantee would be to let Mr. Milken himself takeresponsibility for pulling full value from the partnershipassets and funneling them to the settlement fund over athree-year span. &quot;Milken thought, and I think he's right,that the government would be too inept&quot; to get the money fromthe partnerships, said Steve Andrews, attorney for formerDrexel salesman James Dahl. All the partnerships also will besubject to court oversight during the time the settlement isbeing paid, people familiar with the deal said.   Another important issue involved how Mr. Milken could beassured that he wouldn't be subject to future lawsuits evenafter all those pending were settled. The deal protects himagainst future government suits but not against new ones byindividuals or companies. The solution devised by JudgePollack was to hold back an indemnity fund of $50 millionfrom the settlement amount to cover suits that may yet befiled. But if that money runs out, which is not expected, Mr.Milken is &quot;on his own,&quot; according to an individual familiarwith the negotiations.   The tentative agreement was finally reached in Houston,where lawyers met last Thursday and Friday with JudgePollack, who was visiting there with his wife's family. In ascene reminiscent of hundreds of deal negotiations during thetakeover wars that Mr. Milken helped finance, a dozen lawyersfrom New York and Los Angeles took over a law firm'sconference rooms and wrangled over multimillion-dollar terms.   Feeding on pretzels, popcorn, chocolate-chip cookies andfruit, FDIC lead lawyers David Boies and Thomas Barr ofCravath worked in rare alliance with Melvyn Weiss, a captainof the plaintiff's bar who frequently sues Cravath clients.Mr. Weiss was overheard commenting that he would go to hisgrave smiling knowing that he had turned &quot;Tom Barr into aplaintiff's lawyer.&quot; Meanwhile, some of the lawyers commentedon Mr. Boies's cowboy boots, saying he was trying to emulateJoseph Jamail, the flamboyant Texas trial lawyer who hasconvinced juries to award hundreds of millions to defraudedinvestors.   The Milken settlement ultimately may prove a boon toallegedly defrauded investors, though they might not see anyof it for more than a year. Two committees of plaintiffs'lawyers are likely to spend months splitting up the moneyamong dozens of court cases around the country. Some of thelawyers, however, may get their cuts sooner.   The FDIC placed its legal fortunes in the hands ofCravath, a pricey corporate law firm that government agenciestypically can't afford. Partners there charge as much as $600an hour and take pride in running down -- and voluminouslydocumenting -- even the finest legal points. But this timethe FDIC cut an unusual fee deal under which Cravath agreedto charge $300 an hour for Mr. Barr and Mr. Boies, $225 to$250 an hour for its other partners and $180 an hour forassociates. Under the deal, once Cravath has recovered morethan $200 million, it gets to increase those ratesretroactively, providing a bonus of more than $20 million,according to an individual familiar with the fee deal.   As many as 50 lawyers filed additional lawsuits linked toDrexel and Mr. Milken, but Judge Pollack chose as leadcounsel two of the field's most veteran attorneys. They wereMr. Weiss of Milberg Weiss Bershad Specthrie andamp; Lerach andDavid Berger of Berger andamp; Montague in Philadephia. It'sunclear how much plaintiffs lawyers will get from thesettlement since their fees often have to be approved byjudges. But even at a reduced contingency rate of about 15%,their share probably would top $100 million.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          ATTORNEY Stephen Kaufman's lawfirm affiliation wasincorrectly stated in yesterday's edition.
