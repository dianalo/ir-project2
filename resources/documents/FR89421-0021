Dissenting Opinion</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background</ITAG>On September 1, 1988, the Board issued its Second Notice of Proposed Rulemaking(NPR II) (53 FR 33900), modifying in some respects the rule tentativelyproposed in its original Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) (52 FR 25142).Member Wilford W. Johansen dissented from the Board's decision to proceedwith rulemaking. For reasons set forth in NPR II (53 FR 33901), the Boardprovided for another period of comment on all aspects of the proposed rule;that period ended October 17, 1988.During this additional comment period, the Board received approximately1500 timely comments. A number of comments received through Congressionaloffices were copies of letters also sent directly to the Board. On March23, 1989, the Board met in open session to discuss further the issue ofappropriate bargaining units in the health care industry, and this FinalRule is the product of that open meeting. The Board is appreciative ofthe extensive interest shown by all segments of the health care industryduring this rulemaking proceeding, and has carefully considered the entirerecord during its deliberations. Though this Supplementary Informationcontains references to various comments submitted during this final phase,the Board wishes to emphasize now, as it did earlier (53 FR 33901), thatthese references are merely illustrative. The Board's decision has beenbased on the complete rulemaking record, including the transcript, thewitnesses' statements, all comments and briefs, and the exhibits, and notsolely on the testimony and comments referred to in NPR, NPR II, and thisSupplementary Information.Approximately 30 of the comments submitted during this final comment periodsupport the Board's proposal in whole or in part, and approximately 1465comments oppose it. Of the 1465 comments in opposition, approximately one-halfare form letters, for the most part containing brief arguments withoutsupporting detail.The most common form letter, submitted by over 600 correspondents, brieflyexhorts the Board to return to the case-by-case approach and to find appropriateonly two units, all professionals and all nonprofessionals, plus the statutorily-mandatedseparate unit of guards. Otherwise, say these commenters, their abilityto provide comprehensive, coordinated care would be adversely affected.An example of this form letter is that submitted by St. Luke's Hospitalin Bethlehem, Pennsylvania (Comment 434). The form letter contains blankspaces for such information as ``(name of organization)''; ``(number)''of health care facilities owned by the commenter; and ``(number)'' of employees;one submitted copy of the form letter did not have the blanks filled in.A second form letter, such as that submitted by St. Mary's Health Centerof St. Louis, Missouri (Comment 875), has been received from approximately35 commenters, and contains only four sentences. This letter also asksthe Board to abandon rulemaking and return to a case-by-case analysis,arguing that, in ways not specified, the rule will increase the risk oflife-threatening strikes and result in jurisdictional disputes, inefficientwork rules, and higher consumer costs.The other two most frequently submitted form letters are those receivedfrom the Humana chain and its affiliates; over 35 copies of these two formletters have been received. Illustrative of one type is that received fromHumana Hospital-Winn Parish (Comment 1474). This letter argues that theproposed rule fails to consider the differences in hospitals and specificcircumstances of employees at a time of dynamic change in the industry,could limit flexibility in dealing with personnel at a time this flexibilityis needed, and will result in increased costs at a time of growing demandfor cost containment. This letter urges the Board to continue a case-by-caseanalysis, arguing that the rule contravenes Congressional intent.The other Humana form letter was that submitted by Steven L. Durbin, VicePresident of Employee Relations/Education, Humana Inc. (Comment 905), whichmakes similar arguments but also gives various examples of duties nursesnow undertake (e.g. as inservice education, utilization review and dischargeplanning, or admissions), to show changes in the industry. The letter addsthat two proposed units, skilled maintenance and other professionals, wouldbe very small units. The letter argues that the Board's rationale in itsproposed rule has inconsistencies regarding salaries of nurses and uniformityin the industry. The letter further argues that the Board is abandoning<T3>St. Francis II</T3> (<T3>St. Francis Hospital</T3>, 271 NLRB 948 (1984)) to save time and resourcesfor itself and suggests other mechanisms for dealing with these problems.Of the remaining one-half of the comments which oppose the proposed rule,the vast majority make general arguments with little, if any, supportingdetail, and many contain portions of the form letters. The arguments inthese comments, which for the most part mirror those made during the earlierportions of the rulemaking proceeding, generally fall within the followingcategories:a. The health care industry is unfairly being singled out for rulemaking.b. Rulemaking is contrary to the language of section 9(b), requiring acase-by-case approach.c. The Board should follow the case-by-case approach of <T3>St. Francis II.</T3>d. The number of proposed units conflicts with the Congressional admonitionagainst proliferation.e. If the Board establishes units, there should be only two units, professionaland nonprofessional, plus guards.f. The proposal will lead to increased organizing by unions.g. Multiple units will result in strikes, repeated strike notices, jurisdictionaldisputes, and other disruptions of health care.h. Health care costs will substantially increase as a result of strikes,whipsawing, work rules, bargaining, and contract administration.i. Hospitals will lose needed flexibility.j. The Board did not consider the changes in the industry such as teams,and the differences between institutions and between employees.k. The particular units proposed, such as RN and skilled maintenance, areinappropriate.1. The implementation of the proposed rule will lead to increased litigation.m. At least 75 commenters argue that the Board should not treat small,rural hospitals as it does other acute care hospitals because they haveless money and staff flexibility, and more overlapping employee duties.Moreover, disruptions at these facilities would have a severe impact onproviding health care and employment for persons living in their areassince there are few or no other medical facilities nearby. Many of the75 commenters provide no further detail on this point.n. Several commenters embrace the arguments made by Member Johansen inhis dissent from the Board's decision to continue with rulemaking.o. Some commenters argue that the Board is inappropriately foreclosingdiscussion on bargaining unit issues by refusing to hear evidence on issuesconsidered during rulemaking.p. About 25 commenters argue that no rule should be made with less thana full five-member Board.q. Some commenters suggest that the Board consider alternative to a rule,such as a Board panel deciding health care cases.r. A few commenters argue that the implementation of the Board's proposedrule will expedite the Board's election process resulting, in insufficienttime for an employer to respond to a union's organizing campaign.s. Some comments criticize the extraordinary circumstances provision asbeing too narrow.The Board has carefully considered all the above arguments. Some (a, c,e, f, g, j, k, l, and n) were thoroughly dealt with in NPR and NPR II,and the Board believes that no further consideration or response is required.As to these arguments, the Board reaffirms the Supplementary Informationand rationale contained in NPR II, as well as pertinent parts of the originalNPR.The point made by the 25 commenters referred to in ``p'' is moot, sinceall five Board Members have participated in the consideration and promulgationof this Final Rule.With respect to the point made in ``r,'' it is the Board's expectationthat the rule will reduce what has hitherto been excessive delay and uncertaintyin determining the appropriate bargaining unit, but otherwise all the Board'snormal processes remain.With respect to the remaining arguments: argument ``b'' is considered atII; ``d'' at XIII; ``h'' at III; ``i'' at IV; ``m'' at VII; ``o'' at IIand XII; ``q'' at II; and ``s'' at XII.The Board acknowledges and has taken into consideration the numerical superiorityof the comments opposing the rule proposed in NPR II. From the beginningof this proceeding, employers have preferred continued use of the adjudicatoryapproach,\1\<NOTE/> and labor organizations have favored rulemaking. Since thereare many more hospitals than unions in the health care industry, the disparityin the number of comments is not surprising. Although there are exceptions,the comments are for the most part divided pro and con along employer-unionlines.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The Board in NPR II at 33929 stated, in the introductionto Section XIV on Specialized Hospitals, ``Some employers suggested thatthe Board make a separate rule for specialty hospitals, arguing that theyare neither acute care hospitals nor nursing homes * * *.'' Attorney RogerKing, among others, was cited, TR 4230-31. In Comment 1142, Bricker andamp;Eckler correctly points out that King's argument at the cited pages wasthat today's hospitals are varied and complex, and that rulemaking is ``notsuited for these institutions.'' The commenter is correct; throughout theseproceedings, King has opposed rulemaking in every form, for all institutions.However, the Board intended at the point in question merely to introducethe discussion as to whether specialty hospitals should be covered by therule; reference to a separate rule for such hospitals was inadvertent,and that possibility was not considered by the Board in NPR II. In fact,the Board excluded psychiatric hospitals from the proposed rule; it didnot make a separate rule for them. The misstatement about King's testimonyas to this point was immaterial to the Board's deliberations but is herebyacknowledged and corrected.We do not view our task as similar to that of a scale-master, weighingthe total body of comments for quantity without regard to substance. Insofaras we have found particular comments to be persuasive, we have reflectedthat in revisions to the rules previously proposed. To the extent we havefound comments to be unpersuasive, we have so indicated in these and previousSupplementary Information sections. The Board ``is not required to moldits decision to accord with the weight of the comments it receives.'' <T3>M.C.I. Telecommunications Corp.</T3> v. <T3>FCC</T3>, 675 F.2d 408, 415, n. 39 (D.C. Cir. 1982), cited with approvalin <T3>Telocator Network of America</T3> v. <T3>FCC</T3>, 691 F.2d 525, at 538 (D.C. Cir. 1985). Cf. <T3>Lloyd Noland Hospital andamp; Clinic </T3>v. <T3>Heckler</T3>, 762 F.2d 1561 (11th Cir. 1985).<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Rulemaking</ITAG>In both prior Notices, the Board set forth at considerable length the reasonsprompting it to embark on rulemaking to establish appropriate bargainingunits in the health care field. These reasons are set forth fully at 52FR 25143 through 25145, and 53 FR 33901 through 33904, and are still valid.Both the AFL-CIO (AFL) in its brief filed jointly with eleven other labororganizations (Comment 1713), and the American Hospital Association (AHA)in its brief (Comment 1711), deal at length with the Board's authorityunder section 9(b) to engage in rulemaking in the area of appropriate bargainingunits. See also Comment 1055, Eastern Hospital; Comment 1330, Taft, Stettiniusandamp; Hollister; Comment 1663, Labor Policy Association; and Comment 379,James T. O'Reilly (supporting), among others.Section 9(b) of the National Labor Relations Act requires the Board todecide ``in each case'' what the appropriate bargaining unit shall be.At the same time, section 6 gives the Board general authority to make rules,in the manner set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act, ``as may benecessary to carry out the provisions of this Act.''We have carefully examined the legislative history of these sections, particularlythat surrounding section 9(b), and find nothing to impugn the legitmacyof this rulemaking proceeding. The words ``in each case'' were added toS. 1958 by Secretary of Labor Perkins, along with a number of other changes,as ``small amendments'' to be ``made for the sake of clarity.'' I LegislativeHistory (1935) at 1442 (Hearing 3/12/35.) A later House version of thebill, HR 7978 (5/9/35), contained the ``in each case'' language (II LegislativeHistory at 2903), although earlier House bills had not. The House CommitteeReport, submitted by Representative Connery, stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">Section 9(b) provides that the Board shall determine whether, in orderto effectuate the policy of the bill (as expressed in sec. 1), the unitappropriate for the purposes of collective bargaining shall be the craftunit, plant unit, employer unit, or other unit. This matter is obviouslyone for determination in each individual case, and the only possible workablearrangement is to authorize the impartial governmental agency, the Board,to make that determination. There is a similar provision in the RailwayLabor Act of 1934 (sec. 2(9); 2(4)). [II Legislative History, supra, at2976.]</ITAG>The AFL suggests that the National Mediation Board (NMB), which administerssection 2(9) of the Railway Labor Act, has defined units in the airlineindustry on an industry-wide basis as the result of industry-wide proceedings.If that were so, it would seem clear, consistent with Congressman Connery'sanalogy, that the Board could decide units for an entire industry also.However, the cases cited by the AFL in its comment (p. 12, n. 18), arenot fully supportive of its position. Though the NMB has used industry-wideproceedings for bargaining unit determinations in the airline industry,its pronouncements in each of the six proceedings that have been calledto our attention have been limited to the particular airline involved.For the reasons set forth in the NPR and NPR II, including the virtuallyunanimous views of courts, scholars such as Kenneth Culp Davis, and manyother experts, we believe that our use of our rulemaking authority in thisarea is well within our discretion. In addition to the reasons previouslygiven, we note that the Board has long made use of ``rules'' of generalapplicability to determine appropriate units, for example: (1) That singlefacility units are presumptively appropriate. <T3>Haag Drug Company, Inc.</T3>, 169 NLRB 877 (1968). See also <T3>NLRB </T3>v. <T3>New Enterprise Stone andamp; Lime Co</T3>., 413 F.2d 117 (3d Cir. 1969);(2) that residual units are not separately appropriate when sought by anincumbent. <T3>The Budd Co</T3>., 154 NLRB 421 (1965); (3) that plant clericals andoffice clericals do not constitute an appropriate unit absent agreementof the parties. <T3>The Kroger Co</T3>., 204 NLRB 1055 (1973); <T3>Robbin andamp; Myers, Inc</T3>., 144 NLRB 295 (1963); (4) that the appropriateunit in decertification elections is the certified or recognized unit.<T3>Campbell Soup Co</T3>., 111 NLRB 234 (1955). See also the ``rules''described in <T3>Otis Hospital</T3>, 219 NLRB 164, 166 (1975), pertaining to the appropriatenessof residual units in the health care industry.We are aware of no judicial criticism of the Board's longstanding use of``rules'' in the appropriate bargaining unit area, and the Supreme Courtin <T3>NLRB</T3> v. <T3>Wyman-Gordon Co</T3>., 394 U.S. 759 (1969), strongly suggested that,when it promulgated ``rules,'' the Board would be better advised to utilizeits rulemaking powers under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). TheSupreme Court similarly endorsed the Board's use of its rulemaking powersin <T3>NLRB </T3>v. <T3>Metropolitan Life Insurance Company</T3>, 380 U.S. 438 (1965), at 444,n. 6, when, in remanding a bargaining unit case to the Board, the Courtstated:<ITAG tagnum="21">Of course, the Board may articulate the basis of its order by referenceto other decisions or its general policies laid down in its rules and itsannual reports, reflecting its ``cumulative experience,'' so long as thebasis of the Board's action, in whatever manner the Board chooses to formulateit, meets the criteria for judicial review. (Citations omitted.)</ITAG>There is nothing inconsistent between section 9(b) and the Board's useof its APA rulemaking power. Section 9(b) requires the Board to decidethe appropriate unit in each case, and the Board will continue to do sounder this rule. Should the parties not agree on the appropriate unit,a hearing in each case will still be directed, with the Board ultimatelyrendering a decision on the appropriate unit applicable to that particularpetition and that particular employer's operation. The Board may rely ona rule properly promulgated under the APA just as it has, since 1935, reliedon rules formulated under adjudication. The Supreme Court said as muchin a recent case arising under the Social Security Act. That Act, likethe NLRA, requires determinations (of disability) to be made on an individualbasis, after hearings, if the issue is in dispute. Because of similaritiesbetween cases, the Secretary of Health and Human Services promulgated,through rulemaking, a grid or matrix, through which it could be determined,with considerable predictability and uniformity, whether disability ina particular case existed. In <T3>Heckler</T3> v. <T3>Campbell</T3>, 461 U.S. 458, 467 (1983), the Court stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">We do not think that the Secretary's reliance on medical-vocationalguideline is inconsistent with the Social Security Act. It is true thatthe statutory scheme contemplates that disability hearings will be individualizeddeterminations based on evidence adduced at a hearing. See 42 U.S.C. sec.423(d)(2)(A) (specifying consideration of each individual's condition);42 U.S.C. sec. 405(b) (1976 ed., Supp. V) (disability determination tobe based on evidence adduced at hearing). But this does not bar the Secretaryfrom relying on rulemaking to resolve certain classes of issues. The Courthas recognized that even where an agency's enabling statute expressly requiresit to hold a hearing, the agency may rely on its rulemaking authority todetermine issues that do not require case-by-case consideration. See <T3>FPC </T3>v. <T3>Texaco Inc</T3>., 377 U.S. 33, 41-44 (1964); <T3>United States </T3>v. <T3>Storer Broadcasting Co</T3>., 351 U.S. 192, 205 (1956). A contraryholding would require the agency continually to relitigate issues thatmay be established fairly and efficiently in a single rulemaking proceeding.See <T3>FPC </T3>v. <T3>Texaco Inc</T3>., <T3>supra</T3>, at 44.\2\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ In <T3>Heckler</T3>, the Court noted that, at the statutorily-required ``hearing,''the claimants would be given ``ample opportunity both to present evidencerelating to their own abilities and to offer evidence that the guidelinesdo not apply to them (footnote omitted).'' [Id. at 467.] Similarly, here,if the parties do not execute one of the Board's stipulated or consentagreement forms, and the petition is not dismissed for administrative reasons,there will be the hearing required by section 9(c) of the Act. At the hearing,the facility being organized, or the union, will be given ample opportunityto demonstrate that the unit guidelines are not applicable to it for suchreasons as (a) the facility is not a hospital; (b) insufficient numbersof its patients receive acute care; (c) it is primarily a nursing home;(d) it is primarily a psychiatric hospital; (e) it is primarily a rehabilitationhospital; (f) its situation presents ``extraordinary circumstances''; etc.<ITAG tagnum="28">Moreover, we note that, under section 9(c) of the NLRA, the ``hearing''requirement is not specifically related to the appropriate unit question,but rather, more generally, to whether a question concerning representationexists. Thus, although now the Board will in most cases render a decisionon one subsidiary issue_the scope of the appropriate unit_on the basisof this rule, the Board will resolve other issues, such as whether a contractbar exists, whether certain employees are supervisory or managerial, whetherthe petitioner is a labor organization or has a conflict of interest, whethera single facility unit is appropriate, the composition of the appropriateunit, etc., on the basis of testimony taken at the hearing. The Board hasmerely determined that the issue of the scope of the appropriate unit withinan acute care hospital does not generally require adjudicatory consideration,and that otherwise it would have ``continually to relitigate issues thatmay be established fairly and efficiently in a single rulemaking proceeding.''</ITAG><T3>Heckler</T3> v. <T3>Campbell</T3>, supra at 467.As indicated, some of the form letters, as well as Comment 884a, submittedby Martha Jefferson Hospital, Comment 1049 submitted by Vanderbilt UniversitySchool of Nursing, and Comment 905, by Humana Inc., suggest as an alternativethat the Board establish special panels ``in the Regions and Washingtonto hear, decide and resolve health care bargaining unit issues.'' Thisis neither feasible nor helpful. Only the Board members themselves canresolve contested cases, including unit issues. <T3>KFC National Mgmt. Corp </T3>v. <T3>NLRB, </T3>497 F.2d 298 (2d Cir. 1974). The Board normally decidesrepresentation cases (as well as other cases) by panels of three members,and to create a permanent panel of three would not be likely to improveefficiency, and instead might result in delay. Moreover, it would unjustifiablyexclude the other two members. Because of the volume of cases before it,the Board simply cannot hear oral arguments except in very unusual cases,and we are aware of no useful purpose that would be served by sending Boardmembers to regional offices to decide health care cases. Sitting in thelocale of the contested case would not add to the members' understandingof the case.Some commenters suggest the use of rebuttable presumptions. The Board haspreviously rejected that suggestion, for the reasons set forth in NPR at52 FR 25145. The Board's experience since 1974 is that painstaking elicitationand examination of the facts of each individual case is, absent extraordinarycircumstances, neither helpful nor outcome determinative as to the scopeof the appropriate unit. See NLRB Exhibit 5, revised, referred to in NPRII at 53 FR 33903. The use of mere presumptions would not eliminate theduplicative litigation referred to by the Supreme Court in <T3>Heckler </T3>v. <T3>Campbell, </T3>but establishing units by rulemaking will go a longway towards accomplishing that objective.Finally, although we are highly satisfied with this rulemaking proceedingboth because of the large amount of valuable information it has given usand because, based on that information, we are confident we have movedtowards eliminating much of the unnecessary uncertainty existing in thisarea, we are under no illusions that the answers we now provide will necessarilysolve all health care unit problems, for all time. This is our first venturein major, substantive rulemaking. At some future date, after the rule hashad a fair trial, it may be appropriate to reexamine the rule to determinehow well it has worked, whether new developments have changed our underlyingassumptions and require different conclusions, and whether some other provisionsmight improve those now promulgated.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Cost Considerations</ITAG>Strikes and strike costs were dealt with at some length in NPR II. (53FR 33908-33910.) Though the comments following NPR II did not challengethe Board's finding there that the incidence of strike activity in thehealth care industry has been lower than in all other industries (53 FR33908), industry commenters identify approximately 20 strikes that havetaken place. A number of employers report that they have experienced onestrike (e.g., Comment 1708, Ellis Hospital; Comment 1718b, Waterbury HospitalHealth Center; Comment 1654, Pottsville Hospital and Warne Clinic; etc.).Two commenters report multiple strikes (Comment 1145, East Liverpool CityHospital, four in 20 years; Comment 1249, Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital,two strikes in last 8 years totalling 70 days plus four 10-day strike notices).The evidence in NPR II showed that sympathy strikes in hospitals have beenvirtually nonexistent. (53 FR 33909.) Nonetheless, two hospitals now reportsympathy strikes. (Comments 1259 and 1729b, Bridgeport Hospital, regardingWaterbury Hospital; Comment 516, Saint Elizabeth Medical Center (sympathystrike by delivery drivers at unnamed hospital).)The strikes reported in the aforementioned comments are insufficient innumber or character to conflict with the Board's prior conclusions in NPRand NPR II.A few hospitals discuss costs relating to their strikes. For example, inComment 981, O'Bleness Memorial Hospital reports spending $20,000 for securityforces and over $20,000 for legal and negotiating fees; two of the threetimes the hospital renegotiated its contract, the union issued a strikenotice and the hospital incurred costs in strike preparation. PottsvilleHospital and Warne Clinic reports $20,000 in legal fees and staff time(Comment 1654). The only cost amounts we regard as possibly noteworthyinvolve Wadley Regional Medical Center and Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital.In Comment 937, Wadley states that, in 1978, its costs for a strike were``up to $1,000,000.'' Santa Rosa, in Comment 1249, reports its labor relationscosts relating to two strikes, four strike notices, and three organizingcampaigns, were ``up to 5 million.'' In both instances, and in the absenceof elaboration, the hospitals' use of the phrase ``up to'' leads us tobelieve that the amounts given are only upper-limit estimates and not carefulcalculations. Nor is there any indication whether these costs were largelywage increases, legal fees, lost revenues, overtime, remuneration of strikerreplacements, or even lost profits. Legal fees are, of course, highly individual.Where cost estimates include staff time, it is not clear how much of thestaff's time was ordinary expense precommitted to be paid regardless ofwhether there was a strike. See, e.g., Comment 1654, Pottsville. In anyevent, the costs of the small number of strikes mentioned do not seem disproportionateto what we believe Congress must have anticipated when it authorized collectivebargaining in the health care industry by placing it under the Board'sjurisdiction in 1974.Approximately twelve commenters provided information regarding costs ofbargaining. For example, in Comment 1684, MonVale Health Resources, Inc.reports it spent $40,000 in the last negotiations with its nonprofessionalunit and $6,000 for arbitration. In Comment 1714, Gerald Champion MemorialHospital reports $16,000 for each of its negotiations. In Comment 1143,Lakeland Hospital estimates the cost from its one nonprofessional unitas $15,000 to $25,000. In Comment 1476, Brookhaven Memorial Hospital reportsthe cost of one unit's organizing campaign as 24 days of hearings and lostproductivity, and $80,000 in legal fees. It is the Board's expectationthat its promulgation of this rule establishing appropriate bargainingunits will render lengthy scope-of-unit hearings unnecessary and to thatextent some costs, such as legal fees, will therefore diminish. In anyevent, it would not be suitable for the Board to reject appropriate bargainingunits on the basis that the very things sought by collective bargaining_negotiatingand grievance processing_can be obtained only at some financial cost. Thestatutory amendments enacted by Congress in 1974 represented an implicitpolicy decision that collective bargaining in the health care industrywill produce countervailing benefits justifying the cost.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Employer Flexibility</ITAG>Four commenters take particular issue with the Board's reasoning that rulemakinghas no logical connection with an employer's continuing ability to respondflexibly to changing needs of the times. (53 FR 33904; see also 53 FR 33910)Martha Jefferson Hospital (Comment 884A) argues that employees will resistchange by seeking to join one of the units deemed appropriate. That argumenthas no support in the facts adduced during this proceeding; there has beenno showing that unions have resisted changed job duties. Moreover, logically,the argument, if valid, would apply to some extent regardless of what unitsthe Board finds appropriate, and regardless of the method the Board utilizesto determine the scope of appropriate units. It is true that union organizationdoes lead to the requirement that employers bargain before making changesin wages, hours, and working conditions, but that is an obligation imposedupon all employers by the NLRA, and we have no basis upon which to exempthealth care employers from these requirements. There has been no demonstrationof undue resistance to change by health care unions.The University of New Mexico Hospital (Comment 1022) suggests that jurisdictionaldisputes may arise but offers no examples to support its speculation; fewif any were offered in the earlier stages of this proceeding either. (53FR 33909). Based on the evidence presented to us, we conclude that jurisdictionaldisputes are infrequent in the health care industry generally. If suchdisputes were to arise, section 10(k) of the Act would be available toassist in resolving them. Moreover, if there were several units in a facility,it is possible they would be represented by the same labor organization,which might work things out by itself.Allegheny Health Services (Comment 1094) reasons that implementing a hospital-widefitness policy, for example, including drug testing, would be more difficultor even impossible if bargaining had to be held with eight separate units.Even if that is true, the evidence shows that, at least in the past, veryseldom have hospitals had more than two or three units. (52 FR 33933.)Moreover, though no specific evidence was offered on this point, we suspectthat other hospital-wide policies, such as holiday and vacation schedules,cafeteria benefits, parking privileges, etc., are uniform at many hospitalsdespite the presence of several units. Lastly, if one is to speculate,it could be argued with equal logic that an employer might have bettersuccess in negotiating a new plan with one small unit's representative,implementing that, and later using it as precedent for changes elsewhere,than it would in negotiating a new plan with a single labor organizationrepresenting many types of employees with diverse interests.Taft, Stettinius andamp; Hollister (Comment 1330) refers to a proposal bythe American Medical Association for a new classification, RCT (registeredcare technician), in which employees could move up from aide to LPN toRN as they received additional training. Taft, Stettinius argues that,under the Board's proposed rule, employees within the RCT classificationwould be in three different units and therefore hospitals will lose flexibilityin using RCTs. However, insofar as employees are in fact aides, LPNs andRNs, they are, for reasons set forth in NPR and NPR II, entitled to bein separate units, and creating a new generic classification of RCT doesnot change that fact. Nor would any RCT be in more than one unit at a time,even though he or she might, over time, progress from one unit to another.In any event, at this time the development and implementation of the RCTclassification is speculative. Taft, Stettinius' additional comment thathospitals would have to structure their staffs to conform to the proposedrule is supported neither by evidence nor reason. Physicians will stillpractice their specialty, as will RNs, technicals, etc. Nothing in therule precludes hospitals from structuring their operations as they seefit.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Common Expiration Dates</ITAG>In NPR II, the Board noted that ``hospitals have not generally sought commonexpiration dates, which would be a possible solution to recurring nearstrikes.'' (53 FR 33909) The AHA argues (Comment 1711) that ``common expirationof multiple contracts virtually would insure a complete cessation of operations,and, thus, is an illogical, unworkable goal for hospitals to pursue orfor the Board to use as support for its conclusions here.'' See also Comment987, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, which suggests that the Board shouldnot criticize the health care industry for not availing itself of commonexpiration dates because there have been crippling strikes in New York,Minneapolis, and San Francisco as a result of the strategy of common expirationdates.We accept the criticism of these commenters, but their argument provestoo much. Simultaneous strikes that may occur on the occasion of commonexpiration dates would seem to support more rather than fewer units. Anobvious charcteristic of a large bargaining unit would be that all employees'no-strike obligations would expire at the same time, and bargaining forthe entire unit would take place at the same time. Although a small unit'swork stoppage may not shut down the entire facility, a large unit's stoppagesurely will. This point was made in NPR II, at 33909; see also <T3>Manor Healthcare Corp</T3>., 285 NLRB No. 31 (1987), slip op. at 13,where the Board pointed out that ``an employerwide unit in this situationwould tend to broaden a given dispute and increase the potential for disruptionof patient care.''<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. The Units</ITAG>Surprisingly few comments offered additional facts which would be helpfulto the Board in making a final decision with regard to the appropriatenessof particular bargaining units.Some additional information on teams was proffered, but the Board reaffirmsits earlier conclusion as to the limited relevance of the so-called ``teamapproach.'' See NPR II 33907; 33913. A few commenters state they have teams,like discharge planning, but do not detail interaction or demonstrate whyseparate units would prevent use of teams. One commenter, Bethesda NorthHospital (Comment 1303), acknowledges that each discipline retains itsparticular area of accountability, but argues that ``it is vital to theprogress of the patient that they each understand and can cross over intoeach other's area * * *.'' See also Comment 1044, Missouri Hospital Association,which emphasizes that the Board has conceded the existence of teams, howeverwidespread they may be.On a related point, several commenters give examples of cross training.Comment 586, Marshalltown Medical and Surgical Center, describes its practiceof having security guards work the switchboard and do maintenance work.However, such employees would necessarily be placed into the statutorily-mandatedseparate guard unit. Attached to Comment 586 is a newsletter from GeorgeE. Speese, a Human Resource Development consultant, who describes how anEast Oregon hospital assigned switchboard duties to a ``radiology tech,''and how a Philadelphia hospital assigned nursing unit clerical duties toa phlebotomist. Similarly, Comment 1053, La Grange, states that certainnon-unit jobs were performed by unit employees (dietary employees performedsome outside maintenance duties, certified nurses' assistants performedsome clerical duties, etc.). In such situations, La Grange argues, theBoard's proposed rule would require it to carve out skilled maintenanceand clerical functions into separate units. However, this argument is basedon a misunderstanding of Board unit determinations as well as of the provisionsand purposes of the rule. Board unit determinations do not require thatcertain types of work be assigned to any particular unit. To the contrary,employers are free to make whatever work assignments they wish, subjectof course to their obligation to bargain before making any changes in workingconditions. Where one employee is assigned functions relating to more thanone unit, he or she is a ``dual function'' employee, and, upon request,the Board will determine the unit placement of such employee. See, e.g.,<T3>Otasco, Inc., </T3>278 NLRB 376 (1986); <T3>Oxford Chemicals, Inc., </T3>286 NLRB No. 13 (1987). In neither ofthe cited cases did the Board impose any restrictions on the employer'smaking cross-unit assignments; neither has the Board imposed such restrictionsin any other case of which we are aware.La Grange's comment also refers to medical technicians' being trained inat least 3 areas, including hematology, bacteriology, and histology. Thiscomment is consistent with the observation of NPR II that ``the majorityof cross-training that occurs is among the technical categories themselves.''NPR II at 33919.Comment 1081, Wausau Hospital Center, discusses product line management.Employees have to work together, and sometimes are even supervised by anindividual who may not be their direct line supervisor. The comment statesthat the Board misunderstands this concept and that multiple bargainingunits jeopardize this program. As with cross-training, discussed above,this commenter does not explain how the Board's unit determinations wouldin any manner inhibit product-line management.A small amount of additional information was offered as to the proposedseparate RN unit. See Comment 1026, by Spelman Memorial Hospital, that,with 128 beds, RNs report to the same administrator as lab technologistsand physical therapists. Moreover, RNs work in medical records along withother professionals. Comment 1330, Taft, Stettinius andamp; Hollister, assertsthat RNs are not unique, since other professionals also have direct andcontinuous patient interaction, etc. This comment concedes that RNs arethe ``hub'' of the professional administration of health care, but arguesthat to remove the hub and separate it from the spokes will cause the wagonto break down. Comment 1675, Middletown Regional Hospital, states thatsome of its nurses' former work is now done by social workers, and thatnurses at this hospital share the same pay system and pay, as well as somecommon first line supervision, with other professionals.The comment of Taft, Stettinius that all professionals interact with patients,fails to give sufficient weight to the adjective ``continuous.'' The uniquenessof the RNs' function in this regard was thoroughly dealt with in NPR IIat 33911, V, B, 2. The fact that in smaller hospitals there may be somecommon supervision does not cause us to reach a different result, particularlyin view of the very few examples presented.In Comment 1044, Missouri Hospital Association, through its attorneys,Spencer Fane Britt andamp; Browne, takes issue with the Board's observationin NPR II that nurse licensing exams are uniform throughout the country.However, at TR 3595-98, witness Faith Reierson described national licensingexams in considerable detail. The National Council of State Boards of Nursingconsists of the executive secretary and the members of the various nursingboards in the 50 states and 3 territories. Each of the states and territorieshas contracted with the National Council to provide that state or territory'slicensing examination for RNs and LPNs. The same test is administered twicea year on the same day at the same time (except for time zone variations)in each of the states and territories. No contrary testimony was introduced.On January 19, 1989, the Secretary of Health and Human Services made publicthe report of his Commission on Nursing. This Commission was an advisorypanel appointed to examine reports of a widespread shortage of registerednurses, and to make recommendations for resolving the shortage. We haveexamined the Commission's Report and find that it supports our observationsin NPR II concerning the nursing shortage, unique problems confrontingnurses, and the special need of nurses for their wage compression to bealleviated. In Comment 975, American Physical Therapy Association urges the Board tocreate a separate unit for physical therapists, in part because of theirseparate licensure. The practice of physical therapy is administered inalmost all jurisdictions by a separate board. The commenter represents,and it is undoubtedly true, that physical therapists have concerns peculiarto their speciality, such as interpretation of their practice act, privatepatient referral and access, home care extension services, and experimentalstructures for student clinical supervision. However, especially in viewof their relatively small numbers and their limited history of separatebargaining (in New York, largely), as well as the Board's desire to limitthe number of units unless there is strong justification presented in therulemaking record, the Board declines to establish a separate unit forphysical therapists. If found to be professionals, they are to be includedwith other non-RN and non-physician professionals. See NPR II at 33917-33918.The Board affirms the appropriate unit findings made in NPR II, for thereasons set forth therein, and except to the extent modified in this FinalRule and accompanying Supplementary Information. <ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Small Units </ITAG>A number of commenters argue that the proposed ``skilled maintenance''and ``other professional'' units, in particular, may be too small for collectivebargaining purposes. See, e.g., Comment 1686, American Society for PersonnelAdministration, which represents that skilled maintenance frequently constitutesless than 2% of the workforce. See also, generally, Comment 905, Humana;Comment 562, The Methodist Hospitals (Indiana); Comment 1021, St. Elizabeth'sHospital; Comment 1044, Missouri Hospital Association; and Comment 1330,Taft, Stettinius andamp; Hollister. Blanchard Valley Hospital (Comment 369),referred specifically to excessive administrative costs that may be associatedwith negotiations for very small units. We recognize the possibility that some skilled maintenance units will berelatively small, as will some ``other professional'' units and some physicians'units. The same point has been made with respect to rural hospitals, whosesmall employee complements may also lead to very small units.\3\<NOTE/> St. Vincent Hospital (Comment 1691) argues that a CoronadoHospital with 105 beds, there would be bargaining units of 1-2 persons.In Comment 1044, Missouri Hospital Association hypothesizes that in a hospitalof 20 beds, there might be more units than patients. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Parenthetically, we noted that a large number of smallrural hospitals call attention to their precarious financial condition.Comment 333, Holy Rosary Medical Center; Comment 1300, Bowie Memorial Hospital;Comment 1307, United Hospital Center; Comment 1673, Grayson County Hospital;Comment 967, Northern Maine Medical Center; Comment 1700, Weston CountyMemorial Hospital and Manor; etc. We do not consider the financial conditionof rural or small hospitals relevant to a determination of appropriatebargaining units. We doubt this situation will frequently arise. For one thing, it is likelythis ``problem'' will be self-policing. Where the entire workforce is verysmall, we believe that even smaller sub-groups will seldom want separateunits; nor will unions be likely to organize such small units. Moreover,we note that under adjudication, the Board rarely if ever reached differentresults because of the size of facility. In only one case, to our knowledge\4\<NOTE/>, did the Board arguably reach a different result becauseof the number of employees involved. In <T3>Mt. Airy Psychiatric Center,</T3> 217 NLRB 802, 803 (1975), one ofthe earliest cases decided after the 1974 amendments, the Board includedtwo employees who <T3>arguably </T3>were technicals in the service and maintenance unit,since they were the only employees performing a ``technical'' function.Lastly, the Board did propose a 100-bed dividing line with fewer unitsfor small hospitals in the first NPR, but industry and labor organizationswere virtually unanimous in their opposition to it (53 FR 33927). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ But see also <T3>Extendicare of West Virginia, d/b/a St. Luke's Hospital, </T3>203 NLRB1232 (1973), which arose prior to the 1974 amendments. Despite the foregoing, and despite the improbability that the problem willfrequently arise, we agree that units of two or three employees, or ofsimilarly small numbers of employees, would in many cases be impracticallysmall, especially in the health care industry. Where so few employees areinvolved, it can be argued with some degree or persuasiveness that despitethe shared, unique concerns and backgrounds that would otherwise make theseparate units appropriate, these concerns are outweighed by concerns overdisproportionate, unjustified costs and undue proliferation of units. Wetherefore shall revise the rule to provide that a petitioned-for unit offive employees or fewer shall constitute an ``extraordinary circumstance''removing the case from strict application of the rule, and the Board willconsider by adjudication what the appropriate scope of the unit shouldbe.\5\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Though, based generally on our prior experience as wellas the evidence accumulated during this rulemaking proceeding, we havedecided that a unit of five of fewer employees automatically triggers the``extraordinary circumstances'' exception, we recognize that there is noineluctable logic in the number five, and that other situations may occurin which a party may contend that the number of employees in the petitioned-forunit, or other circumstances, may require deviation from strict applicationof the rule. Thus, the ``extraordinary circumstances'' exception remainsavailable (most commonly through an offer of proof_NPR II at 33933) forany party who wishes to argue for any reason that the rule should not beapplicable to its facility. At the same time, we reemphasize that we donot intend for the ``extraordinary circumstances'' exception to ``providean excuse, opportunity, or `loophole' for redundant or unnecessary litigation.''NPR II at 33932. The Board will not reconsider, under the ``extraordinarycircumstances'' exception, the arguments it has already rejected in thisexhaustive proceeding. We recognize that situations involving small units may vary. Thus, in somesituations, if the requested units were not deemed appropriate, the small,requested unit might have to be added to a vastly larger unit. On the otherhand, a requested unit falling within this extraordinary circumstancesexception might be considered in conjunction with one or more otherwiseappropriate units of approximately the same size. Requiring a combinationof these otherwise separately appropriate groupings may give rise to considerationsdifferent from those in the previous example. The Board will render appropriatedecisions through its adjudicatory processes when the extraordinary circumstanceprovision is invoked in this situation. This approach will allow us toexamine individual circumstances where justified, while eliminating unnecessarilyrepetitive litigation. <ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Equal Employment Considerations </ITAG>Comment 1098, Myerson andamp; Kuhn (position paper by Susan Warner), representsthat RN units are dominated by females, 95-98%; physicians are dominatedby males (primarily white), in one large medical center, 83%; technicalsare dominated by females, 72-78%, with less than 50% minorities; othernonprofessionals are dominated 90% by minorities; business office clericalsare predominantly female, and almost 50% white; and skilled maintenanceis 85% male, 75% white. This commenter observes that hospitals are subjectto Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and argues that the proposedrule will defeat hospitals' efforts to integrate their workforces and provideopportunities for minorities and women. Hospitals will be hampered by negotiationswith unions representing what are in effect segregated units, insuringthat these units remain segregated. She points particularly to seniorityand says most collective-bargaining agreements do not recognize seniorityfrom other units, thus impeding upward mobility. Warner's cover letterexpresses the opinion that this aspect has not been adequately exploredand requests that the Board extend the comment deadline for this purpose.Her remarks are echoed by Comment 1508, Thomas Jefferson University Hospital.This is a question that has previously concerned us also, and during thefirst round of hearings the Board's representative specifically asked,twice, for comments on this subject (see TR 5225, 5243), noting that former-MemberJenkins had raised the same question during the 1975 oral arguments heldshortly after passage of the amendments. Only two witnesses addressed the subject: Jerry Shea, SEIU's Director ofthe Health Care Division; and Cathy Schoen, consultant to SEIU and itsformer Research Director. Both testified at some length, answering questionsraised by management attorney Roger King. Schoen submitted a supplementalstatement addressing it further. SEIU has represented over a quarter millionworkers in the health care industry, through 80 separate locals. The testimony of Shea and Schoen was that ``balkanization,'' or rigid stratificationwithin classifications, with little upward mobility, has been characteristicof the entire health care industry, representing the attitude of most employersthat they would rather not lose a good worker and have not deemed it intheir interest to provide training for promotions to other classifications;this has been done for bureaucratic and not for nefarious or uncaring reasons.They testified that the medical ``model'' characteristically organizesaccess to positions through outside education and licensure certificationas opposed to, for instance, the apprenticeship model that operates inthe skilled trades. Schoen testified there is in effect a caste system, with employers preferringdepartmental seniority regardless of whether or not there is unionization,and that it has been unions that have attempted to break out of this system.(TR 5221 ff.) Frequently even with broad units there is departmental seniority.(TR 5242.) Some subgroups have successfully bargained for seniority acrossunit lines. (TR 5244-45.) In her Supplemental Comments, Schoen gives asexamples of these exceptional cases Mt. Sinai in Chicago, where SEIU securedhospital-wide seniority for business office clericals, as well as bumpingrights in the event of layoffs' and Cape Cod Hospital, where SEIU successfullynegotiated hospital-wide mapping of jobs according to skills and entrylevel requirements, so employees could better see mobility paths. Schoenalso notes the SEIU Local 250 contract for Kaiser in Northern California,covering 9,000 workers from service staff to pharmacists; there, seniorityand promotion accrue first by department, then by facility. Schoen concludesthat there ``is a narrow administrative orientation towards human potentialthat limits mobility_not the units in which workers choose to organize.''A footnote to Schoen's Supplemental Comment lists three studies on thissubject. Brief reference was made to this evidence in NPR II at 33910.In view of the Board's express invitation on the record for further evidenceon this subject, and the limited substantive response, the Board does notsee a need for additional discussion. Having considered the comments andthe record evidence on this issue, the Board affirms its prior conclusionthat the evidence fails to show that the units found appropriate will limitminorities' or women's opportunities for job advancement and security,and may possibly have the opposite effect. (53 FR 33910.)\6\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\In one adjudicated case, the Board adopted the conclusionof an administrative law judge that a bargaining unit limited to a cokedepartment continued to be separately appropriate even through one of theparties alluded to a formal consent decree (<T3>U.S. </T3>v. <T3>Allegheny-Ludlum Industries, </T3>63 F.R.D. 1 [N.D. Ala. 1974], affd.517 F.2d 826 [5th Cir. 1975], cert. den. 425 U.S. 944 [1976]), the primaryobjective of which was to create transfer opportunities so that employeesin departments like the coke department could move into other departmentswith higher skills. The purpose of the consent decree was to alleviatepast alleged discrimination on the basis of race, sex, color, and nationalorigin. As indicated, the Board found accretion was not appropriate, despitethe existence of the consent decree. <T3>Armco, Inc. </T3>279 NLRB 1184 at 1184, 1214-15, 1218-19 (1986). <ITAG tagnum="84">IX. Coverage of the Rule </ITAG>Though not objecting to the Board's exclusion of nursing homes from theproposed rule, the AFL objects to the Board's summation of the evidence(NPR II, Section XII, at 33927-29), suggesting that the Board's conclusionsmight not be accurate and might prejudice future rulemaking by referringto lack of uniformity among nursing homes. Though we agree that our informationas to nursing homes has been limited, we do not agree that this part ofthe prior Supplementary Information will in any way prejudice future proceedingsthat might involve nursing homes. Such proceedings would be based on evidencepresented herein. Only one commenter would include psychiatric hospitals, Comment 322, Unionof American Physicians andamp; Dentists. That suggestion was made not onthe basis of specific facts or arguments on the merits, but rather because,in view of the many instances of common ownership and interlocking directorates,it would allegedly be relatively simple for ``devious'' attorneys to makea given facility fit within an exclusion. We have no good reason to believethat parties will attempt to dupe the Board into thinking that an institutionis not what the facts make it out to be. In any event, such a remote possibilityis an insufficient reason for including a type of facility which the Boardfinds, for reasons explained in NPR II at 33929-30, should not be coveredby the proposed rule. We shall continue to exclude psychiatric hospitalsfrom coverage of the rule.\7\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\The same commenter requests the inclusion of non-acutecare facilities such as HMO's, for the same reason. We similarly rejectthis request. In NPR II, the Board noted that it did not have much evidence on rehabilitationhospitals and various other specialty facilities, and so these facilitieswere ``tentatively'' included. See NPR II at 33931. Those who had commentedhad argued that care was integrated, but did not urge special treatment.NPR II, Section XIV. New England Rehabilitation Hospital, Comment 952, represents that it issolely a rehabilitation facility, but that average patient stay has beendecreasing and last year was just under 30 days. It documents more completelythe integrated care required for comprehensive rehabilitation. For onething, as with psychiatric hospitals, RNs are not the primary facilitatorsof patient care, and are significantly outnumbered by other professionals.Teams are used not only for special situations, but carry out day-to-daytreatment for each and every patient. In all cases there is close integrationbetween the work of RNs and that of physicians, therapists, social workers,psychologists and dieticians. RNs are not left to themselves on off-shifts;therapies are conducted on weekends, and social workers meet with patientsand families evenings and weekends. Similar information is offered by Comment1273, The Rehab Hospital of York, which states that its occupational therapists,physical therapists, and speech therapists continuously collaborate withphysicians and RNs to develop and provide treatment for all patients. NewEngland Rehabilitation Hospital has 198 beds; The Rehab Hospital of York,250 employees. The most extensive comment addressing this issue was that submitted bySpecialty Hospital Group, part of National Medical Enterprises, Inc., Comment970. That group includes 53 freestanding psychiatric hospitals, 23 freestandingrehabilitation hospitals, 18 freestanding substance abuse treatment facilities,and 100 managed facilities of the three varieties. First, it describeshow AHA registers some hospitals as ``rehabilitation'' hospitals; averagelength of stay is not involved. Second, Congress exempts rehabilitationhospitals from Medicare's prospective payment system, and implementingregulations (42 CFR 4052) contain a specific, 7-part definition of a rehabilitationhospital. Rehabilitation hospitals may also be accredited by one of twobodies: Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO),under different standards from those applied to regular hospitals, or byCommission for Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF). Accreditationby JCAHO or CARF automatically satisfies six of the seven criteria constitutingthe definition for Medicare prospective payment exclusion purposes: Allexcept the requirement that, during the most recent 12-month reportingperiod, 75% of the inpatient population required intensive rehabilitativeservices for the treatment of one or more of certain specified conditions.Thus,exclusion of rehabilitation hospitals would be administratively feasible,claims this commenter.Specialty Hospital Group further points out that one of the accreditationstandards under the Medicare definition requires multidisciplinary care.Each patient must have at least three hours of physical or occupationaltherapy per day for Medicare to pay for the care as ``medically necessary'';therefore, it is argued, nurses are not the primary facilitators of carein rehabilitation hospitals. Moreover, for Medicare coverage to apply,rehabilitation hospitals' patients must be medically stable before theyare admitted. Thus, it appears that the level of acuity at rehabilitationhospitals is considerably lower, and generalizations about job classificationsand appropriate units at other types of hospitals may not apply.Specialty Hospital Group does not ask for exclusion of alcohol and drugabuse hospitals (if there are any), but for clarification of the rule tomake it clear that alcohol and drug abuse residential treatment facilitiesthat are not hospitals are not covered.The rule previously proposed covers only ``acute care hospitals.'' An acutecare hospital is defined as a ``short term care hospital in which the averagelength of patient stay is less than thirty days.'' It seems likely thatthe acute care definition would exclude many rehabilitation, as well asdrug and alcohol, facilities. Yet, if it is true, as New England RehabilitationHospital represents, that its average length of stay is now slightly below30 days, such a hospital would be covered by the rule previously proposed,as an acute care hospital.The Board has considered the comments submitted at this stage of the proceeding,pertaining to rehabilitation hospitals, and has decided that sufficientquestions have been raised about appropriate units at such facilities thatthe rule should not be applied to rehabilitation hospitals. Many of thereasons given by the Board in NPR II for the exclusion of psychiatric hospitals(NPR II at 33929-30) now appear applicable to rehabilitation hospitalsas well. Thus, for example, it appears that RNs may not be identifiableas the primary professional providers of patient care; RNs and other employeeclassifications function somewhat differently because patients are notas acutely sick as in other types of hospitals, and because different methodsof treatment appear required for rehabilitative care; and around-the-clockefforts may be more extensively required of all professional groups, andperhaps other employees as well. The Final Rule will not, therefore, coverrehabilitation facilities that have been accredited as such by either JCAHOor CARF, regardless of the average length of patient stay.With respect to inpatient drug and alcohol treatment centers, it is possiblethey would be excluded either by (a) the definition of ``acute care,''relating to length of patient stay; or (b) the new exclusion for rehabilitationhospitals generally. No case has been made for exclusion of all drug andalcohol treatment facilities as a class, and regardless of whether theyare hospitals. However, if particular drug and alcohol facilities are nothospitals, the rule is not intended to cover them. For purposes of clarificationwe have decided to include in the rule a definition of ``hospital,'' apartfrom the definition of ``acute care.'' The definition shall be that containedin the Medicare Act, currently to be found at 42 U.S.C. 1395x(e), as revised1988, and incorporated by reference in the Final Rule's definitions.<ITAG tagnum="84">X. Miscellaneous Problems</ITAG>(a) <T3>Definition of ``acute care.''</T3> AFL contends that use of the ``acutecare'' definition in NPR II might ``skew'' the average length of stay ifa hospital has a large number of long term beds or swing beds. AFL pointsout that AHA alternatively defines a ``short term'' hospital as one inwhich ``over 50 percent of all patients are admitted to units where theaverage length of stay is less than 30 days.'' In view of the very highpatient acuity level in hospitals today, we doubt that there would be manysituations in which a sufficient number of long-term days by a few patientswould skew the average. However, we agree with AFL that the Board's intentionmay be better realized by addition of the alternative definition. One long-termpatient in a small, otherwise acute care hospital should not serve to definethe character of the hospital. Accordingly, we shall revise the Final Ruleto encompass the alternative definition as well.(b) AFL suggests that parties may try to persuade the Board that, eventhough a facility is not ``primarily'' any one of the excluded types ofinstitutions, it still is not ``primarily'' an acute care hospital, perhapsbecause it has such a variety and/or multiplicity of other types of unitsit is not ``primarily acute care,'' but rather some other amalgam typeof institution. The concern of this commenter may be well placed. Manyof today's hospitals have a number of other types of units, such as outpatientclinics, nursing care units, etc., and the Board did not intend to excludesuch hospitals from coverage of the rule unless any one of the excludedancillary services predominated. Nor did the Board intend to permit a hospitalto argue successfully that since the number of its outpatient visitorsexceeded the number of its over-night (acute care) patients, it was notan acute care hospital, and therefore not subject to the rules. In orderthat there not be unintended litigation, we shall, in the Final Rule, deletethe initial reference to the primary purpose of the hospital.(c) AFL suggests that the Board establish a reference point for averagelength of stay, such as ``the most recent twelve months preceding receiptof a representation petition for which data its readily available.'' Wedoubt that, with respect to this issue, individual hospitals will substantiallyvary depending on which 12-month period is uitilized. However, for purposesof clarity, we shall revise the rule to encompass this suggestion.(d) AFL further suggests that, where a petition is filed under the rule,and a hospital claims not to meet the definition of ``short-term hospital,''the burden should be on the hospital to produce the evidence, since therecords would be in its sole control. The AFL is suggesting a <T3>Tropicana</T3>-type rule (<T3>Tropicana Products, Inc.,</T3> 122 NLRB 121 (1958)) for use in situationsin which a hospital does not come forth with the necessary information.We trust this will not prove to be a major concern, since in the normalcase it will be obvious whether a hospital is acute care or not; stipulationsshould usually be obtainable. However, in order to encourage the partyin sole possession of the records to cooperate, we shall amend the proposedrule to provide that, where the employer does not, after issuance of asubpoena, produce records sufficient for the Board to determine the facts,the Board may presume the employer is an ``acute care hospital.''(e) AFL urges the Board to reconsider and hold cases pending the effectivedate of the Final Rule. Alternatively, it urges the Board to use its newempirical knowledge and, for example, grant RN units even under the latestdispartiy of interests test. The same point is made, in more detail, byComment 1710, American Nurses Association (ANA). The Board has not heldcases pending the effective date of the Final Rule (see, e.g., <T3>Middletown Hospital Association,</T3> 291 NLRB No. 79 (Oct. 28, 1988)),although parties themselves may have refrained from bringing cases duringthis interim period; few have come to the Board since NPR II. Whateverthe merits of the AFL's suggestion, and that of ANA, it is now moot.(f) AFL suggests that, ``to make the rule consistent with the preamble,it should state that a unit may be combined when petitioned for by a union.This would preclude an employer from arguing that only a combination unitis appropriate.'' That is, of course, the intent of this provision of therule, as explained, with citations, in NPR II at 33932 (Sec. XIX, CombinedUnits). The longstanding principle of <T3>Morand Brothers Beverage Co.,</T3> 91 NLRB 409 (1950) (cited NPR IIat 33932) continues to apply, and we shall make the required addition tothe rule to clarify this point.<ITAG tagnum="84">XI. Placement Decisions</ITAG>Comment 1107, American Association of Nurse Anesthetists, asks for case-by-caseconsideration of whether certified nurse anesthetists properly belong inphysicians' units or RN units. Such consideration will, of course, continueto occur, as the Board implied in NPR (at 25146, noting that some day inthe future perhaps rulemaking would be utilized to determine unit composition),and NPR II (at 33926, stating ``The precise placement of particular classificationswhich may be disputed in a particular case, is, for the time being, leftto the case-by-case adjudicative approach.'')For the same reasons, we deny the request of American Society of ClinicalPathologists (Comment 1329) to clarify the rule to specify that ASCP-certifiedmedical lab technologists are to be included in ``other professional''units, and certified medical lab technicians are to be included in technicalunits. The Board in this rulemaking proceeding at the outset disclaimedany intention to determine placement issues (NPR at 25146), and it wouldbe inappropriate to deviate from this stated intention, even if the recordwere sufficiently complete to permit us to do so.<ITAG tagnum="84">XII. Extraordinary Circumstances</ITAG>AFL suggests that some of the limitations on the extraordinary circumstancesexception set forth in the Supplementary Information accompanying NPR II(Section XX at 33932-3) be incorporated into the Final Rule. AFL suggests,e.g., that the rule should provide:<ITAG tagnum="21">Extraordinary circumstances exist only where a hospital is shown tobe uniquely situated such that application of the rule would be accidentalor unjust. Variations among acute care hospitals that were considered bythe Board in promulgating this rule do not, alone or in combination, constitutean extraordinary circumstance.</ITAG>AFL also asks that the rule make it clear that multi-site units are notan exception. The Board has considered these suggestions, but fails tosee the necessary for including these matters in the Final Rule.Several commenters suggest that the extraordinary circumstances exceptionis so narrow as to be useless. AHA argues that, because of the narrownessof the exception, parties would be deprived of due process. (Comment 1711.)However, the case cited for that proposition, <T3>Jackson Water Works, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Public Utilities Comm.,</T3> 793 F.2d 1090, 1097 (9th Cir. 1986), merelystates as a general proposition that ``the due process clause guaranteesan aggrieved party the opportunity to present a case and have its meritsfairly judged (citations omitted). [S]ome form of `hearing' is requiredbefore a person is deprived of a protected property interest.'' Aside fromthe question whether a constitutionally-protected ``property'' interestis involved when the Board makes a unit determination in a representationproceeding, it is clear that the hearing required by section 9(a) of ourAct will continue to be available where the parties do not consent to anelection. Supra, Section II, and, specifically, n. 2. We note, coincidentally,that the majority in <T3>Jackson</T3> held that the state's eminent domain procedure was constitutional,even though it provided for no right of appellate review. See also Comment1330, Taft, Stettinius andamp; Hollister. Comment 1087, California Associationof Hospitals and Health Systems suggests that the extraordinary circumstancesexception is so narrow that its inclusion is ``a charade.''We do not agree with these commenters' characterizations. The purpose ofthe rulemaking procedure has been to gather a large amount of information,and then to set forth unit determinations consistent with the informationgathered, appropriate for collective bargaining purposes, and consistentwith the Board's obligations under the statute. The Board's experiencesince 1974, as documented in Board Exhibit 5, as amended, has been that,even under adjudication, with the facts of each individual case recitedin records of substantial length and expense, the Board has almost alwaysreached the same result. That being true, avoidance of unnecessary litigationin each case has been one goal of the rulemaking undertaking. The extraordinarycircumstances exception has had to be crafted in such a way as to satisfydue process by allowing for litigation where the circumstances warrant,i.e. are truly extraordinary_but at the same time precluding litigationwhere the arguments are merely repetition of matters already considered,such as the team approach, integration of functions, cross training, increasedspecialization, recent cost containment measures, etc.We have, in this SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION, provided specifically for one``extraordinary circumstance,'' viz. a requested unit of five employeesor fewer. There will undoubtedly be others, but we do not expect them tobe frequent. We find nothing inconsistent with due process in the ``extraordinarycircumstances'' exception crafted into the Final Rule. We reaffirm thescope of the extraordinary circumstances exception as set forth in NPRII.<ITAG tagnum="84">XIII. Proliferation</ITAG>A number of commenters dispute the Board's conclusions on proliferationin NPR II at 33933-94. Comment 1087, California Association of Hospitalsand Health Systems, takes issue with the Board's analysis in NPR II, thatCongress was concerned with patterns such as in newspaper and constructionindustries of fifteen or more units at a workplace. That commenter arguesthat Congress' failure to specify a number does not justify the Board'sspeculation that eight units would satisfy Congressional concern. Comment1330, Taft, Stettinius andamp; Hollister, contends that the Board erroneouslyanalyzed the legislative history. Taft, Stettinius believes that the partiesdid not reach a compromise whereby employers gave up statutory limitationson the number of units in return for stroke-restricting provisions; neitherdid unions win the right to use the five-unit specification as a floor.Comment 1686, American Society for Personnel Administration, contends thatno other industry has as many units as the Board has given in this proceeding.Comment 1711, AHA, argues that the Board errs in believing that Congressmerely wanted the Board to avoid patterning health care units after thenewspaper or construction industries, stating that this argument was rejectedby the Second Circuit in <T3>Mercy Hosp. Assn.,</T3> 606 F.2d 22, 27 (2d Circ. 1979), cert. den.445 U.S. 971 (1980), which said that even application of the normal industrialunit criteria could impede effective delivery of health care services.The subject of what Congress meant has been debated since 1974, with opinionsvarying from those expressed by the Board in NPR II, to those expressedby some courts as indicated above, to those expressed by Judge Edwardsin <T3>Electricial Workers IBEW Local 474 (St. Francis Hospital) </T3>v. <T3>NLRB,</T3> 814 F.2d 697 (D.C. Cir., 1987) to the effect that varyingexpressions of Congressional intent are not legally binding upon the Boardsince the statutory language was not changed.We are inclined to agree with Judge Edwards that, since section 9(a) wasnot changed in 1974, varying expressions by legislators on what they intendeddo not necessarily rise to a mandate requiring, for example, a disparityof interests standard.\8\<NOTE/> Contrary to the understanding of The American Society forPersonnel Administration, Comment 1686, it is not true that ``with thelimited exception of the construction industry, virtually no other industrycovered by the NLRA must cope with as many as eight bargaining units.''In industrial settings, there is the potential for far more than eightappropriate bargaining units.

In fact, based on our experience following the 1974 healthcare amendments, we anticipate that most of the organizing will occur inRN units, technical units, skilled maintenance units, service and unskilledmaintenance units, and, possibly, business office clerical units. Manyphysicians in hospitals are independent contractors, and there have beenonly one or two published cases involving separate physicians' units since1974 (NPR, 52 FR 25147; NPR II, 53 FR 33905). Although a separate guardunit is mandated by the Act, we have had few if any hospital guard unitcases, perhaps because some hospitals contract out their guard service.The unit of all-other professionals is also required by the Act, if, aswe have found, RNs and physicians constitute separate appropriate units;however, we have not had a large number of other professional units.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\32\ In Comment 1142, Bricker andamp; Eckler alleges that attorneyRoger King's testimony concerning other-professional units was taken outof context. It is alleged that King intended only to show that there wasvery little organizing among RNs in Ohio: i.e., such units exist in only16 of Ohio's 180 private hospitals. However, King also testified that,in Ohio, only one separate other-professional unit exists (NPR II at 33908).We believe that King's testimony does support the conclusion for whichit was cited, that, in Ohio, the existence of separate units of RNs hasnot led to similar, separate units of all other professionals.The original rulemaking record provided strong empirical support for allthe units ultimately proposed in NPR II. In addition to the other factorsmentioned in NPR II in support of the individual units, the separate labormarkets for the RNs, skilled maintenance employees, and business officeclericals favored separate representation for them. The legislative historyshowed ``proliferation'' was opposed by Congress because it was fearedthat would lead to numerous work stoppages, jurisdictional disputes, andwage whipsawing and leapfrogging. However, as was amply documented in NPRII, multiple units have not been shown to cause an unusual number of workstoppages, nor have they been shown to have caused jurisdictional disputes,wage whipsawing, or leapfrogging. Little additional evidence on these pointswas introduced during the current round of comments, except that severalcommenters expressed the view that, since there have never, or rarely,been eight bargaining units in the health care field, the Board's evidenceas to costs, strikes, bargaining success, and unionization is irrelevant.(See, e.g., Comment 1711, AHA; Comment 1081, Wausau Hospital. See alsoComment 1044, Missouri Hospital Association, which argues that early unitswere recognized voluntarily because, prior to 1974, it was known that individualunits could not strike.)We do not agree that the evidence acquired during this proceeding is irrelevant.For one thing, even under adjudication, whether strikes, whipsawing, orjurisdictional disputes will result if an initial organizational effortsucceeds carries with it a greater degree of speculativeness than is allegedhere; under adjudication of individual cases, no evidence whatever canbe adduced as to the facility under consideration, whereas, at least here,past experience in the industry generally can be and has been considered.The fact is that in the decade between 1974 and 1984 there were, generally,eight units recognized as appropriate under Board case law (including thestatutorily-mandated separate unit of guards.) Despite continual uncertaintyas to the proper standard, there was considerable organizational activity,and the evidence presented to us is that there were virtually none of thedisruptive consequences which concerned Congress during the 1974 debates.Comment 725, Greater Baltimore Medical Center, argues that, where thereare existing units, more than eight may ultimately be found appropriate.While that is a theoretical possibility because section 103.30(c) of therule technically removes such facilities from the literal reach of therule, section XV of NPR II refers to the principle of <T3>Levine Hospital of Hayward,</T3> 219 NLRB 327 (1975), which in effectprohibits residual or fractional units in health care facilities. The Boardin NPR II deferred this issue to adjudication. Our stated intention willbe, insofar as possible, to conform new units in such situations to theproposed rule.As for the question whether the units found appropriate are too many, orproliferative, we do not believe that that was a question Congress wishedus to answer in the abstract_as if, for example, ``x'' number of unitsare automatically proliferative, but ``y'' are not. Rather, we believeit has been incumbent upon us to carefully examine the exhaustive rulemakingrecord furnished by numerous parties from all sectors of the health careindustry, and then to make a determination on appropriate units consistentwith that evidence, consistent with our self-expressed desire to avoida proliferation of units, and consistent with a requirement that theseunits not be likely to produce the unwanted results of repeated work stoppages,jurisdictional disputes, wage whipsawing, and other related evils. We believewe have done so and, for that reason, conclude that our determination isnot unduly or reasonably proliferative in any meaningful usage of thatphrase.\33\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\33\ We note that our unit determinations in this proceedingare not inconsistent with those in the cases cited with approval in theSenate Committee Report (S. Rept. 93-766, 93d Cong., 2d sess. 5 [1974]).Thus, in <T3>Four Seasons Nursing Center of Joliet,</T3> 208 NLRB 403 (1974), theBoard found inappropriate a three-employee unskilled maintenance unit ina nursing home. Our rule does not cover nursing homes, and three-employeeunits are considered an ``extraordinary circumstance'' even in acute carehospitals. In addition, maintenance employees who primarily empty trash,replace light bulbs, and move furniture are included in service units.In <T3>Woodland Park Hospital,</T3> 205 NLRB 888 (1973), the Board declinedto find appropriate a separate unit of X-ray technicians. Our rule would,likewise, find inappropriate a separate unit of X-ray technicians. (TheBoard in <T3>Woodland</T3> did not have occasion to consider the appropriatenessof an all-technical unit, since no request for review was filed to theregional director's ruling on that issue.) Finally, in <T3>Extendicare of West Virginia, Inc., d/b/a St. Luke's Hospital,</T3>203 NLRB 1232 (1973), the Board found appropriate a separate unit of licensedpractical nurses, but included the seven remaining technicals with theservice and maintenance employees. Our rule would not find appropriatea separate unit of licensed practical nurses, who in prior Board caseshave been found to be technical employees, but would rather group all technicalemployees together in a separate unit.Our action in exempting units of five or fewer employees from the coverageof the rule is prompted by our concern about proliferation. Comments aboutthe effects of a number of small units in small hospitals convince us thatthey could pose a serious proliferation potential. It is for that reasonthat we have excepted these small units from coverage of the rule. We notethat the ``small unit'' exception is not limited to small hospitals. Itcould also have the effect of reducing the number of units in large healthcare institutions.In addition to the foregoing, we continue to believe that Congress wasconcerned with the Board's not repeating the pattern of bargaining in suchindustries as newspapers and construction, and affirm those additionalportions of NPR II which discuss this point.<ITAG tagnum="84">XIV. Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>No comments after NPR II addressed this issue. We reaffirm our prior certification.(53 FR 33934)<ITAG tagnum="84">XV. Dissenting Opinion</ITAG>Member Wilford W. Johansen dissents from establishing health care bargainingunits through a rulemaking procedure.In his view rulemaking in the health care industry is neither appropriatenor desirable, for several reasons.He believes the language of the Act itself forecloses rulemaking for particularunits. Section 9(b) of the Act requires that ``The Board <T3>shall </T3> decide <T3>in each case</T3>'' what the appropriate unit shall be, ``in orderto assure to employees the fullest freedom in exercising the rights guaranteedby'' the Act. Under basic rules of statutory construction, he reads thatlanguage as mandatory rather than permissive. He also believes that theBoard cannot satisfactorily fulfill its statutory obligation by relegatingthat specialized, decisional function to rulemaking procedures. Thus, whilerulemaking is a desirable and even a necessary portion of the Board's functionsin some areas, in his opinion, this is not one of those areas. It is importantto remember that Congress did <T3>not </T3>amend section 9 when it enacted the Health Care Amendmentsin 1974. If Congress had intended that the Board abandon its then almost40-year old decisional approach and instead embark on a wholly new procedurefor determining appropriate units in portions of the health care industry(and only in that industry) it surely would have said so explicitly. Itdid not do so; nor did it even implicitly suggest such action. The Board``rules'' referred to by the majority as grounds for this action (i.e.,<T3>Excelsior </T3> list, contract, bar, etc.) in his view simply do notsupport such a radical departure from well established precedent. Theywere themselves arrived at decisionally, and they did not involve unitdeterminations. Nor is he persuaded by reference to interpretation of differentfunctions by other agencies.Even assuming that abandoning the Board's decisional format for determiningthe appropriate unit in each case is a permissible exercise, however, hewould not deem rulemaking with regard to health care units to be eithernecessary or desirable.The disagreements between members of the Board or between one Board majorityand another, have focused on questions concerning the meaning of the statute,analysis of the legislative history, and the interpretation of Congress'intent. The differences between the Board and various courts of appealsand the conflicts among the courts of appeals have involved not only thosequestions which divided the Board, but also issues concerning the properscope of review, and the deference to be properly accorded to the Board'sreading and interpretation of the Act_the Board's primary function andresponsibility.The appropriate procedure to resolve questions surrounding Congress' intent,the proper scope of review, and the Board's duty and authority in the exerciseof its expertise under the statute, is to submit those questions to theSupreme Court, the final arbiter on issues of this nature. That is particularlytrue in this area, because the Board has received criticism from CircuitCourts at both ends of the spectrum. Most of the disagreement has centeredaround application of the traditional ``community of interest'' standardversus a separate ``disparity of interest'' test for evaluating appropriateunits in health care facilities. Different courts at different times haverejected each of these approaches. Thus, it seems especially appropriateto submit these issues to the Supreme Court to resolve the split in thecircuits. That process best serves the interests of the parties, the generalpublic, and the Board.Other factors make the establishment of particular health care units throughrulemaking at best inadvisable. Those courts that have deemed the Board'sapproach to health care units to be too rigid will continue to criticizesuch units established through rulemaking. And, because unit determinationsestablished by a predetermined set of rules are inherently less flexiblethan those arrived at by decision in specific cases, it must be anticipatedthat criticism by some courts will intensify; on the ground that a resultreached by the Board was not derived through application of its institutionalexpertise in a particular factual situation. Indeed, the Board must concedethe validity of at least some such criticism. That is so not only becausethe rules themselves are less flexible, but also because the nature ofthe evidence on which the rule is based is in turn more generalized_primarilyanecdotal and statistical_and, therefore, lacks the quality of pertinentevidence regarding a specific situation which lies at the core of the decisionalprocess.Another reason to reject the rule is the information which the Board hasobtained during this process. As a result of that experience, the Boardhas already seen fit to revise the proposed rules substantially. That factin itself is a compelling reason to retain the Board's traditional decisionalformat, even if it were not required.There have been considerable changes from one year to the next in thisproceeding. Nursing homes and rehabilitation hospitals have been exemptedfrom operation of the rule. The proposed ``100-bed'' distinction has beeneliminated, along with the separate unit configuration for small hospitals.Thus, the number of proposed units affecting small hospitals has changeddramatically; and the number of units in large (now all) acute hospitalshas been expanded by the addition of separate groupings for maintenance,and business office clerical employees. We do not know what will happennext year. Will the heavy burden of proof required under the ``extraordinarycircumstances'' proviso virtually preclude evidence that the units establishedin this proceeding make little practical sense in a particular case? Willthe Board need to indicate_again_that it might have proceeded differentlyif there had been more, or better, information when the rule was made?And, in that case, will the Board, the parties, and the public have toundergo another two year exercise in order to amend the rule to accordwith what the Board then knows (or believes it ``knows'')? Such uncertaintiesneither benefit the Board nor any other constitutency. Certainly they donot effectuate the purposes of the Act.For all these reasons, Member Johansen would vacate the notices of rulemakingand submit the issues to the Supreme Court for resolution.<ITAG tagnum="84"> List of Subjects in 29 CFR Part 103</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Labor management relations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Text</ITAG>For the reasons set forth at 52 FR 25142-25145 (through Section IV), andalso 53 FR 33900-33934, as supplemented and modified by this SupplementaryInformation, 29 CFR Part 103 is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 103_OTHER RULES </ITAG>1.
