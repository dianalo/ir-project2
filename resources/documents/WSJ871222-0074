The move reflects Mr. Trump's increasing frustration and disenchantment with managing Resorts as a public company. Unable to secure financing through Resorts for completion of the Taj Mahal casino, the company's intended crown jewel, Mr. Trump said he would be willing to invest his own money in the project if he owned Resorts outright. Furthermore, by taking the company private, he would eliminate the aggravation of answering to shareholders and making public disclosures.    &quot;Resorts can't get financing for the Taj Mahal, and I'm not going to use my own money if I own only a small part of the stock,&quot; explained Mr. Trump. &quot;I will put up my own money only if I own 100%.&quot;    In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange yesterday, Resorts' Class A stock closed at $13 a share, down $1.25.    Mr. Trump already owns about 585,000, or about 73%, of Resorts Class B common shares, which have 10 times the voting power of Class A shares. In addition, he has a $135-a-share tender offer pending for Resorts remaining 167,000 Class B shares. If the two tender offers are completed as expected, he will have purchased 100% equity interest in the Atlantic City, N.J.-based casino operator for about $185 million.    One of Mr. Trump's competitors in the bidding war for voting control of Resorts said he suspects the New York real estate developer has grown disillusioned with the purchase, which was viewed as an extravagant mistake by some industry officials.    Last month, discouraged by the outlook, Mr. Trump proposed selling his stake in Resorts to Dallas-based Pratt Hotel Corp., according to Chairman Jack E. Pratt Sr., who was repeatedly rebuffed by Resorts last year when he tried to acquire the company. Mr. Trump denies having made such an overture.    Mr. Pratt said Mr. Trump claimed to be &quot;tired&quot; of managing a public company, and was particularly discouraged by the Taj Mahal project.    The Taj Mahal, which is still under construction, has been plagued by cost overruns and delays. Last week, financing problems prompted the layoff of about 600 workers. Initially expected to cost about $185 million, Mr. Trump now is trying to reign it in at $930 million. What's more, the casino's doors won't open until next fall, missing the money-making summer crowds.    &quot;The cost of the Taj Mahal is like a runaway train,&quot; says Mr. Pratt. &quot;I wouldn't take it off his hands if he gave it to me.&quot;    Mr. Trump is sharply curtailing construction on the Taj Mahal and is threatening to suspend it indefinitely. He said he wants Resorts' Class A holders to tender their shares quickly so that he can start putting his own money into the project. If holders delay in tendering their shares, Mr. Trump said, &quot;I might withdraw the offer at any time.&quot;    For a while, Mr. Trump seemed to be on a roll. With his acquisition of a controlling interest in Resorts, Mr. Trump suddenly became the most powerful individual player in Atlantic City's gambling industry. He also owns two private properties in there -- Trump Plaza and Trump's Castle.    The Resorts purchase gave him four casinos in Atlantic City and much of the city's prime undeveloped land. But in recent weeks, conditions have soured.    &quot;The Trump name may be magic. But when it comes to the most expensive hotel in the world, does the cash still flow freely?&quot; asked Marvin B. Roffman, a gaming analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.    The stock market plunge isn't the only reason Mr. Trump is having trouble finding outside financing. Economic conditions in Atlantic City are sluggish. Growth of gaming revenues has dropped as more casinos have entered the market and others have expanded. For example, the total gross win for all Atlantic City casinos rose 10.2% in 1984 from a year earlier. But in 1985, the rise was only 9.6% and by 1986 the rate had eased to 6.7%, according to New Jersey Casino Control Commission data.    The Taj Mahal, which analysts say will need $1 million in daily gross wins just to break even, will be competing with 11 other casino properties for revenues at a time when the market is in a slump. </TEXT></DOC>
