We requested comments inlight of economic and demographic changes that have occurred since then.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ A commercial zone is the georgraphic area around a municipalitywithin which motor carrier operations may be performed exempt from regulationby the Commission. <T3>See </T3>49 U.S.C. 10526(b)(1). A terminal area is the geographic areawithin which exempt pickup and delivery operations may be performed inconnection with a motor carrier's regulated line-haul movement. See 49U.S.C. 10523. Terminal areas are coextensive with commercial zones of municipalitiescarriers may serve in their line-haul operations. <T3>See </T3>49 CFR 1049.1. Terminal areas for unincorporated communitiesare defined by the formula at 49 CFR 1049.2. A similar formula is usedto construe the scope of motor carrier operating authority to serve unincorporatedareas. See 49 CFR 1041.21.After reviewing the comments received, we now propose to amend the population-mileageformula by reducing the number of population categories into which citiesare grouped (see 49 CFR 1048.101(c)(1)-(7)), and by increasing the mileagemeasurement for each population category, so that all municipalities willhave larger zones than under the existing formula. In the ANPR, we proposedthe following formula:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,8</C> <H1>Population</H1><H1>Miles</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Under 100,000<D>15</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">100,000-499,999<D>25</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">500,000-1,000,000<D>40</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Over 1,000,000<D>50</D></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Commentors favoring zone expansion state that this formula is reasonable,while interests opposed to zone expansion believe it describes zones thatare too broad. We propose to adopt a formula that is at least as broadas that proposed in the ANPR. We request comments on whether the ANPR formulais too narrow, and whether there should be fewer or more categories ofcities by population. Commentors are invited to submit any suggestionsthey might have as to what the formula should be, giving specific reasons.Commentors should specifically address the criteria traditionally usedto determine commercial zones, and any other factors they believe to berelevant.We also propose to replace the formula at 49 CFR 1049.2 for terminal areasat unincorporated communities with a rule that provides that terminal areasat unincorporated communities shall extend 15 miles from their centralpost offices. For the sake of uniformity, we propose to revise the ruleof construction for motor carrier operating authority to serve a particularunincorporated area (49 CFR 1041.21) to comport with the terminal arearegulations by adopting a similar 15-mile rule instead of the current formula.Commentors are invited to address these aspects of our proposal.Adoption of a revised population-mileage formula may eliminate the needfor the specifically defined zones now set forth in 49 CFR 1048.1 <T3>et seq.</T3> However, it is not our intention to reduce the size ofany existing zones. We request interested parties to advise us if areaswithin any of the current specifically defined zones would not be includedwithin the commercial zone of the base municipality if its zone were definedby the formula proposed above. We will specifically define such zones toensure that all areas within current zones are in the new zones. Of course,we will continue to permit interested parties to petition the Commissionfor redefinition of any commercial zone that is not adequately definedby the population-mileage formula.The proposed expansion of the commercial zones and terminal area exemptionswould apply to both motor carriers of property and motor carriers of passengers,except that passenger operations at Mexican border municipalities wouldbe excluded from the expanded zones for the reasons stated in <T3>Petition to Estab._Commercial Zone Certain Counties in TX.</T3>, 133M.C.C. 530, 540 (1986).Finally, we propose to simplify and streamline the commercial zone andterminal area regulations by eliminating surplusage, updating all statutorycitations, eliminating unnecessary sections (<T3>e.g.</T3>, 49 CFR 1048.13), and rearranging and renumbering the sections.Additional information is contained in the Commission's decision.
