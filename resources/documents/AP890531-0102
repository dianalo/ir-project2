(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An official appointed to draft anintegration plan for Louisiana's public colleges recommendedeliminating most open-admissions policies and putting all 17schools under a single governing board.   No universities would be closed or merged under the proposalissued Tuesday by Paul Verkuil.   Verkuil, appointed by a federal panel to come up with adesegregation plan for the 145,000-student system, changed fewdetails from a preliminary proposal issued April 18, said JohnKennedy, legal aide to Gov. Buddy Roemer.   The court will have the final say on the plan.   The 17-member board would be appointed by the governor andapproved by the Senate and would govern all public higher educationin Louisiana, replacing four boards that run the 13 four-yearinstitutions and four two-year schools.   Verkuil said the board would be responsible for ``insuring thatprogress toward eliminating Louisiana's racially dual educationsystem is achieved.''   Verkuil was appointed after the court ruled last year that a1981 desegregation agreement between the state and the U.S. JusticeDepartment had failed. The plan had called for spending millions ofdollars to improve predominantly black Southern and Grambling Stateuniversities.   The dispute began 15 years ago when the Justice Departmentaccused the state of running a dual system of higher education forblacks and whites.   Under the plan recommended by Verkuil, president of William andMary College in Virginia, Louisiana State University would becomethe state's flagship institution with the toughest admissionstandards.   A second and third tier of four-year schools with less stringentstandards would be set up, while two-year community colleges wouldcontinue to offer open admissions and would be responsible for mostremedial courses.   The more stringent admissions policies are part of the plan'slarger goal of improving the quality of higher education inLouisiana.   Currently, all Louisiana colleges admit all graduates ofLouisiana high schools. Fifty-four percent of entering freshmenmust take remedial courses.   Kennedy said he did not know if the judges would hear furthercomment from the parties in the case _ including SouthernUniversity, the U.S. Justice Department and the Grmbling alumni _before deciding whether to approve the plan.   Kennedy said Roemer, who had pushed for a single board, waspleased by Verkuil's recommendation. ``The single board is thelinchpin of this whole thing,'' he said.   State Sen. William Jefferson, an attorney for Southern, said hehad not seen the recommendation and declined to comment.   Other parties were not available for immediate comment. Blackleaders had said a unified board would be insensitive to the needsof Southern University and Grambling.   Some proposals for eliminating racial disparities in the statesystem included closing some predominantly black institutions.</TEXT></DOC>
