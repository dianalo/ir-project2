Alan Griffiths, minister for resources, said Australia'soil self-sufficiency rate is up from 65% in 1983, when theLabor Party government took office. He contended thatgovernment deregulation of crude-oil marketing and strategiesto increase exploration have helped improve self-sufficiency.</LP><TEXT>   Production from Australia's biggest fields in Bass Straitis declining, while output from northern offshore fields isrising. Australia imports some oil, but overall is a netexporter of energy, because it is the world's biggest coalexporter and sells liquefied natural gas, uranium andlight-crude oil.   The price of domestically produced crude is kept close tointernational levels. Mr. Griffiths said Australia can'tartificially restrict prices for crude, because such controlswould cause producers to export more crude, reduceexploration and force up oil imports.   But Canberra has insisted that oil companies slow the risein retail prices of gasoline since the Gulf conflict boostedworld prices. Yet gasoline prices could rise four Australiancents a liter next week, the Service Station Associationsaid. Gasoline already costs more than 80 cents (66 U.S.cents) a liter in some parts of the country. A liter is equalto 0.26 gallon.   Mr. Griffiths said Australia has relatively low taxes ongasoline, and cited data showing Australian gasoline usershave been paying about 74 Australian cents a liter, comparedwith the equivalent of 1.62 Australian dollars (US$1.34) inItaly and A$1.31 in France.</TEXT></DOC>
