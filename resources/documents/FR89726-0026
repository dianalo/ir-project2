Communications should identify the regulatorydocket number and be submitted in duplicate to the address specified above.All communications received on or before the closing date for commentsspecified above will be considered by the Administrator before taking actionon the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this Notice may be changedin light of the comments received.Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic,environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submittedwill be available, both before and after the closing date for comments,in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizingeach FAA/public contact, concerned with the substance of this proposal,will be filed in the Rules Docket.Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submittedin response to this Notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped post cardon which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 89-NM-121-AD.''The post card will be date/time stamped and returned to the commenter.<T4>Discussion </T4>The Direction Generale de L'Aviation Civile (DGAC),which is the airworthiness authority of France, in accordance with existingprovisions of a bilateral airworthiness agreement, has notified the FAAof an unsafe condition which may exist on certain Airbus Industrie ModelA300 series airplanes. Results of full-scale fatigue testing by the manufacturerhas revealed cracks in the emergency exit torsion box beam between Frame57A and Frame 58, and between left-hand and right-hand Stringers 14 and15. This condition, if not corrected, could lead to reduced structuralcapability of the fuselage and subsequent decompression of the airplane.Airbus Industrie has issued Service Bulletin A300-53-254, dated February15, 1989, which describes procedures for repetitive inspections for cracksof the emergency exit torsion box beam between Frame 57A and Frame 58,and between the left-hand and right-hand Stringers 14 and 15, and repair,if necessary. The DGAC has classified this service bulletin as mandatory.This airplane model is manufactured in France and type certificated inthe United States under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the FederalAviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement.Since this condition is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes ofthe same type design registered in the United States, an AD is proposedwhich would require repetitive inspections for cracks in the emergencyexit torsion box beam between Frame 57A and Frame 58, and between the left-handand right-hand Stringers 14 and 15, and repair, if necessary, in accordancewith the service bulletin previously described.It is estimated that 66 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected bythis AD, that it would take approximately 7 manhours per airplane to accomplishthe required actions, and that the average labor cost would be $40 permanhour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S.operators is estimated to be $18,480.The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation(1) is not a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significantrule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economicimpact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entitiesunder the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draftevaluation prepared for this action is contained in the regulatory docket.A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39</ITAG>Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend Part 39 of the FederalAviation Regulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
