Two casualties inour battle could be the freedom to report news from the frontand the public's right to know exactly what is happening inthe Persian Gulf.   The Pentagon has placed restrictions on journalists thatwould make it difficult, if not impossible, to give Americansa precise account of the conflict. One restriction requiresjournalists to work in small groups with military escorts;another demands that we show officials every picture and wordbefore they reach the American home.</LP><TEXT>   During the Vietnam War, reporters could go anywhere --anytime -- often with the military taking us along. Therewere two basic restrictions in Vietnam. First, that no troopmovements be reported prior to engagement. Second, that nofaces of dead or wounded soldiers be shown before theirfamilies had been properly notified. Both restrictions weretotally understandable, and there were virtually noviolations of the guidelines by any American newsorganization.   If all the government wants to do in the Persian Gulf isguarantee that national security and human dignity are notcompromised, we agree with those concerns. But what happensif a middle-level official wants to restrict more than that?What happens if the real story is being censored for otherreasons? What happens if the military wants to promote thegood and extract the bad?   Contrary to the spirit and fact of the Vietnam guidelines,the Pentagon's restrictions go too far.   The new guidelines guarantee pack journalism -- the worstform of reporting -- and allow the military to orchestrateand control the news before it reaches the American people.Without free, open reporting, the country would mostly getits news from the same people from the same locations sayingroughly the same thing. There is little room for originalreporting.   The American public would be ill served by suchrestrictions. While I fully understand the concern thatviolent scenes or disturbing reports could be unsettling, thealternative could be disastrous. I do not think the Americanpublic wants its news sanitized. I believe Americans want thewhole picture. All sides. The good and the bad. In short, thetruth.   Consider what happened when the military kept journalistsaway from combat in Panama and Grenada. More than a yearafter the Panama invasion, we still don't have all the facts.We don't even know how many people were killed there. Even inGrenada, actual accounts are still unclear.   In Vietnam, the military version of events often did notcoincide with the facts. Had media in the U.S. relied solelyon military briefings -- without the option of independentreporting -- Americans would have gotten a false account ofthe war.   As journalists, we need to seek out the story and relay itto the public. If we interview a soldier, we want to obtainfrank, unpackaged responses that give people a better feelfor the story at the front. But if Bob Simon, CBS News'sveteran war correspondent, interviews the soldier with amilitary escort by his side, will the soldier really tell thetruth? Will we really find out what is happening in thedesert? I have to conclude that the answer is no.   Recent history is filled with startling revelationsreported by a free and open press. And they go beyond wars.Would Woodward and Bernstein have uncovered the Watergatescandal with White House aides accompanying them oninterviews and approving their copy? Of course not.   In the days ahead, all news organizations, including CBSNews, will continue to push for the relaxation of governmentrestrictions. The four television networks have urgedSecretary of Defense Richard Cheney to reconsider thegovernment's position. Other media organizations have takenthe issue to the courts.   Unless all journalists have more freedom to report, thereal loser in our battle will be the American people.   ---   Mr. Ober, who was an enlisted man in the Army from 1963 to1965, is president of CBS News in New York.</TEXT></DOC>
