The Kuwaiti agency made the disclosure shortly after Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC announced that the agency had reduced its holding in the Scottish bank to 11.9% from 14.4%. The agency sold the 2.5% holding to Spain's Banco Santander Group for #27 million ($45.7 million), Royal Bank said, as part of a cooperation pact announced by the Spanish and Scottish banks yesterday.    The Kuwaiti agency, which rarely comments on its investments, declined to elaborate on the announcement of its Midland stake. A Midland spokesman said the agency had been a shareholder for several years and the bank wasn't concerned that the stake had risen above the level requiring disclosure.    The agency said it acquired 1.5 million Midland shares, or 0.27% of the bank's stock, last Thursday. That raised its holding to 5.1%, the level at which it must disclose its stake under British regulations. The 5.1% stake is valued at #116 million, based on Midland's share price of 414 pence ($7.01) late yesterday, which was down seven pence from Friday.    Although the Kuwaiti agency long has acquired big stakes in British companies, its tactics have become more aggressive recently. Its 22% stake in British Petroleum Co. has been scrutinized by the British government to determine if the large holding is against the public interest. The government's report is expected soon.    But the agency has been a passive investor in Royal Bank, a Royal Bank spokesman said. And analysts said they expect a similar stance with Midland.    Midland Bank was the subject of intense takeover speculation last year after Saatchi andamp; Saatchi Co. expressed interest in a merger. The overture was rebuffed and, two months later, Midland reached a pact with Hongkong andamp; Shanghai Banking Corp. giving the Hong Kong bank a friendly 14.9% holding in Midland. That stake is seen as an obstacle to a hostile bid.    Meanwhile, in the pact announced yesterday, Banco Santander agreed to take a 5% stake in Royal Bank of Scotland, which in turn will acquire as much as 2.5% of the Spanish group. The pact is designed to bolster the banks' market position before the planned creation of a unified European Community market in 1992.    The banks will maintain their independence but will embark on a number of joint ventures designed to improve services to clients, including product development and the establishment of an offshore banking unit in Gibraltar. They also agreed to study further joint expansion. </TEXT></DOC>
