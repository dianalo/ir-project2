Some of the world's top snow sculpting teams were here for thefestival, which was preceded by rain and mild temperatures. Luckily,Icebreaker fest organizers, thinking ahead, saved huge blocks ofsnow from a late-December storm.   According to the National Weather Service, the averagetemperature in Milwaukee for January was 28.6 degrees throughWednesday, about 10 degrees above normal. The mercury hasn't dippedbelow zero in Milwaukee once this winter, the weather service said.   Snowfall so far this winter was 12.5 inches, only about a quarterof the normal total for the season, and no one expects the shortfallto be made up by the end of winter.   The snow sculpting contest, now in its fourth year, drawsthousands of spectators to gaze at the often highly detailedcreations, most more than 8 feet tall, made from 10-ton blocks ofsnow.   Because of the warm weather, Icebreaker fest organizers arerecommending sculptors work at night when temperatures are lower.They also ordered wood chips to cover the muddied grounds, and movedice-sculpting events to a refrigerated ice house.   The snow-sculpting compeition event has drawn teams from 10countries.   ``Well, I was all psyched up about coming here. Coming fromEngland where it is usually a lot milder, I expected to see lots ofsnow and some cold temperatures. But so far it's just like beingback home,'' said Ron Dutton, of Wolverhampton, England, a member ofthe three-man British team.   Dutton, who worked Thursday on his team's sculpture, said rainWednesday and the weather made sculpting his 10-ton block of snowdifficult. Competitors complain that the month-old blocks of snoware soft on the inside and brittle on the outside.   Karin Bach, of the Canadian women's team, said the rain waschanging sculptors' strategy.   ``A lot of people will hold back on their details until Fridaynight, especially with this weather,'' she said.   ``All the sculptors were inside, you know. Everyone looked reallydejected, really disappointed,'' she said Thursday. ``But we're allback today and we'll still have some excellent works no matter whatthe weather.''   Gene Kempfer, director of the snow sculpting competition, saidthe forecast for spring-like temperatures this weekend forced him tomove up the time of the judging a few hours Saturday so that judgescould see the finished products before the sun began melting them.</TEXT></DOC>
