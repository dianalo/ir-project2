Cook Nuclear Plant, Unit No.2; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is consideringissuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License No. DPR-74 issuedto Indiana Michigan Power Company (the licensee) for operation of the DonaldC. Cook Nuclear Plant, Unit 2, located at the licensee's site in BerrienCounty, Michigan.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Assessment</ITAG>Identification of Proposed ActionThe proposed amendment would revise the provisions in the Technical Specifications(TSs) relating to moderator temperature coefficient, shutdown margin andengineered safeguards actuation requirements to reflect the steamline breakanalysis performed by Advanced Nuclear Fuels Corporation for D.C. CookUnit 2.The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application datedAugust 15, 1988.The Need for the Proposed ActionThe proposed amendment would revise the moderator temperature coefficient,shutdown margin and engineered safeguards actuation requirements to reflectthe steamline break analysis performed by Advance Nuclear Fuels Corporationthe D.C. Cook Unit 2. The analysis was performed for the Cycle 6 reloadand is bounding for the current Cycle 7 reload. The proposed amendmentis needed to change the Technical Specifications to reflect the characteristicsof the new fuel for Cycle 7.Environmental Impacts of the Proposed ActionThe Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed amendment.The safety considerations associated with the steamline break analysisand the proposed amendment have been evaluated by the Commission's staff.The staff has concluded that such changes would not adversely affect plantsafety. The proposed changes have no adverse effect on the probabilityor consequences of any accident. No changes are being made in the typesor amounts of any radiological effluents that may be released offsite.There is no significant increase in the allowable individual or cumulativeoccupational radiation exposure. Accordingly, the Commission concludesthat this proposed action would result in no significant radiological impact.With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed amendmentinvolves systems located within the restricted area, as defined in 10 CFRPart 20. It does not affect nonradiological plant effluents and has noother environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that thereare no significant nonradiological environmental impacts associated withthe proposed amendment.The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity forHearing in connection with this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on November 25, 1988 (53 FR 47782). No requestfor hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following thisnotice.Alternatives to the Proposed ActionSince the Commission has concluded that there are no significant environmentaleffects that would result from the proposed action, any alternative withequal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated.The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendment. Thiswould not reduce environmental impacts of plant operation and would resultin reduced operational flexibility.Alternative Use of ResourcesThis action does not involve the use of any resources not previously consideredin the Final Environmental Statement related to the operation of the DonaldC. Cook Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2, dated August 1973.Agencies and Persons ConsultedThe Commission's staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consultother agencies or persons.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed license amendment.Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that theproposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of thehuman environment.For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment dated August 15, 1988, which is available for public inspectionat the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,DC, and at the Maude Preston Palenske Memorial Library, 500 Market Street,St. Joseph, Michigan 49085.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 10th day of February 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Theodore R.
