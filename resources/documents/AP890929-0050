Today is the deadline by which candidates must register for theFebruary elections. But 24 hours before the cutoff, the NationalOpposition Union was still debating which parliamentary seats eachmember party could run for.   Mauricio Diaz, president of the People's Social Christian Party,said the coalition offered his party an unacceptable twocandidacies, while the Communist and Socialist parties were offeredsix seats each.   Diaz said his party was the fourth largest vote-getter in the1984 elections, while the Communists were fifth and the Socialistssixth.   ``Leftist parties within coalition have too much influence andgreat power,'' Diaz said at the news conference.   But a spokesman for the Opposition Union said Thursday thathigh-ranking members of Diaz's party denied there was a split inranks.   ``The coalition's political council is in session right now ...and the executive commission of the People's Social Christian Partyis in the meeting,'' Union spokesman Luis Sanchez said after Diazannounced his decision.   ``They insist that the party as such will maintain itself withincoalition and that if Diaz is breaking away, he's doing so on hisown,'' Sanchez said.   Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, publisher of the oppositionnewspaper La Prensa, and Virgilio Godoy are the coalition'spresidential and vice presidential candidates for the Feb. 25elections.   Mrs. Chamorro and Godoy are running against President DanielOrtega and Vice President Sergio Ramirez of the Sandinista NationalLiberation Front, which has held power for a decade.   Diaz told reporters his party would support Erick Ramirez, thepresidential candidate of the splinter Social Christian Party.Diaz's party has six deputies in the National Assembly and is thethird-largest opposition party in the country's single-chamberlegislature.   The current National Assembly has 96 deputies.   According to the Nicaraguan Constitution the Assembly has 90seats, but defeated presidential candidates are guaranteed oneplace each and six candidates ran aginst the Sandinistas in 1984elections.   Besides the opposition coalition and the Sandinista Front, atleast six parties are running presidential candidates in nextyear's vote.   The choice of Godoy as the vice presidential candidate fourweeks ago created a crisis in the coalition because some partiesfavored a conservative businessman. Godoy was eventually accepted,but not before some parties had threatened to break away.</TEXT></DOC>
