Vaughan, president and founder ofSmartech Systems, Dallas, Texas.andP;  &quot;By having the machine perform the mundanetasks, operators are free to perform more serious work and enhance theireducation.&quot;andM;FEAR OF THE UNKNOWNandM;Still, even positive change can be difficult and the reality is that certainjobs will be reduced.andM;&quot;Automation is change, and people are inherently afraid of alterations intheir daily routines,&quot; said Jeff Schulman, vice president of softwaremanagement strategies at the Gartner Group, Stamford Conn.andM;&quot;Computer operations staff members have always been survivors,&quot; said RosemaryLaChance, a partner in Farber/LaChance.andP;  &quot;But with A/O [automatedoperations], there exists a number of gray areas and a great deal ofuncertainty.&quot;andM;Uncertainty and misconception are, perhaps, the leading causes for the fearof automation.andP;  The fears surrounding automated operations are the same fearsthat surfaced with the advent of commercially available computers.andP;  At thetime, many felt the computer would eliminate their jobs.andM;In many instances, the introduction of computers into the businessenvironment did eliminate certain jobs--especially jobs that were tedious,paper-burdened, error-prone and labor-intensive.andP;  By computerizing thesetasks, companies realized an almost immediate and significant gain inproductivity.andP;  Although the process is different, the intent of automating adata center is identical.andM;Many data centers, over the last several years, have begun to adoptautomation techniques that have increased efficiency.andP;  One result of thisefficiency has been a personnel reduction.andP;  Since 1985, Nolan, Norton andamp; Co.,andO;an information technology firm of KPMG Peat Marwick, located in Lexington,Mass., has tracked trends in more than 200 &quot;well-run&quot; data centers.andP;  In thedata center baseline model used, the predominant architecture is IBM 3090sand the MVS/XA operating system.andM;Nolan Norton senior manager Michael J. Connolly, in a presentation at therecent Association for Computer Operations Management (AFCOM) conference inWashington, said that on average, these data centers experienced a downwardtrend in personnel of approximately 14% annually; 1988 saw a 27% decrease.andO;(See Figure 1.)andM;However, a recent update of the research has shown that the efficienciesgained by staff reductions have leveled off in the well-run data centers.andO;&quot;These data centers are experiencing diminishing levels of return,&quot; he said.andO;&quot;The key to reaching the next level of efficiency is to integrate the controlsoftware.&quot;andM;Although many of the organizations that have implemented A/O eventuallyreduced head-count either through retraining and reassignment, layoffs orattrition, staff reductions typically are not an immediate occurrence.andM;In a study performed by Suzanne Nicastro, product manager at LegentCorporation, Pittsburgh, Pa., 82% of the companies surveyed decreasedoperations staff after approximately the first 30 months of an A/O project,while the remaining 18% experienced a staff increase.andP;  Yet, more than 75% ofthe decrease has been attributable to either employee movement fromoperations to new or existing nonoperations positions, or through attrition.andM;&quot;It's a double-edged sword,&quot; said Farber of Farber/LaChance.andP;  &quot;But the swordtakes a while to swing back.andP;  Automation will initially display a markedincrease in productivity while staff reductions usually occur much later.&quot;andO;In fact, Farber added, because of operations involvement with the project inaddition to handling the usual daily workload, many organizations tend to beshort-staffed when first implementing A/O.andM;Most notable in Nicastro's study were the reasons why organizations decidedto automate their data centers.andP;  Management's desire to decrease operationalerrors and increase/maintain system availability ranked above the desire toreduce staff costs.andP;  Although some companies may look to automation as ameans to reduce staff, the vast majority cite productivity gains, improvedprocessing and a variety of valid business reasons for their move toautomation.andM;PERFORMANCE PRESSURESandM;Over the past decade, as hardware costs have decreased, staffing costs haveincreased.andP;  Budgets have grown at 6% annually on average, according to NolanNorton's data, while availability and response times have shown littleimprovement.andP;  &quot;Data centers have to run faster to stay in place,&quot; Connollysaid.andP;  &quot;Senior executives who see growing budgets and little progress arequestioning the value of the services.&quot;andM;Organizations were presented a series of paths to follow, which included thedevelopment of remote sites, outsourcing or automation.andP;  Hardware usage wasmaximized, processing platforms were elevated to support business and peoplewere pressed to perform at higher levels.andM;Operators were overwhelmed with redundant, often meaningless console messagetraffic while still performing manual tasks and attempting to maintainefficiency.andP;  Still, many companies grew, adding more to the operations burdenand increasing the chances of error.andM;Automation provided a means to decrease all those messages, improveefficiency, streamline controls and reduce the tedious, labor-intensivetasks.andP;  And because an environment was automated, there was no need toincrease staff as the company expanded.andM;&quot;Our workload has tripled,&quot; said Tony Graziano, data center operationsmanager at Chase Manhattan Bank's Infoserve East data center in Lake Success,N.Y., where automation efforts began over four years ago.andP;  &quot;Yet, becausewe've automated, our staff has remained the same size.&quot;andP;  For consoleautomation, Infoserve East is using AF/Operator from Candle Corp., LosAngeles.andM;INVOLVE OPERATIONS STAFFandM;Automaing a data center takes time, and planning is vital for success.andP;  It isimperative for an organization to identify the key players.andP;  In addition, itis vital that operations personnel be involved in the planning process, andthat management establishes clear goals and policies.andM;Operator involvement can help conquer the fear of automation, and it can bemutually beneficial to employer and employee.andP;  The operator's expertise canenhance the automation effort, and the operator, in turn, learns a newtechnology and skill.andM;What was true a generation ago when computers were first introduced stillholds true today--program code represents only a portion of a system.andP;  For aprogrammer to successfully develop and implement a new application, knowledgeof the old methods and procedures is required.andP;  Without the end user's input,an application plan is incomplete and bound for failure.andM;The same situation is true for today's data center.andP;  An automation project,if addressed as a major task, requires the input of the stall most affectedby the changes.andM;&quot;No A/O project will be successful unless the operations staff is involved,&quot;said Leonard Eckhaus, president, AFCOM, Orange, Calif., in his &quot;State of theProfession Address&quot; at the organization's recent 10th annual conference.andM;&quot;We received operator input on what needed to be automated,&quot; said Graziano.andO;&quot;We couldn't have been successful without them.&quot;andM;Automation, according to Farber is &quot;an operations project.andP;  Systemsprogramming involvement is usually required, but the bulk of theresponsibility should reside within the data center.&quot;andM;An analysis of the data center should be performed to devise what Farbercalls an &quot;evolutionary plan&quot; because many unknown obstacles will bediscovered as the strategy moves forward.andM;And, some obstacles will have already been removed.andP;  Many organizations havetaken initial steps toward automating by employing, for example, ascheduling, tape management or DASD management system.andM;Mark M. Levin, principal, Advanced Technology, KPMG Peat Marwick, agrees withFarber's planned approach.andP;  He feels that while software and hardwarecomponents will assist an organization, the current state of the data centermust be the subject of an in-depth review.andP;  By maximizing the usage ofsoftware and hardware already in place, an organization will learn whichdirection to move when the time comes to automate.andM;&quot;For example,&quot; he asked, &quot;are all those tape datasets necessary?andP;  Manyorganizations can realize immediate productivity gains by placing tapedatasets on disk.&quot;andM;Although, Nolan Norton's data shows that while cartridge tape use is slowlytaking over reel tape use, the number of tape mounts is steadily increasing.andO;Short of expensive &quot;robot&quot; technology, tape mounting is a labor-intensivemanual process.andP;  (See Figure 2.)andM;Still, the entire process requires the commitment of both management and thestaff involved.andP;  The perception of computer operations is subject toalteration.andP;  Operators must begin to recognize the changing role of theirenvironment and their responsibilities.andM;According to Levin, operations typically takes a part-time approach tofull-time projects.andP;  For example, the person responsble for a schedulingsystem also possesses a number of other responsibilities.andP;  Applicationdevelopment standards are not introduced into the operations environment.andM;Said Levin, &quot;Companies have willfully underutilized some of their products&quot;by refusing to implement many of the features designed to make a job lessmanual.andP;  He added, &quot;no company would expect an application programmer to dropa hot project to fill out forms or correct JCL.andP;  Operations projects shouldbe treated the same way.&quot;andM;Communication and coordination are vital for success.andP;  When automation wasfirst addressed by senior management at the Geoserve Processing data centerof Manufacturers Hanover Trust in New York, one of the first items addressedwas internal communications.andP;  By formally announcing the bank's plan toautomate, management was able to prevent the inevitable rumor mill fromgaining control and instilling unnecessary panic.andM;&quot;Information communication proves inadequate and inaccurate,&quot; said Michael F.andO;Pasicki, senior vice president of Geoserve Processing.andP;  Since the beginningof the automation project almost five years ago, processing costs have beenreduced by 20%.andP;  &quot;Rapid, direct communication has proven most beneficial.andO;Because we were open with our employees, we never lost any valuable staffmembers as a result of gossip.&quot;andM;Geoserve Processing uses Automate/MVS from Legent Corp., Vienna, Va.andM;Geoserve operators have been elevated to a more technical position and, whilebusiness has grown, staff increases have not been required.andM;&quot;The worse approach I've seen is the surprise attack,&quot; said Schulman.andO;&quot;That's where management doesn't announce changes until they're about tooccur or have already taken place.&quot;andP;  Rumors, as the only method ofcommunication, often cause employees to feel angry and frustrated.andM;But management is not solely accountable for the future of staff members in adata center.andP;  The staff itself must make its presence known and becomeactively involved in the plan.andP;  &quot;Managers must be interested in managingtheir staff and establishing policy for operators,&quot; said the Gartner Group'sSchulman.andP;  &quot;But the staff must be serious about career path or jobretraining.&quot;andM;&quot;Its the responsibility of management to point the staff in the rightdirection,&quot; said Graziano.andP;  &quot;But the staff must be willing or they'll be leftbehind.andP;  There are people who view their jobs as a career.andP;  Over time, you'llsee who's ready to move.&quot;andM;&quot;The most successful companies are energetic,&quot; said LaChance.andP;  &quot;Managementoffers encouragement and assists staff members who are reluctant to change.&quot;andM;&quot;Communicate with your people,&quot; said Dr. Marvin Cetron, founder and presidentof Forecasting International, Washington, while delivering the keynoteaddress at the recent AFCOM conference.andP;  &quot;Make sure they understand theprocess and what you are trying to do.&quot;andM;Many people who have left an automated operations environment have moved intoareas such as technical support or operations analysis.andM;&quot;Or they've gone in the areas such as security administration or LANmanagement,&quot; said Schulman.andP;  &quot;Regardless, people must be serious about careerpaths and job retraining to more forward.&quot;andM;So, what about the people who get left behind?andP;  &quot;There are people who areunable to move from operations when automation occurs,&quot; said Farber.andO;&quot;Sometimes companies are able to place these people into other departmentswithin their organization.andP;  Still, you have to realize that if the employeeis unwilling to change, then they will be left behind.&quot;andM;&quot;The movement of people depends upon the individual's capability,&quot; said PeatMarwick's Levin.andP;  &quot;But remember, you're not installing a product today andbecoming fully automated tomorrow.andP;  Automation is not an overnight process.&quot;andM;&quot;It's a series of short-term projects, each lasting about 9 to 10 months inlength,&quot; said Schulman.andM;By understanding and becoming involved in an A/O project, the very people whowere once intimidated by the concept have usually become experts in the fieldand vital staff members within their organizations.andM;&quot;Experienced A/O personnel will be in demand for at least the next decade,&quot;said Levin.andP;  &quot;We're going to see a career path develop for the next 10years.&quot;andM;&quot;An entirely new service industry is being introduced,&quot; said Cetron.andP;  &quot;By theyear 2000, 44% of our population will be involved in the information analysisbusiness.&quot;andM;EXAMINE NEEDSandM;To begin the automation process, companies should determine where the needsexist.andM;Just as any other portion of software/hardware is purchased, an automationproduct should only be purchased if a need exists.andP;  Instead of attempting toforce the product into an environment after purchase, a proper data centeranalysis will expose the areas requiring addressing.andM;&quot;Go after your highest threshold of pain,&quot; recommended LaChance.andP;  &quot;Identifyyour problem areas and your areas of greatest exposure.&quot;andM;&quot;If you're looking for immediate dollar savings,&quot; said Levin, &quot;then you canbegin with your tape and print areas.andP;  If you're looking for quickproductivity gains, then you should look at console automation, jobscheduling and so on.&quot;andM;&quot;Many organizations begin with message management to start consoleautomation,&quot; said Schulman.andP;  &quot;But there are a variety of places to begin andthose are the places that have been causing you the most problems.&quot;andM;Conquering fears and increasig understanding of the automation process andgoals are not the only issues to resolve.andP;  Lack of integration betweenproducts is still an obstacle.andP;  Solving the integration problem is along-range goal.andP;  For the short term, most companies evaluation how a productaddresses immediate goals and requirements.andP;  Still, many organizations havetraveled beyond short-term mode and are now beginning to requirecross-product communication.andM;&quot;Without cross-communication between products,&quot; said Eckhaus of AFCOM, &quot;alightsout environment will never occur.&quot;andM;Although this lack of communication has recently begun to be addressed withinsingle-vendor product lines, communication between different vendors'products remains a problem.andM;&quot;Products are now beginning to interface out of necessity,&quot; said LaChance.andO;&quot;Companies no longer purchase an entire product line just because they likethe vendor.andP;  They shop around, searching for the product that best suitstheir needs.&quot;andM;&quot;Integration has improved,&quot; said Schulman.andP;  &quot;Some companies have taken majorsteps in this direction, but they still have a long way to go.&quot;andM;While data centers wait for vendors to improve integration, management cantake steps to move the automation process forward.andP;  Studies have proven andthe experts agree: It is vital that an automation project be driven by theoperations staff, with management providing commitment and guidance.andO;Communication from the project's inception will prevent panic andtrepidation, and establishing goals and policy will aid in progress.andM;Automation offers a step forward for organizations choosing to implement theprocess and for the staff involved.andM;&quot;Companies have decided that their operations staff is intelligent andvital,&quot; said LaChance of Farber/LaChance.andP;  Operators are provided with theopportunity to develop new skills and expand their education.andM;&quot;It's not automation,&quot; said Chase Manhattan's Graziano.andP;  &quot;It's operationsevolution.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
