SRC andits corporate predecessor, Seymour Manufacturing Company, processed,stored, and incinerated chemical wastes at the site from about 1970 toearly 1980. The facility was closed when SRC failed to comply with a1978 agreement with the State of Indiana to cease receiving wastes andto institute better waste-management practices. In 1980, several thousanddrums were removed from the site by two potentially responsible parties(PRPs). In 1981, the U.S. EPA removed chemicals from tanks at the siteand disposed of those wastes offsite. A 1982 Consent Decree with potentialPRPs resulted in the removal, between December 1982 and January 1984,of approximately 50,000 drums, 100 storage tanks and the first foot ofcontaminated soil from about 75 percent of the site's surface. A Recordof Decision, signed in September 1986, evaluated the stabilization ofthe ground water plume emanating from the site and selected the implementationof a plume stabilization system to extract, treat and discharge groundwater to a waste water treatment plant.</TEXT></DOC>
