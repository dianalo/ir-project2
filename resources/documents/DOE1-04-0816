The distortions in thespectrum of the microwave radiation and the intensity of the resultingx rays are determined. Bounds on the energy release produced by the explosionsof such stars are compared with available observations. The possibilityof synthesis of light elements in very massive primordial stars is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
