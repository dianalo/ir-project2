My M-1 tank surged ahead and crashed into the wall of an office building in north Dallas.    Luckily for me and my insurance company the tank was a plastic model about a foot long. And, naturally, I wasn't inside; I controlled it by speaking into a headset microphone attached to a small computer. The computer translated my words (like &quot;stop&quot; or &quot;left&quot;) into electrical signals and sent them through a radio transmitter to the tank about 15 feet away.    The tank is a prototype toy made by Voice Control Systems, a small Dallas-based manufacturer of computers that recognize speech. It's the kind of speech-controlled product that people are likely to see more of as a handful of companies try to push their inventions into everyday use.    On the horizon are cellular telephones that can be dialed by speaking a phone number. There are also home-security systems that respond to cries for help, cars with voice-controlled windshield wipers, lights and radios, as well as aids for the handicapped. The possibilities seem endless for toys that respond to children's spoken words.    The devices are rather primitive by human standards; they will understand only about 100 to 200 words, and nearly all need to be trained to recognize the voice of the primary user. &quot;We've still got a few technology hoops to jump through,&quot; says Lynn Taylor, president of Microphonics Technology Corp. in Auburn, Wash.    Most researchers now believe they have largely conquered the two biggest problems that turned buyers away: abysmal accuracy and difficulty distinguishing speech from background noise. But manufacturers must still convince consumers that they need such products. After all, cars that talked to people -- reminding drivers that lights were on or that doors were open -- proved to be mostly an annoyance. Do people want to talk back?    &quot;Marketing voice recognition has turned out to be very difficult,&quot; says William Spain, who follows the voice-technology industry for Probe Research Inc., a research company in Morristown, N.J. &quot;Talking to appliances seems like a fun idea, but so far no one's been able to make it work.&quot;    One breakthrough has come in car or cellular telephones that can be dialed by speaking. Because of the possible dangers of dialing while trying to steer a car, many industry executives see this as one of the most obvious applications for voice recognition.    Here's how they work: A typical system might have 20 to 40 names that the owner stores beforehand in the computer's memory by speaking the name and then dialing in the corresponding number. When the user picks up the car phone, a spoken code word like &quot;dial&quot; tells the computer it should start listening. Then the user says &quot;husband&quot; or &quot;work&quot; or the name of a friend -- whatever is stored in the memory. The computer then dials the number.    With some systems, users can also dial numbers that aren't already in the computer's memory by speaking the names of the digits in a normal phone number. Before dialing, the computer's recorded voice speaks the numbers back through the phone receiver, to make sure it understood correctly.    Most systems will understand only one person's voice, though companies are trying to get around this hurdle. Voice Control Systems is working on a product that will respond to anyone's voice. Using an unusual approach -- breaking down spoken words into parts, rather than the usual method of matching electronic pictures of complete words against a catalog of such pictures -- Voice Control says its system will understand any accent, from Maine to Texas.    As companies master such so-called speaker independence, individuals may find themselves having more telephone conversations with computers. This is already beginning to happen overseas, partially because of the scarcity of touch-tone phones. Computers can pick up the tones as numbers, but can't do the same for the clicks of the rotary dial phones more prevalent outside the U.S.    In Buenos Aires, Argentina, for instance, tremendous inflation brought Banco del Buen Ayre a deluge of calls from customers checking on interest and exchange rates. Votan, a voice-recognition company in Fremont, Calif., designed a sound-recognition computer system for the bank that handles as many as 20,000 calls a day and allows customers to tranfer funds and get balance information as well as learn interest and exchange rates.    &quot;It helps that the words for numbers in Spanish are longer than in English,&quot; says Bruce Ryon, Votan's director of marketing communications. (The longer the word, the more clues the computer has to recognize it.)    Many companies are looking into aids for the handicapped. The Voice Connection in Irvine, Calif., makes a wheelchair controlled by voice commands. Because the commands must be sent by radio signals through a nearby personal computer, however, the set-up isn't practical outside a house or office.    Other products will include fancier versions of the computer-software &quot;controllers&quot; made by many companies. These allow people to operate some functions of word-processing or spreadsheet programs, for instance, with voice commands. Microphonics Technology says it is developing a combination voice-recognizer, voice-synthesizer that would allow a person to call a personal computer over phone lines and have it read back text in a computer file. The device will cost about $600 and should be out this spring.    Another likely application is cars. For Renault, the French car maker, Votan put together a system that allows voice control of the windshield wipers, radio, heater, air conditioner and windows. It operated in a prototype car shown at a Paris auto show in October.    Not everyone sees the charm in such gadgets. &quot;It has snob appeal, but I don't see any great practical advantages,&quot; says Bob Bargert, publisher of Alarm Installer and Dealer, a magazine that also sponsors home-security trade shows. But others say the masses are ready for voice recognition -- after a bit of fine tuning.    Intellisys Corp., for example, a Dallas research company, built a super-automated house incorporating a Votan system that controlled lights and appliances. &quot;At first we put microphone units in the walls, but people hated it,&quot; says Don Bynum, the company's president. &quot;They felt silly talking to the wall. Once we set it up through the phone they loved it.&quot;    Most people in the industry agree that toys that recognize speech will likely be a hit. A doll named Julie, made by Worlds of Wonder Inc. in Fremont, Calif., made a stir at the New York Toy Fair last month. It recognizes about 25 words and responds with about 100 phrases. It is expected to be priced at about $100 and be available in late summer, the company says.    &quot;Toys, oh boy, are we going to make toys,&quot; says Peter Foster, president of Voice Control Systems. &quot;At the moment we've got to get some serious products out, but&quot; -- he points to skid marks on the office carpet left by researchers testing a voice-steered wheelchair a bit over-zealously -- &quot;you can see these guys really want to have fun.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
