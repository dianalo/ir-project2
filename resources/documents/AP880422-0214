The president has promised to veto the bill because of aprovision requiring all but the smallest employers to give 60 daysnotice of plant closings and large-scale layoffs.   As the Senate began debate on the sweeping trade measure Friday,Reagan told a group of conservative state legislators that theplant-closings provision ``would make American industry lesscompetitive.''   ``Put simply, on key provisions in the trade bill, theDemocratic leadership in Congress has caved in to pressure fromorganized labor,'' Reagan said. ``If this bill is unloaded on mydesk, I'll stamp it reject and ship it back to where it was made.''   The House on Thursday passed the bill, with Democrats achievingmore than the two-thirds vote needed to override a Reagan veto.   The White House continued lobbying senators on Friday to votewith the president, arguing it would force Congress to send him abill without the plant-closing provision.   ``That's wishful thinking,'' Senate Majority Leader Robert C.Byrd, D-W.Va., said as Senate debate began Friday. If enoughsenators voted to sustain the veto, ``we would be taking a severechance in not having this legislation become law,'' he said, ``AndI would argue that we not gamble.''   Byrd said a Senate vote on the 1,000-page bill was expected onTuesday, and although confident it would pass he was not sure hecould muster the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto. TheHouse vote on the legislation was 312-107.   If the president's veto were sustained, Byrd said the trade bill_ a product of years of work and a House-Senate compromise oncompeting bills that passed last year _ would have to start fromscratch in the process.   ``This matter is not going to be turned around that easily andthat quickly,'' Byrd said, noting there were 170 amendments thelast time it was before the Senate.   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas,emphasized the broad scope of the measure, which was being obscuredby the very specific veto fight.   Among its hundreds of provisions, the bill gives new powers tothe U.S. trade representative, repeals the windfall profits tax onoil and relaxes controls on U.S. exports of high technologyequipment.   ``We haven't had a trade policy ... since World War II,''Bentsen said. Although the nation did well without one when it wasthe dominant world economic power, ``that time has since changedand now we're in tough competition,'' he said.   Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., said he, like many Republicans,wanted to support their president but he would vote to override.   ``I hope that when senators vote on this bill they have theireyes open to the consequences,'' he said of the hot election-yearissue. ``It is by no means certain that this bill can be saved insome other form.''   The leaders of Japan, at which much of the trade bill was aimed,made clear Friday they would welcome its demise.   Chief Cabinet Secretary Keizo Obuchi, in a nationally televisednews conference, said relations with the United States would sufferbut said he had ``strong expectations'' the legislation would die.   Hajime Tamura, minister for international trade and industry,said he ``deeply regretted'' House passage of the bill.   ``While I do not think it will be passed in the Senate in theend, I will urge the U.S. administration (to block the bill) andawait the common sense of the American people,'' Tamura said.   The bill includes two provisions regarded as threatening toJapanese business.   One is the provision giving the trade representative power todecide what constitutes unfair trade practices by another country,and what to do about it. Another imposes sanctions against ToshibaCorp. and its subsidiary, Toshiba Machine Co., which soldsubmarine-silencing equipment to the Soviet Union in violation of aWestern trade agreement on sensitive technology exports.</TEXT></DOC>
