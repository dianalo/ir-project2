WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Pressured by a steady drain of disillusionedworkers and increasing calls for reunification, East Germany'sCommunist Party conceded Tuesday that a flawed brand of socialismhad hurt living standards.   In the past month, the Communists have given up their legalmonopoly on power and that has raised questions about their mandateto govern until national parliamentary elections are held May 6.   Secretary of State James A. Baker met in Potsdam with CommunistPremier Hans Modrow in a show of support for the nation's reforms.   One pro-reform group, Demokratischer Aufbruch, said Modrow andhis Cabinet should step down. It does not appear that positionenjoys broad support, however, since Modrow retains a fairly highstanding among East Germans.   Communist Party leader Gregor Gysi said his party would notallow a ``foreign policy vacuum'' to develop despite the upheavalsof the past two months.   ``What we need in this country through May 6 is stability,''Gysi said when informed of the reform group's demand.   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher traveled toEast Berlin to meet with the group's leader Rainer Eppelmann. Nodetails of the talks were disclosed.   The party's official daily, Neues Deutschland, blamed socialismfor poor living conditions in the most blunt admission yet of theparty's culpability in the nation's political and economic crisis.   ``The governmental and administrative socialism has definitelyfailed as a social system in our country,'' the newspaper said.   But, it added, a new ``democratic socialism'' was in the making.   The party appeared torn over the question of closer ties withWest Germany, and the newspaper called for ``a qualifiedpartnership'' acceptable to European neighbors.   Allies of East Germany and West Germany have expressedreservations about a confederation between the nations or eventualreunification, as proposed by West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.   But the economic crisis that has burdened East Germany's morethan 16 million citizens with problems from pollution to scarceconsumer goods continues to drive away the nation's best hope foran improved future _ its young workers.   A prominent social scientist told the official ADN news agencythat 317,500 East Germans have fled to the West so far this year,and that more than 75 percent of them were under age 40.   Wulfram Speigner of the Institute for Sociology and SocialPolicy said the exodus has caused severe labor shortages inDresden, Karl-Marx-Stadt and Leipzig.   The exodus peaked this fall and led in part to the ouster oflongtime party leader Erich Honecker on Oct. 18. Massdemonstrations for reformed continued, however, and the leadershipon Nov. 9 opened its borders, including the Berlin Wall, to allowcitizens to travel freely.   Baker visited the wall Tuesday and then traveled from WestBerlin to Potsdam to meet with Modrow. It was the first time a U.S.secretary of state visited East Germany since diplomatic relationswere established in 1974.   ``I felt that it was important that we have an opportunity tolet the premier and the people of East Germany know of our supportfor the reforms which are taking place in this country,'' Bakersaid later.   Modrow said the visit was seen as an endorsement of reform. ``Westarted a dialogue with each other today,'' he said.   Also Tuesday, the two German states agreed to a joint project toinstall 188 new international telephone lines in East Germanywithin a week.   Communications ministers Klaus Wolf of East Germany andChristian Schwarz-Schilling of West Germany did not say how muchthe project will cost.   Wolf said that 98 percent of the existing telephones in EastGermany are worn out, and that his ministry has applications for1.2 million new installations in private homes.   Schwarz-Schilling said the new lines will allow 30,000 morecalls a day, but were only a ``drop on a hot stone.''   Officials said it would cost about $6.7 billion to bring EastGermany's phone network up to Western standards.   Despite disagreements over the desired level of cooperationbetween the countries, other projects are under negotiation.   West German officials have offered wide-ranging aid to help EastGermany deal with its economic troubles in return for democraticreforms, including free elections.   East German officials have characterized those terms as asellout and have tried to work toward reform within a socialiststructure.   But weekly demonstrations in the city of Leipzig haveillustrated growing support for a confederation or reunificationwith capitalist West Germany.</TEXT></DOC>
