A statement from the environmental group, issued in New York,said its members were knocked down and dragged through mud and rocksby workers at an airstrip at France's Dumont d'Urville station,located on one of five small Antarctic islands claimed by France.   It was Greenpeace's fourth expedition to Antarctica, where theorganization established the only non-government run environmentalbase in 1987.   The expedition was to spend seven weeks visiting U.S., WestGerman, Soviet, Italian and New Zealand bases in Antarctica todocument waste disposal and pollution.   The group went to the French base to protest the construction ofa runway which they say will cut through a natural breeding groundand migration area for penguins.   The clash occurred after protesters erected a portable hut in thepath of French bulldozers and held a banner reading ``Halt theAirstrip _ Greenpeace.''   The Greenpeace communique said the station's officer-in-chargesaw a video of the brawl and ``admitted the construction workerswere out of control,'' Greenpeace expedition coordinator PeterWilkinson said in the statement.   A spokesman for Louis Le Pensec, France's minister for overseasterritories, denied a conflict occurred and said the group receivedauthorization from the government to visit the French station.   The group had been welcomed on arrival Thursday by 30 Frenchscientists, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity in keepingwith ministry rules. He said the ministry had spoken withauthorities at the base who confirmed the Greenpeace members erecteda hut on the airstrip.   Greenpeace has clashed with Frane several times. In 1985 theGreepeace vessel Rainbow Warrior was bombed in Auckland harbor bypeople who were later identified as working for the Frenchintelligence service.</TEXT></DOC>
