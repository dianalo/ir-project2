<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-83-0272 </DOCNO><TEXT>A unified theory of photopion reactions in two-nucleon systems ({gamma}d{yields}pn,{pi}{sup 0}d, and {pi}NN) and NN bremsstrahlung (NN{yields}NN{gamma})is presented. By exposing the two-body [BB, where B = N or {Delta}(1232)]and three-body ({pi}BB and {gamma}BB) unitarity, we derive a set of coupledintegral equations to determine the amplitudes for these reactions. Theseequations have the same kernel as the equations one gets for the BB-{pi}BBsystem. The two-body input amplitudes are the result of a coupled channelunitary theory for {pi}N{yields}{pi}N and pion photoproduction on a singlebaryon, within the framework of a gauge and chirally invariant Lagrangian,which is obtained from the chiral bag model Lagrangian. The renormalizationdue to the {pi}B interaction is incorporated in a consistent manner.</TEXT></DOC>
