Authorities feared a new round of violence between members ofthe Pakistan People's Party of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto andthe Mohajir Qami Movement, which claims discrimination against theIndian immigrants it represents.   Hospital sources said Najeeb Ahmad, 22, a student leader of Ms.Bhutto's party, remained in a coma after a weekend shooting spreethat left 17 people dead and 55 wounded. His chances of survivingwere considered low, said physicians, who refused to be identified.   Thousands of supporters keeping a 24-hour vigil outside thehospital blame Ahmad's injuries on the Mohajir Qami Movement.   The movement's militant leader, Altaf Hussein has vowed tostarve himself to death unless police release 21 of his supporters,arrested in connection with the weekend shooting spree.   About 5,000 soldiers have been patrolling Hussein's neighborhoodin Karachi's congested central district, since he began his hungerstrike.   Thousands of supporters have camped out in front of his home,many of them wailing and chanting slogans against Ms. Bhutto'sparty.   Arif Ahmed, 28, swooned and cried.   ``I am prepared to die with my leader,'' he said joining Husseinin his hunger strike.   Selma Khatoon, a Pakistani woman, hidden behind a flowing shawl,said ``I am praying around the clock for the life and health ofAltaf Hussein.   ``I am helpful he will be alive to protect the Mohajirsinterest,'' she said.   In a prepared release, the southern Sindh provincial government,dominated by Ms. Bhutto's party, said ``some people who want toblackmail and believe in terrorism are trying to create a law andorder situation.''   ``The demands of the MQM are that there should not be any legalaction against the terrorists and against all those involved invarious crimes,'' the prepared release said in reference to theMohajir Qami Movement.   The two parties regularly exchange charges of terrorism,kidnapping and torture.   In the past several years about 1,000 people have been killed inethnic-related violence. The main opponents are Sindh nationalists,who want greater autonomy for their southern province, andHussein's MQM, who want to be recognized as a fifth nationality.   Hussein claims that Indian immigrants, who dominate Sindh'scities of Karachi and Hyderabad, 100 miles to the north, have beendenied jobs and promotions because of their origins.   Pakistan became independent of British colonial rule in 1947.</TEXT></DOC>
