The states asked EPA to publish for public comment twoprocedural findings made by the agency under President Carter justbefore he left office: That acid rain originating in U.S. pollutionendangers the environment in Canada; and that Canada grants theUnited States the same rights to protest air pollution there thatCanada has to protest air pollution here.   The Canadian province of Ontario filed a similar petition of itsown, said Jim Hecker, a Washington lawyer representing the province.   Those findings must be made before EPA could order the states torequire reductions in the precursors of acid rain. Then-EPAAdministrator Douglas Costle announced those decisions in early1981.   In a case brought by eight of the states and Ontario, a federalappeals court said the findings, to be valid as a starting pointfor further action, had to be published as draft agency regulationsto give the public a chance to comment on them. The Supreme Courtdeclined to intervene.   In asking for quick action _ within 60 days _ on the groundsthat the substance of the question had been decided for years, andindeed affirmed in statements by various officials includingPresident Reagan, the states said, ``These elementary decisions donot involve identification of sources or responsible states, or theprescription of emission reductions or other remedial actions.''   In the Reagan administration, EPA has resisted doing anythingabout Costle's letter on the grounds that not enough was knownabout acid rain to tell the states what to do, or even specifywhich states should be targeted. The administration has agreed withCanada to spend $2.5 billion, matched by industry, to speed thecommercialization of cleaner methods of burning coal.   In earlier proceedings, the plaintiffs said EPA should orderemission reductions in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky,Tennessee, West Virginia and Illinois.   Acid rain results from the conversion of oxides of sulfur andnitrogen emitted by the combustion of fossil fuels into sulfuricand nitric acids in the atmosphere. Though there are manycontributors, sulfur dioxide emitted by coal-burning power plantsand factories is major source of the acid precursors.   Many environmentalists blame acid rain for acidifying lakes andstreams in the Northeast and in eastern Canada to the point thatfish cannot live.   In a parallel case, many of the same states are trying to forceEPA to order other states upwind of them to require emissionsreductions from sources within their borders to enable the downwindstates to fulfill their own air pollution control plans. That casewill be argued for the second time later this month before the U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.   Thursday's petitioners were Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire,Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey,Minnesota, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club,the Izaak Walton League and the National Audubon Society.</TEXT></DOC>
