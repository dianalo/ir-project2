This would seem to repel foreign investors with increased currency risk and shrinking yields on debt securities. Why on earth, many on Wall Street wonder, is new Fed boss Alan Greenspan acquiescing when foreign capital would seem so welcome in U.S. markets in these troubled days?    Well, for openers, Mr. Greenspan and the Fed seem to have little choice but to pour on the liquidity to stave off a further stock market collapse and the recession that almost certainly would ensue.    And the timing seems right. With flight capital surging from the stock market into the bond market (where foreigners invest most), it's presumably less troublesome now if foreigners bail out than at any other time in recent memory.    Moreover, Mr. Greenspan may be able to pour on the liquidity without driving away foreign investors. Presuming the money spigot stays on a while longer, foreign sellers of U.S. bonds would leave behind yields that might not be duplicated anytime soon. Currency risk also might not justify a retreat. After all, the difference between a 120-yen dollar and a 140-yen dollar is 14.3% and the difference between a 9.5% bond yield and a 7.5% yield is 21%.    Encore!   As every student of the Ivan Boesky insider-trading scandal knows, Martin A. Siegel, the brilliant young Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. investment banker whose mergers-and-acquisitions advisory exploits made him Kidder's &quot;Man of the Year&quot; in 1985, has since come a cropper. In February he pleaded guilty to selling inside information to Mr. Boesky.    In June, Kidder settled charges that the firm's own merger arbitrager used inside information from Mr. Siegel to trade for Kidder's own account. The General Electric Co. unit both agreed to get out of the merger arbitrage business and pay a $25.3-million fine.    These days, as they look around at the other big Wall Street firms that have lost twice that much on their merger arbitrage business during the past two weeks, Kidder insiders have to wonder if Mr. Siegel ought to be Man of the Year again in 1987.    &quot;Some people around here don't think that's so funny,&quot; says a Kidder spokesman, &quot;but it's a whole lot easier to take when you're making a profit, and we are profitable this month.&quot;    Outpourings   The typical financial reporter reads a whole lot of things you'd rather not know about, but in the past couple of weeks there've been some delicious exceptions.    Some examples:   --Oct. 23, four days after Bloody Monday, when program trading and portfolio insurance strategies blended explosively to spur the record 508-point market meltdown, comes a re-aimed missive from a seer scorned. He is Gerald Celente, director of the Socio-Economic Research Institute of America. And his message is an apparently widely ignored Jan. 20, 1987, news release.    The release contends that, among other things, &quot;1987 will be the year (that a festering international crisis) hits the fan;&quot; that its symptoms will include &quot;an international, monetary crisis fueled by trade wars and debt&quot; and &quot;stock market volatility -- market swings of up to 25%.&quot;    All that is highlighted with a chartreuse felt marker so that even financial journalists can't fail to spot Mr. Celente's prescient musings. But not all his predictions or advice in the release are so highlighted.    A prediction that isn't: Precious metals prices will &quot;more than double in 1987.&quot; (Gold ended 1986 at $404.90 an ounce and yesterday at $468.70).    And some unhighlighted advice: &quot;It would be prudent for both small and major investors to consider new strategies for the future. To protect themselves financially, we recommend portfolio insurance.&quot;    --Market-letter publisher Charles M. LaLoggia's Special Situations Report, Oct. 9 issue, was headlined: &quot;No Major Correction -- No Bear Market -- New Highs Ahead.&quot; Then, in a black-bordered &quot;interim update,&quot; dated Oct. 23: &quot;I am truly disappointed that I did not foresee what transpired.&quot;    --Time magazine's Nov. 2 issue, in a blow-by-blow account of the Oct. 19 market collapse, describes the frantic trading day at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp., including the presence of armed guards on the firm's trading floor. Trouble is, both the armed guards and Time's reporter didn't show up until the next day, Oct. 20. Says a Donaldson Lufkin official: &quot;If we'd known enough to have the guards that Monday, we'd have known enough to do some other things, too.&quot;    --From Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., in a statement issued just after the market closed on Bloody Monday: &quot;As Franklin Delano Roosevelt once said, 'We have nothing to fear but fear itself.'&quot; Questions of hyperbole aside, FDR actually said, on March 4, 1933, &quot;The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
