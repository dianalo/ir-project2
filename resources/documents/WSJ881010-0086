Assets of international stock funds, which invest almost exclusively outside the U.S., recently retreated to about $6.5 billion after being at $7 billion or more for more than two years, according to the Investment Company Institute. In 1984, assets of such funds totaled just $1.2 billion, the Washington-based trade group said.    Growth in global stock and bond funds, which mix U.S. and foreign holdings, also has slowed drastically, according to the institute.    Take the case of Michael Tinkler, a Wayne, Pa., real estate executive. As foreign funds surged during the dollar's 1985-87 decline, Mr. Tinkler played them heavily. Now, with the dollar showing renewed vigor or at least stability for much of this year, he has eased up on the foreign funds.    &quot;I'm trying to wait until I feel strongly that the dollar has topped out,&quot; Mr. Tinkler says. &quot;Until then, I'm not going to make any long-term investments.&quot;    For much of last year, international and global stock funds were the darlings of the mutual fund business, with performance gains of nearly 46% and 38%, respectively, through September 1987. Since then, they have trailed most equity fund categories tracked by Lipper Analytical Services Inc.    World income funds, which invest in overseas bonds, have taken the steepest fall. After leading all other Lipper categories in 1987's fourth quarter with a rise of more than 10%, world income funds haven't even broken even this year. Through September, they lost 0.84%, the second worst performance among groups that Lipper tracks.    Many of those have been doubly battered -- by slumping prices of the bonds in the portfolio as well as by losses on currency translations. But the prime cause for the slump of all foreign funds is the foreign-exchange losses caused by the firming dollar. Although it's been flat lately, through September the dollar had risen 10% this year against the Japanese yen and more than 16% against major European currencies. This means that an international fund would have lost 10% or more of its value for purely currency reasons.    &quot;If a fund invested in local currencies had gains of 10% to 16%, it would show up here looking like a lousy fund, when it's performed admirably,&quot; says John Woronoff, publisher of the International Fund Monitor, a Washington-based newsletter.    Still, some fund specialists say investors who have stood by their foreign funds should continue to do so. Despite the dollar's rebound, many of them expect it to resume its fall before too long.    &quot;The short term is difficult to call for political reasons,&quot; says Rein van der Does, portfolio strategy director for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. &quot;But over the longer term, the dollar should decline,&quot; he says, partly because of the need to finance the U.S.'s huge current-account deficit.    Some foreign markets have been hurt more than others in the dollar translation. The Dutch and French markets rose 32% and 35% in terms of their local currencies this year through September, but they appeared far less impressive in the U.S. because of an approximately 16% loss against the dollar. At the same time, the Hong Kong market rose only 6%. But with its currency linked to the U.S. dollar, it held its ground when it came to exchange-rate translations.    But not all foreign funds have been hit hard. The four open-end Templeton global funds, for instance, have surged from 18% to 27% so far this year. John Templeton, fund manager, says he has found many bargains in, among other places, Hong Kong and Thailand. &quot;We search for shares selling at the lowest possible price,&quot; Mr. Templeton says. &quot;And you don't find those in nations that are popular.&quot;    Besides Hong Kong, Mr. Templeton says, good buys now are in Canada, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Britain -- and in the U.S. In fact, two-thirds of Mr. Templeton's bets this year have been in the U.S., the largest weighting in one nation he's ever had.    Japan is conspicuously absent from Mr. Templeton's holdings. But investors who have stuck it out in the ever-rising Tokyo market have prospered. Drexel, for one, recently scaled down its suggested Japanese weighting among international funds to about 30% from 45% earlier in the year and now regrets it. &quot;We've been pretty wrong with underweighting Japan,&quot; says Drexel's Mr. van der Does.    Japanese issues currently have about a 63% weighting in Morgan Stanley Capital International's Europe, Australia and Far East Index. The index, a benchmark for managers of overseas portfolios, is a market-capitalization-weighted measure of 16 markets. It rose 9.8% through September.    As for the best-performing international funds this year, the names tell it all. Some leaders: GAM Pacific Basin Fund, G.T. Pacific Growth Fund, G.T. Japan Growth Fund, Financial Portfolio-Pacific Fund, D.F.A. Japan Small Company Fund. The laggards have tended to invest in Europe, particularly West Germany, Italy and France.    But some specialists urge investors to lower their expectations across the board. With short-term rates rising around the world, there are signs the current economic cycle may finally be nearing an end, says Mr. van der Does, meaning that investors may have to make do with slimmer profits than they have been used to.    &quot;We've been very spoiled over the past five years,&quot; he says. &quot;Sometimes you have to be satisfied if you can make real {inflation-adjusted} returns of 4% to 4.5%. That may be a nice return for the next 12 to 18 months.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
