The 326-2 vote sent the measure to President Reagan, who has threatened to veto it. Administration officials said the bill presumes, without scientific proof, a connection between cancer and the service-related exposure to radiation from nuclear weapons.    Under the bill, which the Senate passed 48-30 last week, the conditions of veterans who developed any of 12 types of cancer within 40 years of their exposure or developed leukemia within 30 years, would be presumed to have resulted from military service.    About 250,000 members of the U.S. military were exposed to radiation in Hiroshima and Nagasaki -- where the U.S. dropped nuclear bombs -- during the occupation of Japan, or during tests of nuclear weapons in the South Pacific and western U.S. in the years after World War II.    Currently, any of those veterans with cancer may receive disability benefits if they can prove their conditions resulted from service-related exposure. Of about 6,000 such claims filed, 44 have been approved, according to Rep. J. Roy Rowland (D., Ga.), a member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee.    If enacted into law, the benefits would cost $36 million for the year beginning Oct. 1, according to the Congressional Budget Office. </TEXT></DOC>
