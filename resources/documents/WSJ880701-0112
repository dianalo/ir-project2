The pleas by John R. Lytle, former Continental vice president, and by William Patterson, former executive vice president of the defunct Penn Square Bank of Oklahoma City, could send each man to jail for as long as five years for their part in Continental's disastrous purchase of more than $1 billion in oil and gas loans from Penn Square. Those loans led to losses of more than $800 million and were the single biggest factor in Continental's 1984 collapse and $4.5 billion federal bailout.    Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, Orange County real estate developer James D. Stout was indicted by a federal grand jury on fraud charges growing out of the collapse of Beverly Hills Savings andamp; Loan Assocation, which is expected to cost about $1 billion. Mr. Stout was accused of taking a $1.5 million kickback as part of an apartment-complex transaction that is believed to have led to $50 million in losses.    Both cases rank among the biggest and most complex in what has become a huge backlog of costly bank fraud cases facing federal prosecutors. Congress has pressured the Justice Department to act more swiftly on the cases.    Messrs. Lytle and Patterson were first indicted in September 1984, the day after Continental's bailout became final, but the government's case encountered a number of procedural setbacks, and didn't come to trial until last March. &quot;This case has substantial age on it,&quot; U.S. District Court Judge Milton I. Shadur said yesterday. The seven-week trial ended in a jury deadlocked 11-1 for conviction of the two bankers. A third defendant, oil man Jere A. Sturgis, was aquitted of all charges.    Nevertheless, U.S. Attorney Anton R. Valukas said, &quot;We were going to retry the case. This case was not going to go away.&quot; He wouldn't comment on how plea-bargaining talks began.    Mr. Lytle, once a fast rising loan-department star at Continental, which itself was booming, looked straight ahead as Judge Shadur reviewed the pleas. &quot;We've come to an agreement that's fair to all parties,&quot; Mr. Lytle said after the hearing, declining to elaborate.    Mr. Patterson, famous for his antics during the Oklahoma oil boom and known in college as &quot;monkey brains,&quot; was subdued. Both men face sentencing Aug. 30, and the government will seek prison terms, while the bankers' lawyers said they would ask for parole.    As part of the plea bargain, the government will move to dismiss all except the single count. In it, Mr. Patterson admitted to procuring a loan of about $2.3 million from Continental, saying it was for one Penn Square customer when, in fact, it was for another, who was in deep financial trouble. He filled out a Continental loan document himself, and put a loan officer's name on it, misspelling the name.    Mr. Lytle admitted to making the loan without investigating the borrower's ability or willingness to repay. Months earlier, another Continental loan officer had expressed doubts about lending the customer money.    The government had also alleged that Mr. Lytle received a $565,000 kickback from Penn Square, in the form of personal loans, in exchange for making the more than $1 billion in loans. Both men previously denied all the charges against them.    The Beverly Hills collapse wasn't as spectacular as Continental's, but still ranks as one of the costliest ever by a financial institution.    According to the 11-count indictment of Mr. Stout, he arranged the purchase of nine apartment complexes by a partnership he controlled, and the Sandamp;L invested $155 million. The indictment alleges that Mr. Stout received the $1.5 million kickback between 1982 and 1984, from a real estate broker that found the apartment complexes and received $3.8 million in fees. Beverly Hills was defrauded, the indictment charges, because it was ignorant of the kickback scheme. The real estate broker wasn't charged in the indictment.    Mr. Stout couldn't be reached for comment. His lawyer, Randall J. Turk, said, &quot;The payments at issue in the indictment were perfectly lawful under the contract entered into between the parties.&quot; He declined further comment.    The three-year-old Beverly Hills investigation is one of several under way by federal prosecutors in Southern California, where a series of big and costly savings and loan failures has occured. In 1985, Beverly Hills Savings was taken over by federal thrift regulators and was the subject of congressional hearings looking into its collapse. </TEXT></DOC>
