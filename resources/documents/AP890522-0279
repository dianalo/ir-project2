MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   It seems only logical, just plain commonsense: when diplomats strike a deal to eliminate some weapons, thesoldiers who have been manning them won't have to do so any more.   So, with the United States scrapping intermediate-range nuclearmissiles in western Europe under an arms control treaty with theSoviet Union, the American troops assigned to the missile unitsought to be coming home.   Right, said Rep. Andy Ireland of Florida.   Wrong, said the Pentagon.   When Ireland advanced his proposition the other day, he said hewas left feeling like the skunk at the garden party.   It turned out the Defense Department wasn't planning on pullingany U.S. forces out of Europe just because of the missile treaty.The missile personnel would just stay put and get new assignments.   Ireland, a Republican who prides himself on a hawkish record ondefense legislation, said the military is playing ``kind of a shellgame.''   When he first raised the manpower question, he was told about25,000 U.S. personnel are on assignments that will be eliminated bythe INF treaty. This meant the assignments would go, not themanpower. After the congressman said he had in mind recalling themfrom Europe, there was some delay followed by a new, reducedPentagon estimate of the number involved _ more like 5,000.   Ireland said the real count probably is about 16,000 U.S.personnel on European assignments that will be obsolete under theINF treaty.   In any event, he was told, most of them were supposed to bedoing something else anyhow. They had been diverted from otherassignments to missile duty, all because Congress was so stingywith manpower. Now they can get back to whatever it was theservices wanted them doing in the first place.   Congress may decide otherwise.   Ireland and Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., are sponsoring alegislation to have U.S. personnel assigned to theintermediate-range missile units pulled returned to the UnitedStates when the weapons are eliminated.   That wouldn't make a big dent in the 325,000 U.S. troops stillstationed in Europe. But Ireland said it would at least send amessage to U.S. allies in Europe that they have to pay a biggershare of defense costs. ``We've got to leave the check on the tableone time and let the Europeans pick it up,'' he said.   But the armed services don't want cuts. A defense official tolda House hearing last Thursday that the military is at work on ``avariety of proposed missions'' for the missile bases the treatyrenders obsolete.   ``We have made significant progress in the identification of newmissions,'' said John A. Woodworth, deputy assistant secretary ofdefense for international security policy.   No specifics, he said. That's classified.   Those overseas bases have remarkable staying power, since theyare mission-shopping while Congress finally has swallowed somepolitically unpopular cuts in domestic military bases.   Woodworth said there were 14,562 Army and Air Force slots inEurope on intermediate-range missile assignments that will beeliminated by the fall of 1990.   But he said only 5,685 of them are going to be withdrawn fromEurope. He said the rest will be reassigned ``to requirements thatcould not be accomplished earlier ... and to needed enhancement ofour European defense posture.''   To deal with congressional insistence that the INF missile cutsbe accompanied by real cuts in personnel and costs, the currentplan is to have about 8,000 slots cut in the United States insteadof in Europe.   Those manpower reductions would show up in the rosters of FortCarson, Colo.   Ireland said estimates of defense savings made possible by theINF treaty range as high as $2 billion, but he said they'll neverbe realized if the personnel involved ``are squirreled away inother European posts.''   But the starting point assumption seems to be that Americantroops will stay in Europe, in about their current number, for theforeseeable future.   Ireland says it's become a sort of entitlement program, like thedomestic social programs in which the law says who'll get benefits,automatically and usually permanently.   The question of sharing that defense burden is among the issueswaiting for President Bush as he journeys to Brussels next week forthe 40th anniversary NATO summit meeting.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Walter R.
