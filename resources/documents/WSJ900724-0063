DouglasSosnik, political director, says: &quot;For the past year therehave been a significant number of members with safe seats whoare already preparing for potentially tough races in 1992.&quot;   This linkage of two election cycles by campaignstrategists is quite rare, and the result of three factors:changes in campaign finance law, the reapportionment andredistricting that will follow the 1990 census and the makeupof the Senate class that comes up for re-election in 1992.These factors should combine over the next two electioncycles to produce a record number of retirements, as well assubstantial turnover in both the House and Senate.</LP><TEXT>   During the five elections of the 1980s, an average ofabout 31 House members chose not to seek re-election. That'sdown significantly from the previous decade, when an averageof about 41 members retired or sought other office. But in1992 alone, at least six dozen congressmen are likely todecide against seeking re-election. Combine the 27representatives who are not seeking re-election in 1990 withthe at least six dozen likely to bow out in 1992, and youhave about a quarter of the current membership back homeafter 1992. (The turnover could be even greater if for anyreason -- abortion, Sandamp;Ls -- there is a national electoraltide against one of the parties, as in 1982, or againstincumbents in general.)   Reapportionment has already had a significant impact onthis year's House races, as incumbents focus theirre-election energies on parts of their districts they thinkwill gain importance after boundaries are redrawn andcampaign strategists recruit candidates for this race with aneye toward the new districts of 1992. More than a fewcongressmen will find themselves without districts in 1992,since as many as a dozen states could lose at least one seatbecause of population shifts and a handful of larger statesin the Northeast and Midwest will lose at least two seats.These congressmen will have to retire, run against otherincumbents or seek election to a different office.   But while redistricting will bring political challenges toincumbents, 1992 is likely to be best remembered as the yearwhen dozens of veteran House members took the money and ran.   House members who took office after Jan. 8, 1980, may notconvert campaign funds to private use. But congressmen whowere sworn in by that date were &quot;grandfathered&quot; by earlierlegislation and can take campaign funds with them when theyleave the House. Due to changes adopted by Congress lastyear, however, any officeholder seeking re-election in 1992will automatically lose the right to convert those funds.   With 79 grandfathered members having more than $200,000 intheir campaign accounts at the end of March (to say nothingof the 89 grandfathered members who will run for re-electionthis year and have less than $200,000 on hand), it wouldn'tbe surprising to see dozens of veteran lawmakers opt forretirement. Add the 21 members who will reach at least 70years of age in 1992 but don't yet have at least $200,000 onhand, and you have another reason for a record Houseturnover.   Naturally, not all members who are eligible to convertcampaign funds will choose to do so. Some simply don't needthe extra cash, and others are in such powerful positions orhave such long careers ahead that they can resist thetemptation. But the change in campaign law will prove to be astrong incentive for retirement, especially to members forwhom retirement is a consideration anyway.   With more Republican than Democratic senators up forre-election this year (18 vs. 16, before the death ofDemocratic Sen. Spark Matsunaga of Hawaii), GOP strategistsbegan this cycle just hoping to maintain their 45 seats inthe Senate. But a strong class of candidates this year hasgiven the Republicans at least an outside chance of endingDemocratic control of the Senate. Even a GOP gain of a seator two in November would place the party in excellent shapefor 1992, when 20 Democratic senators and only 14 Republicansare up for election. For the GOP, then, 1990 is a steppingstone to 1992, a presidential election year when the partyhas a realistic chance of regaining control of the Senate.   The Senate class of 1992 offers plenty of opportunitiesfor ambitious politicians and would-be politicians. At leastthree incumbents -- California Democrat Alan Cranston, NewYork Republican Alfonse D'Amato and Washington Democrat BrockAdams -- have suffered from the sort of negative publicitythat usually terminates a political career.   Sen. Cranston, who has been hurt by his relationship withfinancial wheeler-dealer and campaign contributor CharlesKeating, would face a serious primary challenge if he were toseek re-election. At least five congressmen -- DemocratsBarbara Boxer, Robert Matsui, Tom Lantos and Mel Levine andRepublican David Dreier -- have been mentioned as possibleCalifornia Senate hopefuls, and other congressmen might beinterested. Reps. Levine and Dreier, in particular, have beensquirreling away money for years, anticipating a statewidebid. Both have about $1.5 million in the bank.   If California Republican Sen. Pete Wilson is electedgovernor this November, the state's voters will have to fillhis seat as well in 1992.   In New York, Sen. D'Amato has been hurt politicallybecause of his alleged role in the HUD scandal, as well as bysuggestions that he used his influence to help largecontributors to his campaign. Among those mentioned asopponents are former Rep. Geraldine Ferraro, New York stateAttorney-General Robert Abrams, Rep. Thomas Downey and Rep.Stephen Solarz, who had almost $1.5 million in the bank atthe end of March. And in Washington, Sen. Brock Adams hasbeen embarrassed by charges that he made sexual advancestoward the daughter of a longtime friend. Republican Rep. RodChandler is mentioned as a likely opponent.   Other senators up for re-election in 1992 seem likely todraw credible challengers. Besides Sen. Cranston, two othersof the &quot;Keating Five&quot; -- Democrat John Glenn of Ohio andRepublican John McCain of Arizona -- are up in 1992, andSenate races in Idaho, Oregon, Wisconsin and a number ofSouthern states should produce interesting races. All theseopportunities should attract a record crop of House membersintent on moving up the political ladder or looking for a newopportunity following redistricting. The nature of the 1992Senate class, then, should add further to House turnover.   Some Republican optimists look to 1992 as the year whenthe GOP takes over the House. But while unusual circumstanceswill combine to create an unusually large number of openseats, over the past few years the Democrats have proved farmore adept at winning supposedly competitive races. Still,the likelihood of six dozen House vacancies will give bothparties what they have been clamoring for: an opportunity totest their appeal in districts without entrenched incumbents.   ---   Mr. Rothenberg, a Washington political analyst, is editorand publisher of the Political Report.   ---                  House `Grandfathers'                                                                                                                  Members with over $400,000 in campaign               Kitties (As of March 31,1990)                                                                                                          Rostenkowski     D., Ill.       $1,504,346   Solarz           D., N.Y.        1,468,224   Brooks           D., Texas         769,718   Foley            D., Wash.         712,598   Moorhead         R., Calif.        702,952   Matsui           D., Calif.        702,090   Hopkins          R., Ky.           663,523   Broomfield       R., Mich.         658,741   Markey           D., Mass.         631,930   Archer           R., Texas         629,429   Lent             R., N.Y.          604,560   Fascell          D., Fla.          597,308   Barnard          D., Ga.           559,048   Bevill           D., Ala.          558,186   Donnelly         D., Mass.         547,537   Gibbons          D., Fla.          543,417   LaFalce          D., N.Y.          522,266   Waxman           D., Calif.        489,695   Dingell          D., Mich.         489,542   Rahall           D., W.Va.         479,237   Miller           D., Calif.        477,423   Downey           D., N.Y.          476,816   Jenkins          D., Ga.           456,047   Madigan          R., Ill.          452,520   Whitten          D., Miss.         445,864   Moakley          D., Mass.         412,543   Hammerschmidt    R., Ark.          407,204   Dickinson        R., Ala.          405,023                                                                                                          Source: Federal Election Commission</TEXT></DOC>
