The scientists, who are coming from some of the nation's majorindustries and universities, will gather at Argonne NationalLaboratory near suburban Lemont.   Alan Schriesheim, Argonne's director, said President Reaganallotted $12.6 million in his proposed fiscal 1989 budget to theresearch, development and construction at Argonne of the machine _called a synchroton.   Congress has not yet passed the funding for the project. ButSchriesheim said he is optimistic lawmakers will approve thefunding because of the synchroton's ``extraordinary variety'' ofapplications in pure science and industry.   The machine would produce the most intense and powerful X-raybeams ever generated and will be used to help scientists explainthe interior of matter, Schriesheim said in a telephone interviewMonday night.   Industry has taken a keen interest in the development of themachine, named the 7GeV Advanced Photon Source.   ``The machine has already attracted more industrialparticipation in the planning and design stages than any basicresearch machine ever built in the country,'' said David Baurac, anArgonne spokesman.   Some of the 7GeV Advanced Photon Source's applications would bein the petroleum, bio-medical, semiconductor, computer and airplaneindustries, Schriesheim said.   Future applications might include the creation of a plasticstronger than steel, faster computer chips and improved diagnosisof heart disease, he said.   International Business Machines Corp of Armonk, N.Y, AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph Co. of New York, Boeing Co. of Seattle, andExxon Corp. of New York are among the businesses expected to attendthe two-day meeting to help design the machine to meet their needs,Schriesheim said.   Three hundred scientists are expected to attend the meeting,Baurac said.   Argonne hopes to begin constructing the machine in late 1988 orearly 1989. The machine will take about seven years to build, andits construction would generate 1,500 jobs, Baurac said.   Once built, 300 scientists and technical staff members would runthe machine, and about 1,000 scientists from industry, universitiesand other laboratories would use it each year, Baurac said.   The synchroton works by taking positrons and accelerating themalmost to the speed of light. The synchroton then usessophisticated arrays of magnets to wiggle the beam violently togenerate ``the brightest beams of X-rays in the world'', Bauracsaid.   Positrons are ``like electrons with positive charges,'' Bauracsaid.</TEXT></DOC>
