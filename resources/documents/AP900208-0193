The leader of the Guides, who count Queen Elizabeth II as theirmost famous former member, was less than thrilled at theannouncement and said she hoped the Scouts didn't plan to raid herorganization for members.   The Boy Scouts of America has allowed girls, ages 6-15, tobelong to its Explorer Division for about 19 years, according tonational spokesman Lee Sneath.   ``The Explorer Posts are co-ed, so it's not like we have a troopof girls and a troop of boys,'' Sneath said in Dallas. ``They'reintermingled and they do exactly the same things.''   Chief Scout Garth Morrison said in announcing the BritishScouts' decision that local Scout chapters will be able to choosewhether to admit girls because some ``want nothing to do withgirls.'' Nobody would be forced to have them, he said.   ``We are aware that in some places there is a pressing need forit and we are anxious to meet that need. It is an important moveand a move in the right direction,'' Morrison said.   Nicola Lowes, 14, turned down in October when she and twofriends applied to join the Scout group in Wark, northern England,said she would reapply Monday.   ``I was in the Guides for a little while but I thought it wasreally boring,'' she said. ``Scouts seem more active and you getoutdoors more.   ``I was really upset when I was turned down. I kept asking themwhy, it just wasn't fair.   ``I think the boys will be for it, they treat us just the sameas they are.''   Bob Hogarth, Scout leader of the Wark troop, said: ``The threegirls have been campaigning strongly, and personally I am in favorof it. We had discussions with the boys in the troop who are aged10 to 15 and they were in favor of it too.''   Morrison, a former navy lieutenant, said the Scout movementwould be opened to girls aged six to 15, with the first girl scoutsprobably enrolled in 1991.   Older girls were allowed to join Britain's Venture Scouts in1976 and there are 11,000 of them now _ about a quarter of thetotal membership.   Girl Guides' Chief Commissioner June Paterson-Brown said she was``very angry'' when she learned of the move. The two groups hadjust finished a two-year joint study on greater cooperation.   ``I am extremely disappointed,'' she said, but added, ``I hopewe are big enough to say that if the Scouts want this, it's theirdecision. It really depends if the Scouts target our girls. If theytry to poach our girls then it will make things very difficult.''   Morrison said girl and boy scouts would have separate tents,toilets, and washing facilities on camping trips, with men andwomen leaders.   A Scout spokesman said there were 680,000 British Scouts and alot of pressure had built up by girls eager to join, attracted bythe more adventurous activities.   Scouts frequently hike and camp out, but Guides don't go campingas often.</TEXT></DOC>
