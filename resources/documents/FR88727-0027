The clarification is necessary becauseof recent appellate decisions calling into question the pre-existing authorityof the Board of Immigration Appeals (Board), and concomitantly the immigrationjudges, to pretermit evidentiary hearings on such applications and to denythem because of ineligibility. This proposed rule would also remove languagethat does not reflect the actual procedure before immigration judges consideringasylum applications in deportation or exclusion proceedings.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Written comments must be received on or before August 26,1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Please submit written comments in triplicate to GeraldS.

First, section 243(h) of the Immigrationand Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1253(h), provides for the withholding ofdeportation as to certain aliens by specifying that the Attorney Generalshall not deport an alien to a country if the alien's life or freedom wouldbe threatened in that country on account of race, religion, nationality,membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. Second,section 208 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1158, requiresthe Attorney General to establish procedures for aliens who have managedto get to the United States to apply for asylum, and permits the AttorneyGeneral to grant asylum, in his discretion, to any such alien who qualifiesas a refugee because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecutionon account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular socialgroup, or political opinion.Section 243(h) withholding of deportation is mandatory for qualiftyingaliens. However, section 243(h)(2) specifically excludes from protectioncertain aliens, regardless of whether their lives or freedom would be threatenedupon return to the country of prospective deportation. The statute thusstates that its benefits ``shall not apply to any alien if the AttorneyGeneral determines that_(A) the alien ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwiseparticipated in the persecution of any person * * * ; (B) the alien, havingbeen convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime, constitutesa danger to the community of the United States; (C) there are serious reasonsfor consideration that the alien has committed a serious nonpolitical crimeoutside the United States prior to [his] arrival * * * ; or (D) there arereasonable grounds for regarding the alien as a danger to the securityof the United States.''Section 208, the discretionary asylum provision, contains no such mandatorydenial grounds, except that an alien must be a ``refugee'' to qualify forayslum, and aliens who have persecuted others cannot qualify as ``refugees''under 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(42). By regulation, however, the grounds for themandatory denial of withholding of deportation were incorporated into theprovisions requiring the denial of asylum applications presented to districtdirectors of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 8 CFR 208.8(f)(1987). The obvious intent of this regulation was to exercise the AttorneyGereral's discretion in such a fashion as to preclude a grant of asylumfor an alien who Congress had barred from obtaining even the more limited,country specific relief of withholding of deportation.The design of the regulation, however, was imperfect; it did not specificallyextend to the adjudication of asylum applications by immigration judgesand the Board of Immigration Appeals in exclusion and deportation proceedings.This proposal would eliminate any question in this respect. In addition,both immigration judges and the Board have long exercised authority tolimit the scope of their inquiry, and thus the scope of the necessary factualhearing, on applications for various forms of relief from deportation,if it became obvious that relief ultimately would be denied either in theexercise of discretion or because of statutory ineligibility. This procedurehas allowed the immigration judges and the Board to dispense with evidentiaryhearings on issues relating to the application that are unnecessary tothe resolution of the particular case. Indeed, the Supreme Court has upheldthe authority of the Board to avoid unnecessary inquiry into all aspectsof an alien's claim for relief when a dispositive ground can be identified.<T3>INS v. Bagamasbad,</T3> 429 U.S. 24 (1976).<T3> See INS v. Rios-Pineda,</T3> 105 S.Ct. 2098 (1985); <T3>INS v. Phinpathya,</T3> 464 U.S. 183 (1984); <T3>INS v. Jong Ha Wang,</T3> 450 U.S. 139 (1981).Recently, however, the authority of the Board and immigration judges topretermit unnecessary evidentiary hearings, specifically in connectionwith asylum applications, has been called into question in some circuits.<T3>Arauz v. Rivkind,</T3> 834 F.2d 979 (11th Cir. Dec. 31, 1987), <T3>Petition for rehearing filed</T3> (Feb. 19, 1988); <T3>Castro-O'Ryan v. INS,</T3> 821 F.2d 1415 (9th Cir. 1987), <T3>Petition for rehearing filed</T3> (Aug. 27, 1987); <T3>Shahandeh/Pey v. INS,</T3> 831 F.2d 1384 (7th Cir. 1987). In <T3>Arauz v. Rivkind,</T3> for example, the Eleventh Circuit concludedthat an immigration judge had erred in refusing to take evidence on thelikelihood of an alien's persecution abroad, despite the fact that theimmigration judge found the alien not to merit a favorable exercise ofdiscretion because he had been convicted of conspiracy to possess withintent to distribute marijuana. The Court in <T3>Arauz</T3> reached its decision by focusing largely on the precisewording of the regulations respecting asylum determinations, and particularlyon those aspects of the regulations which, in 8 CFR 208.10(c), providethat an alien ``may present evidence for the record,'' and which, in 8CFR 208.10(f), limit the binding effect of a criminal conviction for anadmittedly ``particularly serious crime'' to INS district director asylumdecisions.The purpose of the proposed rule is to overcome the line of decisions,represented by <T3>Arauz,</T3> which would require full evidentiary hearings on all aspectsof asylum claims, and to correct the oversight in the regulations respectingthe applicability of the mandatory grounds for denial of asylum applicationsto any such claims advanced in deportation and exclusion proceedings. Theproposed rule would accomplish this by changing the regulations in tworespects. First, with one exception, it would make the grounds for themandatory denial of asylum that presently apply to such applications beforedistrict directors (i.e., those applications made outside of deportationand exclusion proceedings) also clearly apply to applications that aremade in the context of exclusion and deportation proceedings before immigrationjudges. Second, it would make it clear that immigration judges have theauthority to limit evidentiary hearings on asylum claims to only thosematters they find to be dispositive of the application, and that no inquiryis necessary respecting questions beyond the issues controlling the outcomeof the case.This proposed rule would add new language to 8 CFR 208.10(c) to make itclear that a full hearing is not required with respect to issues that donot form the basis for the resolution of a case. There are presently 69immigration judges sitting nationwide to hear cases. In Fiscal Year 1987,these judges received 86,873 new cases, including 8,659 asylum applications,and the Board received 8,204 new appeals. The effect of the <T3>Arauz</T3> decision, as well as the other similar cases, would be torequire prolonged evidentiary hearings exploring issues that are irrelevantto the decision. If it is apparent at the outset, or early on in the process,that the alien is ineligible for asylum or withholding of deportation,the immigration judge should be able to forgo an evidentiary hearing onquestions extraneous to the decision. By authorizing the pretermissionof an evidentiary hearing, the immigration judge can dispense with unnecessaryand time consuming factual hearings on nondispositive issues. The limitedimmigration judge resources will thus be better employed in addressingother cases, rather than in continuing to explore nondeterminative questionsin asylum cases.The immigration judge fact-finder can continue to have the flexibilityto address the issues that are, in his discretion, appropriate to the adjudicationof the application. He can, for example, hear evidence on only the claimof persecution, or on only a ground for the possible mandatory denial (e.g.,a criminal record), or on both persecution and possible grounds for themandatory or discretionary denial of the claim, depending on what appearswarranted by the facts of each case. The immigration judge, however, wouldnot be required to follow an inflexible approach respecting the scope ofthe hearing on the persecution aspects of the case.A corresponding change is proposed to andSection; 208.10(b), which dealswith the adjournment of exclusion and deportation proceedings to obtainadvisory opinions from the Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairsof the Department of State. The new language would not require such anadjournment if an alien were barred from asylum by virtue of certain groundsset forth in andSection; 208.8(f). This would merely reflect the currentinterpretation of this provision by the Board. <T3>Matter of Carballe,</T3> <T2>XX</T2> Iandamp;N Dec. <T2>XX</T2>, Interim Decision 3007 (BIA 1986).In additon, andSection; 208.10(f) would be amended by extending to immigrationjudge and Board determinations the mandatory grounds for denial of asylumalready found in andSection; 208.8(f)(1) and applicable before district directors,with one exception. In keeping with the proposed regulations covering allaspects of asylum adjudications, which are published at 53 FR 11300 (April6, 1988), evidence of criminal activity not subject to United States jurisdictionwhich would preclude withholding of deportation is not retained as a <T3>mandatory</T3> basis for denial of asylum, but will be considered inconnection with the exercise of discretion. An alien must show a greater chance of his being persecuted in order tobe eligible for witholding of deportation than to be eligible for asylum.<T3>Compare INS v Cardoze-Fonseca, </T3><T2>XX</T2> U.S.<T2>XX</T2>, 107 S.Ct. 1207 (1987), <T3>with INS v. Stevic, </T3>467 U.S. 407 (1984). Notwithstanding boththe required showing of a threat to life of freedom, and the higher probabilityof persecution necessary to obtain relief under section 243(h), Congressdeclared that certain conduct would be an absolute bar to a grant of withholdingof deportation, such as an alien's conviction for a particularly seriouscrime. Although the asylum statue contains no similar absolute preclusion,conduct which is serious enough to preclude withholding of deportationwould, in general, also appear serious enough to bar a grant of asylum,regardless of the other factors present in the case. This approach haslong been reflected in the regulations governing district director adjudications.Except for the change, reference above, respecting foreign criminal activity,the proposed rule merely would bring the regulations governing immigrationjudge determinations into conformity with the rule that now governs thedistrict directors. The current language contained in andSection; 208.10(f) would be deleted,because it does not reflect the actual procedure that is used for the consideraionof asylum and withholding of deportation applications before immigrantionjudges. This revision would bring the section into conformity with theprocedure outlined in andSection;andSection; 236.3(a) and 242.17(c). Finally, this minor set of revisions to the existing asylum regulationsis being proposed at this time, notwithstanding the more comprehensiverevision that is already under consideration. See 53 FR 11300 (April 6,1988); 52 FR 32552 (Aug. 28, 1987); 52 FR 46776 (Dec. 10, 1987). That morecomprehensive package of asylum regulations is likely to be subject togreater comment and debate than is this modest proposal, and the ultimateeffective date of any comprehensive rulemaking will likely be delayed becauseof the implementation problems associated with the magnitude of the proposedchanges to the system. No similar administrative difficulties should beconnected with this minor correction. Moreover, there is need for an immediatecorrection, because of the potentional adverse impact of decisions suchas <T3>Arauz v. Rivkind</T3> on the immigration judge hearing process. Inaccordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Attorney General certifies that thisrule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities. This is not a major rule within the meaning of secton 1(b) of E.O. 12291.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 8 CFR Part 208</ITAG>Aliens, Asylum, Immigration.Accordingly, it is proposed to amend Chapter I of Title 8 of the Code ofFederal Regulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 208_ASYLUM PROCEDURES</ITAG>1.
