We've had too much outflow of funds.&quot;    Her ailing, 89-year-old husband has already given more than $400 this year to a flag-waving political action committee whose professional fund-raisers keep calling and sending letters asking for more. He was a military officer before he retired years ago, says the wife, who asked not to be identified. But now he has trouble hearing and his mind isn't what it used to be, she says. &quot;I wish I could stop him from giving, but I can't. . . . Those things sound good, to someone who's been a loyal American and loyal to his country.&quot;    The woman and her husband are targets of,a political action committee that has been soliciting elderly and sometimes mentally incompetent retirees throughout the country by appealing to their patriotism and, lately, by invoking the name of Vice President George Bush and Republican senators without their knowledge or permission.    Calling itself the National Security Political Action Committee, it has reported raising and spending roughly half a million dollars since popping up last year. But its filings at the Federal Election Commission show it has given only $12,700 to political candidates, all of them Republicans and most of them losers in the last election. At the same time, 97.4% of the money has gone to pay operating costs, including $321,000 to companies controlled by two Virginia-based fund-raisers, and nearly $47,000 in compensation for its founder.    The Bush campaign's general counsel, Jan Baran, denounces the PAC's operators as &quot;bloodsuckers&quot; and threatens to ask postal authorities to investigate. But PAC founder Elizabeth Fediay (pronounced fedEYE) says she's doing her best to avoid taking advantage of senior citizens.    &quot;That is a valid problem,&quot; she says. &quot;I'm very sensitive about this issue.&quot;    Miss Fediay recently returned several checks totaling $1,500 to an 86-year-old widow in California, who recently checked herself into a nursing home and turned over her financial affairs to a friend. Miss Fediay recalls, however, that she sent back the checks not out of sympathy but because the widow didn't have funds to cover them.    &quot;She's very forgetful, very confused, completely confused,&quot; says the widow's friend. &quot;She sits down and writes them checks, sometimes two at a time. . . . She's very sympathetic to any cause, it doesn't matter what it is.&quot; The widow wrote $825 in checks to the PAC last year and $2,900 more this year before her account ran dry.    Also confused was an aged donor from upstate New York. She mistook a reporter's call for another fund-raising pitch from the PAC. &quot;I'm cutting way back on contributions,&quot; the woman snapped. &quot;I'm 88 and can't afford it.&quot;    So why did she send in half a dozen checks totaling more than $700 last year, and $300 this year? &quot;I was foolish,&quot; she said. &quot;Why should I put money into something like that? Give me one good reason. I happen to be a woman who stands up for my rights, and how!&quot; Then she hung up.    Yet another donor, an 80-year-old retired librarian living on her savings in North Carolina, couldn't remember giving to the PAC and had to consult her check stubs to confirm that she had indeed given. The PAC lists her as giving $740 this year.    &quot;I may need a keeper and not know it,&quot; said the librarian. &quot;It was supposed to be for charity of some kind. . . . To benefit children, I don't mind giving a reasonable amount.&quot;    This donor says she doesn't follow politics very much but does recall voting for Democratic candidate Terry Sanford in last year's Senate election. Among the few donations made by the PAC, however, was a $1,000 donation to the man Mr. Sanford defeated, Republican James Broyhill.    Miss Fediay's PAC just launched a new project it calls &quot;Americans for Bush,&quot; telephoning for pledges and following up with breathless mailgrams. &quot;Confirming your $250 pledge,&quot; said one sent to a retired chemical-company worker in Florida. &quot;Liberals attacking Reagan and Bush for wanting to support freedom fighters in Nicaragua. . . . Your contribution is vital to Bush's urgent battle against liberals.&quot;    The retiree has given more than $4,000 to several PACs and GOP committees during the last two and a half years, and says fund-raisers call him constantly. &quot;Some fella called me up the other day and talked to me about Bush,&quot; he said. &quot;And he said, 'Would you give him some money,' and I said, 'Yes.'&quot;    This donor, however, somehow sent the money to the real Bush campaign and enclosed the mailgram from Miss Fediay's operation. Thus alerted, officials for Mr. Bush's campaign were furious at Miss Fediay and her fund-raising consultants. &quot;We don't approve of what they are doing,&quot; says Mr. Baran. &quot;To the extent that they are making misrepresentations to the public, we intend to file a protest and request that the postal authorities do something.&quot;    Miss Fediay is also signing fund-raising letters as &quot;national chairman&quot; of the &quot;1988 Senate Victory Fund,&quot; appealing for money to fend off a &quot;massive liberal onslaught&quot; aimed at Republican Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah, Paul Trible of Virginia, Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming and Chic Hecht of Nevada. Her letter invokes their names 14 times, but she hasn't yet given a dollar to any of them and concedes she didn't ask permission. &quot;Just the opposite,&quot; she says. &quot;We maintain autonomy.&quot;    Despite her use of the plural pronoun, Miss Fediay is the PAC's only officer and sole employee. Her letterhead lists the address as &quot;Suite 420&quot; at a building here in Washington that turns out to be her own two-story brick house. She lists a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Thomas Moorer, as a &quot;national security adviser&quot; to the PAC, but Adm. Moorer says, &quot;I haven't spent 20 minutes on this.&quot;    Another retired admiral who is listed as an adviser, C.A. Hill, says the PAC's tactics aren't much different from those used by others. &quot;All kinds of people are doing this, both sides of the aisle,&quot; he says.    Indeed, puffery is a staple of the fund-raising business. &quot;You're not selling a product; you're selling air,&quot; says David Kunko, one of Miss Fediay's fund-raising consultants. Furthermore, older people give more than others. Mr. Kunko says that Republican donors average more than 60 years old, and that the National Conservative Political Action Committee, another right-leaning group for which he has worked, found in a study of its donors that they averaged 72.    Sometimes older people give too much, he concedes; &quot;We've heard of people who send in their Social Security check.&quot; And while he and Miss Fediay say they remove anyone from their lists who asks, that doesn't get them off of every one of the many fund-raising lists that are rented back and forth among political groups.    So the mail keeps pouring in. The California widow moved to a nursing home June 1, and now her friend's mailbox overflows with forwarded letters from rightwing causes, Republican presidential candidates and GOP party groups. &quot;Sometimes there will be two and three from the same outfit on the same day,&quot; the friend says.    &quot;One said, 'Joan Baez would like you to throw this in the garbage.' And I did.&quot;    ---   Disbursement of National Security PAC    (May 1986-June 1987)   Campaign donations... $ 12,700 2.59%    Operating Expenses... $478,436  97.41%   Total................ $491,136    Source: Federal Election Commission</TEXT></DOC>
