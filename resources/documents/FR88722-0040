Sparrowe, Chief, Officeof Migratory Bird Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Departmentof the Interior, Washington, DC 20240 (202-254-3207).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The Migratory Bird Treaty Act of July3, 1918 (40 Stat. 755; 16 U.S.C. 703 <T3>et seq</T3>.) authorizes and directs the Secretary of the Interior,having due regard for the zones of temperature and for the distribution,abundance, economic value, breeding habits, and times and lines of flightof migratory game birds, to determine when, to what extent, and by whatmeans such birds or any part, nest or egg thereof may be taken, hunted,captured, killed, possessed, sold, purchased, shipped, carried, exportedor transported.In the January 21, 1988 <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 1645), the Service requested proposalsfrom Indian tribes that wished to establish special migratory bird huntingregulations for the 1988-89 hunting season, under the interim guidelinesdescribed in the June 4, 1988 <T4>Federal Register</T4> (at 50 FR 23467). The guidelines were developedin response to tribal requests for Service recognition of their reservedhunting rights, and for some tribes, recognition of their authority toregulate hunting by both tribal and nontribal members on their reservations.The guidelines include possibilities for: (1) On-reservation hunting byboth tribal and nontribal members, with hunting by nontribal members onsome reservations to take place within Federal frameworks but on datesdifferent from those selected by the surrounding State(s); (2) on-reservationhunting by tribal members only, outside of usual Federal frameworks forseason dates and length, and for daily bag and possession limits; and (3)off-reservation hunting by tribal members on ceded lands, outside of usualframework dates and season length, with some added flexibility in dailybag and possession limits. In all cases, the regulations established underthe guidelines would have to be consistent with the March 10 to September1 closed season mandated by the 1916 Migratory Bird Treaty with Canada.The guidelines are capable of application to those tribes that have recognizedreserved hunting rights on Federal Indian reservations (including off-reservationtrust lands) and on ceded lands. They also apply to establishing migratorybird hunting regulations for nontribal members on all lands within theexterior boundaries of reservations where tribes have full wildlife managementauthority over such hunting or where the tribes and affected States otherwisehave reached agreement over hunting by nontribal members on lands ownedby non-Indians within the reservationTribes usually have the authority to regulate migratory bird hunting bynonmembers on Indian-owned reservation lands, subject to Service approval.The question of jurisdiction is more complex on reservations that includelands owned by non-Indians, especially when the surrounding States haveestablished or intend to establish regulations governing hunting by non-Indianson these lands. In such cases, the Service encourages the tribes and Statesto reach agreement on regulations that would apply throughout the reservations.Whenappropriate, the Service will consult with a tribe and State with the aimof facilitating an accord. The Service also will consult jointly with tribaland State officials in the affected States where tribes may wish to establishspecial hunting regulations for tribal members on ceded lands.One of the guidelines provides for the continuation of harvest of waterfowland other migratory game birds by tribal members on reservations whereit is a customary practice. The Service does not oppose this harvest, providedit does not take place during the closed season required by the 1916 CanadianMigratory Bird Treaty, and it is not so large as to adversely affect thestatus of the migratory bird resource.Before developing the guidelines, the Service reviewed available informationon the current status of migratory bird hunting on Federal Indian reservationsand evaluated the impact that adoption of the guidelines likely would haveon migratory birds. The Service has concluded that the size of the migratorybird harvest by tribal members hunting on their reservations is too smallto have significant impacts on the migratory bird resource when comparedwith the much larger off-reservation sport harvest by non-Indians. Themajor area of concern relates to hunting seasons for nontribal memberson dates that are within Federal frameworks, but that are different fromthose established by the State(s) in which a Federal Indian reservationis located. A large influx of nontribal hunters onto a reservation at atime when the season is closed in the surrounding State(s) could resultin adverse harvest impacts on one or more migratory bird species. The guidelinesmake such an event unlikely, however, because tribal proposals must includedetails on the harvest anticipated under the requested regulations; methodsthat will be employed to measure or monitor harvest (bag checks, mail questionnaires,etc.); steps that will be taken to limit level of harvest, where it couldbe shown that failure to limit such harvest would impact seriously on themigratory bird resource; and tribal capabilities to establish and enforcemigratory bird hunting regulations. Based on a review of tribal proposals,the Service may require modifications, and regulations may be establishedexperimentally, pending evaluation and confirmation of harvest informationobtained by the tribes.The Service believes that the guidelines provide appropriate opportunityto accommodate the reserved hunting rights and management authority ofIndian tribes while ensuring that the migratory bird resource receivesnecessary protection. The conservation of this important internationalresource is paramount. The guidelines should not be viewed as inflexible.Nevertheless, the Service notes that they have been employed successfullysince 1985 to establish special hunting regulations for Indian tribes.Therefore, the Service believes that they have been tested adequately andproposed to make them final for the 1988-89 season. It should be stressedhere, however, that use of the guidelines is not necessary and no actionis required if a tribe wishes to observe the hunting regulations establishedby the State(s) in which the reservation is located.<ITAG tagnum="85">Review of Comments Received on Notice Requesting Hunting Season ProposalsFrom Indian Tribes</ITAG>In a June 7, 1988 letter from The Wildlife Legislative Fund of America,James H. Glass, President, commented on the January 21, 1988 <T4>Federal Register</T4> in which the Service requested tribal proposals.In his letter, Mr. Glass recongized that differential treatment of Indiansin the taking of wildlife is due to treaties made in the past. However,he pointed out that the Wildlife Legislative Fund of America has protestedthe discriminatory use of special regulations for Indians in the past,and he asked the Service to (1) join with others who also object, and (2)explain for the non-Indian majority the specific reasons for the continuinguse of discriminatory regulations.In response, the Service recognizes that special migratory bird huntingregulations for Indians are viewed as discriminatory by some people. TheService notes, however, that Indian tribes on most Federal Indian reservationshave reserved hunting rights recognized or granted by treaty, executiveorder, statute, agreement, or other law. These reserved hunting rightsare subject to reasonable and necessary nondiscriminatory conservationmeasures. The taking of waterfowl and other migratory game birds is a traditionalpractice by tribal members on many reservations. The Service believes thatthis harvest is small when compared with the sport harvest by non-Indiansand does not oppose harvest by Indians provided it is not excessive anddoes not occur during the annual closed period required by the Canadianmigratory bird treaty. In this manner, the reserved hunting rights of Indiansare accommodated while the conservation goals of the treaty are satisfied.The Service recently employed the guidelines to reach agreement with theMille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians, Vineland, Minnesota, for on-reservationhunting by tribal members during the 1988-89 hunting season and reacheda similar agreement last year. In addition, the Service currently is consultingwith the Klamath Tribe, Chiloquin, Oregon, in regard to 1988-89 huntingregulations. The regulations would apply to hunting by members on certainlands within the exterior boundaries of the tribe's former reservation,under the general conditions of a Federal court decision. The Service willcontinue to work toward mutually acceptable hunting regulations for othertribes that may wish to reach an accord.The Service should also point out that some Indian tribes have the judiciallyrecognized right to hunt migratory birds under special conditions on off-reservationceded lands. Thus far, only the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission,representing Chippewa Indians in Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, hasasked for special migratory bird regulations for hunting on off-reservationceded lands. The annual harvest by these Indians has been small.The Service continues to believe that the greatest potential for excessiveharvest is on reservations where tribes have established hunting programsto attract nontribal members, and where the hunting regulations would bewithin Federal frameworks but on dates that are different than those establishedby the State(s) in which a reservation is located. The migratory bird harvestis monitored on such reservations to ensure that the harvest does not haveadverse effects.<ITAG tagnum="84">Hunting Season Proposals From Indian Tribes and Organizations</ITAG>In addition to the Mille Lacs Band and the Klamath Tribe, the Service receivedrequests from eight tribes and Indian organizations for special migratorybird hunting regulations for the 1988-89 hunting season. Each of them hadspecial regulations in the 1987-88 hunting season.The proposed regulations for the different tribes are shown below. It shouldbe noted that this proposed rule, and a final rule to be published laterin an August 1988 <T4>Federal Register,</T4> will include tribal regualtions for both earlyand late hunting seasons. The early season begins on September 1 each yearand includes species such as mourning doves and white-winged doves. Thelate season usually begins on or around October 1 and includes most waterfowlspecies. Because final regulations for Indian tribes must be establishedby September 1, the proposed and final regulations for most tribal huntingseasons are described in relation to the season dates, season length, andlimits that will be permitted when final Federal frameworks are announcedfor early and late season regulations. For example, the daily bag and possessionlimits for ducks on reservations in the Southwestern United States willbe shown as ``Same as permitted Pacific Flyway States under final Federalframeworks to be announced,'' and limits for geese will be shown as thesame that will be permitted the State(s) in which the reservations arelocated. The proposed frameworks for early season regulations are scheduledfor early July publication in the <T4>Federal Register,</T4> and final Federal frameworks will be publishedin early August. Proposed late season frameworks for waterfowl and cootswill be published in mid-August, and the final Federal frameworks for thelate season will be published in a mid-September <T4>Federal Register.</T4> The Service will notify affected tribes of seasondates, bag limits, etc., as soon as final frameworks are established. Asdiscussed earlier in this document, no action is requried by tribes thatwish to observe the migratory bird hunting regulations established by theState in which a reservation is located.1. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, Jicarilla Indian Reservation, Dulce, New MexicoThe Jicarilla Apache Tribe has had special migratory bird hunting regulationsfor tribal members and nonmembers since the 1986-87 hunting season. Thetribe owns all lands on the reservation and has recognized full wildlifemanagement authority.In a May 10, 1988 proposal, the tribe requested the earliest opening datepermitted Pacific Flyway States for ducks for the 1988-89 hunting seasonand a closing date of November 30, 1988. Daily bag and possession limitsalso would be the same as permitted Pacific Flyway States. The tribe requestedthat the season be closed for geese and other migratory game birds. Thetribe conducts a harvest survey each year, and the estimated harvest was1,057 ducks during the past season.The requested regulations are the same as were established last year, andin view of the comparatively small duck harvest that occurred, the Serviceproposes to approve the tribe's request for the 1988-89 hunting season.However, the Service notes that the fall flight of ducks is expected tobe far below normal because of severe drought on major production areasin the prairie regions of Canada and the United States. Consequently, itmay be necessary, as a conservation measure, to establish more restrictivehunting regulations than were employed last year in the Pacific and otherflyways.2. Navajo Nation, Navajo Indian Reservation, Window Rock ArizonaSince 1985, the Service has established uniform migratory bird huntingregulations for tribal members and nonmembers on the Navajo Indian reservation(in parts of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah). The tribe owns almost alllands on the reservation and has full wildlife management authority.In a May 12, 1988 letter, the tribe asked and the Service proposes to establishthe following regulations on the reservation for both tribal members andnonmembers for the 1988-89 hunting season:<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Ducks (including Mergansers)</ITAG><T3>Season Dates: </T3>Earliest opening date and longest season permittedPacific Flyway States under final Federal frameworks to be announced.<T3>Daily Bag and Possession Limits: </T3>Same as permitted Pacific FlywayStates under final Federal frameworks to be announced.<ITAG tagnum="81">B.

Possessionlimit after opening day is 20 mourning and white-winged doves in the aggregate,of which no more than 12 may be white-winged doves.<ITAG tagnum="81">G. General Conditions</ITAG>Tribal members and nonmembers will comply with all basic Federal migratorybird hunting regulations in 50 CFR Part 20 regarding shooting hours andmanner of taking. In addition, each waterfowl hunter 16 years of age orover must carry on his/her person a valid Migratory Bird Hunting and ConservationStamp (Duck Stamp) signed in ink across the face. Special regulations establishedby the Navajo Nation also apply on the reservation.3. Shoshone-Bannock Tribes, Fort Hall Indian Reservation, Fort Hall, IdahoAlmost all of the Fort Hall Indian Reservation is tribally-owned. The tribesclaim full wildlife management authority throughout the reservation, butthe Idaho Fish and Game Department has disputed tribal jurisdiction, especiallyfor hunting by nontribal members on reservation lands owned by non-Indians.As a compromise, since 1985, the Service has established the same waterfowlhunting regulations on the reservation and in a surrounding off-reservationState zone. The regulations were requested by the tribes and provided fordifferent season dates than in the remainder of the State. The Serviceagreed to the season dates because it seemed likely that they would providesome additional protection to mallards and pintails, and the State concurredwith the zoning arrangement. The Service has no objection to the State'suse of this zone in the 1988-89 hunting season, provided the duck and goosehunting season dates are the same as on the reservation. The Shoshone-BannockTribes have requested and the Service proposes to establish the followingmigratory bird hunting regulations for nontribal members on their reservationfor the 1988-89 hunting season:<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Ducks (including Mergansers)</ITAG><T3>Season Length and Dates: </T3>Same season length as permitted PacificFlyway States under final Federal framework to be announced. If 79 huntingdays are permitted, as in 1987-88, tribal season would run continuouslywith later opening and earlier closing closure (e.g., tribal season in1987-88 was October 10-December 27).<T3>Daily Bag and Possession Limits: </T3>Same as permitted Pacific FlywayStates under final Federal frameworks to be announced.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Geese (including Canada, Black Brant, White-fronted and Snow)</ITAG><T3>Season Length and Dates: </T3>Same season length as permitted Idahounder final Federal frameworks to be announced. If 86 days are permitted,as in 1987-88, tribal season would run continuously with later openingand earlier closure (e.g., tribal season in 1987-88 was October 10-January3). Tentatively, tribal duck and goose seasons would begin on same date,preferably a Saturday.<T3>Daily Bag and Possession Limits: </T3>Same as permitted Idaho underfinal Federal framework to be announced.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Coots</ITAG><T3>Season Length and Dates: </T3>Same as for ducks.<T3>Daily Bag and Possession Limits: </T3>Same as permitted Pacific FlywayStates under final Federal frameworks to be announced.<ITAG tagnum="81">D. Common Snipe</ITAG><T3>Season Length and Dates:</T3> Same as for ducks.<T3>Daily Bag and Possession Limits</T3>: 8 daily. Possession limit 16.<ITAG tagnum="81">E. </ITAG><T3>General Conditions</T3>Nontribal members will comply with all basic Federal migratory bird huntingregulations in 50 CFR Part 20 regarding shooting hours and manner of taking.In addition, each waterfowl hunter 16 years of age or over must carry onhis/her person a valid Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation State (DuckStamp) signed in ink across the face. Special regulations established bythe Shoshone-Bannock Tribes aslo apply on the reservation.4. White Mountain Apache Tribe, Fort Apache Indian Reservation, Whiteriver,Arizona The White Mountain Apache Tribe owns all reservation lands, and the tribehas recognized full wildlife management authority. In a June 7, 1988 letter,the tribe requested a continuous waterfowl hunting season with the latestclosing date and longest season permitted under final Federal frameworksto be announced. The tribe requested the same daily bag and possessionlimits for ducks permitted Pacific Flyway States and the same bag and possessionlimits permitted Arizona for geese. Season dates and bag and possessionlimits for band-tailed pigeons will be the same as established by Arizonaunder final Federal frameworks. The regulations will apply both to tribalmembers and nontribal members.The regulations requested by the tribe are the same as were approved lastyear, and the Service proposes to establish them again for the 1988-89hunting season.5. Colorado River Indian Tribes, Colorado River Indian Reservation, Parker,Arizona The Colorado River Indian Reservation is located in Arizona and California.The tribes own almost all lands on the reservation, and they have fullwildlife management authority. Beginning with the 1985 hunting season,the Service, as requested by the tribes, has established the same migratorybird hunting regulations on the reservation as in the Colorado River Zonein California.In a June 6, 1988 proposal, the tribes requested regulations that are almostidentical to those approved last year. As discussed earlier, however, ducknumbers in the fall likely will be much smaller than last year. There isspecial concern regarding the population status of pintails, whose numbershave declined alarmingly in recent years, as well as the status of canvasbacksand other ducks. Consequently, while the regulations frameworks for thesespecies and other ducks have not been announced, it may be necessary toset more restrictive regulations in the 1988-89 hunting season. Therefore,the Service proposes to establish the same migratory hunting regulationson the reservation as will be established for California's Colorado RiverZone. As in the past, the regulations will apply both to tribal membersand nonmembers.6. Penobscot Indian Nation, Old Town, MaineSince June 1985, the Service has approved a general migratory bird huntingseason for both tribal members and monmembers, under regulations adoptedby the State, and a sustenance season that applied only to tribal members.At the Service's request, the tribe has monitored black duck harvest duringeach sustenance season and has confirmed that is is negligible in size.In a June 2, 1988 proposal, the tribe again requested special regulationsfor tribal members in Penobscot Indian Territory, an area of trust landsthat includes but is much larger than the reservation. The tribe proposeda 1988-89 sustenance hunting season of 75 days (September 17-November 30),with a daily bag limit of 4 ducks, including no more that 1 black duckand 2 wood ducks. The daily bag limit for geese would include 3 Canadageese, 3 snow geese, or 3 in the aggregate. When the sustenance and Maine'sgeneral waterfowl season overlap, the daily bag limit for tribal memberswill be only the larger of the two daily bag limits. All other Federalregulations will be observed by tribal members, except that shooting hourswill be from one-half hour before sunrise to one-half after sunset. Nontribalmembers hunting on Penobscot Indian Territory will adhere to the waterfowlhunting regulations established by the State of Maine. The Service notes that the regulations requested by the tribe are nearlyidentical to those established last year and proposes to approve the tribalrequest.7. Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission, Odanah, WisconsinSince 1985, various bands of the Lake Superior Tribe of Chippewa Indianshave exercised judicially recognized off-reservation hunting rights formigratory birds on Wisconsin. The specific regulations were establishedby the Service in consultation with the Wisconsin Department of NaturalResources and the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission (whichrepresents the various bands). Beginning in 1986, the Michigan Departmentof Natural Resources agreed to accommodate a tribal season on ceded landsin the western portion of the State's Upper Peninsula, and the Serviceapproved special regulations for tribal members in both Michigan and Wisconsinduring the 1986-87 and 1987-88 hunting seasons. Last year, the Great LakesIndian Fish and Wildlife Commission requested and the Service approvedspecial regulations to permit tribal members to hunt on ceded lands inMinnesota, as well as in Michigan and Wisconsin. The States of Michiganand Wisconsin concurred with the regulations, although Wisconsin officialsraised concern about the possible effects of the early season on the State'sefforts to establish local breeding populations of Canada geese, especiallyat Powell Marsh. Because of this concern, during the 1987-88 hunting season,the tribes agreed to certain regulatory safeguards on the Powell Marsh,including a 3-day closure prior to the beginning of the Wisconsin gooseseason. Minnesota did not concur with the proposed regulations, and inmeetings and correspondence, stressed that the State would not recognizeChippewa Indian hunting rights in Minnesota's treaty area until a courtwith jurisdiction over the State acknowledges and defines the extent ofthese rights. The Service acknowledged the State's concern but pointedout that the United States Government has recognized the Indian huntingrights decided in the <T3>Voigt</T3> case, and that acceptable hunting regulations have beennegotiated successfully in both Michigan and Wisconsin, even though the<T3>Voigt</T3> decision did not specifically address ceded land outsideWisconsin. The Service pointed out further that this was appropriate becausethe treaties in question cover ceded lands in Michigan (and Minnesota),as well as in Wisconsin. Consequently, in view of the above, and the factthat the tribal harvest was expected to be small, the Service approvedspecial regulations for the 1987-88 hunting season on ceded lands in allthree States.On May 18, 1988, the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission againrequested special regulations, and copies of the proposal were mailed toofficials in the affected States of Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.The proposed regulations are shown below. They are similar to those establishedin previous years, except that the daily bag limit for coots in Minnesotaand Wisconsin will be 20 instead of 15, Wisconsin duck season dates alsowould apply in Minnesota, and there would be no three-day closure on PowellMarsh prior to the opening of the Wisconsin goose season.In a June 24, 1988 letter, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resourcesraised several concerns regarding the proposed regulations and asked thatthe Voigt Task Force of the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commissionand the State negotiate an agreement for the upcoming waterfowl seasonsimilar to those entered into during the previous three years. The Servicehas no objection to most of the regulations requested by the Great LakesIndian Fish and Wildlife Commission for the the upcoming hunting seasonand proposes of establish all of them, except those relating to duck huntingseason dates in Minnesota and Wisconsin. As pointed out earlier in thisdocument, the fall flight of ducks is expected to be much smaller thanusual this year, and Federal farmeworks for State hunting regulations likelywill be more restrictive than was the case in the 1987-88 season. Consequently,as a conservation measure, the Service believes that some reduction intribal hunting activity and duck harvest is needed. The Service intendsto consult with tribal and Wisconsin officials and reach a prompt and mutuallyacceptable agreement on duck hunting season dates prior to the 1988-89hunting season.The State of Michigan raised no objections to the hunting regulations requestedfor ceded lands in the State's Upper Peninsula. However, in a June 23,1988 letter from the Minnestoa Department of Natural Resources, Roger Holmes,Wildlife Section Chief, stated that the State is opposed to specail migratroybird hunting regulations for Chippewa Indians on ceded lands in Minnesota.In the letter, he acknowledged that the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe has establishedthe right to hunt on certain reservations free of State interference. However,Mr. Holmes expressed the opinion that this right does not extend to cededlands in Minnesota or to hunting migratory birds outside of the Federalframeworks. The Service notes the continued opposition of Minnesota tospecial seasons on ceded lands in the State but believes that they areappropriate if carefully regulated. Accordingly, the Service intends toconsult further with Minnesota State officials and tribal representativeswith the aim of striving for agreement on off-reservation hunting regulationsfor the 1988-89 hunting season.<ITAG tagnum="81">A.

Tribal members will comply with all basic Federal migratory bird huntingregulations, 50 CFR Part 20, and shooting hour regulations, 50 CFR Part20, Subpart K. 3. Nontoxic shot will be required for all off-reservation hunting by tribalmembers of waterfowl, coots, moorhens, and gallinules. 4. Tribal members in each zone will comply with State regulations providingfor closed and restricted waterfowl hunting areas. 5. <T3>Wisconsin Zone. </T3>Tribal members will comply with NR 10.09(1)(a)(2) and (3), Wis. Adm. Code (shotshells), sec. NR 10.12(1)(C), Wis. Adm.Code (shooting from structures), sec. NR 10.12(1)(g), Wis. Adm. Code (decoys),and sec. 29.27 Wis. Stats. (duck blinds). The Canada goose season at PowellMarsh will begin on September 19. A tribal quota of 25 Canada geese willbe in effect until September 25, or until daily censuses by Great LakesIndian Fish and Wildlife Commission or Wisconsin Department of NaturalResources employees indicate that at least 300 Canada geese are in thearea, whichever comes first. If the tribal quota is reached before September25 or before 300 Canada geese are present, Powell Marsh will be closedto tribal hunting until September 25. Thereafter, the tribal season willresume without a quota and with a daily bag limit of 3 Canada geese. <T3>6. Minnesota Zone. </T3>Tribal members will comply with M.S. 100.29,Subd. 18 (duck blinds and decoys). 7. Possession limits are applicable only to transportation and do not includebirds which are cleaned, dressed, and at a member's primary residence.For purposes of enforcing bag and possession limits, all migratory birdsin the possession or custody of tribal members on ceded lands will be consideredto have been taken on those lands unless tagged by a tribal or State conservationwarden as having been taken on-reservation. In Wisconsin, such taggingwill comply with sec. NR 19.12, Wis. Adm. Code. All migratory birds whichfall on reservation lands will not count as part of any off-reservationbag or possession limit. 8. Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, Flathead Indian Reservation,Pablo, MontanaLast year, publication of special migratory bird hunting regulations forthe Flathead Indian Reservation was delayed because of jurisdictional questionsconcerning regulation of hunting by nontribal members on reservation landsowned by non-Indians. However, the tribes and the State of Montana eventuallyreached agreement for the 1987-1988 hunting season, and the Service publishedthe regulations in the November 10, 1987 <T4>Federal Register </T4>(52 FR 43308). In a proposal received May 24, 1988, the Confederated Salish and KootenaiTribes requested special waterfowl hunting regulations for the reservationfor the 1988-89 hunting season. The proposal requested the same waterfowland coot hunting regulations that will be established for the Pacific Flywayportion of Montana and included provision for the customary early closureof the goose season on a portion of the reservation.In a June 24, 1988 letter, James W. Flynn, Director, Montana Departmentof Fish, Wildlife and Parks, stated that the Confederated Salish and KootenaiTribes and the State of Montana are working toward a long-term agreement.In his letter, Mr. Flynn stressed that there were some minor differencesto be resolved but that he is confident that they can be worked out asthey were last year so that regulations throughout the reservation areuniform and enforcement is by mutual consent. The Service is pleased that negotiations between the Confederated Salishand Kootenai Tribes and Montana are progressing satisfactorily and urgesthat agreement be reached in time to include the 1988-89 migratory birdhunting regulations for the Flathead Indian Reservation in the final rulescheduled for publication in mid-August. <ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comment Invited</ITAG>Based on the results of recently completed migratory game bird studies,and having due consideration for any data or views submitted by interestedparties, this proposed rulemaking may result in the adoption of specialhunting regulations beginning as early as September 1, 1988 on certainFederal Indian reservations, off-reservation trust lands, and ceded lands.Taking into account both reserved hunting rights and the degree to whichtribes have full wildlife management authority, the regulations for tribalor for both tribal members and nontribal members may differ from thoseestablished by States in which the reservations, off-reservation trustlands, and ceded lands are located. The regulations will specify open season,shooting hours, and bag and possession limits for rails, gallinules (includingmoorhen), woodcock, common snipe, band-tailed pigeons, mourning doves,white-winged doves, ducks (including mergansers), and geese. The Director intends that finally adopted rules be as responsive as possibleto all concerned interests. Therefore, he desires to obtain the commentsand suggestions on these proposals from the public, other concerned governmentalagencies, tribal and other Indian organizations, and private interests,and he will take into consideration the comments received. Such comments,and any additional information received, may lead the Director to adoptfinal regulations differing from these proposals. Special circumstances in the establishment of these regulations limit theamount of time that the Service can allow for public comments. Two considerationscompress the time in which this rulemaking process must operate: the need,on the one hand, for tribes and the Service to establish final regulationsbefore September 1, 1988, and on the other hand, the unavailability beforelate July of specific reliable data on this year's status of waterfowl.Therefore, the Service believes that to allow a comment period past August8, 1988 is contrary to the public interest.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comment Procedure</ITAG>It is the policy of the Department of the Interior, whenever practicable,to afford the public an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process.Accordingly, interested persons may participate by submitting written commentsto the Director, (FWS/MBMO), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Departmentof the Interior, Room 536, Matomic Building, Washington, DC 20240. Commentsreceived will be available for public inspection during normal businesshours at the Service's Office of Migratory Bird Management in Room 536,Matomic Building, 1717 H Street, NW. Washington, DC 20240. All relevantcomments on the proposals received no later than August 8, 1988 will beconsidered.<ITAG tagnum="84">NEPA Consideration</ITAG>The ``Final Environmental Statement for the Issuance of Annual RegulationsPermitting the Sport Hunting of Migratory Birds (FES-75-74)'' was filedwith the Council on Environmental Quality on June 6, 1975, and notice ofavailability was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on June 13, 1975, (40 FR 25241). A supplementto the final environmental statement ``Final Supplemental EnvironmentalImpact Statement: Issuance of Annual Regulations Permitting the Sport Huntingof Migratory Birds (SEIS 88-14)'', was filed on June 9, 1988, and noticeof availability was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on June 16, 1988 (53 FR 22582) and June 17, 1988(53 FR 22727). In addition, an August 1985 environmental assessment entitled``Guidelines for Migratory Bird Hunting Regulations on Federal Indian Reservationsand Ceded Lands'' is available from the Service.<ITAG tagnum="84">Nontoxic Shot Regulations</ITAG>On December 14, 1987 (at 53 FR 47428), the Service proposed nontoxic shotzones for the 1988-89 waterfowl hunting season. This proposed rule wassent to all affected tribes and to Indian organizations for comment. Thefinal rule on nontoxic shot zones for the 1988-89 hunting season was publishedon June 28, 1988 in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 24284). All of the proposed hunting regulationscovered by this proposed rule are in compliance with the Service's nontoxicshot restrictions.<ITAG tagnum="84">Endangered Species Act Consideration</ITAG>Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act provides that, ``The Secretaryshall review other programs administered by him and utilize such programsin furtherance of the purposes of this Act'' (and) shall insure that anyaction authorized, funded or carried out * * * is not likely to jeopardizethe continued existence of any endangered species or threatened speciesor result in the destruction or adverse modification of (critical) habitat* * *.'' Consequently, the Service has initiated section 7 consultationunder the Endangered Species Act for the proposed hunting seasons on FederalIndian reservations and ceded lands.<ITAG tagnum="85">Regulatory Flexibility Act, Executive Order 12291, and the PaperworkReduction Act</ITAG>In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>dated March 9, 1988 (53 FR 7702), the Servicereported measures it had undertaken to comply with requirements of theRegulatory Flexibility Act and the Executive Order. These included preparinga Determination of Effects and an updated Final Regulatory Impact Analysisand publication of a summary of the latter. These regulations have beendetermined to be major under Executive Order 12291, and they have a significanteconomic impact on substantial numbers of small entities under the RegulatoryFlexibility Act. This determination is detailed in the aforementioned documentswhich are available on request from the Office of Migratory Bird Management,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Room 536, Matomic Building, Washington,DC 20240. As noted in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, the Service plans to issue its Memorandum ofLaw for migratory bird hunting regulations at the same time the first ofthe annual hunting rules is completed. This rule does not contain any informationcollection requiring approval by OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3504.<ITAG tagnum="84">Authorship</ITAG>The primary author of this proposed rulemaking is Fant W.
