Police and rifle squads armed with multiple tear gas launchersfired scores of tear gas canisters at 600 demonstrating studentsand workers, who hurled firebombs and rocks in the clash outsideInchon University. Protesters burned an effigy of President RohTae-woo and called for the overthrow of the government.   ``Down with Roh Tae-woo who suppresses labor rights!''protesters yelled in the port city about 30 miles west of Seoul.   Riot police also used tear gas to disperse about 800 workers andstudents who staged scattered street protests in the Songnam areaof southern Seoul.   Protesters in Seoul took to the streets after attending thefuneral of a worker who burned himself to death April 3 in a labordispute. Workers and radical students sometimes commit ritualsuicide in South Korea as a form of protest.   Protesters and police officers were hurt in both protests, butpolice said there were no serious injuries and did not report anyarrests. The number of injured was not immediately available,police said.   Rally organizers had predicted thousands would attend the Inchonrally, but the turnout was small.   The rally came one day after 46 riot troopers were injuredstorming a food factory held by striking workers in Inchon. Thestrikers hurled diluted sulphuric acid and rocks at the police,officials said. Five workers were injured and 38 were arrested inSaturday's clash, they said.   Militant labor groups have staged strikes around the nation todemand higher wages and other concessions. The government haswarned the strikes are a serious threat to the national economy andRoh said earlier this month that labor disputes had cost more than$2 billion in lost production.   Radical students have staged violent protests in support ofstriking workers. They have little popular support and are not seenas a major threat to the government.</TEXT></DOC>
