When these porcine athletes run a 40-yard dash in the dirt of anindoor arena Saturday there will be no brand-name running shoes andno sporty uniforms, just sleek bodies, hairy legs and a team numberon each ear. The hog race is being held in conjunction with theLittle International livestock judging contest, where non-expertspractice judging livestock events.   The 18 12-week-old animals racing to bring home the bacon arepart of an experiment in assistant animal science Professor JohnMcGlone's domestic animal behavior class, where students learn howand why animals react in different situations.   And everyone has his or her own training technique.   ``I'd like to think I have the edge,'' said Eric Fugate, annative of Fairbury, Ill. He boasts about his mysterious trainingprogram, which features ``a secret recipe which is 100 percentorganic, no additives, no preservatives, no drugs.''</TEXT></DOC>
