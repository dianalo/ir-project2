The Bush administration on Wednesday informally notifiedCongress of the intended sale. That touched off a 50-day period inwhich Congress either kills the deal by majority votes in theSenate and House or lets it go through.   The key items are 315 modern tanks, but two-thirds of the pricetag _ which is equivalent to a year's U.S. aid to Israel _ is thecost of equipment and ammunition, including huge trucks totransport any tanks that break down.   Rep. Larry Smith, D-Fla., said more than two dozen members ofCongress had written to Secretary of State James A. Baker IIIrequesting ``additional consultation.''   But before notifying Congress of the plan, Baker and otheradministration officials held several sessions designed to gaugecongressional sentiment.   ``We intend to have a full hearing,'' Smith said.   Yet, the congressman added in an interview: ``I don't thinkanyone is inclined yet to file a resolution of disapproval. We wantto be sure these tanks are not used by anyone else in the region.''   Political maneuvering in recent weeks managed to diffuse theconcerns that customarily touch off strong opposition on CapitolHill to U.S. deals with Arab countries technically at war withIsrael.   The Saudis would receive the M1A2 tanks beginning in the middleof the 1990s, at about the same time the U.S. Army would fieldthem. Israel has a comparable tank, the Merkava.   To smooth congressional approval, the Bush administration agreednot to equip the Saudi tanks with plates of uranium armor, a muchdenser metal than steel.   It was not immediately clear where the tanks would be based.   If some are deployed at the Tabuk military base the tanks wouldbe only 120 miles from Israel. Others may be based near Kuwait, andstill others at an armored training school near Mecca.   In a separate deal, Israel is to receive $100 million in U.S.payments for the pre-positioning of American military equipment.The arms presumably would be used in the event of a Mideast warthat threatened U.S. security.   Next year, Saudi Arabia is expected to try to purchase Americanjet fighter planes. The purchase of U.S. tanks to replace15-year-old and largely inoperable French tanks is considered awarm-up test of congressional sentiment.   Asked why Israel's supporters had not launched a fight againstthe sale, a local military expert said the administration consultedin advance with members of Congress and ``an effort is under way toavoid a confrontation.''   ``Besides, the tanks are a ground system, having a marginaleffect on Israel's security,'' said the non-governmental expert,who spoke on condition of anonymity.   Administration officials have stressed in recent weeks the U.S.commitment to make sure Israel maintains a qualitative edge overArab armed forces.   The Saudi tanks will be equipped with special viewers for thecommanders and with night-fighting capability. Also, they will haveno electronics. ``It is the most advanced version of the tank thathas been put out to date,'' the expert said.   Last year, the Reagan administration signed a deal with Egyptfor the manufacture of 555 tanks for the Egyptian army.   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler declined todiscuss the purchase except to say Congress had been informallynotified of the administration's intention.   The purchase was designed initially as a goodwill gesture for avisit by King Fahd. But twice this summer the Saudi monarchcanceled trips to Washington with the explanation his governmentwas engaged in trying to arrange a cease-fire in Lebanon betweenwarring Christian and Moslem factions.   Congress over the years has turned back several U.S. arms salesto Arab countries out of concern for Israel's security.</TEXT></DOC>
