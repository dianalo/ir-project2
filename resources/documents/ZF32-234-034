(Sun Microsystems' SPARCstation IPC andApple's Macintosh IIfx compared for technical document publishing)(includes a related article on UNIX) (Cover Story)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Weibel, Bob.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Until recently, the only choice for creating a long or technicaldocument on a desktop system was a UNIX workstation becausemicrocomputers lacked the speed, memory and sophisticated softwarerequired.andP;  The increased power of newer microcomputers and thedeclining prices of workstations widens the choices available,however.andP;  An Apple Macintosh IIfx based on a 40-MHz Motorola 68040microprocessor and a Sun Microsystems SPARCstation IPC runningUNIX are compared processing a technical document using FrameTechnology publishing software: FrameMaker for the Mac 2.1 andFrameMaker for Sun (SunView version) 2.1, respectively.andP;  TheSPARCstation IPC ran much faster than the Macintosh IIfx in thetests, but the Macintosh was easier to use.andP;  The SPARCstation IPCis designed specifically for networking, but for the Macintoshnetworking is an afterthought.andP;  For many the choice of platformwill depend on the software selected.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   Apple Computer Inc.
