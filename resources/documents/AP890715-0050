The White House would like to have a deal to show to its partnersat the summit.   The negotiations have become a test case of the administration'snew strategy for dealing with the $1.3 trillion debt of thedeveloping nations. The new approach, representing a major shift inAmerican policy, emphasizes debt reduction or forgiveness.   Sununu, showing his thumb and index finger nearly touching, saidMexican officials and private bankers ``are now about that farapart.'' He said there was expected to be another bargaining session``in the next 24 hours or so. And it is hoped that at that meetingsubstantially most of, if not all, of that gap will be closed.''   Meanwhile, President Bush and the leaders of Britain, Canada,France, Germany, Italy and Japan opened their first full day oftalks today with an agreement to postpone new World Bank loans toChina.   The leaders noted in a statement that they already had condemned``the violent repression. ... We urge the Chinese authorities tocease action against those who have done no more than claim theirlegitimate rights to democracy and liberty.''   During the morning session, the leaders and their financeministers discussed the worrisome rise in inflation rates.   ``They all recognize that inflation is a danger, even though someare more seriously affected at the moment,'' said a Canadianofficial, demanding anonymity.   ``Inflation has to be considered as a matter of very highpriority,'' he added.   A spokesman for the European Economic Community, who demandedanonymity, said senior officials of some private banks met hereFriday afternoon with some of the indebted nations, including Mexicoand the Philippines.   ``They are very close to an agreement with Mexico but not beforethe end of the summit,'' he said. The 12-nation trading bloc, alsoknown as the Common Market, also attends the gathering.   The EEC spokesman said, ``The problem was that until about 10days ago the banks were sending extremely junior officials tonegotiate with very senior officials, sometimes ministers offinance, from the indebted countries.''   Sununu, asked about the elevation of the discussions, said, ``Itis amazing what can happen when you get the folks who can make thedecisions involved in the process.''   On Friday, French President Francois Mitterrand pressed thedemand of poorer nations for a special conference of the rich andpoor countries to discuss the plight of the Third World.   But the United States and Britain resisted that approach.   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady insisted that handling ThirdWorld problems on a case-by-case basis, the approach the richernations currently take, is better than an international conference.   Brady unveiled the new American debt approach last spring.Several other nations have approved the move, but some U.S. alliesalso expressed reservations about what they viewed as governmentbailouts.   Nigel Lawson, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, said, ``Whatis important is we have agreed (on) this extension of the debtstrategy,'' referring to the American plan.   ``And the commercial banks need to be absolutely clear there isno new initiative coming forward,'' he said. ``That is the position,and it is up to them to negotiate a debt reduction agreement withthe debtor countries, starting with Mexico.''   Brady said the United States was willing to work with the otherindustrialized nations to arrange a $1 billion to $2 billionemergency loan to help Mexico meet its obligations while itnegotiates with private bankers for a new debt accord.   Mexico, with a loan portfolio of $100 billion, is the developingworld's second largest debtor after Brazil.   Mitterrand signaled his support for urgent assistance for Mexico.   That country, he told French television, ``is on the edge of anexplosion because of the weight of its debt and the impossibility ofcarrying the burden.''   ``No one,'' he said, ``has an interest in this explosion takingplace, which would mean more misery for a suffering people.''   Mexico owes private lenders $54 billion, with about $15 billiondue American banks.   In its negotiations with bankers, Mexico wants to slash both itsoverall debt and the amount of its annual interest payments, whichrun about $10 billion a year.   The United States and Japan also took steps as the summit openedto lower trade tensions between the two countries.   The Japanese agreed to a U.S. proposal to launch negotiationsaimed at removing barriers to the sale of foreign goods. The talkswill focus on so-called structural rigidities, broad-based barrierssuch as the Japanese distribution system.   The Japanese, who had originally balked at the idea of suchtalks, agreed to a one-year deadline to come up with results.</TEXT></DOC>
