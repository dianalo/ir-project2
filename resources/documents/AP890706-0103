The report indicated the government wasintensifying its 5-week-old crackdown on dissent.   The report also stepped up criticism of ousted Communist Partyleader Zhao Ziyang and accused his aides and advisers ofcollaborating with student leaders in efforts to overthrow thegovernment.   Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong read the report June 30 to the StandingCommittee of the National People's Congress, which meets betweenannual sessions of the full congress. It was made public Thursdayafter the congress approved it.   When party officials urged Zhao to call a meeting in April todiscuss the growing student movement, Zhao ``went golfing as ifnothing had happened,'' the report said. Later he encouraged frankpress reports of the subsequent protests, it said.   ``Because he took such an attitude, the party and the governmentlost a chance to stop the turmoil,'' the report said.   Zhao was sacked after being accused of trying to split the partyand supporting the student-led demonstrators. He has been strippedof his party and government posts, but references to him in theofficial press as ``comrade'' indicate he retains his partymembership.   The government report stopped just short of accusing Zhao oftaking part in the alleged anti-government conspiracy by those underhim.   It singled out not just people who took part in the protests butintellectuals, who it said created a climate that encouraged theprotests.   Some of the intellectuals Chen named are known to have escapedChina or gone underground in the last month, while others have beenarrested. By naming individuals and describing their activities indetail, the report appeared to signal a widening purge ofintellectuals.   Although the student protests began in April, intellectuals hadbecome increasingly outspoken on political, cultural and economicissues since late last year as problems in China's 10-year-oldeconomic reform program became evident.   Thinkers and writers held forums and published unofficialmagazines to criticize government policy, and signed petitions foran amnesty for political prisoners. The report said this ``preparedfor the turmoil that ensued.''   Chen singled out more than a dozen people, including leadingdissident Fang Lizhi, who has taken refuge in the U.S. Embassy, andpolitical theorists Yan Jiaqi and Su Shaozhi, who have fled to theWest.   A publishing company official said authorities have bannedpublication of works by Fang and people accused of ``ideologicalmistakes.''   Also Thursday, the National People's Congress appointed a newambassador to the United States in a climate of worsening relationsbetween the two countries. Zhu Qizhen, who had been vice foreignminister and who speaks fluent English, was named to replace Han Xu,who held the post for four years.   State TV said Han's term was up. He was recalled to Beijing lastweek along with China's other ambassadors for what the ForeignMinistry called a regular meeting. Western diplomats said it was thefirst such general recall in decades.   Jiang Zemin, who replaced Zhao as party chief, told a visitingIndian delegation that China would not change its policies inresponse to foreign economic sanctions. It was his first meetingwith a foreign visitor since taking office June 24.   Jiang did not single out the United States, which has haltedmilitary sales and high-level contacts to protest China's June 3-4army attack on the protesters.   The congress' Standing Committee, however, passed a resolutionexpressing ``strong indignation'' over the U.S. action.   Also Thursday, the Foreign Ministry sharply rejected a U.S.Embassy protest over an army attack on foreign diplomatic housing.   The embassy had charged that the army made a premeditated attackon targeted apartments, including those of American diplomats, whenit fired on the housing complex last month. The official Xinhua NewsAgency said Vice Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu gave U.S. AmbassadorJames Lilley a note rejecting the accusation as groundless andirresponsible.   Leading newspapers joined the offensive with commentariesblasting alleged U.S. efforts to undermine socialist countries. Onecommentary by the editor of a leading party magazine, Seek Truth,said in an analysis that conflict is inevitable between thesocialist and capitalist systems.   ``We cannot ... lose our vigilance,'' Wu Jianguo wrote.   The Standing Committee approved two Cabinet changes. LaborMinister Luo Gan was replaced with a former public securityminister, Ruan Chongwu, and Chemical Industry Minister Qin Zhongdawas replaced with Gu Xiulian, who until recently was governor ofJiangsu province.   It was not clear if the changes were linked to the party'spolitical shakeup.</TEXT></DOC>
