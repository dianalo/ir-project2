(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former President Reagan, recovering fromskull surgery, should be able to return home in a few days and inthe meantime is working on paperwork and keeping up with the news, aspokesman said.   ``Physicians managing President Reagan's care are hopeful that ifthe present rate of progress continues, President Reagan will beable to return to California at the end of the week,'' Reaganspokesman Mark Weinberg said Monday.   He said no specific date has been set for Reagan, 78, to bereleased from the Mayo Clinic's St. Marys Hospital.   Mayo doctors Friday drilled a hole in the former president'sskull to remove a buildup of blood. Weinberg said the problemstemmed from a July 4 accident in which Reagan was thrown from ahorse and hit his head.   On Monday morning, Reagan read newspapers, watched morningtelevision news programs and did routine paperwork, Weinberg said.   Later, Reagan spoke with Gen. Colin Powell, chairman-designate ofthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, who had telephoned over the weekend toextend his good wishes, Weinberg said.   Reagan has spoken several times by phone with his son Ron, andhas been looking through the hundreds of cards and messages he hasreceived, Weinberg said.   An earlier blood clot was detected in Reagan's brain this summerbut it had healed on its own without an operation, Weinbergconfirmed Monday.   Neurosurgeon Thoralf M. Sundt has said that the first clot wassmaller and in a different area of the brain. Because of the firstclot, brain tests were included as part of the checkup, Sundt said.   Reagan's spokesman had not previously disclosed the earlier bloodclot, detected shortly after the horse-riding accident by doctors inLos Angeles, where Reagan lives.</TEXT></DOC>
