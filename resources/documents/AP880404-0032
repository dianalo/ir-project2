REID</NOTE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Four more soldiers jailed in plotsagainst President Corazon Aquino were missing following the weekendescape of the leader of an August coup attempt, the military saidtoday.   Chief military spokesman Col. Oscar Florendo also denied thattroops had raided a vacation home of opposition Sen. Juan PonceEnrile in connection with the nationwide search for former Lt. Col.Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan.   Honasan, 39, leader of the Aug. 28 coup attempt, and 14 guardsfled a prison ship in Manila Bay before dawn Saturday aboard tworubber dinghies. He had been confined there since his arrest Dec. 9for the attempted coup that left at least 53 people dead andhundreds wounded.   Florendo said three officers and one enlisted man jailed inconnection with the August attempt and another in January 1987 weremissing from the detention center at Villamor Air Base.   Florendo claimed, however, the four apparently fled because of``family problems'' and their escape was not related to the Honasanincident.   An earlier report by a Manila newspaper, citing an unidentifiedair force officer, put the figure at nine soldiers who had escaped.   Military officials said earlier that troops Sunday raidedEnrile's vacation house in Batangas province, southwest of Manila,as part of a search of a seaside vacation resort. But Florendodenied Enrile's house had been raided.   Enrile told a radio station today he had heard of the raid andcharged the government was acting illegally by entering homeswithout search warrants.   Honasan served as chief of security at the Ministry of NationalDefense when Enrile was defense chief. Enrile was fired in November1986, after an alleged coup attempt by his followers.   Manila newspapers have reported that leaflets were circulatingin military camps calling for the overthrow of the government. Theleaflets allegedly were from Honasan's Reform the Armed ForcesMovement, the papers said.   Florendo said a nationwide search was under way for Honasan butthat raids so far had failed because ``either we were too late orperhaps the information was not so accurate.''   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos today told reporters the militarywas investigating ``all angles'' of the incident, ``includingalleged foreign intervention in the escape of Honasan.'' Ramos didnot elaborate.   Leftist Rep. Venancio Garduce has charged that Americans mayhave helped Honasan escape to pressure the government as it beginstalks with the United States this week on the status of U.S.military bases in the Philippines.   Presidential sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidMrs. Aquino had demanded a full-scale investigation into theHonasan escape because she did not believe it was simply a resultof negligence.   The skipper of the prison ship was arrested Saturday, but thesources said Mrs. Aquino believed others in the chain of commandshould be punished.   Mrs. Aquino told a student group on Sunday that her governmentwas stable enough to withstand any new coup attempt and thatHonasan's escape ``does not in any way discourage us in what we setout to do.''   The government has survived about six major coup attempts andconspiracies since Mrs. Aquino took office on Feb. 25, 1986.   Investigators said Honasan and the others fled the prison shipaboard rubber dinghies and came ashore near the Folk Arts Center, afew hundred yards from the headquarters of the Philippine navy.They then boarded seven cars which had been waiting for them,investigators said.   Officials said Honasan left behind a note when he fled the shipsaying he was escaping because ``the struggle for a better AFP(Armed Forces of the Philippines) must go on.''   Honasan played a key role in the Feb. 22, 1986,civilian-military uprising that toppled President Ferdinand Marcosand brought Mrs. Aquino to power. But Honasan later accused Mrs.Aquino of weak and inept leadership in the face of the 19-year-oldcommunist insurgency.</TEXT></DOC>
