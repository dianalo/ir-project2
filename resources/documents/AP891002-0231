LOUIS, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   About 1,200 teachers and otherschool workers went on strike Monday, canceling classes for 15,000students in the state's fourth-largest district.   The employees, represented by the East St. Louis Federation ofTeachers, walked out after rejecting the school board's proposalfor binding arbitration to settle disputes over wage increases andinsurance payments. A federal mediator had been trying to help thesides reach an agreement.   Negotiations resumed Monday afternoon. Thirty-three schools wereclosed.   The school board has offered employees a 2 percent pay raise forthe next year, but teachers would have to pay from $22 to $34 permonth for health insurance coverage for dependents. The districtcurrently pays for dependents' health insurance.   The teachers' union is asking for a 5 percent pay raise with theschool district continuing to pay all health insurance bills .   ``The district made every reasonable effort to avoid thisinterruption of the educational process,'' school officials said ina statement. There are ``certain undeniable economic facts whichsome in the teaching ranks are apparently unwilling to accept.''   The school district is trying to lower its $12.5 million debt.   Union president Terry Turley said his members, who have beenworking without a contract since the school year began, aresensitive to the district's financial distress.   ``As a matter of fact, last year we agreed to work with a wagefreeze with the promise that this year our concerns would beaddressed in some way,'' Turley said. ``As we began the striketoday, many of those concerns have not been addressed.''</TEXT></DOC>
