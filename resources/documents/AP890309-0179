The 71-year-old Marcos, who was president of the Philippines for20 years before being ousted in 1986, has been hospitalized sinceJan. 15 with various respiratory ailments. He was listed in guardedcondition Thursday.   The Honolulu Star-Bulletin reported Thursday that one of itsreporters was allowed to see Marcos on Wednesday in his room at St.Francis Medical Center, and to interview Mrs. Marcos.   The newspaper reported that Marcos has lost so much weight thathis legs have little muscle mass and his hip bones protrude underhis sheet and blanket.   ``Do you believe his condition now?'' asked Mrs. Marcos, 59.``Can you see that the former president of the Philippines is dying,that he is not a malingerer?''   Marcos' lawyers have maintained he was too ill to fly to New Yorkfor arraignment on criminal racketeering charges accusing them ofplundering the Philippine economy and stashing much of the money inthe United States.   Mrs. Marcos pleaded innocent Oct. 31 in New York and was freed on$5 million bail provided by tobacco heiress Doris Duke.   Marcos, unable to talk because of a breathing tube in his throat,responded to his wife's greeting by turning his head slowly andstruggling to open his eyes, the newspaper said.   ``You're better today,'' Mrs. Marcos told him. ``Your fever hasdissipated. You must get better because we are going home soon and Iam not going to carry you onto that plane. You must walk.''   ``We will be at home, with peace and love and the beauty ofGod,'' she told him. ``We will enjoy the first real quiet with ourfamily in years.''   The former first lady is leading their fight to return to theirhomeland, from which they were ousted in a popular revolt.Philippine President Corazon Aquino opposes their return for anypurpose.   Mrs. Marcos said it is wrong of Mrs. Aquino to prohibit Marcos'sreturn on the basis of national security.   ``A man so sick he can hardly lift his head or open his eyes, whoneeds a tube to drink water, a tube to breathe, a tube to eat,'' isno threat, she said.   Last week, Mrs. Marcos was invited by the Nacionalista Party _the political faction to which Marcos belonged when he was firstelected president in 1965 _ to attend a reorganization meeting inManila this week.   She declined, but in a three-page letter to party chief Jose B.Laurel criticized U.S. meddling in Philippine affairs and the Aquinogovernment for exiling the couple ``to a living hell.''   ``Now please don't misconstrue this,'' she told theStar-Bulletin. ``But for me to run for the (Philippine) presidencywould be my last desperate option. My three years of painful ...experience in the United States gives me a thousand and one options,and the last desperate one would be running for the presidency.''   She blamed their legal problems for her husband's decline.   ``After I was arraigned he went downhill,'' she said. ``Can youimagine the Philippines' top trial lawyer can't be there to defendhis wife; a man who is supposed to have so much hidden wealth hecannot even bail out his wife. He is not afraid of being arraigned.It's his cup of tea, the court is his playground. He is dying togo.''   She said the world is too concerned about money.   ``Look at the songs today,'' she said. ``Madonna's `MaterialGirl' and Michael Jackson's `Bad.' All this talk about Mrs. Marcoseating in rich restaurants, going to nightclubs. What cheap thrillswe care about.''</TEXT></DOC>
