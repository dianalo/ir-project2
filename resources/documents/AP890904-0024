(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   For now, the show is over.   The suspension of Jim Bakker's fraud and conspiracy trial lastweek also halted a sideshow by impersonators and vendors hoping tomake a few bucks off the misfortunes of the fallen PTL leader andhis wife, Tammy Faye.   Throngs of curiosity-seekers dispersed after Bakker suffered abreakdown and was sent away Thursday for psychiatric tests at thefederal prison hospital in Butner.   Dr. Sally Johnson, who also evaluated presidential assailant JohnHinckley Jr., is leading a team conducting tests to determineBakker's competency to stand trial, said Bryan Bledsoe, executiveassistant to the warden.   An hour before Bakker's U.S. District Court trial started a weekago today, a chauffeur-driven Cadillac marked ``Jim and Tammy PTLLimousine'' pulled up to the courthouse. The chauffeur hopped outand opened the car's door to let out two people who appeared from adistance to be Jim and Tammy Bakker.   Jeff and Lucille Thompson of Charlotte were wearing rubberJim andTammy masks and expensive-looking clothes and jewelry. A minutelater, the impersonators climbed back into their limousine and left.   Then there was Lida Lee Pink and her cousin Paul, who said theydrove from Topsy, Tenn., to peddle homemade Bible Belts _ tiny blackbooklets that contained a few Bible verses and were attached byVelcro to belts made of black seat-belt webbing. The belts wereoffered for $22.39, including tax, postage and handling. However,Ms. Pink said no one was buying them.   Larry Starnes and Jerry Lowrance of Gastonia hawked recordings oftheir PTL Song from underneath a beach umbrella. Lowrance said heproduced the country-tacky parody in 1986.   For nearly two days until they were persuaded to stop, theyplayed the song from a portable tape recorder over and over: ``Toavoid that trip to Hell, join the P-T-L.''   Judge Robert Potter had ordered marshals to keep the spectatorsideshow off the courthouse's spacious grounds, so the commotion waslimited to sidewalks and did not filter into the courtroom.   Bakker, 49, is accused of using nearly $4 million in ministryfunds to finance a lavish lifestyle. If convicted, he could besentenced to 120 years in prison and fined more than $5 million.   He was committed to Butner after psychiatrist Dr. Basil Jacksontestified Bakker was hallucinating and hiding his head under a couchin his attorney's office.   Potter suspended the trial at least until Wednesday, telling thejury nothing about Bakker's condition.</TEXT></DOC>
