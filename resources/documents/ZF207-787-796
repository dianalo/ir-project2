 It is in effect an extra layer on top of the MS-DOS[R]operating system, enhancing and extending the services provided by MS-DOS (1)and Windows (2).andP;  There are five areas in which NewWave surpasses Windows:control, communication, integration, abstraction, and ease of use.andP;  BecauseNewWave controls programs and provides new methods of communication betweenthem, users can integrate several programs to do one task easily.andO;Furthermore, NewWave enables the users to deal with the computer at a higherlevel of abstraction.andP;  That is, users can use simpler techniques to dobroader, more complicated tasks--similar to the way programmers can do muchmore with one line of code in a high-level language than with one line ofAssembler.andP;  Finally, NewWave is easy to use.andP;  Its advanced help andComputer-Based Training (CBT) systems make it simple for users to learn howto avail themselves of its services.andM;At the implementation level, NewWave is built upon multiple Windows programsand dynamic-link libraries (DLLs), as well as its data files.andP;  Windowsdevelopers can access these features by making calls to the NewWavefunctional interface and conforming to its interapplication communicationprotocols.andM;Using NewWaveandM;Although under the surface NewWave is constructed from normal Windowsprograms, the user interacts with the program in quite a different way.andO;Instead of beginning work in the MS-DOS Executive with its familiar directorylisting, the first thing a NewWave user sees is the NewWave Office window,shown in Figure 1.andP;  Users can also access a conventional text listing of theicons, illustrated in Figure 2.andM;The Office can be resized like any other Windows program, but it usuallycovers the entire screen.andP;  On its surface is a set of icons representingfamiliar office tools such as the Printer, the Waste Basket, and the FileDrawer; data objects such as the file folders, simple text documents andimages; and compound documents built from smaller objects of text, graphs,and images.andP;  While the screen will show only one copy of a tool at a time, itcan show multiple instances of data objects.andM;To work with a particular data object, just double click on its icon.andO;NewWave has a record of which tool (EXE file) was used to create thatobject's data file.andP;  The appropriate program is automatically started and thedata is read into it.andP;  Thus, the user is raised above the details of the filesystem.andP;  NewWave also has a one-step drag-and-drop technique used foroperations like copying, deleting, and printing objects.andP;  For example, todelete a data object or folder of objects, the user just clicks on theobject, drags the mouse to the Waste Basket icon, and drops it in.andM;FeaturesandM;One of the principal benefits of NewWave is its superior ability to deal withcompound documents.andP;  To get a better feel for NewWave's features, we willlook at a simple demonstration system, consisting of a compound monthlyreport document that contains a nested bitmapped image and a nestedspreadsheet.andP;  Figure 3 shows the structure of this document.andM;Compound documents are data objects built from a tree of other nested dataobjects.andP;  The component objects can be pieces of text, graphs, spreadsheets,Tagged Imaged File Format (TIFF) images, or even captured voice recordings oranimation sequences.andP;  In the example, the pieces are incorporated into acompound object and manipulated by a prototype NewWave-capable word processorcalled NewWave Write.andM;There are several methods that can be used to combine the nested objects intoa larger compound document.andP;  The simplest is to drag the icon of the nestedobject (the source object) and drop it into the larger destination documentat the point where it is to appear.andP;  This method moves the documentcompletely inside the destination, so the separate source icon will no longerbe shown in the Office window.andP;  Figure 4 shows the sample object on thescreen after it has been constructed.andM;But what if you also want to show the source object, say the spreadsheet, inanother compound document at the same time?andP;  In that case, you cansimultaneously share the single source with multiple destination objects.andP;  Todo this, highlight the source icon with a mouse click, then select Share fromthe Edit menu.andP;  A reference to the source object is now on the clipboard.andO;Now you can go into one or more destination documents and use the clipboard'sfamiliar Paste command to insert a nested view of the source document.andP;  Afterthe pasting, the separate icon for the source will still appear in theNewWave Office window.andM;The full powerr of NewWave is demonstrated when you need to modify thecompound document or one of its components.andP;  For example, suppose you decideto add another column to the nested spreadsheet.andP;  To access the spreadsheet,simply double click on the area where it is nested.andP;  Since the NewWavedatabase of links or views knows which tool and data files were used tocreate the nested spreadsheet, it can automatically start the toolapplication and load the spreadsheet for modification.andP;  So you can see whatis happening, NewWave explodes the nested window and grays the area where itis normally nested.andP;  The exploded window will be the main window of theapplication that was used to create the source object.andP;  In our spreadsheetexample, the application might be Microsoft Excel.andP;  Figure 5 shows the nestedTIFF picture being modified.andM;When a conventional program needs to support a new data type, new code tohandle that type must be added to the application.andP;  Another feature ofNewWave is that it eliminates this duplication of code by logically joiningall application data files to the programs that created and edited them.andO;When it is time to view or manipulate the source data, the destination objectcan simply ask the source object to do it.andP;  This is the principal sense inwhich NewWave is object-oriented.andP;  In fact, a NewWave object is defined asthis paired combination of data and the application required to manipulateit.andP;  NewWave is also object-oriented in that objects pass command messagesback and forth to each other.andP;  The standard term &quot;method&quot; is used to describethe code used by an object to process one of its messages.andM;What if you start modifying the visually linked image separately while thelarger compound document is closed?andP;  NewWave's database of interobjectlinks--part of the Object Management Facility (OMF) discussed below--takescare of this also.andP;  When the larger report is later opened or printed, itwill see a flag in the database telling it that the graph has changed.andP;  Thereport object can then ask the graph to rerender the projected view ofitself.andM;NewWave allows you to paste the report into an even larger compound document.andO;Nested groups of compound objects can be moved, copied, printed, erased, ormailed all at once, simply by selecting the overall object with the mouse anddragging it to the destination or by copying and pasting it through theclipboard.andM;Advanced FeaturesandM;Now we will extend the sample program to include advanced NewWave features.andO;In its present form the sample monthly report only uses NewWave's visuallinks (also called visual views).andP;  That is, the source objects are onlyconnected to the larger destination visually; there is no actual passing ofdata between the applications.andP;  To pass binary data, such as an array ofintegers from a spreadsheet, NewWave uses its second main type of link, thedata passing link.andM;Figure 6 shows how data passing links can be added to the sample program.andP;  Weadded two new hypothetical applications, a NewWave-capable terminal programand a NewWave-capable graphing program.andP;  A NewWave Agent task script, whichis like an advanced batch file or macro for Windows programs, has also beenadded.andP;  The script is used to make all the applications work as a team toproduce the monthly report.andM;To produce the report, the controlling Agent script first sends theappropriate commands to the NewWave-capable terminal, causing it to dial allof the company's regional offices.andP;  The Agent script automatically collectsthe monthly sales data from each office.andP;  Details of the quantities ofproducts sold are passed via a NewWave data passing link to the spreadsheet.andO;As in the first part of the example, the spreadsheet uses a visual link toproject the spreadsheet grid into the report, but now it also uses a datapassing link to pass the summarized spreadsheet data to a NewWave-capablegraphing program.andP;  The graphing program then uses a visual link to displayitself inside the report.andM;The abstraction of file folder icons to represent directories and the filesthey contain is another advanced feature of NewWave.andP;  To illustrate thisfeatures, the sample also includes the monthly report in a folder of allmonthly reports for the year.andP;  The folders can be nested inside each other aswell as inside the File Drawer icon.andP;  Folders are opened with a simple doubleclick.andP;  Figure 7 shows the open File Drawer; the Budgets folder within hasalso been opened.andM;The connection between filed objects is accomplished with NewWave's thirdtype of link, the simple link.andP;  Instead of passing views or data these linkssimply enclose one object inside a parent container object.andP;  Other objectscan also be inserted into or removed from a container object, such as theWaste Basket, with the drag-and-drop method.andM;OMF and APIandM;SystemsandM;Now that you are familiar with the features of NewWave, we will describe itsmajor components (some of which were referred to earlier).andP;  NewWave consistsof two main systems, the OMF and the API (see Figure 8).andP;  The API in turn iscomposed of three smaller systems: the Agent task script system, the Helpsystem, and the CBT.andP;  The OMF is used to record and supervise the visual anddata links between objects.andP;  The API Agent script system handles therecording, playback, and editing of the task scripts used to control NewWaveapplications.andP;  The API, Help, and CBT systems provide a high-quality,pre-written, standard foundation for adding help, demos, and training toNewWave applications.andM;All the objects in a NewWave system are connected in a tree.andP;  Near the top ofthe tree is the NewWave Office.andP;  It is a parent to every object that appearsin the Office window.andP;  For example, the File Drawer is a child of the NewWaveOffice, and it in turn has its own children in the form of folders.andP;  Figure 9shows one of the diagnostic utilities that comes with the system; thisutility allows you to traverse the object tree.andP;  A child object is enclosedin a container or acts as the source in a visual or data link.andP;  One child canhave multiple parents (a graph object, for example, can have visual viewsprojected into three parent reports at the same time), which makes thestructure more than a simple tree.andM;ProcessorsandM;Every NewWave application contains two systems, the Action processor and theCommand processor, as shown in Figure 10.andP;  The Action processor translatesuser actions, such as mouse clicks and menu selections, into one of thecommands that the NewWave application can perform.andP;  Often, several differentactions will be translated into the same command.andP;  For example, using anaccelerator key sequence nsuch as Alt-F-x) can execute the same command asselecting a menu item with the mouse (such as clicking on File, then Exit).andM;The Command processor provides all the actual functionality of theapplication.andP;  It executes commands that are passed to it from severalpossible sources.andP;  For example, commands can come directly from the Actionprocessor as a result of current user keystrokes and mouse movements or beplayed back from an Agent script.andP;  The Command processor must be able tohandle the full range of verbs in the application's command language.andP;  Agentscripts are built from this set of commands.andP;  This is discussed in detailbelow.andM;Splitting the application's control system into Action and Command processorsmakes it much easier for NewWave to implement the Agent macro facility.andP;  Thatis, when NewWave records an Agent script, it need not concern itself with thedetails of the user's actions.andP;  It only has to store the series of commandsthat result from the Action processor's translation.andM;At a lower level, the Action and Command processors are supported by severalother processors and components.andP;  Figure 11 shows the system in detail.andP;  Thisdesign enables the application to run in one of five modes: Playback, Record,Intercept (for Help), Monitor (for CBT), or Error mode.andP;  In Playback mode, anAgent task script sends commands to the application through the API.andP;  InRecord mode, the user's actions are translated into commands and stored in anAgent task script.andP;  Intercept mode is entered when the user asks forcontext-sensitive help.andP;  The cursor changes to a question mark, and the userclicks on the item of interest.andP;  In Monitor mode, all commands are passed tothe CBT system before they are executed.andP;  This allows the CBT system todiscard inappropriate commands during a lesson and guide the user in theright direction.andP;  During Error mode, any error notifications are rerouted tothe controlling Agent instead of to the normal destination, which is an errormessage box for the user.andM;Although the system is complex, the hard part of initial design and debugginghas been done for you.andP;  The NewWave Software Development Kit (SDK) givesdetailed examples of how to build the pieces.andP;  The components (as opposed toprocessors) are supplied by Hewlett-Packard.andP;  The user need only change thevariable names in these components to match his or her system.andP;  As shown inthe figure, any modeless dialog boxes need to be supported with their ownAction processor.andM;The Translate to Internal and Translate to External processors convertcommands between Internal and External format.andP;  Commands are stored inExternal binary form by Agent tasks.andP;  This is the form passed to theapplication for execution.andP;  The application translates this to its ownprivate Internal format, which can take whatever form is necessary.andM;Compared to WindowsandM;NewWave has several advantages over Windows.andP;  One is the superiority of theforms of links NewWave has to the methods of interprocess communication inWindows.andP;  In Windows there are no standard equivalents of the visual viewsand simple container links found in NewWave.andP;  Nor are there Windowsequivalents to the share capability or ability to move, print, copy, andpaste compound documents NewWave possesses.andP;  These features make itsignificantly easier to organize and maintain complex objects in NewWave thanin Windows.andP;  The Windows Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) protocol does, however,provide some of the same features as the NewWave data passing links.andP;  DDEmoves data between two applications via messages and shared memory blocks.andO;Both DDE and NewWave data passing links allow one application to update alinked program automatically without requiring the user to take any action.andO;For example, one conventional Windows program can read stock price data fromDow Jones and pass the latest prices via DDE to a graphing program forreal-time display.andM;The primary advantage that NewWave data passing links have over DDE is thatthey provide several fairly complex services that DDE users would have torewrite and debug from scratch.andP;  Not only would a DDE application needconsiderable added code, that code would have to be duplicated the same wayin all the other programs with which the DDE application was going tocommunicate.andP;  NewWave moves much of that common code out of individualapplications and into one centralized, standardized, operating-system-styleservice.andM;Another way in which the NewWave link services go beyond DDE is that they arepersistent.andP;  When you shut down two programs using DDE, the link will bebroken.andP;  Under NewWave, a systemwide database in the OMF records a list ofthe links among all applications.andP;  As soon as a link is created, it isrecorded in the database.andP;  When the NewWave programs are closed, the linkpersists and will resume operation when the programs are restarted.andP;  (DDEapplications, on the other hand, would have to reestablish the link eachtime.)andM;For example, suppose you have linked some numbers from a spreadsheet to areport you are producing with an editor.andP;  The editor doesn't have to be onconstantly, waiting to get possible changes from the spreadsheet.andP;  If thespreadsheet does change, NewWave will automatically set a flag in its linkdatabase, indicating that the report needs to be updated when it is reopened.andO;When the editor starts again, NewWave can automatically restart thespreadsheet in the background to rerender the linked data.andM;If the editor were using conventional DDE, it would have to implement its ownlist of the server applications to which it was linked as well as the type ofdata passed over each of the links.andP;  NewWave removes this burden fromindividual applications by providing it as an environmental service.andM;Another interprocess communication service unique to NewWave is the snapshot.andO;A snapshot is a special type of object used to reduce the time and memoryoverhead required for communication views between two objects.andP;  Usually whena destination object requests the rendering of a fresh view or more data froma source object, the entire source object must be loaded and run.andP;  This couldmean loading an entire spreadsheet application and a large worksheet just toaccess three numbers somewhere in the worksheet.andP;  NewWave enables you toprovide a small snapshot object that can render only a particular linkedview.andP;  If a snapshot is present when a destination object requests thererendering of a view, NewWave will reroute the request, instead of the fullapplication, to the destination object.andM;A snapshot is implemented as a small DLL with an associated data file.andP;  Itloads faster and requires less memory because it is a DLL and not a fullprocess.andP;  A snapshot doesn't have to contain the user interface or any othercode beyond what is required to render that one view.andP;  Conventional DDE, onthe other hand, would require both complete applications to be present inmemory in order to pass the new data.andM;Another way in which NewWave extends Windows is in its task script language,called Agents.andP;  Agents are comparable to extended BAT files that controlWindows programs.andP;  Windows Version 2.1 currently has no built-in controlscript facility of this kind.andP;  Although under Windows it is possible to writejournaling programs that record and play back series of keystrokes and mousemovements, the NewWave Agents function at a cleaner and more fundamentallevel.andP;  Unlike journaled keystrokes and mouse movements (which are justrecorded user actions rather than commands), Agents will work regardless ofhow many applications are present in the Office and where they arepositioned.andM;The task language has many standard statements, including opening, closing,minimizing, and maximizing applications, that correspond to commands sharedby most NewWave programs.andP;  The most interesting feature of the Agentlanguage, however, is its extensibility to support individual applications.andO;Each NewWave program defines its own command language and implements a parserto translate it.andP;  A full NewWave application must define statements in itscommand language to support all its menu items and their parameters.andP;  Thegoal is for the Agent to be able to do anything the user can do directly.andO;See the sidebar &quot;NewWave Command and Function Summary,&quot; which has somecommands from the Agent task language.andM;An Agent can control individual applications by communicating with themdirectly in their own language of commands.andP;  As a result, NewWaveapplications no longer need the extra code necessary to support their ownnonstandard internal macro languages.andP;  Users can control all their NewWaveapplications with a single task language.andM;Agent scripts can be generated by capturing a series of user commands (seeFigures 12 and 13) or by creating them directly with an ordinary text editor.andO;The language supports control structures such as loops, branching, andprocedures; it also supports integer, float, and string variables.andP;  Forperformance, the scripts are compiled into a binary form before being run.andM;In the future, a built-in scheduling system will allow Agents to performtasks at specified times, such as a single time or regularly every day orweek (see Figure 14).andP;  An Agent could be told to wait for a trigger eventbefore it starts running.andP;  For example, the receipt of a piece of E-mailcould trigger the data being placed into a report.andM;Figure 15 shows a simple Agent task script.andP;  Note that because this articlewas written before the release version of NewWave was ready, the PASTE andCLOSE commands had to be used in intermediate pcode form.andM;NewWave also adds to Windows with its user support.andP;  NewWave includesprewritten CBT, Help, and Native Language Support (NLS) systems.andP;  NewWave isin a unique position to offer first-rate Help and CBT services because of thesimilarity of its Help, CBT, and Agent macro facilities.andP;  All three systemsare concerned with monitoring and controlling the execution of individualapplications.andP;  In fact, the CBT lessons are written in an extended form ofthe Agent macro language.andP;  As you have seen, all user actions must passthrough a NewWave application's Action Processor before being translated intocommands that are executed by its Command Processor.andP;  The CBT system canwatch and modify this traffic of commands to control the user's interactionwith the system.andP;  The CBT can, for example, intercept, recognize, and pointout correct and incorrect user responses during a lesson.andP;  NewWave providestools for creating CBT and Help documents.andP;  Its built-in CBT animationdevelopment system, shown in Figure 16, helps developers design documentationand Help files at the same time they are writing the program.andM;Conventional CBT systems often attempt to simulate the behavior of specificparts of the applicaction.andP;  Rather than adding new simulation code, NewWAveCBT simply uses the application itself by sending its commands directly tothe Command Processor.andM;Converting ApplicationsandM;NewWave has built-in support to help convert an application to otherlanguages and customs.andP;  First, a single generic version of the program iswritten.andP;  Later, nontechnical translation workers can use the tools NewWaveprovides to adapt the local character handling (see Figure 17) and customssupport without changing any code.andM;In order to see how NewWave capabilities can be added to an existing Windowsapplication, we will look at portions of the code for a Shapes program thatcomes with the Windows SDK.andP;  The NewWave version is called HPShape.andP;  Shapesdoes only one thing: it draws one of four geometric figures selected from itsmenu--a triangle, an ellipse, a rectangle, or a star.andP;  HPShape has been madeinto a typical source object that projects its visual view into a destinationobject.andM;The NewWave SDK includes a second program called HPLayout as a sampledestination object.andP;  To nest a visual view of HPShape in HPLayout, mark offan area inside the HPLayout window with the mouse.andP;  The nested area is shownin reverse (white foreground on a black background).andP;  To project the HPShapeview into this small area, drag HPShape's icon over it and drop it in.andP;  Ifyou want to manipulate the nested HPShape object, double click on the nestedarea to bring up HPShape's main window.andP;  Figure 18 shows the compounddocument, SDK NW Layout Demo, with its two nested children open.andP;  The areaswhere they normally appear in the document are gray.andP;  The object calledNestable HP Text is another simple source object that comes with the NewWaveSDK.andP;  It projects a visual view of text.andM;Getting NewWave's additional functionality comes at the price of a fairamount of extra code.andP;  Whereas the simple Shapes WinApp weighs in with only7Kb of C source code, the HPShape and HPLayout applications require 55Kb and157Kb of C source code, respectively.andP;  Ofg course, that added code gives youa help system, a programming language, and data and visual linkingcapability.andP;  The amount of added NewWAve code is also relatively fixed insize.andP;  For a normal sized program it will be a smaller percentage of thetotal code.andM;Figures 19 and 20 are calltrees for the programs produced with MicrosoftCALLTREE.EXE utility.andP;  Calltree listings show the hierarchy of function callsfor a C program.andP;  The calls made from a function are indented beneath it.andO;Figure 19 shows the structure of the pre-NewWave Shapes; Figure 20 shows theHPShape NewWave program.andP;  The full source code for three HPShape functions(ShapeWndProc, ActionProcessor, and CommandProcessor) is shown in Figures 21,22, and 23.andM;The data file referred to in the figures is used to record to in the shapethat was being displayed in the HPShape window.andP;  This means that even afterthe NewWave application is closed, its state persists and when it is reopenedthis state is restored.andM;As with all Windows and Presentation Manager programs, a NewWave program isessentially a large message processor.andP;  The program spends its liferesponding to the spectrum of messages that enter its main window procedure.andO;It separates the messages into general categories and passes them to morespecialized handlers.andP;  Figure 24 contains the messages recognized by thepre-NewWave Shapes; Figure 25 contains the considerably broader list to whichHPShape must respond.andM;ConventionalandM;ApplicationsandM;In order for applications to exploit NewWave fully, they must be specificallywritten to interact with its new interfaces.andP;  But while these fullyNewWave-capable applications are being written it is important for NewWave tobe able to interact with any conventional MS-DOS and Windows programs such asLotus [R] 1-2-3 [R].andP;  NewWave provides several methods for encapsulatingthese existing applications to make them more functional in NewWave.andM;At its lowest level, NewWave allows existing programs to be run from a menu.andO;This requires no encapsulation at all.andP;  Windows applications as well ascharacter mode or graphic MS-DOS programs that take over the whole screen canbe run this way.andP;  The user can context switch between the program and therest of NewWave and use the clipboard to cut and paste between it and otherapplications.andP;  Integrating a new program to operate at this level takes onlya few minutes.andM;Moving up the integration scale requires the encapsulation of the existingprogram into a shell created by an interactive installation tool provided byNewWave.andP;  The lowest level of encapsulation takes about an hour.andP;  It allowsdata files created by the program to be represented as an icon in the NewWaveOffice.andP;  These objects can be manipulated in most of the same ways that afull NewWave application can.andP;  They can be opened with a double click ormoved, copied, filed, mailed, or discarded with the drag-and drop technique.andO;The disadvantages are that they allow neither data nor visual links to otherobjects nor can they use the full Agents task language, help, or trainingsystems.andM;The highest level of encapsulation requires considerable programming, butdoing that programming is significantly easier than completely rewriting theapplication as a native NewWave application.andP;  The new code primarily addssupport for data and visual links.andP;  It consists of a browser program thatunderstands the format of the application's data dna can talk to the NewWaveOMF.andP;  For example, when a destination object sends a message asking anencapsulated source object to display a view of itself in a given rectangle,the browser reads the object's data file and displays the data to the screen.andO;If it is necessary to edit the data, the browser can invoke the necessaryapplication to do so.andM;A full NewWave application goes further by providing complete support for theAgent task language, context-sensitive help, NewWave user interface, andComputer-Based Training.andM;Machine RequirementsandM;The minimum hardware that HP recommends for NewWave users is a 286 PC/AT [R]or 100 percent compatible, 3Mb of LIM 4.0 EMS memory, a 20Mb hard disk, andan EGA display (a VGA is significantly better).andP;  Developers should increasethis to 4Mb of EMS memory.andP;  A 40Mb or larger hard disk is recommended.andO;Developers will also need Microsoft Windows/286 [TM] Version 2.11, andMicrosoft C 5.1 or higher.andP;  As with most Windows or Presentation Managerwork, a fast 386 machine significantly increases productivity.andM;NewWAve enhancements to Windows programs come at the cost of increased code,although that cost can be lessened by choosing the level of encapsulationyour program requires.andP;  Windows programmers who are interested in extendingand enhancing their Windows programs must give serious consideration toprogramming for the NewWave environment.andM;(1) For ease of reading, &quot;MS-DOS&quot;
