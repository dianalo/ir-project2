They are: ARCOSolar Inc. - research for $925,000 to develop thin film photovoltaicmodules that capture the sun's rays and convert them into electricity;Alternative Energy Institute - research for $135,000 to collect and concentratesunlight via a series of tracking parabolic dishes (heliostats), andtransfer collected light into the interior of a commercial building;Solar Turbines Inc. - research for $52,500 to test a liquid fuel injectionsystem that results in a reduction of oxides of nitrogen in cogenerationgas turbines; Pacific Gas and Electric Company - research for $500,000to establish a program for field testing and evaluating emerging newphotovoltaic technologies; San Diego Gas and Electric Company - researchcontract to test and evaluate the largest geothermal power plant in theworld using an organic rankine cycle steam turbine, which uses a fluidwith a lower-than-normal boiling point, thereby potentially generatingelectricity with lower temperature heat; and Fayette Manufacturing Corporation- loan contract for $1,250,000 to demonstrate the technical and economicfeasibility of a new heat cycle process called the Kalina Cycle. TheCEC will soon be releasing a Request for Proposals (RFP) for both privateand public organizations for the second-round ETAP solicitation.</TEXT></DOC>
