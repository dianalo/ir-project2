Healthy, nonsmoking volunteers, 18 to 35 years old,who were seronegative to influenza A/Korea/82 (H{sub 3}N{sub 2}) virus,breathed either filtered air or NO{sub 2} for two hours a day for threeconsecutive days. Live, attenuated cold-adapted influenza A/Korea/82reassortant virus was administered intranasally to all subjects afterthe second day of exposure. No adverse changes in pulmonary functionor nonspecific airway reaction to methacholine were observed after NO{sub2} exposure, virus infection, or both. Although the differences werenot statistically significant, the groups exposed to NO{sub 2} in year3 became infected more often (91%) than those exposed only to air (71%).</TEXT></DOC>
