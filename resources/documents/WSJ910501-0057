What haspropelled its shares to $16.625 from a year-end level of$6.25 is a three-letter word that inspires passion in thehearts of stock traders: oil.   The tiny, Dallas-based exploration company says it is onto a big-time discovery in the foothills of the AndesMountains in Colombia.</LP><TEXT>   Never mind that no one knows how much oil is there. Whenfacts are scarce, dreams run wild. Analysts touting Tritonare salivating over speculation that the oil field may holdone billion barrels and possibly two billion. Either casewould put it in the league of the &quot;elephants,&quot; the huge oildiscoveries that are as lucrative as they are rare.   Bruce Lazier, an analyst with San Jacinto Securities inDallas, calls it &quot;prospectively a multibillion-barreldiscovery.&quot; Egging the Street on is Mike McInerney, Triton'svice president of corporate development and investorrelations, who says &quot;it looks like we have ourselves a verysubstantial-sized reserve.&quot;   British Petroleum, Triton's partner and the operator inthe area known as the Llanos Basin, found oil there in 1988.It is drilling two appraisal wells to get a handle on howmuch is present.   BP has a 38% share of the prospect and Total C.F.P. ofFrance also has 38%. Triton has a smaller 24%. But with only54 million barrels of proven oil reserves it would be thepartner most affected by a big discovery.   Although BP won't comment on the discovery's possiblesize, last week, citing the &quot;high-profile&quot; nature of thearea, BP took the unusual step of confirming that oil ornatural gas, possibly both, had been found in an appraisalwell still being drilled. A BP spokesman added, however,&quot;Don't read anything into it.&quot; Analysts read this as a signthat BP would like its partner to stop gabbing.   After all, serious questions remain. It's unknown how muchof the reserve is oil and how much is less-valuable naturalgas. The terrain is hard, making exploration costly.Producers elsewhere in Colombia have been badly hurt byterrorists.   Analysts say any oil found would have a net present valueof $2 to $3 a barrel. After royalties and the transfer of arequired share to Colombia's state oil company, Triton'seffective share would be 9.6% of that. Thus, a billion-barreldiscovery might boost Triton's value by some $11 a share. Asmaller find of, say, 300 million barrels might be valued atonly $3 a share.   Oil stocks rarely trade at full asset value. And atTriton's share price, Salomon Brothers' Thomas Driscoll sayshalf of the value of a billion-barrel find is reflected inTriton's stock. Suppose the field holds less than that?Salomon has yanked its buy recommendation. &quot;You're gamblingon whether the well is going to hit,&quot; Mr. Driscoll says. EvenFrank Bracken, a Howard Weil analyst who is among Triton'sbiggest fans, says there is too much success &quot;built into thestock&quot; for him to continue recommending it. &quot;We want to see aproduction test,&quot; he says.   Answers will come this summer, when BP tests the flow rateof its second well. Meanwhile, data about the drilling seemsto be leaking out to analysts. Based on oil &quot;shows,&quot; rocksamples and talk of multiple &quot;pay zones,&quot; or oil-bearinglayers, Triton is &quot;euphoric,&quot; says David Snow, an energyanalyst in New Jersey. He says a natural layer of condensatesitting above the oil will act like the fizz in a soda bottleand &quot;drive the oil out.&quot; He adds: &quot;Of course, we don't knowthat. I'm giving it 80% odds.&quot;   Triton has a history of promoting oil plays which,although still being pursued, have yet to work out asexpected, analysts say. Spreading itself thin, the companygot into some financial problems last year. Divestituresnetted $166 million and restored the balance sheet but didn'teradicate concern over Triton's penchant for publicity. &quot;Theyhave promoted oil fields in Gabon, Australia, Argentina,&quot;says one skeptical analyst. &quot;Billion-barrel fields don't comearound that often.&quot;   Mr. McInerney denies Triton is overly promotional, saying,&quot;Sure we're excited. If you couldn't get excited about theprospects for success, you'd be in the wrong business.&quot;   Mr. Lazier says that if the Street's mistrust has helddown the shares, so much the better for investors now. Hemaintains that even without the Llanos Basin Triton hasenough cash flow to support its stock price, or nearly so,though it isn't likely to earn much at current oil and gasprices.   &quot;Wall Street is full of number crunchers who look at lastyear's reserves&quot; and forget that the oil business is chieflyabout finding oil, he says. &quot;This is the best explorationstock in 10 years.&quot; Perhaps. Or it could prove the wisdom inthe old Wall Street maxim: Buy on the rumor, sell on thenews.   ---   Triton Energy   (NYSE; Sumbol: OIL)                                                                                                          Business: Oil and gas exploration                                                                                                          Nine months end Feb. 28, 1991:   Revenue: $234 million   Net income: $2.4 million*;                                                                                                          Third quarter, Feb. 28, 1991:   Net income: 5 cents a share vs. net loss:   50 cents a share                                                                                                          Average daily trading volume:   196,566 shares                                                                                                          Common shares outstanding: 20.4 million                                                                                                          *Includes $2.3 million extraordinary credit as tax benefitfrom tax-loss carry-forwards.
