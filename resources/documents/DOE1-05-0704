Constitution:Radioactive material-retaining layers are disposed in the annular gapformed between the outer wall of a reactor container and the inner wallof concretes of reactor buildings. In the thus constituted nuclear reactorbuildings, if large rupture accidents should occur in recycling lines,which are followed by reactor core meltdown accidents due to the failureof normal operation of safety systems, thus leading to the destructionof the reactor container, fiberous glass wools in the radioactive material-retaininglayers disposed in the annular gap retain the radioactive materials togreatly reduce the amount of materials released to the circumstances.The materials used for the radioactive material-retaining layers arenot restricted only to the fiberous glass wools and any other materialscan be used so long as they are highly retaining material (such as sand,chacoal, etc.).
