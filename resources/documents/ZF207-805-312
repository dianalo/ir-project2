(letter to the editor)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Jensen, Craig; Kubilus, Norbert, J.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>LettersandM;WISHFUL THINKINGandM;The editorial &quot;Enter the Storage Czar&quot; (Sept.andP;  25, page 32) assumes thatIBM's planning and wishful thinking will in fact occur within existingproduct lifetimes.andP;  It seems to me that the operative words in the editorialwere that IBM &quot;began moving toward&quot; a nifty storage management system when itintroduced the MVS/ESA operating system last year.andM;My view is that, although IBM can be made to look very good in terms of rawMIPS or in isolated examples, when it comes to getting useful, productivework done, nothing tops VAX/VMS.andP;  Until recently, IBM mainframes couldn'teven connect to their own IBM PCs without going through a VAX!andM;Obviously, DEC is aware of storage management issues and the fragmentationproblem in particular.andP;  The company has stated publicly that it is workingtoward a solution.andP;  The key difference here is that IBM is predicting that itwill somehow, someday, have a dream solution, while DEC is actively doingsomething about the problem right now.andM;Of course, with giant public companies, solutions take awhile.andP;  And that'swhy smaller, nimbler, third-party vendors such as Executive Software cansurvive and do so well.andP;  We can deliver real solutions while DEC is workingon the next decade's architecture and hardware, assessing problems within theframework of the future as well as the present.andM;Our view is that third-party vendors will always be ahead of DEC in thestorage management and system management software areas because we canrespond to market needs quickly and devote resources to problems that existright now, while an $11 billion giant addresses a longer time span and agreater variety of variables.andP;  DEC's Cooperative Marketing Program andIndependent Software Vendor Program are aimed at utilizing these strengths inthe third-party arena.andP;  Craig Jensen Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerExecutive Software Glendale, Calif.andM;NOT THE FIRST MAINFRAMEandM;Contrary to your article &quot;DEC Set To Unveil First Mainframe, VAX 9000, Oct.andO;24&quot; (Sept.andP;  25, page 1), DEC was manufacturing mainframe-class computersthroughout the 1970s and into the early 1980s.andM;Although most DEC users and watchers think only of minicomputers, there aremore than 500 customers worldwide for the DECsystem 10 and DECsystem 20computers, and hundreds of thousands of people used them.andP;  Although not aspowerful as today's IBM 3090 series, the DECsystem 10s and 20s were on par incompute power with the IBM 370s and supported far more interactive users.andP;  Infact, the DECsystem 10s and 20s were the workhorses of the computertime-sharing industry, as well as the mainstay of computing on major collegecampuses throughout the United States.andM;The DECsystem 10 and 20 may be only a footnote in DEChs history today, but 20years ago they were serious mainframe computers.andP;  Norbert J.
