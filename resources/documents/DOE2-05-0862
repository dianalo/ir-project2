In addition, in thefield of technological development, liquefaction and gasification ofcoal as the coal energy utilizing technology and commercialization ofsolar photovoltaic power generation and industrial solar systems as thesolar energy utilizing technology have been carried out. Furthermore,power generation utilizing the hot water and high temperature rocks havebeen chozen for study as the geothermal energy utilizing technology,the development of fuel cells and new power reserving systems have beenpursued as the fuel reserving technology and the technological developmentand the resource exploitation of alcohol and biomass have been carriedout.
