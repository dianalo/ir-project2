The datacover chest X-ray examinations. The dose values were obtained using differenttechniques, according to the specific diagnostic requirements in eachdepartement. A wide radiation dose range was observed between the differenttechniques, with a ratio between maximum and minimum dose andgt; 30 for theskin and the spine. The doses were however lower than those capable ofinducing non-stochastic effects by about 10000 and were so low that theprobability of a stochastics effect is minimal. Nevertheless, becausechest X-rays are performed so frequently, it is recommended that radiologiststake greater account of patient dose, as far as compatible with diagnosticrequirements. Radiology technicians must strictly observe the regulationsfor radioprotection of the patient.</TEXT></DOC>
