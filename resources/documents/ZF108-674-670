(products)Apple Computer Inc. (products).andO;Ticker:    MSFT; AAPL.andO;Product:   Microsoft Windows 3.0 (Graphical user interface) (market share)Apple Macintosh (Microcomputer) (market share).andO;Topic:     Graphical User InterfaceCompetitionComputer Industry.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Microsoft recently shipped Windows 3.0, its long-awaited new face-lift forIBM PCs and compatibles, and the world is divided into two camps about itsimpact on Macintosh.andP;  Camp No.andP;  I believes Windows 3.0 is a big nail inApple's coffin.andP;  Their thinking is that now that any old personal computercan have a graphical user interface, Apple won't have a chance.andP;  Camp No.andP;  2denies that Windows 3.0 is a threat at all.andP;  These people compare Windows 3.0to cheap plastic surgery, neon Spain, and a Ferrari body on a Volkswagenchassis.andM;I advocate another perspective: Windows 3.0 is the best thing for Macintoshsince PageMaker.andP;  Here's why:andM;THE MICROSOFT RIFLE ASSOCIATIONandM;First, Windows 3.0 reveals Microsoft's ambitious plan to totally control thepersonal-computer industry.andP;  There are four dominant operating systems in theindustry - DOS, Windows, Macintosh, and UNIX.andP;  Microsoft has had a major rolein the system and application software used in all four.andP;  Microsoft createdthe system software for DOS and Windows; it cross-licensed the Mac's Systemsoftware, and it could potentially dominate UNIX.andP;  In applications, Microsoftdominates the Mac, almost dominates DOS, is about to dominate Windows, and -well, with UNIX there's nothing to dominate.andM;In short, Microsoft is the National Rifle Association of personal computing.andO;It can tell Apple, IBM, and any other computer manufacturer what to do, justas the NRA tells Congress and President Bush what to do.andP;  Microsoft'sclaiming that Windows is a validation of the Macintosh interface is like theNRA's claiming that automatic weapons are an expression of free speech andthe right to bear arms.andM;Am I dreaming this up? Consider two pieces of evidence.andP;  First, mostapplication-software developers have to modify their products when Appleships new System software.andP;  Not Microsoft.andP;  Apple modifies its Systemsoftware to make sure that it will work with Microsoft's applications.andM;Second, Apple licensed Microsoft the look and feel of Windows 1.0.andP;  Do youthink Apple did this out of strength? Apple eventually sued Microsoft overWindows 2.0.andP;  But Apple and Microsoft then entered into cross-licensingagreements for PostScript-clone and font technology.andM;Key point: Microsoft is an awesome force that may control personal computing.andO;Although you may not agree with Microsoft (or the NRA), you have to respecthow it became so powerful.andP;  I sure wish I could say that I built Microsoft -and so does every software-company president.andM;HUMBLE PIEandM;Second, the Macintosh developers who port their applications to Windows 3.0are going to get a valuable lesson in humility.andP;  Back in 1984 and 1985, manyDOS-oriented companies swaggered into Apple and told it how they had theresources, technical expertise, and marketing clout to dominate the Macintoshsoftware market - companies such as AshtonTate, Software Publishing, andLotus, for example.andM;As unexpected, they failed.andP;  Now companies such as MacroMind and others areprobably emulating their swagger: &quot;We're big Macintosh studs.andP;  We've beenworking on GUI products for the past six years.andP;  We are going to clean up inthe Windows market.&quot; On the other side of the table, Microsoft's Windowsevangelists are nodding their heads, promising comarketing to suck them in,and laughing to themselves.andM;These Macintosh developers will fail - or at least will not succeed as wildlyas their spreadsheets have been telling them: &quot;Let's see, that's threemillion Windows units times 10-percent market share for me, equaling 300,000copies of my software.&quot; When they do fail, they will be born again: &quot;We'vedecided to get back to basics.andP;  We want to get closer to our customers andcreate more Macintosh products.&quot; Meanwhile, two punks in a garage with an80286 clone will create the products that actually ensure the success ofWindows 3.0.andM;Key point: As long as these companies come back to Macintosh, so what if theyleave for a while? Let them go, and welcome them back.andP;  If they don't comeback, forget them.andM;Two MACINTOSH GuysandM;IN A GARAGEandM;Third, suppose I'm wrong, and the Macintosh companies succeed in the Windowsmarket.andP;  That's OK too.andP;  As they are led by their wallets to the Windowsmarket, their absence will open up attractive opportunities in the Macintoshmarket for the rest of us.andM;Once again two guys in a garage with old Macintosh IIs will have a chance torise above today's noise in the Macintosh market and ship innovativeproducts.andM;Key point: If Macintosh has innovative software, so what if Windows succeeds?andO;Sometimes I plus I can equal 3.andM;EXPANSION, NOT CONVERSIONandM;Fourth, Windows 3.0 is going to solidify IBM PC bigotry, and Macintoshevangelists and Apple will stop wasting time trying to convert people.andO;Instead, they will focus on expanding the market for Macintosh.andM;Did you ever notice that the people who are the most loyal to IBM PCs havenever used a Macintosh? Their minds are completely closed: &quot;Macintosh is awimp machine.andP;  Just give me a macho text-based computer.&quot; Now they'll getWindows 3.0 and discover that they are more productive with a graphical userinterface, but they won't admit it to their Macintosh friends.andM;Instead the bigots will come up with more arguments such as &quot;With Windows, Ican always go back to a text-based system and its thousands of applications.&quot;andO;&quot;There's a lot more new software coming for Windows.&quot; &quot;Macintosh is tooexpensive.&quot; Etc., etc., etc.andP;  To which we should reply, &quot;Forget it.andP;  Forgetit.andP;  Forget it.&quot;andM;Key point: Let IBM PC bigots wallow in their mire.andP;  Let's evangelizeMacintosh in fields of milk and honey where it can increase the productivityand creativity of people who have never used a computer before.andM;BACK IN CUPERTINOandM;I'd like to mention that a fifth positive outcome is that Apple will becomefrightened and will work insanely hard to finish System 7, create newproducts, and reduce prices.andP;  But it's not likely.andM;Key point: Nothing is perfect.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
