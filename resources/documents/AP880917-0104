The rebels released the statement in Lisbon one day after PopeJohn Paul II arrived in Mozambique on the last part of a 10-daytour of southern Africa. John Paul urged Mozambique'sMarxist-oriented leaders to begin peace talks with the rebels.   In the statement, rebel movement leader Alfonso Dhlakama said hehoped John Paul's visit would contribute to peace in Mozambique,one of the world's poorest nations and one that has been wracked byinternal war since it gained independence from Portugal in 1975.   On Monday, the rebels declared a cease-fire in three areas ofthe country so residents could attend Masses celebrated by the pope.   The rebel statement said its forces on Sept. 1 attacked barrackshousing Mozambique government troops and Zimbabwean forces, killingnine Mozambican and seven Zimbabwean soldiers.   The statement said rebel forces on Monday killed 20 Mozambiquegovernment soldiers and nine Zimbabweans in clashes near Vila deMungari, southwest of the coastal city of Beira.   The rebel forces disputed what they said were government claimsthat rebel commander General Calisto Meque was killed in combat byMozambican troops in central Zambezia province.   The statement said Meque is alive and commanding rebel units inZambezia. The rebels also claimed they killed a government officerlate last month in an ambush in northern Cabo Delgado province.   The government forces _ backed by Zimbabwean, Tanzanian andMalawian troops _ have been fighting the right-wing guerrillas inMozambique since 1975.   The bitter struggle has forced 1 million Mozambicans to flee toneighboring countries and caused famine among an estimated 6million of the country's 14.5 million inhabitants.   The rebel forces, whose estimated 12,000 to 22,000 guerrillafighters formerly received backing from South Africa, have beenaccused of slaughtering civilians. The rebels deny the allegations.</TEXT></DOC>
