The properties involve nodal surfaces, coordinateand momentum space amplitude distribution, and phase space distribution.The eigenfunctions of the stadium billiard are examined, and it is foundthat the periodic orbits of shortest periods and smallest stability parameterprofoundly affect the iegenfunctions: &quot;scars&quot; of higher wavefunctiondensity surround the special periodic orbits. Finally a theory is presentedfor the scars, showing that they must exist, and relating them directlyto the special periodic orbits. These same periodic orbits cause leveldensity fluctuations.</TEXT></DOC>
