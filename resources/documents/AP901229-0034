Metro-Dade Mayor Steve Clark sent a proclamation designatingJune 26, 1988, Nelson Mandela Day. Clark uncovered the little-knownproclamation last weekend.   Organizers of the 5-month-old tourism boycott want Metro-Dade,Miami Beach and Miami to each award Mandela a proclamation and keysto the city - honors denied him during his visit last June.   ``Since your visit to Miami Beach last June,'' Clark wroteMandela on Thursday, ``controversy and misunderstanding havedeveloped over the lack of recognition given you by our localofficials.''   The 2-year-old proclamation shows that ``the fight which youhave waged for almost a quarter of a century in opposing thepolicies of apartheid in South Africa long has been recognized bymyself and the people of Metropolitan Dade County,'' he said.   Boycott organizer H.T. Smith said the action doesn't go farenough. ``The wrong occurred in 1990, and anything that happenedbefore that does not redress the wrong done in 1990,'' Smith said.``Because your boss gave you a raise in 1988 dos not at all makeup for him unfairly snubbing you in 1990.''</TEXT></DOC>
