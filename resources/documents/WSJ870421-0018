Dr. Jarvik, who is said to hold about 8% of Symbion's 7.4 million shares, had earlier opposed the offer in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, saying the $3.50 a share, or $8.8 million, bid was too low and should be withdrawn.    In a statement, Dr. Jarvik, co-inventor of the Jarvik-7 artificial heart for which Symbion is noted, said he would tender all his shares to Warburg Pincus under the offer. He didn't elaborate and couldn't be reached for comment.    Symbion, however, in a separate statement, hinted that Dr. Jarvik may intend to leave the company. While it would &quot;regret his disassociation,&quot; Symbion said it &quot;doesn't believe that the future of the company is dependent upon any one individual.&quot;    The company said it was responding to a statement by Dr. Jarvik, in his SEC filing, in which he asserted that Symbion's prospects &quot;are likely to depend substantially&quot; upon his future efforts.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Symbion shares closed at $3.25, down 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
