A year earlier, the company paid 40 francs a share andeight francs a dividend-rights certificate.</LP><TEXT>   The setback in results was widely expected after theturbulent market conditions Swissair and other airlines facedlast year. Still, the stock declined sharply. It closedyesterday at 760 francs, down 15, in trading here.   After accounting for minority shareholders, the group lossamounted to 22 million francs against a profit of 169 millionfrancs in 1989. Swissair said &quot;two-thirds of this decline canbe ascribed to the operating result, and one-third to thefinancial loss&quot; on stakes it holds in other companies.   Group operating revenue rose 3.4% in 1990 to 5.23 billionfrancs from 5.08 billion in 1989, the airline said. But groupoperating profit fell 58%, to 100 million francs from 239million the year before, largely because of the&quot;disappointing results&quot; from flight operations.   A group financial loss of 92 million francs, Swissairsaid, stemmed mainly from lower values of some of its stakesin other companies, although this was ameliorated by anupward adjustment of its holding in the travel group Kuoni.   Explaining the poor results, executives blamed high costs,the Gulf war, higher fuel prices, a strong Swiss franc andpoor results from flight operations.   But Swissair said it realized a 70 million-franc profitfrom the sale of three DC-10 jetliners.   Management indicated the outlook for 1991 is uncertain,but that with the end of the Gulf war there are growing signsof an upturn in travel. And, executives said, the company hasput a brake on costs, which rose 7.7% last year.   Management disclosed that Swissair will boost its holdingin Swiss regional airline Crossair AG to a 51.9% voting stakefrom 41%. Management described the move as a &quot;friendlytakeover&quot; and said Crossair will remain an independentconcern.</TEXT></DOC>
