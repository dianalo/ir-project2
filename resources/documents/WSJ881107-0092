Vice President George Bush and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis have sidestepped most major foreign-policy issues the next president will face. For example, Mr. Bush says he supports military aid to the Nicaraguan Contras, but he hasn't given a clue as to what he would do if Congress just says no.    Mr. Dukakis opposes aid to the Contras, but can't say what he would do if the Organization of American States is unable to usher in an era of peace and democracy in Central America. Neither candidate has tried to use the campaign to forge a centrist policy that might have a chance to succeed both on Capitol Hill and in Central America.    Similarly, Mr. Bush says he wants at least one new type of land-based strategic missile, two new aircraft-carrier battle groups, a 600-ship Navy and billions of dollars a year in strategic defense research, but his lips say, &quot;No new taxes.&quot; Gov. Dukakis says he favors modernizing the nation's nuclear arsenal, but even some of his advisers wonder if his heart still says, &quot;No, no, no.&quot; Neither candidate has demonstrated much leadership in the search for a reasonable compromise between a sound economy and a strong defense.    But ducking important tactical questions pales by comparison with the candidates' absolute failure to address the central strategic issue facing the U.S. in the last decade of the 20th century: How to advance the nation's interests in a world no longer dominated by two superpowers, one in which economic competition may pose a greater threat to the well-being of Americans than Soviet military power.    Mr. Bush acknowledges such a diffusion of power, and Mr. Dukakis says he wants &quot;to restore respect for American leadership in a changing world.&quot; But neither man has demonstrated that he understands what is changing, or that he has any idea how the world's increasing interest in economic pragmatism -- which now concerns even the Kremlin -- rather than ideology or brute strength, ought to play into America's hands. In fact, Gov. Dukakis's latest pronouncements have had a protectionist ring.    Past realignments of world power have been mirrored in some of the nation's presidents. Theodore Roosevelt, the Rough Rider, spurred the still-young America onto the world stage, and Woodrow Wilson tried to marry the nation's newfound power to its oldest ideals. Franklin Roosevelt understood that isolationism was a luxury America -- and democracy -- couldn't afford. Harry Truman's policy of containment reflected the nation's postwar sense of its manifest destiny. John Kennedy embodied the romantic optimism of a new American generation that thought it knew what to do for the world. Ronald Reagan helped the country regain its self-confidence after a period of drift and doubt.    If the campaign is any reflection, neither Michael Dukakis nor George Bush is a Roosevelt, Truman, Kennedy or Reagan. Two candidates did begin to describe their notions of America's role in a changing world, but they were Gary Hart and Jesse Jackson.    The &quot;Jackson doctrine&quot; was eclipsed by other issues, including the candidate's race, and by fears that his prescription called for the U.S. to switch sides and to begin supporting Third World liberation movements the same way Ronald Reagan supported anti-communist insurgencies. Mr. Hart's insights, though thoughtful, were lost in a deluge of reports on his personal life.    In the past, America has had time and strength to catch up with change, and for its presidents to grow into the job. But the pace of change is accelerating. The bureaucracy and the Congress, like many corporations, aren't equipped to think beyond the next quarter, much less coordinate foreign political, military, and economic strategy as the Japanese do.    John L. Peterson, who headed a two-year study of the diffusion of power in the world, concludes that the U.S. has, at best, 20 years to adapt. The 1988 election was one of those years wasted. </TEXT></DOC>
