 Databases need no introduction, but we explain the datamanagement market and offer advice on how to make this difficult choice.andM;Choosing a databaseandM;Choosing a database is a matter for careful consideration.andP;  Future plans areas relevant as current requirements.andP;  Every database programmer has clientswho wanted 'a simple database we can use to keep track of our contacts andsend them updated mailings.'andP;  Once you've done that, it soon becomes apparentthat the same data can be the basis for any number of interesting and vastlymore complex plans.andM;Relational terminologyandM;The simplest database managers are extensions of card-index systems, wherebythe familiar scribbled 3x5-inch card is translated into its electronicequivalent.andP;  These are called Flat-file Database Managers and are often quitecomplex.andP;  Usually, they can store all the data that previously resided oncards and can also maintain several separate indices so that the informationcan be extracted or viewed by reference to names, addresses, or other keyfields.andP;  They can't normally create intelligent connections between differentphysical data files.andM;In order to create complex links between data held in disparate files, someform of common index is required.andP;  It may be a name field, a customer number,or a combination derived from such fields.andP;  Whatever the method used, thedatabase is likely to be called a Relational Database, and the data will berepresented as tables resembling a spreadsheet with column headingsrepresenting field names, and the rows being individual records.andM;Linking dataandM;However, the blurring of terminology isn't necessarily bad news.andP;  dBase IIused to be subtitled The Relational Database Manager, but it would be hard tofind dBase III or IV described thus today.andP;  Nevertheless, dBase and virtuallyall other database managers in the PC world have moved inexorably torelational methods by which separate data files are linked when required bymeans of common fields.andM;A relational database offers the best way of starting with future expansionin mind.andP;  Data is no longer cordoned off in isolated files, but is insteadavailable to multiple access by virtue of common fields.andP;  Whereas a contactlist maintained by a flat-file database manager is limited to simpleoperations such as searching, sorting and printing, a similar list maintainedby a relational database manager forms the basis of customer, supplier, stockand ledger files where common data can be held in one location, but used inmany different views.andM;HardwareandM;In the '90s new advances are likely to be made in user interfaces and inextracting better performance by making better use of the hardware platformsavailable.andM;For a while now FoxBase has had a specific version tuned to 80386-basedboxes.andP;  The 386 has its own memory management techniques which offertremendous advantages for the database managers which make use of them.andO;However, the same advantages aren't available to 8088/86 and 80286 userswithout delving into complex memory-switching schemes.andP;  Paradox also has a386-version and an OS/2 version which runs on 386 and 286 machines, but OS/2has its own problems and advantages.andP;  While the ability to run multipleapplications simultaneously is doubtless a good thing, OS/2 requires reams ofmemory to do it seriously, and preferably a 386 rather than a 286.andM;Operating systemsandM;No matter how close software gets to catching up with leading-edge hardware,it isn't possible for database vendors to ignore the vast installed base of8088/8086 computers or the slowly increasing numbers of Unix machines beinginstalled.andP;  Users who're used to the relatively unsophisticated interfaces onolder 8088/86 database managers, may not be totally sold on the benefits ofincreased speed of access if they have to learn a completely new interface,even if it is easier to use, as graphical interfaces undoubtedly are.andM;So, while it's preferable to choose a powerful database manager for dataapplications which are projected to grow incrementally, it's also necessaryto take into account the installed base of machines and the likelihood ofmigrating the applications upwards to more complex operating systems.andO;Fortunately, there are already several vendors with multiple versions whichrun across a wide range of hardware platforms and operating systems withsimilar interfaces.andM;ConnectivityandM;Networks are another area where hardware advances have made the databasevendors look again.andP;  Network users want databases that work withoutendangering data-integrity but which also work fast.andP;  Network users also wantaccess to all the data available.andP;  They don't want to be restricted to dataheld in proprietary file formats if their division has a database managerwith a different file format.andM;The solutions now being put into practice are tied up with a query languagedeveloped by IBM, and a new open approach to sharing data that cuts throughthe chains that database managers tied around their data formats in the '70sand early '80s, in order to 'lock' end-users into their products.andP;  Instead ofharmonizing on a single database manager, users will be able to use the onethey're most familiar with, or one that suits their needs mostsatisfactorily.andM;Client-server architectureandM;The path to this data nirvana was first put into practice by Wayne Ratliffe,former Voyager mission programmer, and progenitor of dBase II which startedPCs on the database road.andP;  His Eagle database engine separated the 'back-end'data processor from the 'front-end' application processor.andP;  This separationis the key to the current trend towards client-server architecture wherebythe front-end application used by users may or may not come from the samevendor as the database engine which delivers the data requested by the userapplication.andM;Once the front-end application is in a position to communicate with a numberof different database engines, the problem of seamless integration of data isessentially solved.andP;  It will not matter to users whether their data is heldin a Paradox, dBase or mainframe database, because it will all be availablethrough the front-end tools their application provides.andP;  These tools may beas simple as a Structured Query Language (SQL) interpreter, or as complex ascan be devised using programming interfaces such as Paradox' newly availableapplication programmer's interface.andM;For creating, querying and maintaining databases, SQL is the best possiblecommon denominator currently available.andP;  Using SQL in conjunction withclient-server architecture ensures the processing power of the server runningon a powerful hardware platform is devoted to fulfilling requests forspecific data, rather than having to deliver whole chunks of a database toensure that the client application running on a workstation actually receivesthe bits it needs.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
