However, State Department officials believe that the optimism masks enduring difficulties. The problems include reduced superpower influence over often-cantankerous allies and the Kremlin's continued use of political discussions to gain legitimacy for its clients while reducing congressional enthusiasm for anti-communist insurgents.    &quot;There is more of a discussion than before, but that isn't the same as a change in policy,&quot; says former Pentagon official Richard Perle. He argues that Moscow won't make real concessions until it sees the cost-benefit balance turn against it. &quot;These talks could confuse the public about the source of Soviet motivation,&quot; says Mr. Perle, who argues that the U.S. provision of anti-aircraft Stinger missiles to anti-communist guerrillas, rather than the Geneva talks, forced Moscow to accept the Afghan peace accords.    U.S. officials say the next test of U.S.-Soviet efforts to solve regional conflicts will be southern Africa. In Moscow, the superpowers set Sept. 29 as a target date for a solution.    Most U.S. officials believe such a date is unrealistic; vast differences remain between the Angolans, Cubans and South Africans on the timing and details of a plan that would bring independence to Namibia, which South Africa administers in defiance of United Nations decisions and world opinion, in conjunction with a Cuban troop pullout from neighboring Angola and a reconciliation that would ensure that Angola's civil war didn't break out again.    Despite potential problems, Chester Crocker, assistant secretary of state for African affairs, sees reason for hope. He says that the Soviets want to reduce the financial drain of aiding Angola and that the South Africans may prefer to deal now with the Reagan administration rather than risk facing a less-friendly successor. For its part, the Angolan government needs a way out of the war after its disastrous last offensive. All this provides a historic opportunity, he believes.    Many other State Department officials dismiss Mr. Crocker's hopes. He's negotiating with &quot;one country that's hardly talking to us {South Africa} and two {Angola and Cuba} with whom we don't even have diplomatic relations,&quot; one official says.    &quot;Crocker is a master of souffle,&quot; the official says. &quot;He takes an egg, puts a lot of air in the middle, then whips it up to make it look like more than it is.&quot; Mr. Crocker responds: &quot;Any diplomat who can't make souffle isn't a good diplomat.&quot;    His critics see Mr. Crocker's optimism as the most extreme example of unrealistic expectations that have been raised by U.S.-Soviet talks on regional problems.    U.S.-Soviet influence on regional disputes has eroded. The U.S. hasn't been able to deliver Israel to an international peace conference, and Washington's influence over sanctions-squeezed South Africa is even less. The Kremlin is wary of alienating Vietnam, Syria, Angola and Cuba -- key players in regional conflicts but each also the Kremlin's best foothold in its part of the world.    U.S. officials say that regional talks at the summit were the most open yet. But the talks also illustrated the remaining pitfalls. U.S. officials are concerned that the Vietnamese, while withdrawing 50,000 troops, nominally placed the other half under Cambodian government control. This suggests the troops may stay for some time and betrays efforts aimed at increasing the current regime's legitimacy.    The Soviets promised nothing that would help the U.S. advance the Middle East peace process. Nor has Moscow done anything to reduce military supplies to Angola, Vietnam, Afghanistan and Nicaragua.    Moscow's intransigence on working toward an arms embargo to end the Iran-Iraq war leads U.S. officials to believe the Kremlin and Iran have reached a tacit agreement under which the Soviets slow U.N. action against Tehran and the Iranians don't impede the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan. &quot;When it suits them, they'll cooperate with us,&quot; shrugs one State Department official. &quot;When it doesn't suit them, they won't.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
