In an announcement made at the end of business Friday, the company said its chairman, William B. Ruger, made the bid. The company didn't disclose terms, and company officials weren't available to provide further details.    Sturm Ruger said Smith andamp; Wesson, based in Springfield, Mass., is among the companies being sold by Lear Siegler Holdings Corp. The holding company was formed by the $2.1 billion leveraged buyout in December by Forstmann Little andamp; Co. of Lear Siegler Inc., a Santa Monica, Calif.-based aerospace and industrial company. Forstmann Little is a New York-based investment firm specializing in leveraged buyouts. In late February, the holding company said it plans to sell several Lear Siegler units acquired in the leveraged buyout. Lear Siegler officials couldn't be reached for comment.    In 1986, Sturm Ruger earned $6.03 million, or $1.80 a share, on sales of $87 million.    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets. </TEXT></DOC>
