Attorney R. Kenneth Mundy, in a motion filed in U.S. DistrictCourt, said the eight-count drug possession and perjury caseagainst Barry should be dropped because prosecutors allowed themayor to use drugs before arresting him.   Mundy accused the government of ``prosecutorial overreach'' forsupplying the crack cocaine and cocaine pipe Barry used.   ``This over-involvement is unprecedented,'' Mundy wrote in themotion released Wednesday. ``There appears to be no case in whichsuch elaborate and dangerous preparations were employed to provethat a suspect was a mere user.''   In earlier filings, U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens argued thatprosecutors routinely provide illegal drugs to suspects inundercover drug buys.   Mundy had complained that the government's action had beencoercive, but Stephens cited a Supreme Court ruling that suchprocedures were commonly used ``in contraband offenses, which areso difficult to detect in the absence of undercover governmentinvolvement.''   Stephens also argued in the earlier filing that ``to require theagent to interrupt the use of the controlled substance likely wouldcompromise the investigation.''   But Mundy, noting that medical technicians were present toexamine the mayor after he used the cocaine, argued that thegovernment acted illegally in allowing the mayor to smoke thecocaine.   ``The fact that the medical technicians were available does notmake the government's conduct any less offensive,'' Mundy said.``It only corroborates the fact that they knew the plan waspotentially life-threatening.''   Mundy concluded by referring to previous cases which weredismissed because prosecutors used ``coercion, violence orbrutality.''   Stephens has until Monday to file a response to Mundy's pleading.   Barry, 54, faces five misdemeanor cocaine possession charges andthree felony counts of lying to a grand jury about his drug use.The trial is scheduled to start June 4.   One of the possession charges stems from his Jan. 18 arrest inthe undercover FBI sting operation, while the other four possessioncharges and the perjury counts come from a 16-month probe intoBarry's ties to a convicted drug dealer.   Meanwhile, the executive committee of the District of ColumbiaDemocratic State Committee was expected to present a resolutiontoday to the full committee asking Barry not to seek re-electionthis year, WTTG-TV reported Wednesday.   The resolution urged Barry ``to consider the best interests ofthe citizens ... (and) not seek re-nomination in 1990,'' accordingto the television station.   The mayor, who aides said intends to run for re-election inNovember, went through seven weeks of substance abuse treatmentfollowing his arrest.   Barry has said he was suffering from alcoholism, but top aidessaid he had a cocaine problem as well. Barry has not yet publiclyrevealed his re-election plans.   If convicted of a felony, Barry would be barred from holdingoffice or running for re-election.</TEXT></DOC>
