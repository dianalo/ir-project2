The overall objective of the research program was to producea robot-controlled excavation system to expose utility pipes and otherobjects with improved safety and greater productivity. The specific objectivesincluded: to develop a primary excavator system designed to dig trenchesadjacent to pipe networks; to develop a secondary excavator system toremove in a benign manner the prism of soil not removed by the primaryexcavator that still covered the pipe network; to develop a central intelligenceexecutive controller; i.e., computer and required software; to developthe controller hardware, including transducers, servos, and feedbacksystems; to develop a sensor and data processing system to recognizeburied metal pipes with the requisite sensing techniques, processingroutines, imaging, and interpretation; to develop a sensor system todetect buried plastic pipe.</TEXT></DOC>
