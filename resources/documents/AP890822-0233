JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Environmental Protection Agency beganfiling lawsuits today in nearly a dozen states against demolitioncompanies that allegedly failed to take proper precautions whileworking on asbestos-ridden buildings.   Civil lawsuits were filed by the Justice Department in eightcities and additional court papers were expected to be filed laterin the day naming a total of 34 defendants in connection withviolations of asbestos removal requirements, the EPA said.   ``Today's coast-to-coast effort to punish violators is a messageto those who ignore the law,'' said Henry Habicht, EPA deputyadministrator. ``Asbestos is a known cause of cancer in humans, andit can be a killer.''   Habicht said the agency intends to enforce requirements forsafety measures when dealing with asbestos removal by seeking civilpenalties from companies that do not comply with the safeguards.Fines could range up to $25,000 for each violation.   The EPA officials declined to name all the defendants until thecourt papers were filed. The eight lawsuits filed today involvedwork on school buildings in Missouri, Kansas and Washington state aswell as various buildings from warehouses to restaurants inVirginia, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Nevada.   Papers also were being prepared for civil action involving workon at least 80 school buildings in New York City, officials said.   Federal law requires certain precautions when removing asbestosfrom buildings so that its microscopic fibers are not spread throughthe air. Violators can be subject to up to $25,000 fine perviolation and face criminal prosecution in some cases.   The inhalation of asbestos fibers is known to cause lung cancer,asbestosis, a scarring of the lung, and mesothelioma, a cancer ofthe chest and abdomen. Asbestos was used in past years in insulationand other building materials.   Improper removal practices pose health risks to constructionworkers and people who return to the building or to other nearbybuildings since asbestos particles often linger in the air for along time, EPA officials said.   The EPA estimates that up to half of all asbestos-involvedrenovations may be done without the precautions required by thefederal Clean Air Act.   The EPA officials said none of the new actions involves criminalcharges, but that civil penalties in some of the cases could be over$250,000.   Agency sources, who asked not to be identified by name, saidpapers were also to be filed later in the day as a result ofviolations in New York, California and Florida.   The projects cited include work on at least 80 New York Cityschool buildings; public schools in Woodinville and Kent, Wash.; ahigh school in Kansas City, Mo.; a junior high school in Holyrood,Kan.; and colleges in Pittsburg, Kan., and Berea, Ohio.   In one case, a contractor was being cited for transporting winetanks by helicopter from a winery in San Jose, Calif., withoutremoving asbestos insulation pads, causing asbestos particles toscatter over miles of countryside.   Other cases involved a Nevada casino; an apartment building inPhiladelphia; a boiler room at the Marine Corps base at Quantico,Va.; the Seattle-Tacoma Airport, and two Seattle restaurants.   The EPA crackdown comes only weeks after a Harvard Universitystudy indicated that in many cases the improper removal of asbestosfrom buildings may pose more of a health risk than leaving thematerial in the building.   The study by Harvard's Energy and Environmental Policy Centersuggested that if precautions are not taken the ``removal ofasbestos may actually increase exposure to building occupants'' aswell as workers involved in the renovation.   The EPA has estimated that more than 730,000 commercial buildingsin the country still contain some asbestos material. Last year itreceived about 50,000 notifications of renovation projects involvingasbestos, and that number is expected to increase by about 30percent this year, according to agency officials.   By law, the EPA must be notified when renovation or demolitionsinvolve buildings containing asbestos.</TEXT></DOC>
