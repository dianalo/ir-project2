The 24-year-old university student tapped into the worldwidecomputers for nearly two years through telephone links, accordingto the West German newsmagazine Quick.   West German authorities dropped their case, however, for lack ofevidence. FBI spokesmen said they were investigating but declinedto say if charges would be brought.   ``The (Bremen) court decided it could not be proven whooriginated these calls,'' said Hans-Georg von Bock, a prosecutingattorney in Bremen.   He said the hacker scoured California computers at the Air ForceSystems Command in El Segundo, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory inPasedena, and the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley.   Bock refused to say what the hacker, who lives in the northerncity of Hanover, discovered. Quick said he was able to find out thenames of U.S. Army officers in Japan and details about U.S. coastalsecurity systems.   Authorities did not say if any important secrets were robbed.   Bock said he remained convinced of the Hanover man's guilt. ``Wewanted to catch the suspect committing the acts, but unfortunatelythat did not happen,'' he said.   The prosecutor said West German investigators had been hamperedbecause law only allows wiretaps to investigate more serious crimeslike murder. A telephone tap would have enabled West Germanauthorities to trace the suspect's calls.   Computer hackers use telephone connections to gain unauthorizedaccess to other computers, often just for fun.   Bock said the computer connections in this case were made bytelephone via a computer at Bremen University.   Quick said a connection with the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratoryallowed the hacker to link to computers worldwide. However, themagazine did not provide further details or identify the hacker.   Bock said he could provide no details about the hacker becausethe West German investigation had been dropped.   Quick said the electronic break-ins were detected in August 1986by the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, which does broad-basedunclassified research.   The laboratory and its companion institution, the LawrenceLivermore Laboratory, which researches nuclear weapons and theReagan administratoin's space-based missile defense system, areoperated by the University of California for the U.S. government.   Quick said authorities questioned the suspect in June and thatthe break-ins stopped at about the same time.</TEXT></DOC>
