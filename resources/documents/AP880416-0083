One masked gunman, addressing three reporters at the top of thegangway leading to the plane, said the hijackers ``are now workingto blow up this plane'' if 17 terrorists jailed in Kuwait are notfreed.   ``We are determined to obtain the liberation of our 17 brothers.In view of the Kuwaiti intransigence, we are asking our Algerianbrothers to refuel the plane so that we can take off because weintend to settle our score with Kuwait somewhere else.   ``We do not want the massacre to take place here in friendlyAlgeria, which welcomed us and which tried to settle the problem.''   He said, however, that they were not abandoning the negotiatingprocess and remained willing to examine ``every proposal.''   The hijackers have killed two hostages during the 12 day ordeal.   Three hijackers, all wearing light blue hoods and one of themcarrying a machine gun, were seen by the journalists, representingThe New York Times, the French news agency Agence France-Presse andthe Algerian government agency Algerie Presse Service.   The statement was read in Arabic by one of the three who werestanding in the plane's doorway. Nothing was visible inside theplane.   The reporters were frisked at the bottom of the gangway by theman who read the statement.   They were each allowed to ask two questions after the statementwas read, and the entire episode lasted about 15 minutes.   One asked if it was possible to envisage a solution whereby thehostages would be freed in Algeria and the hijackers would leave.   The reply was: ``A solution will be proposed to us and we willexamine it together with our Algerian brothers in a comprehensivemanner. We must have a comprehensive solution.''   The response appeared to soften the tone of other remarks,indicating that the crisis could still be solved in Algeria.   Negotiations, which began today at 10:40 a.m., were expected tocontinue.   The Kuwait Airways Boeing 747 was hijacked April 5 with 112people aboard on a flight from Bangkok to Kuwait. Fifty-sevenpassengers were released in Mashhad, Iran. The hijackers killed twohostages in Larnaca, Cyprus, and released 13 before flying to theAlgerian capital on Wednesday.   The hijackers are demanding that Kuwait free 17 pro-Iranianextremists convicted of bombing the U.S. and French embassies inKuwait in 1983. Kuwait has refused.   On Friday, Algerian mediators shuttled between Kuwaiti officialsand the plane, entering to talk with hijackers at least five times.Two of the hostages pleaded for their lives via radio in an appealto the Kuwaiti government to give in to the hijackers' demand.   ``In the name of God the merciful, I greet my family and myfriends and I ask the Kuwaiti authorities to free the 17 prisonersheld in Kuwaiti prisons,'' one hostage, Soleiman Mohammed Soleimanal-Mashari, in a message to the control tower Friday. ``In theevent of refusal, they are going to kill us.''   Reagan administration and Western intelligence sources said theybelieve one of the eight hijackers is Hasan Ezzidine, a Lebanesenational under U.S. indictment for the June 1985 hijacking of theTWA airliner.   One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said theUnited States is seeking Ezzidine's extradition. The sources saidwithout elaboration that a coded radio message from Beirut to theaircraft mentioned the name Ezzidine.   Ezzidine may have been directly involved in the killing ofRobert Dean Stethem, a Navy diver beaten and shot to death duringthe TWA hijacking, today's New York Times quoted administrationofficials as saying.   The intelligence sources say they believe the seizure of theKuwaiti plane was masterminded by Imad Mughniyeh, another of thefour Lebanese Shiite militants indicted by U.S. authorities for theTWA hijacking.   They said Mughniyeh, 36, dropped out of sight in Beirut severalweeks ago after returning from Iran. Mughniyeh is a security chieffor the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, a Lebanese Shiitefundamentalist faction.   Hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella organization forpro-Iranian Shiite Moslem groups holding 22 foreign hostages,including nine Americans, in Lebanon.   Some freed passengers said the gunmen were joined by another manafter the plane was forced to land in Iran.   Algeria denied it had guaranteed that hostages aboard theaircraft would be freed when the plane reached Algiers, reinforcinga sense of stalemate in negotiations as the crisis entered its 12thday.   ``Algeria agreed to welcome the plane at the express demand ofthe Kuwaiti government and with a strictly humanitarian goal,'' agovernment statement said Friday.   Cyprus government spokesman Akis Fantis had said his governmentreceived assurances from unspecified ``sources in Algiers'' thatthe hostages and the plane would be released.   Among the hostages are three members of Kuwait's large Al-Sabahroyal family and at least four crew members.</TEXT></DOC>
