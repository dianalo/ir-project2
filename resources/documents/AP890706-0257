Jefferies, who admitted to an illegalstock scheme with inside trader Ivan Boesky, was spared a jail termThursday by a federal judge who praised his cooperation but calledWall Street greed ``absurd and probably obscene.''   U.S. District Judge Morris Lasker sentenced Jefferies to fiveyears probation and fined him $250,000. Jefferies, who pleadedguilty to two felonies, provided information and testimony in thegovernment's continuing securities fraud investigations in exchangefor leniency.   Jefferies, 58, had faced a maximum 10 years in jail and $500,000fine.   ``Mr. Jefferies has by now earned his way through agony andeffort to a suspended sentence,'' Lasker told a packed room at U.S.District Court in Manhattan.   But Lasker added a message he addressed to the financialcommunity.   ``It is absurb and probably obscene for any person so engaged toundertake acts which will possibly bring him greater riches,'' hesaid. ``This country is beginning to awake I hope, however, to themorally corrupting effect of thinking of oneself only.''   Jefferies was fined $125,000 on each of two counts for helpingBoesky conceal the true ownership of $56 million in stock in 1985and scheming with speculator Salim B. ``Sandy'' Lewis to manipulatethe stock price of Fireman's Fund Corp. in 1986   ``I want to apologize to the court, to apologize to thegovernment, to apologize to my friends and family who have given meso much support,'' Jefferies told the court, his voice cracking.   In his 1987 plea deal, Jefferies also resigned from the LosAngeles brokerage he founded in 1962 and was banished from thesecurities business for at least five years. The soonest he canreapply for a securities license is July 1992.   While stating he believed Jefferies was aware he was breaking thelaw, Lasker noted that Jefferies was not charged with trading oninside information and did not personally profit from the deals.   He said he also received letters ``which have really hit my heartand made me feel there is no question that you are a good man.''   Jefferies has provided the government with information leading tothree indictments and one conviction. He testified earlier this yearthat he helped GAF Corp. manipulate the price of Union Carbide Corp.stock, although that case twice ended in a mistrial.   He also told a jury he illegally held stock for Florida investorPaul A. Bilzerian, who was convicted last month in the first trialsuccess of the government's three-year securities fraud crackdown.   Jefferies is to testify at the third GAF trial and the trial ofLewis, both scheduled to begin in the fall.   U.S. Attorney Benito Romano praised Jefferies' cooperation withthe government, including his testimony, 37 meetings withprosecutors, repeated trips across country and identification ofdocuments.   ``Mr. Jefferies' cooperation has made a significant contributionto the government's effort to expose, punish and deter conduct whichwe believe Mr. Jefferies acknowledges undermines the integrity ofthe securities markets,'' Romano said.   He added Jefferies' efforts deserved ``substantial appropriatecredit.'' The government did not issue a presentencingrecommendation.   Lasker had sentenced Boesky _ who implicated Jefferies _ to threeyears in prison in 1987. Boesky pleaded guilty to one felony countand paid $100 million to settle insider trading charges with thegovernment.   Experts said Jefferies' suspended sentence would be regarded as aslap on the wrist on Wall Street. Based on the Boesky sentence,defense lawyers and legal scholars had expected Jefferies to receiveless, but some, jail time.   ``I think it will send a message that if you are willing to paythe price in dollars and incriminating other people you can go backhome,'' said Alan Bromberg, a securities law professor at SouthernMethodist University.   After sentencing, Jefferies, tanned and smoking a cigarette, toldreporters he had been prepared for some jail time.   ``I was expecting much worse,'' he said. ``I think Judge Laskerweighed the negatives and all the positives and I think I've reallydone a lot for the industry.''   Jefferies established his Los Angeles-based Jefferies andamp; Co.brokerage firm 25 years ago and worked 16-hour days makingmultimillion-share transactions for some of Wall Street's mostimportant He said he would like to return to the brokerage businesswhen he is permitted.   Jefferies is now living in Aspen, Colo., where he runs a golfclinic for underprivileged children. He also works with two otheryouth programs, one of which was formed after his only son died in acar crash.</TEXT></DOC>
