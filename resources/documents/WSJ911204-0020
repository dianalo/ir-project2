A full month after Airbus said it would deliver to theEuropean Community Commission a detailed accounting of itsaccusations, the consortium informed the EC's executive bodythat no complaint is imminent.</LP><TEXT>   In its initial memorandum, Airbus accused British Airwaysof heading a conspiracy involving rival manufacturer BoeingCo. and engine maker General Electric Co. that kept Airbusfrom winning an order valued at as much as $6.85 billionplaced by the U.K. carrier last August. Airbus officialscharged that, among other things, British Airways askedBoeing to submit a bid price for a greater number of planesthan was asked of Airbus, thereby enabling the U.S.manufacturer to offer greater discounts. From the start,British Airways has denied the allegations.   Airbus's failure to take any further action was madepublic yesterday by the commission -- a move industryofficials viewed as an attempt to chastise Airbus for itspublic handling of the issue. But a spokesman for Airbus saidthe consortium may yet take action. &quot;We're not excluding {thepossibility} that we may file a formal complaint.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
