Before the report Tuesday, the Communist government ofAfghanistan said 165 rockets had hit Kabul and other cities sinceMay 15, when Soviet troops began withdrawing under an agreementmediated by the United Nations.   Most attacks have been aimed at the capital, where thegovernment of President Najib said rockets killed 20 people Friday.   Moslem guerrillas began fighting in Afghanistan after aCommunist coup in April 1978 and Soviet military forces entered thecountry in December 1979. Under the April 14 Geneva agreement, theestimated 115,000 Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan are to be out byFeb. 15, 1989.   The insurgents, most of whom are based in Pakistan, deny firingrockets into residential areas. Abdul Haq, a commander with theHezb-i-Islami guerrilla group led by Younis Khalis, said theirtargets in Kabul are military installations, the Soviet Embassy andthe airport.   Haq claimed most rockets that hit civilians are fired by theSoviets or government forces in an attempt to discredit theinsurgents.   Kabul radio said the government had lodged its 53rd complaintwith the U.N. observer team, accusing Pakistan, Afghanistan'seastern neighbor, of violating the Geneva accord.   More than 5 million Afghans _ about one-third of the population_ have fled their country in a decade of civil war. At least 3million live in camps and cities along the frontier with Pakistanthat serve as bases and supply points for the guerrillas.   Pakistan and Afghanistan signed the agreement. It is guaranteedby the Soviet Union and the United States, which supports theinsurgents. The guerrillas were not a party to it and havecontinued fighting.   Western diplomats in Islamabad, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said recent bombing raids by the Afghan air force in thesouth killed 70 villagers and 16 insurgents.   They reported heavy fighting in the Kandahar area of southernAfghanistan and said guerrillas claimed to have overrun thegarrison town of Shahr-i-Safa, 35 miles north of Kandahar on thestrategic highway to Kabul, last Friday.   The diplomats gave these reports of activity in easternAghanistan:   No supply convoys have reached the besieged city of Asmar in thenortheastern Kunar province since one got through in mid-June fromJalalabad, 70 miles to the south.   Most civilians have abandoned the Asmar area at the northernedge of the Kunar Valley, scene of heavy fighting in July, and theprovincial capital Asadabad, 18 miles to the south, may fall soon.   Guerrilla positions in the mountains above the Kunar Valley makeresupply by air difficult and soldiers in Urgun, 18 miles from thePakistan border, receive air drops only at night. The same systemis used at the besieged city of Khost in Paktia province.</TEXT></DOC>
