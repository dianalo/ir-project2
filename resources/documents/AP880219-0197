It was the deadliest civilian attack in the territory's22-year guerrilla war for independence.   The blast in the northern town of Oshakati killed 10 women,three men and a child and injured 31 people, most of themseriously, said an army spokesman, Commandant Lieb Bester.   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the bombing, whichdestroyed the First National Bank building. Five people wereinjured when the same bank was bombed a year ago.   All those killed, a white woman and 13 blacks, were civilians,Bester said. Most were believed to be government workers who hadjust received their paychecks.   A police inspector, Keirie Du Rand, said about 55 pounds ofplastic explosives were used in the blast, which occurred shortlybefore 1 p.m. Anfire raged for several hours after the explosion,hampering police access.   Oshakati is about 25 miles south of the Angolan border and ishome to the largest military base in the region, a staging pointfor South Africa's military intervention in Angola's civil war.   Guerrillas of the South-West African People's Organization(SWAPO), based in Angola, frequently operate in the Ovambo regionaround Oshakati.   SWAPO has been fighting since 1966 to gain control of South-WestAfrica, also known as Namibia. The territory is administered bySouth Africa in violation of a United Nations resolution.   A statement received in Windhoek, the territorial capital, froma SWAPO office in Luanda, Angola, denied involvement. The statementsaid the blast was part of a South African propaganda campaign to``smear the name of SWAPO.''   SWAPO has claimed responsibility for previous bombings in theterritory, including a blast last month at a store at a militarybase in Windhoek. The bombing, which caused no injuries, wasintended to protest the visit to Namibia of conservative WestGerman politician Franz Josef Strauss.   The worst previous bombing in the region occurred in 1986 in theport town of Walvis Bay, a South African enclave near the center ofNamibia's Atlantic Coast. Five people were killed and 23 injured inthat explosion at a crowded butcher shop. No group claimedresponsibility for that blast.   SWAPO has attacked both military and civilian targets during itssabotage and bombing campaign. An estimated 20,000 people have diedduring the bush war, about half of them guerrillas, about 700 ofthem security forces, and the rest civilians.   South African and South-West African troops have been fightingfor about five months in Angola on behalf of the UNITA rebelmovement. South African officials say they will not grantindependence to Namibia until after withdrawal of the 40,000 Cubantroops fighting in support of Angola's Marxist government.   Only about 70,000 of Namibia's 1.3 million people are white, andthe South African government has installed a multiracialtransitional administration to run the territory's affairs.   SWAPO has refused to negotiate with the transitional government,citing the U.N. resolution demanding free elections.   The South African Press Association said the doors of the bankmay have been locked at the time of the explosion. It said guardsoften locked the doors when the bank was busy in order to keep theoffice from becoming too crowded.</TEXT></DOC>
