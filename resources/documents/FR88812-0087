Box 5029, Southfield,Michigan 48086. The facility in New York for which this application isfiled is engaged in the manufacture of brake linings, including frictionmaterials containing asbestos.The applicant certifies that employees who would be affected by the variancehave been informed of the application by posting copies at all places wherenotices to employees are normally posted. Employees have also been informedof their right to petition the Assistant Secretary for a hearing. A copyof the application was given to the applicant's authorized employee representative.Regarding the merits of the application, the applicant contends that itis unable to come into full compliance with the engineering control requirementsof andSection; 1910.1001(f)(1) by July 20, 1988 primarily because unanticipatedgeological conditions have been encountered by the contractor excavatingfor the underground foundation and storage area within the factory buildingfor a sludge settling tank. The applicant has submitted an affidavit whichstates that the contractor has encountered rock formations that were notencountered in the test boring program, putting off the Applicant's compliancedate to October 20, 1988.The applicant contends that the engineering and work practice controlsselected in its attempt to come into compliance with the requirements ofandSection; 1910.1001(f)(1) of the Asbestos Standard will cost an estimated$2,900,000.00. The modifications include conversion of the current dryoperation to a wet process which is in an enclosed area and automated soas to reduce employee exposure to the manufacturing process. With the shiftto the wet process, a settling tank becomes a necessary component.The applicant states that the installation of the new system was scheduledto begin during the annual plant shutdown in July, with debugging completeby September. To comply with andSection; 1910.1001(o)(2)(viii) effectivedate of July 20, 1988, the applicant has also planned an inventory buildupduring the Spring of 1988 to carry it through the estimated mid-Augustcompletion date so that there would be no operation of the existing drymix line during the period from July 20, 1988 through the anticipated start-upof the new line by September 1, 1988.The applicant contends that the replacement of the existing dry-mix productionlines with an automated single process wet mix production line is a majorcomponent of its compliance program. The replacement requires the excavationfor and installation of a sludge tank to accommodate the new wet methodof recovering dust from cutting and grinding operations. The dimensionsof the tank are 44 feet by 15 feet and 12 feet deep. The actual excavationand foundation are, of course, even larger.The applicant says that the contractor has further advised that the 14-weekschedule cannot be shortened substantially in spite of the applicant'swillingness to authorize overtime and scheduling of a second shift, becauseit is unable to obtain the necessary laborers. The labor shortage is attributableto recent increases in construction work in the region.The applicant contends that, as a result of customer demand, it now appearsthat they must resume limited production operations with the existing drymix line during this period to supply its customers in the auto industryor there is the risk of shutting down automobile production lines at Fordand Chrysler resulting in economic and personal dislocation. To permitcontinued production, the applicant is therefore requesting an interimorder in addition to a temporary variance.The applicant states that during the period for which the variance andinterim order are being sought, it will continue to adhere to the existingcomprehensive asbestos control program, which is described in its applicationas ``Methods of Compliance Program,'' including the required housekeeping,respiratory protection program, medical surveillance, air sampling, employeetraining and continued designation of regulated areas.The applicant states that it will make every effort to achieve complianceas quickly as possible, including the addition of a second shift or useof additional overtime in the event its contractor can overcome the laborshortage which have, in part, resulted in this request for variance.<ITAG tagnum="84">Grant of Interim Order</ITAG>It appears from the application for a temporary variance and interim anorder that, as required by section 6(b)(6)(A) of the Act, the Bendix FrictionMaterials Division of the Automotive Sector of Allied-Signal Inc., Cohoesand Tibbits Avenue, Green Island (Troy), New York 12181 is unable to complywith the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.1001(o)(2)(viii) by the date requiredby the standard. It appears that the applicant is taking all availablesteps to safeguard its employees during the time needed to come into compliancewith the standard. It further appears that an interim order is necessaryto prevent undue hardship to the applicant and its employees pending adecision on the variance. Therefore, it is ordered, pursuant to the authorityin section 6(b)(6)(A) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970,in 29 CFR 1905.10(c) and in Secretary of Labor's Order No. 9-83 (48 FR35736), that the applicant shall continue to enforce the existing comprehensiveasbestos control program as described in its application. All other provisionsof the Asbestos Standard are unaffected by this order and therefore mustbe complied with in conjunction with the terms of this order.As soon as possible, the applicant shall give notice of this interim orderto affected employees by the same means required to be used to inform themof the application for a variance.This interim order shall remain in effect until October 20, 1988, or untila decision is rendered on the application for variance, whichever is theearlier.<ITAG tagnum="21">Signed at Washington, DC, this 8th day of August, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John A.
