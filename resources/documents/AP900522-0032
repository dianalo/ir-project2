The survey also found that 45 percent of senior citizens takemultiple prescription drugs, which can affect appetite orabsorption of nutrients.   Also, one out of four surveyed had a household income under$10,000 a year.   Yet, while about 85 percent said a healthy diet plays animportant role in preventing and recovering from illness, only 18percent said they worried a lot about a proper diet and more than athird said they don't worry at all.   The survey was released by the Nutrition Screening Initiative, afive-year project launched by a coalition of medical, health careand aging groups.   ``Nutrition is one of the important vital signs, just as bloodpressure or pulse,'' said Dr. Gerald Keller, an official of theAmerican Academy of Family Physicians, a leader of the coalition.   ``The fact is, however, America has not effectively incorporatedroutine nutrition screening and care into the nation's system ofhealth care delivery,'' he said.   The initiative will focus first on the elderly, who face adisproportionate nutritional risk for a variety of reasons.   Many live alone and tend not to cook, while others have reducedappetite and sense of taste, sometimes because of the medicationsthey take, said Paul Kerschner, senior vice president of theNational Council on the Aging.   The initiative will include efforts to educate health careprofessionals, administrators and policy makers about the need forproper nutrition, plus media campaigns aimed at the elderly andthose who care for them.   The survey was conducted by Peter Hart Research Associates Inc.A sample of 802 people over age 65 was polled by telephone Feb.7-16.</TEXT></DOC>
