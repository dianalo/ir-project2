Its underlying thesis is that the cruel choices thisprospect offers should be faced openly and public debate fostered. Itsummarizes the origins and the health risks of ozone, the current andprospective levels of control required to avoid them, the prospectivecontribution of transportation controls, and the information requiredto put the issue in a social benefits and social costs framework fordecision. It contrasts this approach with that found in the Clean AirAct and in the amendments to it now before Congress.</TEXT></DOC>
