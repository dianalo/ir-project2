The Labor Department said all of the non-farm payroll growthcame in the service-producing sector, with most of that coming asschools and local governments continued to add jobs for the schoolyear.   The department revised September payroll growth downward to201,000 from the previously reported 209,000.   The manufacturing sector, which lost a revised 88,000 jobs inSeptember, lost an additional 13,000 in October to post its fourthconsecutive monthly decline.   Underscoring the weakness in that sector was new data showingthe average manufacturing workweek fell from 41.8 hours to 40.8hours and overtime was virtually non-existent after averaging justunder four hours a week for several months. The automobilemanufacturing industry continued to struggle, losing 14,000 jobslast month.   The 233,000 jobs added to non-farm payrolls was more than mostanalysts had predicted and likely will give pause to FederalReserve policymakers who had been seen as leaning toward a furthereasing of credit, which in turn would lower interest rates.   Analysts said the report showed the economy continued to expand,although at a far slower pace than last year, and that the growthwas strong enough to prevent a further easing of credit by theFederal Reserve. The Fed policymakers meet Nov. 14 to discussmonetary policy.   ``The economy is clearly slowing down but once again there's norecession in these numbers,'' said Micheal Evans, head of aWashington forecasting firm. ``There is, however, continued sign ofaccelerating wages and the Fed is worried about that, so theycouldn't possibly ease as a result of this report.''   The Labor Department determines unemployment through a householdsurvey and its job-growth totals through a separate businesssurvey. The two surveys often give conflicting data on employmentgrowth and today the department said it had determined why _ moreAmericans are holding two or more jobs.   ``Most dual jobholders appear on two or more payrolls in thebusiness survey but are counted only once in the householdsurvey,'' Labor Statistics Commissioner Janet Norwood said intestimony she was giving Congress today. ``With the demand forlabor strengthening considerably in recent years, increasingnumbers of workers have taken on secnd jobs.''   Also up at a rate higher than predictions were average hourlyearnings, which rose 0.7 percent in October, a sign that upwardpressure on wages persists. Most analysts had predicted an increaseof 0.4 percent.   The October report showed that the civilian labor force grew by65,000 Americans last month to 124 million and that 117.5 millionof them had jobs. The labor force consists of those who either havejobs or are actively seeking work.   While the manufacturing workweek declined, the overall workweekin the private, non-farm sector edged up by 0.1 hour in October toa seasonally adjusted 34.8 hours. The department attributed most ofthe decline in manufacturing hours to the strike by Boeing workers.They were not counted as being off payrolls, however, because theirstrike began the same week the department took its monthly survey.   While local government payrolls expanded because of the schoolyear, job growth in the health-services sector continued its steadygrowth, adding 33,000 jobs in October. Job growth in businessservices was just 1,000; employment in finance, insurance and realestate was flat or up just slightly.   Retail trade added 24,000 jobs last month while transportationand public utilities added 27,000 jobs in October and wholesaletrade 6,000.   But in manufacturing and other goods-producing industries thenews was less encouraging.   Mining and construction posted modest gains, as did thenon-durable manufacturing sector. But the declining payrolls inauto plants and electrical and metal plants continued.   The unemployment rates among demographic groups changedsomewhat, with joblessness among white adult men falling from 4.8percent to 4.5 percent and rising among white adult women risingfrom 4.5 percent to 4.7 percent.   Overall teen-age unemployment fell from 15.1 to 14.9 percent, afigure influenced by the start of school.   Among black adult men, unemployment rose from 10 percent to 10.3percent. Joblessness among black adult women also rose, from 9.6percent to 10 percent.   Unemployment among black teens fell from 37.3 percent to 34.2percent and among Hispanics the rate dropped from 8.3 percent to7.9 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
