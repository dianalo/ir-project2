Gladys Hansen's last official day was Saturday, but the65-year-old plans to stay on by returning her first retirementcheck.   ``I won't retire if I feel this is all in jeopardy,'' she saidTuesday, gesturing to the collections she has helped amass over theyears. ``Unless I know who is going to take over and what is goingto happen to the collection and the staff, I won't retire.   City Librarian Kenneth Dowlin, who has been Hansen's boss forthree years, said, ``Gladys seems to be holding us hostage until wedo things her way.''   City law requires Dowlin, 49, to wait until Hansen's vacationtime and sick leave are expended before advertising for a newarchivist _ about six months from now.   He said he plans to lovingly care for the collection afterHansen is off the job, but probably will modernize, automate andexpand the archives.   ``She has been working for decades on that collection and feelsvery possessive about it, but she should be reminded it is nothers; it belongs to the city,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
