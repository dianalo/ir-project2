Law enforcement does not treat felons &quot;gingerly,&quot; as youimplied, but police believe we need laws to prevent crime,not simply take action after the crime. Every majorlaw-enforcement organization in America -- including theFraternal Order of Police, the International Association ofChiefs of Police, the National Sheriffs' Association and theNational Association of Police Organizations -- is urgingCongress to enact two federal gun statutes.</LP><TEXT>   Congress is considering legislation to stop the sale ofassault weapons such as the AK-47 used in the Stocktonmassacre and the Uzi assault pistol, favored by drugtraffickers. Assault weapons are like armor-piercingammunition, machine guns and undetectable plastic handguns.They aren't used by legitimate sportsmen, and shouldn't be onthe civilian market.   Such public-safety measures enjoy broad bipartisan supportin Congress. More and more politicians are beginning tolisten to those to whom we entrust our public safety -- thepolice -- and not the gun lobby.   Sarah Brady   Chair   Handgun Control Inc.   Washington   ---   Your editorial is demagogic nonsense. What does this poorwoman's experience have to do with gun control? If someonedies from a heroin overdose, are we to conclude that thereshould not be laws against selling crack cocaine? A barbaricact was committed with a pipe, a rock and a stick, but notall barbaric acts are committed with those weapons. In fact,each year in the U.S. about 9,200 murders -- nearly half ofall murders -- are committed with handguns, while only 6% ofall murders are committed with blunt instruments (includingpipes and rocks) and 6% with personal weapons (fists, feetand teeth).   Your editorial has waved a bloody shirt to inspire fearand fury and to turn those emotions subtly against anundeserving target. As ridiculous as it seems once exposed,it actually attempted to blame gun-control advocates for theattack on the jogger. The editorial's implication is thatgun-control advocates are somehow blocking more efficaciousanti-crime measures. Notwithstanding whatever stereotypeexists in your imagination, proponents of more rigorous guncontrol (who today include the organized law-enforcementcommunity) often favor many other public-safety measures. Onecan just as easily favor more rigorous gun control and morestringent sentencing of violent juveniles as one can favorprosecuting those who sell heroin and those who sell crackcocaine.   Carl T. Bogus   Member, Board of Directors   Center to Prevent Handgun Violence   Philadelphia   ---   Your editorial, in mentioning the verdict in the trial ofWashington Mayor Marion Barry, condoned what you perceived asthe jury's decision to craft a &quot;rough justice&quot; by not&quot;pil{ing} on&quot; convictions in its verdict. You went on to laudthis outcome as a &quot;common-sense&quot; effort on the jury's part tokeep Mr. Barry from running for re-election and stop him fromclaiming vindication.   I do not share your implicit view that these jurors didanything except their duty, which was to hear the evidence,determine the facts, and apply those facts to the law asinstructed by the court. By suggesting that they crafted arough justice based (at least in part) on political factors,you are necessarily assuming that they reached their verdictin dereliction of their obligations as jurors.   More distressing than your interpretation of the verdictis your approval of it based on that interpretation. If youare correct in your view that the jury had a politicalagenda, then the judicial system has broken down and Mr.Barry has not received a fair trial. If the evidence adducedat trial proved Mr. Barry's guilt beyond a reasonable doubton more than one count in the indictment, he should have beenconvicted on all of those counts. Conversely, he should nothave been convicted of any counts that were not borne out bythe facts. No other result comports with our Constitution orthe principles of modern democracy.   I recognize that sentences do not always reflect commonsense, and that they do not always seem just. This may beacutely true when trials involve public figures whose actionsare not only criminal but also offend their public trust.However, if we are unsatisfied with the sentences that accordwith the facts and the law as it is written, we must changethe law itself. We can fashion the law to reflect commonsense. But we cannot rely on an unspoken understanding thatjurors may abandon a court's instructions in favor of theirpolitical instincts whenever they perceive a need for &quot;roughjustice.&quot; Rough justice is not a high enough ideal for theAmerican judicial system.   Robert L. Ellman   Scottsdale, Ariz.   ---   Your editorial should be made mandatory reading for allhigh-school students. They are now the only ones who can stopthe rampage of criminal warriors, on the streets and ingovernment.   Our sick society has reaffirmed that crime, indeed, doespay. Until &quot;We the People&quot; start pushing for crime control,something the National Rifle Association has supported sinceits birth, we will have to live and die with the reality thatcriminals control our lives and destinies.   L. Alan Kudravy   Hawthorne, Calif.   ---   You are certainly right that there is no connectionbetween the jogger case and gun-control laws, so why did youtry to make one?   I haven't heard or seen any gun-control arguments thatclaim guns to be the only tools of violence, nor have I seenor heard any argument that guns are &quot;the {only} key to thecrime problem&quot; -- with one exception: The National RifleAssociation does claim that gun-control advocates say that,but they don't. Nor is there any claim that &quot;the crimeproblem can be {totally} solved&quot; by such laws.   Guns are often related to violence, but violence is quitepossible without guns. You are right.
