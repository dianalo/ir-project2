But that laid-back attitude is disappearing after the awards showwon the keys to the city in New York last year. Mayor Ed Koch saidhe would like the music folks back in the Big Apple at least everyother year.   ``What we tried to do was turn a one-night event into a four orfive evening event, to encourage people to come to the city,'' saidJonathan Tisch, chairman of the New York Host Committee for the 1988Grammy Awards.   ``There is a lot of prestige, but you certainly cannot ignore thefinancial aspect,'' said Tisch, president and chief executiveofficer of Loew's Hotels.   He estimated Grammy visitors and the television show broughtabout $40 million to the city.   ``There were some very interesting and culturally liftingmoments, and that was one of the things that New York reallyprovided. It makes the nominees feel really special,'' Greene saidrecently.   For the first time, Los Angeles has countered New York'shospitality with its own friendship campaign, consisting of severalevents revolving around Wednesday's awards ceremony.   This year's three-hour awards show will be broadcast live on CBSbeginning at 8 p.m. EST. Top nominees include folk singer TracyChapman with six nominations and jazz vocalist Bobby McFerrin withfive. The show's host will be comedian Billy Crystal.   The awards are voted by the Los Angeles-based academy's 6,000members for the best musical performances and songwriting. This isthe 31st year for the awards, and the show has been held in LosAngeles every year except five.   This year, the Los Angeles Welcomes The Grammy Awards Committee,a panel of business leaders selected by Mayor Tom Bradley, isoverseeing receptions and making sure the Grammy folks are welcomein Los Angeles.   It's the same formula used by Bradley to attract the Olympics toLos Angeles in 1984.   ``What we see is a foundation for building a longer-termrelationship,'' said James L. Stewart, executive director of theGrammy committee, which has raised $200,000 from businesses to payseveral events.   Stewart said the academy's directors decide where to hold theawards ceremony, and none of the possible host cities have a chanceto make bids.   The committee's events included a Grammys In The Schools programheld Friday at Hamilton High School, where a music academy attractsstudents from all over the 300-square-mile Los Angeles schooldistrict. Performers included composer-conductor Henry Mancini, jazzdrummer Stix Hooper and ``Tonight Show'' saxophonist PeterChristlieb.   A Grammy Night On The Town on Sunday showcased jazz in the Cityof Angels, with performances throughout the city by Benny Carter andhis trio, trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie, singer Billy Eckstine, and ArtBlakey and the Jazz Messengers.   During a gala reception Monday at the Gene Autry Western HeritageMuseum, the music academy's President's Award was given to Autry.   Stewart said the host committee, representing the city but notfunded by it, made political sense.   ``An activity like the committee ... most people would notconsider that to be an appropriate public funds expenditure,'' hesaid. ``But bringing together the civic leadership of this city todo something like this is highly appropriate.''   No matter what Los Angeles does to make the Grammy guests andshow feel welcome in the city, Greene has made it clear he isambivalent about where the show should be held.   ``As far as the show itself, Los Angeles and New York are eachcenters of music, centers of culture,'' Greene said. ``We don't havea problem booking the show at either location.''</TEXT></DOC>
