The 101-member movement was formed in Yugoslavia in 1961, withPresident Tito as a founder, to offer an alternative to the powerblocs led by the United States and Soviet Union. The next summit isscheduled for September in Yugoslavia.   Discussions at the three-day meeting to set the summit agendaare expected to focus on Third World conflicts, mounting foreigndebt, South African racial policies, superpower efforts on armsreduction and the PLO declaration of an independent Palestinianstate.   It was scheduled as a meeting of foreign ministers butconference sources said no more than 30 were expected to attend,which strengthened the argument by critics that the organizationlacks relevance to international politics.   President Robert Mugabe is chairman of the non-aligned movement.   Those who say the movement no longer has a role note that thesuperpowers, not the non-aligned nations, were responsible forrecent easing of crises in the Third World: withdrawal of Sovietforces from Afghanistan and a regional peace pact promisingNamibian independence from South Africa.   A committee was formed last year to determine why the movementseems to be stagnating. Its findings and recommendations have notbeen revealed.   An Asian delegate told The Associated Press: ``There's too muchrhetoric and not enough action. The Soviet bloc and the West blocget things done without too much talk.''   Draft recommendations for the foreign ministers and otherdelegates to consider include:   _ Promoting a ban on nuclear weapons tests.   _ Condemning South Africa for acquiring a nuclear weaponscapability with the alleged help of Western powers and Israel.   _ Denouncing the West for supporting South Africadiplomatically, economically and militarily.   _ Supporting a broad-based government in Afghanistan.   _ Backing for efforts toward international peace talks on theMiddle East.   _ Supporting the Palestine Liberation Organization declarationof an independent state.   _ Criticizing the United States for ``destabilizing actions andcoercive economic measures'' against Panama.   Among the first issues up for consideration is a disagreement inLatin America about efforts by Panama to prevent admission ofVenezuela as a member.   Panama's delegation accused Venezuela of plotting to overthrowits government. No details were revealed of the alleged plotagainst Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, Panama's de facto ruler, whocommands the military and police.   Last week, Panama said President Carlos Andres Perez ofVenezuela had been in touch with Panamanian army officers urgingthem to overthrow Noriega.   The movement's coordinating bureau, meeting in New York inMarch, recommended that Venezuela be admitted. A Venezuelandelegation is expected to attend the Harare meeting.</TEXT></DOC>
