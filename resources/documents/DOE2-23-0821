To assess the possibility of waterborneasbestos becoming airborne, air samples were collected from impactedhouses receiving contaminated water from three control houses. Collectedwithin each house were three samples on 0.6-micrometer-pore Nucleporefilters and three samples on 0.8-micrometer-pore Millipore filters. Inaddition, bulk samples of suspect material and water samples were collected.Mean waterborne asbestos concentrations were 24 million fibers per liter(MFL) in the impacted houses versus only 1.1 MFL in the control houses.Transmission electron microscopy revealed that airborne asbestos concentrationswere highest in impacted houses, with airborne asbestos concentrationspositively correlated with waterborne concentrations. For fiber and massmeasurements on both filter types, airborne asbestos concentrations weresignificantly higher in the impacted houses: mean concentrations in impactedhouses were 0.12 fibers/cm3 and 1.7 ng/m3 on Nuclepore filters and 0.053fibers/cm3 and 2.3 ng/m3 on Millipore filters versus only 0.037 fibers/cm3and 0.31 ng/m3 on Nuclepore filters and 0.0077 fibers/cm3 and 0.14 ng/m3on Millipore filters from control houses. Also detected in the air samplesfrom impacted houses were clusters of chrysotile, often with severalhundreds of fibers. When estimates of these individual fibers were addedto the total fiber count, the difference between the impacted and controlhouses became even greater. The increased concentrations in impactedhouses were due primarily to short (less than 1 micrometer) fibers. Bulksamples did not reveal likely materials within the impacted houses toaccount for these differences. Thus high levels of waterborne asbestoswere apparently the source of increased concentrations of airborne asbestoswithin these houses.</TEXT></DOC>
