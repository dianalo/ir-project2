In a speech, Energy Secretary James Watkins provided a blueprint for the initial phase, acknowledging that even an optimistic timetable &quot;passes much of the burden to the next generation.&quot;    After a top-level review of the shortcomings in environmental-protection and health-protection measures at the government nuclear facilities, the department said it proposes to spend $2.4 billion in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1 to help correct the shortcomings. After that, the annual bill is expected to increase steadily, peaking at more than $4 billion in both fiscal 1994 and 1995. For the entire cleanup effort, which will stretch well into the next century, the cost has been estimated at anywhere from $90 billion to $150 billion.    The money, which must still be approved by Congress, would be used to clean up pollution where federal and state safety laws are violated, repair faulty equipment and develop new procedures and technology for future waste disposal, the department said.    The plan commits the department to develop a cleanup priority list, containing known contamination and assessing the extent of yet-unknown hazards. The department also said it will release health records of workers at weapons facilities for scientific evaluation to determine the extent of risk.    Most of the $19.5 billion will be used at 17 nuclear-weapons plants in a dozen states, but some funds would be allocated for cleanup efforts at more than 70 other government nuclear facilities, most of which have long been closed, officials said.    Among the sites considered to be heavily contaminated are the Rocky Flat plutonium-processing plant in Colorado; the Savannah River weapons plant in South Carolina; the Fernald uranium processing plant in Ohio; the Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee; the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near Idaho Falls; and the Hanford Reservation in eastern Washington state. </TEXT></DOC>
