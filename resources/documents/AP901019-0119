Gorbachev'semissary to Iraq met with President Bush today and stressed hopesthat the Persian Gulf crisis can be settled without war. Bushagreed, but made clear there can be no compromise rewarding Iraq,and that military force remains an alternative.   ``I believe we should not rule out the possibilities of peacefulsolution util we have exhausted all options,'' Yevgeny Primakovtold reporters as he left the White House.   Before the meeting, Bush vowed anew that Iraq's aggression andtakeover of Kuwait will ``not be rewarded by some compromise.''Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said he emphasized during thesession that ``the international focus is the use of sanctions anddiplomacy to accomplish the peaceful withdrawal of Iraq fromKuwait, but that the international community is prepared toconsider alternative options.''   Primakov, who visited Baghdad two weeks ago, conferred with Bushin the Oval Office. The president was joined by Secretary of StateJames A. Baker III, National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, andScowcroft's deputy, Robert Gates.   The Soviet official said it would be ``assuming too much'' tothink that today's meeting had brought the crisis closer to an end.   Primakov said he agreed with Bush that the nations of the worldshould not relax their insistence on an Iraqi withdrawal fromKuwait.   ``One cannot allow a situation where actions which areincompatible with a civilized society would be in order,'' Primakovsaid through a translator.   He said that Bush ``also believes and thinks that all theobjectives that have been set must be accomplished throughcomplying and implementing United Nations resolutions. In this, ourpositions are the same.''   Asked if he were hopeful that a peaceful settlement could beachieved, Primakov replied, ``I cannot say that I have become lessmoderately optimistic that I used to be before.''   Primakov was asked earlier if he were bringing a message fromSaddam about possible steps to defuse the Persian Gulf crisis.   ``No message from Saddam Hussein because I am not a messenger,''Primakov said. Asked if he were carrying a message from Gorbachev,Primakov replied curtly: ``Best regards.''   Bush turned aside questions about the session. However, in ameeting earlier with Italian-American leaders, Bush said he sees nochance for compromise in the gulf crisis, as has been suggested insome diplomatic quarters.   ``I am as determined as I was the day the first troop left, thatSaddam Hussein's aggression not be rewarded by some compromise, notbe rewarded by failing to get him totally out of Kuwait or restorethe legitimate rulers ... The bottom line is he can't prevail.''   Primakov came to the White House with assurances of solidKremlin support for tougher international sanctions aimed atforcing Iraq out of Kuwait.   U.S. officials said Primakov stressed that Moscow wants to keepworking through the United Nations to reverse the Aug. 2 invasionwith political and diplomatic measures. Primakov stopped in Romeand Paris this week on his way to Washington.   Among the new steps under consideration are demandingreparations from Iraq for what Baker calls ``the rape of Kuwait''and possibly an international trial of President Saddam Hussein asa war criminal.   The U.N. Security Council has banned virtually all trade withIraq, but after more than two months of occupying Kuwait the Iraqileader has not bowed to the pressure.   Primakov gave no indication in his talks with Italian and Frenchofficials, or in his meeting Thursday with Baker, that Gorbachevhas an alternative formula to end the Persian Gulf standoff, theU.S. officials said before today's White House meeting.   Primakov presented nothing new to Baker and Dennis B. Ross, headof the State Department's policy planning staff, ``nothing they hadnot heard before,'' said an official who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   ``I haven't heard about an Iraqi plan or a Gorbachev plan,'' theofficial told The Associated Press. ``There is nothing here thatsent people down the aisles saying this is something new.''   The official referred to published reports that Primakov wascarrying a Gorbachev plan or one from Baghdad, where he met withIraqi leaders two weeks ago.   After seeing Baker on Thursday, the Soviet envoy ruled out anydeal with Saddam that would reward the Iraqi leader for pullingtroops out of Kuwait.   ``We should look for some possibilities to avoid, from my pointof view, the military clashes, but not reward Iraq, of course, withits actions,'' Primakov said in halting English before climbinginto a waiting black limousine.</TEXT></DOC>
