William Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said it's unclear whether a pivotal arms-control interpretation being pushed by Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger is legally correct.    The interpretation -- which would broaden the Pentagon's ability to test space weapons under the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty -- involves &quot;very complex&quot; legal questions, Adm. Crowe said at a meeting with reporters. &quot;The legal analysis isn't complete yet,&quot; he added.    Secretary Weinberger and others at the Pentagon have been pushing the broader interpretation as the proper reading of the treaty, which sharply limits testing and deployment of antimissile systems. Indeed, those pushing the new interpretation have dubbed it LCI, for &quot;legally correct interpretation.&quot;    On another matter, when asked about U.S. support for the Nicaraguan rebels, Adm. Crowe wouldn't go as far as some of the Contras' supporters within the administration, who have called for the overthrow of the Sandinista regime in Managua. He said that the goal in supporting the rebels was to &quot;protect our gains&quot; in stabilizing democracies in neighboring states, and to push the Nicaraguan government toward a more democratic approach.    He also indicated that the American public wouldn't indefinitely support aid for the Contras without some signs of success.    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater appeared to take issue with Adm. Crowe's comments yesterday. &quot;The U.S. commitment to the Contras is fixed and steadfast,&quot; Mr. Fitzwater said.    On the issue of weapons testing, Adm. Crowe agreed with Mr. Weinberger that the broader interpretation would benefit the president's Strategic Defense Initiative by allowing more realistic tests of antimissile systems. However, members of Congress and European allies have expressed worries that the broader interpretation would erode the arms treaty or even hinder arms control efforts in general.    Adm. Crowe stressed that the Reagan administration currently is consulting with congressional leaders and allies on the matter.    The new interpretation, which surfaced last year, maintains that the two superpowers can conduct full tests of weapons based on physical principles that weren't known in 1972, when the pact was signed.    Although the more permissive interpretation of the treaty would allow a broader range of tests, it wouldn't necessarily accelerate the development of weapon systems that Pentagon officials consider the most likely candidates to be deployed soon. These systems, mostly high-speed missile interceptors based in space or on the ground, are largely derived from technologies that existed in 1972.    Currently, all of the SDI office's experiments have been designed to comply with the narrower interpretation. As he has been pushing for a broader interpretation, Mr. Weinberger has asked the office to prepare a report that sets out new experiments or changes in already planned experiments to reflect a more permissive reading.    And in another clash of views within the Reagan administration, the State Department yesterday differed with arms-control director Kenneth Adelman, who had said U.S. allies didn't &quot;have any qualifications&quot; for telling Washington how to interpret the ABM Treaty.    Meanwhile, a State Department spokesman stated that the Reagan administration has made &quot;a serious commitment to consult&quot; its allies on the matter. </TEXT></DOC>
