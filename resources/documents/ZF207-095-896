 In their new roles as Mips RISClicensees, NEC and Siemens join the ranks of LSI Logic, Integrated DeviceTechnology and Performance Semiconductor.andM;With the completion of its second-sourcing arrangements, Mips is finally in aposition to establish its RISC architecture as the dominant global standardfor high-performance computing platforms, according to Robert Miller, Mips'chairman, president and chief executive officer.andM;By adding NEC and Siemens to its stable of second-source producers, Mips hasconstructed &quot;a new model for market share leadership in the '90s,&quot; Millersaid.andM;&quot;Together, we will establish a global microprocessor architecture that willbe based on Mips technology for the next decade and beyond,&quot; he said.andM;Miller said the strategy to expand its manufacturing base for the RISC chipswas the result of pressure from large customers such as DEC, Silicon Graphicsand Sony.andM;DEC uses the Mips R2000 chip set in its DECstation 3100.andM;At the press conference, Miller named Sony as the latest major customer toadopt the Mips chip set.andP;  But Miller's staff later said they had no detailson the apparent decision by the Japanese electronics giant to incorporateMips' architecture in new workstation products.andP;  The source of the Sony rumorwas a &quot;leak&quot; that appeared in Japanese newspapers last week, a Mipsspokeswoman said.andM;DEC played an instrumental role in enlisting NEC and Siemens to license theRISC architecture, Miller said.andP;  However, Miller said, DEC's decision lastfall to use Mips' RISC technology in a new generation of workstations was notpredicated on whether Mips succeeded in adding NEC and Siemens to its stableof manufacturers.andM;&quot;DEC cut the deal with us before we even had [the NEC and Siemens contracts]in the offing,&quot; Miller said.andM;Robert Palmer, DEC's vice president of semiconductor operations, stressed theimportance his company places on Mips' establishment of a broad network ofsuppliers.andM;&quot;Mips' semiconductor product approach levels the playing field and broadensboth the market and the customer options,&quot; Palmer said.andM;According to Miller, customers such as DEC not only demanded multiplesuppliers, but they also wanted to be able to buy the chips from world-classsemiconductor vendors.andP;  Instead of gambling their future product lines on thestability of &quot;a small company in Silicon Valley,&quot; they wanted the assurancethat dominant silicon producers were committed to producing a full array ofMips-based products, he said.andP;  &quot;Our customers told us that the majorsuppliers were not providing RISC.&quot;andM;&quot;They wanted full-line suppliers who could meet their needs not only formicroprocessors, but for a broad range of products--from price-sensitive andsupply-constrained DRAMs to specialized components like ASICs,&quot; Miller said.andM;NEC and Siemens representatives at the Mips press conference assured systemmakers that they intend to fulfill the demand for one-stop RISC shopping.andM;Hajime Sasaki, vice president and director of NEC's Semiconductor Group, saidthe company will start production of the Mips R2000A and R3000 chip setsduring the next quarter.andM;NEC also plans to offer a CMOS implementation of the RISC technology duringthe third quarter of 1989 and an ECL version of the Mips R3000 during thefirst half of 1990.andM;Horst Fischer, vice president of the Siemens' Munich-based semiconductordivision, announced plans for a &quot;globally supported family of RISCprocessors, derivatives and cores, all based on the Mips architecture.&quot;andO;Shipments are set to begin in the fourth quarter of this year, according tothe company.andM;The undisclosed royalty payments also give the semiconductor manufacturers alicense to publish Mips' complete software package, including compilers andall support software.andM;The success of the RISC architecture can be charted by the growing number ofapplications available for it, according to Miller.andP;  In part through theefforts of Synthesis Software Solutions--an &quot;independent&quot; software house ofwhich Mips owns 51 percent--there are currently about 1,000 softwareapplications that are ported to the RISC architecture running over Unix,Miller said.andM;Miller said he expects NEC's and Siemens' participation in the RISC market toact as a catalyst for further growth.andP;  The addition of the two high-volumemanufacturers should more than triple the number of chip set shipments withina year, according to Mips' estimates.andM;About 150,000 units were shipped last year, and that number will jump toabout 500,000 units by year's end, according to Chet Silvestri, Mips' vicepresident of marketing.andM;Greater availability will inevitably bring down costs as well, Miller said.andO;He predicted that basic RISC chip sets, such as those used for embeddedcontrollers, could come down to about $10 each as a result of the productionincreases.andM;The effect on prices of RISC-based workstations could be even more dramatic.andO;Miller said a RISC workstation could become available for less than $5,000 by1991, &quot;if not sooner.&quot;andM;One-Way Flow?andM;Both Siemens and NEC described themselves as &quot;technology partners&quot; with Mipsin the licensing scheme, but the initial stages of the agreement appear toset up a one-way flow of technology from Mips to its manufacturers.andP;  Millerstated, however, that Mips plans to work closely with engineers at thesemiconductor houses and eventually to incorporate their technologicaladvances into the Mips product line.andM;&quot;CMOS technology is a good example of that,&quot; Miller said.andM;Prem Talreja, Siemens' marketing manager for microprocessors, peripherals,and integrated circuits, said he did not expect the manufacturers to offerimprovements to the Mips architecture in the near future.andM;&quot;I think it will be a while before the semiconductor companies can contributeto the technology,&quot; Talreja said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
