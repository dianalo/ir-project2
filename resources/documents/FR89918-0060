Background </ITAG>A. Goals of the Administration on Developmental Disabilities The Administration on Developmental Disabilities (ADD) is located withinthe Office of Human Development Services (HDS), Department of Health andHuman Services. Although different from the other HDS program administrationsin the specific populations it serves, ADD shares a common mission: toreduce dependency and increase self-sufficiency among our most vulnerablecitizens. Emphasis on this mission, and progress toward it will help morepersons with developmental disabilities live productive and independentlives, integrated into communities. We have left an era when the trend was to assign to the Federal governmentan ever increasing responsibility for identifying the needs for socialservices and for designing programs to meet those needs. Public policynow articulates that public decisions are best made at the level of governmentclosest to the target populations served_by elected State and local officials,and by those who manage programs at the State and local levels, includinggovernment officials, private organizations, voluntary organizations, schools,or religious organizations. Therefore, ADD has adopted specific goals whichreflect this policy position. These goals are: andbullet; To increase family and individual self-sufficiency and independencethrough social and economic development strategies; andbullet; To target Federal assistance to the most severely disabled; andandbullet; To improve the effectiveness and efficiency of State and locallyadministered human services programs.B. Purpose of the Administration on Developmental Disabilities The overall purpose of the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Billof Rights Act (the Act) is to provide assistance to States and public andprivate non-profit agencies and organizations to ensure that all personswith developmental disabilities can receive the services and other assistanceand opportunities necessary to enable such persons to achieve their maximumpotential through increased independence, productivity and integrationinto the community. The Act emphasizes that persons with developmentaldisabilities include those with severe functional limitations attributableto physical impairments, mental impairments, and combinations of physicaland mental impairments. In addition, in administering the Act at the Federal level, ADD seeks toenhance the role of the family in assisting persons with developmentaldisabilities to achieve their maximum potential as well as ensuring theprotection of the legal and human rights of persons with developmentaldisabilities. programs funded under the Act are: andbullet; Basic State formula grants; andbullet; State system for protection and advocacy of individual rights;andbullet; Grants to University Affiliated Programs for interdisciplinarytraining, exemplary services/technical assistance and information dissemination;and andbullet; Grants for Projects of National Significance. C. Descriptions of Projects of National Significance Under part E of the Act, grants and contracts are awarded for projectsof national significance to increase and support the independence, productivity,and integration into the community of persons with developmental disabilities.These projects may include but are not limited to: andbullet; Projects to educate policymakers; andbullet; Projects to develop an ongoing data collection system; andbullet; Projects to pursue Federal interagency initiatives; and andbullet; Other projects of sufficient size and scope which hold promiseof expanding or otherwise improving opportunities for persons with developmentaldisabilities (especially those who are multi-handicapped or disadvantaged,or minority groups, including Native Americans, Native Hawaiians, and otherunderserved groups). In addition, funds may be awarded for technical assistance and demonstrationprojects (including research, training, and evaluation in connection withsuch projects) which hold promise of expanding or otherwise improving theadvocacy functions performed by State Developmental Disabilities PlanningCouncils, the functions performed by University Affiliated Programs andSatellite Centers, and the State Protection and Advocacy System. Projectsfor the evaluation and assessment of the quality of services provided personswith developmental disabilities are also authorized to be funded.Section 162(c) of the Act requires that ADD publish in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, not later than January 1 of each year, proposedpriorities for grants and contracts to carry out Projects of National Significancein the upcoming fiscal year. The Act also requires a period of 60 daysfor public comment and suggestions. After analyzing and considering suchcomments, ADD must publish in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> the final priorities for such grants and contracts,and solicit applications for funding based on the final priorities selected.The following section presents the proposed priority areas for Fiscal Year1990 Projects of National Significance.
