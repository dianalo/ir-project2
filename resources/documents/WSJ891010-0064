It said Georgia Power sought the increase to recover its investment in Unit 2 of its Vogtle Nuclear Power plant and other costs of providing service.    The Atlanta company said it will receive $75 million of the increase during the first year, which began last Tuesday, and the remainder -- some $143 million -- over the next 10 years.    The company said it is considering whether to ask the Georgia Public Service Commission to reconsider its decision. </TEXT></DOC>
