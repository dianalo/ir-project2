But the bumblebee doesn't know that. So I keptgoing forward.''   Today, the 47-year-old has realized something of a fairy tale inmusical annals. An untrained rank outsider, he has conductedMahler's Second, ``The Resurrection,'' 13 times around the world andhas just released a recording.   The Austrian composer wrote eight other symphonies, but Kaplanhas no interest in conducting them. He's sticking with the SecondSymphony.   ``I certainly feel qualified to learn other things but I don'tthink of myself as a conductor,'' he says.   Kaplan, who gave his first performance in 1982 with the AmericanSymphony Orchestra, can't read music and has memorized the score.Some critics have accused him of using his wealth to indulgehimself, while others have praised him.   Married with four children, he publishes the magazineInstitutional Investor and conducts for free. He hopes to performthe symphony next year in Japan, West Germany, Denmark, Venezuelaand Jerusalem.   When Kaplan conducted with the London Symphony Orchestra in 1986and sold out London's 6,000-seat Royal Albert Hall, Michael Kennedyof the Daily Telegraph called his interpretation ``revealing andmoving.''   ``This is no rich man's acted-out fantasy,'' he wrote. ``The LSOdo not play with this kind of subtlety in the matter of dynamics norwith such careful instrumental balance unless the man with the stickhas got his message across.''   Kaplan was in London in November for the release of his recordingwith the LSO in Cardiff, Wales. He talked about his ``hobby,'' as hesat in his Savoy Hotel suite overlooking the Thames and the RoyalFestival Hall where he conducted in 1984.   ``I used to look across to the Festival Hall but I never thoughtI would ever conduct there,'' he said.   Kaplan studied music from age 7 to 10 ``like other American boys,and I stopped as soon as I could.''   In 1965, he was working on Wall Street when a friend took him tohear conductor Leopold Stokowski rehearsing Mahler's Second with theAmerican Symphony Orchestra at Carnegie Hall.   Kaplan was sufficiently intrigued to go to the concert. ``I hadnever heard Mahler's music before and when I walked out of the hallI was a different person,'' he recalled.   ``The first time you hear Mozart's music, you think it ischarming. The first time you hear Mahler's _ if Mahler can reach you_ you are changed in a very fundamental way. Even poor performancesproduce enthusiastic audiences and when I turn around, I can alwaysspot the people who are hearing it for the first time.   ``Mahler, more than any other composer, touches on very personalmatters which, as children, we think about and then we tuck away andforget, to get on with our lives.   ``Then Mahler pushes the buttons again and everything comes back_ life, death, hope, despair, purpose _ all those things grownupsdon't talk about.''   Over the next 15 years, Kaplan heard every performance of theSecond Symphony in New York.   ``Then I woke up one morning, and somehow I knew that one day Iwas going to conduct a symphony. I know it sounds preposterous,'' hesaid.   ``I didn't know what it meant to conduct, didn't know thatMahler's Second is one of the most difficult works to conduct. Iwasn't trying to prove anything. I wasn't climbing mountains and itwasn't a mid-life crisis. I just knew I was going to conduct thesymphony. I was on a conveyor belt and no way of getting off.''   As a member of the board of Carnegie Hall, he was able to getadvice from musicians and conductors. He talked to more people, readand got nowhere.   Then Kaplan found a young conductor, Charles Bornstein of theJuilliard School in New York, took him to his Long Island home andworked nine hours a day for 30 days, memorizing an 83-minutesymphony.   The rest is history. The New York Daily News rated Kaplan's 1983performance with the American Symphony Orchestra among the year's 10best. Other orchestras invited him to conduct and critics havepraised his performances from Brazil to Japan.   Mahler, who died in Vienna in 1911 at age 50, was a zealousperfectionist whose musicians at the Vienna Opera called him ``thetyrant.''   Kaplan, who owns Mahler's original score, says: ``He was a greatnotationist and could write down what he really wanted from themusicians. ... He tells you, `Don't slow down here,' because heknows the music has a tendency to slow down there.   ``I try to conduct the music as closely as possible to whatMahler wanted. I want people to hear what Mahler wrote, notsomeone's idea of what he wrote.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions, Dec 30-Jan. 1</NOTE></DOC>
