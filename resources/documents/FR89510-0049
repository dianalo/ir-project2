(Services),also an Illinois corporation, with its principal office in Wheeling, Illinois.Services and its subsidiaries are engaged in the development, ownership,operation and maintenance of cogeneration projects. Indeck-Yerkes is currentlyconstructing a new 53-megawatt gas-fired cogeneration facility adjacentto the DuPont-Yerkes plant near Tonawanda, New York. The cogenerator isexpected to be completed and in commercial operation by March 1, 1990.It will be operated as a ``qualifying facility'' under section 201 of thePublic Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978. In addition, Indeck-Yerkeshas filed a Certification of Compliance with the coal capability requirementfor proposed new electric powerplants pursuant to the Powerplant and IndustrialFuel Use Act of 1978, as amended (54 FR 3111, January 23, 1989).Indeck-Yerkes states that all the natural gas imported under its requestedauthorization will be used to fuel the new cogeneration facility. Underanticipated normal operating conditions, the cogenerating facility willconsume an average of about 12,000 Mcf per day. Indeck-Yerkes asserts thatits request for authority to import up to 4.5 Bcf per year is necessaryto meet the facility's fuel needs, allow for transportation shrinkage,and provide a reasonable margin for any unforeseen exigency. The electricpower to be produced by the facility is under contract for sale to NiagaraMohawk Power Corporation.Indeck-Yerkes will buy the Canadian gas from Indeck Gas Supply Corporation(Supply), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Services, in accordance with theirgas purchase agreement dated December 27, 1988. Supply has agreed to selland deliver up to a maximum of 14 MMcf of gas per day and up to an annualcontract quantity of 4.5 Bcf. The price will equal Supply's weighted averagecost of the gas delivered to Indeck-Yerkes, including a management feedescribed below, and all costs related to transportation in Canada by NOVACorporation of Alberta and TransCanada PipeLines Limited (TCPL) to thepoint at the international border where Indeck-Yerkes receives the volumes.The term of the agreement between Indeck-Yerkes and Supply extends throughJanuary 1, 2006, with provision for extension for subsequent periods ofone year, until terminated by a 12-month notice in writing by either party.Indeck-Yerkes estimates that the delivered price it will pay Supply duringthe first year of the proposed import arrangement would be $2.52 per Mcf.Indeck-Yerkes bases this estimate on its calculation of Supply's weightedaverage cost of gas per Mcf purchased from producers under four contractssubmitted as part of this application.The volumes of gas that Supply has available for resale to Indect-Yerkeswill be provided by Northstar Energy Corporation (Northstar), ChesapeakeResources Ltd., <T3>et al.</T3> (Chesapeake, <T3>et al.</T3>), and Bow Valley Industries, Ltd. (Bow Valley). Together,those Canadian producers contractually agreed to sell to Supply, on a firmbasis, a total of up to 25.8 MMcf per day and up to 9.34 Bcf of naturalgas per year as well as up to .33 Bcf of natural gas per year on an interruptiblebasis. According to the application, after TCPL's transportation shrinkageallowance, estimated to be approximately 7 percent, these volumes net Supplya total of 9.0 Bcf per year or up to 24.0 MMcf per day for export at theinternational border. Of the total volumes purchased by Supply from theproducers, 4.5 Bcf per year or 12.0 MMcf per day will be sold to Indeck-Yerkes.The remaining 4.5 Bcf purchased annually will be sold by Supply to Indeck-Yerkes'affiliate, Indeck Energy Services of Oswego, Inc. (Indeck-Oswego), to fuela cogeneration facility it is planning to build near Oswego, New York.Indeck-Oswego has an application for authority to import that gas fromSupply pending before the DOE in FE Docket No. 89-22-NG.Indeck-Yerkes states that the four contracts encompassing the entire quantityof gas purchased by Supply will be administered by a single producer, BowValley. Bow Valley will also act as Supply's liaison with TCPL for thetransportation of Supply's gas through TCPL's system. For this service,Bow Valley will receive a fee from Supply of approximately $0.02 (U.S.)per Mcf of purchased gas which will be included in the price of gas paidby Indeck-Yerkes.Indeck-Yerkes described Supply's gas purchase agreements with the Canadianproducers as follows:<ITAG tagnum="84">A. Northstar Agreement</ITAG>Under the Northstar gas purchase agreement, Supply will purchase with alump sum payment in the amount of $13.65 million (U.S.) to be paid on November1, 1989, a total volume of 26 million MMBtu (approximately 26 Bcf) of naturalgas to be delivered over a maximum term of 18 years. Additionally, Supplywill reimburse Northstar for its actual production taxes, and gatheringand processing costs based on an initial rate of $.315 (U.S.) per MMBtu.This initial rate is to be increased annually by an amount equal to thegreater of five percent of the U.S. GNP deflator commencing on January1, 1989. Supply will reimburse Northstar for all related royalty paymentsand all transportation costs to the point of delivery near Empress, Alberta.Supply also agreed to a minimum take of at least 6,000 MMBtu of gas perday and contends that it is highly unlikely that Supply will be unableto take at least that amount at any time during the term because the averagecombined daily requirements of the two cogeneration facilities consumingthis gas is estimated to total 24,000 Mcf per day.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Chesapeake, et al., Agreement</ITAG>The Chesapeake group of producers have agreed to sell Supply a total ofup to 7,078 Mcf per day of natural gas over an initial term of 15 years.Additional non-firm volumes may be purchased if needed in any year. Underthe Chesapeake agreement, Supply will take title to the gas delivered tothe Alberta border at an initial price of $1.67 (U.S.) per Mcf. CommencingJanuary 1, 1991, and each year thereafter, the contract price will escalateby three percent of the preceding contract year price. Supply also agreedto pay an annual bonus set by a formula essentially fixing the price ofthe gas, subject to ceiling amounts, to the price received by Indeck-Yerkes'affiliate, Indeck-Oswego, for electric power sold to Niagara Mohawk fromits Oswego, New York, cogeneration facility. The bonus payments would startin 1992, when the maximum bonus payment would be $.12 per Mcf and couldgradually rise to a maximum of $3.75 per Mcf in 2004 as the price paidfor the electric power exceeds the specified floor rate which increasesbeginning in 1998.The Chesapeake contract volumes will be produced from dedicated reservesthat are to be verified annually by an independent engineering firm. Further,in the event the firm sales volumes are not delivered, Supply's agreementprovides that the Chesapeake producers must reimburse Supply for the reasonablecost of securing substitute production from other sources.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Bow Valley Agreements</ITAG>Supply has two contracts with Bow Valley under which Bow Valley will sellSupply, on a firm basis, a combined total of up to 12,500 Ncf of Canadiannatural gas per day for an initial term of 15 years. The contracts aredated February 13, and March 13, 1989, respectively. Supply has agreedto take or pay for a total of 4.56 Bcf of gas per year, but is given theright to receive any prepaid volumes at any time up to two years afterthe end of the term of the agreements. Supply will take title to the gasat a point of interconnection between Bow Valley's TCPL's transmissionfacilities located in Saskatchewan. The pricing provisions of Bow Valley'sFebruary agreement are identical to those of the Chesapeake agreement.The initial price will be $1.67 (U.S.) per Mcf and escalates each yearby three percent, plus a bonus to be determined under the same formulacontained in the Chesapeake contract. The March agreement provides forthe same $1.67 price and bonus formula, but provides for a four percentannual escalation to the initial price. Bow Valley has agreed to pay forthe transportation to its interconnection with TCPL and any Canadian taxes,royalties and duties assessed on the delivered gas. Bow Valley will guaranteedelivery of at least 12,500 Mcf per day from its own reserves and has agreedto secure substitute production from other sources in the event it incursa production problem or for some other reason cannot deliver the contractvolume as agreed. The point of delivery for the gas imported by Indeck-Yerkes to enter theU.S. will be at an interconnection between TCPL and a new border facilitynear and parallel to the existing facilities of Tennessee Gas PipelineCompany (Tennessee) in the vicinity of Niagara Falls, New York. Indeck-Yerkesstates that National Fuel Gas Supply (National) will transport up to 12,000Mcf per day of its imported gas on a firm basis from Niagara Falls throughthe new Niagara Spur Loop Line that would be constructed and jointly ownedby Tennessee, National, and PennEast Gas Service Company, to a point ofinterconnection with National's existing facilities at East Aurora, NewYork. From this point, the import will be delivered to National Fuel GasDistribution Corporation's pipeline facilities for subsequent deliveryto Indeck-Yerkes' Tonawanda cogeneration facility.In support of its application, Indeck-Yerkes states that the imported gasis needed as a long-term fuel supply for its new cogeneration facilityand that the gas would be purchased under competitive pricing terms withsufficient flexibility to assure that the imported gas would remain competitiveover the term of the requested authorization. Indeck-Yerkes further assertsthat Supply's agreements with its several Canadian sources of supply assuresit a secure supply of gas over the term.The decision on Indeck-Yerkes' application for import authroity will bemade consistent with the DOE's gas import policy guidelines, under whichthe competitiveness of an import arrangement in the markets served is theprimary consideration in determining whether it is in the public interest(49 FR 6684, February 22, 1984). Other matters that may be considered inmaking a public interest determination include need for gas, security ofthe long-term supply, and any relevant issues that may be unique to cogenerationfacilities. Parties that may oppose this application should comment intheir responses on the issues of competitiveness, need for the gas, andsecurity of supply as set forth in the policy guidelines. The applicantasserts that this import arrangement is in the public interest becauseit is competitive and its gas source will be secure. Parties opposing theimport arrangement bear the burden of overcoming these assertions. All parties should be aware that if the requested import is approved, theauthorization would be conditioned on the filing of quarterly reports indicatingvolumes imported and the purchase price. NEPA Compliance The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 <T3>et seq.</T3>) requires the DOE to give appropriate consideration tothe environmental effects of its proposed actions. The FERC, in DocketNos. CP88-94-000, CP88-194-000, and CP88-171-000, encompassing the projectsof National and Tennessee, is currently performing an environmental reviewof the impacts of constructing and operating the proposed pipeline facilitiesthrough which National would transport the import before making its decisionon the certificate applications. The DOE will participate in the environmentalreview process at the appropriate level. No final decision will be issuedin this proceeding until the DOE has met its NEPA responsibilities regardingthe Indeck-Yerkes application.
