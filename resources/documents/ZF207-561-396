Macintoshes.andP;  Nevertheless, the drug company isn't rulingout systems from Tandem Computers Inc. or any pertinent new product line thatDigital may come out with in the future.andM;Howington has been helping to set up the systems that will fuel themanufacturing operation for IL-2.andP;  The system, which she says performstypical manufacturing resource planning (MRP) II functions, has subsets thataddress the company's need to keep very detailed records.andP;  This recordkeeping will, among other things, enable Cetus to comply with the rigidquality control requirements mandated by the U.S.andP;  Food and DrugAdministration.andM;The system must also deal with various other considerations having to do withthe unique nature of the product.andP;  IL-2 is a genetially engineered humanprotein, and the production process is extremely complicated.andP;  During thatprocess, vast amounts of parametric data have to be collected and stored indata bases.andP;  Before being processed into the drug, the lots of raw materialsare analyzed in terms of the information in these data bases.andP;  These analyseswill enable Cetus engineers studying the characteristics of any particularlot to predict whether it will yield well or poorly at a later stage in theprocess.andP;  Until recently, Cetus was manually performing this criticalfunction, which it calls &quot;lot traceability,&quot; because its volumes were low.andM;As production levels rise, Cetus will be using a lot-trace module, part ofthe Control:Manufacturing software.andP;  The module provides an automated methodfor searching forward and backward throughout all stages of the productioniprocess, from raw material to finished product, to determine what happened toany particular material during the process.andM;This searching capability, points out Howington, is especially important inthe event that a batch is recalled or a question arises about the efficacy orsafety of a drug.andP;  The lot-traceability function is transparent, Howingtonnotes, so that &quot;when you do an inventory move that has been identified as alot-control product, the system updates the lot-trace chain automatically.&quot;andO;Also, when an order is shipped, the lot-trace chain of the finished goods isupdated and the customer is identified.andP;  That makes it easy to rapidly notifya customer about a product that has to be recalled.andM;The system must provide financial and accounting information, as well.andP;  Sothis past spring, the company installed the purchasing, accounts payable andreceivable, and order management modules of the Control software.andP;  &quot;Thenext-challenge is going to be to integrate all of the information [wegather], so that with a single transaction we can satisfy the business needto know what it is and where it is and how many do we have, as well as thetechnical need to identify where it is and what parametric data is associatedwith a particular item,&quot; sums up Howington.andM;One way to meet that challenge, according to Cetus information systemsdirector Ed Tamm, is to use a common data manager across all inforamtionsystems within the organization.andP;  Steps have already been taken in thatdirection with a data base management system (DBMS) from Oracle Corp.andP;  Theenormous amounts of parametric data collected during clinical trials by Cetusscientists have been organized under this DBMS, as have data used by thecompany's quality assurance staff.andM;Cetus is also installing process control software systems.andP;  All of thesystems will be integrated under a common data manager and made available notonly within the manufacturing arena but also throughout the entire company.andO;Using this integrated approach, Tamm hopes to support the Cetus operationswith a shoestring systems staff of 50 until the company reaches the $500million mark.andP;  That staff may find itself stretched thin for a while, sincerevenue on that order represents a 25-fold increase over Cetus' projectedtake for this year.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
