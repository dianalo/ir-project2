A system forsensitometric constancy control of film processors and their associatedcomponents is described. Experience with the system for 3 years is givenwhen implemented on 17 film processors. Modern high quality film processorshave a stability that makes a test frequency of once a week sufficientto maintain adequate image quality. The test system is so sensitive thatcorrective actions almost invariably have been taken before any technicalproblem degraded the image quality to a visible degree.</TEXT></DOC>
