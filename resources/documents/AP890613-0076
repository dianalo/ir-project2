(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The federal Equal Employment OpportunityCommission has sued on behalf of a state Supreme Court justice whois challenging the Vermont Constitution's requirement that judgesretire at age 70.   Justice Louis Peck turned 70 in December but refused to retire.He maintains that the requirement violates the federal ban on agediscrimination.   After several lawyers questioned Peck's right to hear cases, theadministrator of Vermont's courts put him on retirement statuseffective June 30. Peck filed a complaint with the EEOC, which suedin federal court late last week.   The state hired an outside lawyer to represent it because thestate attorney general has sided with Peck.   U.S. District Judge Lee Gagliardi, who is himself 70, has toldthe parties he hopes to decide the case by June 30, Gray said.   Gagliardi is one of roughly 300 federal judges on senior status.They are semi-retired, determine their own workload and handle about15 percent of federal cases. Federal judges can take senior statusas early as age 65.   About a dozen states have mandatory retirement for judges.   A federal appeals court in Massachusetts has upheld that state'sprovision, saying Congress did not mean for the Age Discriminationin Employment Act to apply to appointed state judges. But courts inother states have disagreed.</TEXT></DOC>
