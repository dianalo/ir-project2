Silver surged last week on the belief that industrialdemand for the precious metal should soar as the economygains steam. And that, silver bulls say, could signal thestart of a larger rally that will take prices back to $5 anounce this year.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The technicals and fundamentals are coming together in abullish scenario&quot; for silver, says Monroe Trout, who managesabout $225 million for Trout Trading Co. in Chicago.   Declares Joseph Rosenberg, chief investment officer atLoews Corp.: &quot;We are on the right side of a bottoming curve.&quot;Mr. Rosenberg manages the investment portfolio for Loews andhas been bullish on silver for awhile. He believes the metalis undervalued, mainly because the cost of production formany of the world's silver producers is higher than the priceof the metal.   But that isn't all that is appealing about silver. &quot;Youknow what the most bullish thing about silver is?&quot; asks Mr.Rosenberg. It is &quot;that until very recently, it was hard tofind any bulls.&quot;   Even though silver bulls stumbled Friday, silver for Marchdelivery ended up 18.5 cents an ounce at $4.29 for the week.The gains came amid a flurry of short-covering and a burst ofnew technically based buying from commodity funds. Traderscover short positions, or bets the price will fall, by buyingoffsetting contracts.   Because silver is heavily used in industry and is also acomponent in film and electronic goods, a rebound in theeconomy should benefit the price of metal, silver fanscontend.   But silver still has its skeptics, who have seen the metaltake off in a speculative frenzy, only to sink to $4 andbelow just as quickly.   &quot;The real key&quot; for this silver rally &quot;was when the FederalReserve dropped rates one full percentage point,&quot; says JerryWelch, publisher and editor of Commodity Insight, a St. Louismarket letter. The Fed's move to cut the discount rate itcharges on loans to financial institutions to 3.5% last monthspeeded up the timetable for an economic recovery and helpedpush silver prices higher, Mr. Welch says.   &quot;It's probably no coincidence&quot; that the March contract,after hitting a life-of-contract low of $3.81 on the day theFed cut short-term interest rates, has almost steadily gainedsince then, Mr. Trout says. &quot;Whenever the Fed eases or printsmoney, things like silver and gold tend to move up.&quot;   While Mr. Trout thinks the market could suffer a slightsetback in the coming weeks, he believes silver prices arepoised to rise, possibly to $5 an ounce by year end. Thereason he is so optimistic is because he thinks that for thefirst time in months, technical factors are also on silver'sside.   &quot;Fundamentally, I have been bullish for some time, buttechnically I was bearish&quot; until last month, when the Marchcontract fell below $3.82 and then popped back up, he says.What that showed was that &quot;silver tested a new low and therewere no sellers.&quot;   Mr. Trout's ebullience isn't universally shared, however.Some analysts point to silver's performance Friday as a causefor continued concern and say that as long as a supplyoverhang dogs the metal, silver will do poorly.   &quot;Most significant bull markets have a couple of days offollow-through,&quot; says Philip Gotthelf, editor of CommodityFutures Forecast, a New Jersey market letter. &quot;If you look atsilver {Friday}, it has stalled and that's a dangerous sign.&quot;   Mr. Gotthelf says that typically whenever silver risesabove the $4.18-an-ounce level, it is hit with a barrage ofproducer selling.   The future of silver will depend on who is the winner inthe &quot;battle between the funds that are technically orientedand the producers who want to sell silver above $4.18,&quot; Mr.Gotthelf says. Invariably, he says, &quot;the producers will winbecause they control the supply of silver.&quot;                                                                                                          Energy                                                                                                          Oil markets retain a bearish undertone because of weaksupply-demand fundamentals. Still, petroleum prices have beenfirming and are likely to rise further if this week bringsmore output cuts in the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries.   So far, seven of OPEC's 13 members -- Venezuela, Ecuador,Libya, Nigeria, Indonesia, Algeria and Iran -- have calledfor OPEC-wide production cuts to prop up oil prices, eithernow or when the oil ministers next meet on Feb. 12. Most ofthe seven already have cut their own output or announcedtheir intent to do so.   Two OPEC members -- Iraq and Kuwait -- don't count at themoment. But two other Persian Gulf producers really do count:United Arab Emirates and, particularly, Saudi Arabia, whichaccounts for more than one-third of OPEC's total volume of 24million barrels a day. Both increased output significantlyduring the Persian Gulf crisis. Both now are under mountingpressure to reduce production because of cuts by the others.   The other cuts have been modest -- even &quot;cosmetic,&quot;according to some oil traders. In all, they add up to lessthan 200,000 barrels a day. That's hardly 10% of the twomillion barrels a day some oil analysts insist OPEC will haveto trim to avoid a price crash if the usual seasonal weaknessin demand arrives in the second quarter.   But these small reductions have triggered a turn tochoppy, volatile trading. They may even have brought areversal of market psychology, if only temporarily. Afterplunging some $5 a barrel since October, prices suddenlyheaded higher last week. They gained about $1 a barrel forthe week and ended it on an upbeat. Crude oil for Februarydelivery rose 25 cents Friday to settle at $19.16 a barrel onthe New York Mercantile Exchange.                                                                                                          Grains andamp; Soybeans                                                                                                          Traders are divided over whether the wheat market cansustain last week's big rally.   At the Chicago Board of Trade, the price of the wheatfutures contract for March delivery rose seven cents a bushelto $4.20 amid reports that the U.S. wheat stockpile isshrinking to its tightest level since 1973.   Supplies are so tight that Midwest weather is having animpact on wheat prices -- even though the crop is dormantduring winter. Some traders are growing concerned that thiswinter's sharp temperature swings are causing Midwest wheatfields to heave, thus damaging the roots of young plants.Repeated freezing and thawing of the soil's surface causes itto crack.   Grain traders this week will continue to focus on whetherthe former Soviet republics can begin repaying U.S.food-buying loans that are beginning to come due. The loansare guaranteed by the U.S. government.   The conventional wisdom is that the group will satisfytheir obligations in order to continue receiving U.S.government credit guarantees, which already total $3.75billion.                                                                                                          Copper                                                                                                          The big question on copper traders' minds as the weekbegins is whether last week's rally will continue.   Copper for March delivery set a life-of-contract low of93.7 cents a pound last Monday, but at midweek began marchinghigher, ending at 97.3 cents on Friday.   &quot;This is a technical and financial rally, similar to thatof the stock market,&quot; said Richard Hirsch, vice president ofSharps Pixley in New York. Investors may be anticipating aneconomic recovery down the road, which would boost demand forindustrial metals, he said. But the current supply-and-demandfundamentals don't justify such a strong rally, he said.   Because of that, Mr. Hirsch said, he expects the rally tocontinue on technical factors, but wonders if it can besustained for long.</TEXT></DOC>
