An Arab League-brokered cease-fire that ended six months ofremorseless shelling battles between Christian and Syrian forceshas held for eight days.   But the daily crackle of automatic weapons along Beirut'sdividing Green Line, a daily ritual for so many years no oneconsiders it a violation, is a reminder of how volatile Lebanon is.   Many Lebanese, who have seen hundreds of cease-fires collapsesince the civil war began in 1975, consider this one nothing morethan a respite in a conflict that has defied the peacemakers.   Peace, they believe, is still far off.   Simon Hajj, a Christian taxi driver in east Beirut, does notbelieve the aging Lebanese legislators trying to hammer out asettlement in the Saudi Arabian resort of Taif will be able to comeup with the magic formula that has eluded everyone else.   Quoting an Arabic saying, he said ``they're just cooking a stonesoup _ It's something that can't be cooked.''   Hajj, 38, said: ``These people have been members of parliamentsince 1972 and they haven't been able to do anything to stop thewar. Why should we expect them to be magicians now?''   ``The best we can hope for from the Taif talks is an agreementon vaguely worded general principles,'' said columnist EmileKhoury, a Maronite Catholic who writes for the respectedindependent An-Nahar daily based in Moslem west Beirut.   ``Parliamentary subcommittees will be set up to negotiate thedetails and mechanisms to translate these general principles intoreality, a process which will take many, many months,'' he said.   Even then, many Lebanese believe, there are too many fighterswith a vested interest in perpetuating the conflict to make a finalsettlement attainable.   Although Parliament is one of the few constitutionalinstitutions to have surivived the civil war there is a generalconsensus that it is helpless to influence the warlords and foreignpowers who have kept the war going.   ``These men have no influence at all on the gunmen who foughtthe war,'' said Mustafa Koosh, 38, a Sunni Moslem and professionalwrestler.   The current parliament was elected for a four-year term in 1972,three years before the war broke out.   The fighting prevented general elections and the legislators inthe 99-seat House have simply voted themselves a new mandateperiodically since then.   The main Moslem and Christian militias, who have accrued widepower during the fighting that has fragmented Lebanon intosectarian cantons, as well as the splintered Lebanese army, have norepresentatives among the 73 surviving Parliament members, many ofwhom are in their 70s.   Moslem militia chieftains like Walid Jumblatt of the DruseProgressive Socialist Party, and Nabih Berri of the Shiite Amalmovement, both have denounced the political reforms being debatedin Taif as meaningless.   ``If Jumblatt or Berri veto any resolutions taken in Taif, who'sgoing to be able to implement them?'' Koosh asked.   Many people believe Parliament is incapable of disbanding themilitias, a move essential to ending the war.   Yet despite the gloom, many Beirutis say they will use thecurrent lull to get their businesses going again after the sixmonths of shelling, some of the fiercest of the war.   ``I'm going to repair my shop and resume business and I hopethis lull lasts long enough for me to make up my losses,'' saidPierre Shahine, whose electrical tools shop in east Beirut'slow-income Dora district was gutted.   The Lebanese despair is rooted in the failure of every peaceeffort that has been made, in too many years of fighting that haskilled more than 150,000 people, displaced another 1 million andruined the economy.   But there are some optimists.   They pin their hopes on the prestige of King Fahd of SaudiArabia, one of the main driving forces behind the peace initiative,and the negotiating skills of senior aides to King Hassan II ofMorocco and President Chadli Bendjedid of Algeria.   The three heads of state make up a mediation committee formed byan Arab summit in Morocco in May.   ``The committee must have gotten solid assurance of cooperationfrom Syria, otherwise it wouldn't have flown the Lebaneseparliamentary deputies to Taif to discuss a settlement,'' saidSamir Honein, a Christian civil defense volunteer.   He contended that Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, caneasily prevail on Jumblatt and Berri to go along with anycompromise reached in Taif and that Christian leader Gen. MichelAoun cannot dissent without becoming an outcast in the Arab world.</TEXT></DOC>
