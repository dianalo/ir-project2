In an interview yesterday before departing for Jerusalem, the prime minister indicated his top priority will be to crack down on rioters for the sake of law and order and peace prospects. &quot;If we are interested in the peace process, we have to make an end to this very soon,&quot; he said, referring to the disturbances under way now for more than 100 days.    While it isn't known what President Reagan and Secretary of State George Shultz told the prime minister last week, if either engaged in arm-twisting it doesn't seem to have worked. During a half-hour interview, the prime minister seemed far more confident than combative.    &quot;Under the pressure of these riots there won't be any progress in any negotiations for peace,&quot; he said, discussing his refusal to say yes to a new U.S. peace plan. &quot;The rioters are in a euphoric mood. They aren't able to accept any compromise.&quot;    Asked if he is ready to stiffen what many of Israel's friends already regard as brutal tactics to control the rock-throwing Palestinians, he said, &quot;It is our duty. We are looking for ways to do it, taking into account our moral restraints.&quot;    If Mr. Shamir appeared calmly confident about the work ahead of him, he also seemed realistic. The prime minister didn't try to blame Israel's problems with its fast-growing Palestinian population on a few radicals or the media. He called the rock-throwing by Palestinian youths &quot;a new kind of warfare&quot; and said Israel will triumph over it as it has previous confrontations with its Arab opponents. &quot;I'm sure (the rioting) will also fail,&quot; he said, &quot;but we have to prove it.&quot;    For the moment, the prime minister seems determined to put the U.S. peace plan behind him and focus on restoring order in Israel. Mr. Shultz's peace plan calls for talks between Israel and a Palestinian-Jordanian delegation in the context of an international conference with the Soviets, Americans, Chinese, French and British present. Mr. Shamir insists such a conference would be a forum for Israel-bashing and he won't attend.    Nor, he said, would he precipitate an early election in Israel to help resolve a bitter dispute between him and his foreign minister, Shimon Peres, who favors Mr. Shultz's peace plan.    &quot;From time to time we take advice from our American friends on how to advance the cause of peace, but I won't take advice on our internal problems,&quot; he said when asked if he plans to fire Mr. Peres and allow Israelis an early opportunity to have an election fought out on the issue of how to pursue peace with the Arabs.    Mr. Shamir's second-order priority appears to be removing refugee camps in Israel where some Palestinians have been living, often in squalor, since Israel's creation more than 40 years ago. He said he favors an international conference on the subject because Israel alone can't afford the cost, which he put at $2 billion, of doing away with the camps. &quot;We need an international financial effort,&quot; he said.    Exactly where the Palestinians in the camps would go isn't clear. Arab states with the exception of Jordan refuse to give passports and citizenship to Palestinians, in part to keep the pressure on Israel to provide a homeland for the more than one million Palestinians in Gaza and on the West Bank, both occupied by Israel. Some right-wing Israelis talk of evicting the camps' Palestinians to Arab nations. Others would resettle them in new villages elsewhere in the occupied territories.    The prime minister, like much of the world, professes confusion as to what triggered the outburst of Palestinian anger. He quoted Mideast scholar Bernard Lewis as saying the riots were sparked by a feeling among Palestinians that Israel is no longer invincible. &quot;After the riots started, the Palestinians have seen that Israel is not very mighty at quelling the riots,&quot; and this has prolonged them, he implied.    But while some Palestinians have been stirred by Islamic fundamentalism, the Afghan resistance to the Soviets and Iranian resistance to a militarily superior Iraq, the driving force is &quot;hatred for Israel and the Jewish people,&quot; he said.    Whatever the motivation, Mr. Shamir seems to have concluded that Israel faces a determined Palestinian opposition that it can't simply wear down but must confront and conquer, and he voiced willingness to take on that task. </TEXT></DOC>
