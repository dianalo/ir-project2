Police and court officials have identified the South African,Dunley Richard Stacely, as one of two men held for investigation ofa May 18 attempted hijacking of a Soviet Aeroflot jet toJohannesburg. The plane was en route from Luanda, Angola, to Dar esSalaam.   Many details of the incident remain sketchy. Unconfirmed reportshave said the African National Congress, the leading guerrillagroup fighting the South African government, chartered the jet totransport its members evacuating bases in Angola.   Authorities in South Africa have denied responsibility, butsecurity officials there have blamed the hijacking attempt ondisgruntled guerrillas who wanted to return home.   It is not known if Stacely was a member of South Africa'ssecurity forces.   He pleaded guilty Thursday before High Court Judge NasoroMnzavas to charges of endangering and injuring passengers. Thejudge first ordered journalists and spectators out of the courtroom.   Court officials have identified Stacely as a 30-year-old whiteSouth African. One official said Stacely admitted taking handgrenades, explosives and detonators aboard the jet.   A police officer in Dar es Salaam said Soviet guards on theplane shot and injured a would-be hijacker who demanded the jet flyto Johannesburg because a ``Russian communist wanted in SouthAfrica'' was aboard. A crew member was also reported injured.   A court official said another South African faces similarcharges.   Oliver Tambo, president of the African National Congress, hasacknowledged his group was evacuating bases in Angola.   Pressed by journalists to address the reports that his groupchartered the jet, Tambo said only, ``It is a serious matter foranybody to try and hijack a plane to Johannesburg with ANC memberson board, even four.''   His group is the largest African nationalist group fighting theSouth African government and its apartheid policy of racialdiscrimination. The Congress is banned in South Africa andmaintains headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia.   The Soviet Embassy in Dar es Salaam has refused to discuss thehijacking attempt.</TEXT></DOC>
