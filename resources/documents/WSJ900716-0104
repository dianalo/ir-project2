That's the concept behind SimEarth, a personal computergame created by Will Wright, the Berkeley, Calif., author ofSimCity, last year's hit computer game with highbrows thatlet players rebuild actual cities, such as San Franciscoafter the 1906 earthquake and Hamburg after it was bombed in1944, or design imaginary cities from scratch.   SimEarth extends this idea to the planet itself, givingplayers a chance to change the course of the Earth's historyby altering environmental forces. A few inspired choices, and&quot;dinosaurs won't die off but will rule, and humans won't everappear,&quot; Mr. Wright says.   Mr. Wright hopes that SimEarth, which will be available onApple Macintosh computers next month and on InternationalBusiness Machines compatibles soon afterward, will raiseawareness about the intricate connections among naturalforces. In the game, for example, it's a challenge merely tolay the conditions for multicellular life, much less to sparkthe Renaissance. Indeed, promoting civilization is hard: Mr.Wright says a player bent on improving humanity's lot mayhave to unleash a meteor shower that puts an entireprehistoric people at risk. &quot;Without periodic extinctions,&quot;he says, &quot;evolution may not occur.&quot;   In designing a program to simulate the possible lives ofthe Earth, Mr. Wright joins a growing tradition. Computermodels came into fashion in the 1970s, when the Club of Romeissued a gloomy warning on environmental trends based on asimulation. Today, such models lay the basis for everythingfrom forecasting the depletion of the ozone layer topredicting next week's weather.   Mr. Wright doesn't take too gloomy a view. A skillfulplayer can keep the Earth alive until the Sun explodes fivebillion years from now. And even then, Mr. Wright affords theplayer the tools to colonize outer space.                                                                                                          Laptop Makers in U.S.   Look to Japan for Color                                                                                                          NEW color screens will whet people's appetites for laptopcomputers, but they may upset the balance of power betweenU.S. and Japanese computer makers.   The Japanese are the dominant suppliers of these criticalparts, and the specter of a shortage has U.S. companieshustling to nail down long-term supplies of color displaysfor laptops, especially screens that use an advancedactive-matrix technique just now coming on the market.   U.S. companies fear a repeat of the the 1980s, whenJapan's behemoths gained control of the market for memorychips by pricing these parts at below cost to drive U.S.suppliers out of the business. As a result of that coup, U.S.computer makers have paid more for memory chips, a majormaterials cost for their products.   Among U.S. computer makers, IBM seems least likely to becaught in a bind. It struck a deal last year to produce thesescreens jointly in Japan with Toshiba. Hitachi and Sharp alsoare offering these displays to U.S. companies. Once volumeproduction begins next year, they will sell their now-priceycolor screens at below cost in order to prime demand,predicts Stanford Resources Inc., a San Jose, Calif., marketresearcher.                                                                                                          Making Networks as Fast   As Machines They Link                                                                                                          DESIGNERS are starting to pay attention to a thornyproblem involving increasingly powerful desktop computersused by engineers and scientists.   Almost all of these computers are linked with othermachines, and the networks aren't getting any faster. As aresult, the raw speed of the new workstations is being wastedwhen users share or swap data, which occurs often.   Designers are tackling the problem by building devicesthat transfer data among workstations and among differentnetworks of machines at a hundred times the current speed of10 million bits of data a second.   The National Science Foundation, the Lawrence LivermoreNational Laboratory and many private companies are fundingefforts to build speedier networks, which will change thenature of computing by making it possible for a scientist toreceive live video or realistic color models on aworkstation.   But this change won't be painless. Current standards fornetworks, such as Ethernet and Token Ring, may need to beoverhauled or even scrapped. And so will current desktopcomputers used by researchers. &quot;This is probably the singlemost interesting problem that I'm dealing with,&quot; says AndreasBechtolsheim, a computer designer at Sun Microsystems Inc.                                                                                                          Recording Music on CDs   Isn't Around the Corner                                                                                                          CONSUMERS won't be able to record on blank compact disksfor a few years.   Equipment that both records on and plays CDs is considereda sure-fire hit with consumers, but a combination of factorshave kept such machines off the market so far.   Officials at Sony Corp. and N.V. Philips, which controlpatents on most CD technology, say that a few technicalproblems remain before such products are finished, but thatthe biggest hurdle is persuading the music industry towithdraw its opposition to recordable CDs, which the industrythinks will reduce sales of prerecorded CDs.   After seeing the music industry delay the introduction ofdigital-audio tape, there's little optimism that fears aboutrecordable CDs can be dispelled quickly. &quot;We expect the same(opposition) . . . so we won't force-feed this,&quot; says a Sonyexecutive.</TEXT></DOC>
