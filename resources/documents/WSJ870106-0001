Payments to doctors would be cut, medical assistance payments for the poor would be capped, but funding to fight acquired immune deficiency syndrome would jump.    Medicare fees to radiologists, anesthesiologists and pathologists would be included in set payments to hospitals that are determined by illness categories. Reductions would be made for physician procedures the department considers overpriced.    Premiums paid by recipients for the optional medical, as opposed to hospital, insurance program would rise, as would the deductible. At the same time, coverage for certain services, such as care by optometrists and some occupational therapy, would end.    The department is proposing to cap Medicaid payments to the states at $25.4 billion, a $1.3 billion cut. The states would determine what health services for the poor would be affected. AIDS funding would rise 28% to $534 million.    Doctors and their congressional allies will continue to strongly fight proposals that would curtail their income.    EDUCATION   The proposed Education Department budget would cut expenditures to $14.7 billion from $17 billion this fiscal year. The college-student aid request would drop to $4.5 billion from $8.2 billion, vocational education funding would be eliminated, and funding for an anti-drug program would be slashed by half.    The decrease in student financial aid includes the proposed elimination of the work-study program and reductions in guaranteed student loans and Pell Grants. But income-contingent loans, which carry no federal subsidy, are slated for a big increase. Aid to historically black colleges would drop by nearly two-thirds.    As a result of the student-aid cuts, the number of student awards is expected to drop to 6.4 million from 9.4 million, according to the department's budget document.    Secretary William Bennett wants $200 million in increased funding -- to $4.1 billion -- for disadvantaged children served by the Chapter 1 program. Funding for handicapped children and adults would be increased slightly. Two programs designed to aid desegregation, with a combined current budget of $24 million, would be killed.    Congress is expected to reject many of the department's proposals, as it has in the past several years.    WELFARE   Aid to Families with Dependent Children drops in the proposed budget to $9.5 billion from $9.9 billion. The Department of Health and Human Services plans to reduce and eliminate certain federal matching administrative payments to states for AFDC, Medicaid and Food Stamp programs. The projected savings total $16 million.    The administration will continue to emphasize its belief that AFDC recipients should participate in a work-related activity. Under the Greater Opportunities Through Work program, which would replace the Work Incentive program, parents of young children would be required to be in school, training or employment. The department estimates this would save $102 million.    Many of the administration's welfare proposals may be superseded by broad welfare-revision efforts in Congress.    HOUSING AND URBAN AID   The budget would eliminate or cut several popular urban-aid and housing programs, reducing overall spending by $705.2 million, to $13.92 billion. Some proposals, previously spurned by Congress and fought by interest groups, again could fail because of heightened public concern over the homeless and other urban poor.    The Department of Housing and Urban Development would kill urban-development action grants, which foster private development in distressed areas. It also would drop or curb funds for three programs that help build or renovate apartments for the elderly, the disabled, low-income and middle-income families. But because of a spending lag, the two programs being axed would continue in fiscal 1988.    A 7.4% cut to $3 billion in outlays for community-development block grants, which help pay for municipal improvements and rehabilitated housing, could hurt big Sun Belt cities the most because of a proposed targeting of more funds to the neediest cities.    The president would add about 79,000 direct-rent subsidies or vouchers, the cornerstone of his assisted-housing policy -- 29,000 more than he sought and won a year ago. The HUD budget also would experimentally let public-housing tenants use vouchers to seek private units; a House-passed bill last year had a similar plan.    EMPLOYMENT   Labor Department programs to aid dislocated workers would be replaced with an expanded program of job-search, counseling and literacy and skills training. Spending would climb to $980 million from $344 million for comparable programs this fiscal year.    Workers, including those who lost their farms, would receive assistance regardless of whether they were thrown out of work by imports or were permanently laid off. But cash benefits wouldn't be provided.    Overall, outlays for employment programs, which the administration has tried to trim in the past, would rise to $4.9 billion from $4.6 billion. A revamped youth-employment program would give local governments the option of providing year-round training and summer jobs, rather than just summer jobs, to teen-age children of families receiving federal assistance. Spending would rise $50 million to $800 million. Job Corps would be funded at $652 million to maintain the current 40,500 training slots for disadvantaged youth.    The administration also proposes to increase premiums some employers pay to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp. And it wants to exempt small government construction projects from requirements that workers be paid the prevailing wage.    VETERANS   The Veterans Administration is proposing to increase its budget to $27.2 billion from $27 billion, but would eliminate medical-care funding for single veterans with annual incomes of more than $20,000. Just over $605 million is requested for VA education and training programs, a drop of $136 million because fewer veterans are eligible, the agency says.    The administration plans to save $390 million by increasing the fee for home loan guarantees to 2.5% of the loan amount from 1%. The no-downpayment feature would be retained.    Compensation payments to 2.2 million veterans with service-related disabilities would be tied to the inflation rate. The politically powerful veterans organizations are expected to fight proposals that would limit medical and other services to their members.    TRANSPORTATION   The president proposed selling Amtrak and slashing funds for mass transit, while increasing spending for the Federal Aviation Administration's long-term modernization plan and other aviation safety measures.    Transportation Department spending would fall 6%, or $1.58 billion, to $24.63 billion. Amtrak subsidies would be eliminated and the passenger railroad's assets sold, bringing in an estimated $1 billion. But Congress is likely to balk, and finding a buyer for the money-losing railroad may be tough. The budget also would end discretionary grants for transit systems and close the Interstate Commerce Commission. Congress has rejected similar cuts before.    A hefty increase in the FAA account would boost a decade-long effort that includes such things as improving technology for bad-weather landings and detecting wind shear. The budget provides for increasing the controller work force by 225 to 15,225; the number of aviation inspectors would rise by 178 to 2,198. Grants to airports would increase slightly, and some grants would be turned over to the states to distribute to small airports. For highways, 150 motor-carrier safety specialists would be added, and states would be given more flexibility in spending aid.    SPACE AND SCIENCE   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's budget would increase substantially, as the space program continues its struggle to recover from the Challenger disaster.    Spending by NASA would rise 21%, or $1.66 billion, to $9.53 billion. Increases for space flight reflect efforts to correct flaws in the shuttle's solid-fuel booster rockets and to implement other safety measures proposed by the Challenger commission.    The budget also includes money to continue work on a new orbiter; Congress already has appropriated $2.1 billion for the spacecraft, and NASA may begin spending the funds next August. The budget also provides for spending increases for the space station and the aerospace plane. National Science Foundation research spending would total $1.8 billion, up from $1.57 billion this year. The foundation would establish as many as 10 science and technology centers to perform research and encourage its transfer to the marketplace.    ENERGY   The president proposes to continue diverting spending from energy development and production to basic science and the military.    Funds for research on conservation and solar energy would be cut, while purchases for the strategic oil reserve would fall to 35,000 barrels daily from 75,000. Citing the uncertain future of U.S. uranium enrichment, the president also proposed to drop all research and development on laser uranium-enrichment technology. Congress is expected to reject these plans. The U.S. already has abandoned a $2.6 billion centrifuge enrichment plant, saying lasers are more promising.    The budget would scrub research into gas-cooled nuclear reactors, but would boost funds for research on a liquid-metal reactor, an international fusion reactor, a U.S. fusion research facility and clean coal plants.    The president repeated his plan to sell the Naval Petroleum Reserves and the five regional power administrations. Selling the reserves, which has little opposition, is projected to net $2.5 billion in fiscal 1988. Congress has stymied most power agency sales, but may agree to accelerate repayment of their construction costs.    Energy Department nuclear weapons spending would rise about $400 million to $7.8 billion, with research increasing on the Star Wars missile-defense system and a small reactor for use in space.    AGRICULTURE   Farm assistance would be modestly trimmed, with larger cuts planned for later years under proposals to slash farmer income-support payments and many direct-loan programs.    The budget predicts basic farm-subsidy outlays of $21.27 billion in fiscal 1988, down 13% from this year and 18% below the record $25.81 billion in fiscal 1986. The drop reflects the advance of some grower income-protection payments from fiscal 1988 to the current fiscal year, and an expected smaller corn crop resulting from federal cash inducements for farmers to reduce plantings. The administration, again seeking to cut future income-aid &quot;targets,&quot; forecasts that subsidies will decline 51% further by fiscal 1992.    Farmers Home Administration, rural-electric and telephone and crop-insurance outlays would fall a net 47%, to $4.78 billion, this fiscal year under proposals to kill or slash most direct-loan programs and instead guarantee more private loans or sell loans to private lenders. The outlays would then rise 13% in fiscal 1988, partly from a new voucher system for certain rural rental housing. Food and nutrition aid would ease 4%, to $18.57 billion.    The spending-cut plans, which mostly repeat past proposals, are expected to meet stiff congressional resistance again.    ENVIRONMENT   The Environmental Protection Agency's spending would remain unchanged at $4.6 billion while the Interior Department's would drop more than $800 million to about $4.4 billion, partly because of asset sales and curbs on construction and land acquisition.    The president again proposed deferring park and refuge land purchases and construction, and rescinding about $200 million of their fiscal 1987 funds, but Congress isn't likely to go along.    He also would trim the Interior Department payroll by almost 1,000 jobs, sell more than $500 million in small, low-interest, irrigation loans for $154 million, and auction helium-distribution facilities for $50 million. Aid to Micronesia's transition to a new government is slated to fall by about $200 million.    Pollution regulation would remain stable, but the president proposed withholding $47.5 million in loans that Congress has approved to remove hazardous asbestos from schools.    The administration slated spending $900 million for Superfund toxic-waste cleanups and $1.8 billion for sewer-construction grants, but Congress is likely to boost both. Lawmakers are preparing to clear $18 billion more for the grants through 1994, and Mr. Reagan has agreed to back $12 billion. Either plan would raise 1988 grants.    LAW ENFORCEMENT   The Justice Department is slated to receive nearly $1 billion more to phase in new immigration laws, build more jails and enhance the Federal Bureau of Investigation. But Congress is almost certain to demand substantially larger increases.    The proposed increase to $5.8 billion from $4.8 billion for the Justice Department is substantially less than most lawmakers -- and even the administration itself -- envisioned only a few months ago. Overall, the president wants to cut to $2.5 billion from about $3 billion in spending for all anti-drug programs.    Congressional critics, including many Republicans, are almost certain to balk and accuse Mr. Reagan of reneging on earlier promises. Lawmakers are likely to approve heftier boosts for border patrol guards and drug enforcement, and probably will reject proposed cuts for antitrust enforcement and state grants to prevent drug abuse and juvenile delinquency.    POSTAL SERVICE   The administration proposed eliminating the subsidy for most nonprofit mailers, but earmarked $72 million in subsidies for publications for the blind.    With the end of the subsidy, which totals $650 million in fiscal 1987, the postal service either would have to increase postage rates for such mailers as schools, libraries, churches and small newspapers or make up the difference by increasing rates for commercial mailers.    Postmaster General Preston Tisch has said that no general postal rate increase is expected this year.    FOREIGN AID   Foreign aid would rise to $15.2 billion from an estimated $14 billion, as the administration tries to recoup from past congressional cuts. But &quot;it will be a tough struggle even to maintain current levels,&quot; predicts a congressional budget aide.    The State Department also is requesting supplemental spending of $559 million for fiscal 1987, with about $100 million earmarked for emergency earthquake relief for El Salvador. For 1988, the department is proposing to spend $102 million for a new economic development fund for Africa. But the new spending would be offset by a reduction of $185 million in other international development-assistance programs.    The two largest recipients of foreign assistance, Israel and Egypt, which received a total of about $5.3 billion in military and economic aid in 1987, would receive about the same amount next year.    ---                    Reagan Budget at a Glance                    (In billions of dollars)                           Fiscal Year      1987     1988     1989     1990     1991     1992    Defense     $282.2   $297.6   $312.2   $330.0   $349.5   $370.9    Foreign aid and other international programs       14.6     15.2     18.1     17.9     18.0     17.7    Energy, environment and natural resources       17.7     17.5     18.1     18.5     17.8     17.6    Agriculture       31.1     26.3     21.8     18.2     14.7     13.0    Health and education       69.5     67.3     69.3     70.2     71.4     72.1    Social Security and Medicare      279.5    292.4    313.6    334.7    357.4    379.9    Federal pensions, unemployment and other income security      124.9    124.8    128.7    133.5    138.9    143.6    Veterans' benefits       26.7     27.2     27.6     28.0     28.6     29.0    Revenue sharing and other fiscal assistance        1.9      1.5      1.5      1.6      1.7      1.7    Other outlays       67.1     60.8     62.3     64.8     65.7     67.1    Net interest      137.5    139.0    141.5    139.0    134.8    122.1    Offsetting receipts      -37.1    -45.4    -45.8    -48.5    -54.0    -55.6    TOTAL OUTLAYS   $1,015.6 $1,024.3 $1,069.0 $1,107.8 $1,144.4 $1,178.9    TOTAL REVENUES     $842.4   $916.6   $976.2 $1,048.3 $1,123.2 $1,191.2    (Deficit) Surplus    $(173.2) $(107.8)  $(92.8)  $(59.5)  $(21.3)   $12.3    NOTE: All figures estimated   ---            Economic Assumptions Used in the Budget                 (Dollar amounts in billions) CALENDAR YEAR:    1986     1987     1988     1989     1990 GNP              $4,218*  $4,493   $4,816   $5,165   $5,524 GNP growth**     2.7%     3.2%     3.7%     3.6%     3.6% Personal income  $3,493   $3,700   $3,941   $4,201   $4,452 Pre-tax profits  $240     $309     $341     $377     $411 Inflation#       0.9%     3.8%     3.6%     3.5%     3.0% Jobless rate##   6.9%     6.5%     6.2%     5.9%     5.7% Interest   rates###       6.0%     5.4%     5.6%     5.3%     4.7%   Note: Data for 1986 are estimates; 1987 and 1988 figuresare forecasts, except for interest rates, which are trendprojections.
