Shreddingthe raw material and aerating the pile by turning are of utmost importancein this respect. In addition to nutritive and moisture contents, thesemeasures primarily determine the decomposing speed and the final productstructure. For the mechanization of these processes a variety of machinesare offered, which differ in their method of operation and in their costs.Shredders mainly differ in their power, which can be between 45,7 kWand 213 kW. This determines the flow rate of the machine, which can bebetween 15 m/sup 3//h and 80 m/sup 3//h depending on the type. The processingcosts per cubic meter raw material, which depend on the annual utilization,range between 1,90 DM/m/sup 3/ and 2,40 DM/m/sup 3/, when assuming 1000hours per year. The technology of turning and aerating the compost pileis based on various systems. The compost material is either picked upby a drum or by a scarper floor. Then it is mixed and aerated and finallya new pile is formed. Machines for aerating compost piles differ mainlyin their capacity, which depends on the power and the dimension of themachine. The costs for aerating the pile, depending on annual utilization,vary between 0,03 DM/t and 0,31 DM/t, when assuming 1000 hours per year.</TEXT></DOC>
