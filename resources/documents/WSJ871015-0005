The Federal Reserve, under the pressure of the falling dollar and rising interest rates abroad, soon may raise its discount rate at least half a percentage point to 6 1/2%, many economists say. Even if the Fed doesn't act, some analysts expect banks to raise their prime lending rates again soon, probably half a percentage point to 9 3/4%.    &quot;This has been some day,&quot; said Bruce R. Lakefield, executive vice president and manager of government bond trading at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc. &quot;Everybody just dove into their foxholes&quot; after the government reported a $15.68 billion merchandise trade deficit for August, instead of the $14.5 billion or so that most analysts expected. That compared with $16.47 billion in July.    Among the major developments:   --The latest 30-year Treasury bond now yields more than 10% for the first time since November 1985. It surged yesterday to about 10 1/8% from 9.90% Tuesday. At the beginning of this year, comparable Treasury bonds yielded only about 7 1/2%.    --Actively traded long-term Treasury bonds dropped more than two points, or over $20 for each $1,000 face amount. That was their biggest one-day setback since June 2, the day the White House disclosed that Paul Volcker had declined to accept a third term as Federal Reserve chairman. Corporate, municipal and mortgage-backed bond prices also fell sharply.    --Rates rose especially sharply on short-term Treasury bills. The rate on the latest six-month Treasury bills climbed about a quarter of a percentage point to about 7.6%.    Even though several Federal Reserve officials have tried to calm fears about inflation recently, investment managers remain deeply concerned. Some worry that higher inflation -- and higher interest rates -- are inevitable because of the falling dollar, and that the Federal Reserve may be losing control over events.    Even some money managers who think bonds now look attractive are reluctant to buy. &quot;This is not a good time to sell -- and probably is a good level at which to buy -- given our inflation forecast of only about 4% to 4 1/2% inflation over the next few years,&quot; said Marshall B. Front, executive vice president of Stein Roe andamp; Farnham Inc., a Chicago-based investment counseling firm.    &quot;But there's no one out there who wants to be a hero, no one who is willing to stick his neck out,&quot; Mr. Front said. He said the trade figures yesterday were &quot;a crushing blow, and the market staggered beneath them all day.&quot;    A discount rate increase &quot;could come at any time,&quot; possibly as soon as tomorrow, said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. The discount rate is the fee the Fed charges on loans to banks and savings institutions.    Higher interest rates in West Germany have aroused further speculation that the Federal Reserve will feel compelled to raise U.S. rates to protect the dollar. But, according to one Fed policy maker, &quot;We don't feel the same obligation on the exchange rate if it's because of their (West Germany) tightening.&quot;    Fed officials in recent days have been emphasizing that they see no signs inflation is accelerating. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan stressed this in a speech Tuesday afternoon, as did H. Robert Heller, a Fed governor, in a television interview Tuesday morning.    Nevertheless, some analysts say the Fed already may be tightening credit slightly. They point to recent increases in the federal funds rate, which is the rate on reserves that banks lend each other overnight. The funds rate averaged about 7 5/8% yesterday and Tuesday, up from an average of 7.43% in the week ended Oct. 7. These analysts argue that the increase was engineered by the Fed.    But other analysts insist that the higher funds rate was caused merely by technical factors. They contend that the Fed hasn't altered policy and that it won't do so unless it feels compelled to because of runaway fear about inflation.    In the bond market yesterday, the latest 30-year Treasury issue, the government's 8 7/8% bonds due 2017, fell to a price of 88 from 90 6/32 Tuesday. The yield jumped to 10.16%, the highest since late November 1985.    The yield on 10-year Treasury notes is even higher than on 30-year bonds. The government's 8 5/8% notes due 1997 slumped to a price of 90 3/8 to yield 10.19%. On Tuesday, the issue was quoted at 92 6/32, to yield 9.89%.    Shearson Lehman's index of long-term Treasury bonds fell 25.23 points, its largest decline since June 2, to close at 1131.16. It ranged between 1130.44 and 1148.43.    In the municipal bond market, prices of some bellwether issues tumbled about two points. The municipal market's mood has been especially bleak lately because of Salomon Brothers Inc.'s decision to phase out its municipal department and Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co.'s staff cutbacks. Other firms are expected to announce similar moves soon.    In the new-issue sector, the New Jersey Wastewater Treatment Trust sold about $117 million of wastewater treatment insured loan revenue bonds, due 1988-2007. The bonds are rated triple-A by Moody's Investors Service Inc. They were priced for reoffering, after an auction yesterday, to yield from 5.75% on bonds due 1988 to about 9.05% on bonds due 2005-2007, according to Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.    In the corporate sector, underwriters led by First Boston Corp. offered $110 million of senior subordinated notes of M.A. Hanna Co. The 12 1/2% notes, due Oct. 15, 1994, were priced at 98.86 to yield 12.75%. The notes, which are noncallable for five years, are rated Ba-2 by Moody's and double-B-minus by Sandamp;P. </TEXT></DOC>
