In each of the CT scans, liver density measurements wereless than those of the spleen. While the findings are non-specific, inthe proper clinical context they are highly suggestive and may be thesole method of diagnosis, as these patients often have coagulation problemswhich rule out liver biopsy. It is an important diagnosis, as the highmaternal and fetal mortality rates appear to be considerably reducedby early foetal delivery.</TEXT></DOC>
