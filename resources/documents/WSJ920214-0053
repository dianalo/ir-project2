The Veterans Administration this month sent $560 millionin life-insurance dividend checks to 1.6 million veteransinstead of waiting until their annual policy anniversaries.That hasn't happened since 1977. The EPA speeds up grants,says Gary Bass of OMB Watch, to make sure the president isn't&quot;vulnerable&quot; on the environment.</LP><TEXT>   The White House decision to drop its proposed middle-classtax cut is also done with an eye toward near-term politics.With Bush under attack by conservative Buchanan in Tuesday'sNew Hampshire primary, advisers want to protect thepresident's right flank. The focus is on economic growthrather than the middle class.   Treasury chief Brady hints to the Senate Finance Committeethat the White House may be willing to revise itspassive-loss plan to make it even more generous to thereal-estate industry.                                                                                                          AN EARLY KNOCKOUT of Buchanan depends on Tuesday'sresults.   Bush strategists think a big win would decimate the GOPchallenger's campaign, arguing New Hampshire is Buchanan'sstrongest state. But Bush, who has been slipping in thepolls, faces an uphill struggle to get the more than 60% ofthe vote and a 2-to-1 margin needed for that sort of triumph.Some advisers argue Bush should go negative in closing days.   Others, though, still argue that course would onlyalienate the right later. &quot;The Buchanan campaign will fizzleon its own,&quot; predicts American Conservative Union ChairmanDavid Keene. If Buchanan gets close to 35% next Tuesday, hethinks he can take Bush on in Georgia on March 3 and a weeklater pull a surprise in Bush's home state of Texas. Money isa problem, but a strong showing would aid direct mailefforts.                                                                                                          DEMOCRATS' HOPES for a short presidential primary campaignevaporate.   Clinton's woes end hopes of getting an early nominee andavoiding a long fight. Even some likely New Hampshirealso-rans will stay in the race. Kerrey and Harkin face off aweek later in South Dakota; Nebraska's Kerrey sees supportout West.   Clinton still hopes his Southern base will buttresseroding support, but the draft issue hurts him in the region.Tsongas's strength will be re-evaluated if he wins big in NewHampshire; he plans to hit Maryland next and may challengeClinton in Georgia. His fund-raising surges, thoughGreek-Americans still haven't come forward big.   Two key dates for a new candidate entry: The filingdeadline for Ohio's primary is next Thursday and California'sis March 19, after the New York budget mess may be resolved.                                                                                                          POLITICAL TKO: Harkin's hope for a New Hampshire boostfrom his home-state Iowa caucuses win Monday night werekilled by the Mike Tyson rape decision. The guilty verdictcame just as the late news began that night, and TV stationsled with Tyson instead of Harkin. The next morning, Harkin'swin again was overshadowed.                                                                                                          TSONGAS'S VIEW that he is &quot;cured&quot; of non-Hodgkin'slymphoma because he has been cancer-free for over five yearsmakes some oncologists uneasy. &quot;It's not a word in myvocabulary,&quot; says Tak Takvorian, Tsongas's physician. Butexperts agree that Tsongas's medical history shouldn't bar apresidential run.                                                                                                          CBS FUMES about ABC's timing of a Democratic presidentialcandidates' debate March 5 after CBS's offer to carry thedebate at 10 p.m. prime time was rejected by organizers. ABCwill air the pre-Super Tuesday event in the &quot;Nightline&quot; 11:30p.m. (EST) slot -- &quot;when most people are asleep,&quot; complainsCBS's Martin Plissner.                                                                                                          ANOTHER CHOICE? Some Bush strategists worry aboutlittle-known Jim Lennane in Tuesday's primary. Thebusinessman is spending more than $500,000 on media buthasn't yet hit hard on his abortion rights view, popular inNew Hampshire. If he did, Bush backers fear he might get upto 5% of the vote, all from Bush.                                                                                                          DEMOCRATS FACE tough foreign-policy problems inchallenging Bush.   The party's presidential candidates, to please Jewishgroups, all want to be seen as favoring Israel's request for$10 billion in housing loan guarantees. But that undercutstheir vows to focus on the U.S. economy. To favor $10 billionin guarantees &quot;to a lot of Americans is going to sound alittle weird&quot; during hard times, says Mideast expert WilliamQuandt.   Fighting terrorism, an issue on which Bush is likely to beperceived as stronger, is about to return as attentionreverts to Libya. Libya has failed to turn over two suspectsin the Pan Am 103 bombing. Bush plans to push the SecurityCouncil next week for a sanctions resolution.   Tsongas blasts Bush's aid to the former Soviets as toolittle, but public support for big foreign aid is low --partly because of Democrats' past Bush bashing.                                                                                                          MINOR MEMOS: Tsongas says to avoid crying during a speechMonday on his cancer recovery he thought of a politicalenemy; during emotional moments he said to himself, &quot;Sununu,Sununu.&quot; . . . Buchanan stirred snickers and laughter in aspeech to the GOP-dominated New Hampshire legislature when hemerely mentioned Quayle. . . . As Democratic party chairmanBrown dismisses the idea of anyone new entering the race, aparty fund-raising letter on presidential preference offers achoice of &quot;other.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
