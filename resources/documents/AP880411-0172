The letter, which was a revised version of a petition preparedtwo weeks ago, was delivered to Chinese officials on Sunday.   A spokesman at the Chinese Embassy in Washington said the letterwas an ``inappropriate'' way to express discontent.   He denied that China's policy of sending students abroad wouldchange.   According to official reports in the Chinese press and a Chinesedocument seen in New York, China will let 3,000 students leaveChina this year. Of them, 600 will be sent to the United States.   Last year, 8,000 Chinese students came to the United Statesalone. In all, 40,000 Chinese students are studying worldwide,about 27,000 of them in America.   The embassy spokesman on Monday confirmed the existence of thedocument but said China was ``using it only as a test.''   ``We may change this document after using it for a couple ofmonths,'' he said.   Boston University history professor Merle Goldman said the newpolicy was aimed at limiting the West's influence on China.   The students' letter urged the Beijing government to continueChina's ``open door'' policy, started by Chinese leader DengXiaoping in 1979.   The policy seeks to improve China's economy by opening it to theWest.   The letter also demanded that Chinese citizens be given the``fundamental right'' to study wherever they wish for as long asthey wish.   ``The recent unreasonable changes in the policies on overseasstudy are fundamentally in conflict with the declared nationalpolicy of reform and open door,'' the letter said.   A Chinese student organizer, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, said 2,132 Chinese students from 141 researchinstitutions and universities in 38 American states had signed theletter.   Several students from Canada and Switzerland also signed thepetition, he said, although he did not specify the number.   Of the signatories, 1,279 provided their real names, an act Ms.Goldman described as ``courageous.''   ``The students could be subject to reprisals once they returnhome,'' she said. ``They could lose good jobs, even their relativescould suffer.''   The letter marked the second time Chinese students in the UnitedStates have banded together to oppose policy changes in Beijing.   In January 1987, more than 1,000 students signed a letter to theBeijing government criticizing a crackdown on their fellow studentsin China who had demonstrated for democracy in late 1986.   Of those students, 482 signed their real names.   Chinese students said most of those who signed the lettersranged from their late 20s to their mid-40s, the generation raisedduring China's ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution, which lasted from1965 to 1975.   Ms. Goldman said this was significant because it showed theaffect that decade had on many Chinese.   ``Mao Tse-tung taught them to criticize and question everythingand that's what they're doing,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
