In 1990, some 170,000 Soviet citizens emigrated toGermany, most of them of ethnic German heritage. Some 600,000of the two million ethnic Germans still living in the SovietUnion reportedly plan to emigrate to Germany if Moscowliberalizes its travel laws this year. And Bonn officialsfear other Soviet citizens could join in a mass westwardmigration if the region's socioeconomic structures collapse.</LP><TEXT>   German states also are trying to find solutions for thethousands of emigrating Soviet Jews expected to continuearriving in coming months. As many as 4,000 Soviet Jews leftthe U.S.S.R. for Germany this year; the actual number isdifficult to determine because of a visa-free immigration lawcarried over from the former East Germany. Last Friday,Berlin authorities reported that 1,404 Soviet Jews were intemporary housing awaiting processing, although many were intransit to Israel or elsewhere.   Imposing a quota on the number of Soviet Jews permitted toresettle in Germany is one option, but it's a politicallysensitive decision that German state governors are reluctantto make. One official, Herbert Schnoor, interior minister forNorth-Rhine Westphalia, proposed that Germany accept 10,000Soviet Jews annually.   After absorbing hundreds of thousands of ethnic Germansfrom Eastern Europe since 1989, the German government says itwould be utterly incapable of absorbing another, larger wave.Western German cities already are coping with an acutehousing shortage, and as many as two million eastern Germanscould be out of work next year as the region stumbles towarda market economy.   Federal and state financial resources are stretched byeastern Germany's hefty restructuring costs. InteriorMinister Wolfgang Schaeuble, speaking on a recent televisionbroadcast, said that huge refugee camps would be unavoidablein the case of a mass influx. Mr. Schaeuble added thatGermany also would ask its West European neighbors to absorbsome of the refugees if Germany's capacity was overwhelmed.Bonn reportedly is pressing for a Europewide migrationconference next year to coordinate plans for coping withrefugees from the East.   &quot;If it really does come to a flood from the East of maybeseveral million people to the West, then a real emergencywill arise not only for Germany but Europe,&quot; warned MaxStreibl, the governor of Bavaria, in a newspaper interview.   Mr. Schaeuble, the interior minister, a close adviser toChancellor Helmut Kohl, said the country sees itselfobligated to accept any ethnic Germans seeking to start a newlife in Germany; other Soviet citizens would be denied Germanvisas. Meanwhile, claims of German heritage are beingscrutinized after authorities confiscated fraudulentdocumentation stemming from the Third Reich and earlier. AGerman court ruled last week that refugees who falsifiedtheir ethnic background will be denied free housing andlanguage lessons.   Complicating any Western European controls is an impendingagreement between Bonn and Warsaw to lift visa requirementsfor Poles visiting Germany, a step expected to bring ageneral loosening of German-Polish border controls. Germanand other European officials fear that a porous Polish bordercould become a funnel for immigrants from farther east. WestEuropean governments are expected to ask the Polishgovernment to increase controls on Poland's eastern borderwith the Soviet Union.   But Germany is focusing its policy on stemming any futuremigration at the source, namely by pouring financial andmaterial aid into the affected regions. This, it is hoped,will inspire hope and persuade local populations to stay put.The opposition Social Democrats urged that the West devise a&quot;Marshall Plan&quot; for Eastern Europe.   Germany this year has led the industrialized world inaiding the Soviet Union with multibillion-dollar credits,food and medical supplies. Last Sunday, Foreign MinisterHans-Dietrich Genscher chided other Western democracies fornot following suit. Holding up his country as an example, hesaid, &quot;I can't say that all Western countries have met thischallenge in the same way, in the same scope and with thesame insights when gauging the need to help the {Soviet}reform policies.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
