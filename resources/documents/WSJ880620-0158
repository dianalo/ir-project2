The office, a research arm of Congress, recommends that the government establish a Commercial Technology Agency, with an annual budget between $100 million and $500 million, to aid high-risk research and solve technical problems hindering U.S. efforts to commercialize new technology. The agency would be modeled after the Defense Department's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which explores next-generation technology that might aid the military.    The technology office is preparing a final version of the report, which it expects to release June 28 to coincide with hearings scheduled by the Senate Government Affairs Committee. The conclusions in the final report are expected to mirror the draft report. But the final report's wording may be more guarded, reflecting the conflicting opinions of agencies and individuals who have reviewed the draft.    The report is bound to be controversial because of its optimism about how quickly superconductor products will reach the market. In addition, it could draw fire for its criticism that excessive reliance on defense applications could slow the pace of commercial superconductor projects and for its advocacy of bigger government.    Superconductors are materials that conduct electricity with practically no loss of current. The materials formerly were impractical for most applications because they required extremely low temperatures to work. But in the past few years, scientists have discovered superconductors that work at higher -- though still frigid -- temperatures.    Boosters of superconductor technology say that some day it will be used to build superfast computers, floating trains and power lines that don't waste electricity. But experts sharply disagree about when laboratory advances will yield useful products.    The technology office's draft report concludes that Japanese companies are better positioned to commercialize superconductor technology because they believe it will lead to a plethora of products in the next decade. As a result, it says, they will consistently invest in product research, while U.S. companies are taking a &quot;wait-and-see attitude&quot; toward superconductor products. Japanese companies have the lead in developing superconductor-based trains and may well pull ahead in motors, the draft report says. It says the U.S. leads in medical equipment, though.    The report lauds the work of a few U.S. companies such as International Business Machines Corp. and American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Inc. But it says a dozen huge Japanese multinational manufacturers of such diverse products as glass, steel and electronics are pursuing superconductor research with an eye to marketplace applications. &quot;Japanese Randamp;D managers see HTS (high-temperature superconductors) as a truly revolutionary technology, one that promises radical change in their business,&quot; the report says. &quot;The skepticism common in the United States is nowhere to be found.&quot;    The technology office's report chides U.S. businesses for expecting the military to find the first applications of superconductor technology, which would then lead to commercial spin-offs. Superconductor products for the military will differ widely from likely commercial products, the report says. For instance, U.S. nuclear submarines want small high-speed generators, while commercial utilities want vast, relatively low-speed generators to power homes.    The draft report says a &quot;civilian technology agency&quot; could give non-defense companies a boost in exploring advanced technology. But it cautions that the agency could well become a captive of contractors looking to shift risk onto the government. Nevertheless, it says that without government help, superconductor technology could follow the pattern of the videocassette recorder: U.S. companies developed that technology, but Japanese companies built better products and made fortunes from them. </TEXT></DOC>
