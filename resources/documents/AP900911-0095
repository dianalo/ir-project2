GERANIOS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WAPATO, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Iraq's Saddam Hussein is a frequent topicof conversation at American Legion Post 133, where the talk is ashot as Old Glory on fire.   ``I think we should drop an atomic bomb on his doorstep,'' saidHaley Rhoden. ``I think we should get in there and whip them andget out.''   Others favored assassinating Saddam, whose soldiers invadedKuwait last month.   The Russell Barrett Legion Post has been in operation for 70years. It was named for a soldier killed in World War I.   It has 300 members, most of them World War II veterans.Legionnaires must have served in the military during wartime, andthe members here know the cost of war.   Near the entrance is a bronze plaque listing the town's WorldWar II dead, and a sheet of paper under glass listing the Vietnamdead. Each meeting ends with a 30-second pause to remember thedeparted.   This is a place where men brag about how many relatives havegone to war, where patriotism is fashionable, and where the word``peacenik'' is spat rather than spoken.   T-shirts for sale behind the bar feature an American flag andsay: ``Just Try To Burn This Flag.''   The legionnaires in this Yakima Valley farm town of 3,300 lookupon Saddam as a sort of ultimate flag-burner.   ``He appears to me to be a little Hitler,'' said Del St. George,an apple grower who served in the Navy in World War II.   ``I still have a boy who is 21, and grandsons coming up, and Idon't want to see those boys getting shot at,'' St. George said.``But if they stomp him quick it won't take that long.''   His opinions were shared by several legionnaires after a recentmonthly business meeting.   The men gathered in the dark bar, with its neon jukebox,television and games, were unanimous in their support of PresidentBush and the U.S. military effort against Iraq.   ``Most veterans would be supportive of what the president isdoing,'' said adjutant Jack Yearout. ``I would hope that theAmerican people would have the patriotism and guts to stand behindthe president.''   Yearout compared Saddam to Hitler or Stalin.   ``Anybody that would gas his own people and use gas against hisenemy in spite of the U.N. charter, has to be stopped,'' he said.   Ron Butler, a former policeman who is post commander, said theUnited States was morally obligated to support Kuwait.   ``We will lose men, no doubt, but they would be crazy to startactual combat with us,'' Butler said.   Farley Bennett, a Coast Guard veteran, said it is important forthe nation to make sacrifices to stop Saddam now.   ``I had two brothers in Korea and two sons and a brother inVietnam,'' Bennett said. ``We are hero-happy boys.   ``I don't think this is going to end without conflict. There aregoing to be some boys die on both sides, but at least we've gotworld support.''</TEXT></DOC>
