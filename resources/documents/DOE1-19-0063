The average {sup 18}F production rate for 60 runs was about720 {mu}Ci/{mu}A-min. A typical bombardment time of 20 min produced 120mCi of {sup 18}F-fluoride. [{sup 18}F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([{sup18}F]2FDG) was prepared using the procedure developed by Tewson [J. Nucl.Med. 24, 718 (1983)] involving a protected cyclic sulfate glucose derivativeas precursor. The routine synthesis and quality testing of [{sup 18}F]2FDGrequired 1 h and, typically, yields of 30-35 mCi of andgt;95% HPLC-pure productwere obtained.</TEXT></DOC>
