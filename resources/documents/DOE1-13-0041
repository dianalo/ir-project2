The reactivityof the films was tested for various treatments of reduction and oxidationfollowed by reduction. The latter treatment reduced the reactivity ofboth iron and nickel films. The carbon deposited as an intermediate inthe reaction was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and itsreactivity towards hydrogen was determined. These characteristics werecompared with those of carbon formed by decomposition of carbon monoxidein the absence of hydrogen. Examination by SEM showed no structure orother characteristics of deposited carbon on the films of either ironor nickel. The carbon formed during the reaction was somewhat more reactivetowards hydrogen than the carbon formed by decomposition of carbon monoxide.The reaction of H/sub 2/ + CO gave minor amounts of unsaturated hydrocarbons,but hydrogenation of the deposited carbon gave only saturated hydrocarbons.</TEXT></DOC>
