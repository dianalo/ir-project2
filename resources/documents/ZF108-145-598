 An authorization bill from theDoD calls for the creation of a critical technoogies panel to identifyproduct technologies considered important to the nation's future economicgrowth.andP;  An amendment to the 1980 Stevenson-Wydler Innovation Action focuseson building an information base on the competitiveness of various U.S.andO;industries.andP;  Also seeking to amend that act is a bill from the NationalInstitute of Standards and Technology that asks for the Commerce Secretary tosubmit to Congress an annual technology report that would include thenation's most economically crucial markets, products, and Randamp;D efforts.andM;JAPAN FIRMS UP...andP;  The positions of the top five companies in the computerindustry are likely to shift over the next five years as Japanese firmscontinue to gain ground.andP;  A new report by industry consultants Arthur D.andO;Little, Inc., Cambridge, Mass., ranks the world's 20 leading competitors inthe information systems and services industry in 1988 and projects theirpositions in 1993.andP;  Toshiba and Matsushita were added this year to the threeJapanese firms already on the top 20 list (Fujitsu, NEC, and Hitachi).andP;  IBMstill tops the list, with DEC second, Fujitsu moved up to three by pushingUnisys to fourth, while NEC came in fifth.andM;CENSUS CAT...andP;  A new digital map database has been developed by the U.S.andO;Geological Survey and the U.S.andP;  Census Bureau to automate the cartographicand geographic support processes for the 1990 census.andP;  The TopologicallyIntegrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) system will colect,tabulate and disseminate data taken from the nationwide survey which beginsin April.andP;  Using this information the bureau will be able to produce thefirst complete, largescale map set in U.S.andP;  history.andM;NSF TOTALS...andP;  Final appropriations for the National Science Foundation's FY1990 budget include $204 million for science and engineering education whichfigures a 19% increase over FY 1989 funds.andM;OUTSTANDING ACTS...andP;  The 10 greatest engineering achievements of the past 25years have been listed by the National Academy of Engineering.andP;  Touted astechnological breakthroughs that have dramatically changed society since1964, NAE kudos went to the moon landing; the microprocessor; computer-aideddesign and manufacturing; the CAT scan; application satellites; lasers; jumbojets; fiberoptic communications; advanced composite materials; andgenetically engineered products.andM;WEST COAST WIN...andP;  A coalition of California legislators, educators andbusiness leaders are hailing the passage of the Farr-Morgan-QuackenbushEducational Act (AB 1470) that will support programs aimed at bringing moderntechnology into the state's school system.andP;  The legislation provides $13.7million for implementing educational programs using computer networks,customized software, digita communications, interactive laser disks andtwo-way video programs.andM;DATA OUTDOES GNP...andP;  The information technology industry recorded a 9.4%average annual growth in revenue in the past decade, outpacing the overallU.S.andP;  economic growth rate of 7.5% per year.andP;  By year-end 1989, industryrevenue was estimated at $466 bilion, and expected to increase this year to$504 billion.andP;  According to new figures reeased by the Computer and BusinessEquipment Manufacturers Association, the software and services industry willcontinue to be the fastest growing sector with revenues up by almost 17% in1989 and projected to rise by 16% in 1990.andM;XEROX VS.andP;  APPLE...andP;  Apple Computer has denied allegations fied recently in asuit by Xerox Corporation challenging the validity of Apple's copyrights overthe Lisa and Macintosh computers' graphical user interfaces.andP;  The Xeroxcomplaint claims that the Lisa and Mac interfaces (introduced in 1983 and1984 respectively) unlawfully incorporate material developed by Xerox in thelate 1970s and early 1980s.andP;  Xerox is seeking to invalidate Apple's copyrightregistrations and is asking for $150 milion in royalties and damages; Applesays the claims are wihtout merit and plans to contest them in court.andM;SEA-TO-SEA PARTNERS...andP;  A strategic information center focusing on Japan hasopened in Washington, D.C.andP;  Built in partnership with Fuji and Xerox, SCANC2C provides U.S.andP;  industries, government and universities with timelyinformation, in English, from a range of key business, technical andscientific journals published in Japan.andP;  The center maintains over 140,000abstracts from more than 500 Japanese publications and will add 4,000 newabstracts each month.andP;  The firm also plans to provide on-line data; alongwith English language directories of Japanese businesses, researchlaboratories and science and technology experts.andM;BROMLEY SUPPORT...andP;  Amidst continued rumors that the White House wants to cutSematech's budget, the President's Science and Technology Advisor AllanBromley insists: &quot;I will do everything in my power to resist that.&quot;andM;GREENHOUSE REVISTED...andP;  A new computer simulation predicts that the NorthernHemisphere will endure significantly more heat than the Southern Hemisphereby the year 2030.andP;  The prediction seems to ease the most feared consequenceof the greenhouse effect: that the ice sheets of Antarctica would met andcontribute to rising sea levels.andP;  According to a recent article in Naturemagazine, the computer model is a new and improved version of previous modelsbecause it takes into account the ability of oceans to influence climate.andO;Although the simulation is more detailed, scientists warn there are stillmany unknowns accompanying these forecasts.andM;HIGH-TECH TOTS...andP;  Babies may be their business, but it's not their onlybusiness.andP;  These days Gerber Products is also pushing software programs thatallow technically happening parents to analyze junior's individualnutritional requests and growth milestones.andP;  A new $15 program includesfeatures like Feeding Baby and Baby's Daily Food Intake which enables parentsto evaluate baby's eating habits in relation to the U.S.andP;  Recommended DailyAllowances.andP;  A growth chart compares the infant's height and weight withgraphs from the National Center for Health Statistics.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
