Robert C. DiGennaro, former chairman and chief executive officer of Suffield Financial Corp., and Arthur Silverman, a stockbroker at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in Hartford, were indicted by a federal grand jury in New Haven, Conn., on a charge of insider trading related to Suffield, Conn.-based Suffield's acquisition of Portland, Maine-based Coastal Bancorp. The New Haven grand jury also charged the two with wire fraud and mail fraud.    In a separate grand jury indictment in Boston, the two men were charged with perjury and related offenses in connection with a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into the suspected insider trading.    The 40-year-old Mr. DiGennaro pleaded innocent to the perjury charges in federal court in Boston. Attorneys for both men said they will plead innocent to all the charges.    Suffield's acquisition of Coastal was announced July 9, 1986, but trading in Coastal's stock was unusually heavy on several days preceding the announcement. Before the agreement, which called for Coastal shareholders to be paid $40 a share, or about $52 million, in Suffield stock, Coastal's shares were trading at around $30. The merger was completed last year.    According to the indictments, Mr. DiGennaro in June 1986 tipped associates, including a building developer named Joel Weisman, to the confidential merger negotiations. Mr. Weisman is alleged to have passed the information to Mr. Silverman, 62 years old, who bought 1,200 shares for his and his family's accounts and recommended the stock to a colleague and clients, earning commissions on their trading. Mr. Weisman hasn't been charged, although he also bought shares in Coastal before the announcement, according to the indictments. Elliot Lobel, an attorney for Mr. Weisman, declined to comment on the indictments.    Frank L. McNamara Jr., U.S. attorney for Massachusetts, and Stanley A. Twardy Jr., U.S. attorney for Connecticut, said they expect the investigation to result in more charges. One person familiar with the case said as many as 20 people are under scrutiny, many of them residents of Suffield, a town of about 1,500 between Hartford and Springfield, Mass. Several of the people being investigated are likely to face civil and possibly criminal charges, he said.    The amounts of illegal profits are small by Wall Street standards. Mr. McNamara put the total earned by all participants in the alleged insider network in &quot;the midsix-figure&quot; range, with no individual having earned more than about $50,000. Mr. DiGennaro didn't buy Coastal shares himself, according to enforcement authorities, but did receive a share of the profits from others' trading.    Douglas Scarff, the SEC's regional administrator in Boston, said the indictments demonstrate that &quot;you don't have to be a New York arbitrager&quot; to be nabbed trading on inside information.    The Boston indictment charges Mr. DiGennaro, who resigned his Suffield posts last July after the investigations surfaced, with destroying documents called for by the SEC. People familiar with the case say this charge is based on an allegation that Mr. DiGennaro carted records to a yacht club, took them out on a boat and dumped them overboard. The indictment also charges Mr. DiGennaro with attempting to influence witnesses to falsify their testimony to the grand jury.    According to one person familiar with the investigation, federal authorities obtained some of the evidence by concealing a tape recorder on a cooperating suspect, who then met with Mr. DiGennaro and discussed certain details of the case.    Investigators said at a news conference that they are continuing to scrutinize trading in the stocks of other New England companies, most of them banks. </TEXT></DOC>
