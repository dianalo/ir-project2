He now can``talk'' to the world with a computer system developed to help LouGehrig's disease victims.   ``It was a godsend to us,'' said his wife, Debbie. ``A monthafter we got the computer, Monte lost his voice completely.''   Briner, 47, has amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which destroysnerve cells controlling almost every muscle within two to fiveyears while leaving a person's mental capacity intact. There is noknown cure.   Using Communi-Mate, Briner's eyebrow muscles send commands froma sweatband he wears 24 hours a day to the computer, which has amenu of over 2,000 words.   With it, he can write letters or talk to his daughters,Elizabeth, 5, and Emily, 9. More importantly, he can signal nursesin times of crisis.   ``It gives off an ear-piercing house alarm. He's set it offseveral times during the night. One particular time, it saved hislife,'' when it alerted people that a breathing tube wasdisconnected, Mrs. Briner said.   The former hospital executive, an excellent athlete, wasdiagnosed in 1984 and given no more than four years to live. As hiscondition deteriorated, his wife began to look around for some wayto communicate with her husband.   She settled on the 4-year-old system designed by Steve Wells andTim Ryan. It uses an Apple-compatible computer, printer, monitor,voice synthesizer and switches to control up to 250 householdappliances. It can be used by anyone who can move ``one-sixteenthof an inch anywhere on the body,'' Wells said.   Briner has developed a menu system of commonly used phrases andquestions, a medical menu and a sports and trivia file.   ``This is a breakthrough for patients who have no hope,'' saidWendy Fisher, executive director of the Les Turner ALS Foundation,which rents it for $25 a month. Sixteen other people are using thesystem, which costs $2,500.   ``People who had not been able to communicate were now all of asudden able to let their thoughts out,'' she said. ``They wereprisoners in their bodies.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Aug. 7</NOTE></DOC>
