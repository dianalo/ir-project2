Theshoe has a first surface adapted to connect to said well casing or drillstring, a second surface opposed to said first surface, an inside diameter,an outside diameter and a plurality of metallic protuberances (carbidebuttons) having cylindrical bases extending outwardly from said secondsurface. The bases are mounted in complementary recesses extending inwardlyfrom said second surface between said inside and outside diameters. Inoperation, the shoe is welded to the bottom of the first piece of wellcasing in order to protect the end of the casing as it is lowered throughthe ground. The casing shoe could also be attached to the well casingat other locations than on the bottom. For example, a casing shoe couldbe attached on the outside of the well casing with the carbide buttonsfacing upwardly. This would be useful if it was desired to remove thewell casing when necessary. In addition, the shoe could be used directlyon a drill string for drilling in some formations. Thus, a first shoecould be intalled on the lowermost piece of drill string and, if desired,a second shoe could be installed so as to aid when removing the drillstring from the hole. 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
