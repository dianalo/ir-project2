In addition, the company said its chief executive officer and two senior vice presidents resigned in a management shuffle that followed the acquisition, which was led by Forstmann Little andamp; Co., a New York-based investment firm that specializes in leveraged buyouts.    Lear Siegler Diversified Holdings Corp. said it named Richard W. Vieser as chairman, president and chief executive officer. Mr. Vieser, 59 years old, will succeed Norman A. Barkeley, 57, who Forstmann Little said resigned &quot;to pursue other interests.&quot;    In a Dec. 23 offering circular, the investment firm had indicated that Mr. Barkeley would continue as a president of Lear Siegler after the buyout. Mr. Barkeley wasn't available for comment.    The new company also named 52-year-old Robert A. Kenkel as executive vice president and to the new position of chief operating officer. Both Mr. Kenkel and Mr. Vieser formerly were executives of FL Industries, a unit of Forstmann Little.    The two senior vice presidents who resigned in the management shuffle are Ronald V. Paolucci, 60, and 54-year-old Laurence A. Thompson. They weren't available for comment.    Last week, Lear Siegler Holdings Corp., the parent of Lear Siegler Diversified, said it planned to sell the bulk of the company's large aerospace group as part of a number of divestitures, including its recreational and agricultural equipment businesses. The surviving entity, with interests in automotive and industrial businesses, &quot;probably was less interesting&quot; to Mr. Barkeley, said Theodore J. Forstmann, general partner of Forstmann Little.    Mr. Forstmann declined to give details of the settlements with the three former executives, but he said that &quot;it's a very amicable parting.&quot; He said the three, who &quot;kind of grew up together&quot; working in Lear Sieglar's aerospace unit, will retain &quot;a stock interest&quot; in Lear Siegler Holdings, but he wouldn't elaborate. </TEXT></DOC>
