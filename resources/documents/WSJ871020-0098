The camera and instant-film maker earned $24.4 million, or 39 cents a share, up 2.5% from $23.8 million, or 39 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $425.9 million from $396.2 million.    The third-quarter results represented a significant slowing of Polaroid's rebound in recent quarters from years of lackluster results. The company said sales of older consumer camera models fell in domestic and overseas markets. Moreover, Polaroid said its third-quarter tax rate increased to 35% from 21% from the year-earlier period.    Polaroid said, however, that third-quarter sales of its Spectra instant camera were higher than year-earlier sales. Unit sales of consumer film also rose, boosted partly by sales of film for Spectra cameras, the company added. I. MacAllister Booth, president and chief executive officer, said that the company's full-year results will be &quot;largely dependent on the upcoming holiday selling season.&quot;    In the nine months, net income rose 19% to $76.3 million, or $1.23 a share, from $64.1 million, or $1.04 a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 13% to $1.26 billion from $1.12 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
