The method is rapid, reproducible,and allows the efficient radioiodination of IL-2 to specific activitieshigher than those previously attained with full retention of biologicalactivity. IL-2 radioiodinated by this method binds with high affinityto receptors present on phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral bloodlymphocytes and should be useful for the study of receptor structureand function.</TEXT></DOC>
