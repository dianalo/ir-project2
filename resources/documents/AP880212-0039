(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Near blizzard conditions disruptedpresidential campaigns and almost brought the state to a haltFriday with up to two feet of snow predicted and winds gusting to60 mph.   ``It's terrible out there,'' state police dispatcher Norman St.Hilaire said Friday. Weir Lundstedt of the National Weather Servicein Concord added, ``It's not a day to go out and challenge thestorm.''   The weather played havoc with campaign schedules, as candidatesworked feverishly to win support before Tuesday's presidentialprimary.   Staff members scrambled to revise schedules as most candidateshad to scrap events. Several were having trouble flying in or outof the state, with airports closed. Bob Dole had planned to travelto New Orleans and Pat Robertson had hoped to go to Washington.Neither got out of the state.   Jesse Jackson and Albert Gore Jr., both in Virginia, and JackKemp, in Washington, were trying to get to New Hampshire.   Only Richard Gephardt had a campaign event made to order forsuch a day _ he was to watch a dog sled race at Opechee Park inLaconia.   The curtailed campaigning also put a crimp in news coverage.   Television crews covering Vice President George Bush, who washoled up in his hotel part of the day, dashed outside to film thestorm to show why candidates were notcampaigning.   The Weather Service predicted the storm should end aftermidnight.</TEXT></DOC>
