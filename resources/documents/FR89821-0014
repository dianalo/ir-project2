Hauser, Program Analyst,National Forest System, Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture,(202) 382-9346.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On January 23, 1989, at 54 FR 3342,part VI, the Secretary of Agriculture gave notice of adoption of two newrules that provide a process for appeal of decisions of Forest Serviceofficials related to management of the National Forest System. The newrules at 36 CFR part 251, subpart C, provide appeal procedures applicableto holders of or applicants for special use authorizations. New rules at36 CFR part 217 provide a new process for appeal of National Forest Systemplan and project decisions. The new rules replace the administrative appealprocedures at 36 CFR 211.18. Following publication, the Forest Servicediscovered several inconsistencies, typographical errors, and omissionsthat are being corrected by this rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="84">Technical Amendments to 36 CFR Part 217</ITAG>1. Section 217.3Section 217.3 describes the decisions arising from a National EnvironmentalPolicy Act (NEPA) evaluation, and documented in a Record of Decision, DecisionNotice, or Decision Memo that are appealable pursuant to this rule. Revisionis needed to correct a terminology problem with one of the decisions listedin paragraph (b)(3). The decision in question currently reads. ``* * *land exchanges and acquisitions, * * *'' Land exchanges involve both disposalof land and the acquisition of land, but it is disposal which inherentlyresults in environmental effects. Acquisitions merely involve transferof title. Environmental effects are likely to occur only when specificmanagement decisions are implemented concerning the acquired land. Accordingly,paragraph (b)(3) is revised to read, ``* * * conveyance of land or interestsin land out of Federal ownership, * * *''2. Section 217.4The final rule clearly establishes a review process applicable only todecisions arising from analysis required by the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act and subsequent implementing regulations and procedures documentedin a Record of Decision, Decision Notice, or Decision Memo. Accordingly,appeals of decisions not made through any of these three documents shallnot be accepted under 36 CFR part 217. However, while andSection; 217.11clearly defines the circumstances under which an appeal shall be dismissed,for example decisions excluded from appeal, paragraph (b) of andSection;217.4. Decisions not subject to appeal, conflicts with this direction.It states that a Reviewing Officer will ``not accept'' an appeal on subsequentimplementing actions. Therefore, paragraph (b) of andSection; 217.4 is beingrevised to say that appeals of subsequent implementing actions that resultfrom initial decisions subject to review will be dismissed. This revisionis consistent with the direction already set out in andSection; 217.11(a)(5).3. Section 217.7The proposed regulations published May 16, 1988 (53 FR 17310, Part II),stated the agency's intent to apply the same procedures described for first-levelappeals when the Secretary elects to review an initial decision of theChief. And, the final rule at andSection; 217.13(d) states that if the Secretaryelects to review an initial decision, the review shall be conducted inaccordance with the applicable rules and procedures of this part. However,andSection; 217.7(a) could be interpreted to contradict this direction becausethe citation refers only to special procedures involved in discretionaryreviews set forth at andSection; 217.17. To ensure that the intent of therule is achieved and that the Secretary's review of the Chief's initialdecisions follows first-level procedures, paragraph (d) of andSection; 217.13,which clearly stated the intent, is being moved to andSection; 217.7(a) andthe reference to andSection; 217.17 in andSection; 217.7(a) is being removed.Additionally, consistent with the notification procedures set out in andSection;217.17, new language has been added to andSection; 217.7(a) to clarify thatthe discretionary level will notify the appellants when the review at thislevel is not elected and that the Chief's decision is, therefore, the finaladministrative decision of the Department of Agriculture.4. Section 217.8 Part 217 established a review process applicable to all decisions arisingfrom analysis required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)and subsequent implementing regulations and procedures documented in aRecord of Decision, Decision Notice, or Decision Memo. Section 217.8, atparagraphs (a) (3) and (4), delineates the filing times for appeals, differentiatingbetween project decisions, and land and resource management plan approvals,significant amendments, or revisions. Inadvertently, the rule failed toaddress non-significant amendments to land and resource management plansor programmatic decisions made through an Environmental Assessment anddocumented in a Decision Notice. This omission has resulted in questionsas to whether or not these decisions are appealable and, if so, which filingtime applies. To cure the omission and uncertainty, andSection; 217.8(a)(3) is being amendedto provide a 45-day period for filing appeals of non-significant amendmentsto land and resource management plans documented in a Decision Notice orDecision Memo, or for filing appeals of programmatic decisions documentedin a Decision Notice. Neither a non-significant amendment nor a programmaticdecision analyzed in an Environmental Assessment and documented in a DecisionNotice are as complicated as land and resource management plan approvals,significant amendments, revisions, or other programmatic decisions documentedin a Record of Decision. Therefore, 45 days is sufficient time to filean appeal for these kinds of decisions. This change is wholly consistentwith the treatment of the 45/90-day period for filing appeals in the finalrule. The difference between significant and non-significant amendmentsto land and resource management plans is explained in Forest Service Manual1922.5 (51 FR 1476; 53 FR 26807). 5. Section 217.12 One of the fundamental features of the new procedures at part 217 is theemphasis the rules give to conflict resolution. The intent of the new rules,as stated in the preamble (54 FR 3351), is that the rule would allow DecidingOfficers, Reviewing Officers, appellants, or intervenors to request meetingsto resolve issues. However, through an oversight in andSection; 217.12(a),only Reviewing Officers are specifically authorized to initiate meetings.Therefore, this section is being amended to correct this oversight andconform to the stated intent. 6. Section 217.13 Reviewing Officers are permitted to extend the time periods for reviewto request additional information needed to clarify issues. However, andSection;217.13(c) limits this authority to the Secretary of Agriculture, Chief,and Regional Foresters in their capacity as Reviewing Officers. This limitationwas an oversight, as Forest Supervisors also need this latitude in firstlevel appeals of District Ranger decisions. Accordingly, andSection; 217.13(c)is being amended to give Forest Supervisors this authority in their capacityas Reviewing Officers.7. Section 217.15 Procedures for closing the record are set forth in the final rule at andSection;217.15(e). Paragraph (1) provides that the record will close ``* * * uponreceipt of comments on the appeal by the intervenor or at the end of the30-day period for providing comments, whichever is the latter date.'' Theintent of the rule was to close the record upon receipt of intervenor commentson the appeal but not later than the end of the 30-day period intervenorshave for providing comments. The rule as written is confusing. Accordingly,andSection; 217.15(e) is amended to clarify that the record closes upon receiptof comments from intervenors but not later than the end of the 30-day commentperiod. The final rule at andSection;  217.15 describes the appeal record. It clearlylays out what the record contains, who maintains it, and when it closes.And, andSection; 217.7 clearly states that, if the Secretary elects to reviewa Chief's initial decision, the first-level appeal procedures outlinedin this part apply. Some confusion exists, however, about the handlingof the appeal record in the interim, i.e., when an appeal is filed on aChief's initial decision but prior to the Secretary's determination. Becausethe creation of the official appeal record would not begin until the Secretaryhas made the decision to review an initial decision of the Chief (acceptedthe appeal), nothing filed by an appellant would constitute part of anadministrative appeal record until such a determination was made. Accordingly,to clarify this, andSection; 217.15 is revised by adding a new paragraphthat makes this point.8. Section 217.17 Based on inquiries from the public and Forest Service employees, thereappears to be some confusion in the new appeal regulation as to whethera Chief's discretionary review decision made pursuant to andSection; 217.17must be forwarded to the Secretary for possible further discretionary review.The intent of the final rule is clearly stated in the preamble discussionof levels of available review at 54 FR 3348, ``* * * the one-level reviewwith discretionary review at the second-level best fits the intent of therule. It simplifies the process, improves the potential to process appealsin a timely manner, yet retains the option for a second review.'' Therewas never any intention to offer a second level of discretionary review.Such a process would be inconsistent with the desire to streamline theappeals process. Accordingly, andSection; 217.7(e) is amended to make clearthat only one level of discretionary review exists. The intent of the final rule as discussed in the preamble is to providea discretionary review for appeal decisions rendered by the Regional Foresterand Chief. If discretionary review is exercised, the review is to be conductedsolely on the record used by the lower level Reviewing Officer. Paragraph(e) of andSection; 217.17 states that the record will not be reopened toaccept additional submissions from parties to the appeal or the ReviewingOfficer. This could lead one to conclude that a non-party could submitinformation to the record. This would be an erroneous conclusion basedon the stated intent of the discretionary review level. Accordingly, paragraph (e) of andSection; 217.17 is being revised to statethat the record shall not be reopened to accept additional submissionsfrom any source.9. Appendix Section 217.8(e) delineates how long the first-level review process shouldtake: 100 days for projects or 160 days for land and resource managementplans or programmatic decisions documented in a Record of Decision. AppendixA_a flow chart of the appeal process under part 217 which is not to beset out in the Code of Federal Regulations_was provided with the finalrule to assist the public in understanding the timeframes. Unfortunately,it was confusing. The total number of days shown on the schematic do notadd up to 100/160 days because (1) when the rule was finalized, mailingtimes were built in to the 100-/160-day timeframe; and (2) the schematicerroneously showed either 30 days or 90 days to make a decision after therecord closure. These timeframes were replaced in the final rule with the100-/160-day timeframe. Adding to the confusion over timeframes is an erroneousstatement in the preamble that the 90-day timeframe for review is retainedin the final rule (54 FR 3351). No changes in the rule itself are requiredto clarify the timeframes; however, correction of the chart is necessary.Accordingly, a revised Appendix A is published at the end of this rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="84">Technical Amendments to 36 CFR Part 251, Subpart C</ITAG>1. Section 251.82Review of andSection; 251.82, which lists the written decisions arising fromspecific types of permitted uses of National Forest System lands that canbe appealed, revealed that two of the decisions listed do not comport thepurpose and scope of 36 CFR part 251 and therefore should be deleted. Thetwo decisions in andSection; 251.82(a) are: Paragraph (9), ``Land exchangeagreements under 36 CFR 254.11 and decisions to proceed/not proceed withland exchanges''; and paragraph (13), ``Decisions to object, or not toobject to the issuance of minerals leases.'' In both cases the appealabledecision is documented in a NEPA-based document and therefore would beappealable pursuant to the procedures set forth in 36 CFR Part 217.Written agreements on a land exchange come after the actual decision pointto proceed or not to proceed and involve only an exchange of titles. Additionally,the decision to proceed/not proceed with land exchanges is accomplishedthrough a NEPA analysis documented in a Decision Notice or Rocord of Decisionand thus would be appealable pursuant to the procedures set forth in 36CFR part 217. There are occasions when the Forest Service solicits exchangepartners. In such instances, respondents (bidders) to the solicitationare not applying for written authorization to occupy and use National ForestSystem land. Therefore, no appeal rights under 36 CFR part 251 SubpartC exist for the unsuccessful bidder(s). However, an unsuccessful biddercould appeal pursuant to 36 CFR 217 when a Decision Notice is issued subsequently.If a land exchange decision affects a permit holder, the permit holderhas appeal rights pursuant to 36 CFR part 251, subpart C.Decisions to object/not object to the issuance of minerals leases are alsoaccomplished through a NEPA analysis documented in a Decision Notice orRecord of Decision and thus would be appealable pursuant to the proceduresset forth in 36 CFR part 217. Even though there are occasions where a personis entitled to apply for a mineral permit or lease and the Forest Servicehas authority to consent or not to consent to the permit or lease, thesedecisions are not appealable under 36 CFR part 251, Subpart C because thereis no current permit in effect and, therefore, no written authorizationestablishing a relationship that entitles a party to appeal, as requiredby 36 CFR 251.86(b); nor is the application the result of a Forest Servicesolicitation, as required by 36 CFR 251.86(a). Eligibility to appeal underthis rule is established when a permit or lease is issued which grantsauthority to the permittee or lessee to occupy and use NFS lands or whenan application is received in response to a Forest Service solicitation(36 CFR 251.86). The applicant for a Bureau of Land Management (BLM) permitor lease will have appeal rights under 36 CFR part 217, because the consentdecision forwarded to BLM is accomplished through NEPA analysis and documentedin a Record of Decision or Decision Notice.These changes do not eliminate a person's appeal opportunities. They simplyrealign them into the proper rule as outlined in the purpose and scopeof the respective rules: 36 CFR parts 217 and 251. Accordingly, the ruleis amended to reflect these two changes.2. Section 251.83The final rule at andSection; 251.83 lists those decisions not subject toappeal under this subpart. Paragraph (o) of that list reads ``Reaffirmationof prior decisions to terminate a special use authorization.'' This exclusionshould have read ``Reaffirmation of prior decisions.'' This limitationwas an oversight by the agency. Forest Service line officers can be askedto reconsider any decision concerning written authorizations to occupyand use NFS lands, not just decisions to terminate a special use authorization.That officer may review the decision to ensure its continued validity withoutopening the decision to appeal. If the reconsideration leads to a changein the original decision, the resulting changed decision would be appealable.If there is no change in the original decision, there is no action to appeal.And, if the officer refuses to reconsider a decision, the refusal is notappealable. If this were not the case, there could be no effective timelimit on the appealability of decisions. This change is consistent withlongstanding guidance in Forest Service Handbook 1509.12 (51 FR 10041).Accordingly, the rule is amended to reflect this change.3. Section 251.87Consistent with the revisions to andSection; 217.7 and the stated intentionof having the two rules consistent, as appropriate, andSection; 251.87(a)is being revised to make explicit that first level appeal procedures applywhen the Secretary elects to review appeals of initial decisions of theChief. Accordingly, paragraph (d) of andSection; 251.95 is being moved toandSection; 251.87(a), and the reference in andSection; 251.87 to andSection;251.100 is being removed.Consistent with the notification procedures set out in andSection; 251.100,language has been added in paragraph (a) of andSection; 251.87 to clarifythat the discretionary level will notify the appellants when the reviewat this level is not elected and that the Chief's decision is, therefore,the final administrative decision of the Department of Agriculture.4. Section 251.89The Reviewing Officer is given the discretion to extend most timelines.A contradiction could be construed when reading paragraph (b) of andSection;251.89 because it states that the Reviewing Officer may extend all othertimelines except for filing of a notice of appeal. However, paragraph (b)(2)of the same section states that a Reviewing Officer cannot extend the timeperiod for discretionary review. Therefore, to avoid confusion, paragraph(b) is being revised to bring those two limitations together in the sameparagraph. And, the citation to andSection; 251.87(d) in paragraph (b)(2)of andSection; 251.89 is being corrected to cite andSection; 251.100 whichis the section that describes the procedures for discretionary review.5. Section 251.93 Consistent with the stated intent of the rule, the Reviewing Officer hasthe discretion to extend the timelines to allow for conflict resolution.However, as noted previously, a Reviewing Officer cannot extend the timeperiods during discretionary review. To avoid any confusion and uncertainty,paragraph (b) andSection; 251.93 is being revised to clearly state that theauthority of the Reviewing Officer to extend time periods for review toallow for conduct of meaningful negotiations does not extend to the discretionaryreview level.6. Section 251.96The proposed rule stated that intervention would be limited to applicantsfor or holders of a written instrument. The discussion in the preamblestates that the final rule retains the language proposed. Paragraph (b)(2)of andSection; 251.96 states that in order to intervene, a party must beas defined at andSection; 251.81 ``* * * an applicant for or <T3>party </T3> to * * *'' [emphasis added]. Use of the words ``party to''is inconsistent with the preamble discussion and the definition at andSection;251.81. Therefore, the reference to ``party to'' in paragraph (b)(2) ofandSection; 251.96 is being changed to ``holder of'' to make it consistentwith the definition in andSection; 251.81.7. Section 251.98The final rule at andSection; 251.98 describes the appeal record. It clearlylays out what the record contains, who maintains it, and when it closes.And, andSection; 251.87 clearly states that if the Secretary elects to reviewa Chief's initial decision that the first level appeal procedures outlinedin this part apply. Some confusion exists, however, about the appeal recordin the interim, i.e., when an appeal is filed on a Chief's initial decisionbut prior to the Secretary's determination of whether or not to reviewa decision of the Chief. Because the creation of the official appeal recordwould not begin until the Secretary has made the decision to review aninitial decision of the Chief (accepted the appeal), nothing filed by anappellant would constitute part of an administrative appeal record untilsuch a determination was made. Accordingly, to clarify this and consistentwith a similar change in 36 CFR Part 217, andSection; 251.98 is revised byadding a new paragraph that makes this point.8. Section 251.99Whenever an appeal decision is made, the Reviewing Officer's decision mustbe consistent with applicable law, regulations, and orders. The final ruleat paragraph (a) of andSection; 251.99 includes the phrase ``* * * in effectat the time the decision was made.'' This was an error. The intent wasthat the Reviewing Officer's decision would be consistent with all applicablelaws, etc., not limited to only those in effect at the time the decisionwas made. Accordingly, paragraph (a) andSection; 251.99 is being revisedby deleting the phrase ``in effect at the time the decision was made.''This change is also consistent with the language currently in the correspondingsection of 36 CFR part 217. 9. Section 251.100The final rule sets out at andSection; 251.100 the procedures that will applyto discretionary reviews. However, it fails to state the responsible levelfor notification about discretionary review. Accordingly, paragraphs (c)and (g) of andSection; 251.100 are revised to say that the discretionaryreview level will notify. This revision is consistent with the notificationprocedures in the corresponding section of 36 CFR part 217. Also, in andSection;251.100, paragraph (d) states that the record will not be reopened to acceptadditional submissions parties to the appeal or the Reviewing Officer.This could lead one to conclude that a non-party could submit information.This was not the intent. It was intended that the discretionary reviewbe conducted on the same record used by the initial Reviewing Officer.Therefore, paragraph (d) of andSection; 251.100 is being revised to statethat the record shall not be reopened to accept additional submissionsfrom any source. This revision is consistent with a similar revision tothe corresponding section in 36 CFR part 217.<ITAG tagnum="84">Corrections</ITAG>Several typographical errors were found after publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> that cause confusion in the final rules. Errorsand corrections are as follows:1. In andSection; 217.4 Decisions not subject to appeal, paragraph (13) shouldread ``36 CFR 296.15 or violations,'' eliminating the phrase ``to issueorder;''2. In andSection; 217.8 Appeal process sequence, paragraph (a)(4) shouldread ``programmatic decisions'' instead of ``programmatic decision;''3. In andSection; 217.17 Discretionary review, the fifth sentence of paragraph(d) incorrectly reads ``* * * expiration of the 15-day period or the additional5-day period following receipt * * *'' It is being corrected to read ``** * or the additional 15-day period following receipt * * *.''4. In andSection; 251.82(a)(4), it should read ``Mining plans of operation''not ``mining plans of operating.''5. In andSection; 251.90(b)(6) the phrase ``that the appellant believes tobe violated'' appears twice. This paragraph is being corrected to removethe unnecessary verbiage.6. In andSection; 251.91 Stays, the first sentence of paragraph (j) incorrectlyreads `` * * * during the pendency of a stay.'' It is being corrected toread `` * * * during the pendency of an appeal.''The revisions in this rulemaking are technical corrections of errors andomissions and do not represent a change in agency policy or intended procedures.They are necessary to ensure that the rule is consistent with the statedintent and to eliminate confusion and ambiguity. Because of their technicalnature, this final rule will not have a significant effect on the humanenvironment, individually or cumulatively.<ITAG tagnum="84">Controlling Paperwork Burdens on the Public</ITAG>This rulemaking does not contain any recordkeeping or reporting requirementsor other information collection requirements as defined in 5 CFR part 1320and therefore imposes no paperwork burden on the public.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>36 CFR Part 217Administrative practice and procedure, National forests.36 CFR Part 251Administrative practice and procedure, Electric power, National forests,Public lands_rights-of-way, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Waterresources.Therefore, for the reasons set forth in the preamble, chapter II of title36 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 217_REQUESTING REVIEW OF NATIONAL FOREST PLANS AND PROJECT DECISIONS</ITAG>1.
