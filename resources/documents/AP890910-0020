In an August poll of 7,038 people by Gallup, voters listed astheir main concerns the pollution of Norway's unique fjords, arecord unemployment rate of 5 percent, and care for the aged.   Many voters feel the prime minister, of the socialist LaborParty, has not worked hard enough to clean up Norway's environment.They also say they have yet to feel the benefits of her economicausterity program.   Ironically, Mrs. Brundtland is known abroad as a champion ofconservation. She is chairman of the U.N. World Commission onEnvironment and Development, and foreign economists have praised herfor turning around an economy sinking deeply into debt.   About 3.2 million Norwegians in this Scandinavian nation of 4.2million are eligible to vote Monday for the 165-seat parliament orStorting, which has been expanded from 157 seats.   The elections come after a weekend suspension of campaigning tomourn 55 people, mostly Norwegians, who died Friday in a plane crashoff Denmark.   Analysts predict no clear majority will emerge in Monday'svoting. A large block of undecided voters, up to 20 percent, couldswing the outcome.   A poll published Saturday in Oslo's Aftenposten newspaperpredicted that Mrs. Brundtland's Labor Party will sink from 40.5percent of the vote in the 1985 election to 33.7 percent. Her partyhas governed with a parliamentary minority of 71 seats andissue-by-issue support from other smaller parties.   The poll also said the Conservatives, the leading oppositionparty, will drop from the 30.4 percent of the vote they garnered in1985 to 20 percent. It gave the right-wing Party of Progress 16percent and the rest of the votes to a variety of small parties.   Based on the poll, Aftenposten predicted 86 non-socialist seatsand 79 socialist seats in the new parliament.   The telephone poll of 1,215 voters was conducted Sept. 4-7 by theBergen survey institute Opinion A-S for Aftenposten. The margin oferror was 2.2 to 2.8 percent.   Pollster Hestetun said he believed `Mrs. Brundtland will resign,maybe not on the eve of the election but shortly afterwards and thata non-socialist coalition will take over.''   Mrs. Brundtland appeared to be recovering some lost supportSunday, analysts said. Her non-socialist opponents retained anapparent majority, they said, but it was possible deep rifts wouldprevent them from forming a working alliance.   Mrs. Brundtland, 50, a doctor and U.S-trained specialist inpublic health, became prime minister of a minority government forthe second time when a Conservative-led coalition resigned in 1986.   She has said a poor showing in Monday's vote will notautomatically force her to step down, since an alternative to aLabor government remains unclear.   Conservative Party leader Jan P. Syse, 58, is the most likelyalternative to Mrs. Brundtland. His party is allied with threesmaller non-socialist parties.   Syse has said Labor is ducking responsibility by blaming hisparty, and that ``socialism is bankrupt.'' But his party and itsallies have failed to find reach final accord on a candidate forprime minister or a common platform.   Christian Democratic chairman Kjell Magne Bondevik, a juniormember of the non-socialist alliance, has put himself forward as acompromise choice with some public support.   The wild card in Monday's election is Carl I. Hagen of theright-wing Party of Progress, who is challenging the underpinningsof the welfare state by urging sharp tax cuts and privatization ofstate-owned industries and services.   Hagen has been shunned by the other parties for a decade.Distaste for him could unify the other non-socialist parties enoughto overcome their differences and exclude him from government,analysts said.   Mrs. Brundtland has been accused of ignoring the goals of agovernment commission that drafted a 1987 environmental plan called``Our Common Future.'' She has rejected the criticism as unfairpoliticking by her rivals.   The international Organization of Economic Development andCooperation has credited Mrs. Brundtland for the austerity diet sheimposed on the economy, which had grown fat on North Sea oil wealthand then crashed with a price collapse in 1986.   Despite her political leanings, Mrs. Brundtland imposed wagerestrictions and other fiscal restraint that halved inflation in twoyears to under 5 percent and turned the foreign debt into a surplus.   However, unemployment and bankruptcies have hit record levels,giving a hollow ring to Labor's motto of ``Employment for All.''</TEXT></DOC>
