(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A ``supercomputer on a chip'' hailedby engineers as a technological marvel because it can be used as thebasis for a new generation of high-speed computers was formallyunveiled Monday by Intel Corp.   The i860 chip was touted at the company's headquarters as thefirst 64-bit microprocessor capable of performing operationstypically associated only with supercomputing systems andthree-dimensional graphics workstations.   The chip is crammed with more than a million transistors, nearlyfour times the number found on current microprocessors.   ``The level of integration and performance (the i860) providesputs supercomputing power in the hands of virtually anyone who canafford a desktop computer,'' said David L. House, Intel senior vicepresident and general manager of its microcomputer components group.   International Business Machines Corp. and Ing. Olivetti are among50 companies that have made commitments to use the i860, said ClaudeLeglise, marketing manager for Intel's microprocessor division.   The chip performs up to 80 million calculations per second and ispriced at $750. It operates on instructions that are as long asthose used in mainframe and supercomputers.   Intel last month said it would make the i860, which it initiallycalled the N-10, available as a helper chip as well as making itavailable to other companies as a central processor for engineeringand graphics workstations and multi-user computers.   As a helper chip, the i860 could handle the ``grunt work'' ofhigh-speed, repetitive calculations while a computer's mainprocessor handles more complex tasks.   That's a bold decision because it pits the chip againstestablished chips made by competititors such as Sun MicrosystemsInc., Mips Computers Systems Inc. and Motorola Inc.   Intel said the chip will be available by the third quarter of1989.   The i860 is built with so-called RISC technology, for reducedinstruction set computing. That means it cannot be used as a plug-inreplacement for the microprocessors used in industry-standardpersonal computers.   ``Getting IBM as a user is an important feather in their cap,''said Daniel Klesken, an analyst with Montgomery Securities in SanFrancisco. ``The RISC battle is heating up.''   RISC is important because it represents leading-edgesemiconductor technology, which is used in computer workstations,the fastest growing segment of the computer business. Workstationsare free-standing computers.   IBM will use the i860 in an add-on board for its latest personalcomputer line, called Micro Channel, while Olivetti plans to makethe chip the centerpiece of a new line of minicomputers.   Motorola on Tuesday plans to unveil its first computer systemsusing its own RISC chips. The systems, the Delta Series 8000, arebased on Motorola's 88000 RISC processor and offer performance thatranges from 17 million to 60 million instructions per second.   Intel said the i860 is ideal for computation-intensiveapplications and those requiring the interactive display ofthree-dimensional images, such as fluid dynamics, molecularmodeling, structural analysis and econometric modeling. The companysaid general business applications also will benefit because of theincomparable performance.   ``Until today, users basically had three choices if they wantedto perform these applications efficiently: They could share time ona multimillion-dollar supercomputer, if they could gain access toone; they could share time on a $500,000 minisupercomputer; or theycould use a less powerful, but more interactive $100,000 graphicssupercomputer,'' House said in a statement.   The United States continues to dominate in processor chips _ thebrains of computers _ even though Japan has taken over most of thework market for memory chips.   On Feb. 14, NEC Corp. and Hitachi Ltd. both announced high-speedmicroprocessors that they said were the fastest of their kind.   Hitachi's runs at up to 70 million instructions per second. Thecompany did not describe at the time what the chip could be used for.   NEC's V-70 runs at 10 million to 20 million instructions persecond and its V-80 runs at 15 million to 22 million instructionsper second. Those chips are mainly for telecommunications.</TEXT></DOC>
