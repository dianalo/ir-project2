Nearly 800 exhibitors, from AABE Fabrieken to Carl Zeiss,are occupying record amounts of space at the biennial show,which runs through Sunday at this airfield southwest ofLondon. Harrier jump jets and MiG-29 fighters are thrillingthe crowds. Huge aircraft orders are being announced, andmillions of pounds are being spent on catering in the poshhospitality chalets where the backslapping and barteringoccur.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;But this Iraqi business has affected the number of VIPvisitors,&quot; concedes Dan Honley, spokesman for the Society ofBritish Aerospace Companies, the show's organizer. &quot;Airlinepeople are here in force, but the defense procurement peoplefrom the Middle East are down. They don't want to leave theiroperations rooms.&quot;   Undertones of concern are hard to miss. General ElectricCo., the U.S. engine maker, concedes that it is facingcutbacks in its military programs. Roland Smith, the chairmanof British Aerospace PLC, allows as how the shape of thedefense industry is being re-examined in light of the Gulfcrisis. Officials of Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp.say the Mideast situation and fears of recession are causingsome airlines to hang back on ordering.   But Daniel M. Tellep, chairman of U.S. defense contractorLockheed Corp., is looking on the bright side, despite worldovercapacity for fighter-aircraft production. &quot;The Mideastthing has certainly shown that we need airlift,&quot; he says.&quot;And we will continue to rely on our strategic deterrent.&quot;   Here's what's up at the show:                                                                                                          Explosive lost-and-found: Security is tighter than usualat this year's show. Officials say undercover agents, snifferdogs and &quot;several hundred&quot; Ministry of Defense police arepatrolling, guided by intelligence reports from Scotland Yardand foreign governments. Briefcases are routinely checked atchalet entrances and the undercarriages of cars are inspectedon the way in. Woe to visitors who turn their backs on theirbags; police will blow them up in short order. A salesmanlost his samples that way earlier this week.                                                                                                          Live demonstrations: Farnborough may be big andwell-known, but the newish Dubai Air Show, the next of whichis scheduled for Jan. 27-31, will offer manufacturers thechance to really strut their stuff. The United Arab EmiratesMinistry of Defense will open a military base for livedemonstrations of missiles, tanks, armored personnel carriersand the like. Organizers say the expanded show already hasattracted 400 exhibitors from 40 countries. &quot;Manufacturersare crowding in,&quot; says a spokesman for the show. Due to theGulf situation, &quot;there is a major rush to get in.&quot;                                                                                                          Hungarian Generosity: Responding to pleas from Britain'sRoyal Air Force Benevolent Fund, Hungary's air force donateda mothballed MiG-21 PF fighter to the charity for its Battleof Britain Auction next Thursday. Also to be auctioned toraise money for RAF widows and orphans are a 1909 Bleriotbiplane, rides on Spitfires and World War II uniforms. TheHungarian MiG was to be handed over to the U.K. air forceyesterday at the air show.                                                                                                          Boys at play: The Rediffusion Simulation stand at the showis crowded, but not necessarily with people interesting inbuying a jetliner simulator. Men in suits and ties line upeach day to &quot;fly&quot; the Boeing 737-300.                                                                                                          Invisible Stealth: There had been much speculation thatthe U.S. Air Force would trot out one of its radar-eludingF-117A Stealth fighters. But no luck, even though the sleekblack bird has been displayed at other air shows. But builderLockheed, back after an eight-year absence, offers visitorsthe next best thing -- black plastic Stealth lapel pins.                                                                                                          Magnetic attraction: Speaking of giveaways, AirbusIndustrie came up with a novel gift -- a set of refrigeratormagnets in the shapes and colors of all its aircraft.                                                                                                          Profit prophets: Margaret Thatcher, visiting the Airbuspavilion, got the good news from Airbus Managing DirectorJean Pierson that the European jetliner consortium is poisedto make its first profit ever this year. The prime ministertartly replied, &quot;It's about time, too.&quot; British Aerospaceowns 20% of largely government-financed Airbus.                                                                                                          Sexual equality: For the first time in 29 Farnboroughshows, two female pilots are participating in the flyingdisplay. One is Natalya Sergeeva, a young Russian who pilotsa Sukhoi Su-26MX aerobatic plane. Ms. Sergeeva, the currentwomen's world aerobatic champion, wins gasps of approval fromthe knowledgeable, critical -- and mostly male -- audiencefor her speedy, precise flips and loops.                                                                                                          Supersonic washers: Along with his colleagues, BorisRakitin, chief designer of the Sukhoi Design Bureau inMoscow, has had a hand in the design of a number ofimpressive Soviet attack planes, including the Su-27 fighterthat wows the crowds here every afternoon. But the Sovietdefense industry, like its counterparts elsewhere, ischanging its focus. Mr. Rakitin says he and his co-workersare being required to design not only small, turboprop planesfor civilian use, but also washing machines. &quot;It's not soeasy to make a good washing machine,&quot; he says. &quot;There are thehydrodynamic processes. And you have to get the dirt toseparate from the clothes.&quot;                                                                                                          Running with the herd: Despite skyrocketing jet keroseneprices, the fuel-efficient propfan engine is a nonstarter.General Electric of the U.S., one of the leading developersof the technology, just couldn't drum up airline interestwhen fuel cost 60 cents a gallon, says Robert J. Conboy, a GEexecutive involved with the project. Airlines were afraid tobe different, he says, and they figured that if they orderedwhat everybody else was buying they would all be in the sameboat even if prices did go up. Now that fuel is at $1 agallon and rising, everybody's already ordered planesoutfitted with conventional jet engines. &quot;If we had stayedthe course, the engine would have been certified this year,&quot;says Mr. Conboy. &quot;We would have been heroes.&quot; And airlineswould have cut fuel bills by 30% to 40% on propfan-poweredplanes.                                                                                                          Missed opportunity: A search throughout the show's vastexhibit halls turns up nary a maker of gas masks. Somewhere,someone must be kicking himself.</TEXT></DOC>
