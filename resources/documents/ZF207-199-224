PhillipsandM;As commander of the Air Force Logistics Command's Logistics ManagementSystems Center, Brig.andP;  Gen.andP;  John F. Phillips keeps tabs on the service's$1.7 billion Logistics Management Systems (LMS) modernization program.andP;  LMSconsists of nine interconnected subsystems that will do the work nowperformed by 380 existing logistics systems, Phillips said.andM;Although the modernization is the focus of Phillips' energies, his concernsare much broader.andP;  Last year, when Phillips took command of the center, healso was appointed chief of staff of communications-computer systems at AFLCheadquarters at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Fairborn, Ohio.andP;  Theposition gave Phillips responsibility for all AFLC communications andcomputer operations.andM;Phillips, 46, served as vice commander of the Air Force for research,development and logistics.andP;  He said he also served as a logistics systemsanalyst in Tehran, Iran, until he was &quot;politely asked to leave&quot; by theKhomeini regime.andM;GCN staff writer Brad Bass interviewed Phillips during one of the general'srecent visits to the Pentagon.andM;GCN: As the head of computers and communications at AFLC, what are yourprincipal duties?andM;PHILLIPS: My primary duty is to bring on a rather large computer supportinfrastructure we call LMS [Logistics Management Systems modernizationprogram] ...andP;  to completely update the old 1960s-technology decision-supportcomputer base.andM;We have four core functions in Air Force logistics: To determine what itemsto buy -- we refer to that as the requirement.andP;  Once we've determined that,we must go out and acquire it -- acquisition.andP;  Once we've done that, we'vegot to distribute -- stock, store and issue.andP;  Once we've done that, we've gotto maintain it.andP;  So those are our four basic core functions.andM;We are moving toward an almost paperless environment in, as an example, theworld of purchase requests.andP;  We expect to complete this effort by themid-1990s.andP;  That's not to say that we are not incrementally distributing somecapability as we proceed down this rather long protracted path.andP;  We'vedivided it up into bite-size bits such that we will test, analyze andimplement a functional module and move on to the next one.andM;For example, final operational capability of one of our largest systems, theRequirements Data Bank, will not be realized until 1994.andP;  But as we speak, we[at AFLC] have already delivered 34 percent of the functionality of thatsystem.andM;GCN: Your predecessor, Maj.andP;  Gen.andP;  James W. Hopp, said he expected all of thesystems to be fully operational by 1990.andM;PHILLIPS: That is still our target goal.andP;  Bear in mind we are alwaysperturbed by budget cuts, should there be any.andP;  We must take our fair shareof the cuts.andP;  And the notion there is balance.andP;  We are still targeted to fulloperational capabilities in the early 1990s.andM;GCN: It's a huge undertaking, isn't it?andM;PHILLIPS: Tremendously large.andP;  We're talking about perhaps 22 million linesof code.andM;GCN: How many subsystems?andM;PHILLIPS: Let me define that with the number of existing data systems we aregoing to be subsuming.andM;We've got about 380 current systems we are going to subsume in this system wecall LMS.andP;  LMS itself has nine major programs.andP;  And of course each of thoseprograms is incrementally developed so we have subsets and functional modulesof each of those nine major programs.andM;As an example, the Requirements Data Bank has 65 modules.andP;  Those are actuallydeliverable products.andM;GCN: You mentioned budgets might be a problem.andP;  Do you think funding in thefuture might hinge upon you competing with, for example, a big weapons systemfor money?andM;PHILLIPS: I think it's fair to say that.andP;  I like to use the term &quot;balance.&quot;andO;It would serve no useful purpose for us to develop a system if in fact wedon't have all the spares and support equipment that essentially we aredesigned to track.andP;  The powers-that-be here are the guardians of that balanceso that any cuts that we receive would probably be proportionate to thespares funding level.andM;GCN: What experience do you bring to the LMS program?andM;PHILLIPS: I guess my experience really started back in 1979 when I was in theaircraft acquisition business.andP;  There is some commonality whether you areacquiring aircraft systems or whether you are acquiring computer systems.andO;The acquisition process has some basic elements that stand firm regardless ofwhat you buy.andP;  I also have studied computers in graduate school.andP;  But moreimportant, I've been the understudy for two years in the LMS modernizationprogram.andP;  The continuity is certainly there.andM;GCN: Did Gen.andP;  Hopp offer any advice to you as you were coming in?andM;PHILLIPS: Yes, as a matter of fact.andP;  His management style was such that weshared data continuously.andP;  I knew exactly what he was doing, and he was verymuch aware of what I was doing.andP;  Our offices were adjacent to each other.andM;He advised me on such things as maintaining the target operating environment,moving toward an integrated whole and making sure we continue to recruit theright kinds and number of people.andP;  That sounds awful trite, but it is verydifficult competing with industry to get the kinds of military and civilianpeople in the Air Force that have the knowledge to operate in a veryhigh-tech environment.andM;GCN: What do you do besides manage LMS?andM;PHILLIPS: Our four-star [Gen.andP;  Alfred G. Hansen, AFLC commander] has launcheda campaign we refer to as seamless logistics to reach out beyond the AirForce Logistics Command and try to make sure that once we have delivered aproduct, ...andP;  we track it all the way through to the units out in the fields.andO;It should be a seamless effort.andP;  So we have several projects going in whichwe are trying to make sure we've got the proper interfaces down at the base-and squadron-level.andP;  We are concerned not just with our own unique AFLCenvironment but with the Air Force environment as a whole.andM;GCN: When you talk about delivering products, do you mean spare parts?andM;PHILLIPS: That's right.andP;  And I use the term seamless logistics as theprecursor to the real code name, which is Pacer Connect.andM;GCN: So when a spare part goes out, you want to track it through its entirelife cycle?andM;PHILLIPS: That's correct.andP;  Down to the aircraft and back to the depot shouldit fail and have to be repaired.andP;  Not only spare parts but also the supportequipment.andP;  We have launched a program we call the Air Force EquipmentManagement System, in which we will actually have locations out at thesquadrons.andP;  We will also have locations for our Air Force technical ordermanagement systems out at the squadron level, at 167 bases.andM;GCN: How much emphasis will you place on artificial intelligence inlogistics?andM;PHILLIPS: We are placing quite a bit, as a matter of fact.andP;  One of theinteresting things in the AI arena is finding the expert from which you canmodel and decide what the decision routes are.andM;And we have an organization whose sole function is to do just that.andP;  And aswe are able to define the operational parameters and decision routes, we areincorporating those in our LMS programs.andM;GCN: What do you see as some of the major trends in logistics?andM;PHILLIPS: The major trend I see is the almost exponential use of computers.andO;I mentioned earlier we would have essentially a paperless purchase requestingenvironment in which the manual intervention was slim to none.andP;  That's amajor change.andP;  As an example, we have people whose sole function is to loadtapes.andP;  We're moving out of that environment into an on-line environment.andP;  Sotape hangers will become an extinct breed.andM;Automation has with it the requirement for new and different jobs.andP;  As anexample, those people who were tape hangers will now become databaseadministrators.andP;  We have not had the requirement for that in the past to anylarge degree.andP;  So technology generates kind of a requirement for a new breedof cow.andM;GCN: What are the major challenges facing people in logistics?andM;PHILLIPS: Of the nine major programs we are developing, each of them wascompeted separately.andP;  We are going to have to integrate this entire effort.andO;And from a single terminal, one person will have access to this heterogeneousenvironment.andP;  So one of my biggest challenges is to try to integrate all ofthat.andP;  We are doing that by defining our target operating environment interms of operating system software and those kinds of things that would steerus toward an ultimately integrated system.andM;GCN: So it involves the development of standards and protocols?andM;PHILLIPS: Yes.andP;  We're very active with the National Institute of Standardsand Technology and we are also reaching out to the other services.andP;  We areworking with the Navy on one of their programs called EDMICS [EngineeringData Management Information Control System] in which we are trying to definea compression algorithm for facsimile transmission.andM;GCN: Are you involved in the Computer-Aided Acquisition and Logistics Support[CALS] program?andM;PHILLIPS: Absolutely.andP;  CALS is an active part of a program we will be goingunder contract for in the next year or so called the Air Force TechnicalOrder Management System.andP;  That effort will be heavily dependent upon CALS.andM;GCN: Is there a lot of give-and-take involved when you are trying to set upstandards and protocols with the other services, the Office of the Secretaryof Defense and vendors?andM;PHILLIPS: Without a doubt.andP;  To get everybody to march in step is a bit of atrick.andP;  But we are getting there.andP;  We have, as an example, just come up witha standard for digitized data we call Mil-Std 1840.andP;  That's certainly apositive step, and there are other efforts like that which are successstories.andP;  It's not that people don't recognize the need for it, it's thatmany systems have already been defined.andP;  It becomes a matter of economics asto whose systems will be modified to make sure we have complied with thestandard.andM;GCN: Will the AFLC use the standard DOD minicomputers being purchased fromATandamp;T?andM;PHILLIPS: To some degree they will, but not to a great extent.andP;  But what itportends for us is to make sure that in our target architecture, we arecompatible with that system.andP;  And we are currently.andP;  Again that supports thenotion of the Pacer Connect or the seamless logistics issue.andP;  The systems weare bringing on must be interoperable at some point in time with thosesystems and we have defined our architecture so that they are.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
