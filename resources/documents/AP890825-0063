(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former PTL vice president Richard Dortchsaid he was humiliated by his actions that resulted in an eight-yearprison sentence and a $200,000 fine.   ``I failed my master, failed my family and failed myself,'' saidDortch, as he pleaded for mercy at his sentencing Thursday.   Dortch's sentence was part of a plea agreement in exchange fortestimony against Jim Bakker, founder of the television ministry,whose trial on the same fraud and conspiracy charges starts Monday.   ``I could not believe that I participated in this ... indeceiving people, in doing something I knew was wrong,'' Dortch saidafter prosecutors showed the judge charts detailing a pattern offinancial manipulations at PTL. ``The shame of that was the mosthumiliating thing I have ever known.''   Prosecutor Deborah Smith said memos between Dortch and the PTLfinancial office showed calculated attempts to hide PTL's financialdifficulties.   ``The victims in this case are in the thousands,'' she said.``They are waiting to see the court's assessments. They are waitingfor justice.''   Dortch, Bakker's top assistant at PTL, pleaded guilty earlierthis month to four counts of conspiracy and fraud and agreed totestify against Bakker. Bakker is charged with using ministry fundsto finance his opulent lifestyle, including expensive homes, carsand an air-conditioned dog house.   Dortch is the third former Bakker aide to be convicted. Formeraides James and David Taggart, were convicted of evading taxes on$1.1 million in ministry funds that prosecutors said they used tobuy Cartier jewelry, designer clothes and a Manhattan apartment.They will be sentenced Sept. 8.   Thursday, prosecutors presented evidence that even though Dortchand Bakker said there would be a limit of 30,000 ``lifetimepartnerships'' sold in the Towers Hotel at PTL's Heritage USAreligious theme park, 68,755 partnerships were sold.   Lifetime partners made a one-time donation of $1,000 in exchangefor three nights' free lodging each year for life, but the TowersHotel and other hotels planned for Heritage USA were never built orwere left uncompleted.   Prosecutors said the Towers project alone generated $74.2 millionbut only $11.4 million was spent on the uncompleted facility.   The indictment alleges that the PTL executives spent more than $4million on themselves and used some of it for operating expenses.   The charts showed that Dortch collected $1,128,735 in salaries,bonuses and tax-deferred retirement payments between January 1984and June 1987. The bonuses alone in those three years amounted to$550,000.   Investigators also said that Dortch lived rent-free in aPTL-owned home valued at $400,000 and that he had asked PTL'sbuilder to ``bury'' $233,000 in parsonage renovations in theconstruction account for the Towers Hotel project.   Dortch didn't attempt to blame Bakker.   ``I lost the thing that I lived for _ my ministry,'' he said, hisvoice cracking, before he was sentenced.   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter gave Dortch four years inprison and a $100,000 fine on the wire fraud charge, and four yearsin prison and a $100,000 fine on the conspiracy. The prison termswere consecutive.</TEXT></DOC>
