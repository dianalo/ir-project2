The presentregulations are codified in 34 CFR Part 319. These proposed regulationsare needed to implement amendments made to section 632 of the EHA by PublicLaw 100-630, section 104 (November 7, 1988). Section 632 authorizes grantsto State educational agencies (SEAs) and institutions of higher education(IHEs). The intended effort of these proposed regulations is to clarifythe statutory requirements and to improve the operation of the program.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be received on or before September 21, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Comments concerning these proposed regulations shouldbe addressed to Dr. Norman Howe, Division of Personnel Preparation, Officeof Special Education Programs, Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue,SW.

Section 631 creates three specific subprograms, providing for grantsto (1) nonprofit organizations for parent training and information, (2)IHEs and nonprofit organizations for training personnel for careers inspecial education and early intervention, and (3) IHEs, nonprofit organizations,and State agencies for special projects. Section 632 provides for grantsto SEAs and IHEs, for preservice and inservice personnel training.Under section 632 as amended in 1988, the Secretary is directed to makea grant of ``sufficient size and scope'' to each SEA for the purpose ofassisting States in establishing and maintaining preservice and inserviceprograms to prepare personnel to meet the needs of handicapped infants,toddlers, children, and youth or supervisors of those persons, consistentwith the personnel needs identified in the State's comprehensive systemof personnel development under sections 613 and 676(b)(8).The Secretary proposes to change the basic method for the allocation ofthese funds. In previous years, funds under this program have been awardedbased on the applicant's need and on the quality of the grant applicationwithin a narrow range of funding. This method did not take into considerationthe varying personnel training needs of States based on their populationof students with handicaps.The regulations propose that States henceforth will be awarded funds basedon their proportionate share of the national ``annual child count'', i.e,the count of students receiving a free appropriate public education requiredunder Part B of the EHA and Chapter 1 of Title I of the Elementary andSecondary Education Act of 1965 as amended by Public Law 100-297. Limitedadditional funds will be awarded for quality of the application (qualityincentive funds). Moreover, the 1988 amendments provide that in any Statein which the SEA does not apply for such a grant, any IHE within that Statemay apply for that grant. If any SEA chooses not to apply for any Stategrant award, it must notify all IHEs within the State of this decisionone month prior to the competition closing date.The Secretary may also make a limited number of awards to SEAs on a competitivebasis.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>These regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order12291.

The objective of the Executive orderis to foster an intergovernmental partnership and a strengthened federalismby relying on processes developed by State and local governments for coordinationand review of proposed Federal financial assistance.In accordance with the order, this document is intended to provide earlynotification of the Department's specific plans and actions for this program.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification</ITAG>The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations will not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities becausethe regulations would not impose excessive regulatory burdens or requireunnecessary Federal supervision. The regulations would impose minimal requirementsto ensure the proper expenditure of program funds.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980</ITAG>Sections 319.20, 319.22 and 319.33 contain information collection requirements.As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)),the Department of Education will submit a copy of these proposed regulationsto the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review. Organizationsand individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collectionrequirements should direct them to the Office of Information and RegulatoryAffairs, OMB, Room 3002, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC20503; Attention: James D.
