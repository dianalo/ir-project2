One suspect in the bungled, mob-linked assassination attempt onNicodemo Scarfo Jr. is Steven Vento Jr., 21, his attorney said. Twosources, who refused to be identified by name, said there are threesuspects in the machine-pistol shooting Halloween night at arestaurant.   ``My client is innocent, and I advised him to take a liedetector test to prove it because his life is in danger,'' said A.Charles Peruto Jr., representing Vento.   ``He is not involved. He was dining in a restaurant a blockaway. The idea that he would do this one week after getting out ofjail is absurd. I'm afraid somebody's going to kill him,'' Perutosaid. ``In my law career I have never advised any client to giveany statement of any kind, but this is a different case because itinvolves a person's life.''   Vento became ``possibly the No. 1 suspect,'' Peruto said,because he was involved in a drug dispute with the Scarfo familyseveral years ago.   The several bullets that struck the 24-year-old Scarfo justmissed the heart and other vital organs. He is expected to bereleased next week from Thomas Jefferson University Hospital.   While the victim reportedly is declining to cooperate withauthorities, police appeared uncertain whether the shooting waslocally inspired or ordered by New York gangsters seeking to takecontrol of the mob here, and its lucrative casino territory innearby Atlantic City, N.J.   ``It's still speculative at this stage, and there are severaltheories,'' said Joel Friedman, head of the Justice Department'sOrganized Crime Strike Force in eastern Pennsylvania.   ``One, obviously, is that it is a local hit, and the otherindicates it could have been from New York. It's too early to drawany final conclusions, and you just can't rule out a possible NewYork connection and their efforts to fill the vacuum,'' he said.   That vacuum was created when Friedman's prosecutorial teamconvicted the elder Scarfo and 15 of his mobsters last year onracketeering charges that included murder, extortion, drug dealingand illegal gambling.   All are serving long prison terms with Scarfo getting thestiffest, 55 years. Scarfo also has a 14-year federal extortionsentence plus a life term for a Philadelphia murder, making itunlikely he'll ever be free again.</TEXT></DOC>
