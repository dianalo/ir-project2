The justices, by a 7-1 vote, ruled that the federal law enactedto discourage tax evasion in the trading of municipal bonds doesnot violate any state's sovereign immunity.   South Carolina had challenged the law, arguing that the law willhurt state and local governments by forcing them to chose betweentwo costly alternatives: Continue to issue unregistered bonds forwhich investors will have their interest taxed or pay sizeableregistration fees.   State and local governments issue bonds to finance variousprojects such as building roads and schools.   More than half the states had supported South Carolina'schallenge.   The law, which took effect July 1, 1983, is aimed in part atdiscouraging tax evasion when bonds change hands as gifts or arepassed on to an heir. While the interest on government bonds isexempt from federal income tax, the bonds are taxed as gifts or aspart of an estate.   In passing the law, Congress mainly intended to crack down onthe use of such bonds as an untraceable substitute for cash inillegal activities, and to make it easier to catch criminals whodeal in stolen or forged securities.   Writing for the court today, Justice William J. Brennan said,``A nondiscriminatory federal tax on the interest earned on statebonds does not violate the intergovernmental tax immunitydoctrine.''   Only Justice Sandra Day O'Connor dissented, accusing the courtof overturning ``a precedent that it has honored for nearly ahundred years'' by making state and municipal bonds subject topossible federal taxation.   ``Henceforth the ability of state and local governments tofinance their activities will depend in part on whether Congressvoluntarily abstains from tapping this permissible source ofadditional income-tax revenue.''   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy did not participate in the case,which is called South Carolina vs. Baker, 94 Original.</TEXT></DOC>
