The NRC said the uranium concentration created thepotential for a &quot;localized&quot; safety problem. The agency saidthere was a &quot;low potential&quot; for a critical reaction orspontaneous fission until the uranium concentration in thesolution was reduced. It said the problem was caused by amalfunction in a solvent extraction system.</LP><TEXT>   A spokesman for the Fairfield, Conn., manufacturer saidnothing was released to the environment and that the planthas initiated measures to extract uranium from the solution.The plant processes uranium into fuel for commercial nuclearplants.</TEXT></DOC>
