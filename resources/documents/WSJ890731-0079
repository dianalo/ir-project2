President Bush should indeed veto the mess, sending both Congress and the Treasury back to get something that will solve the problems that made the bailout necessary.    On the narrow financing issue, Treasury Secretary Brady wants the new Resolution Funding Corp. (RefCorp.) to be a &quot;government-sponsored enterprise&quot; (GSE), raising its proposed $50 billion to clean up the wreckage outside the federal budget. Conferees instead bought the Democratic proposal to put the $50 billion on budget over three years but left outside the Gramm-Rudman deficit limits. The Democrats argue that off-budget financing would cost more, but Mr. Brady surely is right that they're also seeking a precedent for sneaking other spending outside the Gramm-Rudman restrictions. The ultimate agenda here is an effort to break George Bush's no-tax resolve.    The Treasury, though, has not been entirely forthright either. It insists that RefCorp. will not be open-ended like Ginnie Mae and the other GSEs that have so rapidly expanded taxpayer credit-risk exposures. However, it's closed-ended only if you believe that $50 billion will handle the cleanup, and no one much believes that. Moreover, the Treasury likes to say that the industry itself will be responsible for the $50 billion principal, whereas taxpayers will pay only the interest. In fact, the industry's contribution will be a few billions to buy zero-coupon Treasury bonds, which will mushroom to $50 billion over 30 years or so. Will redemption of those bonds by the Treasury truly represent &quot;industry financing&quot;?    Some bookkeeping legerdemain would be forgivable if the bill actually did anything to prevent another Sandamp;L mess. But to regard its &quot;tougher&quot; capital requirements as a deterrent to misdeeds, you have to agree that the initial standard -- 1.5% of assets and an ability to count mortgage-service contracts and good will as &quot;capital&quot;is in fact &quot;tough.&quot; To believe that regulation is going to have more muscle, you have to ask then why the conference, after an hour's debate, agreed to retain as a top regulator Danny Wall, who was minding the store when all the merchandise was being shoplifted. The reason was his support by Senator Alan Cranston, who provided the key vote on the funding issue, and who was one of five Senators leaning on regulators to go easy on the now-bankrupt Lincoln Savings andamp; Loan.    Congress also added some truly ludicrous provisions, products of Washington mysticism. Thrifts must cut back holdings of high-yield bonds -- eventually to zero, though diversification is the essence of safety. In any event, junk bonds are pure gold compared with some of the development schemes they were investing in. The thrift industry also will have to put more money into &quot;low-cost&quot; housing. So we &quot;help&quot; sick thrifts by making it tougher for them to make money.    Somehow Washington has spent months on the Sandamp;L bailout without even addressing the issue of what caused the problem, let alone how to solve it. The thrifts had an undiversified portfolio of fixed-rate mortgage loans, but could lend long and borrow short because of the advantage Uncle Sam gave them over banks in a regime of regulated interest rates. The onset of inflation undermined this cozy business, spurring money-market funds and other instruments that paid savers what their deposits were worth. This threatened to drain the thrifts dry unless they were deregulated and allowed to pay market interest rates.    If thrifts had to pay more interest, obviously they had to earn more on their investments. So they plunged into risky investments, principally commercial real-estate development. Real-estate developers around the country recognized their piggy banks, and had the political clout to move Congress. So Rep. Fernand St Germain boosted deposit insurance to $100,000, creating a whole new industry of brokered deposits.    With taxpayers taking all the risk, the greater a thrift's irresponsibility the greater its potential rewards. And Rep. Jim Wright, Senator Cranston and others leaned on regulators to make sure they didn't clip the wings of highfliers. So taxpayers are stuck with a $250 billion cleanup cost, enough money to finance capital improvements for the nation's public schools for the next 20 years.    The quick solution to the Sandamp;L problem would be to start withdrawing federal backing for deposits. This need not hurt the &quot;small savers&quot; wept over by politicians. Small savers don't maintain multiple accounts of $100,000 each. But it certainly would make it harder for Sandamp;Ls to get easy money, and thus harder for developers to use thrifts as piggy banks. That's why it isn't in the bill. Surely it's clear by now that the real problem lies in the political system.    But Congress, with little serious resistance from the Bush administration, is doing once more what it did in thrift-reform bills in 1980, 1982 and 1987: pretending to solve the problem while pouring yet more money into the trough. What we have here is merely a bailout, not a fix. It deserves not only a veto but also a trip back to the drawing boards. </TEXT></DOC>
