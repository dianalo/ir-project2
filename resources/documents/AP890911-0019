They began driving across the border at midnight as Hungary,ending a weeks-long diplomatic stalemate, removed the frontierbarriers to allow more than 7,000 East German refugees to escape tothe West.   The largest mass emigration of East Germans to West Germany sincethe Berlin Wall went up in 1961 began after Hungary announced Sundayevening that it would allow them to leave for West Germany, theirfinal destination.   The first East German cars arrived in Passau, a West German cityon the Austrian border, nine hours later. Most carried young couplesor families with babies or toddlers.   Some refugees said they were heading for one of several nearbytent communities set up more than a week ago by West German RedCross workers. Others planned to seek shelter with relatives as faraway as Hamburg.   Hungary on Sunday became the first East bloc government to helpthe citizens of another Communist country freely leave theirhomeland, for which East Germany promptly accused Budapest of``directly interfering'' in its internal affairs.   ``The Hungarian government has chosen to illegally allow EastGerman citizens to travel to West Germany in violation ofinternational treaty,'' the state-run news agency ADN said.   It said Hungary, ``under the guise of humanitarianism, hasengaged in the organized smuggling of human beings.''   West Germany, which offers East Germans automatic citizenship andhelp getting settled, said Hungary made a ``humanitarian'' decision.It had refugee camps set up in Bavaria just over a week ago tohandle the expected influx.   At this frontier town 120 miles northwest of the Hungariancapital, border guards gave only cursory checks to East Germans.   As the first groups crossed, hundreds of others waited in theircars, forming growing lines at the main border crossings.   And as the first convoys made they way across the border, newEast German arrivals were reported by Hungarian and West Germanvolunteers at several Hungarian camps used to house and marshall therefugees since mid-August.   An estimated 60,000 East Germans were in Hungary when the exodusbegan.   Eight of 18 lanes at the Hegyeshalom crossing were open as thejubilant East Germans drove through. They honked their horns,cheered and whistled, releasing emotions pent up by days and weeksof waiting for a decision by Hungarian authorities.   Some refugees waved bottles of foaming champagne from the carwindows.   Austrian customs officials said more than 2,000 East Germans incars had crossed into Austria over six entry points in the firstfive hours of the mass exodus. Others arrived at the border by busand train.   ``It's wonderful, it's terrific,'' refugees shouted to reportersand border guards. One man, overcome with emotion, tried to smile astears rolled down his cheeks and couldn't speak.   Dozens of people who had taken taxis from Budapest waited tocross into Austria on foot. A group of youths among them held up asign saying, ``Give it up Erich!'' referring to East GermanCommunist leader Erich Honecker.   Once on the Austrian side of the massive border barrier, manyEast Germans jumped from their cars and danced with joy.   In a small tent on the Austrian side, Red Cross workers handedout steaming cups of tea, crackers and maps showing the quickest wayto the West German border to anyone who asked.   Crowds of Austrians gathered to welcome the emigres, cheering andclapping as each car passed. A woman stood at the roadside holdingup a sign offering free beds for a refugee family with children.   A statement Sunday by the official Hungarian news agency MTIsaid: ``Hungary has decided to make it possible for the East Germancitizens staying in Hungary and refusing to return home to leave toany country which is prepared to let them through or receive them.''   ``Interior Minister Istvan Horvath instructed the police andborder guards to let East German citizens leave Hungary with theirEast German travel documents'' at any border point.   The Hungarian foreign minister, Gyula Horn, suggested onHungarian TV that tens of thousands of other East Germans nowvacationing in Hungary might join the exodus.   To make the exodus possible, he said, Hungary decided to suspenda 1969 agreement with East Germany, a Warsaw Pact ally, sayingHungary should not take into account West Germany's claim to EastGermans.   The fate of the refugees had been discussed for weeks by East andWest Germany, with Hungary insisting it was primarily a bystanderinterested in seeing a solution. The communique said, ``The talksbetween East Germany and West Germany ended in failure.'' It did notelaborate.   ``There are about 60,000 East Germans now in Hungary,'' Horn saidin the television interview, referring to thousands who have notregistered with the West German Embassy in Budapest to leave and areformally in Hungary as vacationers.   ``I cannot tell you how long it will last, but it surely won't be(just) for an hour,'' Horn said when asked how long the refugeeswould be allowed to leave simply by showing their East Germanpassports to Hungarian border guards.   Austrian television said a special Hungarian train carrying onlyEast German refugees had left from a camp in southwestern Hungaryfor the border late Sunday and four more trains would follow.   In Frankfurt, West Germany, Federal Railways spokesman KlausVollmer said that his Austrian counterparts moved 50 railway cars,with room for 90 people in each, to border points with Hungary.   Also, 40 West German railroad cars were moved to Passau andFreilassing, two Bavarian cities near the Austrian border, and 70Austrian buses were standing by, Vollmer said.   ``This is a humanitarian decision and an act of Europeansolidarity. I am deeply thankful to the Hungarian government,''Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany said in Bonn.   The refugee problem was a difficult one for Hungary, which wantedto show it is committed to Western concepts of human rights butreluctant to anger hard-line Communist leaders in East Berlin.   Hungary recently began implementing democratic reforms similar tothose being adopted by Poland and the Soviet Union, but East Germanyhas not.   Hungary's reform course has also caused tensions withCzechoslovakia and Romania, two other hard-line Soviet bloccountries.   About 6,000 East Germans had already fled their communisthomeland this summer by crossing from Hungary, where they werevacationing, to Austria. Budapest began dismantling borderfortifications in May in keeping with its new commitment to humanrights and more democracy.</TEXT></DOC>
