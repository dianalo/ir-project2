But in manyways he's a mystery to us,&quot; said Stephen Bokat, generalcounsel of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, noting that Mr.Thomas has faced few business issues in his career.</LP><TEXT>   Civil rights groups, in contrast, have a lengthy papertrail to examine. But they still face a difficult decision ofhow -- or whether -- to oppose the nominee. Mr. Thomas, ajudge on the federal appeals court here and before thatchairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commissionduring the Reagan administration, has attacked the veryunderpinnings of contemporary anti-discrimination policy. Hehas even criticized some aspects of the 1954 Brown vs. Boardof Education decision, in which the Supreme Court ordered anend to school segregation.   For most nominees, questioning the Brown decision wouldimmediately ignite a firestorm of opposition from a broadcoalition of civil rights groups. But because Mr. Thomas isblack, grew up in poverty and segregation, and may be morepalatable to liberals than other potential nominees, thatopposition hasn't materialized. And without unifiedopposition, Judge Thomas almost certainly will be confirmedhandily by the Senate, as he was only 15 months ago for theappeals court seat, civil rights lawyers said.   Civil rights groups remained muted in their reaction. &quot;Wearen't predisposed one way or the other,&quot; said Kerry Scanlon,assistant counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and EducationalFund. The advocacy group, which is reviewing Mr. Thomas'srecord before taking a position, will judge him &quot;just as wewould if he were white,&quot; Mr. Scanlon added. Other activistssaid there definitely would be vocal opposition to JudgeThomas from within the civil rights-civil libertiescoalition, but they weren't sure how widespread it would be.   Mr. Thomas's views on race provide ample basis forcontroversy. In various writings, he has attacked thelandmark Brown case for having been based on &quot;psychologicalevidence&quot; and &quot;compassion,&quot; rather than &quot;an adequateprinciple&quot; of law. Mr. Thomas has charged that legallyimposed integration has denigrated traditionally blackschools and led to forced busing and &quot;other policies thatwere irrelevant to parents' concern for a decent education.&quot;The Brown ruling resulted from a case argued by ThurgoodMarshall, the retiring Supreme Court justice and civil rightshero whose seat Judge Thomas would take.   Although business issues probably won't surface muchduring the confirmation process, corporate lawyers andlobbyists are trying to discern Mr. Thomas's views based on arelatively thin record. Business representatives praised hiseight-year tenure at the EEOC for the same reasons liberalscondemn it: Mr. Thomas shifted the commission's approach fromswiftly settling huge batches of cases to focusing instead oninvestigating instances where individual bias could beproved.   &quot;To the extent that he developed some sensitivity to thekinds of problems business faces in terms of jobdiscrimination claims and minority claims, that's positive,&quot;said Carter Phillips, a Washington lawyer who frequentlyrepresents companies before the Supreme Court. &quot;But beyondthe EEOC, you really don't know much at this point.&quot; On theappeals court, Mr. Thomas hasn't had to grapple withimportant corporate issues, such as the extent to whichstates may regulate businesses that are also regulated by thefederal government.   From Mr. Thomas's few business opinions, however, it ispossible to infer some elements of his thinking. He hasgenerally deferred to the regulatory judgments of federalagencies but scrupulously has avoided ruling on disputes thathe believed ought to be settled by the executive branch, notthe judiciary.   He has shown a distinct eagerness to wrestle with dry,technical issues. In a long, concurring opinion in a caseinvolving regulation of ferry-boat services, he criticizedthe majority opinion for failing to address whether onecompany had standing to bring certain claims. Citing casesfrom the 19th century, he argued against standing -- aposition commonly taken by companies defending all sorts oflawsuits against individual plaintiffs.   On a personal level, Mr. Thomas has demonstrated a stronginterest in corporate matters. As a legislative aide to Sen.John Danforth (R., Mo.), he avoided civil rights issues andworked on energy and environmental matters. In addition, Mr.Thomas's wife, Virginia, a Labor Department official, wasformerly a lobbyist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.</TEXT></DOC>
