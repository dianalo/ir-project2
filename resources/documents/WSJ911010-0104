That was April 19 last year. Given the bitterness thatprevails today, it is worth noting that Mom's Best Cookieswas once just one big happy family.</LP><TEXT>   For starters, there was Mom herself: Becky McCammon, apretty, young mother of three who founded the business in1981, selling cookies she baked at home in her kitchen. Herdaughter Amanda, six years old, came up with the name &quot;Mom'sBest.&quot; Dad, Don McCammon, ran the business. Mom's mostpopular cookie -- the fudge supreme, a thick square of fudgesandwiched with layers of oatmeal -- made use of Mrs.McCammon's own mother's favorite recipe.   Neighbors and church friends invested in the enterprise.It could not have been more homespun.   As sales zoomed, to $1.9 million by 1987, from $9,000 thefirst year, Mrs. McCammon became a local business celebrityand appeared on evangelist Pat Robertson's &quot;700 Club&quot; TVshow. Her cookies were sold in 26 states. &quot;There's a lot oflove in Mom's Best Cookies,&quot; said the brief corporate historystuffed into every box.   Today, love is what's missing.   The McCammons' marriage is history. They were divorced in1988, and Mr. McCammon left the company.   Mom's Best now is run by J. Wayne Jones, a marketingexecutive to whom Mrs. McCammon ceded control in a moment offinancial need. He put up $250,000, and she stayed on asexecutive vice president, with a five-year employmentcontract.   Now, there's no love lost between Mom and Mom's Best. Sheand the company are at war in court.   Last July, Mom's Best filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcycourt protection, which lets a company continue operatingwhile it works out a plan to pay creditors. Mr. Jones insiststhat the day-to-day business is doing fine. The problem, hesays, is Mom -- more specifically, the $347,000 courtjudgment she won against Mom's Best in June for firing her in1990.   The company is appealing the verdict. Meanwhile, it saysit doesn't have the money to pay the judgment.   The war in the cookie factory seems to follow one of theclassic recipes for a business blowup: mix the founders of acompany with a new regime that has ideas of its own -- andlet human nature take its course. The fact that all thecombatants seem to be nice people -- when they aren't dealingwith one another -- adds spice to the recipe.   In its early years, Mom's Best faced a problem common tobusiness start-ups: Although the cookies were great and saleswere good, financial results weren't. By 1988, the companywas facing its eighth consecutive year of losses. A majordebenture was coming due, and Mom's Best needed $200,000 topay it off. And with the McCammon's marriage on the rocks,Becky was looking for marketing talent to turn things around.   One evening, the McCammons were invited over for drinks bysome new neighbors, Wayne and Patricia Jones. It turned outthat Mr. Jones was a marketing executive with considerableexperience -- 25 years with Coca-Cola Co., four years withStroh Brewery Co. The couple had recently moved back toOrlando, Mrs. Jones's hometown, and they were looking to buya small business of their own.   In August, Mr. Jones agreed to invest $250,000 in Mom'sBest -- $210,000 as debt, $40,000 as equity -- in exchangefor a controlling interest. He became president and chiefexecutive officer, and got to name three of the fivedirectors. Mrs. McCammon was elected to one of the remainingboard seats. According to her employment contract, after oneyear she was to be paid a minimum annual salary of $85,000 --more money than she had ever earned before.   Mr. Jones put Mrs. McCammon's picture on the cookie label.He introduced new products (oat-bran muffins and such) andnew distribution and marketing plans. He began automating thecookie factory.   But as he moved to reduce overhead -- cutting expenses by$20,000 a month -- Mr. Jones stepped on some toes. He trimmedstaff and eliminated many of the little touches that had madeMom's Best a homey place to work. Mrs. McCammon and otherssay he cut out employee T-shirts, turkeys at Christmas andThanksgiving. And he quit letting workers take home a freebox of cookies each week. Mr. Jones says he &quot;had no idea&quot; thecompany ever gave away cookies, let alone turkeys andT-shirts. &quot;It's all news to me.&quot;   Within a year, Mr. Jones and Mrs. McCammon were barelyspeaking.   When Mr. Jones sought board approval for a stock-sale planin September 1989, Mrs. McCammon was the only director tooppose him -- arguing that it would benefit him at theexpense of other stockholders.   Mr. Jones began complaining to other directors that Mrs.McCammon wasn't earning her salary -- which, thanks to hervaunted employment contract, was more than anybody else waspaid. When the receptionist quit, he asked Mrs. McCammon tofill in for her, which she did for several months though itwas quite a comedown for Mom.   Later, he sent her a work schedule (&quot;in an attempt to helpraise the level of your productivity&quot;), calling for her totravel with delivery people to promote products -- startingat 6 in the morning. She sent it to her lawyer but otherwiseignored it.   He took her name -- and her daughter's and her mother's --off the corporate history packed with each box of cookies;his was the only name that remained.   Despite the bad vibrations, Mrs. McCammon didn't feel herjob was in jeopardy. &quot;I thought because of my employmentcontract I was safe,&quot; she says. Thus, when the April boardmeeting rolled around last year, she wasn't expecting theworst.   Shortly after the meeting started, Mr. Jones abruptlyaccused Mrs. McCammon of trying to hire away employees, starta competing business and steal customers -- all in violationof her contract. When she denied the charges, he producedaffidavits he had gathered from two employees, saying theyhad discussed such matters with Mom.   &quot;I was flabbergasted,&quot; says Mrs. McCammon.   Despite her denials, the vote to fire her was four to one.She cast the only vote in her favor.   A few months later, on Aug. 2, Mrs. McCammon filed suit inOrange County Circuit Court, alleging that her dismissalviolated her employment contract. The trial, last May, lastedfour days. The jury took less than two hours to find for Momif not motherhood. The company filed for bankruptcy courtprotection in July.   Mr. Jones says Mom's Best sells about 4 million cookies ayear and has a positive cash flow, with sales of about$150,000 a month. He predicts a quick trip through bankruptcycourt. &quot;We are hoping we will be out of this thing by earlynext year and going forward again,&quot; he says.   As to the reorganization proceedings, he says: &quot;We will doour best to get everybody paid. We are not running from ourresponsibilities, we are covering them.&quot;   That may not apply to Mrs. McCammon's court judgment,however. Both she and the company say the Chapter 11 filingwill make it harder for her to collect.   Meanwhile, she is supporting herself with a newenterprise, called Becky's Best Inc. She bakes cakes forlocal restaurants. But Mom's Best is still after her,claiming that this is yet another violation of her jobcontract -- a breach of the noncompete clause. The judge inthe earlier civil case is mulling it over.</TEXT></DOC>
