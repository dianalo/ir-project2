In its preseason notice of 1988management measures (53 FR 16002, May 4, 1988), NOAA announced that theoverall recreational impact (hooking mortality and landings) quota wouldbe 298,400 coho salmon from Cape Falcon, Oregon, to the U.S.-Mexico border.The commercial fishery from Cape Falcon to the U.S.-Mexico border wouldbe managed not to exceed an impact (hooking mortality and landings) quotaof 684,700 coho salmon. On or about August 1, the Pacific Fishery ManagementCouncil's Salmon Technical Team (Team) would estimate the number of cohosalmon needed to complete the recreational seasons south of Cape Falcon,and that any portion of the recreational quota not needed to complete scheduledrecreational seasons would be reallocated to the commercial fishery (53FR 16010 May 4, 1988).Members of the Team conferred on August 12 and, based on the best availableinformation, projected that the recreational fisheries south of Cape Falconwould harvest only 253,400 coho salmon during the course of the season,leaving 45,000 coho salmon available for transfer to the commercial fishery.Therefore, NOAA issues this notice: (1) To reduce the recreational quotafor the area south of Cape Falcon from 298,400 to 253,400 coho salmon,and (2) to increase the commercial quota for the area south of Cape Falconfrom 684,700 to 729,700 coho salmon, effective at midnight, August 15,1988. This notice does not apply to other fisheries which may be operatingin other areas.The Regional Director consulted with representatives of the Pacific FisheryManagement Council, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, and theCalifornia Department of Fish and Game before making these adjustmentsto commercial and recreational quotas for coho salmon south of Cape Falcon.The State of Oregon will manage the commercial fishery in state watersadjacent to this area of the EEZ in accordance with this federal action.Any delay in taking this action could likely result in the premature attainmentof the commercial coho quota and the unjustified disruption of the commercialsalmon fishing season in the area. Because of the need for immediate action,the Secretary of Commerce has determined that good cause exists for thisnotice to be issued without affording a prior opportunity for public comment.Therefore, public comments on this notice will be accepted for 15 daysafter the effective date, through August 30, 1988.Federal regulations at 50 CFR 661.21(b)(1)(i) authorize the modificationof quotas if certain findings are made as described in the appendix to50 CFR Part 661, Section III.B. Accordingly, the Regional Director hasdetermined this inseason adjustment is consistent with fishery regimesestablished by the U.S.-Canada Pacific Salmon Commission, ocean escapementgoals, conservation of the salmon resource, any adjudicated fishing rights,and the ocean allocation scheme in the FMP. This inseason adjustment isbased on consideration of the total allowable impact limitation for cohosalmon south of Cape Falcon, Oregon, the amount of recreational catch ofcoho salmon and recreational effort in the area to date, the estimatedaverage daily catch per recreational fisherman, and the predicted recreationalfishing effort for the area to the end of the scheduled season.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Matters</ITAG>This action is authorized by 50 CFR 661.21(b)(1)(i) and is in compliancewith Executive Order 12291.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 661</ITAG>Fisheries, Fishing, Indians.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>(16 U.S.C. 1801 <T3>et seq.</T3>)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: August 15, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Richard H.
