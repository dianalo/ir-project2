Trade Secretary Nicholas Ridley said he would not refer Hoylake'soffer to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, upholding theConservative government's free-market policies and sweeping asideconcerns about the advent of giant, highly leveraged, junkbond-financed buyouts in Britain.   However, Ridley said, the matter could be reconsidered if therewere a material change in the terms of the bid for BAT or other``material facts.''   The decision followed last week's ruling by the Panel onTakeovers and Mergers giving Hoylake _ which is led by financier SirJames Goldsmith _ more time for its bid. The offer has been delayedby regulatory hurdles in the United States.   BAT stock rose 22 cents to close at $13.07 a share Thursday onLondon's Stock Exchange.   Hoylake is offering $13.87 in securities for each BAT share.   BAT noted Ridley's decision ``with regret,'' but said it waspleased the trade secretary left open the possibility of referringthe bid to the mergers commission if its terms were changed.   BAT said a referral to the monopolies commission would have giventhe British government a chance to establish a policy on takeoversthat rely heavily on risky junk bonds.   Junk bonds have a ``negative potential for the markets, forcompanies and for small shareholders,'' BAT said.   Securities analysts have said Hoylake would have to raise itsoffer and include cash to succeed.   Hoylake wants to retain BAT's tobacco interests and sell itsretailing, financial services and paper and packaging operations.   BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy said his company would try to defeatthe Hoylake bid on its merits. He said BAT was determined to ``takesuitable measures to provide a sustainable long-term increase'' inshareholder value.   Because Hoylake was formed by Goldsmith, British merchant bankerJacob Rothschild and Australian entrepreneur Kerry Packerspecifically to make the BAT bid, it was unlikely the offer would bereferred to the monopolies commission on competition grounds, acommon basis for review.   The bid's opponents have argued for an investigation into whetherthe offer is in the public interest, contending that suchhighly-leveraged takeovers could strap British companies with debt,cut down on their investments and distract executives fromday-to-day management.   Ridley said he based his decision on a recommendation by DirectorGeneral of Trading Sir Gordon Borrie, who advised there were nocompetitive problems raised by the buyout offer.   ``In the first instance it must be for the shareholders todecide,'' Ridley said in an interview on British Broadcasting Corp.radio. ``I would not wish to interfere in a purely marketsituation.''   Bryan Gould, an opposition Labor lawmaker who serves as hisparty's spokesman on trade matters, said, ``This is a triumph ofnarrow ideology over the wider interests of British industry.''   Hoylake requested that the takeover panel grant it a lengthierbid timetable because of the need to secure approval from U.S. stateinsurance commissioners for a change in ownership of BAT's FarmersInsurance Group Inc., which is based in Los Angeles.   Insurance regulators in nine states have undertaken reviews ofthe deal.   Hoylake wants to sell Farmers to the French insurance company AxaMidi Assurances. Goldsmith's group is hoping the move will speed upU.S. approval for their bid.   BAT immediately appealed the takeover panel's decision allowingHoylake to renew its offer for BAT within 21 days of overcoming itsregulatory obstacles in the United States.   Normally in Britain, a bidder is given 90 days to win a majoritystake in its target. If the bidder fails, it must wait at least ayear before bidding again.</TEXT></DOC>
