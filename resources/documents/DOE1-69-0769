In a simpler process,based on the University of California, Berkeley, Sulfur Recovery Process(UCBSRP) technology, hydrogen sulfide, propane and heavier hydrocarbonsand water are absorbed simultaneously by a pol(glycol ether) solventcontaining a homogenous liquid-phase catalyst. The catalyst promotesthe subsequent reaction of hydrogen sulfide with added sulfur dioxideto produce a high-quality sulfur product. Hydrocarbons are separatedas two product streams with the split between propane and butane. Thisnew process offers an overall reduction in both capital and energy costs.</TEXT></DOC>
