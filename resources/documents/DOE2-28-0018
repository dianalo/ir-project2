<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-28-0018 </DOCNO><TEXT>Symmetrical nuclear matter is studied in the vicinity of the saturationpoint in the framework of an approximation scheme which includes single-particlecorrelations. The Hugenholtz-Van Hove theorem is well satisfied, in contrastwith standard Brueckner calculations. The incompressibility and the saturationpoints are only slightly affected by correlations, while the effectivemass shows an enhancement at the Fermi momentum.</TEXT></DOC>
