(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The National Council of Churches hasdemanded that the United States pull its troops out of the PersianGulf and work for a peaceful settlement of the Iraq-Kuwait crisis.   The only troops that should stay in the region are those whosepresence is requested by the United Nations, the council said in aresolution adopted unanimously Thursday at the group's convention.   ``We stand at a unique moment in human history, when all aroundus seemingly impregnable walls are being broken down and deephistorical enmities are being healed,'' the council said. ``Andyet, ironically, at such a moment our own nation seems to be poisedat the brink of war in the Middle East.''   The council also called on Iraq to release all foreign citizensheld hostage in Iraq and Kuwait and to withdraw its troops fromKuwait.   It said President Bush and the Congress should use every meansto reach a peaceful settlement, including direct negotiations withIraq.   The council represents about 42 million Americans from 32denominations, including many of the nation's largest mainstreamChristian churches.   Also Thursday, the group decried family violence as sin andcalled on Christian communities to actively protect women andchildren from victimization. At the same time, the councilconfessed that past ``inaction by church leadership has sustainedthe injustice of family violence.''   Family violence is an epidemic in Western, post-industrialsocieties, where it is considered a birthright by some men, thestatement said. In some cases, it said, ``even interpretations ofscripture'' support the notion of males' right to control andchastise others.</TEXT></DOC>
