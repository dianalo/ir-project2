The strataweightings inflicted considerable damage to face equipment. These weremonitored utilising a) underground data logging techniques to measurepowered support leg pressures and closures, and b) water level measurementsin surface boreholes. The measurements showed that the weightings developedover a number of hours prior to their visual detection underground andthat they displayed a recognisable fingerprint. It was concluded thatwarning of weightings on geologically vulnerable faces might be providedif powered support leg closure rates were continually monitored. Thegeological environment causing these phenomena and the MINLOG instrumentationscheme which was developed to provide a warning in the surface controlroom of impending weightings are described. Results from both undergroundmonitoring on the earlier faces and monitoring of longwalls utilisingthe MINLOG system are presented and discussed. The implications for facedesign at other collieries within the Selby complex are also considered.4 refs., 13 figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
