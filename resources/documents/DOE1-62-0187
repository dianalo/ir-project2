Pollutants examinedinclude: acidic depositions, heavy metal particulates, sulphur dioxide,ozone, nitrogen oxides, acid fogs, and mixtures of these. Various typesof ecosystem stresses and physiological mechanisms pertinent to aciddeposition are also discussed. Related subjects, such as the effectsof ethylene on vegetation, the physiology of drought in trees, the abilityof soils to generate acidity naturally, the role of Sphagnum moss innatural peatland acidity, the use of lichens as indicators of changingair quality, and the magnitude of natural emissions of reduced sulphurgases from tropical rainforests and temperate deciduous forests, arecovered.</TEXT></DOC>
