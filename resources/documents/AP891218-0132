U.S. cigarette consumption may be off about 4 percent from lastyear, the report said, without detail. ``Use of cigars and smokingtobacco continues to decline, but snuff production is up,'' itadded.   The Agriculture Department said the U.S. tobacco crop is largerthis year than last, but overall 1989-90 supplies are lower becauseof smaller stocks held at the beginning of the year.   ``Tighter supplies, higher price supports, and a little betterquality 1989 crop have boosted prices of most types of tobacco thisseason,'' said the report.   Flue-cured tobacco averaged $1.67 a pound, 6 cents more thanlast year.   Burley sales began Nov. 20, with prices averaging about 5 centsa pound higher than a year earlier.   Total production this year is expected to be nearly 1.5 billionpounds, 7 percent above 1988, but 16 percent below the 1980-85average.</TEXT></DOC>
