At a briefing, EPA chief William Reilly also announcedthat the agency is issuing a new guidebook on asbestos thatemphasizes that removal isn't necessarily the best way toreduce potential exposure to the substance. In addition, hesaid he is pleased with the progress made recently by Houseand Senate conferees that are reconciling their differingclean-air bills.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Reilly said the emissions cuts, which will becompleted in December 1993, would reduce overall toxic airemissions from these facilities by almost 83%, or 9,460,000pounds, annually. &quot;This is an extraordinary voluntary effort,demonstrating that EPA and industry can work cooperatively toaddress environmental problems,&quot; Mr. Reilly said.   The nine companies are BASF Corp.; Dow Chemical Co.; ExxonCorp.; General Electric Co.; Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber Co.;Occidental Petroleum Corp.; Reichhold Chemicals Inc., asubsidiary of DIC Americas Inc.; Texaco Inc. and TexasPetrochemicals Corp. Some of the plants could get credit forreductions that would be required under proposals pending inthe clean-air conference.   The largest cut from a single plant would come from a GEplant in Mt. Vernon, Ind., which is scheduled to cutemissions of methylene chloride, which the EPA lists as aprobable human carcinogen, by 6,113,390 pounds a year. ATexaco facility in Port Neches, Texas, is scheduled to reduceemissions of butadiene, a probable human carcinogen, by1,199,230 pounds a year.   The agreement grew out of an August 1989 meeting when Mr.Reilly sought commitments from senior officers of these ninecompanies and the Chemical Manufacturers Association. The 40plants are on a list of 182 facilities the agency hasidentified as having high estimated risks from toxic airemissions. As part of the agreement, the companies willsubmit annual reports describing their progress.   On asbestos, the EPA said the substance is a health hazardonly when its fibers are breathed into the lungs. But ifasbestos isn't airborne and isn't releasing fibers, it shouldbe maintained until buildings are renovated or demolished,the agency said.   The EPA insists that its new guidebook represents arenewed emphasis rather than a change in policy. Many schoolofficials and building owners, however, have believed thatthe EPA has been encouraging costly asbestos removal.   A Goodyear spokesman said the company has already achieveda 61% reduction in emissions of butadiene at four of itsplants since December 1988 and expects further reductions byJanuary 1991.   &quot;We agree emission reductions must be a top priority andin 1987 we committed to reduce emissions by 75% over afive-year period,&quot; said Joe Murphy, human resources managerat the GE plastics' site in Mount Vernon, Ind. Mr. Murphyadded that GE is planning a &quot;long-term process change&quot; thatwill eliminate more than 80% of the methylene chlorideemissions at the site by 1993.</TEXT></DOC>
