Ms. Asprodites has struggled for days to get her studentsat Clear Spring Elementary School here to fathom the namesand uses of simple machines. Reading &quot;The Sneetches&quot; aloud,the young teacher dwells for a time on a contraption owned byone Sylvester McMonkey McBean, closes the book and speaks.   &quot;With a partner, you're going to think about puttingtogether simple machines to make a compound machine, and drawit. . . . The machine should change people, like Mr. McBeandid.&quot;   Pairing off, the students sketch screws, wedges and ramps.Levers work gears. Wheels meet axles. Ms. Asprodites wants toknow the definition of a compound machine. &quot;Two or moresimple machines put together,&quot; say several voices. Mr. McBeanhas done the job.   Team learning and the use of literature outside of readingclass are new teaching techniques. But potentially moresignificant is the background of the new teacher. Ahigh-school valedictorian and Phi Beta Kappa graduate ofnearby Trinity University last June, Ms. Asprodites spentfive years instead of the usual four preparing to be ateacher, focused on English and history instead of educationcourses, and learned much of her technique from veteranteachers, not education professors.   Ms. Asprodites and Trinity are part of a little-notedbright spot in education: the rising quality of new teachers.Trinity and a handful of San Antonio schools havedemonstrated how a concerted effort to improve teachers, newand experienced, can yield benefits in the classroom.   Scholastic Aptitude Test scores of college freshmen whointend to teach plunged throughout the 1970s, bottoming in1980 at 807 (of a possible 1,600), 83 points below average.While overlooked by the many negative school studies sincethen, the gap has steadily closed. This year's freshmen whoplan to teach scored 847 on the SAT, 49 points below par.Average scores on the National Teacher Examination, used forcertification in 30 states, have risen seven points on a270-point scale since 1982. Six states have raised minimumpassing scores on the NTE in that time.   Educators attribute the rising quality of young teachersto higher pay and concern for schools. Lifted mainly by addedstate spending, last year's average teacher salary of $32,880was 27% higher than a decade ago, after inflation. One in 12college freshmen now wants to be a teacher, the highestinterest level in 15 years.   &quot;All the reports and talk about schools has raisedconsciousness about teaching, and college students haveresponded,&quot; says Phillip C. Schlechty, president of theCenter for Leadership in School Reform, a nonprofitconsulting group in Louisville, Ky. &quot;There's more celebrationof great teaching in local communities, more recognition andawards. Teaching has become something to get into.&quot;   The progress so far is no cause for euphoria. On average,the teaching profession still draws from a sub-par talentpool. In some schools, teacher qualifications are desperatelyshort. Only 54% of high-school science teachers have ascience degree; in mathematics the figure is 42%. (In Germanhigh schools, teachers must have degrees in math and scienceto teach those subjects.)   Even worse, some educators say, most school reformers actas if there is no link between good teachers and how muchstudents learn. States in the last decade mandated toughercurriculum and tests. Advocates for the poor fought in courtfor equitable funding. The Reagan administration pushed widerschool choice for parents. With his six education goals forthe year 2000, President Bush's vision has been broader. Buthis goals don't include improving teachers.   &quot;We've fiddled with the curriculum, we've fiddled withtesting, and we've fiddled with finance, but we haven't doneanything to get better teachers in American classrooms,&quot; saysJohn Moore, chairman of Trinity's education department.   Empirical evidence of a bygone Golden Age in U.S. teachingis hard to come by. But many educators believe that theopening of career opportunities for women and minorities overthe last 25 years diverted many talented people fromeducation to other fields. Some say teaching quality peakedin the 1950s and '60s when many well-educated Europeanrefugees from World War II taught, Sputnik spurred U.S.subsidies for teacher training in math and science, and youngmen rushed into teaching to avoid the Vietnam draft.   Dr. Moore, working with some San Antonio schools, ishelping to restore teacher quality. In 1986, he startedwooing top-notch academic talent with merit scholarships. Hejunked the four-year education major at Trinity, and replacedit with five years of training that includes more arts andsciences, fewer courses in teaching methods, and a full-yearteaching internship. The program also includes a group ofveteran teachers at four San Antonio schools. They agree totrain Trinity student teachers in exchange for the freedom todesign and implement new classroom methods.   Academic scholars have acknowledged deficiencies inteacher training for some time. Although Trinity's strategyshares many ideas offered in a 1986 report by a group of topeducation deans, &quot;Tomorrow's Teachers,&quot; education scholarshave mainly resisted the reforms. Few colleges haveeliminated education majors. Only about a quarter havelengthened training programs. The typical teacher stillspends only about 12 weeks as a student teacher beforebecoming certified.   Though it is expensive, and has attracted critics who sayit is elitist, the Trinity program has helped raise testscores and cut dropout rates among students exposed to thenew approaches. It has also created a network of teachers inthe San Antonio area with a strong esprit de corps and senseof what needs to be changed in schooling. In a society thatjokes nonchalantly about what those who can't do, Trinity hasgiven its graduates and mentors something that teachers cravemore than money, and lack more acutely than good SAT scores:respect.   &quot;There's been lots of reports telling me what's wrong witheducation,&quot; says Tricia Shaughnessy, a Trinity mentor atNathaniel Hawthorne Elementary School in San Antonio. &quot;Butfor the first time, someone has had enough faith in me, as aprofessional, to prescribe a cure.&quot;   After 24 years of teaching social studies and &quot;feeling alittle bit burned out,&quot; Patsy Thompson says she found it&quot;amazing&quot; that Trinity sought her views on what works in theclassroom. In 1986, Trinity chose her to help design its neweducation curriculum and oversee Trinity interns at SanAntonio's Robert E. Lee High School. Trinity also exposed herto research on new teaching techniques. Now, her geographylessons include role playing, team learning, and gettingstudents involved in real civic debates, including writingletters in a recent battle over development of Texas' barrierislands. &quot;Trinity gave me a feeling that even if I'm notgoing to be teaching much longer, I will leave something ofmyself behind,&quot; she says.   Some recent Trinity graduates remember how their firstspark of aspiration to teach was nearly snuffed out. &quot;In highschool, my teachers told me, `You have brains, do somethingelse,'&quot; says Ms. Asprodites, who nearly took the advice. Sheflirted with a communications or business career until asorority sister at Trinity introduced her to Dr. Moore. Hepersuaded her to attend a Saturday-morning teachingcolloquium, and soon her concerns about low pay and statusfaded.   At $22,150 a year as a starting teacher, her pay isn'thigh. But with three years' experience as a student teacherand a stellar academic record, Ms. Asprodites had thecredentials to get a job offer from Clear Spring, where theprincipal promised her instructional freedom --&quot;empowerment,&quot; as she puts it, to try out her brand of theliterature-intensive &quot;whole language&quot; approach to schooling.   Forty percent of new teachers leave the classroom withinfive years. &quot;The reason I won't be part of those statistics,&quot;says Ms. Asprodites, &quot;is because I don't have to follow theusual chapter-and-verse methods.&quot;   Trinity calls its links to Nathaniel Hawthorne, Lee andtwo other schools in San Antonio the Alliance for BetterSchools. The schools act as practice clinics for Trinity'sstudents in return for free labor and the university'seducational advice. Trinity students observe and help out inthe schools in each of their first four years, followed bythe full fifth year internship. At Trinity's urging, theschools treat mentors more like professionals thanclockpunchers. Teachers who mentor Trinity novices get perksthey value, including instructional independence and an extraplanning period each day.   The Trinity program has aspects that are so costly theymay be impossible to replicate elsewhere. Stephen Johnson,the principal of Mark Twain Middle School, estimates that hisAlliance program for likely dropout prospects, called theFrog Pond, costs twice as much to run as a typical classbecause of lower student-teacher ratios. But of the 40students who entered the program in 1988, only six have leftschool so far, versus a 50% dropout rate for students withthe same previous record of school trouble.   Some critics regard Trinity's recruiting strategies aselitist and ineffective. James Sears, a University of SouthCarolina professor, studied the first crop of Trinitystudents that were lured with merit scholarships andconcluded they were no better prepared than other educationstudents. He also says the $26,000 in scholarships would bebetter spent on recruiting students based on economic need,not merit, since research shows that teachers from low-incomebackgrounds stay in the profession longer.   Recipients of the Trinity scholarships had to teach fortwo years, or repay the money. Prof. Sears says he doubtsthat most Trinity students recruited by merit will staybeyond their commitment. But Dr. Moore says 15 of the 17original students are still teaching, many in poor areas ofSan Antonio -- two years after completing their scholarshipobligations.   The Alliance has also divided some of the host schools byriling teachers who don't get the same perks and specialtreatment that mentors do. But Trinity's fans are many. Gainsfor San Antonio students have come relatively quickly.   &quot;Trinity has been at the forefront,&quot; says Art Wise,president of the National Council for the Accreditation ofTeacher Education, which licenses teacher colleges. AddsErnest Boyer, president of the Carnegie Foundation for theAdvancement of Teaching, &quot;In terms of recruiting, trainingand renewing teachers, it's one of the most impressiveefforts in the nation.&quot;   Trinity's first wave of merit-recruited teachers hit theschools in 1988. The first teachers trained for five years,including 23-year-old Ms. Asprodites, started this fall.Principals and parents give them high marks for innovationand in helping turn troubled students around.   The schools have also demonstrated gains. Troubledfreshmen in an anti-dropout program at Lee High School raisedtheir grades above school averages and dropped out at an 11%rate, less than half of comparable students elsewhere in thedistrict.   At Hawthorne, an inner city San Antonio school plagued bya high student transfer rate and low achievement, teachers inthe Trinity program devised something called the&quot;collaborative.&quot; In elementary schools with more than oneclass at each grade level, groupings typically change everyyear in random fashion. A new grade means new classmates, anew teacher and a new teaching style. But in thecollaborative, students, randomly selected for the program,progress upward in grades as a single group. Parents signpledges not to move their children to other schools.Moreover, teachers in the collaborative use common teachingmethods based on their analysis of the latest educationresearch and consultations with Trinity.   Mobility, a measure of transfer rates, has slowed. Onlytwo of the 80 students in the collaborative have left,compared to a 59% annual mobility rate for the schooloverall. Collaborative second graders last spring scored atthe third-grade level on the Metropolitan Achievement Test,seven months higher than the school average. In language use,their scores were at the level of a fifth-month third grader,eight months ahead of the average for all second graders inthe school. Math scores were the same as the rest of theschool.   Collaborative teachers have latched onto something theyand others in education call the whole-language approach. Anoutgrowth of an anti-traditional movement in readinginstruction, it posits that students will learn more if theyget more good story books and writing assignments, and fewerstilted textbooks and worksheets. Teachers also steepstudents in cooperative learning, based on researchers'findings that two heads or more are better than one.   Just after lunch, second graders in the Hawthornecollaborative sit bunched on a rug in a corner. Together,they write lines for a play about Christopher Columbus. Theyalso fidget, talk out of turn, and rush around looking upfacts in books scattered around the room. But the script,already four jumbo-size pages long and taped to theblackboard, lengthens rapidly. And when Ms. Shaughnessy,wearing an outfit of bright blue and orange, speaks, shecommands attention.   &quot;Then what does he do? Raise your hand if you know,&quot; shecoaxes. &quot;Frankie?&quot;   &quot;He goes to the king and queen,&quot; says Francisco Salazar,relieved at having been called.   &quot;The king and queen of . . . ?&quot;   &quot;Spain.&quot;   &quot;What should they say?&quot;   &quot;We give you three ships,&quot; says Francisco, creatingdialogue with the authentic ring of his forebears. &quot;La Pinta,la Nina, y la Santa Maria.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
