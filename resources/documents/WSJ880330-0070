House Speaker James Wright (D., Texas) and House Republican Leader Bob Michel of Illinois met face-to-face last night to settle the final details of the $50-million measure, which the full House is expected to approve as early as today.    Leaders in both parties expected the package to win widespread support. &quot;I'm hopeful that we'll have a majority&quot; of Republicans supporting it, said Rep. Dick Cheney (R., Wyo.). Added Rep. David Bonior (D., Mich.): &quot;This will carry well on both sides of the aisle.&quot;    The measure would sustain the U.S.-supported Contra forces in cease-fire zones within Nicaragua, where they are to await the outcome of peace talks scheduled to begin next week.    One of the final obstacles to the agreement was removed when Mr. Wright agreed to sign a letter to President Reagan and Rep. Michel promising that he wouldn't block consideration of any requests from the president for further aid, including weapons and ammunition, should the Nicaraguan peace talks falter.    Republican lawmakers and the Reagan administration had insisted that the legislation guarantee Mr. Reagan a congressional vote on a military-aid request in order to keep pressure on Nicaragua's Sandinista government.    The bill would send the Contras about $20 million in food, shelter, clothing and medical supplies over a six-month period, in compliance with last week's cease-fire accord. That sum would also include communications equipment, which Contra leaders told lawmakers would be important for the force's maintenance during the cease-fire.    The assistance would flow at a rate comparable to that of earlier aid packages, which administration officials said would be the minimum it would accept.    In addition, the measure would provide $20 million to establish a fund for children who have been wounded in the seven-year Nicaraguan civil war. It would also give $10 million to the Organization of American States to monitor the cease-fire.    U.S. aid to the Contras ended Feb. 29, and lawmakers have twice rejected requests to renew it. The effort to renew aid to the Contras gained momentum last week when the rebels and the Sandinistas agreed to a cease-fire and talks aimed at national reconciliation. </TEXT></DOC>
