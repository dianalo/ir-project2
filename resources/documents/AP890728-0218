In contrast, there was a net exodusof 632,000 people in 1985-86 and 952,000 in 1986-87.   About a third of the '86-'87 loss was in the 18-24 age group.More than half the adults who left rural areas in that period hadat least a year of college; almost 27 percent had four years.   These figures are from the 1988 rural poverty report by thePopulation Reference Bureau. Rural refers to non-metro counties,those not surrounding large cities. About two-thirds of thenation's counties are non-metro, but they have only 23 percent ofthe population.   The report also noted the data was based on Census Bureausamplings, which were redesigned in 1984. As a result, there areinconsistencies between statistics gathered before and after 1984.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Aug. 6</NOTE></DOC>
