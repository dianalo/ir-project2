(Bus Stop) (a comparison of VMEbus and MultibusII developments) (Column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Lieberman, David.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>The VMEbus has gained a greater share of the bus market thanMultibus II, but both technologies are undergoing developmentsthat will further their performance and capabilities.andP;  Theasynchronous VMEbus is cited for its flexibility and its use of ashared-memory model.andP;  The synchronous Multibus II is cited for itspredictability, how the hardware-assisted message passingefficiently uses bandwidth and the standardization of relatedhigh-level software.andP;  The forthcoming 1992 revisions of MultibusII will include a doubling of clock rate to 20 MHz with consequentdata transfer rate doubling to 80Mbytes/second.andP;  Unfortunately, asystem containing old and new boards will perform at the lowestcommon rate.andP;  The upgraded VMEbus will employ a 64-bitarchitecture, multiplexed block transfer mode andsource-synchronized block transfer mode that adds synchronousoperation to the asynchronous bus.andP;  Upgrading to the new bus willnot be a simple operation.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     ComparisonVMEbusMultibusSystem DevelopmentOutlookFunctional CapabilitiesUpgrading.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
