But one Cabinet alumnus who has kept his halo is Drew Lewis, the Transportation secretary who broke the 1981 air controllers' strike.    Mr. Lewis went on to lead a turnaround at Warner Amex Cable Communications before joining Union Pacific in April 1986.    But lately Wall Street has shown some disenchantment with the company now led by Mr. Lewis, 56 years old, who became chairman and chief executive officer last October. Union Pacific's stock has fallen from a high of 67 in June to the mid-50s. It closed yesterday at 57 1/4, up 1/8.    &quot;This is now one of the poorer-performing transportation stocks,&quot; says Andras Petery, who follows those stocks for Morgan Stanley. &quot;It's been a very frustrating stock to recommend.&quot; The problem: disappointing second-quarter profit. While other railroads rose 15% to 20%, Union Pacific railroad earnings inched up 2.8%.    Goldman Sachs transportation analyst Michael Armellino, in a report last week, said declining oil prices have hurt Union Pacific's energy unit. He said investors were also probably miffed that an 18% rise in ton-miles didn't boost railroad earnings more. Union Pacific has been cutting prices on some routes.    Mr. Armellino said investors are &quot;misreading&quot; those earnings results, overlooking market-share gains that may help future profits, and called the reaction a &quot;buying opportunity.&quot; All the same, he cut his earnings estimates by 10 cents a share for both 1988 and 1989 to $5.35 and $5.65.    Other analysts aren't as confident. Graeme Lidgerwood of First Boston rates the stock a &quot;hold.&quot; She questions whether Union Pacific, which acts like a cyclical stock subject to the ups and downs of the economy, should merit a multiple so close to that of the market as a whole.    Union Pacific trades at 10.9 times her 1988 estimate of $5.25 a share, just a shade under the 11.5 multiple of the Standard andamp; Poor's 500 stock index. Other cyclical stocks sell for much lower multiples in the single digits.    Ms. Lidgerwood wonders how much earnings momentum the company can expect as its profit is &quot;driven by the railroad and trucking business. The third quarter is going to be flat. I'm trying to figure out what's going to get the earnings off dead center. How much ton-mile growth can the railroad really show if we have slower economic growth?&quot;    Several railroad stocks have enjoyed flurries of interest based on the values of their assets, including real estate. Union Pacific enjoyed a separate flurry earlier this year when it came out that Mr. Lewis and other top executives stand to reap huge bonuses from a $17.1 million pool if the stock price tops $100 a share for 60 consecutive calendar days.    Some observers grouse about Mr. Lewis's decision to relocate Union Pacific's corporate headquarters from Manhattan to Bethlehem, Pa. Aside from the expense, they note that it puts the company closer to Mr. Lewis's home in Blue Bell, Pa. The company says it moved because Bethlehem is close to New York, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., and because costs are lower there.    So far, however, Mr. Lewis hasn't pursued any sort of high-profile union-busting approach to cutting labor costs that would hark back to the controllers' strike.    Mr. Armellino cites a problem that may be more vital to Union Pacific's main business. He says management is sacrificing short-term profits to try to reverse market-share losses against truckers and make gains against other railroads.    To demonstrate its commitment to service, Mr. Armellino says the company has chosen the expensive strategy of running shorter trains. However, he says the main threat to this higher level of service is that other connecting railroads may not perform as well.    For the moment, the earnings outlook doesn't seem to be getting better. Goldman expects that Union Pacific's third-quarter earnings won't show any improvement from last year. An estimated 24% drop in energy earnings is expected to cancel out an 11% rise in rail profit.    ---   Union Pacific   (NYSE; Symbol: UNP)   Business: Railroad, oil and gas   Year ended Dec. 31, 1987:   Revenue: $5.94 billion   Net Income: $582.9 million; or $5.10 a share*   Second quarter, June 30, 1988:   Per-share earnings: $1.35 vs. $1.25   Average daily trading volume: 179,543 shares -   Common shares outstanding: 105.1 million   *Includes $23 million net gain related to restructuring</TEXT></DOC>
