SANDOK</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Twenty years after it was founded, theAmerican Indian Movement continues to struggle for American Indianrights, but its methods are quiet compared to the violence andconfrontation that marked its early days.   ``The American Indian Movement broke a hole through the wall andeveryone else came through,'' said Rosemary Ackley Christensen,director of Indian education for Minneapolis Public Schools.   ``People may not have always liked the form these strategiestook, but I appreciate what these men have done.''   Other Indian leaders are critical of AIM's legacy.   ``The violence of their tactics created a backlash againstpeople on the reservations,'' said Tim Giago, editor of the LakotaTimes, a weekly Indian newspaper in Martin, S.D.   ``AIM got a lot of national attention, but not all of it wasgood attention. It upset people in Congress, who voted againstbills that would have helped American Indians. We're stillrecovering from that,'' Giago said.   The group began a 20th-anniversary celebration Thursday at FortSnelling State Park featuring dancers and drum groups from aroundthe country and speeches by AIM leaders.   ``We have much to celebrate,'' said spokesman Vernon Bellecourt,whose brother Clyde was an AIM founder and is now its executivedirector. ``But we have to look at the fact that our lands andresources are still being exploited.''   One of the organization's first acts was organizing a patrol tomonitor allegations of police harassment and brutality againstIndians in Minneapolis.   But the concerns that brought about 150 Indians to a July 28,1968, meeting _ such as housing, education and jobs _ went beyondthe borders of Minnesota, and often were overshadowed by AIMtactics.   AIM gained notoriety with the 1972 seizure of the Bureau ofIndian Affairs building in Washington, D.C., and a 1973 riot at theCuster, S.D., courthouse.   The 71-day reservation occupation at Wounded Knee, S.D., lefttwo Indians dead and a federal marshall permanently paralyzed.   Felony charges against AIM activists Russell Means and DennisBanks, who led the uprising, were dismissed after an eight-weektrial.   A 1975 shootout at Pine Ridge reservation at Wounded Knee lefttwo FBI agents dead and got AIM activist Leonard Peltier two lifeprison terms.   Christensen, who has no formal ties to AIM, said the violenceduring the early years divided the Indian community, but she wouldnot judge AIM leaders.   ``God knows, the FBI and white people had a hell of a lot moreweapons and other things than Indians had,'' Christensen said. ``Irespect and admire people who are not going to give up against allodds.''   AIM activists in the early 1970s also opened schools andorganized legal rights and job training projects.   Don Allery, historian for the Red Lake Tribe, said he wasinvolved with AIM during its formative years but becamedisenchanted when it didn't follow through on complaints about suchthings as job discrimination.   ``The route they took, I guess it served a purpose,'' Allerysaid. But he said he thinks AIM failed ``on anything that requireda consistent, on-going followup.''   Vernon Bellecourt said the movement in 1988 has ``taken on a newcharacter.''   Protecting treaty rights and sacred Indian burial grounds areamong today's goals, he said, as well as protecting the interestsof Indian nations throughout the world.   Means, who has resigned, feels AIM is no longer necessary.   ``AIM people are now integrated into every productive andresponsible segment of Indian and non-Indian society,'' said Means,who lost his campaign to become Libertarian Party candidate forpresident this year. ``The American Indian Movement hasaccomplished the impossible: AIM has worked itself out of a job.''   Giago said the need for political advocacy continues. But hesaid AIM's negative image in many people's minds may hamper itsefforts.   ``We need a militant group. Somebody's got to keep stirring thepot because our numbers are so small,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
