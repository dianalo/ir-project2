For this reason, most of the mathematical models built to simulatethe environmental transport of Tc and to calculate the dose to man areassociated with conservative simplifications and produce overestimatesof the calculated dose. In order to follow the new ICRP recommendations,transfer models are needed that estimate as accurately as possible thedose to the population; this implies a better knowledge of the behaviourof Tc in the environment, especially concerning its long-term behaviour.At this time, most of the available data deal with the short-term andonly scanty results have been obtained regarding the plant-animal transfer,especially in the case of polygastric mammals.</TEXT></DOC>
