Any reference made to a section or provision of theDisaster Relief Act of 1974 (DRA) shall be deemed to be a reference tosuch section or provision of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief andEmergency Assistance Act (the Stafford Act) (renamed from DRA by DREA).The program of disaster unemployment assistance for individuals whose unemploymentis caused by a major disaster declared by the President of the United Statesis established by Section 410 (redesignated from Section 407 of the DRA)of Title IV of the Stafford Act and is referred to as the ``DUA Program.''``Disaster unemployment assistance'' benefits payable to an individualare referred to as ``DUA.'' All references to 20 CFR Part 625 refer tothe regulations in the Code of <T3>Federal Regulations</T3> published on September 16, 1977, at 42 <T4>Federal Regulations </T4>46712, as later amended. These referencesare used throughout this document.3. <T3>Background. </T3>On November 23, 1988, the President signed into lawH.R. 2707, which in Title I contains the ``Disaster Relief and EmergencyAssistance Amendments of 1988'' (the DREA). This program letter furnishesinformation concerning the provisions of Sections 103(d) and 106 (e), (f),and (l) of the DREA which affect the DUA Program. With regard to each ofthe amendments in the DREA, this document also sets forth the instructionsof the Department of Labor to the States in implementing those provisions,and which include the Department's interpretation of the DREA amendments.Under Section 112 of the DREA, the amendments therein ``shall not affectthe administration of any assistance for a major disaster declared by thePresident before'' November 23, 1988.The provisions of the DREA amendments supersede the prior provisions forthe DUA Program, and the regulations implementing the DUA Program, to theextent that the provisions of DREA are inconsistent with DRA and the implementingregulations. Therefore, the provisions of DREA must be given effect asof their effective date, as is required by Section 112 of the DREA. Inno case may any determinations of entitlement to DUA Program benefits thatare affected by the DREA amendments be based upon the prior law or theregulations implementing the prior law. However, the administration ofthe DUA Program with respect to any major disaster declared by the Presidentprior to November 23, 1988, shall continue to be controlled by the presentregulations at 20 CFR Part 625.The operating instructions in this program letter are issued to the Statesand cooperating State agencies as guidance provided by the Department ofLabor in its role as the principal in the DUA Program. As agents of theUnited States, the States and the cooperating State agencies may not varyfrom the operating instructions in this program letter (or any subsequentor supplemental operating instructions) without the prior approval of theDepartment of Labor. Pending the publication of final regulations implementingthe provisions of the DREA amendments, the operating instructions in thisdocument (and any subsequent or supplemental operating instructions) shallconstitute the controlling guidance for the States and the cooperatingState agencies in implementing and administering the provisions of theDREA amendments pursuant to the agreements or modified agreements betweenthe States and the Secretary of Labor under Section 410 of the StaffordAct. The provisions of 20 CFR 625.1(d) shall apply regarding the carryingout of the operating instructions in this document and any subsequent orsupplemental operating instructions.Amendments to the regulations at 20 CFR Part 625 will be published as soonas possible, with an opportunity for the States and the public to comment.Under Section 113 of the Act containing the Disaster Relief and EmergencyAssistance Amendments of 1988, regulations implementing the amendmentsin Title I of the Act must be published within 180 days after November23, 1988.4. <T3>The DREA Amendments_Operating Instructions. </T3>The DREA amendmentsare set out in this section, together with an explanation of each amendment,the regulations principally affected by each amendment, and additionalinstructions on the administration of each amendment. The amendments discussedin this document are effective for disasters declared on or after November23, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">A. Section 410_Unemployment Assistance</ITAG>A.1. Entitlement to Other Compensation<T3>AMENDED LAW:</T3> Section 106(f)(1) of the DREA amends Section 410(a)of the Stafford Act to provide that DUA is payable to an individual fora week of unemployment only if ``the individual is not entitled to anyother unemployment compensation (as that term is defined in Section 85(b)of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) or waiting period credit.'' Section85(b) defines the term ``unemployment compensation'' to mean ``any amountreceived under a law of the United States or of a State which is in thenature of unemployment compensation.'' As so defined, the term ``unemploymentcompensation'' includes all compensation as defined in 20 CFR 625.2(d)(1)and any unemployment compensation payable under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 85 orany Federal supplementary compensation law and trade readjustment allowances.<T3>ADMINISTRATION:</T3> This amendment means that a State having an agreementwith the Secretary to administer the DUA Program may not pay DUA to anyindividual for a week of unemployment, if the individual is entitled toany amount of unemployment compensation for the same week of unemployment,or to waiting period credit for such week. It also means that DUA is notpayable for any week the individual is not entitled to a payment of unemploymentcompensation because the individual: (1) is under a disqualification, (2)has excessive disqualifying income, (3) is employed or is not able to workor available for work, or (4) for any other reason is ineligible for unemploymentcompensation or waiting period credit the individual otherwise would beentitled to but for such ineligible reason. An individual does not havethe option of electing not to receive unemployment compensation in orderto receive DUA.The amendment changes the current practice of paying DUA for the waitingperiod on any unemployment compensation claim and providing DUA as a supplementto unemployment compensation for the same week of unemployment. This alsomeans that if an individual exhausts benefit entitlement on a claim orthe individual's benefit year ends during the disaster assistance periodand a new claim for unemployment compensation is established, any waitingperiod required is not compensable under DUA. The provisions of 20 CFR625.4 that allowed payment of DUA to individuals for any week of unemploymentprior to receipt of unemployment compensation are not longer applicableif an individual must complete a waiting period on an unemployment compensationclaim.A.2. Term of Assistance<T3>AMENDED LAW:</T3> Section 106(f)(2) of the DREA amends Section 410(a)of the Stafford Act to provide that Disaster Unemployment Assistance cannotbe paid for any period longer than ``26 weeks after the major disasteris delcared.''<T3>ADMINISTRATION:</T3> Prior to the DREA amendment, DUA was providedfor up to one year subsequent to the date the major disaster was <T3>declared</T3>. The amendment terminates the eligibility period forDUA 26 weeks after the disaster is <T3>declared</T3>, rather than one year, and the eligibility period willcommence on the first day of the first week following the date of the occurrenceof the disaster. Thus, the eligibility period may extend for more than26 weeks. The one-year eligibility period will continue to apply with respectto disasters <T3>declared</T3> prior to November 23, 1988. State agencies must now limitthe maximum duration in which DUA is payable to the 26 weeks after thedisaster is declared (plus any prior weeks of unemployment), unless a shorterperiod is established in accordance with andSection; 625.2(f) of the DUAregulations. If an individual's entitlement to unemployment compensationis exhausted prior to the ending of the disaster assistance period, aneligible individual will be entitled to DUA for the remaining weeks ofunemployment in the disaster assistance period.<T3>EXAMPLES: </T3>(1) Disaster Occurred 11/21/88. Disaster Declared 11/23/88.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Disaster Assistance PeriodBeginning Date 11/27/88. Ending Date 05/27/89.This provides for an exact 26 week disaster assistance period.(2) Disaster Occurred 11/15/88. Disaster Declared 12/07/88.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Disaster Assistance PeriodBeginning Date 11/20/88. Ending Date 06/10/89.This provides for a 29 week disaster assistance period, since there wasa 3 week period between when the disaster occurred and was declared.A.3. Repeal of Reduction in Compensation<T3>AMENDED LAW: </T3>Section 106(f)(3) of the DREA amended Section 410(a)of the Stafford Act by repealing the provision that the DUA amount calculatedand payable to an individual for a week of unemployment ``shall be reducedby any amount of unemployment compensation or of private income protectioninsurance compensation available to such individual for such week of unemployment.''<T3>ADMINISTRATION: </T3>By deleting this provision, entitlement to DUAis prohibited if an individual is entitled to unemployment compensationbecause of the amendment discussed in A.1. If an individual is entitledto any unemployment compensation, such individual is not entitled to DUAfor the same week of unemployment, irrespective of the weekly amount. However,the income reductions to the amount of DUA payable for a week which areprovided for at 20 CFR 625.13(a) would still be applied.A.4. Reemployment Assistance<T3>AMENDED LAW: </T3>Section 106(f)(4) of the DREA amends Section 410(b)of the Stafford Act to provide under subsection (b)(1) that ``[a] Stateshall provide, without reimbursement from any funds provided under thisAct, reemployment assistance services under any other law administeredby the State to individuals receiving benefits under this section.'' Subsection(b)(2) provides that ``[t]he President may provide [Federal] reemploymentassistance services under other laws to individuals who are unemployedas a result of a major disaster and who reside in a State which does notprovide such services.''<T3>ADMINISTRATION: </T3>20 CFR 625.3 provides that individuals applyingfor DUA and all other individuals unemployed because of a major disastershall be afforded employment services. This provision remains effectivein those States providing such services. Since the services are providedto all workers that are employed or unemployed and are already administrativelyfinanced, no reimbursement can be provided for reemployment assistanceservices to individuals unemployed because of a major disaster.In the case of those jurisdictions defined in the DUA regulations as a``State,'' that do not offer ``reemployment assistance'' as intended bythe DREA amendments, the Department will determine what services and/orprograms are needed, and if any available Federal programs of reemploymentassistance can be implemented in that jurisdiction.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Section 423_Appeals of Assistance Decisions</ITAG>B.1. Right of Apeal, Period for Decisions, Rules<T3>AMENDED LAW: </T3>Section 106(1) of the DREA amends Title IV) of theStafford Act by adding a new section, Section 423. This section providesa right of appeal from any decision regarding ``eligibility for, form,or amount of assistance'' under Title IV, within 60 days after the dateon which the applicant is notified of the award or denial of assistance.Subsection (b) of this new section requires that a decision regarding suchan appeal will be rendered within 90 days after the date on which the Federalofficial designated to administer such appeals receives notice of the appeal.Subsection (c) of this new section requires the President to issue ruleswhich provide for the fair and impartial consideration of these appeals.<T3>Administration: </T3>This amendment causes significant changes in theDUA appellate procedures as set out in 20 CFR 625.10, although the presentregulations will continue to apply to appeal and review of DUA determinationsissued with respect to disasters declared prior to November 23, 1988. First,the period for filing an appeal from a determination or redeterminationwill change from the amount of time permitted by the applicable State unemploymentcompensation law to 60 days. The fair and impartial hearing and decisionwill continue to be administered by State UI hearing officers. However,it will be necessary for <T3>all </T3>DUA appeals to be decided by State hearing officers within30 days of appeal. As provided in the DUA regulations at andSection;625.10(d)(2),the applicant will be allowed to appeal the State UI hearing officer'sdecision to the appropriate Regional Administrator within 15 days afterthe hearing officer's decision was delivered or mailed to the individual.The Regional Administrator will have 45 days to obtain the record belowfrom the State and to issue a decision on the appeal. Therefore, a decisioncan be made by ``* * * the Federal official designated to administer suchappeals * * *'' within 90 days after the day on which the applicant's originalappeal was received. It will be imperative for the hearing and decision by State hearing officersto be completed within 30 days, so that there will be time for the RegionalAdministrator to act prior to the expiration of the 90-day period allowed.The Secretary's Standard for appeals promptness does not apply to thisFederally mandated provision. States must ensure that the appropriate timeframes for filing appeals are conveyed on or with all determinations anddecisions affecting eligibility for or amount of DUA that may be at issue.The procedures for further review by the Assistant Secretary for Employmentand Training are the same as set out in 20 CFR 625.10(e). Also, as setout in 20 CFR 625.10(d), a State agency also may appeal to the RegionalAdministrator, and the Regional Administrator may review a case on hisor her own motion. <ITAG tagnum="84">Other </ITAG>Section 103(d) of the DREA also amended paragraphs 3 and 4 of section 102of the Stafford Act to delete ``the Canal Zone'' from the definitions of``United States'' and ``State''. Therefore, since the definition of State no longer includes the Canal Zone,all regulations and operating procedures related to the Canal Zone arenot applicable to disasters declared on or after November 23, 1988. 5. <T3>Action Required. </T3>States are required to implement the provisionsof the DREA amendments as set forth in this document and in any other guidanceissued by the Department, for all major disasters declared on or afterNovember 23, 1988. States are advised to inform all appropriate staff ofthe contents of this document. 6. <T3>Inquiries </T3>States are to direct all inquiries to the appropriateRegional Office.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-7005 Filed 3-23-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-30-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
