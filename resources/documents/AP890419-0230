In 1988, the small-aircraft industry reported its first increasein a decade of both the number and value of planes delivered. Thefigures cover sales of civilian planes that carry fewer than 20passengers and generally are not used by scheduled airlines.   The first-quarter report released Tuesday by the GeneralAviation Manufacturers Association, based on delivery of aircraft,showed 212 single-engine planes sold, compared with 165 in theyear-ago quarter.   Sales of jet planes dropped from 34 to 23, while turboprop saleswere down from 52 to 51 and twin-engine aircraft from 23 to 18.   Sales reached $302.97 million for the first quarter, comparedwith $377.46 for the first quarter of 1988, and the value ofaircraft sold abroad dropped to $97.5 million from last year's$158.52 million for the quarter, the association reported.   ``The increase in total aircraft deliveries is an encouragingsign,'' said Edward M. Stimpson, the association's president. But,he said, the industry has been ``devastated by unfair productliability laws.'' The association supports bills introduced inCongress that would limit the liability of manufacturers.   Stimpson said increased funding to modernize airports is alsoneeded for the industry to grow.   The association represents 36 manufacturers of aircraft, enginesand related equipment.</TEXT></DOC>
