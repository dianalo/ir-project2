Inside a small, dark apartment in a pre-fabricated Moscowhigh-rise, 18 women and four of their children gathered to begin thethird annual hunger strike organized by a group called Jewish WomenAgainst Refusal.   The date they chose for the beginning of their three-day fast wassymbolic: March 8 is International Women's Day in the Soviet Union,a national holiday.   The hunger strikers, who were packed into a modest living room,said they feared the international popularity of President MikhailS. Gorbachev's reforms, known as ``perestroika,'' diverts attentionfrom their plight.   ``We are very afraid now because the Soviet Union does everythingpossible to attract attention to perestroika, and many people acrossthe world are deceived,'' said Judith Lurie of Moscow.   ``It's true that many changes have taken place in this country _but it's far from being a law-governed state,'' said Lurie, 46, whohas been refused an exit visa for 10 years.   Lurie's family was given exit visas in 1979, but the authoritesrevoked them on the grounds of state secrecy because her husbandworked in a classified job as a organic chemistry researcher for twoyears in the 1960s, she said.   At least 48 women and several children are taking part in thehunger strike in nine cities, including Leningrad, Kiev, Minsk, Rigaand Irkutsk, said Inna Ioffe, whose apartment was one of twogathering spots in Moscow for the hunger strikers.   The women in her apartment shared the details of their cases,dried each other's tears and wrote letters to first ladies BarbaraBush and Raisa Gorbachev to ask their support.   About half of the hunger strikers have been denied exit visas onthe grounds of secrecy, Ioffe said. The Soviets have told them theycannot leave because they or a relative have been exposed to statesecrets, she said.   The other half, known as ``poor relatives,'' have been deniedpermission to leave because their parents or divorced spouses havefailed to certify they have no financial claims on the would-beemigrants, she said.   One hunger striker was joined in the fast by her twin 13-year-olddaughters. The family has not been allowed to emigrate to Israelbecause the girls' father refuses to sign the necessary forms.   ``Our former father cast us off when I was 5 years old. Wehaven't seen him since, and he's absolutely uninterested in us. Butwhen Mom applied to emigrate, he called and said he loves us verymuch,'' said Vicka Prilutskaya, one of the twins.   ``Our father says while he lives he won't let us go,'' said theteen-ager, who wore a Star of David around her neck and an Israeliflag pin on her sweater.   Tamara Gurfink, 56, sobbed as she told her story.   ``My only son emigrated to New York and I haven't seen him innine years,'' said Gurfink, as she pulled two photos of her son outof her wallet.   ``I ask only to be allowed to go and be a guest of my son, but Iam refused,'' said Gurfink, who said she has not been allowed toleave on the grounds of state secrecy.   The participants said they hope the hunger strike will encouragethe international community to pressure Soviet leaders to write lawsforcing officials to deal with cases individually and be more just.   Ioffe said she has been told she cannot emigrate because her76-year-old mother-in-law, who also wants to emigrate, was exposedto state secrets in her work as a botanist.   More than 20,000 Soviet Jews were allowed permission to emigratein 1988, which was an eight-year high. The highest exodus, 51,328,was recorded in 1979.   It's difficult to estimate how many Soviet Jews have been deniedexit visas. The Council for Soviet Jewry, a group sponsored by theIsraeli government, estimates the number at 3,600.   Yuri Semenovsky, denied an exit visa for three years, says 80,000Soviet Jews had their applications for exit visas refused last year.   And there are new refuseniks.   Ira Khrustalova, 41, one of the hunger strikers, said she hadjust received her notice of refusal Tuesday.   ``These three hunger strikes have all been during the years ofperestroika,'' said Ioffe. ``Everyone talks a lot about all thechanges due to perestroika, but the situation in emigration is stillthe same.''</TEXT></DOC>
