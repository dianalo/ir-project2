The factory also can't buy air conditioners for the swelteringsummers and this past winter went days without heat because of alack of coal.   ``We send out special teams to look for coal,'' she said, addingthat they sometimes must pay free market sellers and profiteers upto 130 yuan ($35) a ton for it, three times the state-set rate.   Xinghua is forced to shut down once a six-day week, everyFriday, in the midst of the worst energy crisis in CommunistChina's 40-year history.   But it is more fortunate than factories in the key industrialcities of Shanghai and Shenyang, which operate only three or fourdays of their usual six-day week. In parts of Jiangsu province,another industrial center near Shanghai, up to a third of thefactories were closed and 40 percent of the power plants hadstopped working at the end of the year because of coal shortages.   In Beijing, 500 factories employing 100,000 now operate only onnight shifts because they have no power during the day.   Not only factories are affected.   In Beijing, a city of 10 million people, elevators in high-risebuildings don't work, new color televisions sit idle and peoplestock up on candles.   The official Guangming Daily noted that even the headquarters ofthe Energy Resources Ministry has been ordered to shut off allelectrical appliances every Thursday.   China has been losing an average 200 billion yuan ($54 billion)a year during the 1980s due to power cuts. Last year the losseswere believed to be double that as up to one-third of productioncapacity was unused.   The crisis reflects the inability of energy production to matchthe nation's explosive industrial growth. Industrial outputincreased by more than 20 percent in 1988, but production of coal,used for 70 percent of China's energy, was up only 4 percent.   Energy supplies have also failed to cope with China's new-foundprosperity which has resulted in a surge of demand for televisions,refrigerators, microwaves and other electrical appliances. InBeijing last year, energy consumption by households jumped 29percent, while power supply was up by only 3 percent.   The Guangming Daily noted that one large luxury hotel in Beijingtoday consumes as much energy as all of Beijing did in the early1950s.   Another problem is that China, although the world's largestproducer of coal with 970 million tons last year, can't get thepower to the places it is needed.   Most of the nation's coal is mined in the north, but industry iscentered mainly along the southern coast. Half the country's badlyovertaxed railway system and a third of river transport is devotedto carrying coal, but that still wasn't enough. Last year about 8million tons, or 3.5 percent of the state coal supply quota, wasnot delivered.   According to a report in the weekly publication Outlook(Liaowang), one large coal mine in Shanxi province, in the heart ofcoal country, had to stop operations temporarily because it lackedfuel to run its bulldozers.   Low investment in energy industries, inefficient small mines andartificially low state-set prices for energy have widened the gapbetween supply and demand. Profiteering by officials with access tocoal supplies _ even in the army _ is pandemic.   Coal should sell for the state-price equivalent of $8 to $11 aton but it goes for $54 to $80 after passing through the hands ofvarious middlemen on its way to Shanghai or Canton.   The government is considering various possible solutions,including more investment in energy production, higher taxes forenergy use and higher energy prices, to achieve what appears to bean impossible goal of producing 1.5 billion tons of coal by theyear 2000.   China now has no nuclear power but is building two plants alongthe southern coast and has plans for others.   As a stopgap measure, the government is hoping that its harshausterity campaign begun last fall will slow the economy downenough to relieve the energy crisis.   ``If we consider energy to be the lifeblood of modern society,''the Guangming Daily said, ``today's China can be compared to apatient suffering from anemia.''</TEXT></DOC>
