On the basis ofsimple trigonometric formulas it is possible to get an accuracy of +-1 mm. By means of the standard software of a high precision CT and withCT-compatible stereotactic apparatus the x, y and z coordinates are obtainedin a quick and reliable way. A further development of the trigonometricapproach to the stereotactic calcualation is the double target technique.it allows to present the path of the biopsy-device through a selectedpoint, to reach the final target: in this way a valuable reduction ofthe surgical risk is afforded especially in critical areas of the brain(brain stem, pineal region, etc.). 18 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
