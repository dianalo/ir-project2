Also on Wednesday, about 2,000 radical students battled riotpolice at two universities to protest a government ban onparticipation in an international youth festival in North Korea.   The Agency for National Security Planning said Suh Kyung-won ofthe Party for Peace and Democracy was arrested for secretly visitingNorth Korea in August and meeting with the nation's leader, Kim IlSung.   Suh's party, South Korea's largest opposition group, apologizedand called his trip ``a reckless act.''   Suh, 52, was charged with violating the National Security Law,which carries a maximum sentence of death, security officials said.   President Roh Tae-woo said Suh's trip to Pyongyang was ``a reallyshocking incident'' and called for firm measures against the leftistmovement.   He also dismissed calls by radical students for the withdrawal ofthe 43,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea under a mutualdefense treaty. Roh said the troops contribute to peace andstability.   About 1,500 radical students from Seoul and other cities gatheredat Hanyang University in the capital and clashed with about 3,500riot police.   ``Punish Roh Tae-woo!'' groups of masked students shouted as theymarched and attacked police with firebombs, rocks and clubs.   Police responded with barrages of tear gas and threw back rockshurled by students. Authorities said dozens of officers sufferedminor injuries.   Police arrested more than 100 students trying to enter theschool, they said.   Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, reported similar clashes atHannam University in the city of Taejon, where police blocked about600 students from leaving for Seoul.   Student protesters have called for marches to Panmunjom, theborder truce village in the demilitarized zone, to press theirdemand to be allowed to participate in the weeklong North Koreanfestival, which begins Saturday in Pyongyang.   Students say they want to attend the festival to help advanceunification. Seoul accuses North Korea of using the festival todramatize its demand for the withdrawal of U.S. forces.   South Koreans have been barred from visiting North Korea withoutgovernment permission since the nations fought the Korean war from1950-53. Korea was divided in 1945 at the end of World War II.   Security officials charged Wednesday there are about 10,000leftists in South Korea seeking revolution and unification withNorth Korea. They said leftists and communists in South Koreadominate 26 dissident, religious, labor, student and other groups.</TEXT></DOC>
