Our purpose was to try to change his mind about supporting a two-year cut in the tax rate on capital gains (the &quot;Jenkins plan&quot;).    We had many reasons. The Jenkins plan provides its benefits overwhelmingly to the unneedful rich: 60% of benefits would go to persons with more than $200,000 in income, conferring upon each of them an average tax cut of $9,500. There is no evidence of likely positive economic effects from the plan: The main source of finance for venture capital is pension funds and other tax-exempt institutional investors, which are not affected by capital gains taxation. Finally, we worried that the inclusion of commercial property in the break might ignite a sudden sale of real estate, deepening the severe slump in our local market, already among the most depressed in the country.    For all of this, the Jenkins plan may fail to raise any revenue, despite its backers' promises. While the Joint Tax Committee has estimated a $2.1 billion revenue gain for 1990 from the two-year cut, the Congressional Budget Office warns that this effect depends on estimates of induced changes in asset sales, which are highly conjectural. All agree, moreover, that whatever revenue the Treasury may gain from the plan in the short run, it will lose after 1991 -- modestly if the tax rate on capital gains is restored; drastically if the cut is extended.    None of these points is new. However, we too learned from our meeting. What we learned had to do with the special political circumstances that make the Jenkins Plan, and schemes like it, attractive to Congress.    There is now before the Ways and Means Committee, it develops, a list of special tax provisions due to expire. These include tax credits for purposes ranging from child care to mortgage revenue bonds to housing rehabilitation to research and development -- all worthy.    Now, under the Gramm-Rudman procedures, none of these &quot;extenders&quot; can be added by the Ways and means Committee, unless the Committee offsets the projected revenue loss for fiscal year 1990 with some other revenue gain. The president is firmly committed: no new taxes (this year). And here is the appeal of the Jenkins plan. Whether or not it will actually raise revenues in the short run, and never mind the fact that it will surely lose revenues massively after 1991, the Jenkins Plan is projected to raise revenues in 1990. It thus provides the running room, under the Gramm-Rudman procedures, that would permit the Ways and Means Committee to fund the &quot;extenders.&quot;    Since none of the alternative capital gains proposals, like indexing, do this, they are noncontenders. We have here, in other words, a tax cut to finance another tax cut.    What the Jenkins plan really illustrates is the sad state and corrupting influence of the Gramm-Rudman procedures. That law, whose purpose was to force steady progress toward a balanced budget, has now reached the limits of legislative tolerance for cuts and sacrifice. Yet the secular religion of budget-balancing remains strong, and no one wishes to say openly that the law is a ass. Instead, Gramm-Rudman's supporters have quietly given up the fight, and joined forces with traditional politics in schemes to take advantage of a loophole.    The loophole lies in the fact that adherence to Gramm-Rudmann's targets is required only in the projections for the fiscal year budget under consideration. If expenditures are added to a fiscal year already under way, the law interposes no objections, as with the savings and loan bailout. And if revenues are cut or spending increased for fiscal years in the future, the law's attitude is also benign. Gramm-Rudman in its present form thus places a premium on schemes that help &quot;muddle through&quot; the budget for the currently upcoming fiscal year. The Jenkins Plan is not alone in serving this purpose: So too does the practice of deferring capital and maintenance expenditures from the highway trust fund, at the risk of building up even larger deficits for future years.    There are economic consequences. Careful economists have long recognized that expected future deficits, not merely the present-year deficit, are among the forces that drive up long-term interest rates. That being so, schemes like the Jenkins plan pose a double hazard for asset markets. Not only do they threaten a selloff of long-term stock and bond holdings that could cause a price crash, they add to that potential mayhem by driving up interest rates and so deterring real investment.    What to do? One cannot, of course, expect congressmen to forgo opportunities like those created by Gramm-Rudman and the Jenkins plan. But one can hope that they will recognize the high costs of allowing these opportunities to arise, and that they will then change the rules, and so restructure their incentives. Herewith three suggestions.    First, Congress should close the Gramm-Rudman loophole, and require a complete offset of new expenditures or tax reductions over the full five-year planning horizon. This would eliminate the Jenkins plan and trust fund abuses. Similarly, a 60% vote might be required before new spending could be packed into a previously legislated fiscal year. That would eliminate routine backdating, and also force Congress to deal honestly with emergencies like the Sandamp;L bailout, when necessary, by exempting them outright from GrammRudman.    Second, Congress should revise the Gramm-Rudman trajectories, eliminating the foolish, pointless and unattainable goal of zero official deficit by 1993. That should be replaced with a reasonable and feasible benchmark, such as stabilizing the share of public debt in GNP. As it happens, this objective has already been roughly achieved. A stricter but more technical alternative could be reached within a few years without letting future deficits get out of hand.    Finally, Congress should make the choices easier by raising income taxes, beginning with the top rate. The effective date of such a change can be delayed, to make it consistent with the president's pledge of &quot;no new taxes&quot; (this year). Then, and only then, the Democratic leadership and the Republican president might sit down and discuss what the real problems and priorities are. There are some things, gentlemen - -drugs, education, homelessness, the environment -- that could use a little of your attention.    ---   Mr. Galbraith, who teaches at the University of Texas's Johnson School of Public Affairs, is author of &quot;Balancing Acts: Technology, Finance and the American Future&quot; (Basic Books, 1989). </TEXT></DOC>
