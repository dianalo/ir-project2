(Semicon West)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Runyon, Stan.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Teradyne and Analog Devices have linked the former's Image testsimulator and the latter's Spectrum design simulator in an effortto shorten application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)development time.andP;  Teradyne will demonstrate the linked pair, thefirst such linkage based entirely on mixed-signal packages, atSemicon West, to be held in San Mateo, CA, during the week of May20, 1991.andP;  Engineers at the two companies linked the simulatorsthrough the creation of an event-description language that isessentially a highly compressed version of the test program.andP;  Thelanguage introduces the same events to the simulated device that areal device would see if plugged into the tester, with theadvantage that the time spent passing data between the simulatorsis greatly reduced.andP;  Problems are diagnosed by stepping throughboth the Image test program and Spectrum simulation files.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   Teradyne Inc.
