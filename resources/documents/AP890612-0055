The offer came in a message to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir fromEgyptian President Hosni Mubarak. It was delivered in a privatemeeting by the visiting Egyptian minister of state for foreignaffairs, Butros Ghali.   Ghali is the only leading Egyptian official to visit Israel sincethe start of the Palestinian uprising.   ``I'm ready to be a good and active postman,'' Ghali told about30 prominent Palestinians at a breakfast meeting in Herzliya.   After 90 minutes of talks with Ghali in Jerusalem, Arensresponded that there was no need for a middleman and no desire fortalks with the PLO. Israel refuses to negotiate with the PLO,considering it a terrorist organization.   ``There is no need for mediation,'' Arens said. ``I think theEgyptians understand that we are convinced...that the peace processneeds to be advanced through direct negotiations and not throughmediation.''   A senior Israeli official who requested anonymity said Shamirtold Mubarak's envoy he would welcome Egyptian efforts to persuadePalestinians to accept Israel's plan for holding elections in theWest Bank and Gaza Strip. The PLO has rejected Shamir's plan, underwhich Palestinians would elect non-PLO representatives to negotiatelimited autonomy for the occupied territories.   ``Any positive influence Egypt could exert on the Palestinianshere would be beneficial,'' the official quoted Shamir as saying.But he added the PLO was not a partner and, ``We don't needmediation with them.''   Asked about differences between the Egyptian and Israeli stancetoward the Palestine Liberation Organization, Arens said that Israelsees the PLO as ``the major obstacle to progress for peace in thearea.''   ``It is our position that anything which enhances the image ofthe PLO is not a positive development in the peace process,'' Arenssaid.   Egypt is the only Arab country that maintains diplomatic tieswith Israel.   Ghali also suggested Egypt's Embassy in Tel Aviv play a mediatingrole between Palestinians and the PLO if such a move was requestedby Arabs in the occupied land, said Radwan Abu Ayash, head of theArab Journalists Association.   Several prominent Palestinians did not attend the meeting. Somesaid they received threats from radical PLO faction, while othersboycotted the session because it was held in Israel instead of inArab east Jerusalem.   Also today, the Israeli daily Haaretz reported the army willextend the maximum period under which Arabs can be jailed withouttrial from six months to a year. Currently, 1,508 Palestinians arebeing held without trial in Israeli detention centers and 5,000Arabs have been held since the uprising began.   The so-called administrative detention has been stronglycriticized by the United States as a violation of the right to dueprocess before the law.</TEXT></DOC>
