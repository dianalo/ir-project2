American International, a large New York-based insurer, isresponsible for a large portion of the performance bonds forFischbach, a troubled electrical and mechanical contractingconcern based in New York. While an American Internationalspokesman said he couldn't estimate the dollar amount of theperformance bonds issued to Fischbach, the total reportedlyis about $600 million.</LP><TEXT>   Performance or surety bonds usually guarantee thatconstruction projects for municipalities and other entitiesare completed as promised.   American International officials weren't available lateyesterday to explain the status of the work guaranteed bythese bonds and how recent these commitments were.   American International also said it plans to bring in aconstruction company to provide management consultingservices to loss-ridden Fischbach as soon as AmericanInternational can obtain approval from Fischbach's board.   In addition, APL Corp., controlled by Miami financierVictor Posner, said it and American International modifiedthe terms of American International's previously announcedoption to acquire APL's approximately 54% stake in Fischbachto set a new exercise price of $11 a share.   APL also said it agreed to recommend approval of themerger proposal to Fischbach's board, which APL said isplanning to meet next week to consider the matter.   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,Fischbach closed at $9.75, unchanged. Fischbach officialscouldn't be reached for comment.   American International said the proposed merger would besubject to approval of Fischbach's board and other customaryconditions.   Mr. Posner couldn't be reached for comment, but he may ruethe day he became involved with Fischbach. He paid far morefor the shares than the $11-a-share option he gave toAmerican International. And the manner in which he acquiredcontrol has proven to be part of one of Wall Street's mosthigh-profile scandals.   According to testimony by Michael Milken, the formerjunk-bond king who pleaded guilty last month to six felonies,one of his misdeeds was forcing an unwilling Fischbach intothe hands of Mr. Posner by having Ivan Boesky take a largeand unlawfully secret position in the company's stock.   Analysts were puzzled by American International'sannouncement yesterday. One said that if a contractor can'tcomplete a job, insurers would typically pay the claims, butnot take over the entire contracting company.   Another person familiar with Fischbach believes AmericanInternational's move is &quot;purely defensive,&quot; as the insurerwould probably like to oversee the management of Fischbach asa way of guarding against possible future claims against itsperformance bonds.   In an interview with The Wall Street Journal lastDecember, Maurice Greenberg, chairman of AmericanInternational, said the company has been an insurer of&quot;Posner enterprises for a number of years and withsatisfactory results.&quot;   Mr. Greenberg also said last December that AmericanInternational could hold on to Fischbach as an investment oract &quot;as a facilitator,&quot; possibly selling it to another entitythat would be interested in the contracting business.</TEXT></DOC>
