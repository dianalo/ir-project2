Under the bill, Renault would change from being a state agency to a commercial company, albeit a state-owned one, according to Industry Minister Alain Madelin. The government would write off part of Renault's debt but would also cut some fiscal privileges as part of a broad plan to make Renault obey normal market conditions rather than rely on the state.    Though highly technical, the move is considered important here because it means that Renault, for its future development, would have to &quot;seek financing from financial markets and not rely on the taxpayer,&quot; Mr. Madelin said.    This, top officials said, means that Renault, which has been state-owned since 1945, could eventually open up its capital to the public through a share issue, amove described by one official as &quot;the antechamber of privatization.&quot;    Government officials here view the bill as a symbolic demonstration of their determination to let the laws of the market govern the fate of French industry.    In the past few weeks, the government was reported to be having second thoughts about this plan, which was being studied this summer, because it ran into heavy criticism from the publicly traded Peugeot S.A. group, which feels the plan distorts competition. But Mr. Madelin said yesterday that the bill, which was proposed several months ago, is ready to be submitted to the Council of State, a legal watchdog body, and should be sent to parliament for a vote before the end of the year.    Nevertheless, Peugeot is likely to object to several provisions in the plan, despite the government's assurances that many of Peugeot's criticisms have been addressed. Moreover, the European Community Commission says it will scrutinize the plan to see if it is compatible with the EC's code governing state aid to companies.    Indeed, the government's plan amounts to a form of indirect state aid that could be considered unfair competition. But the French government argues that for Renault to be able to stand on its own feet, it first has to be propped up. Renault has accumulated losses exceeding 30 billion francs ($5.05 billion) in the past six years and currently has a negative net worth -- meaning its liabilities exceed its assets -- of 16.4 billion francs. Although Renault is set to return to profit this year, officials said that if its legal status was changed while its net worth is negative, it would be bankrupt.    Therefore, the government will offset the difference between Renault's profit and its remaining negative net worth by writing off between eight billion francs and 12 billion francs of Renault's debt, which totaled 56 billion francs at the end of 1986. The amount depends on how high Renault's profits are over the next two years. If the government writes off only eight billion francs of debt, it means it's confident Renault will earn eight billion francs over the next two years -- more than was expected initially. Renault Chairman Raymond Levy has said only that he expects profits of &quot;at least one billion francs&quot; this year.    At the same time, however, the state will wipe out a &quot;large part&quot; of Renault's so-called &quot;fiscal carry-forward,&quot; which allows it to refrain from paying taxes until it makes profits equivalent to its cumulative losses plus other expenses, totaling 40.4 billion francs.    This move is regarded here as a sop to Peugeot, as is the government's decision to write off part of Renault's debt rather than directly inject fresh funds into Renault.    Indeed, Peugeot Chairman Jacques Calvet is extremely unhappy that Renault's recovery is being helped by the state, while he had to turn around Peugeot alone, and he said that state aid to Renault gives it an unfair competitive edge. While Peugeot officials prefer a debt write-off to a direct cash injection, they argue that this still frees up resources for Renault that would otherwise be used to pay back debt. Peugeot says that changing Renault's status without privatizing it amounts to no change because it will still have the state behind it.    But government officials said that they are only doing their job as a shareholder and that the status change removes the &quot;comprehensive insurance policy&quot; provided by the state. They said they will pledge to the EC that this plan will mark the last time Renault receives state aid, and that after this, Renault will have to rely on the market.    &quot;The certainty that we're not providing any fresh cash, that we're wiping out Renault's fiscal benefits and our commitment to Brussels&quot; should satisfy both the EC and Peugeot, one top official said. And, he added, Renault will still be far from saved: &quot;We're sending them into the big leagues with 40 billion francs left in debt, zero net worth and no more state guarantee.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
