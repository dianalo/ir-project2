Little was known regarding the toxicologicaleffects of exposure to diesel emissions, the components of diesel exhaust,or their physical characteristics. Although a number of epidemiologicalstudies had been completed, none showed a causal relationship betweenexposure to diesel exhaust and an increased incidence in lung cancer.There were no well-conducted studies in experimental animals which indicateda cancer hazard by any route of administration. A broad-range researchprogram was initiated to study the mutagenic and carcinogenic effectsof diesel engine emissions and other related complex-mixture samples.These studies featured a combined approach of analytical chemistry, genetictoxicity bioassay, and tumor bioassay to fully characterize both thecomplex mixtures themselves as well as individual components which mightbe responsible for biological activities. This paper summarizes the approachestaken and the results obtained and cities previously published data.Also presented are some current research efforts aimed at furtheringour knowledge of these relationships.</TEXT></DOC>
