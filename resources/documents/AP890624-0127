They also said a Palestinian suspected of collaborating withIsrael was killed at a detention center in the occupied Gaza Strip.   Israeli authorities said a U.S. relief worker, kidnapped in theGaza Strip and released Friday after being held for 30 hours,apparently cooperated with his Palestinian captors. Israeli radiodescribed the victim, Chris George, 35, as ``hostile toward Israel''and Israeli television said security authorities were consideringtaking unspecified measure against him.   The army said ``many suspects'' were arrested in the raids onseveral West Bank villages.   Arab reporters said that four women ages 19 to 46 were shot andwounded in the arms and legs during a raid on the village of Jaba.   They said women rushed to the streets and protested when soldiersordered males ages 12 to 45 to the village school's courtyard.Troops then beat some of the men, the reporters said.   An army spokesman said soldiers encountered ``a violentresistance by Jaba residents'' and wounded three Palestinians inclashes.   The army command confirmed a total of six wounded in the raids.Arab hospital officials said at least seven were wounded.   At the Ketziot detention center in the Gaza Strip, a 23-year-oldPalestinian carried the body of Mohammed Faraj Abu Jadalla out of atent, threw it in front of a guard and said he strangled Jadallabecause the man collaborated with Israeli authorities, the newsagency Itim said.   Palestinian reporters said the 22-year-old detainee was beatenand strangled.   At least 65 suspected collaborators are among the 531Palestinians killed in the 18{-month uprising against Israeli ruleof the occupied lands. Twenty-three Israelis also have died.   Palestinians in the territories heeded calls from the Moslemfundamentalist Hamas movement and staged a general strike onSaturday to protest the desecration of the Holy Koran by Israelisoldiers.   A soldier recently used pages of a Koran as toilet paper. Helater said he could not read Arabic and apologized publicly.   In scattered clashes in Gaza, soldiers shot and wounded at leastfour Palestinians, Arab hospital officials reported. The army saidit was checking the reports.   George, co-director of the Save the Children Foundation, waskidnapped Thursday by three men. After his release, he said hisabduction was ``not only immoral but also a criminal act.''   A senior Israeli security official, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said, ``It is clear that George did not stage thekidnapping itself, but he apparently cooperated with the abductorsfrom the moment he was taken.''   Israel television's Arabic-language broadcast said securityauthorities were considering taking measures against George but itdid not elaborate.   George was not available for comment Saturday.</TEXT></DOC>
