In &quot;Baghdad Without a Map: And  OtherMisadventures in Arabia&quot; (Dutton, 276 pages, $19.95), hedescribes Lebanon under siege, Islamic fashion and theAyatollah's grief-crazed funeral, along with chapters oneveryday life in pre-war Iraq.   On the Great Leader: &quot;Beneath Baghdad's war memorial was amuseum to Saddam's life, including a family tree tracing hisancestry to Mohammed, his birth certificate and fifth-gradereport card (he scored an 89 in history, his best subject).Not featured though perhaps more revealing of his childhoodmilieu, is a pamphlet authored by his foster father,Khairalla Tulfah, titled `Three Whom God Should Not HaveCreated: Persians, Jews and Flies.'&quot;</LP><TEXT>   On Life in Baghdad: &quot;Exactly how many Iraqi souls had beensacrificed in the eight-year war remained a mystery. Twohundred thousand dead was the most common estimate, astaggering toll in a nation of only sixteen million people.Certain streets of Baghdad looked the way I imagined Berlinor Paris did in the 1920s. Young amputees gathered at theBabel Cinema, leaning their stumps on crutches as theystudied posters for Bruce Lee films. Veterans rolled throughthe souk in wheelchairs, shopping piled on their plasticlegs.&quot;   On the Map Problem: &quot;Like the weather report, maps werebanned because they could aid the Iranians in aiming theirmissiles at the Iraqi capital. Maps could also, of course,aid dissidents in plotting assassinations or coups.&quot;   On Public Art: &quot;One fresh sculpture rivaled the Colossusof Rhodes, four stories high, with Saddam's outstretched armcasting a shadow the length of a football field. Even Iraqisseemed stunned by its size. `Normally you must be dead beforethey put up something so big,' a cabbie confided, stalled inthe traffic beneath the statue's promethean gaze.&quot;   On Iraq's History: &quot;Since 1920, there have beentwenty-three coups, not counting the scores of attemptedrevolts, such as the one Saddam joined in 1959 . . . Sixteenyears, two coups, and many purges later, Saddam muscled hisway into the presidency. He celebrated the event bysentencing twenty-two of his closest conspirators to death ontrumped-up charges of treason . . . Ever since then, AmnestyInternational's annual reports on Iraq have read liketranscripts from the Spanish Inquisition: prisoners fedslow-acting poison, children tortured into ratting on theirparents, teenagers returned dead to their families withfingernails extracted and eyes gouged out.&quot;   On Returning to Baghdad After the Invasion of Kuwait: &quot;Anight out in Baghdad was never my idea of a good time. But itdepressed me that what little vitality the city oncepossessed was now draining away so fast. War or no war, Iraqseemed destined to become a desert Albania: destitute andlifeless, forever armored against the outside world. Butthen, anything is possible. Ten months before, on a rawChristmas night in the Romanian town of Timisoara, I'd seenan ill-clad and crooked-toothed mob rush into the street tocelebrate the news that the dictator Ceausescu was dead.&quot;   ---   In &quot;Beyond Our Means,&quot; Alfred L. Malabre Jr., who reportson the economy for the Journal, took a dim view of the Reaganyears. Now, in &quot;Within Our Means: The Struggle for EconomicRecovery After a Reckless Decade&quot; (Random House, 167 pages,$21), he sees an American heartland darkened by the heavycloud of debt and quaking under a crumbling infrastructure.&quot;The jig is up,&quot; he insists in this book, which reviews therecent past while offering suggestions for renewal andrepair.   On the Main Problem: &quot;As the 1990s began, about 90 percentof the total aftertax income of U.S. corporations went to paythe interest on their debt. This buildup of debt at everylevel was a ticking time bomb for Bush, set to go off in anymajor new downturn of the business cycle.&quot;   On Reagan: &quot;American living standards, in sum,deteriorated in crucial ways during Reagan's presidency, andit is remarkable that the decline did not bring moreattention in the media or concern at the ballot box. That itdid not was in large measure a tribute to an old, appealingactor's undiminished Hollywood skills.&quot;   On Why Our Deficit Is Worse Than Japan's or Germany's:&quot;One reason why was that in the United States the rate ofsavings was generally far lower than overseas, and financinga deficit tends, of course, to weigh less heavily whensavings are plentiful. Another factor was that in the UnitedStates, more than overseas, the deficits were largely usedfor purposes other than productivity. Maintaining theinfrastructure, for instance, was generally accorded a higherpriority in the Japanese and West German budgets . . .&quot;   On What to Do: &quot;. . . the task will entail someself-inflicted pain -- higher taxes, less federal largess,tighter regulation of business activity.&quot;   What Else?: &quot;Congress also should give the president theauthority to exercise so-called line-item vetoes.&quot;   &quot;Cutting the tax rate on capital gains would also raisethe incentive to save. . . .&quot;   &quot;. . . take the ceiling off the Social Security tax. . ..&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
