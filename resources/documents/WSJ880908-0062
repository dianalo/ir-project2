There's probably no other area where the views of the two presidential candidates are as starkly opposed. Philosophically, they are poles apart in their approach to the Third World, producing diametrically opposed positions on problems from Africa to Central America.    Mr. Dukakis calls for full economic sanctions against South Africa to force an end to apartheid; Mr. Bush says he wouldn't impose any more sanctions. Mr. Dukakis would end aid to rebels fighting the leftist governments of Nicaragua and Angola; Mr. Bush would push for continued aid to both insurgencies.    Mr. Dukakis says the U.S. has to stop acting on its own in Third World conflicts and start working more through such international organizations as the United Nations and the Organization of American States. Mr. Bush scoffs at the idea of relying on such &quot;multilateralism.&quot;    In this campaign the candidates sometimes resort to hyperbole when discussing the economy, or seize on symbolic issues like the Pledge of Allegiance, to make the differences between them appear bigger. But such tactics aren't necessary to create friction over Third World policies. Mr. Dukakis, the Democratic governor of Massachusetts, asserts in an interview that the policies of Mr. Bush and the Reagan administration in Central America are an &quot;absolute failure&quot; and &quot;illegal.&quot; Mr. Bush, the Republican vice president, retorts in a separate interview: &quot;I'm one who thinks we have to continue to lead vigorously and not turn over the Persian Gulf to the U.N. or Central America to the U.N. or some multilateral agency of some sort.&quot;    To a large extent, the two candidates look at Third World problems and see different threats. Mr. Bush is more of a traditional &quot;cold warrior,&quot; who fears above all that the Soviet Union will capitalize on regional unrest to claim new beachheads. Mr. Dukakis, who was deeply influenced by time he spent as a young man living in Peru, more often sees threats arising from economic and social problems that he says both threaten Third World stability and undermine U.S. interests abroad.    Mr. Bush &quot;has a broader definition of what constitutes a Communist threat,&quot; says Richard Millett, a political-science professor at Southern Illinois University. The vice president's views aren't as ideologically fervent as those of President Reagan, who set out to roll back Communist advances around the world, but aides say Mr. Bush would pursue a classic strategy of Soviet containment in the Third World.    Because of his belief that the U.S. needs to directly guard against Soviet expansion, and a cynicism about the U.N. born in his tenure as ambassador there in the early 1970s, Mr. Bush doubts the U.S. can rely much on international organizations.    Mr. Dukakis, by contrast, &quot;doesn't see the roots of every international conflict coming from the Soviet Union,&quot; says Joseph Nye, a Harvard international-affairs specialist who advises the Dukakis campaign. He is far less inclined to believe that U.S.-armed guerrilla armies or U.S.made solutions can foster the stable environment and economic growth central to U.S. interests in the Third World.    Mr. Dukakis peppers his foreign-policy speeches with a declaration that he is &quot;an internationalist.&quot; He talks often about the need to bolster the role of the Organization of American States, or OAS, in hemispheric affairs, and argues the U.S. should have organized an international naval force to protect tankers in the Persian Gulf rather than go it alone.    Some analysts contend that Mr. Dukakis's faith in international organizations is unrealistic. Robert Leiken, a visiting scholar at Harvard's Center for International Affairs, says that multinational approaches in Latin America won't produce results favorable to the U.S., in part because many Latin leaders consistently take anti-Washington positions for domestic political reasons. Another skeptical analyst asserts that the last time the OAS acted forcefully and unanimously was when it agreed in 1940 to bar Nazi Germany from colonizing states in this hemisphere.    But Mr. Bush's reliance on unilateralism has its flaws too, as illustrated by the Reagan administration's embarrassing failure to oust Panama's Manuel Noriega by using U.S. sanctions and pressure. And Mr. Millett argues that Mr. Dukakis's outlook enables him to recognize better the importance of such resource-rich nations as Brazil and Mexico.    Of course, there are some inconsistencies in the Bush and Dukakis positions. Despite Mr. Bush's distrust of multilateral solutions, for instance, he and the Reagan administration have looked to U.N. negotiators to work out a cease-fire in the IranIraq war. And while Mr. Dukakis generally doesn't favor military solutions, he acknowledges that U.S. military aid to Afghan guerrillas helped prompt Soviet troops to withdraw from Afghanistan.    Still, the divergence of the two candidates' views becomes clear in examining their proposals for dealing with the strifetorn regions of Central America and Southern Africa. In Central America, Mr. Bush seems predominantly concerned about a Soviet threat, and he worries about a peace deal in Nicaragua's civil war &quot;that merely stops the shooting and entrenches a Soviet beachhead.&quot;    So he pledges to continue lobbying for U.S. aid for the Contra rebels fighting Nicaragua's Marxist Sandinista government. Privately, aides say Mr. Bush recognizes that Congress probably won't give the Contras significant new backing, so he would work at containing the Sandinistas by bucking up neighboring countries with economic and military aid.    The vice president voices skepticism about regional peace efforts launched by Latin American leaders.&quot;I disagree with what I think Dukakis is saying, that if we just leave them alone, don't do anything about the Contras, these people (in the region) will solve it,&quot; Mr. Bush says in the interview. &quot;There's no evidence to support it, and there's no evidence to think that the Sandinistas will comply.&quot;    Mr. Dukakis replies that years of U.S. aid to Nicaragua's Contras have failed to produce changes there. &quot;I don't think there's a democratically elected chief of state in Central and Latin America who supports our policy,&quot; he says.    So he proposes ending aid to the Contras and instead working &quot;with our democratic neighbors and allies to create an environment for human rights and democracy in Central America and throughout the hemisphere.&quot; Regional pressure will be more effective than U.S. pressure in bringing about changes in Nicaragua, he argues. And because of the Reagan administration's obsession with Nicaragua, he adds, it has failed to notice that the fragile, pro-U.S. government of nearby El Salvador is &quot;on the verge of collapse.&quot;    In Southern Africa, Mr. Dukakis proposes a similar policy overhaul. He endorses a bill in Congress that would impose a trade embargo on South Africa and force U.S. companies to give up operations there, and pledges to push allies to follow suit. He argues that the U.S. has been sending &quot;mixed signals&quot; about whether it is serious about ending apartheid.    In Angola, Mr. Dukakis says he would recognize the Cuban-backed leftist government and end U.S. aid to rebels from the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), which is trying to overthrow it. He argues that U.S. aid to the rebels has produced an &quot;absurd&quot; situation in which Cuban troops stationed in Angola are guarding the facilities of U.S. oil companies from attack by U.S.-armed UNITA forces. He maintains that even if aid to the rebels is cut off, Cuba will follow through on general promises to pull its troops out of Angola because it is in the Cuban &quot;national interest&quot; to stop wasting money on forces in Angola.    For his part, Mr. Bush argues strongly that cutting off aid to UNITA or recognizing the Angolan government will disrupt complex southern Africa peace negotiations launched by the Reagan administration. In those talks, South Africa has agreed to withdraw troops it keeps in Angola and to grant independence to neighboring Namibia if Cuba agrees to pull all of its troops out of Angola.    So Mr. Bush would continue aid to the UNITA rebels, led by Jonas Savimbi, until it is clear Cuban troops are leaving Angola and a process of &quot;reconciliation&quot; between the Angolan government and UNITA begins.    Mr. Bush opposes more economic sanctions against South Africa, contending that so far they have mostly hurt blacks and would just prompt the entrenched apartheid regime to further dig in its heels if the measures are expanded. So Mr. Bush -- echoing the strategy Mr. Dukakis favors in other spots -- calls for diplomatic pressure and negotiations for change.    ---                  In Their Own Words:         Bush and Dukakis On Third World Policy              On aid to Nicaragua's Contras   Bush: &quot;I will support the Nicaraguan freedom fighters who are battling to bring democracy to their country.&quot;   Dukakis: &quot;What we are doing in Central America today is a violation of U.S., as well as international, law. U.S. aid to the Contras must end.&quot;            On sanctions against South Africa   Bush: &quot;Under present circumstances, I will not recommend further sanctions.&quot;   Dukakis: &quot;I want this country to lead international sanctions against South Africa.&quot;               On multinational organizations   Bush: &quot;A president can't subordinate his decision making to a multilateral body, he can't sacrifice one ounce of our sovereignty to any organization.&quot;   Dukakis: &quot;Regional peace and security are not solely a U.S. concern, and they are not solely a U.S. responsibility.&quot;      On aid to Jonas Savimbi's Angolan rebels   Bush: &quot;I will support the Angolan freedom fighters who are forcing the Cuban mercenary troops out of their country.&quot;   Dukakis: &quot;I think our support of Savimbi and UNITA is absolutely bizarre.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
