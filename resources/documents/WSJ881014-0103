Democrats expect to hold or pad their Senate margin.    Republicans aren't within 10 points of any Democratic incumbent, but Democratic challengers Kerrey in Nebraska and Bryan in Nevada have solid leads over GOP senators. Both parties see upset possibilities: Democrats say Hubert Humphrey III is gaining in Minnesota, while Republicans think they have a shot at 80-year-old Burdick in North Dakota. &quot;A lot of people aren't going to make up their minds until they get in the booth,&quot; says analyst Charles Cook.    Open seats seem to be splitting. Virginia is a shoo-in for Democrats, who also believe they are within striking distance in Florida; Republicans think Mississippi looks good. Both sides see Washington state as a tossup. Overall, Cook sees Democrats adding one or two seats to their current 54-46 majority.    Dukakis slippage could hurt some Democrats, but Bush isn't campaigning on the broad themes that could power a 1980-style partywide sweep.    CONGRESS CROWS about its accomplishments as lawmakers head home.    Leaders of both parties hail the 100th Congress. Senate GOP whip Simpson says lawmakers compiled a &quot;stunning legislative record.&quot; But Democrats have more reason to be pleased. Many of the session's major accomplishments advanced their agenda: the big trade bill, plant-closing notification, civil-rights expansion, fair housing.    Even Reagan administration initiatives smacked of Democratic programs: welfare overhaul and catastrophic-illness insurance. But the 100th also leaves disappointments: failure to agree on a new minimum-wage bill, no parental-leave bill, unsuccessful efforts at a compromise on clean-air legislation.    SIGNS OF SLOWDOWN bring temporary peace to the Federal Reserve.    Economic indicators and falling oil prices strengthen the case for interest-rate stability at least until after the election. Calm financial markets reduce pressure on the Fed to demonstrate its inflation-fighting resolve. Still, tension persists between the district bank presidents, proteges of Volcker, and Reagan-appointed governors.    Some district presidents aren't convinced the economy has slowed enough for the central bank to relax -- while some governors fear it may already have tightened too much. Reagan's successor will have to rely on Chairman Greenspan to forge a consensus. No Fed vacancies are expected until 1990; Greenspan's term extends to 1991.    Citicorp Chairman John Reed predicts Greenspan will &quot;do a deal&quot; with the new president: lower rates in return for big deficit reduction.   PRIVATE MONEY flows freely to both presidential candidates. The Dukakis camp's $50 million goal, initially dismissed as unrealistic, now seems clearly within reach. A Quayle event in Indianapolis raised $500,000 this week for the GOP; Bush people hope to raise $1.5 million next week for a series of &quot;Vote Republican&quot; commercials.    NO WELCOME MAT: Eager to win Jewish support for Bush, administration officials signal their intention to refuse Arafat a visa that would enable him to address the United Nations. Ironically, three major Jewish groups meeting privately last month decided not to mount a fight against the visit.    SEC MARKET-WATCHERS worry that some U.S. brokerage firms will be vulnerable to the unreported liabilities of their overseas arms. They also fret about the damage a firm's collapse could do to an uncertain stock market. The agency steps up its efforts to gain more international cooperation in market and corporate-finance regulation.    MONKEY BUSINESS: North Carolina Democratic gubernatorial candidate Robert Jordan draws blood with a new TV ad using chimpanzees to depict the budget advisers of GOP incumbent Gov. James Martin. The chimps work an adding machine, turn cartwheels and roller-skate on the desk. Unamused, a Martin spokesman calls the ad offensive and predicts it will cost Jordan the election.    AIRPORT ANXIETIES mount because of O'Hare's safety problems.    Some safety experts are encouraged by the FAA's cutbacks in Chicago as a change from its traditional philosophy of trying to accommodate ever-growing air traffic. But they say the errors in Chicago reveal underlying weaknesses nationwide in the FAA's training and management of air-traffic controllers.    FAA officials study other problem airports, too. The next target: San Diego. Their reviews may lead to changes in the ways controllers are deployed. Currently, congressional investigators say, students who earn poor grades at controller school sometimes end up working at the busiest facilities; many of them fail on the job.    Meanwhile, investigators say a shortage of qualified repairmen for new traffic-control equipment may be a &quot;sleeping giant&quot; of a problem.    MINOR MEMOS: Metropolitan Life Insurance statisticians figure that presidents, on the average, don't live as long as other men of their generation -- but vice presidents generally live longer. . . . We Have Seen the Futures: The Chicago Mercantile Exchange offers to help the Soviet Union explore making the ruble convertible. . . . When Reagan spoke at Upper Darby High School in Pennsylvania, his press staff was housed in -- of all things -- the school library's fiction room. </TEXT></DOC>
