Texaco and Saudi Arabia have completed a well-defined letter of intent and are in the last stages of executing a final agreement, Texaco officials say.    A six-member board of directors has been set up to run the new company, Texaco Chief Executive Officer James W. Kinnear told an oil industry conference yesterday. He identified the directors as: Glenn Tilton, president of Texaco Refining andamp; Marketing Inc.; Robert Ulrich, Texaco's deputy treasurer; James Shamas, president of Texaco Trading andamp; Transportation Inc.; Hamad A. Juraifani, chairman and chief executive of Saudi Refining Inc.; Thomas Q. Schultz, president of Saudi Refining; and Seth Shar, vice president of Aramco Services Co.    Saudi nationals haven't been included in the management team overseeing operations. But Mr. Kinnear said the position of assistant to Chief Executive Donald Schmude is being held open for a Saudi.    Mr. Kinnear said the company, which hasn't been named, will have its own trading arm which will buy crude oil from Saudi Arabia for its three refineries in &quot;arms length&quot; transactions. Although Saudi Arabia has in the past given preferential treatment to Aramco partners -- Texaco, Mobil Corp., Exxon Corp. and Chevron Corp. -- Mr. Kinnear ruled out any suggestions that the joint-venture company would receive discounts on the crude it purchases from the Saudis.    Mr. Schultz has previously said the joint-venture company would designate a &quot;marker&quot; crude and adjust the price it pays Saudi Arabia in line with fluctuations in the price of that crude.    Mr. Kinnear said the joint-venture refineries at Port Arthur, Texas, Delaware City, Del., and Convent, La., wouldn't run exclusively on Saudi oil. They import about 70% of the oil they process, much of that from Saudi Arabia. That arrangement would continue, he said. Some of the remaining oil would be acquired through spot, or noncontract, purchases.    In an annoucement last June, Saudi Arabia said it had agreed to participate in the joint venture which has an estimated value of $2 billion for Texaco. Once completed, the transaction will make the kingdom one of the largest gasoline retailers in the Eastern U.S. with access to more than 11,450 gasoline stations.    Although Mr. Kinnear said it was unlikely Texaco would strike any other joint-venture arrangements in the U.S., he wouldn't rule out other such arrangements involving Texaco operations outside the U.S. &quot;But we're not pushing anything else right now,&quot; he said. &quot;We have to digest this one.&quot;    Speaking separately about the sale of Texaco's 78% stake in Texaco Canada Ltd., Mr. Kinnear said he expected interested buyers to declare their intent within several weeks. </TEXT></DOC>
