Col. Oliver North exchanged backdated letters to give the appearance that Col. North was paying for an expensive home-security system.    The consultant, Glenn Robinette, a former Central Intelligence Agency officer, testified that the $16,000 bill for the security system actually was paid by retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, who along with Col. North supervised the secret weapons sales to Iran and the arms airlift to the Nicaraguan rebels known as Contras.    Mr. Robinette, 66 years old, said that last December he sent Col. North two phony bills and that the Marine officer sent him two fabricated responses after he was fired as a White House aide and a criminal investigation into the Iran-Contra affair had begun. Committee members noted that it is a crime for a government employee to receive anything of value for services other than salary.    Separately, new questions arose yesterday about whether Gen. Secord reaped additional money from the profits of the Iran arms sales. A former Pentagon official testified that he resigned last Friday as a trustee of a fund set up to pay Gen. Secord's legal expenses, after the official was unable to learn who had contributed $500,000 to the fund.    Noel Koch, formerly the Pentagon's top counter-terrorism official, said that beginning six or seven weeks ago three anonymous deposits from Credit Suisse of Switzerland were contributed to the Richard Secord Legal Assistance Fund. Credit Suisse was one of the principal banks used by the Iran-Contra arms network directed by Gen. Secord. Mr. Koch testified that Gen. Secord told him he didn't know who had made the contributions, and congressional investigators said they haven't established who made the contributions either.    Yesterday's testimony came as the committees resumed public hearings after a two-week recess. In closed-door meetings yesteday, panel members continued discussions regarding Col. North's testimony next month but remained undecided over the exact conditions for his questioning.    Given the delay, a subpoena to be returned today was postponed for another 24 hours. This subpoena for documents, including Col. North's personal notebooks of his covert activities, remains a legal tripwire of sorts that could force contempt-of-Congress proceedings if a resolution isn't reached with Col. North's attorney.    Mr. Robinette's testimony damaged both Gen. Secord and Col. North. It contradicted public statements by Gen. Secord, who repeatedly has denied -- as recently as last week -- that he had any involvement in the security system at Col. North's Great Falls, Va., home. And Mr. Robinette said he thought that Col. North wanted him to help cover up that the Marine officer hadn't paid for the security system.    Referring to the security-system incident, Rep. Henry Hyde (R., Ill.), a North supporter, told reporters: &quot;I think it's very harmful, very damaging&quot; to Col. North's image. &quot;I think it's sad, it's sleazy.&quot;    Mr. Robinette, who became a private consultant in 1971, testified he was initially hired by Gen. Secord to do investigative work last year and was paid $18,000 in checks and a similar amount in cash. Gen. Secord has acknowledged hiring him for such work.    Mr. Robinette, who testified under a limited grant of immunity, said he hired two contractors to install the security system, beginning in May 1986, after Gen. Secord asked him to handle the matter because of threats against Col. North and his family. Mr. Robinette said he never asked the Marine officer for payment and Col. North never offered any. He said Col. North met with him and approved the design for the system, which included an electronic gate outside the house, external lighting, heat and smoke detectors, and door and window alarms.    The security consultant said he received a $7,000 cash payment from Gen. Secord in May 1986. In August, after the job was completed, he said he asked Gen. Secord for an additional $9,000 and received a check for that amount from CSF Investments Ltd. CSF Investments, a Bermuda company, has been closely linked to Gen. Secord's financial enterprise by committee investigators.    The committee released documents showing that CSF Investments was reimbursed $9,000 by Udall Research Corp., a Panama company used by Gen. Secord and his associates as a holding company for properties used in the Contra airlift. Mr. Robinette said the security system cost $13,875, and that he pocketed another $2,125 as consulting fees.    He said that last December, after Col. North was fired, the marine officer phoned him and asked for a bill. He said he prepared and sent Col. North two letters, dated in July and September, 1986, requesting an $8,000 payment. Col. North, he said, responded with two backdated letters indicating that he would pay for the installation.    He said he sent the bills to give Col. North &quot;a cover story.&quot; Mr. Robinette agreed when a Senate committee lawyer, Paul Barbadoro, characterized his letters as &quot;phony bills&quot; and Col. North's letters as &quot;cooked-up responses.&quot;    Mr. Koch, the Pentagon official, testified that he didn't believe the mysterious $500,000 contribution to the Secord defense fund was &quot;dirty&quot; money. The former official said Gen. Secord told him he didn't think the money came from his business partner, Albert Hakim, because Mr. Hakim's bank accounts in Switzerland have been frozen. But congressional sources said the committees are attempting to learn whether the money may have come from Cie. des Services Fiduciares, a Swiss financial-management firm that has had close ties to Mr. Hakim.    Mr. Koch also offered further insight into why President Reagan pressed ahead with the policy of selling arms to Iran over the strenuous objections of senior administration officials. He said that in November 1985, Col. North told him that the president was pressing him for the release of Americans held hostage in Lebanon by Christmas.    Mr. Koch said that despite the president's interest, bureaucratic squabbling and indecision have crippled the administration's efforts to fight terrorism. He said the hostage crisis could be ended quickly if the U.S. were &quot;a little more creative.&quot; For example, he said, the U.S. could seize a prominent Lebanese Shiite cleric who is the spiritual mentor of the terrorist group Hezbollah, remove &quot;something not life-threatening, like a finger,&quot; and send it to another Shiite terrorist leader. </TEXT></DOC>
