Gen. EhudBarak, deputy chief of staff.   Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization,publicly renounced terrorism in December and recognized Israel'sright to exist. The United States then opened a dialogue with thePLO, over Israeli objections.   Groups within the PLO apparently want ``to show theirconstituencies that, in spite of Arafat's declaration, the action isstill going on,'' the general said. ``We would be happy if the restof the world would also realize that.'' He described terrorism as``the way a terrorist group attacks civilians, settlements, womenand children and even the normal activities of the Israel DefenseForces in the area it controls.''   Barak was addressing a delegation from an international Jewishsolidarity conference when reports of the gun battle began to arrive.   Army spokesmen said the South Lebanon Army, which helps patrolIsrael's self-proclaimed zone just north of the border, saw aguerrilla squad just over a mile west of Houla, a Lebanese villageabout the same distance from the frontier, and gave chase.   The military command said it did not know what group theguerrillas represented. Israeli sources said they probably belongedto the Shiite Moslem militia Hezbollah, or Party of God, which isloyal to Iran and not affiliated with the PLO.   According to the sources, the dead guerrillas carried a copy ofthe Koran, a Moslem prayer book, Kalashnikov assault rifles, arocket-propelled grenade launcher and maps of the area.   It was the third confrontation in 10 days in the ``securityzone,'' which varies in depth from six to 10 miles. Israeli forceskilled five members of a radical PLO group in encountered March 12and 13.</TEXT></DOC>
