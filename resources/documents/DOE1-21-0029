However, due toregulatory pressures, as well as increasing burial costs, significantchanges have taken place in the way these systems are operated. In additionto the cost associated with the primary treatment itself, the costs tomanage the secondary wastes generated by the process have caused manyplants to re-evaluate their waste management programs in general. Chem-Nuclearrealized that these changes were coming and set out to minimize theirimpact on the utilities. A set of criteria was established to evaluatealternative methods and improvements to existing methods of liquid wastetreatment. This paper examines in detail the most common methods of primaryand secondary waste treatment and those changes that have come about.Chem-Nuclear method of evaluating alternatives is discussed, and fourmajor developments reviewed.</TEXT></DOC>
