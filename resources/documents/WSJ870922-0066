Under the agreement, approved yesterday by both banks' directors, the two banks would operate as wholly owned subsidiaries of a new Holyoke-based holding company, Heritage Bancorp Inc. Community shareholders would receive $15 in cash and $5 in convertible debentures for each of their shares. Heritage shareholders would receive one share of holding company stock for each Heritage-NIS share. The agreement is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals.    In a measure designed to forestall any competing offers for Community, Community has issued a warrant permitting Heritage to purchase as much as 24.9% of its stock under certain circumstances. Community has about 4.5 million shares outstanding. As of June 30, Heritage had 6.9 million shares outstanding.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Community jumped $2.50 to close at $15.75 a share, while Heritage closed at $12.25 a share, down 25 cents.    Heritage-NIS has assets of about $859 million and 14 offices in Hampshire and Franklin counties in western Massachusetts. It also has subsidiaries engaged in real estate lending, development and appraisal. Community, with assets of about $531 million, has 17 offices, most of them in Hampden County, Massachusetts, south of Hampshire County. It also has a real estate brokerage subsidiary.    Following the transaction, Richard B. Covell, president of Heritage-NIS, would become chairman of the board and chief executive officer of the new holding company. Roy A. Scott, Community's president, would become the holding company's president and chief operating officer. The new board would consist of seven directors named by Heritage-NIS and five named by Community. </TEXT></DOC>
