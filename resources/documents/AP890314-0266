DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal judge today asked for clarification ofan unprecedented settlement prosecutors say will wrest the Teamstersunion from the Mafia.   Under the settlement, which is subject to approval by U.S.District Judte David N. Edelstein, the nation's biggest union willinstitute the secret ballot, and three court-appointed watchdogswill oversee the Teamsters for three years.   However, Edelstein recessed a morning hearing until theafternoon, citing ``apparent ambiguities on matters of seriousimportance.'' The judge asked both sides to ``provide this courtwith the clarification essential.''   The accord was announced Monday hours before the start of a trialon a racketeering lawsuit to oust the union's allegedlymob-influenced executive board.   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh detailed the terms of theagreement in Washington, saying it will give the government ``thetools to clean up this union and return control to rank and fileunion members.''   Rudolph W. Giuliani, who filed the lawsuit in June when he wasU.S. attorney, said the agreement ``achieved all the majorobjectives that the government wanted.   ``It should be considered a breakthrough,'' he said.   Beginning in 1991, the union's highest leaders for the first timein Teamsters' history will be elected directly by the members insecret ballot votes.   Currently, delegates to the national convention pick theexecutive board members by roll-call vote.   Also under the settlement, the judge will appoint three overseersfor three years, with the joint approval of both sides. One wouldinvestigate and prosecute alleged union corruption, one wouldadminister disciplinary action and the third would oversee elections.   ``All Teamsters international union officials will be directlyelected by the membership in secret ballot. That's never happenedbefore,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Randy Mastro, the leadprosecutor.   In exchange, prosecutors dropped their bid to seize control ofthe 1.6 million member union through a court-appointed trustee. Thesettlement also allows all 11 Teamsters who remained as defendants,including international President William J. McCarthy, plus threeother officials who settled last week to remain on the board.   The pact between the current union leadership and the JusticeDepartment gives neither side complete control, although both sidestried to put the best face on the compromise agreement.   ``The members are assured there is a mechanism in place to removethose persons alleged to be conducting improper activities,'' saidJames T. Grady, Teamsters' general counsel. ``The goals of a cleanand democratic union are consistent with the goals of the currentleadership.''   Thornburgh said the settlement ``culminates 30 years of efforts''by the Justice Department ``to remove the influence of organizedcrime within the Teamsters union.''   Using federal racketeering laws, prosecutors sought acourt-appointed trustee or committee to run the Teamsters and imposea series of reforms. It was the first time the government had triedto seize control of an entire union.   Thornburgh said the settlement contained ``roughly the same kindof remedy that was sought'' in the lawsuit.   But Grady noted that none of the union's ruling executive boardmembers would have to resign and there will be no all-powerfultrustee running the union on a day-to-day basis.   The lawsuit claimed the Teamsters' leadership had been dominatedby organized crime, which ``deprived union members of their rightsthrough a pattern of racketeering'' and a ``campaign of fear'' thatincluded 20 murders, dozens of bombings, beatings, bribes, extortionand theft.   Most of the 26 reputed mobsters originally named defendants weredismissed when they either agreed, or were ordered, to drop anyinvolvement with the Teamsters. Five, including convicted Colombocrime family boss Carmine ``Junior'' Persico, have been severed fromthe case and will be tried later.   When he filed the lawsuit, Giuliani said the action was anattempt to break the ``devil's pact'' the Teamsters' leadership hadmade with the Mafia.   The government's move was roundly criticized by congressmen andlabor leaders. The AFL-CIO, which allowed the Teamsters to rejoin in1987 after a 30-year rift over corruption, called the lawsuit ```aclear abuse of the government's prosecutorial power.''   Prosecutors noted in court papers that four Teamsters presidentssince the 1950s have faced federal felony charges and three wereconvicted: David Beck for embezzlement, James ``Jimmy'' Hoffa forobstructing justice and mail fraud, and Roy Williams for trying tobribe a U.S. senator.   The fourth, Jackie Presser, the union's president at the time thelawsuit was brought, died while under indictment on embezzlementcharges.</TEXT></DOC>
