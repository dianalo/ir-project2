Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Rep. Tom Ridge, R-Pa., onWednesday called for the establishment of a ``working U.S.presence'' in Vietnam. They said little progress has been made onnumerous issues which remain as the ``legacy'' of the Vietnam War,despite numerous visits to Vietnam by congressional andadministration delegations.   The administration, however, said it opposed the lawmakers' callfor the creation of ``interest sections,'' which are typicallyestablished between nations that don't recognize each other butacknowledge mutual concerns.   The United States and Cuba, for example, have interest sectionpersonnel stationed in third-party embassies in each others'nations.   ``We continue to believe that political and economic isolationis the most effective way of pressing Vietnam to end its occupationof Cambodia,'' the State Department said in a statement releasedWednedsay.   ``We are prepared to discuss normalization with Vietnam,therefore, only in the context of an acceptable settlement inCambodia which includes the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops,'' itsaid. Vietnam's military occupation of Cambodia is in its ninthyear.   McCain and Ridge are both Vietnam veterans and McCain is aformer prisoner of war. They issued their call for greaterdiplomatic contact with Vietnam on the 15th anniversary of McCain'srelease after five years of captivity.   McCain said establishment of interest sections ``falls far shortof diplomatic recognition, and certainly implies no approval of anation's policies.''   He said that if no progress is made on issues such as Americansstill listed as missing from the Southeast Asian conflict, then``the option of further normalization'' could always be set aside.   McCain said several members of the administration had indicatedprivately that they supported better communication between thenations, but that he expected that the administration's``official'' position on Vietnam would remain the same.   McCain and Ridge said greater contact also is needed toadminister a two-year program to bring 8,000 to 12,000 children ofAmerican soldiers to the United States.   ``There is a tremendous logistical problem and barrier toprogress, just by the fact that all of our technical people musttravel in and out of Bangkok every time there is to becommunication,'' Ridge said.</TEXT></DOC>
