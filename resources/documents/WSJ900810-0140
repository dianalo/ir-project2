Surveying nearly 400 companies in the U.S., Canada andEurope, the Conference Board found that more than 80% of therespondents said that requesting more information fromprospective workers helps avoid the need for more-intrusivemeasures, such as electronic surveillance, to ensureworkplace security.</LP><TEXT>   But information-gathering options are being reviewedcarefully by the courts and elected representatives.Polygraphs used to be &quot;one way to get information. They areno longer allowed in all but a few situations,&quot; says RonaldE. Berenbeim, author of the study at the nonprofit researchgroup. Also, &quot;a certain amount of opposition and concern&quot;about psychological testing is developing, the analyst says.   Among potentially sensitive subjects, a substantialproportion of companies said they needed more informationthan they did five years ago about employee health, but notabout age and marital status, criminal record, personalfinancial status, or outside activities.   Two-thirds of the U.S. participants said a lack of healthdata had impeded their efforts to control health-care costs.More than a third of U.S. companies did say they needed moredata about criminal records, but such need isn't shared bythe Canadian and European participants, the survey says.   Nearly half the participants limit an immediatesupervisor's access to data about subordinates; almost allthe companies restrict managers from reviewing informationabout employees who don't work for them, the report says.   And three-quarters of the respondents said they wouldn'tdivulge any data other than salary to prospective employers.   The report showed a sharp divergence of opinion regardingpsychological tests, with 70% of non-U.S. companies callingthem useful and just 47% of the U.S. companies agreeing.Those U.S. companies that disagreed called such testsinappropriate for their work forces and said they could causelitigation.   More than two-thirds of the participants said searches andsurveillance are ineffective, hurting morale, going againstcompany philosophy, and -- again -- potentially dragging acompany into a lawsuit.   Nonetheless, &quot;such practices are fairly widespread,particularly&quot; in the U.S., the survey says. Some 15% of thecompanies monitor use of phones and computers to determinewhether they are being used for nonbusiness purposes. And amajority of participants in all three regions will search aworker's locker, desk or office.   As for off-duty conduct, &quot;Company intrusions orrestrictions on intimate employee behavior are rare,&quot; thereport says. And when an employee doesn't disclose hisrelationship to his or her company, bans on outside politicalactivity also are &quot;infrequent,&quot; the survey found.   The survey recommends certain policies and practicesregarding employee privacy. These include establishingwritten criteria for the personnel data the company collects;giving employees the right to see their files and tochallenge inaccuracies; and limiting the access thatemployees' immediate managers and other supervisors have tothose files.   Among other things, the report also suggests thatcompanies should give workers' copies of written requests forinformation and, except where law enforcers demandinformation via subpoena or other methods, should release thedata only if the worker consents.</TEXT></DOC>
