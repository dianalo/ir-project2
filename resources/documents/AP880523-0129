Whitehead-Gould, whose effort to void her surrogating contractwas upheld by the New Jersey Supreme Court, called on state legalsystems and the media to join in a campaign against surrogacy.   She was accompanied by other members of the National CoalitionAgainst Surrogacy, a group comprising lawyers, doctors and 17surrogate mothers.   Coalition leader Jeremy Rifkin said the group on Monday sentpetitions to attorneys general in 12 states where surrogate brokersare known to operate. Such brokers charge a fee to set upagreements linking infertile couples with women willing to bearthem a child.   ``These are the middlemen who have engaged in the unconscionableact of hiring women as breeders,'' Rifkin said.   Rifkin said the coalition will mount a four-pronged attackagainst the brokers. Along with legal pressure, the group willattempt to marshal public opinion in states where brokers dobusiness, and try to force the issue of surrogate parenting intolocal and national politics.   Finally, Rifkin said, the coalition will target newspapers thatrun advertising on behalf of surrogate brokers or agencies.   ``We're going to put all the brokers on notice,'' said Rifkin,an environmental activist who also has been critical of the newscience of genetic engineering.   States where brokers operate, according to the coalition, areCalifornia, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland,Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania andWashington state.   Gena Corea, the coalition's co-chairwoman, accused brokers ofpreying on lower-income women who need the money but may notunderstand the implication of signing away unborn children.   The surrogates are often abused physically and psychologicallyby brokers, Corea claimed.   ``We want this surrogacy industry gone. Let it stop feeding offour flesh,'' Corea said.   Surrogate mother Lauri Yates of Michigan pleaded, ``Please,before they wreck any more lives, before they cause any more pain,please close them down.'' Yates said she gave up her twins to aninfertile couple because she and her husband couldn't afford toraise them.   Whitehead-Gould became the nation's best-known surrogate aftershe refused to surrender her infant daughter to its biologicalfather and his wife. A state court upheld the father's $10,000contract.   But the contract was voided in February by the New JerseySupreme Court, even though the court allowed the girl's father,William Stern, to maintain custody of the child. Last monthWhitehead-Gould struck an agreement with Stern giving herliberalized visitation rights.   The case is the subject of the made-for-television film, ``BabyM,'' which aired Sunday and Monday on ABC. Whitehead-Gouldcriticized the film as inaccurate.</TEXT></DOC>
