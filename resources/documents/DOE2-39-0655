A special cold trap system wasdeveloped for the measurement of release rates and also the integralamount of released water. In order to evaluate these measuring data someadditional instrumentation as for example seismoacoustic monitoring,and gas pressure measurements were applied. The layout of in situ experimentsat the Asse Salt Mine, the technical and physical principles of the measuringmethods and some typical results are discussed and presented. 11 refs.;8 figs. refs.</TEXT></DOC>
