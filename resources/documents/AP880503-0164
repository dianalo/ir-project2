Roland R. Vautour, undersecretary for small community and ruraldevelopment, said cooperative federal efforts now under way arehelping rural communities regain economic stability.   Vautour said rural communities suffered from inflation in thelate 1970s, global economic recession and farmland value losses inthe early 1980s and from a rise in foreign agricultural production.   ``In the past, rural economic development has been dependent onfarm policy and income,'' he said. ``We now recognize that thefuture growth and stability of the rural economy is dependent ondiversification at the local level, both in farm production and inthe other businss segments of community and state economies.''   The 19-page report itself added: ``The current federalinitiative (on rural development) stresses the need for ruralAmerica to look within for development possibilities. America'ssmall and rural communities need to realize there are simply notenough branch plants of major manufacturers to go around. RuralAmerica must draw upon its own strengths and use them to promotedevelopment.''   Field hearings are being planned so that Vautour can ``listen tothe needs and concerns of the local officials, residents, students,teachers, business people and senior citizens,'' the report said.   The report outlined rural economic development programsavailable at USDA and at other federal agencies.</TEXT></DOC>
