Jackson a major role in the fall campaign but makes no commitment of a place in a future Democratic administration.    Gov. Dukakis warmly praised his unsuccessful rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, and though stopping short of an outright endorsement, Mr. Jackson didn't signal any desire to challenge the governor's choice of Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen for the second spot on the ticket. Mr. Dukakis said he would begin to bring Jackson campaign personnel onto his own staff for the fall, and negotiations were stepped up to resolve remaining platform fights as the national convention opened last night.    The two rivals, joined by Sen. Bentsen, appeared at a joint news conference following nearly three hours of talks in Mr. Dukakis's Atlanta hotel suite. Whatever hurt feelings remain, both sides appeared determined to put an end to the days of wrangling that had threatened to overtake the convention and permanently scar their relationship going into the fall campaign.    &quot;We made the judgment to not let our ships pass in the night, to not let our ships crash,&quot; said the Rev. Jackson, &quot;but to combine our strength to get the people who support us safely to shore away from the vicious storm of seven years of Reagan economics.&quot;    Neither man could afford a full-fledged confrontation at this stage, but as the certain nominee, Mr. Dukakis had more to lose. His words of respect and friendship for Mr. Jackson sought to heal prior slights, but the meeting was orchestrated to portray the governor as a figure in control and strong enough yesterday to blunt recent demands by Mr. Jackson for a specific role in any transition after the November election. Mr. Dukakis dismissed as &quot;premature&quot; discussion of Mr. Jackson's role in a future government, and in platform negotiations, the Dukakis camp hasn't shown any shift on questions of taxes and defense spending.    &quot;Our common commitment to economic opportunity and equality of opportunity to all Americans is very strong,&quot; said the Massachusetts governor, seeking to bring Sen. Bentsen, a Texas conservative, under the same umbrella as the more populist Mr. Jackson. &quot;We're concerned about the campaign . . . . Once we've won the victory, we can build the kind of bond, the kind of unity, the kind of trust that we believe we can. The rest will take care of itself.&quot;    Jackson supporters appeared to be satisfied -- but still wary of the results. The minister praised both the governor and Sen. Bentsen at a subsequent meeting with delegates and conveyed the message that he had struck a good deal. &quot;Day by day, hour by hour, we'll see what happens,&quot; said James Butler, a New York labor leader and Jackson delegate. &quot;The Dukakis team created a major infection, and I think we came up with a major antidote to clear up the infection.&quot;    At a populist caucus, Texas Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower welcomed the opportunity to get back to running against Republicans -- &quot;the most fun you can have with your clothes on,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm satisfied that Jesse's satisfied,&quot; said Mr. Hightower, a Jackson supporter. &quot;The door's been opened and y'all come in.&quot;    That invitation carries with it the promise of a greater role for the Jackson staff in the permanent party structure as well as the Dukakis campaign. The executive committee of the Democratic National Committee will be expanded to include Jackson supporters, and the Dukakis campaign will pay for traveling staff to assist Mr. Jackson in future campaign appearances.&quot;Much of his apparatus will be kept intact,&quot; said Paul Brountas, chairman of the Dukakis campaign.    Though no specific announcements were made as to how the two staffs will be integrated, the Jackson camp clearly expects to have a voice in future strategy as well as gain a foothold in the Dukakis machinery that will continue to have influence after the election.    Mr. Dukakis's openness toward Mr. Jackson is sure to be highlighted by Republicans competing for the votes of conservative Democrats, but on issues there has been little change in the governor's posture. The legislative priorities cited at the news conference were in line with prior commitments, yet platform negotiators held out hope that floor fights tonight could be minimized.    The friction between the two camps grew most immediately out of the circumstances surrounding Mr. Dukakis's selection of Mr. Bentsen last week, but much is owed as well to the very different personalities of the two candidates and their respective campaigns. Mr. Jackson was embittered that Gov. Dukakis failed to notify him ahead of time of his decision. But even before that, Mr. Jackson seemed to have conflicting impulses about how to end his remarkable campaign.    In the behind-the-scenes negotiations, there has been tension between him and some of his most loyal supporters who sought to continue talks with the Dukakis campaign. Eleanor Holmes Norton, his chief platform negotiator, maintained contact with the Dukakis campaign last week even after the official talks had been suspended, and when informed of this, Mr. Jackson reportedly sharply upbraided her in front of others. &quot;He blew up at her . . . . He wasn't nice,&quot; said a person close to the Jackson camp.    &quot;For Jesse Jackson, politics is theater and theater is timing,&quot; said former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt, an early dropout in the Democratic presidential contest. &quot;Jesse is a master of timing, and all this will be resolved at the right time.&quot;    Both Mr. Hightower and California House Speaker Willie Brown, chairman of the Jackson campaign, ironically credited Sen. Bentsen with helping to ease the tensions between the two candidates. Though not present during the first portion of the meeting, the Texan was brought in subsequently, and Mr. Brown said the Southerner helped to break through the seeming cultural barrier separating Messrs. Dukakis and Jackson.    The day of reconciliation was set against the symbolism of last night's opening ceremonies featuring former President Jimmy Carter and two new party stars in the South, Texas state treasurer Ann Richards and Rep. Mike Espy of Mississippi.    A witty, former schoolteacher elected in 1982, Ms. Richards was the first woman to win statewide office in Texas in a half century, and her victory was built upon a coalition of liberal, populist Democrats joined with the more conservative wing under Sen. Bentsen.    Mr. Espy, who in 1986 became the first black congressman from Mississippi since Reconstruction, capitalized in turn on the groundwork laid by Mr. Jackson's first presidential campaign two years before, and his remarks were laced with the same rhetoric as the man denied the vice-presidential nomination by Gov. Dukakis.    &quot;This Republican administration treats us as if we were pieces of a puzzle that can't fit together,&quot; said Ms. Richards, who delivered the keynote address. &quot;Their political theory is divide and conquer.&quot;    &quot;For eight straight years George Bush hasn't displayed the slightest interest in anything we care about,&quot; she said, taking aim at the Democrats' GOP rival in the fall. &quot;Now that he's after a job he can't get appointed to, he's like Columbus discovering America. He's found child care. He's found education. Poor George, he can't help it, he was born with a silver foot in his mouth.&quot;    Playing on themes expected to be heard throughout the campaign, Ms. Richards sought to belittle Mr. Bush's own Southern credentials while turning the defense issue -- still strong in the region -- against the GOP. &quot;I'm delighted to be here,&quot; she joked, &quot;Because after listening to George Bush all these years, I figured you needed to know what a real Texas accent sounds like.&quot; The administration's arms buildup had left &quot;this country a military colossus, but we've let our economic line of defense fall into disrepair.&quot; she said. &quot;You don't have to be from Waco to know that when the Pentagon makes crooks rich and doesn't make America strong . . . that's a bum deal.&quot;    Time and increased party confidence allowed the return of another Southern voice, Jimmy Carter, scarcely heard four years ago. &quot;Camp David is not just a weekend retreat,&quot; said the former president, shifting the debate for a rare moment to foreign policy. &quot;Arabs and Jews still cry out for peace, but without strong and persistent leadership from the president of the United States, their cries will continue to go unanswered.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
