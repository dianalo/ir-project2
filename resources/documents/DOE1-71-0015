Meso-carbon pellets can be obtained by applyinga heat treatment to oil-based or coal-based pitch and its graphitizedones after the heating treatment at 2,500{sup 0} are used as aggregate.This graphitized material is pulverized into a particle size of 50{mu}mor less and bonded with thermosetting resin into a compact. Since eachparticle of this aggregate has a spherical shape, its moldability isgood and an elaborate structure can be obtained thereof with a smallquantity of binder. Furthermore, when a particle size of aggregate exceeds50{mu}m, the density of the obtained compact does not increase and suchcharacteristics as gas impermeability and electric conductivity do notbecome satisfactory.
