Data gathered during the eight-day census, including on Soviets'education level, place of residence, ethnic group and language, willbe used ``to plan the main directions of the country's economic andsocial development,'' the Communist Party daily Pravda said.   The census is the first in the Soviet Union since 1979, when thepopulation was found to number 262.4 million. In January 1988,government statisticians estimated the Soviet population at 284.5million.   In the next eight days, census-takers will call at Soviets'homes, but will also comb railway stations, airports, trains,planes, shops, hotels and hospitals to assure an accurate populationcount, Pravda said.   Foreigners who live in the Soviet Union will also be counted,Pravda said.   One-quarter of the Soviets polled will be asked to answeradditional questions, including where their workplace is located,the time they've resided in their present home, its size and degreeof comfort, and how many children they have given birth to if theyare women, Pravda said.   The census will also show the changing ethnic makeup of theSoviet Union, Pravda said. Western demographers estimate thecountry's Moslem nationalities, because of a higher birthrate, couldbecome a majority in the country by the end of the century.   Pravda said preliminary results of the census are expected inApril, and more definitive data in the fall of 1990.   The newspaper assured Soviets that the answers they givencensus-takers will be kept confidential, and asked them toattentively answer the questions they are asked.</TEXT></DOC>
