NBC's story of the legalization of abortion, airing Monday, isgraced by Emmy-worthy performances down to the smallest supportingrole and a courageous script that takes a stand without talkingdown to the other side.   Holly Hunter (``Broadcast News'') stars as Ellen Russell, apenniless drifter who has left an abusive husband and been forcedto give her daughter to her mother to raise. Unmarried and pregnantagain, she faces the prospect of having to give up another baby foradoption.   Hardly the most sympathetic case imaginable _ ``You have themorals of a cat,'' snipes her mother _ she is nevertheless the onlywoman willing to allow two young female lawyers to use her case asa test of Texas' stringent anti-abortion law.   The character of Ellen is based on Norma McCorvey, thereal-life, then-anonymous ``Jane Roe'' who sued Dallas DistrictAttorney Henry Wade for enforcing the law. Her case led to the 1973U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion. The Supreme Courtrecently heard arguments on a Missouri case, and the justices'ruling this summer could effect the 1973 decision.   Producers used pseudonyms for McCorvey, her relatives andfriends to protect their privacy. Since work on the script beganthree years ago, however, McCorvey has become a public critic ofefforts to overturn the abortion decision.   Other characters' real names are used. Amy Madigan (``Field ofDreams'') is excellent as Sarah Weddington, the neophyte lawyer whosuccessfully argues the case, first before a panel of federaljudges in Texas. They find the anti-abortion law unconstitutionallyvague but refuse to grant an injunction, leaving the law on thebooks until the decision can be appealed and forcing Ellen tocontinue with the pregnancy.   ``You might explain to me how it is you won and I lost,'' says adistraught Ellen when Weddington calls to explain the decision toher.   The movie follows the dual struggles of Russell as she isrefused job after job because she is pregnant, and Weddington, whofinds plenty of support but scant actual help preparing the complexcase for the high court. Her partner, Linda Coffey (AnnabellaPrice), has to virtually drop out because of the demands of otherlegal work.   By the time Weddington argues the case before the Supreme Courtin 1973, Ellen has long since had her baby and given it up foradoption, the only solution the state offers. In the movie's mostpowerful scene, Ellen vainly tugs at the delivery table restraintstrying to get a glimpse of the baby as it is carried away. Shedoesn't even know if it's a boy or a girl.   Ultimately, because the movie tells the story of the women whowon the case, it cannot avoid being pro-choice. ``If you can't takecare of a baby or aren't ready to, it shouldn't matter what thereasons are,'' Weddington argues at one point. ``You shouldn't haveto bear a child and give it up for adoption just because the stateof Texas says so.''   But the other side is treated sympathetically through TerryO'Quinn's eloquently understated portrayal of Jay Floyd, theassistant attorney general assigned the task of defending the Texaslaw. Floyd, like Weddington, has never argued before the SupremeCourt. The bachelor begins receiving mail from women's groups onWeddington's side. One letter suggests he might understand theissue better if he had a uterus transplant.   ``I thought I'd write back that I may not have a uterus, but Iwas definitely a baby,'' Floyd tells a colleague.   When the two lawyers go before the high court, Weddington hasthe force of conviction on her side. Floyd is still struggling withthe issue. He argues for the sanctity of human life, pinpointing itas beginning a vague few days after conception.   ``That's really when the soul comes into the body _ if onebelieves in a soul, I don't know,'' he stammers. Afterward, he isconvinced that the court had already made up its mind. ``Has anyoneever presented so dazzling an argument that it brought themaround?'' he wonders.   No made-for-TV movie can be so dazzling as to change minds on anissue that touches people so deeply. But producer Michael Manheim,producer-director Gregory Hoblit and producer-writer Alison Crosshave run an emotional and political obstacle course and emergedwith an exceptionally fine film. Whatever their point of view, theyshould be congratulated for humanizing the issue and taking a standwhere sticking to the middle ground just wouldn't do.</TEXT><TEXT>   Elsewhere in television:   PUGET SOUND IS LOVELY THIS TIME OF YEAR _ NBC's ``Today'' showwill take a spring West Coast turn through Washington, Oregon andCalifornia the week of May 22-26.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Wed PMs, May 10</NOTE></DOC>
