LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Possibly wide-ranging cuts in military spendingcould hurt some programs of the nation's two largest defensecontractors, but McDonnell Douglas Corp. and General Dynamics Corp.indicated Tuesday they did not feel immediately threatened.   Diversification into areas such as the booming commercialaircraft market, plus expectations of a continuing need for somemajor weapons systems, could soften the impact on both thecompanies and local economies of any cuts.   Defense company stocks fell broadly Monday on word that DefenseSecretary Richard Cheney was considering suggestions for $180billion in spending cuts over the next several years, due to budgetconcerns and reduced tensions in Eastern Europe.   Possible proposals include cutting the Army by 100,000 soldiers,getting rid of 100 Navy ships and closing at least a dozen AirForce bases.   St. Louis-based General Dynamics, down $4.87{ a share on Monday,fell another $1 to $43.12{ on Tuesday. McDonnell Douglas, down$1.12{ Monday, fell another 62{ cents to $67.62{ a share.   At McDonnell Douglas Corp., the St. Louis area's biggestemployer, the cutbacks could hurt the F-15 Eagle and the FA-18Hornet fighter jet programs. The company also makes theAV8B-Harrier, the Harpoon missile and the Tomahawk cruise missile.   But without specific cuts outlined, it was too early tospeculate on the impact on McDonnell Douglas, spokesman Jim Reedsaid.   General Dynamics is the nation's second-largest defensecontractor. While McDonnell Douglas has a commercial aircraftprogram, General Dynamics is defense-oriented and could be morevulnerable to cuts.   But General Dynamics spokesman Pete Connolly said the companydidn't feel threatened because it had concentrated on making basicmilitary equipment.   ``This has been something that we've anticipated, so we've putour bets down on the programs that we think we can do best,''Connolly said. ``The bottom line is we think our strategy has givenus a very strong foothold for the 90s.''   Connolly said the company's F-16 fighter jets, M-1 tanks andTrident and Seawolf submarines were ``the programs that we thinkare going to be around.''   ``Sure, there will be some cutbacks, but we don't see that anyof our programs are going to be on the cancellation list. There'salways going to be a defense requirement in this country _ that'snever going to go away,'' he said.   Any impact on the contractors could be repeated in a number ofother regions with big defense industries, although several expertssaid St. Louis would feel little economic strain if eventual cutswere along the lines of those mentioned by Cheney.   ``Sure, McDonnell Douglas is the largest single employer, butmanufacturing has become a slow second to service areas in generalin the metropolitan area,'' said Murray Weidenbaum, of the Centerfor the Study of American Business at Washington University in St.Louis.   Weidenbaum also said the defense industry was accustomed tocycles, although some past attempts at diversification _ such asGrumman Corp.'s one-time production of powered wheelbarrows _ havenot done well.   ``I don't know what they're going to do, but it isn't easy toturn a large aerospace company around quickly, because they'regeared to producing items that are so different from a civilianitem.''   McDonnell Douglas President Gerald Johnston recentlyacknowledged that the defense industry was likely to have difficultadjustments in the coming years.   ``But I believe our industry is uniquely capable of shiftingfrom military to civil production if called upon to do so,'' hesaid in a recent speech.   Julie Niemann, an analyst from Stifel Nicolaus andamp; Co. Inc., saidMcDonnell Douglas already was relying more heavily on itscommercial aircraft business.   ``They're smart people out there. They knew the defense cutswere coming,'' Niemann said.   McDonnell Douglas' commercial aircraft operation, DouglasAircraft in Long Beach, Calif., is booming and accounts for about30 percent of the company's overall business, McDonnell Douglasofficials said.</TEXT></DOC>
