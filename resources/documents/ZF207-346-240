 Currently in the public-review stage of theformal ANSI standardization process, the specification is expected to befinally approved early next year.andM;SCSI-2 has much more than SCSI-1.andP;  It features more speed, more bandwidth,more flexibility and more powerful options than most OEMs and systemsintegrators require.andM;However, only one vendor is shipping a SCSI-2 host adapter, and that isn'teven a full SCSI-2 implementation.andP;  Controller-chip vendors are at leastthree months away from the next generation of silicon that will maximize theadvantages of SCSI-2.andP;  Disk drive vendors are dragging their feet for avariety of reasons.andP;  All these factors are significantly impeding industryacceptance of the new bus interface.andM;What's the holdup?andM;Obviously, there are reasons for the slow acceptance of SCSI-2.andP;  Moststandards-setting activity has been characteristically slow: ANSI has beenworking on the specification for over two years.andP;  The specification isextremely complex; the ANSI document is almost 600 pages long.andM;SCSI-2 lacks silicon.andP;  Some SCSI-2 features can be implemented using existingchips, but full exploitation requires new chips.andP;  And disk drive vendors arereluctant to add the required hardware, which includes more memory andintelligence.andM;However, systems integrators may have a more important reason for slowlyaccepting SCSI-2.andP;  Few integrators require that much power and they aren'twilling to pay for power that they will never (or rarely) use.andM;'Wide' and 'Fast'andM;SCSI-1 runs at maximum data rates of 2.5M bytes per second in theasynchronous mode and 5M bytes per second in the synchronous mode.andP;  SCSI-2defines two speed-improvement options: &quot;Wide SCSI,&quot; for wider data paths and&quot;Fast SCSI,&quot; for faster data-transfer rates.andM;With Wide SCSI, systems integrators can choose not only 8-bit but also 16-bitand 32-bit data paths.andP;  In contrast, SCSI-1 has only an 8-bit data path.andO;Using 32-bit Wide SCSI at the current synchronous speed, systems integratorscan achieve a 20M-byte-per-second data-transfer rate, which is four times theSCSI-1 data rate.andP;  A 16-bit bus yields 10M bytes per second with Wide SCSI.andM;Fast SCSI doubles the synchronous data rate from 5M bytes per second to 10Mbytes per second over an 8-bit bus.andP;  Therefore, when Fast SCSI is implementedwith the 32-bit Wide-SCSI option, systems integrators could achieve enhancedburst-data rates of 40M bytes per second.andM;Only extremely I/O-intensive applications require SCSI-2's bandwidth andspeed.andP;  Such applications might include graphics, file servers,minicomputer-level transaction processing, multiple-peripheralconfigurations, solid-state disk and disk arrays.andM;Dal Allan, president of ENDL Consulting of Saratoga, Calif., and vicechairman of the ANSI SCSI-2 committee, is more specific.andP;  Allan states, &quot;Theonly valid use for Wide SCSI or Fast SCSI, at the present time, is insolid-state disk or disk arrays.&quot;andP;  In fact, when Ciprico Inc. introduced thefirst SCSI-2 host adapter, it quickly followed with a SCSI-2 disk arraycontroller.andM;First to shipandM;Ciprico started shipping its Rimfire 3550 VMEbus SCSI-2 host adapter lastmonth.andP;  The 3550 uses two key features of SCSI-2: Wide SCSI and taggedcommands, or command queuing.andP;  This results in maximum data-transfer rates of20M bytes per second (synchronous) and 8M bytes per second (asynchronous).andO;Shipments of its Rimfire 6600 parallel-drive array controller were scheduledto begin this month.andP;  The 6600 controls five drives that are based on theenhanced small device interface (ESDI).andM;Admitting that demand for SCSI-2 is still fairly low, Bill Moren, Ciprico'sproduct manager, says, &quot;Effectively complementing the disk array controllerprovided the impetus for quickly developing the SCSI-2 host adapter.&quot;andO;Ciprico's phased-in approach to SCSI-2--implementing Wide SCSI and taggedcommands but not Fast SCSI--is representative of the industry's SCSI-2approach.andM;Most manufacturers of host adapters, controllers and disk drives will take astep-by-step approach to SCSI-2, partly because of the lack of new silicon toexploit Fast-SCSI features.andM;Sample versions of next-generation SCSI chips will probably be available bythe end of the year, with full production beginning early next year.andP;  Forexample, chip maker Western Digital Corp. plans to have a 10M-byte-per-secondversion of its 33C92A chip ready for limited production late this year,according to John Kanzler, product marketing manager for SCSI large-scaleintegration.andM;Similarly, Emulex Corp. could produce a Fast SCSI-2 chip within three months,according to Gary Des Rochers, director of SCSI marketing.andP;  Other key SCSIchip suppliers, such as Adaptec Inc. and NCR Corp.'s MicroelectronicsDivision, report similar time frames.andP;  Additionally, Adaptec recentlyannounced the SDS-3, which is the &quot;first&quot; development system that supportsSCSI-2.andM;Building on foundationandM;However, it's possible to implement most SCSI-2 features via existing chips.andO;Although Ciprico was the first company to accomplish this implementation,other host adapter vendors may follow suit by the end of the year.andM;For example, Xylogics Inc.'s senior vice president of marketing, ChappellCory, discussing a 10M-byte-per-second Wide SCSI-2 host adapter, says, &quot;Ifsomebody wanted such a product, we could produce it in the third quarter, butnobody has expressed interest in such a product.&quot;andM;In the meantime, Xylogics is beefing up existing products and phasing inSCSI-2 functions.andP;  This summer, the company will ship a host adapter thatsupports command queuing and the common command set (CCS), a SCSIspecification subset.andP;  Cory states, &quot;For the bulk of 1989, our customers willneed only CCS.&quot;andM;Obviously, host adapter vendors are taking a wait-and-see approach.andP;  Forexample, Ernest Godsey, director of product marketing at Interphase Corp.,andO;reports, &quot;Customers at the minisupercomputer and file server level requireSCSI-2 bandwidth.andP;  However, because disk drive vendors aren't currentlysupporting SCSI-2, and because there isn't any silicon for Fast SCSI,Interphase won't introduce a SCSI-2 host adapter until at least later thisyear.&quot;andM;Godsey also states, &quot;Supporting SCSI-2 via existing silicon is complicatedand expensive.andP;  New silicon will spur the disk drive vendors to supportadvanced SCSI-2 features and will also lower the price.&quot;andM;Host adapter vendors are unlikely to implement SCSI-2 features at thepersonal computer level until the disk drive vendors implement SCSI-2.andP;  Also,demand is much lower at the personal computer level than in the VMEbus andMultibus arenas.andP;  For example, Future Domain Corp.'s chief technical officer,Allan Pease, claims, &quot;Customer demand at the personal computer level focuseson synchronous SCSI-1 and, to a lesser degree, differential SCSI.andP;  We'rereactive, and we must follow the disk drive vendors.&quot;andM;Disk drive vendors aren't rushing to produce SCSI-2 disk drives; however,they are currently evaluating new chip designs.andP;  And some, such as ImprimisTechnology Inc., have started developing disk drives around the SCSI-2specification.andP;  Full SCSI-2 disk drives will probably not appear until nextyear because of the lack of silicon.andM;Gene Milligan, Imprimis' manager of product planning, says, &quot;Most SCSI-2functionality can be implemented with existing chips and firmware changes,but new chips are urgently required to reduce overhead and to implement FastSCSI/Wide SCSI.&quot;andP;  Milligan expects Imprimis to introduce disk drives withsome SCSI-2 support in the second half of this year or early next year.andO;However, he adds that his company's time frame, and the level of SCSI-2support, depends on whether systems vendors want to wait until Fast SCSI orWide SCSI is available via new controller chips.andM;Disk drive vendors must add memory and intelligence to existing drives inorder to support features like Fast SCSI and Wide SCSI.andP;  Given the ruthlesscompetition and pressures on profit margins prevalent in the disk drivearena, disk drive vendors are reluctant to support features required by onlya relatively small percentage of their customer base.andM;Applications requirementsandM;Although some existing applications call for SCSI-2's speed, futureapplications will be better suited for its high bandwidth.andP;  Such technologiesmight include high-resolution laser printers and optical scanners, diskdrives with parallel-head addressing, or configurations using SCSI as aprocessor-to-processor communications bus.andP;  Until these applications arrive,only high-end disk drive vendors will feel the pressure to implement FastSCSI and Wide SCSI.andM;Space considerations concern disk drive vendors.andP;  As currently defined,SCSI-2 calls for an extra 68-pin connector (B cable) to implement 16-bit WideSCSI or 32-bit Wide SCSI.andP;  Although that situation doesn't pose a problem forlarger disk drives, it's a minor drawback for 5-1/4-inch disk drives and asignificant drawback for 3-1/2-inch disk drives.andP;  ENDL's Allan says, &quot;No3-1/2-inch disk drive vendor in his right mind would put on a secondconnector.&quot; More importantly, current 3-1/2-inch disk drives don't requiremore than 4M-byte-per-second transfers rates, so they definitely can survivewithout Wide SCSI.andM;ANSI participants are still debating the extra-cable issue, but the B cablerequirement will certainly remain in the SCSI-2 specification.andP;  However, afaction within the ANSI group, comprised predominantly of peripheral vendors,have proposed an alternative scheme--a single, 16-bit connector.andP;  Thatproposal will likely be tabled for SCSI-3 discussions.andM;Partly because of added costs and partly because of the extra-cablerequirement, 5-1/4-inch disk drive vendors may adopt Fast SCSI before WideSCSI.andP;  Thus, these disk drive vendors must wait for the next-generationsilicon.andP;  Kanzler predicts, &quot;On the peripheral side, I think you'll seeFast-SCSI implementations more rapidly than Wide-SCSI implementations.&quot;andM;Implementation methodandM;Most systems integrators agree that implementing Fast SCSI requiresdifferential drivers and receivers; some do think that a single-ended SCSImode provides a workable solution.andP;  However, implementing Fast SCSI via asingle-ended SCSI mode requires tight control of termination voltages, aswell as short cables (e.g., 2 to 3 feet).andM;The preferred method for implementing Fast SCSI uses differential drivers andreceivers, but this method significantly drives up system costs.andO;(Differential drivers and receivers, and single-ended SCSI modes, are twoSCSI electrical-interconnection alternatives).andM;Allan says, &quot;Fast SCSI requires differential drivers and receivers.andP;  Forthose companies with differential SCSI, they should migrate to Fast SCSI,because it's an easy upgrade and you don't need the extra connector.&quot;andM;However, adding SCSI-2 features like command queuing isn't expensive for diskdrive vendors.andP;  (SCSI-2 command queuing allows 256 commands to be issued fromeach initiator to each logical unit.)andP;  Thus, host adapter vendors want diskdrive vendors to phase in such features.andP;  Godsey, of Interphase, says,&quot;Command queuing will give SCSI a healthy boost, but there's no reason forInterphase to implement command queuing until the disk drive vendorsimplement it.&quot;andM;Systems integrators should note that SCSI-2 taxes many computers'capabilities.andP;  For example, most VMEbus CPU boards can handle10M-byte-per-second or 20M-byte-per-second transfer rates, but a40M-byte-per-second transfer rate is too fast for current VMEbus technology.andO;Even a 20M-byte-per-second SCSI-2 implementation would consume considerableVMEbus bandwidth.andP;  Nevertheless, analysts agree that systems-levelintegrators and OEMs will push disk drive vendors to support SCSI-2.andM;However, don't expect that push to come until systems-level technologyadvances.andP;  Allan states, &quot;I don't know of any host system [with a normal diskdrive or tape drive] that would run better using Wide SCSI, Fast SCSI orcommand queuing.&quot;andM;The real SCSI-2andM;Clouding the SCSI-2 controversy is the varying degrees of SCSI-2 adoption.andO;For example, some vendors legitimately claim SCSI-2 compatibility when, inreality, they have only implemented the CCS SCSI subset.andM;The CCS, which gave a needed boost to, and is included in, most SCSI-1products, is fully documented in the SCSI-2 specification.andP;  To claim SCSI-2compatibility, a product must comply with the CCS.andM;However, the new CCS adds commands to support other peripherals like tapedrives, optical disk drives, scanners and communications devices.andP;  OEMs andsystems integrators are particularly interested in the standardization thatthe CCS allows.andM;Host adapter vendors are adding SCSI-2 CCS commands when required by theircustomers.andP;  For example, Interphase may ship host adapters with SCSI-2 CCScommands in the third quarter, assuming that peripheral vendors support thoseCCS functions.andM;Compatibility issueandM;Partial adoption of the SCSI-2 specification represents only one facet of thepotential compatibility problem.andP;  The lack of compatibility among SCSIproducts has plagued the SCSI-1 market; however, the CCS and common accessmethod (CAM) promise to rectify that problem (See Systems Integrationmagazine, April, Page 29).andP;  Systems integrators burned by compatibilityproblems in the SCSI-1 market are afraid that they'll encounter compatibilityproblems in the SCSI-2 market.andM;On the positive side, SCSI-2 is compatible with SCSI-1.andP;  Thus, disk drivevendors and systems-level OEMs can implement SCSI-2 functions on existingdisk drives and controllers, and, theoretically, SCSI-2 products will workwith SCSI-1 products.andP;  In fact, some existing SCSI-1 products already havesome SCSI-2 functions built-in.andM;Nevertheless, like SCSI-1, SCSI-2's promise of universal compatibility isdubious.andP;  The specification has many options and, as usual, companies willattempt to differentiate their products by adding vendor-unique features.andO;Compatibility will continue to be a key concern with SCSI-2, particularly inthe systems integration community.andP;  Furthermore, the specification's featuresare subject to interpretation.andM;&quot;It's doubtful that the industry can achieve complete compatibility betweenFast SCSI and Wide SCSI and 'Slow SCSI' and 'Narrow SCSI,'&quot; Godsey predicts.andM;SCSI-2 may not measure up to its proponents' expectations.andP;  After all, SCSI-2significantly complicates an already complicated bus.andP;  George Robinson,president of FlexStar Corp., a manufacturer of peripheral test equipment,cautions, &quot;Many people don't understand SCSI, and, unfortunately, thatsituation might worsen because of SCSI-2's complexity.&quot;andM;In addition, systems integrators must weigh the pros and cons of SCSI-2 andits closest competitor, the intelligent peripheral interface (IPI).andP;  (See&quot;Command Performance.&quot;)andM;Most importantly, however, systems integrators must ask themselves if theyneed all, or any, of the SCSI-2 options.andP;  Allan says, &quot;Wide SCSI, Fast SCSIand command queuing aren't needed today by systems integrators.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
