On a 320-97 vote the House approved the biggest financial rescuein history from a crisis caused largely by risky and oftenfraudulent lending of federally insured deposits, primarily inTexas, California and Florida.   Fifty-one Democrats and 46 Republicans voted against the bill.Voting for the bill were 196 Democrats and 124 Republicans.   ``The American taxpayers won a major victory today when the Housevoted for strong, tangible capital requirements ...,'' said TreasurySecretary Nicholas Brady. ``They have taken a very positive steptoward ensuring the resolution of the savings and loan crisis.''   At the White House, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwatersaid in a conference call to news organizations, ``We are pleased bythis bipartisan step toward final passage ... We applaud the Houseleadership for moving this bill rapidly through the House.''   The vote on final passage occurred after Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa,the leading Republican crusader against Sandamp;L abuses in the House, wonan amendment to eliminate several special-interest provisionsbenefitting specific companies.   Among the provisions eliminated were those aimed at helpingSears; Chemical Bank of New York; First Interstate Bank of LosAngeles; Citicorp; Merrill Lynch, Paine Webber and other brokeragehouses; Citizens Federal Savings Bank of Miami and Great WesternSavings Bank, one of the largest Sandamp;Ls in California.   Bush had threatened earlier Thursday to veto the measure if theHouse adopted an industry-sought amendment by Rep. Henry Hyde,R-Ill., to give 241 thrift institutions a mechanism to escape havingto raise $6 billion in new capital as a hedge against future loanlosses.   The amendment was defeated by a 326-94 vote after Bush issued hisveto threat and Democrats repeated assertions that it would gut thereforms needed to prevent an recurrence of the crisis.   ``This amendment would have allowed weak institutions to delayand delay and delay the day of reckoning,'' said Rep. CharlesSchumer, D-N.Y. ``And while they delay and delay and delay, thetaxpayers pay and pay and pay.''   The bill next goes to a conference committee of lawmakers whowill iron out differences from a Senate version approved two monthsago. With Sandamp;L losses mounting at a rate of nearly $40 million a day,the administration wants the bill enacted into law before Congresstakes its August vacation.   Before enacting the bill, the House rejected on a largelyparty-line 280-146 vote Bush's plan to finance the bailout throughhigh-cost, 30-year off-budget bonds rather than new borrowingdirectly through the Treasury.   ``This is a vote to save the taxpayer $5 billion in interestcosts,'' said Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of thetax-writing House Ways and Means Committee.   Only Democrats Carroll Hubbard of Kentucky, Tommy Robinson ofArkansas and Ralph Hall of Texas supported Bush's plan. Alsorejected by a similar margin was an effort to force a tax increaseor massive spending cuts to pay for the bailout.   However, the House amended Bush's original proposal on a 208-206vote to make the industry subsidize low-income housing by $75million to $150 million a year and outlaw Sandamp;L investments in junkbonds.   The House also adopted a amendment opposed by the administrationas well as the Sandamp;L and banking industries to make lenders disclosedata on their lending by race and locality in an effort to wipe outso-called ``redlining'' discrimination.   Basically the bill calls for spending a total of $285 billion _including interest over the next 30 years _ to close or mergebetween 450 and 600 of the nation's 2,938 Sandamp;Ls whose estimatedlosses total about $100 billion.   Of the total spending, about $157 billion would come fromtaxpayers and the balance from the industry, according to theGeneral Accounting Office.   Only 56 of the House's 175 Republicans ended up supporting Hyde'smeasure after GOP Leader Bob Michel reluctantly switched sides inresponse to a strong letter from Bush appealing for support.Democrats voted 212-38 to reject the amendment.   Hyde's measure would have required federal regulators to granthearings to marginally healthy Sandamp;Ls before phasing out exemptions tocapital requirements granted by regulators in the early 1980s for``supervisory good will.''   In a letter to Michel just before the vote, Bush said approval ofthe Hyde amendment ``would render this bill unacceptable to me.''The president said that ``giving recognition to good will as capital... is not justifiable.''   ``There should be no mistake,'' Bush wrote. ``This matter goes tothe very heart of my determination to clean up the abuses of thepast among the savings and loans, about which every voter isentitled to be outraged.''   In April, the Senate defeated by a 50-48 vote an effort byDemocrats to make the bailout part of the deficit. And Sen. PhilGramm, R-Texas, has collected signatures from 40 colleagues over thelast week pledging to support Bush's financing plan.   Hyde said his ``good will'' amendment was intended only to grantthe constitutional right of a hearing to the 8 percent of theindustry that took over failing thrifts in the early 1980s and savedtaxpayers $13 billion then.   ``The Sandamp;Ls who find themselves victimized by this legislation arenot the bad guys, the high flyers,'' he said. ``The only sin they'reguilty of is trusting the federal regulators. They deserve a hearingbefore the sword falls, before the scarlet letter is placed on theirforehead.''   Critics, however, said Hyde's amendment would have gutted thechief reform elements of the bailout _ assuring that every Sandamp;L ownerputs up some of it own money as a buffer between risky loans thatmay go bad and the federal deposit insurance fund.   The fund is now running an estimated deficit of $55 billion thatis growing by at about $40 million a day because the governmentlacks the money to close some 450 insolvent Sandamp;Ls and pay off theirdepositors.</TEXT></DOC>
