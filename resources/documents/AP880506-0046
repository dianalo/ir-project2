Caliguiri, mayor of Pittsburghsince 1977, died early today at a hospital, according to theAllegheny County Coroner's Office. He was 56 years old.   The mayor died at 1:36 a.m. of cardiac amyloidosis, a rare,incurable disease which deposited dangerous amounts of protein inhis heart and other major organs, according to the coroner's office.   Caliguiri was taken to Shadyside Hospital around 12:45 a.m. Aparamedic pounded on the mayor's chest and tubes had been insertedinto his mouth, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.   Paramedics were called to the mayor's home at 12:10 a.m., thenewspaper said. He was carried from his home about a half-hourlater on a stretcher.   The mayor's wife Jeanne, and one of his sons, followed the cityambulance carrying Caliguiri to the hospital, the newspaper said.   Caliguiri stunned Pittsburgh in October when he disclosed thathe suffered from the non-contagious disease whose cause is unknown.   Caliguiri became aware that something was wrong with him inMarch 1987 when he became dizzy while playing golf. After tests,doctors determined Caliguiri suffered from the disease but nothingwas said publicly until later that year.   Last summer, friends and political acquantainces began to noticethat Caliguiri, who was short in stature, looked pale and eventhinner than his normal weight of 140 pounds.   For a while, he dismissed concern by saying it was only anintestinal ailment, but finally on Oct. 2, he revealed the truenature of his illness.   On Dec. 24, 1987, surgeons at Shadyside Hospital inserted apacemaker in Caliguiri's chest to regulate his heartbeat.   Earlier this week, Dr. James O'Toole, Caliguiri's cardiologist,said he was evalutaing the possibility ofa heart transplant for themayor.   Caliguiri, a Democrat, first became mayor of Pittsburgh in 1977.   In addition to his wife, Caliguiri is survived by two sons,Gregg and David.</TEXT></DOC>
