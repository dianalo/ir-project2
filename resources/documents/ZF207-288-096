 First off are three newMS-DOS micros, which can be used either as stand-alone products, or linked upwith System/3X and AS/400s machines.andP;  The 5070 is a 16MHz 80386-based machineto run both MS-DOS and OS/2.andP;  It comes with 2Mb RAM, a 32-bit proprietaryexpansion slot, five AT-compatible slots, and two async and one parallelprinter port.andP;  It also features a video adaptor, for use with eithermonochrome or colour monitors.andP;  The 5053 has an Intel 16-bit multi-processingunit, operating at either 12MHz or 8MHz.andP;  It offers 1Mb of RAM, expandable toa maximum of 16Mb on the system board, one async port, and one parallelprinter port.andP;  Last comes the 8086-based 5030, which operates at 9.6MHz or8MHz.andP;  It accommodates two 3.5&quot; and one 5.25&quot; disk drives, one serial, andone parallel printer port.andP;  The 5070, 5053, and 5030 cost $2,800, $1,600, and$900 respectively.andP;  Meanwhile, a new Series 7400 rack-mounted, modular tapesubsystem marks the company's entry into the high-capacity storage market.andO;The offering, described by Decision Data as quiet, and economical on floor space, comprises a 7420 reel-to-reel half-inch tape drive, and a 7460cartridge tape drive.andP;  The 7420 offers dual density formats, a625Kb-per-second data transfer rate, and costs $27,500.andP;  The 7460 uses 8mmcartridges, holds a maximum of 2.3Gb data, requires 120 volts of electricity,and is priced at $18,900.andP;  Final offerings are a workstation providing IBM3196 and 5291 emulation, and an on-line power system for emergency System/3Xand AS/400 back-up procedures.andP;  The 3596 measures 9&quot; in diameter, has a 14&quot;monochrome monitor, and a choice of 102 or 122 key key- board.andP;  It costs$1,200.andP;  The power system comprises two 5995 modules, supplying 37.5KV- or56.25KVolt-Amps, to provide 40 minutes of uninterruptible, back-up power.andO;Prices for the 37.5K- VA version start at $32,600, and at $38,600 for the56.25K-VA module.andM;IBM Decision Support Positioning - 1andM;The authorised IBM version of what decision support systems,andM;activities are all aboutandM;With the launch of the Data Interpretation System from MetaphorandM;(CI No 1,180) and new versions of Application System and Personal ApplicationSystem, IBM thought it was time to clarify where its decision supportproducts fit in with each other - explaining that executive support systemsare separate from, albeit closely related to, office and decision supportsystems.andP;  Executive support systems, it says, provide access for senior staffto computer-based systems for any business function.andP;  Their distinguishingcharacteristic is that they give access to information or tools in a way that&quot;matches the executive's distinctive needs&quot;.andP;  Hence Executive Decisions/VM(CI No 1,182), which is also closely related to OfficeVision Family and to AS2.andP;  But before getting on to IBM's perception of its own products, somegeneral (mainly IBM) words on what decision support is all about.andM;Necessary characteristicsandM;A key element of any decision support system, says IBM, is itsandM;ability to retrieve data.andP;  Customers require access to a broad range ofinternal and external business data.andP;  Data may be personal, departmental, orcorporate level.andP;  Data formats include both IBM and non-IBM data as well asrelational and nonrelational structures.andP;  Non-IBM data includes OEM databasesand public data  banks, such as Dow-Jones.andP;  Users need to be able to selectonly the required data, in the desired sequence, and to have that datalogically combined from multiple tables or databases to create the desireddata view.andP;  Most decision support activities are performed upon existingdata, but the user must have the capability to define, create and maintainpersonal data that is used in decision-making processes.andP;  In some cases, itmay be desirable for the decision support user to modify departmental andother databases that go beyond personal use.andP;  In addition, the decisionsupport system must provide data validation, audit and security functions toensure integrity of the data.andP;  To begin to make effective use of the data,users need to be able to create logically new information from existing data.andO;The system must allow new columns of data to be created by the application ofsimple calculations and summary functions.andP;  For example, says IBM, a user maywant to know the average number of hours worked by an employee within adepartment.andP;  Another user may want to calculate a &quot;Salary&quot; by adding &quot;BaseSalary&quot; to &quot;Commission.&quot;andP;  Simple arithmetic operations such as addition,multiplication as well as basic summary functions such as sums, average, andrunning totals, are supplied by decision support data manipulation functions.andO;Once the data is in usable form, there are more specialised tools  andprocesses to perform analysis to assist decision-making - such things ascalculations and defined formulae; spreadsheet; modelling with support for&quot;What if&quot; scenarios; statistics for applications such as forecasting; projectmanagement with the tools to plan and schedule resources, apply risk analysisto calculate probable completion dates, and analyse the impact uponenterprise productivity and profitability; linear programming to find thebest solution that both satisfies all the constraints in a problem whilemeeting the user's objectives; graphical presentation tools; communications;and facilities to define, save, and run user-created tasks on a repetitivebasis.andP;  And it needs to be accessible and easy to use, other necessarycharacteristics including flexibility, a fast response time, availability tothose who need to use it, and immediacy of results.andM;The target users of decision supportandM;At whom are decision support systems aimed?andP;  Anyone in anandM;organisation that makes decisions that affect their jobs - a brand manageruses decision support the better to understand the competition, the effect ofpromotional schemes upon sales, and so forth.andP;  A school administrator usesdecision support to help plan and project teachers' salaries for the nextterm.andP;  IBM divides such users into two major groups - primary users andsupportive users.andP;  Primary users are the individuals who use the decisionsupport and derive direct benefit from it - typically the decision makers inan organisation and the staff that assist them.andP;  They understand the problemto be solved, have the tools to provide a solution, and use the toolsthemselves to solve the problem.andP;  The brand manager and school administratorin the examples are primary users - but so are secretaries and clerks thatoperate the decision support on behalf of others.andP;  Supportive users simplyenable primary users to make more effective use of the decision supportsystem - helping them to use it, creating applications, organising thedatabase in an appropriate manner, and providing the means for the qualifiedpeople to access it.andM;The distinguishing features of decision supportandM;systemsandM;What distinguishes decision support from other businessandM;applications?andP;  A priori that it is personal.andP;  Decision support is an activitythat implies personal business use, says IBM, in other words the operator ofthe decision support system is the one who receives benefit personally - incontrast to a batch or production system, which is generally operated by athird party who may have no personal interest in nor benefit from theresults.andP;  &quot;Data is central to any decision support system&quot; says IBM ratherobviously, &quot;because it is the data transformed to usable information thatassists the user in making decisions.andP;  The data itself is characterised bybeing extracted from any number or kinds of sources, whether it be local orremote, departmental or corporate&quot;.andP;  And decision support is used primarilyfor non-operational applications.andP;  &quot;Much decision support activity involvesunanticipated results and use of the system in a flexible, non-structuredmanner.andP;  Decision support is not used for transaction-processing systems, noris it generally suited for multiple concurrent data update&quot;.andP;  A decisionsupport is also characterised by supporting two modes of operation, ad hocand repetitive, IBM reckons, adding that most users will operate a system inboth modes at different times - the manufacturing floor manager queries theparts database to determine whether a required item is in stock - an ad-hoctask; the business analyst has to run the sales analysis and procedure eachmonth to present to management or the board - a repetitive ta-.andM;How IBM sees its decision support systems fitting with eachandM;other and the IBM worldandM;So that is IBM's perception of what decision support systems areandM;all about - and IBM clearly thinks that they are very Good Things indeed,because the OfficeVision announcement brought the number it offers up to four- although Personal Application System is really a subset of or companion tomainframe Application System, depending on how you choose to use it, and IBMdefines Executive Decisions/VM as a related product, but not on its owndefinition, a decision support system, even though that seems to be exactlywhat it does.andP;  In IBM's view, the products provide a complementary range ofdecision support functions and are designed to meet the needs of a variety ofusers in multiple operational environments - even though many users wouldlikely be spared the embarrassment of choice and be offered one product thatwas able to meet all conceivable needs - but in the IBM scheme of things,&quot;customers can select not only the function required for their operatingenvironment but can also choose the look and feel that best suits theirusers' needs&quot;.andP;  That's the way IBM likes it: who dare argue with Big Mother?andM;The general features of the productsandM;Application System and the programmable workstation version,andM;Personal AS - a programmable workstation is what we are all more used tocalling a personal computer - are IBM's general purpose decision supportproducts, providing broad-based function for the business professional andadministrative users under VM, MVS and OS/2, and are recommended where endusers require an integrated set of high-function tools - report writing,graphics, query, statistics, application development, business planning andproject management.andP;  And Personal AS can be run as a stand-alone personalcomputer product, or can also be used to exchange data, business graphics andreport specifications with host AS 2.andP;  The Data Interpretation System,conceived by Metaphor Computer Systems but now presented as an IBMapplication, from is most applicable for gathering and analysing largeamounts of detailed business information from remote or local relationaldatabases, and exploits the full technical capabilities of an advanced localarea network; it is particularly appropriate to the needs of departments, IBMreckons.andP;  Tools include an easy-to-use graphical interface to query, reports,business graphics, spreadsheet, text, mail, and development functions.andM;The relationship with OfficeVisionandM;AS 2 and Personal AS 2 provide decision can be used in theandM;OfficeVision Family environment, and, like Executive Decisions/VM, enableusers to combine decision support activities such as data access and analysiswith office tasks such as creating notes and documents, and using electronicmail to communicate results.andP;  The Personal AS base is included inOfficeVision/2 Release 2 and the four options can be installed asfully-compatible options for the OfficeVision/2 LAN Series.andP;  DataInterpretation System is separately offered from OfficeVision but providescommunication to Profs and VM Notes so that people using it can OfficeVisionusers, and IBM promises that it will someday 9support swapping of notes withOfficeVision/MVS, /VM and /400.andM;How executive support systems fit inandM;IBM acknowledges that executive support systems are closelyandM;related to office and decision support systems but are distinguished by thatfact that they provide access for senior executives or the executive'ssupport staff to computer-based systems for any business function, and tomeet those needs, it has to exhibit &quot;a high degree of sophistication&quot; -whatever that means: executives are generally such computilliterates thatanything remotely tricky must be eliminated, or their needs are so demandingand diverse that a support system has to be enormously versatile andpowerful?andP;  IBM doesn't say.andM;Application System, Personal ASandM;So what do you get with each?andP;  AS 2 offers a wide range ofandM;integrated decision support function including query, report writer, dataentry and edit, business graphics, business planning, project management,linear programming, statistics, and application creation; a new &quot;easy-to-use&quot;end-user interface similar to Personal Application System 2 that can beoperated by keyboard or mouse; access to SQL/DS, DB2 and VSAM data; a newCustomisable Data Interface for access to non-IBM data and other IBM datatypes; data, report specification and business graphics specificationexchange with Personal Application System 2.andP;  It is aimed at managerstechnical professionals, scientists, engineers, business professionals andadministrators and clerical workers.andP;  IBM highlights the bundled easy to useApplication Preparation Feature, which provides a menu-driven,point-and-select interface for the novice or infrequent user for applicationcreation - and all applications can be shared.andP;  Users can also access QueryManagement Facility, Profs and OfficeVision/VM from within an AS session.andP;  Italso provides graphics, reports, and other data for Executive Decisions/VM,and can be used from a 3270.andP;  Personal AS base includes Query, Reports,Business Graphics, Data Entry and Procedures; Statistics, Business planning,Project management and Development are optional.andP;  It runs under OS/2 Standard1.2 as well as Extended 1.2, on a PS/2 Model 50Z up.andM;The powerful Data Interpretation SystemandM;Key features, in IBM's view, of Data Interpretation System,andM;include the intuitive, iconic application tools that result in easily usedand modified applications; the dynamic retrieval by end users of data frommultiple relational databases - with support for the OS/2 and OS/400environments promised.andP;  Graphic tools are used to manage databases andadminister the system local network, and the thing can interconnectdepartments within an organisation.andP;  Using a technique called Capsules, usersget a graphical and iconic interface to create patterns of data flows andsketch graphically the relationships of tasks that make up the application.andO;Objects - queries, reports, graphs, spreadsheets, documents or entireCapsules - can be shared on the same or inter-connected local networks.andO;Results of database queries can be analysed using an integrated spreadsheetor other tools, and a spreadsheet translator converts standard Lotusworksheet formats to the integrated Data Interpretation System spreadsheet.andO;And, in the first mention IBM makes of Metaphor, it says thatinter-networking is provided between nets running the IBM and the MetaphorData Interpretation Systems.andP;  IBM sees it as most appropriate to workgroupsthat need to make heavy regular use of mainframe databases.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
