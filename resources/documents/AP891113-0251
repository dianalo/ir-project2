BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The changing make-up of the American family willoffset declining population and keep demand for housing strongduring the 1990s, according to a study released Monday.   The Realtors, meeting in Dallas, also released quarterly surveysof house prices and sales, showing a 2.7 percent increase in resaleprices of single family houses, spurred by lower interest rates andrecovering markets in the South and Midwest.   Meanwhile, the national median price for a house rose 2.1percent to $95,000 although there were wide regional differences,the Realtors said.   ``What we've got here is a picture of a housing market in whichactivity remains historically strong, but varies across thecountry,'' said John Tuccillo, the Realtors' chief economist.``It's a market in which home prices are appreciating slightlygreater than the rate of inflation, but again with strong regionalvariations.''   The study, ``Demographics in the U.S.: The Segmenting of HousingDemand,'' concluded the market for housing will be driven bychanges in character of the nation's population.   ``Households comprised of a husband, wife and children, havingcomparable incomes, and manifesting similar housing needs no longcomprise the overwhelming majority of U.S. households,'' the studysays.   ``Today's households include large and increasing contingents ofsingles, single-parents, cohabiting couples, elderly, immigrants,affluent and poor,'' the study says. ``Moreover, regionaldisparities in housing demand, already substantial, are likely toheighten as mobility, migration and immigration rates also continueto increase.''   The study says these changes will negate the effects of adeclining population in the post-baby boom generation.   ``As the leading edge of the baby boom moves through its peakearning years, demand will pick up for second homes and retirementhomes,'' Tuccillo said. Demand will shift to ``smaller units insunny climates.''   ``High levels of migration and immigration will continue to meanhigh levels of housing demand in selected areas, for example in theSouth and West regions,'' the study says. ``Increasing populationmobility coupled with increasing fluidity among household types islikely to mean higher rates of housing turnover throughout thecountry.''   ``The healthy markets will offer diversity,'' said outgoingPresident Ira Gribin. ``They will have a variety of niche-orientedhousing.''   Some of these niches identified include trade-ups for currenthome-owners, or smaller homes for retired persons.   The study also found a growing disparity in housingaffordability between the highest and lowest income groups.   ``Households toward the upper end of the income and wealthdistributions are seen as enjoying sizeable gains in affluence,thereby permitting substantially increased housing consumption, forexample, by homeowners `moving up.'   ``On the other hand, households near the lower end of thedistributions _ whether because of lagging real earnings, increasedsingle-parent households, or ill-fortune _ appear to be havingincreasing difficulty in obtaining suitable low-cost housing,'' thestudy says.   As a result, affordable housing is perceived as an increasingproblem for many U.S. families and individuals.   Meanwhile, the Realtors' found prices and activity were on theupswing in much of the country, although even within regions therewere significant differences.   Nationally, the median price was $95,000, up from $93,000 in thesecond quarter this year and a 5.3 percent increase from the thirdquarter last year.   The Northeast region remains the most expensive, with a medianprice of $147,000, up from $145,900 in the second quarter, but justa 1.5 percent rise from the third quarter last year.   Houses in the West have appreciated the most, jumping 11.7percent from $126,800 last year to $141,600 this year.   The South's median price was $85,800, an increase from thesecond quarter's $83,800 and a 3.1 percent from the same quarterlast year. In the Midwest, the median price was $72,400, up fromthe second quarter's $70,900 and a 5.1 percent rise from lastyear's $68,900.   South Dakota saw the largest percentage jump in resale ofexisting single-family detached homes, town houses, apartmentcondominiums and co-operatives, increasing 31.6 percent from thesecond quarter. In all, 36 states and Washington, D.C., hadincreased resales.   Utah has the largest decrease, as resales there fell 14.6percent.   California led in the number of sales with 501,600, almost twiceas much as second-place Pennsylvania at 259,900. Placing third with226,500 sales was Texas, where real estate values have beendepressed following the collapse of energy prices in the mid-1980s.   Honolulu and the San Francisco Bay area remained the mostexpensive areas, with median home prices of $275,000 in Honoluluand $269,400 in San Francisco. Orange County, Calif., is the thirdmost expensive at $249,100 followed by Los Angeles at $224,600.   Peoria, Ill., remained the least expensive, with a median priceof $48,700, followed by Spokane, Wash., at $52,700.</TEXT></DOC>
