<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-52-1204 </DOCNO><TEXT>The authors assess the feasibility of recreating the mechanical propertiesof tungsten carbides in a titanium carbide-chromium steel composite forthe purpose of conserving tungsten and reducing materials costs in theproduction of highly wear-resistant alloys. To this end they investigatethe effects of production, materials content, surface hardening, andtempering on the abrasive wear resistance and impact and flexural strengthof several alloy compositions.</TEXT></DOC>
