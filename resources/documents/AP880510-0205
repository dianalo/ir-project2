Most of those retirees have lost all of their Social Securitybenefits, according to a report by the General Accounting Office.   It said Social Security's master beneficiary record for lastJanuary showed that three-quarters of those affected were men.   Congress adopted the measure to eliminate what lawmakersregarded as a windfall for civil servants who were not coveredthemselves by Social Security, but who wound up receiving benefitsthrough their spouses.   The GAO said 104,608 workers had their benefits reduced as aresult of the audit. The agency said 71 percent of the federalworkers checked were drawing an average yearly pension of $16,944.   Most had their Social Security benefits eliminated entirely,costing those workers an average of $178 a month or $2,136 a year.   The law reduces the Social Security spousal or survivor'sbenefits of a government retiree by $2 for every $3 of publicpension. It applies only to government workers not covered on theirown jobs by Social Security. Most civil servants _ including allfederal workers hired since 1984 _ are covered by Social Security.   For most families, Social Security pays spouses' benefits toelderly husbands or wives regardless of whether they contributed tothe system. An elderly spouse can draw a benefit half as large asthe working spouse's; if she survives him, she receives the largerof the two benefits.</TEXT></DOC>
