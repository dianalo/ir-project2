The settlement, which is subject to mutually satisfactory terms, would relieve General Host of any further liability for the pending claim and all future claims by the plaintiffs.    As a result, General Host, based here, said it will take an after-tax charge for discontinued operations of approximately $3.4 million, or 17 cents a share, in its second quarter ended Aug. 13.    Local landowners in Lyons, Kan., sought recovery for claimed damages since 1983, claiming saltwater pollution of their underground water supply prevented irrigation to their farmland. The suits alleged that the pollution was caused by operations of American Salt Co., a salt-mining plant near Lyons, owned until 1988 by General Host's AMS Industries Inc. subsidiary.    The company recently paid $18.9 million, including interest, to essentially the same plaintiffs in a similar case dating back to 1977.    General Host, a retailer of food, plant and craft products, said this payment will not have an impact on current income, since an after-tax charge for its cost was made to discontinued operations last year. </TEXT></DOC>
