The rocket blasted off at 7:28 p.m. from this jungle spacecenter on the northern coast of South America _ Ariane's 21stlaunching and the first of eight planned for this year.   Andre Payet, chief of mission, said no technical problems werereported and weather conditions were good for the launch of therocket, owned by the European Space Agency.   The launch was first scheduled for December but was delayed forextra tests after anomalies were detected in the oxygen and liquidhydrogen third-stage engine.   ``We preferred to take the time to understand the problem,''said Frederic d'Allest, president of Arianespace, ESA's commercialarm.   Third-stage engine failure was the cause of three of Ariane'sfour failed launches _ in September 1982, September 1985 and May1986. The last failure, the 18th launch, left the rocket groundedfor more than a year.   The other failed launch occurred in May 1980 because of aproblem with the first-stage engine.   Ariane produced a perfect 20th launch Nov. 21, 1987, but theWest German television satellite it placed into orbit developedproblems with its solar panels and is not fully operational.   The 21st launch will thrust into orbit the American GTE SpacenetCorp.'s fifth satellite, Spacenet III R-Geostar R01. The satelliteis aimed at increasing the company's wide-rangingtelecommunications services in the United States and help set up asystem of satellite communication with mobile units such as trucks,cars and trains.   Two transponders on Spacenet III purchased by The AssociatedPress are to provide the New York-based news cooperative withdomestic satellite delivery services over the next 10 years. Asatellite being used is nearing the end of its operational service.   The French Telecom IC, the third in a series of satellites ownedby France Telecom, the state-owned telecommunications system, isused for telephones, radio and television transmissions as well asmilitary communications.   The new satellite is to replace Telecom 1-B, which broke downJan. 15.   With the U.S. space shuttle grounded and Titan 4 and Deltarockets not yet competitive, Ariane remains the only activelauncher for commercial satellites in the West. However,Arianespace is watching the return of the Americans to thelucrative space market as well as competition from the SovietUnion, China and Japan.   Including Friday's payload, Arianespace has 43 satellites on itsorder books worth $2.36 billion, according to the company.   To keep up with the orders, the Kourou space center has made twolaunch pads available.   Ariane's 21st launch is to be the first of eight this year, withnine launches each planned for 1989 and 1990, d'Allest said earlierthis week.</TEXT></DOC>
