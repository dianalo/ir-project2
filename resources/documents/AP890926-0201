Of the 15,352 tests conducted Jan. 1, 1988 through April 30,1989, there were 99 positives for drug use, according to the``Drug-Free Workplace Program Evaluation Report'' for September1989, announced by Melissa J. Allen of the TransportationDepartment.   ``Marijuana use accounted for approximately two-thirds ofpositives with cocaine accounting for all but a small percentage ofthe rest,'' the report says.   The total cost for the department's drug program in fiscal 1988,which ended last Sept. 30, was over $4 million, coveringcollection, laboratory testing, staff support and informationalservices, according to the report.   Federal Aviation Administration employees accounted for 95percent of those tested under the random testing program whichfocuses on safety and security personnel whose actions have adirect and immediate impact on the public health and safety, theprotection of life and property, law enforcement or nationalsecurity.   Of these so-called Category 1 employees, 65 percent are airtraffic controllers, 16 percent are electronic technicians, 4percent are air traffic assistants, 3 percent are aviation safetyinspectors, and 12 percent hold other jobs.   A total of 92 percent of supervisors and 72 percent of theemployees tested who were surveyed later by the department saidtheir individual privacy was protected during the specimencollection process.   However, comments on the questionnaire ``also spoke to isolatedinstances where (specimen) collectors acted in an unprofessionalmanner and employees felt the collection process was conducted in a`degrading' manner,'' the report says, noting that Customs Serviceemployees who have been subjected to drug tests also havecriticized contractors conducting the tests.   In addition to the widespread random testing, the departmentalso conducted reasonable suspicion testing, post-accident testingand follow-up testing.   There were only 17 reasonable suspicion tests department-widefrom Jan. 1, 1988 through April 30, 1989, and they resulted ineight verified positives for drug use, according to the report.   At the same time, there were 26 post-accident drug tests in theFAA and two in the U.S. Coast Guard, and all were negative.   In follow-up testing, 105 employees who had been identified asusing an illegal substance were subjected to a total of 659follow-ups, and these tests found 26 verified positives, orapproximately 25 percent of the employees, the report says.   Regarding the random testing, the report concludes that randomselection of employees has been accomplished, but ``many employeesdo not appear to fully understand the random selection process andtherefore are skeptical of its validity. ... There seems to be animpression that selection of specific individuals drives the randomselection process,''   The report says the process selects facilities on a random basiswith names of employees also listed in random order, and that theDepartmental Drug Office was developing an informational videotapeto outline the process for employees.   Drug program personnel, meanwhile, are questioning whether thedepartment could achieve the same level of deterrence with lessthan a 50 percent annual random sample, and the report calls forthe drug office to assess what level of random testing would bebest.</TEXT></DOC>
