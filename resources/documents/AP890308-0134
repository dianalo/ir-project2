Thousands more areraped, assaulted and sexually harassed.   These startling estimates are set forth in a new report byWorldwatch Institute, a Washington-based research group, thatmaintains violence against women is a pervasive yet largely ignoredproblem that affects all societies and socioeconomic groups,particularly in the Indian subcontinent and Africa.   ``If a person is murdered because of his or her politics, theworld justifiably responds with outrage. But if a person is beatenor allowed to die because she is female, the world dismisses it as`cultural tradition,''' writes Lori Heise, a senior researcher atthe institute.   Over the last generation, women in many countries have made longstrides towards achieving equality. These advances were highlightedat many gatherings Wednesday on the occasion of the 79th annualInternational Women's Day, a congressionally sanctioned observanceheld each March 8.   But, as Heise describes it, the observances were small comfortfor countless women for whom the mere fact of womanhood can poseextraordinary risks. For them, ``Home, Sweet Home'' is a cruelillusion.   In the United States, says Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, asmany as 15 million women have been beaten, raped or suffered otherforms of physical and sexual assault, with the number rising by 1million a year.   As Hedy Nuriel, first vice chairman of the National Coalition ofDomestic Violence, put it: ``For many of us, it's safer to be out onthe streets than to be in our own homes.''   Heise, writing in World Watch magazine, says that,internationally, women tend to be targets because of their sex andthat the violence occurs ``without social remorse or protest.''   ``Societies tacitly condone this violence through their silenceor, worse yet, legitimize it through laws, customs and courtopinions that blatantly discriminate against women,'' she says.   During a parliamentary debate in Papua New Guinea on whetherwife-beating should be made illegal, one participant, Williami Wi,was quoted as saying that the practice ``is an accepted custom ...we are wasting our time debating the issue.''   In India, Heise writes, countless women have died as a byproductof the system in which a bride's parents provide gifts to the groomas part of a marriage settlement.   Murder, suicide or severe abuse is sometimes the price youngbrides pay if promised money or goods do not materialize, she says.   For a woman in Bangladesh, said Ishrat Shamin of the Universityof Dhaka, the choice is often between a violent home and none at all.   In that country, ``separated, deserted or divorced women aresocially unacceptable,'' she observes, ``and remarriage is almostimpossible.''   To remedy the problem of violence, Heise says, the most importantstep women can take is to recognize oppression and act togetheragainst it.   ``Those battered or raped need to know they are not alone andsociety needs to know the extent of women's victimization,'' shesays.   ``Violence persists in part because it is hidden. If governmentsand women's groups can expose its magnitude through surveys andbetter statistics, then ignorance will no longer be an excuse forinaction.''</TEXT></DOC>
