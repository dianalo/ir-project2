ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   After 48 witnesses and nearly 11 weeks,testimony ended in the Oliver North trial Friday with a witnessdescribing a ``pretty frantic'' North so strapped for cash in 1984that he complained of not having enough for lunch or gasoline.   But, said Mary Dix who controlled expense money at the NationalSecurity Council, all that stopped in 1985 _ a time when North hadin his office safe a huge revolving fund for expenses having to dowith the Nicaraguan Contras.   After hearing her and four other rebuttal witnesses, the judgesent jurors home for a long weekend and told them to return Tuesdayfor final arguments expected to take most of two days. He said theywould be sequestered as soon as they begin deliberations.   Mrs. Dix said North, in 1984, was after her to reimburse him fortaxi fares and other expenses quickly.   ``He would run by and his face was red and he was very upsetwith my staff if for some reason they didn't have money,'' shesaid. ``He would say he didn't have enough cash to go home or hedidn't have lunch money. He was pretty frantic that we turn them(the expense accounts) around as fast as we could because hiscredit cards were charged to the max.''   Once, she said, he ran after her in a hallway yelling ``Mary,Mary.''   Her description of North, then earning $50,000 as a Marinelieutenant colonel, was at odds with North's own testimony. He saidthat since he was a midshipman at the U.S. Naval Academy, he had afamily fund of as much as $15,000, stashed in a metal box bolted tothe floor in a closet at home.   North is charged with profiting illegally from his Iran-Contradealings, including an accusation that he diverted Contratraveler's checks to his own use. He is also accused of lying toCongress and the attorney general about his activities.   The jury, which had heard a succession of witnesses who includeda congressman, an attorney general, a national security adviser, aContra leader and a number of CIA agents in an eight-week period,also heard Friday from a used car salesman.   William Howell also contradicted a North account, in this casein connection with how North came to buy a used car in October 1985for $8,038, for cash. North said he went to the lot in Tyson'sCorner, Va., to buy a station wagon, then saw a heavier vehicle andsettled on that, paying $5,000 down and the balance four dayslater, all in cash from the box.   Howell recalled, however, that North telephoned him three times,responding to a newspaper ad for the car, a 1982 ChevroletSuburban, a heavy-duty vehicle with 51,000 miles.   ``He inquired about the vehicle, indicating he had a necessityto tow a horse trailer,'' Howell said. The oldest daughter ofNorth's four children rode horses in competitions.   To a question by assistant prosecutor David Zornow about whatNorth said about paying the balance, Howell said, ``It was myunderstanding the money was to come from the White House CreditUnion.''   Howell said North later gave him, his wife, daughter and parentsa tour of the White House when it was decorated for Christmas.   Willard Zucker, who previously testified, was brought back forfurther questioning Friday. He is an American living in Switzerlandwho set up bank accounts for Albert Hakim, a business partner ofNorth's co-defendant Richard Secord. Zucker said he was asked byHakim to sound North's wife out about helping his children withtheir education.   North had explained that Hakim had wanted to provide for hisfamily if something happened to him on his dangerous, clandestinemission to Tehran in 1986 and had told him only that Mrs. North wasto meet Hakim's lawyer.   ``I said to her I have been requested by some of our clients, Ididn't identify them, to obtain certain information from her abouther children ... for the purpose of seeing whether there was somepossibility of being some assistance with respect to theireducation,'' Zucker testified.   Also testifying Friday was Stephen E. Berry, associate counselin 1986 of the House Intelligence Committee. He said North had tolda meeting of the committee in August that year that he hadinstalled a security system at his home at his own expense.   One of the charges against North is that he accepted an illegalgratuity _ the $13,800 system, which was paid for by Secord _ andthen tried to hide that fact by backdating two letters to thecontractor.</TEXT></DOC>
