Gephardt, a Missouri congressman, accepted $337,698 incontributions from PACs, including those representing FirstRepublican Bank Fund, Prudential-Bache Securities and E.F. Hutton andamp;Co., now a part of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.   Dole, a senator from Kansas, has received $645,190 incontributions from PACs representing banking institutions, utilitycompanies and other groups, according to a report issued Tuesday byCongress Watch.   Vice President Bush has received the second-highest amount with$559,895; Rep. Jack Kemp has gotten $57,766, and the otherRepublican candidate, former television evangelist Pat Robertson,has not accepted any PAC contributions, the report said.   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. was second among the Democratswith $174,934 in PAC money, and Illinois Sen. Paul Simon was thirdwith $152,250. Jesse Jackson accepted $47,925 in PAC contributions,the report said.   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and former Colorado Sen. GaryHart have said they do not accept PAC money.   Gephardt was roundly criticized on the subject by several of hisrivals in a debate Monday night in Williamsburg, Va.   And the Dukakis campaign has prepared anti-Gephardt ads thatcommunications director Leslie Dach described this way: ``He sayshe is leading the little guy's fight, but his campaign is financedand supported by the big guys. His biggest contributors areAmerica's biggest corporations.''   Congress Watch, which issued the report, is the legislative armof Public Citizen, the liberal organization founded in 1971 byconsumer advocate Ralph Nader. The group based its report onFederal Election Commission documents from October 1987 andcampaign contributions through Jan. 31 of this year.   Monday night, Dukakis took Gephardt to task for accepting PACcontributions while ``racing around the country beating up on theestablishment.''   Gephardt said he had often voted against the policies advocatedby his contributors and ``to suggest that people have votedaccording to the wishes of people who have given them money, I justthink is out of touch with reality. I haven't done that and I knowyou haven't done that.''   But Jackson said Gephardt's contention that he ignored thewishes of his contributors was unrealistic.   ``Lobbyists would lose their jobs if they gave moneycontinuously against the interests of who they were working for,''Jackson said.   Among contributors to Gephardt's campaign were the Builders PACAssociation, $5,000; First Republican Bank Fund, $5,000;Prudential-Bache Securities, $2,500; Mercantile Bank Corp., $1,000,and E.F. Hutton, $1,500.   Election law limits each PAC to contributions of no more than$5,000 to any one candidate, in contrast to the limit forindividual contributions of $1,000.   Gore received contributions from PACs representing Coca-ColaBottling Co., $2,500; Lockheed Corp., $1,000; the Sheet MetalWorkers, $5,000, and Pacific Telesis, $1,500.   Dole's PAC contributors included American Telephone andamp; TelegraphCo., $5,000; H andamp; R Block, $1,000; Shell Oil, $5,000; Union Oil,$5,000, and Federal Express, $2,000.   According to FEC documents released last year, Dole led hisSenate colleagues with a total of $3.3 million received from PACssince he entered Congress in 1968.   Of that, about $1 million was raised from PACs for the Kansassenator's re-election campaign in 1986.   Bush accepted contributions from PACs representing Citicorp,$2,250; CSX Transportation, $1,000, and Manufacturers Hanover,$2,000.</TEXT></DOC>
