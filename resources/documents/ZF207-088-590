 &quot;Digital believes there is a healthy aftermarketto help customers dispose of their no-longer-needed equipment,&quot; said MichaelDodson, a DEC field service spokesman.andM;Leaders of the influential Digital Dealers Association (DDA) say that,although DEC may have changed its policies, the company's attitude stillleaves plenty of room for improvement.andM;&quot;Digital regards used-equipment dealers as teh enemy,&quot; said James Claypoole,who chairs DDA's Industry Standards and Ethics Committee and is president ofBoston-based Bay State Computer Group.andM;&quot;It is a shortsighted viewpoint.andP;  We're the conduit that permits [DECPresident Kenneth] Olsen's customers to dispose of old technology,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;Digital has always worked in harmony with used-equipment dealers andcustomers,&quot; DEC's Dodson said.andP;  &quot;A Digital customer is a Digital customer and[he or she] is supported like any customer through a wide range of serviceoptions.andP;  We absolutely want their business.andP;  But some users disagree thatDEC is cooperative and see the interest as competition.&quot;andM;&quot;In my opinion, we could do a lot more business if DEC were easier to dealwith,&quot; said Reg Rogers, account manager for El Camino Resources, which isbased in Northridge, Calif.andP;  DEC &quot;is too narrow-minded&quot; and &quot;is still anengineering environment,&quot; he said.andM;El Camino--which also deals in IBM equipment--said that Big Blue has apeopole-oriented philosophy, whereas DEC's philosophy remains &quot;they want tosell it,&quot; he said.andM;IBM for example, has a sales representative assigned to El Camino, but DECwill not assign the company a sales representative.andP;  &quot;IBM treats leasingcompanies as [value-added resellers],&quot; Rogers said.andP;  &quot;DEC will not.&quot;andM;Last June, the DDA requested a meeting with DEC to clarify DEC's cooperativepolicy on price discounts and to promote cooperation with DEC field servicepersonnel.andP;  (See &quot;Dealers Group Says DEC Discount Policy Misused,&quot; DigitalReview, June 6, 1988, page 113.)andM;Finally, TruceandM;After considerable debate, the DDA and DEC negotiated a maintenance agreementthat stipulates that all used equipment bought by clients of DDA members mustbe maintained by DEC.andM;DEC also agreed to establish some definitive discount policies and agreed notto sell its products below a certain price level.andM;The issue was a key one.andP;  According to the DDA's code of ethics, the sellerwarrants to the buyer that, at the time of delivery, the equipment is in goodworking condition and eligible for the manufacturer's standard maintenancecontract.andM;Used-equipment buyers are now eligible for DEC's software license transfer,said C.D.andP;  Smith, president of C.D.andP;  Smith and Associates of Houston, and DDApresident.andM;According to Smith, DEC has generally met its obligations concerning themaintenance agreement and software license transfer.andP;  But he said that DEC&quot;lacks control&quot; in enforcing the new policies in Europe, where DDA memberssell.andM;Smith said DEC's European operations have not been honoring DEC's obligationswith used-equipment dealers and their clients, he said.andP;  The result has beenslower market growth for used-equipment dealers, according to Smith.andM;DEC's &quot;corporate policy should be worldwide,&quot; Smith said.andP;  &quot;I'd like to seeit addressed by DEC.&quot;andP;  The DDA will continue to work with DEC to see thisproblem is rectified, Smith said.andM;Dealers say they are helping DEC by providing end users with an outlet fordisposing of existing equipment.andP;  Buyers can then call DEC for firm newproducts--and continue to turn over inventory--&quot;increasing opportunity foreverybody,&quot; Smith said.andM;Dodson said DEC views used equipment as an entree into new markets.andP;  &quot;Two orthree years from now, a used-equipment customer may need a new VAX.andP;  Bysupporting customers and dealers, we get market penetration now,&quot; Dodsonsaid.andM;Not all DDA members are disgruntled, however.andP;  Kate McCanna, manager ofpublic relations and advertising for Data 3 of Minneapolis, said that hercompany has found DEC to be cooperative in its field service dealings.andM;&quot;Realistically,&quot; she said, &quot;DEC is in the business to promote new products.andO;We're in the business to promote used products.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
