The group, which controls a 9.7% stake in Rospatch, said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it believes a sale, merger or leveraged buyout of Rospatch &quot;would be the most likely means for the company's shareholders to maximize the value of their investment.&quot;    The group added in the filing that it plans to contact third parties who might be interested in acquiring Rospatch on terms group members consider favorable. The group didn't specify in the filing what terms it would find acceptable.    Rospatch, of Walker, Mich., makes wood products, defense electronics products and other items. The company posted 1985 net income of $1.8 million, or $1.01 a share, on sales of $97.1 million, down from 1984 net of $2.2 million, or $1.55 a share, on sales of $74.1 million. Officials of the company weren't available for comment.    According to the filing, the group holds 238,008 Rospatch common shares for its own account and for clients. Brookehill is a brokerage firm and Moore Grossman is an investment adviser. Both are based in New York.    Rospatch shares closed yesterday at $21.25, up $1.25, in national over-the-counter trading.    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets. </TEXT></DOC>
