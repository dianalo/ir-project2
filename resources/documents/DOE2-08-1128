This report presents the techniques employedin the fallout analysis, tabulates and evaluates the radiological data,relates the deposition pattern to the meteorological situation, and pointsout inconsistencies and limitations. In addition, the 1987 pattern iscompared with the SIMON pattern published by the US Weather Bureau in1956.
