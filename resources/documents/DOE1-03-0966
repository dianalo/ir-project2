Design and construction were funded by SOLERAS,a joint effort by the United States and Saudi Arabia to further the developmentand commercialization of the solar energy. The plant consists of 18 parabolicdish solar collectors with a total reflective surface of 1,445 m/sup2/ and a thermal output of over 1 MW. Its rated output is 200 m/sup 3/per day of fresh water. The collectors heat a synthetic heat transferfluid, Syltherm 800. The heated fluid, in turn, charges a molten saltbuffer system. On demand, the molten salt is pumped from a two tank storagesystem through a steam generator, producing superheated steam. The steamis expanded through a steam engine which provides the shaft power thatdrives the compressors of the desalination system. This paper describesthe solar plant and some of the trade off studies that led to the finalconfiguration. Important trade off studies included: the choice of heattransfer fluid and the thermal storage medium. In addition, the selectionof solar collectors was an interesting exercise.</TEXT></DOC>
