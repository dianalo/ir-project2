Thirty-four percent of the 11,000 students _ 25 percent of theboys and 42 percent of the girls _ reported that they had thoughtseriously about ending their lives, and 15 percent had gone so faras to attempt potentially fatal injuries, the national Centers forDisease Control reported Thursday.   Dr. Lloyd Kolbe, director of the CDC's Division of Adolescent andSchool Health, said the suicide figures were surprising. ``We justdidn't think it would be that high,'' he said.   He said it was the first time the suicide question had been askedin the National Adolescent Student Health Survey, so researcherslacked a bench mark for comparison.</TEXT><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Scientists reported today that the next best thingto a cure for the common cold _ a way to prevent it _ may havebecome possible at last by using a kind of cellular illusion totrick the relentless virus.   Two teams, working separately, have deciphered the chemicalhitching post that about half of all cold viruses use when theylatch onto cells in the nose and infect them.   This seemingly arcane discovery may be an important key todefeating one of humanity's most universal miseries.   ``It is clearly feasible to develop a treatment based on what wehave learned,'' said Dr. Timothy A. Springer of the Center for BloodResearch in Boston.</TEXT><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Justice Department has joined a $60million lawsuit against Northrop Corp. that alleges the defensecontractor falsified tests, raising fears that many of the 1,764nuclear missiles aboard U.S. bombers may fail.   ``Northrop has delivered a guidance system for a nuclear weaponssystem that very well may not work if used. That is the bottomline,'' said attorney Rob Kilborne.   Documents released Thursday by U.S. District Court Judge DavidKenyon revealed that the federal government joined forces on Feb. 15with two ex-Northrop employees, whom Kilborne represents, in a $60million civil lawsuit brought against the aerospace concern in 1987.

Daniel L. Conrad, the liaison between North and conservativefund-raiser Carl ``Spitz'' Channell, said North made the comment inthe fall of 1985 and then told Conrad the two had to stop meeting atNorth's office.   Conrad's name appeared on a log at the Old Executive OfficeBuilding each time he visited North and ``he didn't want meetings tobe so often,'' Conrad testified Thursday.   Conrad said North told him the National Security Council recentlyhad received a letter from a congressional committee asking aboutNSC staff members' involvement in fund-raising and other activitiesfor the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. At the time, Congress had bannedU.S. aid to the Contras.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Bush administration, which has alreadyunveiled an ambitious plan to deal with the savings and loan crisis,is preparing to tackle another financial crisis, the problem ofThird World debt.
