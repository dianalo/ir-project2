If the pastoral letter is to fulfill its purpose ofguiding citizens and officials in the right direction, an effort mustbe made to apply the bishops' just-war principles of today's militarypolicies. That is the purpose of this essay. Citizens and political leaders,stimulated by the bishops' study, may well ask which military procurementpolicies they should support, which arms control initiatives and treatiesU.S. officials should approve, which weapons the United States shoulddecline to use even in the event of war, and which weapons morally sensitivesoldiers should refrain from firing, even under orders, if the governmenthas not exercised the appropriate self-restraint. In short, an effortmust be made to envision a U.S. security policy shaped in accordancewith the bishops' collective wisdom.</TEXT></DOC>
