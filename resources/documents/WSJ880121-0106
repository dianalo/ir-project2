Davis will step down as chairman and be succeeded by his cousin, A. Dano Davis, president of the company.    Robert Davis, 56 years old, said he requested the change so that he could devote more time to helping manage other Davis family entities. Davis family interests control about 38% of the stock of the huge food retailer; most of the shares are held in jointly owned corporations that also have investments in real estate, oil and gas and insurance, among other things. Robert Davis said he would spend much of his time tending those interests &quot;to assure that the Davis family's backing of Winn-Dixie remains strong.&quot;    &quot;I'm just stepping down to give myself a little more elbow room,&quot; he said.    Mr. Davis said he will assume the position of vice chairman and will &quot;remain active&quot; in company affairs. He had been chairman since 1983.    Robert and A. Dano Davis are sons of two of the chain's four founding brothers. From a single store in 1925, Winn-Dixie has grown into the largest grocery store chain in the Sun Belt with 12,052 stores. For the first quarter ended Sept. 16, it earned $15.5 million, or 38 cents a share, on sales of $2 billion.    In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Winn-Dixie closed at $38.50, down $1.25.    The successor to A. Dano Davis, 42 years old, as president will be James Kufeldt, 49, senior vice president for retail information and planning. Frank L. James, 55, executive vice president, was named executive vice president for retail planning and development. Charles H. McKellar, 50, a regional director, has been named executive vice president for operations.    Messrs. Kufeldt and McKellar also were named directors, expanding the board to 14 members.    Despite steady increases in sales, Winn-Dixie has been plagued for several years by slumping return on equity and lackluster earnings growth. Some analysts suggested that Winn-Dixie's board might have made the switch to try to reinvigorate the company, but Robert Davis dismissed that notion.    &quot;We're satisfied that we're well on the way to transforming Winn-Dixie into a price-competitive, customer-driven food retailer,&quot; he said. &quot;Stepping down was my idea.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
