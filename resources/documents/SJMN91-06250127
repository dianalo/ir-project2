Fitzgerald Marine Reserve, a slice of aquatic life on the SanMateo coast, is a fine place to wander, pretend an interest in the life of theteeming sea, and mellow out with wet feet.;   But there is another way to seeat least a part of the reserve -- see it in macrocosm, as it were. It's calledthe Moss Beach Distillery Restaurant.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Eye  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  PULL UP A CHAIR AND ENJOY MOSS BEACH DISTILLERY'SVIEW  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  ROAD TRIP  </MEMO><TEXT>     The Distillery, about half a mile south of the Marine Reserve parking lot(and reachable from the beach via a steep path that is officially closed), iswhere it is thanks to the wonders of nature.;   The site was chosen in 1928 bya restaurateur named Frank Torres. Maybe the view had something to do with it.But the convenience of bootleggers off-loading booze in the cove below therestaurant was probably more of a determining factor. (Claiming to have been abordello is de rigueur for historic roadhouses, and Moss Beach Distilleryparticipates in that proud tradition. The Prohibition-era pleasure palace wasnext door, according to the history on the back of the menu.);   To best takeadvantage of the setting, here's what you do: Park in the dirt lot overlookingwhat appears to be a statue out on the reef (more about this later). Onceinside the restaurant, ignore the dining room (nice view, so-so food) and headfor the bar. Go on through to the back door, exit and take the stairs to yourleft.;   You are now on a partly covered concrete and grass patio beneath thebar. Here there are heat lamps, deck chairs, heavy blankets and GwendolynDeWees, who will call in your appetizer order and mix you a drink. If youmanage to seem unusually awkward, as I did, she will even tuck you in. Sayhello to her dog Jenner, who tends to hog one of the heat lamps.;   The viewis splendid, especially on those evenings -- rare in these parts -- when thesunset is actually visible. Below you is a curving, barren beach, part of theMarine Reserve (and the former bootlegger's cove). In front of you is yourtable. On it, your drink. Education was never like this.;   There are manystories about the statue, now out of sight beneath the cliff line to yourleft. Bob Breen, supervising naturalist at the Fitzgerald Marine Reserve, hasheard a lot of them. Some say it was a loading dock, others a device fordragging captured whales to land. Still others believe it was an Army target,which is closer to the mark. DeWees is fond of the notion that it's a monumentto a fallen surfer.;   Actually, the statue -- which resembles a dismastedwindmill, like a &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; set -- is what the military, which builtit, calls a &quot;datum point.&quot; Col. Milton Halsey, retired from the Army and nowthe executive director of the Fort Point and Presidio Historical Association,dates it from around the time of World War I, which the United States enteredin 1917.;   &quot;What that means,&quot; he said, &quot;is, once, when the defenses of SanFrancisco, the heavy guns, were in place to protect the city from attack bysea, it was necessary to calibrate the sights of these weapons. Theyestablished a series of datum points along the coast, from that one, which isthe southern one, up to the Marin Headlands. . . .;   &quot;They took differentforms&quot; -- Montara Lighthouse, for example, is another. &quot;This is the only onethat looks like that.&quot;; DETAILS; Moss Beach Distillery is at Beach and Oceanstreets; follow the signs from Highway 1. (415) 728-5595 or (800) 675-6677.Bar opens at 4 weekdays, 2 weekends; dinner is from 5 weekdays, and from 4 onweekends.;   If you want to spend the night in the neighborhood, Karen andRick Herbert opened their lavish bed-and-breakfast, the Seal Cove Inn, earlierthis summer.
