(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The state Senate approved a bill to letStaten Island residents vote on whether to secede from New YorkCity.   The bill was introduced after the U.S. Supreme Court'sdeclaration in March that the city's powerful Board of Estimate,which rules on spending and projects, violated the principle of oneman, one vote.   Staten Island, the city's smallest borough with about 400,000residents, has an equal presence on the board as the other fourboroughs, including Brooklyn with 2.2 million residents.   ``There are 41 nations in the United Nations with less peoplethan Staten Island,'' Sen. John Marchi said after Sunday night'svote.   ``Who could be against one man, one vote, but it has toaccommodate the human condition,'' said the Staten IslandRepublican, who sponsored the bill.   The measure was approved 34-1 without debate in theRepublican-controlled Senate. It is given little chance of approvalin the Assembly, which is dominated by Democrats from the city'smore populous boroughs.</TEXT></DOC>
