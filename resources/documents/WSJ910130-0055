Last year, computer buffs bought nearly 500,000 programsto do personal returns. This year's sales could approach800,000, despite the recession, says Alan Gleicher ofChipSoft, the market leader. Its TurboTax volume is up 55% to60%. The increases come, Gleicher asserts, because morepeople are becoming comfortable with computers and are tryingto manage personal finances more carefully with them.</LP><TEXT>   Meca, which sold nearly 100,000 units of Andrew Tobias'sTaxCut last year, says its 1991 sales are running twice thatrate; but it cautiously projects about the same industryvolume as in 1990. Sales of J.K. Lasser's Your Income Taxalready have doubled last year's, Simon andamp; Schuster says. Itnotes the current Modern Maturity magazine reviews software,a sign that computers are reaching the elder generations.   Rising sales prompt the Software Publishers Association tostart compiling separate tax-software statistics, based onreports from six members.                                                                                                          THE BOX SCORE is boxes galore on the new Form W-2 wagereport for 1991.   The format of the employer's report of pay and withheldtaxes has been reshuffled, thanks to the 1990 budget act. Thepay base for Medicare tax now exceeds the base for SocialSecurity tax. So Social Security gets three boxes -- wages,tips, and tax; and Medicare gets two new ones -- wages andtips combined and tax. These and other changes &quot;could lead toreal confusion,&quot; says Mary B. Hevener, a Washington lawyer.   Also involved is free group life insurance that someconcerns give former employees. New law requires companies toreport any uncollected Social Security and Medicare taxes onthe taxable value of coverage over $50,000. Thus, if a workerretires at mid-year and for the rest of the year gets freeinsurance subject to tax that isn't withheld, Hevener says,the employer may have to make 10 entries on the W-2.                                                                                                          THE SOVIET TREATY seems stalled by a mystery issue andcooling relations.   In September, the U.S. Treasury and the Soviet Unioninitialed a draft to replace the 1973 tax treaty; but anissue that the Treasury won't disclose remains. The issue maybe whether a new Soviet tax is enough like the U.S. incometax to be credited against it. The question is whether Sovietlaw allows certain expense deductions, Washington lawyerEdward H. Lieberman says. A less sticky issue is the level ofSoviet withholding tax on joint-venture dividends.   Confusing things are new Russian Republic taxes thatconflict with the Soviet system. The Soviet Union assures theU.S. that it controls taxes. But with payments to onegovernment or both due in March, Lieberman doesn't know whatto advise clients to pay. Another Washington lawyer, StanleySmilack, says, &quot;I worry as much about this as aboutanything.&quot; Meanwhile, concern over repressive Soviet actionsmay be cooling Bush's and Congress's interest in the pact,which observers had hoped would be signed at the delayedsummit meeting.   &quot;This leaves us with a very outmoded treaty,&quot; Liebermansays.                                                                                                          THE COMBAT ZONE defined by Bush to provide tax relief forpersonnel engaged in the Persian Gulf war excludes Turkey andIsrael. New York Tax Commissioner Wetzler says the state willinclude them in its provisions. States generally are expectedto match federal tax breaks. Separately, CPAs in Pennsylvaniaand Connecticut, among others, are offering free return aidto families of troopers serving in the zone.                                                                                                          MORE FINGERS and toes are needed to figure estimated-taxpayments this year. Publisher Commerce Clearing House notesthat 1991 Form 1040-ES describes calculations for limitingthe tax on net capital gain to the new 28% maximum statutoryrate, if taxable income is high enough to reach the 31%ordinary-income bracket.                                                                                                          SOCIAL SECURITY and the IRS say they will work moreclosely to ensure that workers get accurate credit for taxpayments that determine future benefits. A big job isresolving discrepancies in employers' reports to the twoagencies. The IRS will play a larger role in that activity.   GET TOUGHER on preparers who cheat for their clients, theGAO urges the IRS.   Paid preparers do nearly 50% of personal returns, and theIRS says it is concerned about potential negligence andfraud. Yet in 1988, it assessed civil penalties against only1,150 preparers. Now, after studying a sample of 1987 audits,the General Accounting Office says the IRS often failed toinvestigate a preparer even if it had hit the client with anegligence penalty. Why? IRS agents told the GAO that the toppreparer penalty of $1,000 wasn't worth the time and effortneeded to justify assessing it.   Agents said they could realize several thousand dollarsmore by auditing a taxpayer instead. But that ignores thedeterrent value of preparer penalties, the GAO counters. Italso says auditors who asserted penalties had troubledistinguishing between &quot;intentional disregard&quot; of the law andthe more serious &quot;willful understatement&quot; of tax and appliedinconsistent penalties for similar misconduct.   The GAO urges several actions to ensure that penalties areassessed when justified. The IRS agrees with most.                                                                                                          BRIEFS: President Bush plans to name Renato Beghe, 56, aNew York partner in Morgan, Lewis andamp; Bockius, to the Tax Court. . .
