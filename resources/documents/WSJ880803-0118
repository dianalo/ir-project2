Paul Getty died in 1976, leaving the bulk of his wealth to the Getty Museum. One of the billionaire's five sons, J. Ronald, was unhappy; he felt J. Paul had reneged on a promised bequest to &quot;equalize&quot; Ronald's income from a family trust with that of other heirs. Ronald sued the museum for redress; to settle the suit, it paid him $10 million in 1980. To Ronald, the money was in lieu of a tax-free bequest. But to the IRS, it was like taxable ordinary income -- and in 1980, the top tax rate was 70%.    Ronald appealed to the Tax Court to escape tax. The decision turned on his purpose in suing the museum: Was it to recover a lost bequest or lost income? He had the burden of proof -- and the evidence was ambiguous. I can't rule on the basis of what J. Paul might have done, Judge Cohen said. Ronald didn't show he'd won the equivalent of a bequest, so the payment is taxable. But he can deduct $2 million in legal fees.    Ronald Getty's lawyers expect him to appeal the court's ruling.    A PROTESTER FINDS, to the IRS's surprise, that he can't lose 'em all.    William A. Woods II of Bremerton, Wash., got it just about all wrong in failing to file a 1983 return. The IRS hit him for tax of $7,152, plus penalties for not filing, negligence, and substantial tax understatement. He appealed to the Tax Court. But, representing himself, he offered only long-discredited protester-type arguments, mainly attacking the constitutionality of the income tax. Special Judge Pate found him liable for all the tax and penalties.    Yet Woods raised one new issue. The IRS figured the 25% understatement penalty on the total unreported tax, $7,152. Woods argued that he'd paid $3,814 in withheld wage taxes and that the law applies the penalty to the &quot;underpayment,&quot; not the &quot;understatement.&quot; The judge agreed. She applied the penalty to the unpaid balance and invalidated the regulation on which the IRS relied. That victory saved Woods from paying damages for bringing a frivolous action.    ABUSIVE SHELTERS are going, going, gone. Or are they? The GAO is fretting.    The 1982 and 1984 tax acts gave the IRS new civil penalties and other weapons to combat phony tax schemes; the 1986 act cut tax rates and erased many incentives for shelters. The IRS says the plague is waning and is looking for other jobs for its anti-shelter squads. But now a report from the General Accounting Office questions the effectiveness of the laws and of the IRS and faults the IRS for not agreeing to actions to improve the anti-shelter programs.    The GAO says financial incentives still exist for shelter promoters. It urges Congress to raise the penalty against promoters and to make it easier to prove that promoters aid and abet tax understatements. It criticizes the IRS's registration and detection programs and calls for administrative actions. But IRS Commissioner Gibbs says the 1986 act &quot;will dramatically curtail&quot; abusive shelters and that the effect should be studied before new steps are taken.    &quot;History has shown that those who want to abuse the tax system will develop new schemes,&quot; the GAO insists.    LONG GONE was an American whose foreign posting exceeded four years. And so was his chance as a 55-year-old to sell his U.S. home tax-free, says IRS private ruling 8825020. By selling the house soon after returning to it, he failed a requirement that he use it as his principal home for at least three of the five prior years.    MAINE WILL REBATE $25.4 million of a state tax windfall caused by federal tax revision, Gov. McKernan says; 285,000 taxpayers will get checks, starting late this month. He also will ask a special legislative session to rebate an additional $61 million of the state treasury's surplus.    FEDERAL AGENCIES must report to the IRS on contracts they let, under the 1986 tax act. The purpose is to help tax enforcement. Now, proposed IRS rules would limit reporting to contracts that exceed $25,000, starting Oct. 1.    WARY BANKS can report suspicious cash transfers without violating privacy.    The law requires banks and others to report cash transactions of $10,000 and up to the IRS. But banks have feared they might violate financial-privacy laws by reporting transfers of under $10,000 that smell of money laundering or other illegal activity. Recently, the comptroller of the currency sent national banks a Treasury memo to ease such fears and set guidelines based on a 1986 anti-drug-abuse law that clarified what information banks may disclose to the government.    Congressional reports say the law permits disclosure of names, addresses, Social Security and account numbers, account types and interest paid, and the nature and place of suspicious transactions. Key items not listed by Congress were occupation and the number of $100 bills involved. But the Treasury memo says that information may be used to describe the suspicious nature of a transaction -- when a &quot;student&quot; deposits nearly $10,000 in $100 bills, for example.    A pending House bill would let the Treasury set lower thresholds for required reports to the IRS.    BRIEFS: Oklahoma has ended property-tax exemptions for church-owned parsonages valued at more than $250,000. . . . The U.S. and Indonesia signed an income-tax treaty, subject to ratification by both. . . . North Carolina now allows an added $1,100 personal exemption for a taxpayer or dependent with muscular dystrophy. </TEXT></DOC>
