As it looks now, commodity exports will be worth $40 billion inthe fiscal year that will end on Sept. 30, up 12 percent from $35.3billion in the previous year. The new forecast, up $1 billion fromthe previous estimate in May, would be less than 9 percent below therecord $43.8 billion in 1981.   The department attributed much of the gain of 1988 over 1987 to``improved prospects for exports of cotton, red meats andhorticultural products'' and said larger shipments of rice, seeds,feed grains and grain products also are expected.   But all of the export value increase for 1989 over 1988 is due tohigher prices. The report said the actual volume of shipments isexpected to be 147 million metric tons, down from 148.3 million tonslast year.   The tonnage for 1989 is nearly 10 percent below the 162.3 milliontons exported in 1981.   ``Preliminary estimates for fiscal 1990 (the year beginning Oct.1) point to a decline in U.S. agricultural exports due to reducedvolume and prices for most bulk commodities,'' the report said. No1990 estimates were issued.   After rising annually for many years to 1981, exports began ageneral slide, reaching a decade low of $26.3 billion in 1986. Worldeconomic problems and competition from foreign suppliers were majorreasons.   The recovery has been accompanied by rising commodity prices anda tightening of global grain supplies, including sharply lower U.S.inventories because of last year's drought and short crops.   Shipments of grains and grain products head the 1989 list at anestimated $17 billion, up from $12.7 billion in 1988. That includedcorn, $6.5 billion, up from $4.33 billion, and wheat and flour, $6.1billion, up from 4.64 billion.   Soybean exports were valued at $4.1 billion this year, down fromabout $5 billion in 1988.   Exports of livestock and livestock products were forecast at $5.4billion, up from $4.9 billion last year; horticultural products,$4.3 billion, up from $3.82 billion.   Cotton exports were estimated at $2.2 billion, up slightly from$2.14 billion in 1988; and tobacco, $1.3 billion, about the same aslast year.</TEXT></DOC>
