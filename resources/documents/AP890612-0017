LEDERER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>REYKJAVIK, Iceland (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Iceland says it will never stop whalingand will survive an international boycott launched by theenvironmental group Greenpeace.   ``We will never give it up, come hell or high water,'' ForeignMinister Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson said in an interview. ``It wouldbe the same as to underwrite our own verdict of execution.''   Whaling is a tiny facet of the economy of this remote northAtlantic island, and the vast majority of the 247,000 Icelandersdon't even like whale meat.   But Iceland's existence depends on the sea, and the governmentwon't relinquish sovereignty over any of its natural resources.   In February 1988, Greenpeace launched a boycott of Icelandicfish, which accounts for 75 percent of the country's exports. Theanti-whaling campaign targeted three of Iceland's biggest markets:the United States, West Germany and Britain.   Ros Reeve, a Greenpeace campaigner who is in San Diego fortoday's annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission,estimated in a telephone interview that Iceland may have lost up to$50 million worth of contracts.   Hannibalsson said the boycott has forced the closure of severalfish processing and canning factories, mainly in sparsely populatednorthern Iceland, and several hundred people have lost their jobs.   Iceland says it has given up commercial whale hunting, but stillkills whales under a four-year research program approved by theWhaling Commission that allowed it to kill 78 whales in 1988.   Greenpeace contends the program is a cover for commercialwhaling, which the commission halted from 1986 to 1990 to preserveendangered stocks.   The hunt is being carried out by the commercial whaling companyand Iceland is selling whale meat to Japan, the environmentalorganization says.   Hannibalsson countered that the commission allows up to 49percent of whale meat to be exported, and the sales financed thescientific program.   ``It is our sovereign right to carry out scientific research,which is the basis for our fishing policy,'' Hannibalsson said inthe interview last week. He said researchers had counted more than70,000 whales in Iceland's 200-mile economic zone.   Ms. Reeve said the commission never intended scientific whalingto include mass killings. She accused Iceland of using the loopholeto keep its whaling fleet intact pending the commission's review ofthe moratorium in 1990.   Fisheries Minister Halldor Asgrimsson has said it is unlikelyIceland will go whaling in 1990.   Greenpeace selected Iceland for the boycott because Icelandcreated the precedent for scientific whaling, which was followed byJapan and Norway, Ms. Reeve said.   In the United States, she said, the Long John Silver seafoodchain canceled a $9 million contract, Burger King cut its buying by20 percent, and Boston banned Icelandic fish in schools andinstitutions.   Though more than 80 percent of Icelanders supported thegovernment's position in a recent poll, Greenpeace has one powerfulsupporter _ Gudrun Helgadottir, president of the Althing, Iceland'sparliament.   ``Iceland has shamed itself in environmental affairs,'' she said.``This has turned into a nationalistic cause, which is verydangerous because it prevents you from debating the issue seriouslyand rationally.''   Hanniballson said Iceland would not be deterred.   It survived a British quarantine on Icelandic cod by finding newmarkets from 1956 to 1976, when London accepted Iceland's 200-milezone.   ``We will survive this, too,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
