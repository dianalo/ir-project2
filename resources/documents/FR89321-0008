This rule amends Export Control CommodityNumber 1565A of the CCL, which controls electronic computers and ``relatedequipment.'' The effect will be to free additional equipment from controland simplify the licensing process for other computer equipment.These amendments have resulted from a review of strategic controls maintainedby the United States and certain allied countries through the CoordinatingCommittee (COCOM). Such multilateral controls restrict the availabilityof strategic items to controlled countries.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>This rule is effective March 9, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Raj Dheer, Computer Systems TechnicalCenter, Office of Technology and Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration,Telephone: (202) 377-2279.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Under ECCN 1565A, otherwise uncontrolledequipment becomes controlled if a computer of a specified capability is``incorporated'' in the equipment. A computer is ``incorporated'' if itcan feasibly be removed or used for other purposes and is essential tothe operation of the equipment. Currently, items of equipment having incorporatedcomputers with a ``total processing data rate'' not exceeding 15 millionbits per second are not subject to controls. This rule increases this levelto 28 million bits per second. This change and the change described inparagraph 3 below generally will affect personal computers up to thosebased on the 6 MHz version of the 80286 microprocessor, the 10 MHz versionof the 68000 microprocessor and comparable machines.The ``total processing data rate'' of ``digital computers'' ``incorporated''in medical systems that are likely to be approved for export to controlledcountries is raised from 43 to 54 million bits per second. This changewill increase the number of medical systems containing computers that willbe eligible for approval. This change generally will affect computers basedon the 12 MHz version of the 80286 microprocessor and comparable machines.The total processing data rate'' for ``digital computers'' eligible forshipment without regard to quantity limitations is raised from 20 to 28million bits per second. ECCN 1565A contains Advisory Notes that identifycertain computers that are likely to receive a license for export to satisfactoryend-users in controlled countries. Under Advisory Note 9, computers areexcluded from this more favorable treatment if, among other things, the``total processing data rate'' exceeds 20 million bits per second and the``cumulative processing data rate'' of all the equipment involved in onetransaction exceeds 285 million bits per second. The cumulative limitationis not triggered if the processing data rate is below the stated level.This rule increases the permissible processing data rate to 28 millionbits per second.<ITAG tagnum="84">Rulemaking Requirements</ITAG>1. This rule is consistent with Executive Orders 12291 and 12661.2. This rule involves collections of information subject to the requirementsof the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq</T3>.). These collections have been approved by the Office ofManagement and Budget under control numbers 0694-0005 and 0694-0013.3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order12612.4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), or by any other law, undersections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysishas to be or will be prepared.5. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA), as amended(50 U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), includingthose requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunityfor public comment, and a delay in effective date. Section 13(b) of theEAA does not require that this rule be published in proposed form becausethis rule implements regulatory changes based on COCOM review and is notan imposition of controls. Further, no other law requires that a noticeof proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given forthis rule.Accordingly, it is being issued in final form. However, comments from thepublic are always welcome. Comments should be submitted to Vincent Greenwald,Office of Technology and Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration,Department of Commerce, P.O. Box 273, Washington, DC 20044.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 15 CFR Part 799</ITAG>Exports, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.Accordingly, the Export Administration Regulations (15 CFR Parts 700-799)are amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 799_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
