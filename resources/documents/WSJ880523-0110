Today, his 1,000 acres of land and the sheep on it are worth less than half what they were four years ago.    &quot;I could get a notice from the creditors next week that they are going to sell me up,&quot; the farmer says morosely. &quot;But if they did that to me, they'd have to send notes out to 20,000 other farmers.&quot;    The problem grows out of the virtual elimination overnight of farm subsidies by New Zealand's Labour government in 1984. Across the Tasman Sea, Australian agriculture, too, is learning to live with less support, although the transition has been less drastic. The cutbacks Down Under represent a radical response to a conviction that farm-price supports do more harm than good to the global economy.    The subject set off heated arguments last week in Paris at the annual ministerial meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. While the OECD ministers agreed to work toward reform of global farm trading rules, the U.S. failed to persuade them to adopt a timetable for phasing out supports.    The U.S. has been pushing a sweeping proposal to end all farm supports by the year 2000. The European Community and Japan favor a more cautious approach. For the first time, the subject is part of current trade talks within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    Brian Chamberlin, president of Federated Farmers of New Zealand, contends that if &quot;common sense&quot; isn't brought into world agriculture, his country's export earnings and standard of living will continue to decline. &quot;That is why the current GATT negotiations are so vital to New Zealand,&quot; Mr. Chamberlin says.    Having already taken the cure, New Zealand and Australia want their trading partners, especially the EC, to swallow similar medicine. For both nations, the stakes are high. Agriculture accounts for a large part of export earnings -- 66% for New Zealand and close to 40% for Australia -- and the scrapping of subsidies exposes their farmers to the vicissitudes of world markets.    &quot;The farming community has gone through what I would call a very painful adjustment,&quot; says Mary Anne Thompson, an economist at the N.Z. Institute of Economic Research, an independent think tank. Farmers' incomes were cut in half in 1985-86, and their misfortunes have remained an issue.    According to government figures, gross assistance to agriculture fell to 562 million New Zealand dollars ($388 million) last year from 1.8 billion New Zealand dollars ($1.2 billion) in 1984.    Mr. Woolsey says his gross revenue plunged to 200,000 New Zealand dollars from 800,000 New Zealand dollars in the first year of liberalization. He has since laid off his three employees, leaving him and his wife to run the farm.    Surprisingly few farmers, however, have given up entirely. According to Mr. Chamberlin, there have been only about 200 bankruptcies, although government officials say 2,500 of the country's 65,000 farmers are at risk. Instead, farming families have taken up other employment -- 30% of farmers' wives now have other full-time jobs.    In Australia, meanwhile, budget assistance to farmers fell 11% in five years to 430 million Australian dollars ($330 million) in 1985-86. The subsidies are now among the lowest in the developed world, and Prime Minister Bob Hawke has pledged further cutbacks.    When it comes to farm subsidies, Australia and New Zealand have never been in the EC's league. The community expects to spend 27.5 billion European currency units ($33.7 billion) this year on the Common Agricultural Policy, a complex system of price supports, export subsidies and protective levies.    Some experts doubt the effectiveness of exerting external pressure on the EC. &quot;Domestic policies are the root cause of the trade problem&quot; of overproduction, says Andy Stoeckel, director of Australia's Centre for International Economics, an independent research body. &quot;Countries will only change their policies for domestic reasons. . . . You have to show people that it's in their own interests.&quot; Toward that end, Mr. Stoeckel estimates that the EC has lost one million manufacturing jobs by channeling so much investment into agriculture.    The tactic of cutting subsidies first and then calling on others to follow suit is also questioned. &quot;Look at New Zealand -- they have nothing left to negotiate away,&quot; Mr. Stoeckel says.    But Mr. Chamberlin, the New Zealand farmers' leader, contends New Zealand's farmers have been hurt more by the government's other economic policies than by the slashing of subsidies.    Although Mr. Woolsey, too, accepts that farm supports had to be curtailed, he thinks they should have been phased out. And he fears that any benefits from trade talks may not come soon enough. &quot;Time is running out for a lot of farmers,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
