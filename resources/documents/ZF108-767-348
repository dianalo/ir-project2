(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>IT IS ALWAYS difficult to summarize a successful conference in a writtenreport.andP;  The most important things-the interaction, the discussions spawnedby the presentations, the flow of ideas, the new inspirations-do not lendthemselves to easy summary.andM;By any measure, the first Digital World Conference was very successful.andP;  Formost of us, it was three days packed with exposure to new ideas, new productsand new insights.andP;  Author Douglas Adams expressed the theme of the conferenceweek in the opening session when he talked of the succession of criticalmasses&quot; that have been created when something (publishing, music, etc.) comestogether with the computer.andP;  What is now starting to happen, he said, is acritical mass of critical masses.&quot; Everything is coming together, and theresulting changes will be even more profound than those produced by theearlier convergences.andM;One of the consequences of this is a rapidly escalating interdependence,since we will increasingly share common digital technology and commondigitized information across industries.andP;  Publishers must understand what is(and is not) happening in high-definition television (HDTV),telecommunications, computing, entertainment, and even home consumer marketsbecause these developments will shape both the technology we have to workwith and the competitive environment in which we operate.andP;  The intention ofthe conference was to bring together people from a variety of backgrounds tosort out how the migration to a digital world is progressing and get someinsights as to how it could a each of us.andM;We covered some of the new and prototype products m our last issue (Vol.andP;  4,No.andP;  11), including Warner's Megillah, Apple's HyperCard 2.0 and the RadiusTVsystem.andP;  In this issue, we will turn to a publisher's perspective of some ofthe specific technology presentations.andP;  In the interest of space, we areomitting much of the more philosophical content.andP;  We will return to some ofthis at a later date.andM;Why digital publishing?andM;Publishing has always been much broader than putting words on paper.andP;  Theword itself derives from &quot;make public.&quot; The key elements of publication, aswe see it, are information and communication.andP;  We could be less pretentiousand define publication as something to say and a forum in which to say it,but the terms information and communication have connotations in thecomputing industry that have helped shape our view of publishing technology.andO;They are what we will be talking about in this article.andM;In ancient times, there were very limited publishing technologies; speech andmusic.andP;  The invention of writing and, later, printing allowed the publisherto speak to an audience that was remote in both space and time.andP;  Theadvantage of this was that the speaker could reach a much larger audience.andO;The disadvantage was that the speaker was restricted to a subset of humancommunication.andP;  The speaker had to make do with mere words, sacrificinggesture, tone of voice, stage setting and musical accompaniment.andP;  Print, itseems, is a communication technology with a very narrow bandwidth.andM;When it was first invented, writing was very costly.andP;  Only the most importantdocuments could cost-justify its use: financial records, military orders,bibles.andP;  Literacy was a craft skill, and a man who could read and write wouldnever lack a job.andP;  Not until the introduction of mass-produced paper did itmake sense to send all children to school.andP;  Now a nation's literacy rate is aclosely watched statistic.andM;In this century, technologies with much greater band-width-radio, televisionand movies-have been invented and exploited.andP;  Like print, they were at firstlimited to high-return uses and their exploitation was in the hands of craftspecialists.andP;  Recently, mass production has cut their cost to the point wherenearly anyone who really wants to can gain access to the technology.andP;  Thecraft skill needed to mix a sound track or edit a film is gradually beingpackaged in software, but widespread  literacy&quot; is still in the future; fewpeople outside the entertainment industry really know how to make a goodvideo.andM;You can see where we are heading.andP;  We view sound and video as publishingtechnologies.andP;  They retain the richness of direct speech-gesture, tone ofvoice, music-while preserving the advantages of a remote audience.andP;  Moreover,driven by a general confluence of the computer, entertainment and publishingindustries, these publishing technologies are rapidly migrating to thedesktop.andM;Merger of three industriesandM;One of the most significant trends in the 1990s, we think, will be theconjuncture of the computer industry, the publishing industry and theentertainment industry.andP;  Until recently, each had its own separatetechnological foundations, its own crafts and trades and its own distinctmission.andP;  But a fundamental change is taking place.andP;  The entertainment andinformation industries are eagerly borrowing the digital technology of thecomputer industry, while the computer industry is busily incorporating theaudio and video tools of the entertainment industry into its products.andP;  Thepublishing industry, which 15 years ago adopted computer technology in thecreation of its products (by using word processors and typesetters), willbegin to use computer technology in production and distribution, as well.andM;Digital revolution.andP;  What has happened is that digital storage has gottencheap enough and digital processing has gotten fast enough that it now makessense to digitize just about every kind of information.andP;  The advantages arecompelling.andM;Digital information is a grocery clerics dream:andM;* It has indefinite shelf life.andP;  All media-paper, vinyl phonograph records,acetate photographic film, video tape--degrade over time.andP;  Although digitalinformation is recorded on these perishable media, the use of redundant,error-correcting codes means that the information itself is highly resistantto corruption.andP;  As long as it is copied before its medium has become utterlyunusable, the information can live forever.andM;* It can be transported without damage.andP;  It does not particularly matter whatmedium is used to store the information, be it magnetic tape, optical discs,bar codes on paper or semiconductor memory chips.andP;  Publishers and consumerscan trade off cost, access speed, storage density and other factors withconsiderable freedom.andM;* It can be tailored to each customer.andP;  For the publisher, this means thatediting sound bites and video clips becomes relatively easy.andP;  The same tool-adesktop computer-is used for composing text, retouching still images,sequencing video frames or synchronizing sounds.andP;  For the consumer ofpublished information, it means a rich interactive medium from which toextract as much or as little information as desired.andM;In many cases, digital information is superior to the analog technology it isreplacing; witness the success of CD audio and its offspring, CD-Rom.andP;  Inother cases, it holds out a promise that has not been fulfilled yet; a casein point is ISDN telephone service, which is bogged down in regulatorysnafus.andM;What they bring to the party.andP;  Each of the three converging industries hassome expertise to contribute to the merger.andP;  The entertainment industryunderstands storytelling and the aesthetics of the medium, and it has a longtradition of putting together diverse craft specialists in a collaborativeprocess to develop large-scale projects.andP;  The consumer electronics industry,which we view as a subset of entertainment, is unsurpassed at high-volume,low-cost mass-production techniques.andP;  The computer industry understandscomplex system design, and software developers know about software marketing,distribution and user support.andP;  (We might throw the phone company in as apart of the computer industry, because it provides a communication networkthat goes everywhere, albeit with relatively low bandwidth.) The publishingindustry-that is, the information providers-have the content and the accesstechniques that give meaning to the other technologies.andM;Implications for publishers.andP;  From the invention of Ottmar Mergenthaler'sLinotype at the end of the nineteenth century, the epitome of efficienttypesetting was the line-casting machine for image recording (so to speak)and the paper tape reader/punch for editing and storage.andP;  Publishing was verymuch a craft-based industry.andP;  A Linotype operator was part machinist, partmetallurgist, part graphic artist and part linguist, and the only way to pickup all those disparate specialties was by apprenticeship.andM;In the early 1970s, publishing technology was completely revamped by theapplication of minicomputers.andP;  The linecaster fell to the CRT film recorder,which used a dedicated computer to translate bits on a floppy disk intostrokes of light.andP;  Paper tape yielded to text editing programs, and theLinotype operator's skills were supplanted by machine handamp;j and compositioncode languages.andP;  The software and hardware were custom-developed (mostly fornewspapers, which set a lot of type every day) and so were expensive.andO;Typesetters no longer needed five-year apprenticeships, but training periodsof half a year or more were not uncommon, so the operators were still prettyexpensive employees.andM;The 1980s saw the microcomputer displace the mini.andP;  The micro was cheapenough that lots of people bought them and created a mass market forsoftware.andP;  Three inventions-the graphic user interface, the laser printer andthe word processor-merged to create the desktop publishing phenomenon.andP;  Thepublishing industry was turned upside down; it has in effect become a branchof the computer industry.andM;The revolution of the  90s will be much more profound in its impact.andP;  Peoplewill never abandon print and paper, but direct electronic distribution ofdigital information will become a significant portion of the publishingbusiness.andP;  The dynamic of the mass-market entertainment industry will makehigh-bandwidth communication commonplace.andP;  Publishing (and computing ingeneral) will become a branch of the much larger electronic informationindustry.andP;  Publishers who can take advantage of this will prosper.andP;  Butrevolutions are always messy and the view from the middle is one of chaos.andM;Tools for information managementandM;If there's one thing that most managers can agree on, it's that businesseshave no shortage of information.andP;  Just the opposite--there's too muchinformation.andP;  What's missing are the tools to manage that information, keepit up to date, retrieve it when we need it and ignore it when we don't.andP;  Ourcurrent tools-hierarchical disk directories, boolean text search, file serveraccess rights and so on-just aren't up to the task they are going to becalled on to do.andM;In a small firm, a new document (anything from a memo about the next officeparty to a major contract) is created every few hours and, inevitably, one islost every six months or so.andP;  In a larger firm, there are proportionally moredocuments being created and lost; in a Fortune 500 company, a new document iscreated somewhere every few seconds-and one is lost every few minutes.andP;  Thesituation is bad enough today, when most documents are paper and mostelectronic documents are simple emulations of paper documents.andP;  It could getmuch worse when electronic compound documents and hypertext-linked documentsbecome the norm.andP;  Then we will get what Geoffrey James calls &quot;informationgridlock.&quot;andM;It turns out that people don't want information; they want knowledge orinsight on which to base decisions.andP;  They only use information to constructknowledge.andP;  Better tools for managing information would help a lot.andP;  Forexample:andM;* Library management systems, for organizing multiple versions ofdocuments--chronology, edit trail, multilanguage or application-specificversions-and for controlling access to them.andP;  We already have some of thesetools for flat documents (paper emulators) in private databases; we need toimprove them for compound documents and for distributed or public databases.andM;* Context-bascd retrieval that could structure and prioritize information.andO;The present-day content-based retrieval systems work well enough when youknow exactly what you want, and when there is a logical way to index thestored data.andP;  But they fail when there is no natural indexing scheme (how doyou alphabetize a sound bite?) and when you simply want to know more about asubject.andM;There is a lot of original thought and research taking place in these areas.andO;Perhaps the most intriguing notion is that of an &quot;agent&quot;, in the computerthat takes vague orders and returns with exactly what we need.andP;  Due toApple's assiduous promotion of its Knowledge Navigator video, people tend tothink of an agent as a little talking head with a bow tie on your computerscreen, and thus to dismiss the concept as science fiction.andM;The concept, as propounded by Max Whitby, is much more general and closer torealization.andP;  As he sees it, an agent is any tool that helps you navigatethrough complex digital information.andP;  The essential factor is that the agentknows a great deal about the structure and range of some pool of information,including the techniques of traversing hypertext linkages, queryingdatabases, downloading data and so on.andP;  The agent then selects informationbased on a theme or a point of view.andP;  A keyword search is obviously arudimentary form of this.andP;  Extending the concept to provide more powerfulspecification mechanisms and to encompass more data types (e.g., sound,video) is an active area of research.andM;Another area of research is the conventions of hypertext literacy.andP;  A largepart of high school education today is learning the conventions for accessinginformation in print: indexes, concordances, abstracts, card catalogs, and soon.andP;  What tools will be effective in accessing digital information?andM;One tool whose necessity is becoming better understood is the overview: thevisual equivalent of a table of contents, a map that is available anytime youare in danger of getting lost in hyperspace.andP;  A related tool, designed toencapsulate time-dependent information, is the micon  motion icon): athumbnail summary or highlight of an audio or video presentation.andP;  Anoverview is then an arrangement of micons and the links between them; it is apoint of view about the information.andM;There is a strong parallel here with the traditional work an author of a bookor newsletter does.andP;  He selects and arranges information in some meaningfulway that expresses his point of view-that is, his knowledge of a topic.andO;Authoring in the digital world goes beyond this to add the sequencing oftime-based material.andP;  Still, the essential aspect of authorship is a point ofview-which is what we want in our computerized &quot;agents.&quot; It makes sense forcontent experts to develop and package such agents  assuming that appropriateauthoring tools come into being) and for information users to buy them likeany other software.andM;Toward a digital telephone systemandM;The telephone system is far and away the largest data network in the world.andO;A large fraction of this network is already based on digital signals, andeach year that fraction grows larger as optical fibers and satellite linksreplace aging copper-wire cables.andP;  A lot of people have looked at the phonesystem as the natural candidate for connecting computers as well as people,and ATandamp;T has responded by proposing (and in a few places, implementing) theIntegrated Service Digital Network (ISDN),andM;The ISDN standard provides an all-digital channel that combines voice andcomputer data.andP;  The channel bandwidth is 64 kilobits per second, which can besliced up in a number of ways.andP;  For example, it could support severalindependent two-way voice circuits on a common wire.andP;  Or it could support onevoice circuit plus a computer link.andP;  Or it could be entirely assigned to thecomputer.andP;  The bandwidth allocation can be changed at any time in response towhat the user wants to do with it.andM;The technology exists and is not all that expensive.andP;  Right now, about 40% ofthe ATandamp;T central switches are capable of handling ISDN traffic and haveregulatory approval to offer the service; sometime in 1991 or 1992 theservice will be available across North America.andP;  The trunk fines betweenswitches have largely been converted to optical fibers already.andP;  ATandamp;T woulddearly love to convert the entire phone system to ISDN because it would savemoney for the phone company.andP;  Currently, the process of dialing along-distance call requires holding the full channel open across the countrywhile the call is routed and the phone is ringing; this wastes bandwidth and,worse yet, the phone company can't charge for it until the phone is answered.andO;An all-digital system would allow faster routing and would waste very littlebandwidth during call setup.andM;The last mile.andP;  The main reasons you don't have ISDN in your home and youroffice are political and economic, rather than technical.andP;  Reese jones, thefounder of Farallon Computing, calls this &quot;infrastructure inertia.&quot;andM;Although all-digital service would be much more efficient for ATandamp;Is longlines, little of the benefit accrues to local Bell operating companies.andP;  Theycarry the signal along the &quot;last mile&quot; between the central switch and thecustomer's premises.andP;  The cost of replacing the existing installed wire willbe astronomical.andP;  As old copper cables wear out, more and more local serviceis being converted to optical fiber, but at the current rate of replacementit will be twenty years before the transition is complete.andP;  ATandamp;T might liketo speed the process up by subsidizing the cost, but that is forbidden underthe terms of the judicial decree that broke up the old ATandamp;T phone empire.andM;The Baby Bell companies only profit from ISDN if they can convince customersto pay more for digital service.andP;  Yet the Baby Bells are forbidden to sellany customer-premises equipment that might make digital service useful.andP;  Thatmust be done by third parties, making the conversion that much more complexfor the customer.andM;The ISDN call-setup protocols carry billing information, including the phonenumber of the calling party.andP;  But in most areas where the phone company hasproposed to offer caller-ID service, intense political opposition hasdeveloped.andP;  People have reasons for wanting to make anonymous calls.andM;What use is it? Few homes have much need for ISDN.andP;  For just voice service,it offers the equivalent of a second phone line.andP;  You can already get most ofthe benefits of this with call waiting or a teen phone fine.andP;  The majoradvantage to most users (aside from telecommuters who want to link their homecomputers to the office net) would be ISDN's ability to carry low-gradevideo, using either low resolution or low refresh rates or both.andM;The real benefits are in the office: annotating documents with voice commentsor with video, routing computer traffic through existing wiring closets andso forth.andP;  Indeed, the principal users of ISDN now are large corporations.andO;The bulk of office communications are internal, so the lack of ISDNcommunication to remote sites is less of an obstacle.andM;The Minitel experiment.andP;  A few years ago, the French telephone monopoly trieda large-scale experiment in computer communication for consumers.andP;  It startedby distributing compact computer terminals to households in a region ofFrance surrounding Paris.andP;  It offered a range of database, conferencing andelectronic mail services and subsidized the cost of the Minitel equipment.andO;(Consumers are now charged for the terminals.) Moreover, it provided oneessential telephone service--directory assistance--only through theseterminals.andM;Minitel terminals use ordinary voice-grade phone lines, not high-bandwidthdigital circuits.andP;  Nonetheless, the Minitel system has proven moderatelysuccessful.andP;  Consumers use it all the time.andP;  However, only about 10% of theusage is for information retrieval; the rest is personal communication andconferences on every subject imaginable.andP;  In the United States, CompuServestatistics show the same general pattern.andM;Even though Minitel was the only way to obtain directory assistance, thesystem did not really achieve high usage at first.andP;  What made Minitel popularwas that people started using it as an online personals column, broadcastingrequests for anonymous romantic trysts of one sort and another.andP;  Only thendid did system gain a critical mass of users.andP;  And only after that did theother services become popular.andP;  Prospects.andP;  The Minitel experience showsseveral things.andP;  First, unless there is a service that consumers are willingto pay extra for, there is no incentive for them to install ISDN.andP;  Without adecent installed base of customers, few services will be offered.andP;  One hatesto suggest that the phone company become a party to soliciting forprostitution in order to finance a technological upgrade.andM;Some offices will install ISDN switchgear internally, and as ATandamp;T convertsits central switches, these offices may pay to convert some of theiremployees' homes to ISDN so die employees can telecommute.andM;High-definition workstationsandM;Current Pc displays  typically offering resolutions of 640 x 480 pixels) areadaptations of consumer television technology, which is one reason they arereasonably affordable.andP;  Current workstation displays are bigger and are moreexpensive, but they too are derived from consumer TV technology.andP;  One reasonthat high-definition television is so interesting to the computer industry isthat it promises to provide still-higher-resolution displays at consumerprices.andM;Unfortunately, although high-definition television is already feasible as aconsumer technology, there has been little progress toward making it acommercial reality.andP;  The obstacles are partly politics (japan, Europe and theU.S.andP;  are each proposing slightly different formats), partly economic(broadcasters would have to invest in new equipment to induce consumers tobuy new receivers) and partly technical (backward compatibility, channelbandwidth limitations).andM;The politics is fascinating, if you like that sort of thing.andP;  In our view, itboils down to a collision between the economic reality of global informationinterchange, which requires a single global standard, and the historicalreality of national sovereignty.andP;  In the U.S., the collision currentlymanifests itself in Japan-bashing.andP;  The technical obstacles and the solutionsproposed for them vary, depending on which HDTV format you are talking about,but all boil down to making the necessary signal-processing capability cheapenough to put into a consumer product.andP;  Most observers feel that theeconomies of scale achieved when HDTV becomes a massmarket commodity willtake care of the cost problem.andP;  Like the broadcasters' investment dilemma, itis the old chicken-egg problem.andM;Thus, the biggest problem appears to be choosing a standard format for thenew medium.andP;  Once that is settled, the engineers will develop technicalsolutions and the entrepreneurs will find risk capital.andP;  But there arelegitimate arguments about what display format to adopt.andP;  For backwardcompatibility, it would be easiest simply to take the number of raster linesin current broadcast standards and double it.andP;  NTSC and PAL.andP;  In NorthAmerica, the NTTSC standard specifies a 525-line frame and a 30-Hz frameupdate rate.andP;  Each frame is divided into two interlaced fields, so thateven-numbered lines are sent in one field in a sixtieth of a second, followedby a field containing the odd-numbered lines.andP;  In Europe, the PAL standardspecifies a 625-line frame and a 25-Hz frame update rate; again, each frameis divided into two interlaced fields, each sent in 1/50 of a second.andM;The choice of 60 fields per second (50 in Europe) is not arbitrary; itmatches the frequency of the AC power line, which is 60 Hz in North Americaand 50 Hz in Europe.andP;  In the early days of TV, receivers often suffered from&quot;hum bars&quot;: small amount of power-line current creeping into the signal.andP;  Inthe audio channel, this added a constant B-flat hum to the sound, and in thevideo it painted gray bars across the screen.andP;  Since a stationary bar wasless offensive than a moving one, engineers simply locked the receiver's scanrate to the power line frequency.andM;(A better cure would have been to improve the filtering in the Tv's powersupply, but that costs money.andP;  Comer cutting is the dark side ofmass-marketed consumer goods.)andM;HDTV in computing.andP;  The computer industry would benefit greatly fromhigher-resolution displays based on HDTV standards.andP;  An ordinary Pc displaythese days gives 640 x 480pixel resolution.andP;  That is, it offers a resolutionof about 300,000 pixels and a 4:3 aspect ratio.andP;  The standard engineeringworkstation's display carries more than a million pixels: 1, 1 52 x 900 or1,280 x 1,024 are common ratios.andP;  The latter format displayed on a 21&quot;monitor provides an 86-dot-per-inch image.andM;A computer display based on the HDTV format proposed by the Japanese wouldallow a 1,920 x 1,080 ratio.andP;  On a 24&quot; monitor, this would be sufficient toshow a two-page magazine spread, plus room for tool palettes and status barsoff to the sides, all at 100 dpi.andP;  The European proposal would support a2,048 x 1,152 ratio.andM;Unfortunately for the computer industry, there are several things wrong withcurrent proposals based on doubling the NTSC or PAL standards.andP;  First,interlace is bad for computer displays; it makes addressing arithmeticdifficult and interferes with scrolling and animation.andP;  Second, the Japaneseand American proposals would result in nonsquare pixels, which mightilycomplicates screen drawing algorithms.andP;  The European proposal provides squarepixels, but its 2,048 x 1,152-pixel display format would require a displayframe buffer of 2 1/4 megapixels.andP;  Unfortunately, memory chips are packed ininteger multiples of one megabit; television manufacturers are reluctant tobuy more memory than the absolute minimum.andM;The ideal format for the computer industry would be 2,048 x 1,024, whichprovides the simplest addressing arithmetic and uses integer multiples ofmegabit memory chips.andP;  This, alas, would not please the broadcasters becausethe aspect ratio is all wrong for movies, which are filmed with a 5:3 aspectratio and compose a large fraction of what goes out over the airwaves.andM;In the past, the computer industry could go its own way on display standardsbecause there was little interchange of images between workstations ofdifferent brands.andP;  However, between the computer industry's desire foraffordable high-resolution displays and the publishing industry's desire tomerge broadcast video with computer-generated displays, which display formatthe entertainment industry picks has become a matter of real concern.andM;Probable outcome.andP;  There probably is no pat solution that will accommodateall the interest groups in the current HDTV standards squabble.andP;  WilliamPratt, who follows the HDTV debate for Sun Microsystems, believes that themost likely outcome will be three international broadcast standards--one injapan, another in North America and a third in Europe.andP;  However, it ispossible that the broadcast industry will settle on a single standard forstudio production equipment; if so, the computer industry will be able topiggyback on the production standard.andP;  This will obviously cost more thanborrowing consumer-market technology, but it's better than no standard.andM;Compression.andP;  No matter what HDTV standard is picked, one fact stands out:the amount of data that must be transmitted and processed is phenomenal.andP;  Atwo-megapixel frame, digitized with 24-bit color, refreshed even 30 times persecond, requires 180 MB per second.andP;  Without some form of data compression,this would exceed the total capacity of coaxial cable just for one televisionchannel.andM;We have reported in the past on the compression algorithm developed by theJoint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG).andP;  It is based on the fact that thehuman visual system is sensitive either to fine-line details or to subtlecolor differences, but not both together.andP;  The JPEG algorithm divides animage into little tiles, and in each tile determines whether to preservedetail or color.andP;  It then throws away most of the information it deems lessimportant and encodes the remainder.andP;  The amount of compression achievabledepends on how much picture quality you are willing to give up.andP;  Experimentshave shown that 10:1 compression (which transmits an average of 2 1/2 bitsper 24-bit pixel) results in an imperceptible loss of quality when the imageis reconstructed.andP;  Compressing 30:1 yields a good-quality television image,and 90:1 compression still gives a recognizable result.andM;JPEG was developed for stiff images.andP;  In moving images, you can go furtherand take advantage of the fact that in most scenes, successive frames differonly in minor ways from previous frames.andP;  The Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG) has developed a compression scheme that uses frame predictiontechniques to obtain two- to five-fold improvements over the JPEG algorithm.andO;This would permit up to 150:1 compression with good quality.andP;  One and aquarter megabytes per second is clearly much more manageable than 180, and interms of bandwidth on cable TV, it would require only two of today'schannels.andP;  It is, of course, way too much for an ISDN telephone connection.andM;Other techniques have been developed.andP;  Intel is plugging its DVI (digitalvideo interactive) approach, which uses an extraordinary amount ofcompression to squeeze a video signal down to the 44-KB/second data rate ofan ordinary audio compact disc.andP;  Digital video interactive has some problems,however.andP;  For one thing, Intel has kept the technology proprietary.andP;  Foranother, although DVI signals can be decoded on the fly with a few cheapchips, the encoding process requires vast amounts of computing; a half-hourshow takes many hours of processing on large mainframes.andP;  Finally, manyobservers say the MPEG algorithm gives better picture quality.andP;  The MPEGalgorithm can also be carried out in real time.andM;Recent reports in Scientific American and other journals have describedresearch into the use of fractals to describe images in very compact form.andO;Computer scientists have done some experiments where a few kilobytes ofparameters to a fractal-generation program were sufficient to generate verycomplex images that would resist nearly all existing compression algorithms.andO;Mathematicians have shown that any image can be constructed to an arbitrarydegree of fidelity by using the right combination of fractals.andP;  Alas, theproblem is finding the right fractals.andP;  Current theorems only show that thefractals exist; they don't tell you how to find them.andP;  In Pratt's words,fractals are the cold fusion of image compression.andM;The HDTV workstation.andP;  Looking a little way into the future, Pratt describedwhat a workstation based on HDTV might look like.andP;  It would, of course,contain a fast, general-purpose computer.andP;  It would also have a videoframe-grabber and a 6-MB frame buffer (two million pixels of 24 bits each)for the display.andP;  To support animation or motion video in real time, it wouldneed some sort of fast display processor; if we arbitrarily assume thatanimating each pixel would on average need 100 calculations per frame and a30-frame refresh rate, we'd need a processor able to perform at 18giga-operations per second.andM;It's fairly obvious that such a computer would need vast amounts of diskstorage.andP;  We'd also want the workstation to be able to communicate with othermachines at effective rates exceeding 180 MB per second.andP;  However, as wenoted above, mass-marketed data compression chips would squeeze this datainto a few megahertz of bandwidth on coaxial or optical cables.andM;Computer imagesandM;There are times when you want an image that simply doesn't exist innature-the scenery for a science fiction movie, say.andP;  In that case, you mightcall on the computer to synthesize it, calculating what each pixel in eachframe of the image ought to be, based on rules and algorithms.andP;  There are twoseparate issues involved in doing this successfully.andM;The first is image quality, which includes issues of anti-aliasing and colorfidelity.andP;  We'll have more to say about that in a bit.) The second is imagerealism and richness.andP;  Realism comes at the price of complexity, which incomputer terms is measured by the number of polygons needed to describe aHthe solid objects in the image.andP;  Three-dimensional cAD drawings havethousands of polygons, but realistic images have millions.andP;  There is afurther complication in that each polygon must be colored or shaded.andM;The simplest shading scheme, Gouraud shading, assigns a single color to eachvertex of a polygon, then interpolates the colors across the polygon from thevalues at the vertices.andP;  A somewhat more complex (and compute-intensive)algorithm, Phong shading, directly calculates the color values at each pixelof the polygon.andP;  Phong shading looks much smoother, but both algorithms areessentially local in that only the properties of the polygon itself haveanything to do with its coloring.andM;To come closer to photographic realism, we need to take into account the factthat objects reflect light that falls on them from the environment.andP;  Thefavored approach is called ray tracing; the computer plots the paths of alllight rays that can converge at the viewpoint, following them throughmultiple reflections.andP;  The color of each pixel is then the sum of all raysthat strike it and are reflected to the viewpoint.andP;  We should allow fordiffuse surfaces, which reflect rays simultaneously in multiple directions,and for transparency, which both reflects and transmits light.andP;  We canimprove the realism still further by taking surface textures into account.andM;Access tools.andP;  Fortunately, it is not necessary to invent all these tools.andO;Pixar has developed a standard rendering language, RenderMan, and implementedit on several computers (including the Macintosh).andP;  RenderMan has operatorsfor specifying surface textures, multiple light sources, shadows and motionblur, along with libraries of sample shaders and texture maps.andM;At a higher level of abstraction is the style sheet, which provides cannedsequences and stored geometry to be reused at will.andM;State of the art.andP;  It will come as no surprise that a lot of computation isneeded to compute polygons and shade them realistically.andP;  The resultingimages look great, but take a long time to produce.andP;  Animation sequences arecreated by rendering and recording still images, one frame at a time, on filmor videotape.andM;Real-time generation of movies is out of reach today, even with die mostpowerful computing hardware.andP;  Specialized rendering workstations, such asthose offered by Silicon Graphics, are fairly expensive.andP;  However, seriousanimators (including Disney Studios) conserve funds by modeling theirsequences on desktop computers like the Commodore Amiga, doing only the finalrendering pass on the Silicon Graphics workstation.andM;Color fidelity for scanned images.andP;  Scanned (natural) color photographicimages pose problems of their own.andP;  It is not possible to reproduce colorimages accurately.andP;  The human eye has a dynamic range of roughly 1,000,000:1.andO;The best Ektachrome film has a range of 10,000:1 and can capture only 70% ofthe colors that the eye can see.andP;  Top-quality printing offers only a 300:1dynamic range and only 20% of the color spectrum, while a daily newspaper isdoing well to deliver a 60: 1 range.andM;What this gloomy assessment shows is that color fidelity is a matter ofcareful color rendering (that is, interpretation) rather than reproduction.andO;Deciding how to render color on a given output device is currently a matterof art rather than science.andP;  Color separators and printers are craftsmen whohave learned from long experience how to squeeze the best-looking color froma given image.andP;  Color electronic prepress vendors who serve this marketprovide specialized tools for those craftsmen in the form of proprietaryturnkey systems.andM;Efi Arazi, of Electronics for Imaging, Inc. (EFI), contends that good desktopcolor will never be possible until a way is found to reduce this  level ofrequired skill and to ensure portability&quot; of color images acrossheterogeneous (multivendor) devices and systems.andP;  Device-independentspecification of color is clearly essential to any open, heterogeneousapproach to color.andM;Arazi believes that there are three components to achieving usable &quot;colorportability.&quot; First is a device-independent color space, based on the workdone by the CIE in the 1930s.andP;  Another is a device database, which describesthe limitations and deviations of each scanner, printer or monitor in thesystem.andP;  Finally, it is necessary to calibrate each device against knowncolor standards at regular intervals.andP;  EFI will offer a series of productsthat package all these steps and guarantee that an image rendered on onesystem will conform as closely as the hardware permits to the same imagerendered on another system.andM;This is not terribly important for pure synthetic images, since no one knowswhat they are supposed to look like.andP;  However, when you want to mix syntheticand natural images, calibration becomes very important.andP;  People have veryrigid expectations about the color of grass, skin or the sky, and they willimmediately notice any deviations.andM;Intellectual propertyandM;The law is surely one of the fundamental &quot;technologies&quot; that is shaping thedevelopment of digital media.andP;  Without legal protection for authors andpublishers there would be scant incentive to invest in new productions.andO;Unfortunately, the law is slow to catch up with the computer industry.andM;One example of this is the status of copyright for sound recordings,television broadcasts or photographic images.andP;  In most countries, these arerecognized as copyrightable material.andP;  Most (not all) owners of sound andimage copyrights are willing to license them; aH commercial users of suchmaterial would prefer to obtain clear access rights before they start aproject.andP;  But there are many unanswered questions: What is the differencebetween quoting an image, which is legally permitted in scholarly criticismand reviews, and simply using it? Does the doctrine of &quot;fair use&quot; apply tosound bites of politicians on the evening news? Could a professor publish adisc of commercials as part of a textbook on advertising?andM;Legal precedent is of little help here; no one has yet brought such cases totrial.andP;  Industry customs are not much better.andP;  The main problem, for buyerand seller alike, is figuring out what the material is worth.andP;  There havebeen cases where the fee demanded for clip rights to a sound track wasgreater than the price for the rights to the entire track.andP;  Why? Becausethere are customary terms and prices for licensing an entire track, but noone has ever done a contract for clip rights before; the lawyers' fees fornegotiating such a contract would be greater than the value of the materialitself New institutions are needed-perhaps clearinghouses along the lines ofASCAP and BMI-to provide ways for content owners to license clip rights.andM;Content owners in the driver's seat.andP;  One thing is becoming very clear: fewof us are capable of creating top-notch original videos, or have the time tospend on it if we were.andP;  (Ted Nelson said, &quot;Scratch anyone and you'll find amovie director.&quot; More likely, we think, you'll find a movie critic, not acreative artist.) That means that those who are in the business of generatingcontent, and who have libraries of existing content, have the jump oneveryone else in bringing digital media products to market.andM;Digital products need huge amounts of content.andP;  The advantages ofcross-references and of letting you pick and choose among many pathwaysthrough the subject mean that the author must provide many pathways and manyobjects to refer to.andP;  It is apparent that there will be no shortage of demandfor rights to content.andM;Companies in the content-creation business (such as ABC News or the majorHollywood studios) have vast resources of content.andP;  They want to licensetheir material; that's how they make money.andP;  In other words, there is also noshortage of supply.andP;  What is missing-and, we think, soon to appear-is themarketplace where demand and supply can be matched.andM;Applications in education and businessandM;In discussions about applications for digital media, one area that's alwaysmentioned is education.andP;  It is clear that there is no such thing as a singleeducation market, however.andP;  There are several separate markets, depending onwho is being educated and who is paying the bill.andP;  Each has its own set ofopportunities and problems.andM;Public school.andP;  This is what most people think of when the discussion turnsto computers in education.andP;  There is no question that the use of animationand sound and all the other digital media techniques offers great advantages,particularly with young children who have not yet learned to read.andO;Experiments have shown that kids find gadgets interesting and will willinglyspend their own time learning to use computers, camcorders and the like.andO;Even unmotivated underachievers often respond well if offered access to suchtools.andM;At the Digital World conference, Helen Kelly, a teacher in the Los AngelesUnified School District, described an experiment with elementary schoolchildren.andP;  She had landed a grant to document the problems and the spinoffbenefits of placing electronic technology in schools.andP;  With the money, sheoutfitted classrooms in two kindergarten-to-fifth-grade schools, onesixth-to-eighth-grade school (junior high) and one high school.andP;  The schoolswere deliberately chosen to present an educational challenge; more than 90%of the students were ethnic Hispanics and many of them spoke little English.andM;Rather than spread the money thinly to place one computer in many classrooms,Kelly decided to put enough computers in one room so that there would be onemachine for each pair of kids.andP;  She also purchased video recorders, printersand so on.andP;  What she did not buy was educational software, thus forcing thekids to figure out what to do with the machinery for themselves.andP;  Asignificant part of the grant money was used for training the teachers in theoperation of the new gadgets.andM;Many of the results were predictable: the kids were extremely motivated tolearn and use the computers, and many of them displayed a high level ofcreativity, often to the amazement of the adults.andP;  Others were lesspredictable.andP;  For instance, it turned out that the kids had no difficulty inswitching between Macintoshes and PCs; they simply accepted the differencesin operating systems.andM;The problems were legion.andP;  The school buildings were simply not designed fordie electronic age; each classroom had one electrical outlet at each end.andP;  Itwas necessary to install dual-channel conduits (one side for power, the otherfor data cables) around the entire perimeter of each computer room, yet noneof the school district's maintenance or architectural staff had any idea ofwhat it was for or where to buy any.andP;  Perhaps the greatest obstacle was inschool district purchasing habits (&quot;the terror of the low bid) that failed totake into account how hard the equipment would be used; consumer productssimply cannot stand up to nonstop handling, but the purchasing agents couldnot understand why Kelly demanded expensive industrial equipment.andM;A more subtle problem lay in demonstrating the value of the experiment.andO;Teachers in Los Angeles, as everywhere else, are graded on how well theirstudents perform on a few &quot;high stakes&quot; standardized tests.andP;  The question hasto be asked: Is multimedia just a  way of making fancy filmstrips? By anyclassroom-based measure, Kellys students profited from the enrichment thecomputers provided; but they did not show dramatic improvements on thestandardized tests.andM;Adult self-fulfillment.andP;  Adults have long been willing to pay to learn newskills or expand their intellectual horizons.andP;  Unlike children, adults areunder no obligation to go to school, yet community colleges and freeuniversities continue to grow in popularity.andP;  Packaging of education for homeconsumption dates from the days of correspondence courses, now evolved intovideotaped classrooms.andP;  Besides providing a better educational product,interactive computer-based tools offer a packaging opportunity in that userscan take the course at home, when they feel like it and at their own pace.andM;For example, Warner New Media broke new ground with its HyperCard CD-POMexposition of Mozart's opera, The Magic Flute (see Vol.andP;  4, No.andP;  11), as didthe Voyager Company with its study of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.andO;(Incidentally, Voyager's next release will be a much more difficult musicalsubject: Stravinskys Rite of Spring.) Music on a CD is a natural subject foreducation as a consumer product.andP;  Art on a videodisc (&quot;Tour of the Louvre&quot;)is another natural.andP;  On a device like Warner New Media's Megillah (see Vol.andO;4, No.andP;  11), which can store up to eight hours of compressed video on alaserdisc, multiple interpretations of plays and ballets would be possible.andM;Business  training.andP;  There are a wealth of applications for digital mediatools in business: employee orientation, equipment repair guides that combinevideo and expert software, and so on.andP;  Video games get little respect, butinteractive business-decision simulations are a hot topic these days.andP;  Arethese applications &quot;education&quot;? Some clearly are.andP;  Others, like smart partscatalogs or online documentation, might be viewed as substitutes for formaltraining and experience.andM;Furthermore, unlike public schools, businesses have the money to spend onequipment and on authoring.andP;  The payback is usually easy to quantify;employee turnover is one of American industry's biggest headaches.andP;  IBMestimates that training costs run to $50 billion annually in the publicsector and another $50 billion a year in the private sector.andM;Going beyond the role of education and training, businesses have manyoccasions where clear, persuasive communication is needed: corporatepresentations, public information pieces, merchandising displays and so on.andO;Taking all of these factors into account, it is apparent that there is anenormous potential market for multimedia computer platforms and applicationsoftware.andP;  However, there are a number of details that have to be worked outbefore the potential is realized.andP;  Documentation.andP;  When in deep trouble, readthe instructions.andP;  Documentation, for many people, is something ignored untilneeded: it's the last thing you look at when equipment fails, the last partof the product to be developed, the least favorite part of an engineer's job.andO;It's messy stuff, you have to update it constantly, or it quickly becomesuseless.andP;  However, some companies have learned to treat the information intheir documentation as a competitive asset.andP;  Increasingly, the informationthat accompanies a product is one of its key distinguishing traits.andM;The vast majority of all documentation text created today is roduced with theassistance of computers.andP;  At some point, the textual information is digital,even if that means having it on your  favorite word processor.andP;  But in mostcases, the digital text is produced on paper.andP;  Graphics and images may bemerged  electronically, but at many firms illustrative material is stillpasted in by hand; in the latter case the only permanent record of a documentis its paper form.andM;Converting the technical documentation publishing process to all-digital formincluding distribution) can offer many advantages.andP;  Traditionally, users havelooked to electronic publishing tools to aid the production process; softwarecan help manage the revision cycle, reducing the time it takes to get thedocumentation out the door.andP;  Now, publishers are examining the benefits tothe creation and distribution aspects and weighing the long-term benefits ofgoing digital versus the costs associated with doing so.andM;Seybold writer Mark Walter pointed out that the creation process is aided byencoding the structure and content of the information itself.andP;  By describingcontent, rather than appearance, of the source material, the publisher helpsauthors and editors create publications that are tailored to an individualcustomer's requirements.andP;  For example, Boeing may supply the same aircraft toseveral airlines, each of which wants a manual that meets its requirements.andO;By storing the information digitally in a way that supports additionalprocessing, Boeing is able to produce several manuals from the same database.andO;Providing tailored documentation becomes a selling point of the productitselfandM;Walter further asserted that publishers should avoid isolating thedocumentation group from the rest of the corporation.andP;  Information containedin a company's technical documentation may also be used by marketing, salesor product planning and engineering groups.andM;He pointed out that going digital makes it possible to conceive of&quot;concurrent documentation&quot;--a process in which the authors art; constantlygiven feedback from product users, sales and marketing staff, maintenancetechnicians and others who end up with the final product.andP;  As publishersconvert from paper-based masters to the use of digital databases, they willhave to consider the manner in which their information is encoded.andP;  Walterrecommended taking an approach that is flexible with regard to presentation.andO;The more open and flexible the encoding scheme, the longer the usefulness ofthe database.andM;When it comes time to interchange your digital information with customers,there is considerable confusion as to what data format for revisabledocuments has the necessary richness and is viable in a heterogeneousenvironment.andP;  Post-Script, as we know it today, is well enough standardizedand almost universally supported, but it is oriented toward pages.andP;  Althoughit is great for final-form distribution, a PostScript document has beenstripped of all structural information that would make it reusable in otherformats.andP;  The logical alternative, according to Walter, is an application ofSGML.andP;  There is even one SGML application, HyTime, that provides a method ofdefining time-based structures that contain sound and video as well as staticinformation (operas or television broadcasts, for example).andM;Digital media is opening up new opportunities for delivery of documentationas well.andP;  Digital media make it possible to create information more rich thanpaper, such as animated assembly drawings.andP;  In some cases, digital media,such as CD-ROMS, are more cost-effective than paper.andP;  And, as noted earlier,digital information doesn't decay.andM;Along with those advantages, digital media may open up new possibilities fordocumentation that is much more accessible than it has been in the past.andO;Attenders glimpsed the future in a Renault film that helped mechanicsdiagnose car problems.andM;Making it happenandM;We said at the outset that the computer industry, the consumer electronicsindustry and the entertainment industry each have something to contribute tothe future of publishing.andP;  That docs not mean that everything will happensmoothly and automatically.andP;  In fact, there are a number of obstacles in theroad.andM;Standards.andP;  The existence of a mass market is predicated on standards; bystabilizing the performance criteria for any product, standards permit pricecompetition, remove consumers' fear of getting the wrong brand or style andassure media producers of a ready outlet for their wares.andP;  Referring to themovie industry, Marc Canter pointed out that having &quot;one size of sprocketholes' meant that the standard film player supports many competing &quot;authoringsystems,&quot; from the giant Hollywood studios down to the solitary avant gardeartists.andM;There is a negative side to any standard, though: it freezes development andinnovation.andP;  The trick, then, is to know how long to foster diversity andwhen to settle on a standard; sometimes a discussion about what the standardshould be is premature.andP;  The speakers and attenders at the Digital Worldconference weren't even sure that the ideal graphical user interface fordesktop computers has been invented yet, let alone user interfaces forediting sound and video or accessing public information by computer.andM;It seems to us that a number of standards are already settling into place.andO;SGML will have a major part in interchange of electronic manuscripts anddocumentation.andP;  CD-ROMs win have a growing role as an informationdistribution medium.andP;  Pixar's RenderMan bids fair to be the common languageof 3D rendering, just as PostScript is the common language for renderingtwo-dimensional graphics.andM;Some other technologies may or may not make it.andP;  DVI promises (but has yet todeliver) good-quality motion video and is supported by some verywell-financed firms.andP;  But by the time that technology gets to market, theremay be interactive systems that are, like Warner's Megillah, based onlaserdiscs.andP;  HDTV could become the next consumer mania, but it isfundamentally an analog medium; by the time the standards mess is sorted out,all-digital Tv may well have arrived in the market.andM;There is stiff room for innovation in many areas.andP;  One such area is thedevelopment of paradigms for handling truly large databases.andP;  For example,Dow Jones is bringing its long-standing data products (news wire services,tickertape quotes, The Wall Street Journal, etc.) into the electronic agewith a service called DowVision.andP;  Dow is providing the collection anddistribution of its information, installing its own data network that willeventually support both broadcasting and two-way interactive transactions.andO;Wisely, it has decided to take on a number of technology partners who willdevelop the customer interfaces to the data.andP;  No human can handle the fullflood of Dow jones data (let alone all the other information services) and soeach user will have to find ways to sift out desired portions.andP;  We havementioned such concepts as agents and micons; we expect that Dows partnerswill be active in developing still others.andP;  There will be scantstandardization to their efforts at first, since no one believes there isjust one right way to handle the problem.andM;Great content.andP;  It is no accident that most of the videos and animationsequences shown at the Digital World conference were experiments or works inprogress instead of marketable products.andP;  Aside from the usual Seyboldemphasis on new technology, the fact is that digital publishing is still in adevelopment phase.andP;  Not only is the hardware often jury-rigged, but there isstiff only rudimentary understanding of what kind of content will work.andM;Every new technology seems to go through three phases.andP;  First is infancy: itis feeble and unable to match existing ways of doing things; it is ridiculedand survives only through the unreasonable fanaticism of its partisans.andO;Second comes adolescence: the technology is hated and feared as itspractitioners learn to imitate the prior art, then go beyond it.andP;  Third comesmaturity: the new technology becomes the accepted way of doing things.andM;It seems clear that digital media is still in the first stage.andP;  The enablingtechnologies (particularly authoring tools) are now being built, but fewpeople know how to make effective use of them.andP;  There is a vast reservoir ofknow-how in the entertainment industry, but it has not been universalizedinto &quot;media literacy&quot; for everyman.andM;Until there are several examples of excellent, compelling digital mediaproductions, consumers and businesses will find few reasons to buy multimediasystems.andP;  From the works in progress we have seen, we fully expect suchexamples to arrive.andP;  They will become the models that other informationproducers can imitate and improve on.andP;  Authoring systems.andP;  One of the biggestchallenges in turning digital media concepts into applications with meatycontent is developing suitable content-creation tools for the desktop.andP;  Thesetools will be the sound and video equivalent of word processors, allowingusers to capture raw data, trim it, rearrange it and output it in a neatformat.andM;We think that few business users will have the time to draw originalanimations or record unique audio events for their presentations.andP;  Thosethings will be created by specialists and packaged like clip-art libraries.andO;Most authoring will be a matter of framing the basic message  in the form ofslides, narrated text, spreadsheet graphics, etc.), then selecting andsequencing existing sound bites and video clips to support that content.andO;(It's hard to write an original manuscript, but lots of people can edit anexisting draft.)andM;We have already begun to see powerful tools for selecting and sequencingtime-dependent information.andM;Opening new marketsandM;Unless someone can make money on digital media, all the content and all thestandardization in the world won't have much tangible result.andP;  It seems clearthat, to the extent that there is a &quot;multimedia industry,&quot; it has beenlimited to hackers and visionaries.andP;  This is now changing.andM;Dave Liddle, of Metaphor Computer, told conference attenders that everytechnology goes through well-defined phases of market development.andP;  First theinvention of a new medium creates a market of enthusiasts who will payhandsomely to be the first on their block to play with the new toys.andP;  Whenthe basic values of the medium are well established and there are somestandards for the user interface, the medium begins to find a larger marketas a business tool.andP;  Finally, when the functions of the medium have beensimplified to the point where they can be hidden and made automatic, themedium begins to find consumer uses.andM;Liddle noted that any of these phases may be very short, but he does notbelieve any can be skipped.andP;  He drew the conclusion that any manufacturer ofnew media must encourage the amateurs, the enthusiasts and startup companies,because they alone will find uses for the new technology outside of existingcategories.andM;Mitch Kapor, of On Technologies, raised much the same point when he notedthat manufacturers of consumer electronics equipment need to open theirarchitectures and to make technical information available to third-partydevelopers.andP;  There is no API (application programmer interface) for a VCR, helamented.andP;  In contrast, when it brought out the first Pc, IBM issuedexhaustive documentation, including circuit diagrams and source codelistings.andP;  Developers responded with software (such as Kapor's own Lotus1-2-3 spreadsheet program) that made the Pc ubiquitous.andM;The business of business is business.andP;  The first real profit opportunitiesfor multimedia computing are clearly going to be in training programs forcorporations, point of sale displays, formal presentations and other businessapplications.andP;  Businesses don't need to wait for a consumer mass market todevelop; big corporations can justify the cost of equipment and contentcreation right now.andM;First, though, companies have to ask themselves if they really want theirstaffers making lots of multimedia presentations.andP;  When desktop publishingfirst became popular, we had a plague of overdecorated interoffice memos.andP;  Alot of time was wasted making those memos.andP;  Can we expect the same kind ofcommunication overkill to happen with digital media?andM;We think that is exactly what will happen.andP;  First, people with a need topersuade others (to lead a group or obtain funding for a project) will useany tool that promises to give them an edge.andP;  Second, part of exploring theterritory is going beyond the boundaries; that's how you discover where theboundaries are and why they are there.andP;  (You haven't really mastered a toolunless you know three ways to abuse it.) We think that such learningexperiences will lead to a new digital literacy.andM;Home markets.andP;  There probably will be consumer markets for digital mediaapplications-gussied up video games, if nothing else-but they will be slowerto develop.andP;  Consumer products are very cost sensitive, but sound and videoapps are notorious hogs of MIPS, bandwidth and memo .andP;  It may a couple moreyears before chips are cheap enough that housewives can buy a multimediacomputer for less than $500.andP;  We do not doubt that it will happen, however.andM;What might these applications look like? One suggestion came from DaveRiordan of Cinemaware Corporation, who noted that video games about blastingaliens out of space have scant appeal for teenage girls.andP;  He showed aprototype of a different sort of video game, in which the user is challengedto produce her own rock video by mixing four tracks of existing raw footage.andO;The game obeys the PacMan Rule: It is easy to play (the computer synchronizesthe cuts so they always come in on the beat) but hard to play well (there istime pressure, the result is judged against ever-stricter aestheticstandards).andP;  The player can get a unique game each time she plays; she cancompete with friends or play solo; and there's a nice reward for winning: shehears the completed work and the applause at the end.andM;Whether video games are today's fairy tales or a new kind of dangerous,mind-bending drug, there will always be a business opportunity for productswith high entertainment value.andP;  Sun Microsystems' Bernard Peuto thinks thatthe core product, the one that the market is yearning for, is a &quot;sensorycomputer&quot;' that provides both content and context in one easy-to-buy box.andM;ConclusionandM;We are at the beginning of an interesting decade.andP;  Digital technology isinvading new domains and specialties at an increasing pace; and (harkeningback to Douglas Adams's theme about critical masses) the resultingcross-fertilization is providing a kind of positive feedback to the overallprocess.andP;  There is tremendous potential here and we can't help having a senseof excited wonder as we watch it unfold.andM;Interesting' is a loaded word, however.andP;  It could almost be a synonym forconfusing.andP;  At this point in the process, a sense of confusion is natural-andis shared by many observers.andM;Right now, we (along with everyone else) are still sorting out what the rightquestions are.andP;  It will be a while before there are any meaningful answers.andO;Not all the forces working in the market have shown themselves.andP;  No one knowshow the new digital media are going to affect our homes, our businesses orour lives.andM;Digital World:andM;1991 ConferenceandM;For those of you who plan ahead, the second Digital World Conference will beheld june 4-6, 1991, at the remodeled Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills,California.andP;  See you there !andP;  Digital World ProductsandM;There were an impressive number of new product introductions anddemonstrations at the Digital World Conference.andP;  Considering that wepurposefully did not plan a formal trade show in order to encourage prototypeproducts, there were nonetheless dozens of real products that embraced thedigital world theme.andP;  Apple ever,, sponsored a room in which it showcasedmore than two dozen products-all without a single salesperson (see sidebar,page 9).andM;We reported the new product highlights in last month's issue.andP;  Briefly, theyincluded the following products:andM;* The Megillah.andP;  Time-Warner has developed a videodisc entertainment enginethat is a precursor to the next generation of interactive  TV and cablesystems designed for home use.andM;* HyperCard 2.0.andP;  Apple staged a formal introduction of the first majorupgrade to its popular application-builder accompanied by a roomful ofthird-party developers.andM;* RadiusTV.andP;  Radius's latest display card adds special effects to real-timecapture of television video on Macintosh screens.andM;* Intellibook.andP;  Data General's PC-based tool for putting information on discis based on the OWL hypertext engine, and it is compatible with SGMLdatabases.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
