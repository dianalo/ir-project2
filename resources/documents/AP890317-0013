As a result of years of uncontrolled exploitation, most of Thai'smarine resources have been depleted so its huge fleet often fishesillegally in neighboring countries' waters.   Thai officials said the Cambodians later today also plan torelease 91 Thais who illegally crossed into Cambodia to mine forsapphires and rubies.   The fishermen, accompanied by several Thai legislators, returnedThursday to eastern Trat province aboard a Cambodian trawler, anofficial in the Prime Minister's office said. The official said thefishermen were arrested several months ago in southern Kompongsomprovince.   Thai officials say about 300 other Thais, mostly fishermen, arebelieved still held in Cambodian jails. Securing their release isdifficult because Thailand does not recognize the government there,but relations have improved since the January visit of CambodianPrime Minister Hun Sen to Bangkok.   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and Thailand backsguerrillas fighting the Vietnamese.</TEXT></DOC>
