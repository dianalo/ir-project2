The volatility and heavy trading left prices in ashambles, with oil analysts summing up the day's events in aword: confusion.</LP><TEXT>   Some analysts and traders admitted that after yesterday'sroller-coaster ride, with prices swinging more than $2 abarrel in West Texas Intermediate crude, they had no ideawhether oil prices now will head higher or continue on theirrecent downward trend. The U.S. benchmark crude for Maydelivery closed 38 cents higher at $18.06 a barrel.   A bearish view still seems widespread at the moment. Butseveral analysts and oil economists repeated previousprojections that the oil market should firm again by the endof the second quarter, traditionally a sluggish demandperiod.   Meantime, a typical example of yesterday's pricing meleecame out of the oil fields of Texas. There, several morerefiners reduced their posted prices for West TexasIntermediate $1 a barrel to $16.50, even as others increasedpostings 50 cents to $17.   Oil markets outside Texas were equally divided. By the endof the trading day in European spot markets, North Sea andMiddle East crudes were down as much as $1.05 a barrel. Butin U.S. futures trading, the price of West Texas Intermediatefor May delivery fell like a rock in early trading. Then itbounced back in an afternoon rally that had little moresupport than the hope that the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries was going to meet.   Senior officials of some members of OPEC confirmed thatthe oil ministers are consulting with each other by phoneover the state of the oil market, said to be deterioratingbecause of excess OPEC output.   But they again expressed doubt that there would be anymeeting of all 13 oil ministers before the regular midyearconference, which is scheduled to begin May 25, probably inGeneva. They didn't rule out an earlier meeting of theinfluential monitoring committee of eight ministers, butnoted even that would be difficult because two religiousperiods -- the Moslem Ramadan and the Christian Easter -- areat hand.   Still, midday news reports on speculation that OPEC mighthold an emergency session before May 25 to deal with the gluttriggered a rebound in prices of oil and fuels on the NewYork Mercantile Exchange. May, June and July contracts forgasoline and heating oil futures closed sharply higher --some by more than one cent a gallon -- while West TexasIntermediate for May delivery surged above thepsychologically important $18 mark.   The June crude contract also was up 38 cents a barrel fromthe Tuesday close.   Before the rebound, in the opening hour of trading, bothcrude contracts had plunged. May West Texas Intermediate fell$1.48 a barrel, possibly a record decline for such a shortperiod. Its low for the day was $16.25 a barrel.   &quot;It was the most panicked day of trading I've seen in along time,&quot; said Vahan Zanoyan, senior director ofWashington-based Petroleum Finance Co. Others likenedyesterday's pricing hysteria to that of the 50% pricecollapse in early 1986.   There are similarities with 1986. But there also are majordifferences, and most analysts and oil economists are stilllooking for a solid price recovery by summer.   &quot;It has been clear there was going to be a serious problemin the second quarter,&quot; said Humphrey Harrison, director ofenergy research at the London brokerage firm of Kitcat andamp;Aitken andamp; Co. &quot;We will see up to a further $1 {a barrel}drop,&quot; he added, &quot;and then there will be a swift and strongturnaround.&quot;   But much depends on OPEC. &quot;There isn't going to be a quickfix,&quot; said Philip L. Dodge, oil analyst with NomuraSecurities International in New York, &quot;but it looks like theclassic pattern of the past several years. Some members ofOPEC overproduce as long as they can -- and then get religiontemporarily.&quot;   Indications of OPEC's high production of some 24 millionbarrels a day -- two million above the group's ceiling --came this week in fresh reports of expanding crude-oilinventories in both Europe and the U.S.   Many traders attributed yesterday's early-morning pricecollapse, in fact, to a late Tuesday report by the AmericanPetroleum Institute that U.S. crude oil inventories hadincreased more than eight million barrels last week.Significantly, that put U.S. crude stocks 45 million barrelsabove the year-earlier level.   Even after yesterday's rebound, the near-month futuresprice of West Texas Intermediate is some $5 a barrel underthis year's peak, reached in January. If oil prices remain atthis level or go lower, economists estimated there would be apositive impact on inflation rates.   As a rule of thumb, each $1-a-barrel drop in the price ofoil should trim one-tenth of one percent off the U.S.inflation rate the first year, with some additional impact inlater years, said Joyce Yanchar, DRI/McGraw-Hill senioreconomist.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          COFFEE: May contracts fell 2.6 cents a pound to finish thesession at 95.17 cents. Analysts said Tuesday's price actionwas psychologically bearish and set the market up foryesterday's sell-off. In the Tuesday session, the marketfailed to penetrate the $1-a-pound level and then retreatedto close nearly two cents a pound under the session's high.The $1 level is considered an important technical-resistancelevel. Celeste Georgakis, a commodity specialist at CargillInvestors Services, New York, said Brazil would begin onMonday to accept registrations for the export of coffee forthe next 12 months. She said, &quot;Brazil is making a concertedeffort to reduce the role of government in the country'seconomy.&quot; She pointed out that in furthering that goal, theBrazilian Congress has approved the elimination of 22government agencies concerned with the country's products;that could have long-term bearish implications for Brazil'sexports, traders said. Yesterday's session reflected afollow-through of Tuesday's weak close, according to Ms.Georgakis. &quot;The market was definitely overbought prior tothis recent decline and was due for a setback,&quot; she said.Bernard Savaiko, senior commodity analyst at PaineWebber, NewYork, said that when the market couldn't break the $1 level,it began to encounter stop-loss orders, which quicklyexacerbated the sell-off. However, Mr. Savaiko said themarket wasn't far from a support area.                                                                                                          ORANGE JUICE: The May futures contract rose 2.55 cents tosettle at $1.9830 a pound in response to a Department ofAgriculture report. The report, released after Tuesday'sclose, estimated the Florida crop to be 103.1 million boxesbased on data for April 1. The previous month's estimate wasfor 103 million boxes. Traders were looking for an increaseof four million to five million boxes from the Marchestimate. The report also reduced the current yield estimatefrom 1.24 gallons a box to 1.21 gallons. Celeste Georgakis ofCargill Investors Services, New York, said the smallerestimate sparked a strong opening at $1.9850 a pound, withfollow-through buying sending the May contract to $2 beforeprofit-taking set in. &quot;Speculative interests have beenshorting this market for sometime looking for a collapse.With Tuesday's recent report they had no choice but to covertheir short positions,&quot; she said. She noted that tightness inquality juice is continuing, and she sees no signs of animminent price collapse. She predicts a trading range in theMay and July contracts, during the next two months, from$1.90 to $2.05. She added that she expects U.S. supplies willcontinue to be supplemented by juice from Brazil. The harveston this year's Brazil crop won't begin until May.                                                                                                          LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Prices for pork-belly futurescontracts moved up the limit, as the market rallied toencourage the industry to start putting more bellies away.Analysts say the market was spurred by the fact that thenumber of pork bellies going into cold storage in warehousesoutside of Chicago was less than expected. Last week, thesewarehouses stored 934,000 pounds of pork bellies, whiletraders were expecting between 1.5 million and 2.5 millionpounds. The previous week the warehouses had stored overthree million pounds. Hog-futures prices rose as a decliningslaughter &quot;kept hog supplies relatively tight in the lastfour to six weeks,&quot; says Tom Morgan, an analyst with SterlingResearch Corp. in Chicago. He notes that the slaughter, whichis normally higher in March and April, has declined&quot;contraseasonally,&quot; while there have been improvements indemand for pork, particularly exports. Cattle futures tradersare speculating that the rise in the nearby cattle pricereflects a tight supply of animals ready for the market and astrong cash price for cattle. &quot;This furnished the futuresmarket with support to advance to the highest price levelever paid for a live cattle future contract,&quot; says CharlesLevitt, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton, Chicago. Thecattle contract for April delivery touched a newlife-of-contract high of 80.40 cents a pound before settlingat the end of the trading session at 80.37 cents a pound.                                                                                                          COPPER: The May contract ended 1.25 cents a pound lower at$1.1810 in light trading, after reaching a high of $1.2020.The market was driven lower initially by rumors that LondonMetals Exchange stocks would be sharply higher when figuresare released on Tuesday. The London exchange will be closedtomorrow and Monday, the usual day for release of copperstocks. However, when no confirmation was forthcoming forthose rumors, the market rallied off of its lows. BettyRaptopoulos, senior metals analyst at Prudential-BacheSecurities, New York, said the market is trading on lowvolume, which makes it unusually volatile. &quot;Both sides of themarket are reluctant to hold positions overnight. Traderswith even small profits take them quickly,&quot; she said.</TEXT></DOC>
