A comparative evaluation ofmodern heating systems proves their environmental effects to be in proportionto their energy consumption. The paper investigates into several recentdivergent studies by or on behalf of the electric power industry. Thedivergencies are pointed out as being the result of unsuitable or vagueparameters. There are but two tenable options meeting the requirementsof environmentally compatible energy supplies: thermal insulation andextended cogeneration-based district heating networks or the constructionof cogeneration plants and unit-type power plants, respectively.</TEXT></DOC>
