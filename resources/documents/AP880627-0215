The defendants who won national attention in the Chicago Seventrial are middle-aged and grayer now, one the author of a barbecuecookbook, another a professional party-giver; many are fathers andhusbands.   But most remain committed to a watered-down brand of theactivism that made them household names 20 years ago.   ``A lot of people tell me I'm selling out, because I wrote acookbook,'' says former Black Panther leader Bobby Seale, 51, whose``Barbecuing with Bobby'' was recently published.   ``I say, `Why do you want to pigeonhole me?''' Seale says. ``Istill believe in revolving political and economic power back to thehands of the people.''   Seale and seven others were charged with conspiracy to inciteviolence in August 1968 at the Democratic National Convention inChicago.   The 4{-month theatrics featured wild-haired defendants whoseantics included wearing judicial robes to court, taking them offand stomping on them; and a 74-year-old judge who refused to allowSeale his own attorney and ordered him bound and gagged in thecourtroom when he protested.   ``I think it certainly was a microcosm of the times,'' formerdefendant John Froines says, ``but it was also theater, so it wasan exaggerated statement of the times as well.   ``When Abbie Hoffman said that the judge came right out ofcentral casting, it was true. Instead of them picking a liberaljudge who was very restrained, they picked a very harsh, prejudicedjurist who in a sense kind of reflected the kind of oppression thatpeople were ... talking about as being the nature of America at thetime.''   The case opened in September 1969 and became known as theChicago Seven trial when U.S. District Judge Julius Hoffman severedSeale from the others, convicted him of contempt of court andsentenced him to four years in prison.   Five of the other seven defendants _ Rennie Davis, DavidDellinger, Tom Hayden, Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin _ also werecharged with crossing state lines with intent to riot and werefound guilty in February 1970.   Froines and Lee Weiner were acquitted. None of the defendantswas convicted of the conspiracy charge.   The five convictions and Seale's contempt citation later wereoverturned by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, citing errorsby Judge Hoffman and criticizing his courtroom demeanor.   The seven defendants and their attorneys also were cited forcontempt of court nearly 200 times, but all but 15 of the citationswere dismissed.   In a 1982 interview, a year before his death at age 87, JudgeHoffman said the defendants had made a mockery of the nation'shighest trial court.   Most have no regrets about their behavior during the trial.   ``I was standing up for the Sixth Amendment of theConstitution,'' Seale says, ``that every citizen has the right tohave legal counsel of his choice.   ``I never disrupted the courtroom unless my name was mentioned.`But judge,' I'd say, `you're a racist facist dog, you denied me myconstitutional rights.'''   Seale, the father of three, now works in minority recruitment atTemple University in Philadelphia, where he is doing graduate workin political science and African-American Studies.   He also works in a program aimed at getting students intocommunity service and social action.   ``I've refined my perspective a lot,'' says Seale. ``I stoppedadvocating overthrowing the government when the government stoppedtrying to overthrow our organization.''   He plans to use proceeds from his cookbook to fund scholarshipsfor minority college students.   Former Yippie leader Abbie Hoffman, one of the brashest of thedefendants during the trial, remains one of the most politicallyinvolved.   ``I'm an American dissident,'' says Hoffman, now 51 and thefather of three.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
