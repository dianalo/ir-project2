(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The former top aide to PTL founder JimBakker pleaded guilty to fraud and conspiracy and agreed to testifyagainst the evangelist. Bakker's attorney said the deal was suspectbecause the aide had sold his soul.   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter on Tuesday also refused todelay Bakker's trial, turning down complaints from defenseattorneys' about pretrial publicity.   ``Whether this case is tried in Charlotte, North Carolina, orOttumwa, Iowa, two years from now, there is going to be pretrialpublicity. It is one of the prices that we all must pay for a freepress,'' Potter said.   Jury selection is scheduled to begin Aug. 21 with openingarguments a week later.   Richard Dortch, former executive vice president of PTL, pleadedguilty to one count of mail fraud, one of wire fraud by telephone,one of wire fraud by television and one of conspiracy, according toone of his attorneys, Mark Calloway.   ``Beyond that, we have no comment,'' Calloway said.   A plea agreement calls for Dortch to cooperate with the U.S.Attorney's office and the Justice Department in ``whatever form''requested, including ``sworn testimony in court and documentarymaterials.''   ``Richard Dortch will become the key witness against JimBakker,'' said Washington lawyer Ben Cotten, who representsconvicted former PTL aides David and James Taggart.   ``Having pleaded to conspiracy _ with Jim Bakker being thealleged co-conspirator _ it will be very difficult for Bakker toconvince the jury that at least on the charge of conspiracy he'sinnocent,'' Cotten said.   He also said the Taggarts would consider testifying againstBakker.   George T. Davis, Bakker's attorney, said he was not surprised bythe plea agreement and said Dortch's testimony has ``got to havesome effect.''   ``These kind of deals are somewhat suspect from the very natureof the animal because it is not uncommon for people to sell theirsouls if necessary to save their bodies,'' Davis said.   Under the agreement, Dortch could face a maximum sentence of 10years in prison and a $500,000 fine. Prosecutors agreed to ask thepresiding judge at sentencing to dismiss the remaining 20 chargesagainst Dortch.   The agreement also specifies that Dortch could be asked to makerestitution.   Dortch had tried unsuccessfully to have his trial separated fromBakker. The two men were charged in a 24-count indictment withdiverting more than $4 million in PTL money to their own benefit.   A federal grand jury indicted them on eight counts each of mailfraud, 15 counts of wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit mail andwire fraud. Bakker could face 120 years in prison and more than $5million in fines on the charges.   The case stemmed from a 16-month investigation into thetelevangelism empire under Bakker's leadership. The grand juryheard from more than 100 witnesses, reviewed thousands of documentsand watched tapes of old ``PTL Club'' shows.   Tuesday's agreement came on the heels of the July 25 tax evasionconvictions of the Taggarts.   David Taggart, who was Bakker's personal aide, and JamesTaggart, his former interior designer, are scheduled to besentenced on Aug. 25 by Judge Potter. They each face 25 years inprison and more than $1 million in fines.</TEXT></DOC>
