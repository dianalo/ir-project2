First, contrary to your statement, the solicitor general's brief in the Lutheran Church case clearly supported the principal proposition in that case that property owners are entitled to compensation for losses incurred between the time they are first subjected to regulation and the time such a regulation is finally declared invalid in a court of law -- the so-called interim damages or temporary taking issue. What our brief rejected was the notion that the Fifth and 14th Amendments, of their own force, provide a key to the public treasury, rather than requiring enabling legislation, as section five of the 14th Amendment seems to assume. We also pointed out that such enabling legislation is present in both the Tucker Act and Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act, so that the way to compensation for these injuries is wide open.    The Journal compounded its error by wondering what the solicitor general would do in two other takings cases before the court. In fact in the first of those, the Nollan v. California Coastal Commission case, a brief thought to be generally supportive of the property owners (at least judging from critical comments of some regulators and conservationists) was filed with the court several months ago.
