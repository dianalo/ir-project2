The government reported signs that angry citizens were stormingarmy installations, and military leaders pledged to repel anyattempts to seize weapons and munitions.   Manfred Gerlach, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party,replaced Egon Krenz as interim president, the first time anon-Communist had become president since East Germany's founding in1949. Gerlach's party recently broke off its long alliance with theCommunists after weeks of spearheading reforms.   The Communists advanced their emergency session one week toFriday to overhaul the party's structure.   Shedding such ``Stalinist'' operations as the Central Committeeand ruling Politburo is one possibility. Breaking up the party isanother.   In seven weeks, the country has faced a virtual revolution thatfirst ousted a hard-line leadership and then threw out seniorCommunist Party chiefs. A 25-member committee of Communists nowruns the nation.   The National Defense Council, in charge of the armed forces,quit on Wednesday, less than 24 hours after the leadership of theonce-dreaded secret police quit.   The official ADN news agency reported late Wednesday the suicideof an official caught two days earlier trying to leave a governmentbuilding with two suitcases stuffed with East German and WestGerman money.   ADN did not give his name, but said he was connected to the caseof fugitive Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski, the former top EastGerman foreign trade official accused of running a weapons-sellingring.   Early Thursday, West Berlin police spokesman Helmut Hinzannounced Schalck-Golodkowski was in a West Berlin prison after aninternational manhunt. ADN said he had turned himself in toauthorities late Wednesday but did not elaborate.   West Germany's ZDF television network reportedSchalck-Golodkowski planned to pay back $31 million to the EastGerman government from Swiss bank accounts. He is suspected ofhaving smuggled several times that amount from the country,according to reports on East Germany's state television.   Manfred Seidel, the No. 2 official in that scandal-plaguedoffice, was arrested on suspicion of having smuggled $110 millionout of the country.   The Christian Democrats, a small party that recently broke withthe Communists, said growing financial scandals were making EastGermany look like a ``banana republic.''   The government announced a partial amnesty Wednesday, followinghunger strikes spreading to penal institutions nationwide. Itapplies to those sentenced to three years or less and excludesprisoners convicted of ``rowdiness,'' a term once applied topro-democracy demonstrators but also sometimes used for moreserious offenders.   The reform movement exploded here after hard-liner ErichHonecker was ousted following 18 years as Communist Party chief.Since then, a popular uprising and a flood of refugees to the Westforced the government to open East Germany's borders and the BerlinWall to let citizens travel freely.   East Germans also have been promised open elections, but thecountry's overall direction remains unclear.   Pro-democracy opposition groups so far lack the coordination tofill the power vaccum left by the Communists' hasty retreat.   For days, reports surfaced of furious citizens barging intosecret police offices, including storming one building in thesouthern city of Gera on Wednesday.   A citizens committee pressing for reforms in Leipzig occupiedregional state security headquarters there on Monday, and an ADNreport suggested the activists still controlled the building.   The assaults were meant to stop destruction of documents neededin prosecuting former Communist officials.   An investigative commission recommended criminal charges againstformer secret police boss Erich Mielke, 81, for police attacksagainst demonstrators in October that touched off the revolutionarychanges.   The government, headed by reformist Premier Hans Modrow, saidlate Wednesday ``indications'' emerged that people were stormingarmy installations.   No details were given, but the government appealed for ``calmand restraint.''   The National People's Army leadership issued its own statement,addressed to both soldiers and citizens, saying: ``Such intrusionscould cause danger for the security of the German DemocraticRepublic.   ``Illegal entry to weapons, munitions and fuel will be blocked.''   Military leaders expressed ``concern for securing peace'' andpledged to work with Soviet and Warsaw Pact forces to secure peacein Central Europe.   ``Only together can we preserve the sovereignty of the GermanDemocratic Republic and protect our country from anarchy andchaos,'' they said.   The government's appeal for calm was the top item on EastGermany's main TV news program, which said Lutheran Church leadersjoined the call.   The program said ``the church has information making itincreasingly concerned about calls for revenge ... that the searchfor the guilty has frightened many people.''   In resigning, Krenz warned of ``anti-socialistic forces''filling the nation and called for a joint effort to repel them.   ``In this hour of greatest danger all those who love thiscountry must stand together out of patriotic duty.''   Krenz quit as Communist Party chief on Sunday.   Opposition leaders and members of his own party said he was tootainted by scandals of the Honecker era to guide the nation out ofits economic and political crisis.   Gerlach, looking somber, announced his appointment on TV, sayinghe was ``not glad'' about taking on the duties.   He will serve as president until Parliament picks a permanentreplacement. Speculation grew that another non-Communist would takeover permanently, although Gerlach ruled himself out.   The presidency is a largely ceremonial but highly visible post.The president routinely represents the country on foreign trips.</TEXT></DOC>
