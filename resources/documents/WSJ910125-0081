Bacon   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>01/25/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A2</SO><IN>BANKS (BNK)</IN><GV>TREASURY DEPARTMENT (TRE)</GV><LP>   WASHINGTON -- The Comptroller of the Currency plans tosuggest new bank disclosure guidelines designed to providemore information about nonperforming loans and to ease someof the pain banks are facing on Wall Street.   The new guidance will encourage banks to divide theirnonperforming loans and other troubled assets, such asforeclosed property, into several categories, highlightingborrowers who are still making payments even though they haveproblems. Now banks are required to lump together all loanson which they don't anticipate full payment of interest orprincipal, without showing what share of the shaky loans arestill generating cash.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We felt that banks should try to tell the reader offinancial statements that there are varying degrees ofproblems,&quot; said Zane Blackburn, the chief accountant at thecomptroller's office, which regulates 4,200 federallychartered banks. &quot;Most banks thought it would have a verypositive impact.&quot;   Regulators worry that the lack of detail has ledsecurities analysts to be too gloomy about the financialcondition of some banks. This has helped drive down theprices of bank stocks, made it more difficult for banks toattract capital, produced a general sense of nervousnessabout the stability of the banking system and contributed toa credit crunch in some areas of the country.   The disclosure change won't boost bank earnings ordirectly ease the credit crunch. However, the comptroller'soffice is considering another accounting change that wouldmake it easier for some banks to write down portions of badloans and perhaps to show higher profits. But the newdisclosure guidelines might damp some of the pessimism amonganalysts and investors about the condition of some banks.   Under the guidelines, banks will be able to break theirproblem loans into two major categories -- those that arecontractually past due and those that are contractuallycurrent but on which the full payment of principal is indoubt.   The treatment of this second category, known as&quot;performing-nonperforming loans,&quot; has generated frictionbetween regulators and banks. Banks, particularly in theNortheast, have complained that bank examiners, worried thatworsening economic conditions will make full payment of loansimpossible, have forced them to classify some credits asnonperforming even though the borrower is continuing to payinterest on schedule. Now banks will be encouraged to displaythese loans separately on their financial statements.   Loans on which the borrower has fallen behind on paymentof interest or principal will be divided into three groups.Tier 1, called substantial performance, will include loans onwhich the bank is receiving periodic payments equal to 85% ofcontractual interest and principal. Tier 2 loans will includethose on which the bank expects more limited performance butis receiving at least some interest. Tier 3 would be loansthat aren't providing any income.   &quot;I think that analysts right now are pretty hard onbanks,&quot; said Susan Krause, senior deputy comptroller forpolicy. &quot;I'm hopeful that our suggested disclosure may offersome relief here.&quot;   Eric Hemel, a bank analyst at First Boston Corp.,applauded the change. &quot;More disclosure is always better thanless, from an investor's perspective,&quot; said. But he warnedthat the new information &quot;will be good for some banks and badfor others,&quot; depending on how the loans are classified andwhether the volume of loans in Tier 1 grows faster than thosein Tier 3 from quarter to quarter. Tracking movement from onecategory to another, &quot;would clearly provide us with moretools to evaluate credit quality and the integrity of abank's accounting systems,&quot; he said.   The disclosure guidelines, which the comptroller plans toissue within days, emerged during the consideration of a moresignificant bank accounting change that is still under study.The comptroller's office is trying to draft rules that wouldmake it easier for banks to write down portions of loans andcontinue to book interest on the remaining part of the loanas income. The practice, called loan-splitting, would allowsome banks to report lower amounts of nonperforming loans andhigher profits.   But the prospective change raises a number of accountingand bureaucratic issues, and the comptroller probably willask for public comment before adopting a new rule. Thisprocess could take months. While studying the loan-splittingidea, officials in the comptroller's office decided that thedisclosure change would be a faster way to help some banks.To get the change out quickly, the office, which has beencharged with being too harsh on banks, decided to make theguidelines voluntary in order to avoid a lengthy commentperiod.   Mr. Blackburn said some banks may be able to use the newformat for the their fourth quarter 1990 results but that itwould take time for most banks to rearrange their reportingto take advantage of the change.</TEXT></DOC>
