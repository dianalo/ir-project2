A 3:1 ratio of corona dischargeto lightning energy similar to that of the earth is applied to Jupiter.Depending on the lightning energy available on Jupiter and the eddy diffusioncoefficients in the synthesis region, HCN column densities generatedby corona discharge could account for about 10 percent of the HCN observed.32 references.</TEXT></DOC>
