From foreign trade issues to budget planning, the two formerrivals are finding their new partnership uncomfortable.   The Finnish government is run by consensus and state welfare isuniversally embraced. As a result, issues are low-keyed and changesare incremental, though rhetoric can be heated. Foreign policydirection is the responsibility of the president _ currently MaunoKoivist _ who is elected separately from parliament members.   The government formed in May 1987 combined the socialisticSocial Democratic Party with the Conservative Party, a moderatemarket-oriented group. The two are ideological opposites andclashes seemed inevitable from the outset.   The latest tension was triggered by a secret government decisionto allow a Finnish company to buy enriched copper from themultinational La Escondida concern of Chile, which has a militarygovernment.   Although Social Democratic Cabinet ministers had concurred inthe decision, their defense of the government was lukewarm whenword of the deal leaked out and was criticized in a petition by 70prominent Social Democrats.   The powerful Transport Workers' Union said it will refuse tohandle deliveries from Chile. The Central Trade Union Organization,also controlled by the Social Democrats, said it would campaign fora global boycott ``until democracy returns to Chile.''   Trade and Industry Minister Ilkka Suominen, the Conservativeparty chairman charged that the Social Democrats had ``distancedthemselves from the government'' and did not ``give sufficientsupport to government programs.''   In response, the Social Democratic chairman, Pertti Paasio,assailed the government's secrecy in the matter.   ``It was the wrong way to handle the La Escondida deal,especially as the decision forbade government ministers to talk toother leading politicians about the matter,'' Paasio told TheAssociated Press.   The coalition has given the Conservatives a significant role ingovernment for the first time since World War II. They had servedbriefly and in minor posts only twice since the war.   The Social Democrats dominated postwar politics in alliance withthe Center Party and its leader, Urho Kekkonen, who was presidentfor 25 years until he resigned in 1981 because of ill health. Hedied Aug. 31, 1986.   Kekkonen, who maintained friendly ties to Moscow, locked theConservatives out of power in deference to Soviet leaders whoobjected to the party's hardline anti-Communist position and whofeared it might lead Finland away from its neutral foreign policy.   Before the 1987 election, then-Prime Minister Kalevi Sorsa, aSocial Democrat, said cooperation with the Conservatives was``totally out of the question.''   In the vote for the 200-member parliament, the Social Democratsremained Finland's largest party with 56 seats, but theConservatives made sizeable gains by winning 53.   A Conservative, Harri Holkeri, was named prime minister andSorsa became foreign minister.   No longer outcasts at home, the Conservatives, it seems, alsohave become acceptable to Moscow. They recently received theirfirst official invitation to the Soviet Union, and Suominen willlead a delegation to Moscow in the autumn.   The real test for the left-right coalition will be over the 1989budget and a tax reform proposal aimed at trimming income tax andpublic spending. The Social Democrats oppose slashing the moneyunderwriting state welfare in the budget, which must go toparliament in early September.   At a party conference in mid-August, the Conservatives vowed tocut the maximum marginal tax rate to 40 percent at most, from thecurrent 51 percent on the top tax brackets. By Scandinavianstandards, where the top rate can be 75 percent, Finnish taxes aremoderate.   The Social Democrats, while agreeing to some reforms, stressthat any changes should favor the poorer sectors of society.   Housing, including the financing of sorely needed rentalapartments, is another bone of contention between the two partners.   Suominen has suggested selling state-owned company shares, anidea that he said is ``not a problem for us Conservatives, butmight cause ideological headaches within the other governmentparty.''   Whether these strains will mean an early end for the coalitionis still unclear, but the political mood appears to be one ofwait-and-see.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Tue AMs, Aug. 30</NOTE></DOC>
