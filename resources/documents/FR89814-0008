Telephone: (202) 382-7647.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On June 8, 1989, Giant Industries Inc.(``Giant'') submitted a petition for modification of the gasoline volatilityregulations promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA''or ``the Agency'') on March 22, 1989. 54 FR 11868. Specifically, Giant'spetition asks the Agency to revise the RVP standard for northern New Mexico(i.e., the area north of 34anddegrees; latitude) for the month of Augustfrom 9.0 psi to 9.5 psi. Giant argued that EPA's action in promulgatinga 9.0 psi standard for this month was inconsistent with its treatment ofother areas for which voluntary RVP standards established by the AmericanSociety for Testing and Materials (ASTM) allow the use of both Class Aand Class B RVP fuels during a month. Giant's petition states that whileEPA's proposed volatility regulations would have required all such ``dual-classification''areas to meet the more stringent RVP standard, in the final rule EPA ``fine-tuned''its classifications so that such areas without ozone nonattainment problemswould generally be required to meet the less stringent standard while thosewith ozone problems would be subject to the more stringent standard. NorthernNew Mexico, Giant claims, is the sole exception to this classificationscheme, in that although ASTM allows both Class A and Class B fuel to besold there in August and the area does not contain any ozone nonattainmentareas, EPA's regulations impose the Class A RVP standard (9.0 psi) ratherthan the Class B standard (9.5 psi). Giant specifically notes that adjacenttopographically and geographically comparable areas (Colorado, Utah andsouthern Nevada) that share northern New Mexico's fuel distribution areahave been treated differently in this respect. Giant asserts that thisinconsistency places it in a competitive disadvantage relative to othersin the refining industry in terms of compliance with EPA's gasoline RVPspecifications. The company also asserts that the costs of compliance arelarge for a small refiner such as Giant.EPA has reviewed Giant's petition and has found that revision of the Auguststandard is appropriate. Under the Agency's most recent analysis of ambientair quality data, no area in northern New Mexico is classified as a nonattainmentarea for ozone. Furthermore, a review of RVP standards adopted in the finalrule for months in which the ASTM standards allow use of both Class A andClass B gasoline indicates that the Agency promulgated its Class B standard(9.5 psi) for all such months except for August in northern New Mexico.Therefore, the Agency has determined that it is appropriate to grant Giant'spetition and to revise the August standard for northern New Mexico from9.0 psi to 9.5 psi.The Agency has determined that this action is not a ``major'' rule as definedin Executive Order (E.O.) 12291. Therefore, a regulatory impact analysishas not been prepared. This regulation was submitted to the Office of Managementand Budget (OMB) for review under E.O. 12291. Any written comments fromOMB any EPA responses to such comments have been placed in the rulemakingdocket.Under section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605, I certifythat the regulatory revision promulgated in this notice will not have asignificant adverse impact on a substantial number of small entities. Theregulatory revision is, in fact, being made in response to the requestof a small-sized regional refiner, and it is expected to result in monetarysavings and other benefits to the requestor and similarly situated smallentities. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis has not been prepared.This rulemaking does not include any new information collection requirements.Information collection requirements in the regulations promulgated on March22, 1989, were approved by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C.3501 et seq., and have been assigned OMB control number 2060-0178.The Agency finds that there is ``good cause'' under the AdministrativeProcedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553 (b) and (d), to promulgate this rule withoutprior notice and public comment and to make this rule effective immediately.``Good cause'' exists because it is impracticable to provide for noticeand comment, and to establish an effective date at least 30 days afterpublication, prior to the August 1989 period for which the regulatory revisionhas been requested. Furthermore, because this action establishes a lessstringent RVP standard for northern New Mexico in August than the currentregulatory standard and therefore ``relieves a restriction,'' ``good cause''exists within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 553(d).Authority for the action promulgated in this notice is granted to EPA bysections 114, 211, and 301 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7414, 7545,and 7601).Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial reviewof an action of the Administrator promulgating a control or prohibitionunder section 211 of the Act may be filed only in the United States Courtof Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Petitions for judicialreview of this action must be filed in that court on or before October13, 1989. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforceits requirements.
