Becor said that Beco Holdings Inc., a company formed by ICM Industries Inc., a Chicago-based private company, and Bear Stearns Cos., New York, proposed to acquire each Becor share for $10.75 in cash, $4.25 in debentures and a warrant to purchase one share of Becor common. The transaction would permit Becor shareholders to acquire 20% of Beco Holdings. Becor has about 16.5 million common shares outstanding.    Lynch said it revised its proposal by offering a choice of $16.50 each in cash for up to 50% of Becor's shares outstanding or $27.25 face value of debentures in the surviving company plus one share of the surviving concern, which will represent about one-third of the equity outstanding.    Under the new proposal, Lynch would acquire the remaining two-thirds of the equity in the surviving concern. Lynch said that after two years, Becor management could buy another one-third of the equity from Lynch, a Fairfield, N.J.-based packaging and manufacturing concern. Lynch said the rest of the offer is substantially the same as a June 2 proposal, which was valued at about $255 million in cash, debt and stock.    The value of the new Lynch offer couldn't immediately be determined.    In February, Becor Western agreed to a management-led leveraged buyout valued at $238.1 million. Completion of the transaction has been held up as other concerns have bid for the company.    Last Friday, Davis Mining andamp; Manufacturing Inc., a Coeburn, Va., coal mining and explosives company, revised an earlier proposal for Becor.    Becor, which makes aerospace, mining and offshore oil gear, said the Beco offer and amended Davis Mining offer were being reviewed by the company and its financial advisers.    Becor shares closed yesterday at $14.875, off 12.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    In a leveraged buyout, a group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets. </TEXT></DOC>
