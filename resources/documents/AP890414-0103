The convoy of up to 100 trucks and tanks pushed down the SalangHighway running south from the Soviet border to the capital. Thestrategic road, 260 miles long, has been closed for a week byMoslem insurgents.   The guerrillas are hoping to starve the capital until itsurrenders.   As the convoy moved down the highway, soldiers fired from tanksand machine gun posts into the surrounding mountains where theinsurgents are hiding.   The firing continued for nearly two hours, with thick blacksmoke billowing from the hills about six to 10 miles away.Helicopter gunships provided protection for the convoy. Severaltrucks appeared to have been damaged and one truck was carryingseveral wounded men.   A second military convoy moved out of the capital overnight anddown another vital road used to carry supples to the city of 2.25million people, diplomats said. Government soldiers have beentrying to clear the road to the besieged city of Jalalabad. Theroad has been closed to routine traffic for nearly two weeks. Theguerrillas said they control about 20 miles of the highway, themajor route to the border with Pakistan.   One diplomat said the guerrillas had seized a convoy of emptytrucks returning to Jalalabad, parked them along the road and thenplaced mines inside.   The Soviet Union has been airlifting food and military equipmentto Kabul to help the government of President Najib hold out againstthe rebels.   Supplies also are being airlifted into the strategicallyimportant cities of Jalalabad and Khost, said one senior Sovietsource, speaking on condition of anonymity.   The diplomats said the Salang Highway had been cut by rebelcommander Ahmad Shah Masood and his Jamiat-i-Islami group, whichhas struck deals in the past with the pro-Soviet government toallow some convoys through.   The guerrillas have made blockades a primary tactic in theirfight to overthrow the Marxist government that seized power in anApril 1978 coup.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said Thursdaythat also said fighting had eased around Jalalabad, a provincialcapital 70 miles east of Kabul.   He added, however, that fierce fighting continued near thesouthern towns of Khost and Ghazni.   Amani said six government soldiers died while beating backguerrillas on three fronts around Khost. At least 185 guerrillaswere killed, he said.   The Moslem insurgents based in Pakistan and supported by theUnited States, Saudi Arabia and China launched their offensivearound Jalalabad on March 6 but have not succeeded in dislodginggovernment troops.   The Soviet source said about 2,000 government troops had diedsince the guerrillas began bombarding the city with tens ofthousands of rockets. He said 8,000 rebels had been killed inretaliatory strikes.   He did not know how many civilians have died in the siege.   The Afghan armed forces are equipped with sophisticated weaponsfrom the Soviet Union.   ``They can have the hardware at our disposal in any numbers theywant,'' the official said. ``Jalalabad must be held. It will beheld.''   Soviet officials have denied Moscow sent arms since the trooppullout but that Soviet weapons left are not affected by the Genevaaccord, which prohibits any outside interference.   Still, the Soviets have continued to supply President Najib'sarmy with weapons, including long-range Scud-B missiles now used bygovernment troops against the guerrillas besieging Jalalabad.   In New Delhi, Afghanistan's ambassador today accused Washingtonof violating the accord by arming the guerrillas.   ``The Geneva Accord is fully implemented by Afghanistan and theSoviet Union, but unfortunately the other parties concerned havenot implemented it and the situation has gotten more tense thanever before,'' Abdul Samad Azhar told reporters.   If Jalalabad falls, it would be the largest city captured by therebels in the decade-long civil war and would give them a base toset up their interim government formed in February in Pakistan.   The Soviet military forces completed their withdrawal fromAfghanistan on Feb. 15, ending more than nine years of directinvolvement in the civil war.</TEXT></DOC>
