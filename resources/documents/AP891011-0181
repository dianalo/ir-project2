The Joint Economic Committee also was also told that Japaneseconsumers' tolerance for high prices will remain an invisible tradebarrier, and that the two countries disagree on the meaning of``open markets.''   A former U.S. trade negotiator, Clyde Prestowitz, pressed forthe United States to develop a national industrial policy underwhich it would negotiate for results more specific than what hecalled the unworkable and unrealistic targets of open markets andfree trade.   Prestowitz is the author of ``Trading Places: How we AllowedJapan to Take the Lead,'' a book about the two countries' economicrivalry.   Trade is already managed in some areas, and America's tradepartners have industrial policies, he said, ``so I would like tosee it managed intelligently.'' Prestowitz cited as examples ofmanaged trade, semiconductors, automobiles, machine tools, steel,textiles, air transport and fishing.   Current market-opening policies aggravate tension by spawningaccusations of unfairness, Prestowitz said, maintaining thatJapanese do not clearly understand what Americans mean by ``openmarkets'' and American exporters do not grasp Japanese urgings forthem to ``try harder.''   Robert Z. Lawrence, senior economist at the BrookingsInstitution, a private policy research organization, urged againstwhat he called a ``quick fix'' to the trade imbalance bynegotiating for ``results rather than rules.''   ``In fact, the evidence suggests that the twin policies of astrong yen and detailed negotiations,'' product by product, areworking, if slowly, to increase imports by Japan, he said.   Managed trade, he said, would greatly increase Japanesegovernment influence over the private sector and the result wouldbe to subject America's most competitive high technology industriesto ``intense competition'' from targeted exports.   Lawrence acknowledged, however, that the U.S. dollar's regainedstrength against then Japanese yen points to little or noimprovement in the U.S. trade deficit with Japan in the next yearor two. ``It could well get worse,'' he said _ but if measured inJapanese yen, instead of dollars, the U.S. deficit shows decline.   The imbalance ``will be relatively unaffected'' by tradedevelopments, said Raymond J. Ahearn, trade specialist of theCongressional Research Service.   The deficit with Japan, $52 billion last year, ``will tend toget worse,'' Prestowitz said. ``It's going to be hard to have atrade surplus so long as we have low savings'' in the UnitedStates, he added.</TEXT></DOC>
