Mr.Deretich bowed out of the contested race, resigning in late 1989.;    Butbefore he quit, Mr. Deretich came to accept the Hispanic political revolution.He opposed the council's abortive effort to appeal its loss to the SupremeCourt, and he proposed a compromise district plan on the theory that only thetown itself could determine Watsonville's destiny.;    &quot;He was provoked by thethought of someone coming in and telling us what to do,&quot; said Dennis Osmer,who served with Mr. Deretich on the council. &quot;He realized that the damagecaused by fighting (districts) was a lot worse than having (them).&quot;;    Mr.Deretich's political legacy was opposition to rent control, support foraffordable housing and a knack for constituent service. &quot;He always stood upfor the little guy,&quot; Osmer said.;    Born to a Yugoslavian immigrant family,Mr. Deretich graduated from Watsonville High School in 1951. After two yearsin the Army, he went into the food storage and freezing business, first withCold Storage Co., then with Americold Co.;    A member of the Teamsters andthe American Legion, he won his council seat in 1979 and was named vice mayorin 1987.;    He remained active in local politics until his death, working onwater management and redistricting committees. He also was in the midst ofrestoring a 1941 Chevrolet truck.;    Mr. Deretich's wife, Lucille, said hebore no grudge against those who changed the city.;    &quot;He liked theHispanics,&quot; she said. &quot;He wasn't against it, really. There were a lot ofHispanic people here, and he thought it was time for a change.&quot;; Vido F.Deretich; (box)Born: July 9, 1933, Watsonville.; (box)Died: May 17, 1991,Salinas.; (box)Survived by: Wife, Lucille Deretich of Watsonville; mother,Draga Deretich, Gilroy; sisters, Sophie Gluhaich and Georgina Chuck ofGilroy.; (box)Services: Services are at 2 p.m. Tuesday at the Notre Dame Gym,Watsonville.
