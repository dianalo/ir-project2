SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Census Bureau has hung out an early ``HelpWanted'' sign knowing that staffing up for the count that begins in11 months won't be easy because the temporary jobs don't pay muchand most of the people who used to take them are working full-timenow.   ``We will need to hire about 480,000 persons during the periodOctober 1989 to September 1990, with about 315,000 actually workingat the peak of operations,'' said Charles D. Jones, associatedirector of the Census Bureau.   In some areas there simply will not be enough people, while inothers the agency may be forced to hire those who are onlyminimally qualified because there won't be enough applicants tooffer a choice.   ``As long as the economy is good and the unemployment rate islow we will face a big problem in hiring the number of people thatwe need,'' explained Census spokesman Ray Bancroft.   In 1790 it took just 650 people to count the nation's 3.9million residents. Assistant U.S. marshals did the job.   But the rapidly escalating population required ever more workersas the decades passed: 3,231 enumerators in 1850; 52,871 in 1900and 142,962 by 1950.   This proved a major source of political patronage to the partyin power in the early years, but civil service rules eventuallycame into play for many jobs.   Housewives later became an important factor in this job force,being eager for the extra income from part-time work. That'schanged now, with the majority of wives now working outside thehome, they are no longer available for census jobs.   Indeed, in 1980 the problem became so severe that during peakoperations as many as 30 percent of enumerator jobs were unfilledand many offices suffered from high turnover rates.   Eventually, Census officials had to go back to the old-stylepolitical referral system in that year, asking local officials tosuggest people for the jobs. That won't happen in 1990, the CensusBureau says _ political recruiting is out.   Yet in 1990, even though the majority of households will fillout their census form and mail them in, officials expect to need asmany as 200,000 enumerators to visit the 30 million homes thatdon't respond by mail.   The remaining workers needed for the count will fill temporaryoffice jobs tabulating, running computers and managing local anddistrict offices.   During preparation of the address lists for the 1990 count, some28 percent of local offices reported problems in hiring sufficientstaff. Turnover rates reached 60 percent in some areas, double whathad been expected, according to a report from the GeneralAccounting Office.   As a result, Census officials increased their recruitmentefforts and have moved to change their pay system from a uniform$6-per-hour rate to one based on local needs, paying up to$8-per-hour where necessary to be competitive with other employers.   In addition, Rep. Thomas C. Sawyer, D-Ohio, proposed solving apart of the hiring problem by hiring retired federal and postalworkers and military officers around the nation.   He has proposed legislation that would permit these retirees toaccept Census jobs, on a temporary basis, without having theirretirement benefits reduced as required by current law.   As many as 1.5 million to 2 million people may be covered bythis change, which drew wide support at a hearing called by Sawyer.   Retired federal workers are accustomed to working within abureaucracy, are already trained in many of the skills that will beneeded and often are familiar with local geography and residents,noted Judith Park of the National Association of retired FederalEmployees.   In addition, the Bureau is working with state employmentservices offices in every state to get referrals, and is alsoseeking help from local governments and minority organizations.   Workers will need to pass a written test and must be UnitedStates citizens to work for the bureau. They should be at least 18years old, although the bureau says that it can hire people asyoung as 16 if they have a high school diploma.</TEXT></DOC>
