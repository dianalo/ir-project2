(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A state senator, under indictment on acharge that he accepted a bribe while serving as a countycommissioner, has been named chairman of the Mingo CountyDemocratic Party.   Sen. Truman Chafin is the fifth consecutive Mingo CountyDemocratic chairman to face criminal charges.   He faces a state bribery charge in a scheme to sell thesheriff's job from Johnie Owens to Charles ``Eddie'' Hilbert for$100,000. Owens, a former county Democratic chairman, and Hilberthave pleaded guilty to charges in connection with the scheme.   Chafin, accused of accepting a bribe to stay away from thecommission meeting which approved the transfer of the job fromOwens to Hilbert, has pleaded innocent and denies any involvementin the alleged scheme.   The county Democratic Executive Committee voted 7-6 Thursday toname Chafin county chairman.   The previous chairman, E. Donald Evans, resigned at the requestof the U.S. attorney's office after being indicted a month ago on aconspiracy to commit vote fraud charge.   His predecessor was Owens, who is serving a 14-year federalprison sentence.   Owens' predecessor as chairman was Stewart Justice, who wasacquitted on a state bribery charge last year. Justice'spredecessor, Noah Floyd, was acquitted on federal conspiracycharges in the early 1970s.   The politically powerful county chairmanship had been vacant fora month since Evans resigned. Local politicians say they can neverremember the post being vacant for so long.   Mingo, a poverty-stricken coal-mining county, has borne areputation for corruption for years. In 1986, the fire chief ofKermit was convicted of running a ``drug carry-out'' operation nextdoor to the town police department.   In elections for county office on May 11, the voters rejectedthree of five candidates under criminal indictment.</TEXT></DOC>
