<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-05-0547 </DOCNO><TEXT>Immersion experiments have been performed to investigate the diffusionof liquid uranium into 0.3 mm thick foils of tantalum metal and tantalum-10wt%tungsten alloy in the temperature range of 1160/sup 0/C to 1350/sup 0/C,for reaction times up to 20 h, in zirconia crucibles. The orginal anduranium-reacted foils have been studied microscopically (SEM-EDAX) anda multilayer structure is revealed in the reacted foils. Layers identifiedfor tantalum immersed in uranium: Uranium-tantalum (U/Ta {approx_equal}1), precipitated columnar tantalum (andless; 1wt% U), inner uranium, and innertantalum (with grown grains and uranium along grain boundaries). Layersidentified for Ta-10wt% W alloy immersed in uranium: Uranium-tantalum(U/Ta {approx_equal} 1, 0.3wt% W), precipitated tantalum (andless; 1wt% U, downto 1-2wt% W), and inner Escher-type grains of tantalum-tungsten (up to18wt% W) and of uranium (andless; 2wt% Ta, andless; 0.4wt% W). A mechanism for themultilayer formation and the intrusion of liquid uranium into the solidfoils is proposed and substantiated.</TEXT></DOC>
