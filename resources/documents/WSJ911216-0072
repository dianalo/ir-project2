But the agency doesn't expect to be paid any time soonbecause the liability insurer for the officers and directorscontends that its policy doesn't cover regulatory actions,and the defendants are operating under bankruptcy-courtprotection.</LP><TEXT>   Nevertheless, the verdict is noteworthy because of itssize and because there is a verdict at all: 90% to 95% of theFDIC's suits alleging liability on the part of officers anddirectors are settled before they ever reach a courtroom, anagency spokeswoman said.   The case is also unusual because it is among the first togo to trial on allegations of gross negligence -- a chargethat requires the FDIC to prove deeper involvement on thepart of defendants than must be shown to prove a charge ofsimple negligence. The tougher standards were made part offederal thrift and banking laws when they were rewritten inAugust 1989. In some cases, the FDIC has successfullysidestepped the gross negligence requirements by applying astate charge of simple negligence, but the agency's attemptto do so in this case was unsuccessful.   The FDIC alleged that former Chairman Gus Mijalis, twodirectors and two officers of the failed Bank of Commerce ofShreveport, La., were grossly negligent in approving $30million worth of loans, mostly for commercial real estateventures, that weren't repaid. Mr. Mijalis, a Shreveportbusinessman, was tried and acquitted of racketeering chargeswith Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards in 1986.   The defendants, using testimony from an economics expert,argued that the loans soured because of the local andnational economy, not because they were poor risks at theoutset. But the jurors &quot;didn't buy the economy defense atall,&quot; said Mr. Mijalis's lawyer, James D'Anna of Shreveport.&quot;They basically took what the FDIC regulators said as gospel.They looked at them as champions of the taxpayers.&quot;   Because Mr. Mijalis and the other defendants are underbankruptcy-court protection from creditors, the FDIC isprecluded from pressing them to collect the jury award. Thatleaves the directors' and officers' insurance carrier,International Insurance Co., a unit of Crum andamp; Forster Inc.,Basking Ridge, N.J.   But the insurer's attorney, Phillip W. Preis of BatonRouge, La., said his client intends to dispute its liabilitybecause the claim wasn't made within the time limitprescribed by the policy and because the policy doesn't coverregulatory actions against the bank and its officers. Severalinsurance companies have won court rulings limiting theirliability for regulatory actions.   All of the defendants intend to appeal. The outsidelawyers for the FDIC, from the New Orleans firm of Stone,Pigman, Walther, Wittmann andamp; Hutchinson, couldn't be reachedfor comment.   ---   PUNITIVE DAMAGE awards thrown out in Virginia and WestVirginia.   A federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., and the stateSupreme Court in West Virginia set aside separate jury awardson grounds that judicial review of whether the amounts wereexcessive did not meet constitutional requirementsestablished last year by the U.S. Supreme Court.   Appeals courts in four states have now revamped thestandards judges should apply when reviewing punitive damageawards by juries. In the recent decisions, the Fourth CircuitCourt of Appeals in Virginia and West Virginia's high courtfound that standards in those states were too vague andadopted guidelines set by the Supreme Court.   Punitive damages, usually awarded by juries in addition tocompensatory damages, are meant to punish wrongdoing anddiscourage future misconduct. Advocates of legal reform andcorporate defendants have long complained that high punitivedamages are unconstitutional because juries are given toolittle guidance, resulting in awards that are out ofproportion to actual harm.   Last year's U.S. Supreme Court decision in Pacific MutualLife Insurance Co. vs. Haslip was the court's first attemptto provide guidance on punitive damages. But courts remaindeeply and almost evenly split about whether to follow thoseguidelines.   The Virginia case involved a discrimination suit against aroller rink and a sheriff's deputy in which the plaintiff,who allegedly had been harassed, manhandled and arrested, wasawarded $25,000 in compensatory damages and $175,500 inpunitive damages. A federal judge upheld the amount becauseVirginia law defines &quot;excessive&quot; punitive damages as thosethat either &quot;shock the conscience of the court&quot; or suggestthat the jury was influenced by &quot;passion or prejudice.&quot;   In the West Virginia case, a jury awarded a couple livingnear a landfill nothing in compensatory damages but $105,000in punitive damages. The trial judge upheld the verdictbecause under West Virginia law, punitive damages can only bethrown out if they are &quot;monstrous&quot; or lack any &quot;foundation inthe evidence.&quot;   In reversing those decisions, the appeals courts ruledthat the existing standards were insufficient. The appealscourts said that a judge reviewing the fairness of such anaward must consider what the case has already cost theparties, whether criminal penalties have been levied, whatrelated civil suits are pending and whether the amount willencourage fair and reasonable settlements &quot;when a clear wronghas been committed.&quot;   In the Virginia case, the appeals judges stronglysuggested that the punitive damage award would stand up tothe stricter guidelines. A new trial was ordered in the WestVirginia case.   Lawyers for the plaintiffs in the cases couldn't bereached for comment.   (James H. Johnson vs. Hugo's Skateway and Commonwealth ofVirginia, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit,Richmond. Fleming Landfill Inc. vs. Julian and Sharon Barnes,Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia.)   ---   INSURANCE DOESN'T COVER Superfund cleanup costs, courtrules.   A federal appeals court issued the rulings in two suitsbrought by Arkansas businesses seeking coverage for cleanupcosts ordered by the Environmental Protection Agency. TheEighth Circuit Court of Appeals decided against awardingcoverage, reinforcing an earlier ruling by the court that hasbeen contradicted by other courts.   Separate three-judge panels ruled that under Arkansasstate law, comprehensive general liability policies do notcover environmental cleanup costs assessed by the government.   One case involved a 20-acre wood treatment facility nearOmaha, Ark., owned by a subsidiary of San Francisco-basedMcKesson Corp. A McKesson spokeswoman said the EPA hasestimated that it will cost between $11 million and $15million to clean up the site. She said McKesson is reviewingthe decision.   The EPA had ordered Parker Solvents Co., Inc., a FortSmith, Ark., distributor of industrial chemicals, tocontribute $120,000 toward cleaning up a dump, said P.K.Holmes, the company's Fort Smith attorney. He said Parker hadnot decided whether to appeal.   Legal battles over whether cleanup costs are covered byinsurers are likely to continue. At stake is the $500 billionestimated as necessary to clean up contaminated Superfundsites.   Insurance companies arguing against coverage havefrequently cited Eighth Circuit decisions. But policyholdersrely on appeals court decisions that have gone the other way.One such case, decided by a federal appeals court inWashington, D.C., pointedly contradicted the Eighth Circuit.   (Parker vs. Royal Insurance Cos. of America, EighthCircuit, U.S. Court of Appeal, 90-2224, and Grisham vs.Commercial Union Insurance Co., 89-14810.)   ---   MINNESOTA DRUG LAW is found unconstitutional by state'shigh court.   The state Supreme Court decided that Minnesota cannotimpose a harsher sentence for possessing crack, the purifiedform of cocaine, than for possessing a like amount ofpowdered cocaine. In a 6-1 decision, the justices found thatthe disparity violates the equal-protection clause of thestate constitution.   Hennepin County public defenders showed that most peopleconvicted of cocaine possession in the county are white andHispanic, while most convicted of crack possession are black.   Though prosecutors argued that the drug law passed federalequal-protection standards, which require provendiscriminatory intent, the court hewed instead to Minnesota'sstricter test. Because the distinction between crack usersand powdered cocaine users isn't &quot;genuine and substantial,&quot;the court wrote, the law is unconstitutional.   The decision, expected to affect up to 100 pending cases,upholds the ruling of a district judge who dismissed drugcharges against five black men in December 1990.   In a 15-page dissent, Justice M. Jean Coyne called themajority decision &quot;an activist form of judicial review.&quot;   (Supreme Court of Minnesota, state of Minnesota vs.Russell et al., C3-91-22 and C7-91-203.)</TEXT></DOC>
