A jury at Chelmsford Crown Court east of London deliberated 13hours before finding the men guilty on Friday. Three others hadpleaded guilty in September and two were acquitted.   The operation was the first success of a 1987 agreement betweenPrime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Soviet President Mikhail S.Gorbachev to exchange information and work together to fight drugtrafficking.   Operation Diplomat began after Soviet customs officers on theAfghan border found 3{ tons of high-quality black Afghan hashishconcealed in a consignment of licorice root destined for Britain.   Soviet authorities allowed British officers to track the $16million worth of drugs to find the smugglers.   The hashish traveled through Moscow and traced to the Tilburydocks outside London, where it arrived on March 31. Several weekslater the drugs were taken to a London warehouse where police andcustoms agents arrested the British smugglers.   British customs officials say no Soviets were arrested.   During the Britons' 11-week trial, Vladimir Skripnik, a seniorSoviet customs officer, became the first Soviet law enforcementofficial to testify in a British court.   ``Cooperation is only possible as a result of the changes thathave taken place and are now taking place in the Soviet Union,'' hesaid afterward. ``This would have been impossible not long ago.''   Douglas Tweddle, Britain's chief customs investigator, saidfurther joint investigations were expected, and that Britain hopedfor similar cooperation with other Eastern European countries inlight of recent political reforms.   ``Operation Diplomat ... is an excellent example of how suchagreements can help both parties,'' he said.   The jury convicted Martin Reeves, 42, of smuggling nearly 3{tons of hashish and Andrew George, 37, of laundering drug money.   Judge Brian Watling delayed sentencing until he receives arequest from Britain's Customs and Excise authorities for theconfiscation of more than $8 million of their assets.   Earlier, James Rose, 53, who was described as the leader of thedrug ring, and Alan Small, 54, pleaded guilty to conspiring toimport hashish between August 1984 and April 1988. Rose's son,Richard, 25, pleaded guilty to importing the drug.</TEXT></DOC>
