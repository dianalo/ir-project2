The Dutch, the hosts of the two-day 68-nation conference, hopeparticipating nations will commit themselves to stabilizingemissions of greenhouse-related gases by the end of the century.   The greenhouse effect is believed to be the cause of a gradualwarming of the atmposphere. The warming could eventually turnfertile land into deserts and flood densely populated coastalplains.   Experts believe that to stop the effect, a major reduction isneeded of emissions of greenhouse-causing gases, particularlycarbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, known as CFCs, methane, andnitrous oxides.   But a number of nations are unwilling to commit themselves tosuch measures for now and say this conference is not the properforum for such commitments.   They want to postpone formal discussions until a meeting of theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in Washington next year.   A draft communique calls for ``recognition of the need tostabilize (emissions) by the year 2000 and to develop policy toolsto achieve that goal.''   The United States, Britain and Japan had opposed the communiquebut on Sunday agreed to reopen talks on the issue, according toMarjan van der Giezen, a spokeswoman for the Dutch EnvironmentMinistry.   ``It looks as if we might succeed in keeping those threeaboard,'' Ms. Van der Giezen told The Associated Press.   Participation of major industrialized nations in the fightagainst the greenhouse effect is ``essential,'' according to PierVellinga, the Dutch Environment Ministry's key expert in climatepolicy.   In all, developed nations in the northern hemisphere _ includingthe East bloc _ produce 65 percent of all greenhouse-relatedemissions, Vellinga said.</TEXT></DOC>
