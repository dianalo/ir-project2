With stocks depressed in Black Monday's wake, corporations consider replacing executive-option plans with ones that offer lower prices; some may switch to cash incentives. SL Industries Inc., Marlton, N.J., swaps new options at $8.625 a share for old ones at $11.50. Some computer makers will offer options more often, to better reflect market prices, says Gary Teesdale, a vice president of consultant Hay Group.    Houston's Anadarko Petroleum Corp. may lend executives money to exercise their options. But Campbell Soup Co., F.W. Woolworth Co. and Xerox Corp. will stick by their plans, awaiting a market rebound. Some, like Great Atlantic andamp; Pacific Tea Co., consider new option plans, to capitalize on lower prices.    Many firms want to act, but fear angering workers who don't get options, says Geoffrey Wiegman, a Georgetown, Conn., consultant.    DEBATE HEATS UP over revamping federal jobless pay.    Though states had unemployment compensation trust-fund surpluses totaling $17.3 billion as of June 30, warning flags are going up. The congressional General Accounting Office says state funds are increasingly insolvent and ill-prepared to cover the unemployed in the next recession. An October drop in those getting benefits to 25.4% of the unemployed, a new low, reflects federal program cuts and long-term joblessness.    The AFL-CIO urges enriched benefits. But business groups call instead for an end to the &quot;temporary&quot; 0.2% payroll tax that Congress added to the basic 0.6% levy in 1976, even as Congress moves to extend the add-on for another three years. State Chambers of Commerce say the payroll tax penalizes job creation.    PAPER WORK MOUNTS, defying office efforts to reduce it.    White-collar workers spend up to 70% of their time shuffling paper, a Personnel Journal study shows; many managers use memos to avoid action. Data Translation Inc., a Marlboro, Mass., computer-parts firm, uses electronic mail to trim paper work. But government regulation adds to the burden: Treasurer Napoleon Holmes has worn out three briefcases in two years.    Monarch Capital Corp., a Springfield, Mass., insurer, says workers are getting used to less paper, thanks to automation. Corning Glass Works says it has pared internal reports, but forms and junk mail still fill up cabinets and drawers. Desktop publishing churns out new paper, even as electronic mail saves it, Apple Computer says. &quot;The paperless office is a myth,&quot; an Apple official adds.    Chambers Development Corp., Monroeville, Pa., says many memos are too long, and half are ignored.    LOCK THE DOORS: As Wall Street firms lay off employees, they have increased budgets for security guards 20%, says Ira Lipman, president of Guardsmark, a security firm. He cites fears that disgruntled former workers may sabotage equipment or harm co-workers, as well as fears of violent behavior by clients.    JAPANESE WORKERS stay in a job longer than U.S. workers -- not for cultural reasons but because they are trained more, a National Bureau of Economic Research report says. So Japanese wages rise faster, workers become more productive for their firm, and they grow more attached to it, the authors conclude.    THEY DON'T CARE: Fewer than 50% of American workers think their bosses properly motivate them, provide regular performance &quot;feedback&quot; or solve &quot;people problems,&quot; according to a survey of 5,000 employees by Wyatt Co., consultants. It also says any better such efforts by supervisors are seldom rewarded.    HIRING PLANS stay high for the first half of 1988 despite the stock-market crash. In a survey by Cleveland-based Management Recruiters International, 35% of 2,220 respondents plan to add middle-management and professional staff in that period, while only 12% contemplate reductions.    OSHA BASHING by unions rises despite increased enforcement.    The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has imposed big penalties on many firms in recent months, but unions increasingly criticize the agency as still too easy on employers. Paper, Steel and Auto Workers unions complain that OSHA cut them out of the process while prematurely settling cases against Scott Paper Co., Monsanto Co. and auto makers. Building trades call for a new regulatory agency, terming OSHA's record &quot;horrendous.&quot;    The AFL-CIO sees &quot;broad&quot; union dissatisfaction with OSHA. A Wisconsin watchdog group says OSHA doesn't protect workers who protest safety lags. Food trades say OSHA backed away from penalty action against injury and illness reporting at IBP's Emporia, Kan., meat plant, after levying a stiff fine on IBP at another plant.    An OSHA spokesman finds union criticism &quot;surprising . . . after two years of effective, even costly,&quot; efforts.    THE CHECKOFF: Only 39% of companies now reimburse employees for drinks at business meetings, down from 60% in 1979, a survey by the Administrative Management Society shows. . . . Nearly a third of 1,000 manufacturing and service workers surveyed by consultant Towers Perrin said they would &quot;jump ship&quot; for a job at another company, at equal pay, if given a chance. </TEXT></DOC>
