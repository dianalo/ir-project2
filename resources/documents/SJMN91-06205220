A gusty wind carried someof the paint onto some of the cars.;    Over the next 18 months, FarmersInsurance Group -- which covered the painting company -- processed about 280claims for vehicles that supposedly needed new paint jobs. Authorities nowbelieve more than 100 of those claims were phony, said John Auvinen, a fraudinvestigator for the state Department of Insurance.;    According to Auvinenand other officials, about 200 of the claims involved cost estimates preparedby Fred Stanek, owner of a now-defunct shop in Sunnyvale called Laser AutoCollision.;    The investigation started in September 1988 when Farmersreceived a tip from &quot;someone associated with Laser Auto Collision,&quot; accordingto Auvinen, who refused to identify the informant.;    Stanek is among the 14people charged Friday in Santa Clara Municipal Court with 21 felony counts ofgrand theft and fraud, officials said Monday. Stanek's wife, Stacey, hisdaughter, Anne Stanek, and two Laser employees, Danny Martin and Phil Ataide,also were named in the complaint.;    Authorities allege that many of theclaims submitted by Stanek's firm were processed at Farmers by Pat Lillie, aformer claims adjuster for Farmers who handled other phony claims for a secondbody shop, Santa Clara Auto Body.;    Lillie left Farmers in 1988 and wentinto business with the owner of the Santa Clara shop, Chungil &quot;John&quot; Chun. Thetwo operated Mission Car Rental, according to Auvinen. But before Lillie leftFarmers, he received $65,000 from Chun, according to investigators who seizedLillie's bank records.;    Both men have been charged in the case, along withLillie's former supervisor, Marc Clark. Authorities say Clark also may havehelped process phony claims for his relatives.;    Auvinen said he does notknow whether the idea for the alleged fraud originated with the insurancecompany employees or the body-shop owners.;    &quot;We don't know who approachedwho,&quot; he said.;    Lillie also has been charged with approving bogus claimsand fraudulent payments for several friends based on estimates that wereprepared by using forms from Elite Auto Body shop in Santa Clara.Investigators say the shop was not responsible for those estimates.;    Thecharges were announced Monday at a news conference by state InsuranceCommissioner John Garamendi and Santa Clara County District Attorney GeorgeKennedy. Kennedy said the defendants face an average of seven years each inprison.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  BRANDON BAILEY, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910723  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  505  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday July 23, 199100205220,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
