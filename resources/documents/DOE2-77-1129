Suitable management includesinterim storage, treatment and immobilization prior to disposal of theconditioned waste. This report deals with the treatment and conditioningof organic radioactive wastes for storage and disposal. The wastes consideredin the report arise from nuclear fuel cycle operations, including fuelfabrication, reactor operation, fuel reprocessing, decontamination operations,and from fuel cycle research and development. Liquid organic wastes typicallyinclude lubricating and hydraulic fluids from reactor operation, solventsand diluents from fuel reprocessing, scintillation fluids from analyticallaboratories, dry cleaning solvents and miscellaneous organic solventsfrom decontamination and decommissioning activities. Solid wastes consistof cellulosic materials, such as paper, rags and wood, and a varietyof plastic and rubber items, such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene(PE), neoprene and natural rubber. These arise from reactor operationand maintenance and from glove box use in fuel fabrication and reprocessing.Most organic wastes contain only low levels of {beta}/{gamma}-activityand are substantially {alpha}-free. A lesser, but not inconsiderable,volume of organic waste is contaminated to higher levels with {alpha}-emittingtransuranic (TRU) elements. Options for the treatment of organic wastesare influenced principally by the physical and chemical composition ofeach waste stream, whereas they may all be treated under similar conditionsof radiological protection due to the absence of levels of {beta}/{gamma}-activitywhich would require shielding.
