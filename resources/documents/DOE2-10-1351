In particular,discrete samples of input and output data of a system with uncertaincharacteristics are used to determine the parameters of its model. Theidentification algorithm is based on recursive least squares, QR decomposition,and block-processing techniques with covariance resetting. Along similarlines as previous approaches, the identification process is based onthe use of Givens rotations. This approach uses the Cordic algorithmfor improved numerical efficiency in performing the rotations. Additionally,floating-point and fixed-point arithmetic implementations are compared.</TEXT></DOC>
