The rod driving mechanism is composed of four steppingmotors, gear boxes, cable sheaves and encoders. Hybrid two phase steppingmotors of 1.8 degree step angle are used, and 1-2 phase excitation modeis used. Pulse generator is designed using an INTEL 8085A microprocessor.Two types of shaft encoders are used to control the rod's movement andto detect any error. The encoders used for input side (stepping motorshaft) are 200 pulses per revolution and the other ones for output side(sheaveshaft) are 1000 pulses per revolution. The control program is writtenin Turbo-Basic language, and the control rods can be controlled automaticallyand manually.</TEXT></DOC>
