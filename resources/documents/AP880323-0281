(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal judge approved Texaco Inc.'sfinancial reorganization plan today, clearing the way for the oilgiant to emerge from the nation's biggest corporate bankruptcy case.   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Howard Schwartzberg issued the ruling atmidday after a day-and-a-half hearing on the proposal for resolvingTexaco's debts to its creditors.   The confirmation of the plan should allow Texaco to emerge frombankruptcy court protection by mid-April, which would be a yearafter it filed to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the federalbankruptcy code.   Texaco had cleared one hurdle just before the hearing beganTuesday, when it announced that dissident shareholders had droppedtheir opposition to the plan.   It also was announced Tuesday that 96 percent of the sharesvoted by Texaco stockholders had supported the reorganizationproposal _ 174 million shares out of the 181 million voted. Themargin was far in excess of the two-thirds majority required byfederal law.   Schwartzberg had been widely expected to approve the plandespite lingering objections to certain provisions of the plan bysome shareholders _ notably takeover strategist Carl C. Icahn,Texaco's biggest shareholder.   Texaco was the biggest company ever to seek refuge in thebankruptcy courts.   Texaco filed under Chapter 11 contending it could not afford topost an $11 billion bond while appealing a $10.3 billion judgmentheld against it by Houston-based Pennzoil Co.   The judgment stemmed from a November 1985 ruling by a Houstonjury that Texaco had interfered improperly with an agreement byPennzoil to acquire part of Getty Oil Co. before Texaco boughtGetty itself.   Texaco agreed in December to pay Pennzoil $3 billion to settlethat dispute. The agreement formed the keystone of the bankruptcyreorganization plan that Schwartzberg must confirm or reject afterthe present series of hearings.   Some of the dissident shareholders had objected to provisions inthe agreement that would free officers and advisers of Texaco,Pennzoil Co., the former Getty Oil Co., the Sarah Getty Trust andthe J. Paul Getty Museum from all liability arising out of thecourt fight resulting from the Texaco-Pennzoil battle.   Shortly before the hearing began, Harvey Miller, the bankruptcylawyer representing Texaco, announced that attorneys for thoseshareholders had dropped their opposition to the reorganizationplan.   In a document filed Tuesday, the dissidents said they endedtheir fight partly because of ``overwhelming evidence that asettlement with Pennzoil is not possible without the releases.''   Pennzoil attorney Kenneth Klee said Pennzoil had insisted theliability provisions be included in the settlement agreement.Pennzoil Chairman J. Hugh Liedtke testified his company wanted thereleases mainly to help end the litigation, settle its claimagainst Texaco, and win more cooperation from Texaco's management.   The dissident shareholders also noted Texaco had agreed not toobject if their attorneys applied for a maximum of $10 million infees, plus $150,000 in expenses. Miller told Schwartzberg thecompany would assume half of those expenses, and that its insurancewould pay the bill.   While some shareholders opposed to the liability releases,others were unhappy with anti-takeover provisions of Texaco'scharter and bylaws that they argued entrenched management andlessened its accountability for its actions.   The leader of the latter group was Icahn, whose ownership of14.8 percent of Texaco's common stock has helped fuel takeoverspeculation in recent months. But despite his opposition to thoseprovisions, Icahn had indicated he would vote for thereorganization plan.   During the hearing, Texaco officials drew some pointed questionsafter disclosing they had just closed on an agreement to borrow $3billion from a syndicate of banks to help refinance their pendingreorganization.   In repeated questioning of Texaco treasurer David Crickelair,Icahn's attorney David Friedman and Dennis O'Dea, an attorneyrepresenting Texaco's shareholders committee, implied Texaco helpedentrench its management by accepting a ``change in control''proviso in the loan agreement.   Under the provision, two-thirds of the banks could vote to callthe three-year loan if 30 percent of Texaco's stock wound up in onegroup's hands, or if there was a change of more than half of themembers of the board.   But Crickelair said the provision had been demanded by the banksand was non-negotiable.</TEXT></DOC>
