Hooks called for a march on the nation's capitalnext month to protest the rulings.   ``We're not going to let four men and a woman in black robes turnus around any more than we'll let white robes turn us around,''Hooks said Thursday, referring to the garb traditionally worn byKlan members.   Meanwhile, the Rev. Jesse Jackson challenged President Bush tooffer blacks and other minorities more than ``kinder and gentler''words.   ``(Former President) Reagan laid the tracks and built the engineto take the rights of workers and women and African-Americans andHispanics and the poor. Bush is putting grease on those tracks, notbrakes,'' Jackson told 3,500 cheering people at the closing sessionof the group's 80th annual convention.   ``We all appreciate President Bush's appeal, a shift fromhostility to be kinder and gentler. We appreciate that he isprepared to meet and greet us and even sup with us and even shakeour hands.   ``But after six months, it is time to look beyond the smile andlook at the substance, because thousands of poor people, workingpeople, women, African-Americans and Hispanics need more thankindness and gentleness,'' said Jackson, who received the group'scoveted Spingarn Medal for achievement by an American black.   The harsh criticism of the Supreme Court contrasted with the warmwords Hooks had for Bush earlier in the week for his appointmentsand for inviting black leaders to the White House.   In the term just ended, the high court struck down contractguarantees for minority firms, made it tougher to prove bias in theworkplace while making it easier for white males to contestaffirmative action, and allowed states to impose restrictions onabortions.   The rulings ``have impacted on the civil rights laws already onthe books. They have pinched them back so far that they have madethem nearly null and void,'' said Hooks, the group's executivedirector.   The nation's oldest and largest civil rights organization,addressed this week by Vice President Dan Quayle and Bush cabinetmembers Jack Kemp and Louis Sullivan, decided to protest theadministration's apparent inaction following the court rulings bycalling for the Aug. 26 march, Hooks said.   The remarks by Hooks and former Democratic presidential candidateJackson continued the attacking tone set earlier in the day byDemocratic National Chairman Ronald Brown.   ``We hear new words from the Republican Party,'' said Brown, aformer Jackson campaigner and the first black to head the nationalparty. ``In politics, as in poker, there's a phrase for it.   ``I believe it's time that we tell George Bush, Dan Quayle, JackKemp, (national GOP Chairman) Lee Atwater and the rest of thoseRepublicans it's time to put up or shut up.''   Several other speakers also attacked the Supreme Court, includingformer U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ChairwomanEleanor Holmes Norton.   ``The Reagan administration is over at long last, but through thecourt, the music lingers on,'' she said. ``What we stand to lose isawesome.''   Norton said civil rights activists should turn to Congress andthe Bush administration for redress now that conservativeRepublicans she characterized as opposed to civil rights control thejudiciary.   After his speech to the convention Wednesday, Quayle toldreporters the president did not feel the court decisions needed tobe overturned to advance civil rights.   But Jackson and others said legislation should be introduced inthe wake of the court rulings, which he said had shifted ``theburden of proof (of discrimination) onto the backs of theoppressed.''   ``Congress should introduce legislation clarifying the originalintent and meaning of affirmative action,'' he said. ``And PresidentBush should support it and agree not to veto it.''</TEXT></DOC>
