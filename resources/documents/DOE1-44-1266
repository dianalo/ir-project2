<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-44-1266 </DOCNO><TEXT>Assuming that future experiments confirm Aspect's discovery of nonlocalinteractions between quantum pairs of correlated particles, the authorsanalyze the constraints imposed by the EPR reasoning on the said interactions.It is then shown that the nonlocal relativistic quantum potential approachplainly satisfies the Einstein causality criteria as well as the energy-momentumconservation in individual microprocesses. Furthermore, this approachbypasses a new causal paradox for timelike separated EPR measurementsdeduced by Sutherland in the frame of an approach by means of space-timezigzags with advanced potentials. It is finally demonstrated that thisinherent quantum causal direct interaction established permanent EPRcorrelations which are always restricted to spacelike separations andare instantaneous only in the center-of-mass rest frame of the two-particlesystem.</TEXT></DOC>
