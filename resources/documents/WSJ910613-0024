The Houston computer maker said it uses solvents withchlorofluorocarbons to clean circuit-board assemblies and forother uses in making personal computers. The solvents removeresidues that could eventually decrease the performance ofthe circuit boards, Compaq said.</LP><TEXT>   Although chlorofluorocarbons aren't hazardous, they arebelieved to contribute to the depletion of the ozone in theearth's upper atmosphere.   Beginning this summer, Compaq said it will use a new,&quot;no-clean&quot; process in making its circuit boards, calling forit to use materials that won't corrode and can be left on theboards. It said it plans to eliminate the use of CFCs inmanufacturing &quot;no later than 1995.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
