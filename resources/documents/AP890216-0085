The declaration on Tehran Radio followed other reports that deathsquads from Islamic countries were en route to Britain in search ofthe writer, whose novel ``The Satanic Verses'' has outraged manyMoslem fundamentalists.   Britain, which reopened its embassy in Tehran in December for thefirst time in eight years, condemned the threats and announced ithad frozen plans to ``build up further our embassy.''   United News of India and the British Broadcasting Corp. saidtelephone callers threatened to bomb British planes to India unlessRushdie appeared in public. Two airlines, British Airways and AirEurope, said they were taking the threat seriously.   The Indian news agency said a man claiming to speak for thepreviously unheard of Iranian Guards telephoned its Bombay officetoday with the threats.   Pakistan's government demanded the United States and Britain banthe book and that all copies of it be destroyed. Six people died inPakistan during a weekend riot over the book.   An Iranian cleric on Wednesday offered up to $2.6 million forRushdie's murder, and the author canceled a U.S. promotional tourthat was scheduled to begin Friday.   A leading Islamic theologian in Egypt said today Khomeini erredin sending death squads after Rushdie without first giving him achance to repent. Sheik Mohammed Hossam-el-Din said the book shouldbe banned and burned, but executing its author would be ``virtuallyimpossible'' under the tenets of Islam.   British news media said the Indian-born Rushdie was hiding withhis wife, American novelist Marianne Wiggins, under police guard.Press Association, the domestic British news agency, said Rushdie'sfirst wife, Clarissa Luard, also had been given police protection.   Tehran Radio, monitored in Cyprus, said religious figures in thenorthwestern Iranian city of Urumiyeh declared in a statement:   ``We have already put on our death shrouds and pledge to carryout the Imam's (Khomeini's) death sentence against Salman Rushdieand his publishers in the United States and Europe.''   Iran's lone diplomat in Britain, Mohammed Basti, was summoned tothe Foreign Office in London to discuss the situation and emergeddefiant, telling reporters Khomeini's ``decree or verdict'' had beendelivered ``after careful consideration.''   ``It has nothing to do particularly with your country,'' thecharge d'affaires said.   The Foreign Office called Khomeini's statement ``totallyunacceptable.''   ``We recognize that Moslems and others may have strong viewsabout the contents of Mr. Rushdie's book,'' it said in a statement.``However, no one has the right to incite people to violence onBritish soil or against British citizens.''   Rushdie, 41, was born into a Moslem family in India but is aBritish citizen. Since ``The Satanic Verses'' was published inBritain in September, it has sold more than 100,000 copies here andreceived critical acclaim.   Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said today protests were being filedin Washington and London seeking a ban on the novel.   Pakistani fundamentalist leaders called for nationwide protestsFriday to condemn the book and denounce the deaths and injuries inSunday's protests by Moslem fundamentalists demanding ``The SatanicVerses'' be pulled from U.S. shelves.   The book has been banned in countries with large Moslempopulations, including India and South Africa, as well as mostIslamic nations, including Pakistan, Bangladesh and Egypt.   No official ban has been announced in Iran, where the populationis overwhelmingly Shiite Moslem, but most foreign publications havebeen banned in that country for years.   In New York, a statement issued on behalf of author and publishersaid ``the current climate is not appropriate for a promotional tourin the United States.'' The statement said: ``We reiterate that nooffense was intended in the creation or publication of this work.''   The French publishing house Christian Bourgois said it wasdelaying publication of the novel to avoid risk to the company, itsclients and readers.   One of Italy's leading publishing companies, Arnoldo MondadoriEditore SpA, announced today it will go ahead with next week'splanned release of ``The Satanic Verses.''   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Wednesdaythat a senior Moslem clergyman in Iran, Hojatoleslam Hassan Saneie,had offered $2.6 million to any Iranian who kills Rushdie and $1million to a foreigner who kills the author.   Tehran Radio said today that Mohammad Hashemian, the religiousleader in the southeastern city of Kerman, pledged another $2.6million reward.   A major character in the novel is named Mahound, a medievalcorruption of the name of the prophet Mohammed. Moslems havecomplained the book represents the prophet's wives as prostitutesand suggests that he wrote the Koran, rather than receiving it fromGod.   The title refers to verses Mohammed removed from the Koran,Islam's holy book, believing they had been inspired by the devil.</TEXT></DOC>
