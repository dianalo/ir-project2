In aworld of homogenizing images, most of them made in the United States, Vietnamstill seems very foreign, very different from us.;    Driving in from Tan SonNhut Airport, as so many American politicians and generals and thinkers did 30years ago, in the high whine of little motorbike engines, it is hard toimagine whatever made the Americans of the 1960s think they could beat orremake these people in their own strange (to us) land -- or why we thought itwas so important.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  WHAT IF WE WIN?  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  CommentaryRichard Reeves is a nationally syndicated columnist.  </MEMO><TEXT>     We must have been crazy. Time magazine was alternately ranting and purringthat the place was just like Virginia in 1789 or Hawaii in 1959. A newpresident, John F. Kennedy, was saying that if Laos fell then Vietnam wouldfall and India would be next. India? That's what he said.;    Somehow itseemed to make sense at the time to a lot of very smart people -- a lot morepeople than now think we can defeat and remake Arabia. Even if Time magazine,which has a lot less power than it did before television took towar-mongering, now presents Kuwait as Virginia in 1789 or as New Mexico in1989.;    Well, we lost in Vietnam. We threw away half a generation; 55,000 ofthem got killed. We kept the damned Cold War going for another 10 years or soby destroying our own political credibility and self-respect. As for Vietnamitself, it is a poor and terrible place now -- worse than when we came, run bya bunch of people so stupid they still believe in communism.;    Actually,they probably don't believe in it anymore, but they are trying to keep itgoing on the understandable grounds that without communism there are noPolitburo jobs for them. Without American intervention, Southeast Asiancommunism would almost certainly have run its course as surely as EasternEuropean communism.;    And what if we had won? At best, Vietnam today wouldbe something like Thailand, with the city French colonialists called Saigonbooming as Bangkok is, and contrast and strains between the prosperous newpeople of the city and the old provincialism of the countryside.;    But thatis, and was, inevitable. It will happen soon anyway -- as soon as the U.S.government lifts trade embargoes and the world rushes in for cheap, trainablelabor -- and might have happened much earlier if we had stayed home in the1960s.;    Now when it does happen, the money won't be made by the French, whocolonized Vietnam as part of what they called Indochina, or by the Americans,who sacrificed their young men there, but by the Japanese, who are justwaiting to exploit the low wage rates and pent-up consumer demand of the 60million energetic people of the country.;    It's hard to tell we were everthere. Vines and trees and weeds are growing through the fences and windows ofthe abandoned American Embassy in the center of the city. We probably savedthe billions of dollars we would have spent to maintain the embassy and remakeVietnam in our own image.;    And what if we win in Arabia?;    Perhaps ourtanks and our works will not be covered by the sand of the Middle East as theyare by the jungles of Southeast Asia. Perhaps, but I doubt it. The cities andtribes of the desert have too much history for us to change it in a few daysor weeks or decades. With luck we might manage to shift some future oilprofits back from bad old sheiks to good old multinational oil companies.;   Maybe, too, we can give Israel a little historical space, a little breathingtime between military confrontations with the Arabs to absorb immigrants fromthe Soviet Union. But thinking we can control events in either Israel orArabia for very long is even nuttier than thinking we could &quot;save&quot; India byfighting in Vietnam.;    In the end, with our diplomats barely escaping inhelicopters, we could not stop the minority of Vietnamese who were communistsfrom taking over their own country. It's hard, then, for me to believe that wecan stop Arabs in the desert. If we succeed in destroying Saddam Hussein andhis Iraq, we would almost certainly find ourselves trying to hold lines in therearranged political and military sand against Arab leaders as bad in Syriaand non-Arabs in Iran who may be even worse. At least we thought the Iranianswere worse when we helped Saddam Hussein get weapons to use against Iran,which now may be used against us.;    If there is a new lesson to be learnedin Southeast Asia, from seeing the place these days, it is that economicembargoes and sanctions against Vietnam and Cambodia have been far moresuccessful in isolating (or crippling) those countries (or Cuba) than ourmilitary actions ever were.;    Forgetting what we lost at home between 1960and 1975, what did we gain in Vietnam? The perverse satisfaction of watchingthe region collapse economically. And we got some talented immigrants and goodrestaurants. I doubt we'll do even that well if we win in Arabia.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  RICHARD REEVES  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910116  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  DRAWING  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  888  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday January 16, 199100016092,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
