The backshell elements      are assembled to an electrical connector, without cable/connector      disassembly. The stress relief backshell prevents stress from affecting      the connection between the cable elements and the connector and thus      causing a gap in the connection. The backshell assembly includes two      backshell halves with ring shaped front portions for engaging and gripping      the cable end of the connector, ears extending rearward along the cable,      and clamp members which clamp to the ears compressing the cable      therebetween. This divided backshell assembly thus allows backshells to be      easily removed and replaced. Backshell assemblies may be manufactured in      both straight and angled configurations. </PAL></ABST><GOVT> <PAC>  STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST </PAC><PAR>  The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the      Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes      without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor. </PAR></GOVT><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  (1) Field of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  The present invention relates to stress relief backshells for cable      connectors and more particularly to a backshell assembly in both angled      and straight configurations which can be easily removed and replaced      without disassembling the connector. </PAR><PAR>  (2) Description of the Prior Art </PAR><PAR>  Stress relief backshell assemblies are well known in the art. The purpose      of these assemblies is to prevent separation of cable element wires from      connector assemblies caused by cable tension or bending. The weakest point      in a multi-element electrical cable is where the cable elements are      connected to a termination device or to another cable. Any tension in the      cable may cause uncoupling of cable elements from the connector, and a      corresponding loss of data or power transfer. Likewise, bending of a cable      near one of its attached connectors causes tension in the outer elements      of the cable resulting in possible element separation from the connector      and loss of electrical contact. </PAR><PAR>  Backshell assemblies were devised to allow stress due to tension or bending      to be transmitted away from the joint between the cable and connector by      the connector and backshell instead of by the cable elements. Present      backshells commonly have a ring-shaped front portion which engages the      connector, two ear portions extending from the front portion rearward      along the cable away from the connector, two clamp members, positioned at      the end of the ear portions away from the connector, for compressing the      cable therebetween at the distal end of the ear portions, and fasteners to      tighten the clamp members against the cable. When the cable/connector      assembly is placed in tension, friction between the backshell clamp and      the cable transmits stress from the cable/clamp joint directly to the      connector assembly. This stress transmission through the backshell acts to      maintain slack in the cable at the connection between the elements and the      connector thereby preventing detachment. When a cable is bent at or near      the connection, the backshell absorbs the bending stress by providing a      rigid structure from the clamp to the connector. </PAR><PAR>  Present stress relief backshells are available in many configurations and      sizes. Variations on the basic design include a widened front ring portion      extending along the cable to provide protection from compression and      friction and an angled front ring portion or angled ears to accommodate a      bend in the cable near the connection. Backshells are available for many      kinds of connectors, including multi-element, coaxial, and telephone      cables. </PAR><PAR>  The disadvantage of prior art circular backshells is that if the      configuration of the cable changes and an angled backshell is needed, the      connector must be disassembled and removed from the end of the cable. The      prior art backshell must be inserted over the end of the cable and the      connector then must be reassembled to the cable elements. Reassembly of      the connector involves insertion and electrical connection of a plurality      of wires or cable elements into apertures on the rear side of the      connector. Disassembling and assembling a cable connector joint can take      up to six hours. Eliminating the need to remove connectors when changing      the configuration of a cable saves a great deal of time and labor      particularly in a research and development environment. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Accordingly, it is a general purpose and object of the present invention to      provide a stress relief means for relieving stress caused by tension and      bending of a cable at or near the connection between a cable and a      connector. </PAR><PAR>  It is a further object that such stress relief means be installable and      removable without disconnecting or disassembling the connection. </PAR><PAR>  It is yet another object that such stress relief means be available in both      angled and straight configurations. </PAR><PAR>  These objects are accomplished with the present invention by providing a      stress relief backshell which can be installed around the cable at the      joint between the cable and connector rather than having to pass over the      cable end. Such passage over the cable end requires disassembly when the      cable has already been attached to a connector. To accomplish this      installation the stress relief backshell is made in two halves, each half      having a ring portion and an ear portion. The ring portion of each half is      positioned on each side of the end of the connector nearest the cable and      fastened together so as to grip the cable end of the connector. Clamps are      then fastened to the distal ends of the ear portions on each backshell      half thus compressing the cable between the clamps. The backshell can be      removed from the cable connector by removing the clamps and fasteners and      splitting the backshell halves. The terminal cable connector thus does not      need to be detached or disassembled from the cable. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  A more complete understanding of the invention and many of the attendant      advantages thereto will be readily appreciated as the invention becomes      better understood by reference to the following detailed description when      considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 shows an exploded perspective view of a two piece stress relief      backshell according to the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 shows a plan view of a connector with the two piece stress relief      backshell of FIG. 1 assembled thereto; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 shows an exploded perspective view of an alternate embodiment of the      two piece stress relief backshell of FIG. 1 adapted for an angled      connection; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 shows an exploded perspective view of an alternate embodiment of a      two piece stress relief backshell having the ring-shaped front portion      split into two halves at a location on the periphery thereof remote from      the location where the ears are formed. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </PAC><PAR>  Referring now to FIG. 1 there is shown an exploded view of a stress relief      backshell assembly 10 according to the present invention. A connector 12      is joined to a cable 14 having a plurality of cable elements 16 which may      be wires, optical fibers or the like. Connector 12 has an outside diameter      much greater than the outside diameter of cable 14. Backshell stress      relief assembly 10, comprising two identical backshell halves 18 and two      identical arcuate clamp members 20, is affixed to the cable side of      connector 12 with cable 14 passing therebetween. Each backshell half 18      comprises two ear portions 24 parallel to each other and extending along      cable 14 away from connector 12, a semicircular front portion 26 having a      threaded inner surface 28, and two eye-tabs, a clearance eye-tab 30 and a      threaded eye-tab 32 extending radially from front portion 26. Eye-tab 30      has a clearance aperture 30a therein and therethrough. Eye-tab 32 has a      threaded aperture 32a therein and therethrough. Clearance eyetab 30 is      disposed at one end of the semicircle, and threaded eye-tab 32 is disposed      at the other end of the semicircle. Each ear portion 24 has a clamp      aperture 34 at its end away from front portion 26, the axis of clamp      aperture 34 being oriented transversely to the longitudinal axis of      combined front portions 26 and parallel to the axis of clamp aperture 34      at the extremity of other ear portion 24. Each clamp member 20 is a      rectangular plate shaped to have an arched portion at its center of a      diameter matching the cable to be secured and flat portions at the      extremities with clamp member apertures 36 and 38 disposed therein and      therethrough. Clamp member aperture 36 has a diameter sized to provide      clearance for a bolt 40 while clamp member aperture 38 on each member 20      is preferably threaded to receive bolts 40 joining members 20 to      respective ear portions 24 although clamp member aperture 38 may be an      unthreaded clearance size and instead a nut (not shown) may be employed in      cooperation with bolts 40. </PAR><PAR>  The backshell assembly components can be made from any material with      sufficient strength an desired machining characteristics. The preferred      material is aluminum; however, steel or other metal material may be used      as well as non-metallic materials. </PAR><PAR>  Backshell halves 18 are fastened on either side of connector 12, the      threaded inner surface 28 thereof engaging the external thread 42 on the      cable end of connector 12. It is recognized that another structure such as      an annular tongue and groove (as shown in FIG. 4) can also be used to      provide the same function as threaded inner surface 28 and threaded      connector 42. The backshell halves 18 are held together by bolts 44      extending through clearance diameter eye-tab aperture 30a on first      backshell half 18 and engaging the threading inside corresponding threaded      eye-tab aperture 32a On second backshell half 18. Clamp members 20 are      affixed on either side of cable 14 at the distal end of ear portions 24 by      bolts 40. A first bolt 40 joins first clamp member 20 through clamp member      aperture 36 then through clamp aperture 34 in ear portion 24 on first      backshell half 18, through clamp aperture 34 in ear portion 24 on second      backshell half 18 and engaging second clamp member 20 at threaded clamp      member aperture 38, the two ear portions 24 forming an ear. Likewise, the      clamp member aperture 36 in second clamp member 20 is joined by second      bolt 40 through clamp apertures 34 with ear portions 24 on each backshell      half 18 and first clamp member 20 at threaded clamp member aperture 38.      When clamp members 20 are affixed to ear portions 24 the arched portions      of clamp members 20 are selected so as to form an opening with average      diameter slightly less than that of cable 14 resulting in the compression      of cable 14 between clamp members 20. </PAR><PAR>  The compression created when clamp members 20 are tightened against cable      14 maintains the slack provided in cable 14 between clamp members 20 and      connector 12. Ears 24 and clamp members 20 prevent transmission of bending      stress or tension experienced by cable 14 to the joint between cable 14      and connector 12. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 shows a plan view of connector 12 with the two piece stress relief      backshell 10 of FIG. 1 assembled thereto. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 shows an exploded view of an angled backshell stress relief assembly      46 having an extension portion 48 extending from front portion 18.      Extension portion 48 is affixed to front portion 18 at a preselected bend      of angle .theta. chosen to accommodate the intended cable deployment      angle. Angle .theta.0 generally varies between 0 and 90 degrees. As shown,      extension portion 48 has additional sets of eye-tabs 30 and 32 with      corresponding apertures 30a and 32a therein placed at preselected      intervals to preserve contact between backshell halves 18 in the assembled      state. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 shows an exploded view of an alternate embodiment 10' of the two      piece backshell of FIG. 1 with the semicircular front portion 26 halves      being separated at a preselected angular distance from ears 24', e.g., 90      degrees. In this embodiment, each backshell half 18 has only one ear 24'      with a clamp aperture 34 through the distal end thereof. Backshell halves      18 are fastened on either side of connector 12, an annular tongue      structure 28' on the inner surface thereof engaging an annular groove 42'      on the cable end of connector 12. As an alternate feature, the internal      surface of backshell halves 18 and the external surface of connector 12      can be threaded as in FIG. 1 to provide the same function. Backshell      halves 18 are held together by bolts 44 extending through clearance      eye-tab aperture 30a on first backshell half 18 and engaging threading      inside corresponding threaded eye-tab aperture 32a on second backshell      half 18. Clamp members 20 are affixed in much the same manner as in FIG.      1, being disposed on either side of cable 14 by bolts 40 extending through      first clamp member aperture 36, through clamp aperture 34 and engaging      second clamp member aperture 38. This embodiment is easier to manufacture      because of the one piece ears 24' which are split in the embodiment shown      in FIG. 1. </PAR><PAR>  The main advantage of the present invention over the prior art is that      stress relief is provided by a backshell assembly that can be easily      removed and replaced. The backshell can be separated and removed without      removing or disconnecting the connector when the user needs to replace a      straight backshell with an angled backshell or to replace a corroded or      damaged backshell. </PAR><PAR>  What has thus been described is stress relief backshell assembly made in      two halves in order that it may be affixed to a cable connector without      disassembling the attached cable from the connector. </PAR><PAR>  Obviously many modifications and variations of the present invention may      become apparent in light of the above teachings. For example: as      previously recited, the semicircular front portion of the backshell may be      divided between the ear portions as in FIG. 4 rather than at the ear      portions as in FIGS. 1-3; the front portion may also be lengthened as      desired to protect the cable against compression and friction; backshell      assemblies may be made in a wide variety of sizes and styles to      accommodate different diameters and types of cables; backshell assemblies      may be angled at or along the ear portion or the front portion; the      backshell assembly may be made with an angle greater than ninety degrees;      no threading is required in the eye-tabs, instead nuts may be used to      fasten bolts through the eye-tabs; any front portion of a backshell may      engage a connector with an annular tongue and groove structure as in FIG.      4 vice threads as in FIGS. 1 and 3; and a backshell assembly may be made      of any other material with sufficient strength, machinability and      rigidity, such as another metal, an elastomer or a composite. </PAR><PAR>  In light of the above, it is therefore understood that within the scope of      the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as      specifically described. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
