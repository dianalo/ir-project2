This paper describes theirproposed organisation into a unified semi-integrated system. To providethe required efficiency and flexibility, the data will be grouped intovarious structures, optimised with respect to their functionality. Interactivedatabases are the primary source of information; these will also allowrelational access to the archive of the control system. Live data structures,initialized from the interactive data, allow simultaneous manipulationof three independent representations of the accelerator (reference, currentand target machines). A user-friendly access to the control system entitiesis provided by a Data Dictionary.</TEXT></DOC>
