It isn't marking time, butthe number of Indian babies born.   After a minute, the clock hits 50. Within an hour, 3,000. Byday's end, 72,000 babies are born, 70,000 of them survive. At theyear's end, 17 million.   ``It's like adding another Australia,'' said Ashish Bose, apopulation expert and outspoken critic of the Health and FamilyWelfare Ministry, the godfather of India's birth control program.   Ironically, India was the among the first to launch agovernment-sponsored family planning program. Since 1951, when theprogram was set up, the government has tried almost everything tocheck population growth, from cafeteria-like clinics distributingcontraceptives to coercion during the 1975-77 state of emergency.   More than $1.8 billion has been pumped into family planningprograms in the past decade, three times the amount of the previous30 years. But India's population has still mushroomed to 880million, and the rapidly multiplying numbers are the single biggestfactor inhibiting economic and social development.   According to government demographers, Indian's average annualpopulation growth peaked in 1981 at 2.25 percent and has sincedeclined to 2.12 percent.   But even at the current rate, the government's planningcommission predicted, India's population will hit 1 billion by theturn of the century and rise to 1.7 billion by the year 2035,probably surpassing China as the world's most populous country.   Already India is twice as densely populated as China, which has1.2 billion people. The pressure is intolerable on the environment,cities and basic services like water and electricity.   Earlier this year, the planning commission spelled out thedangers of unchecked population growth, citing falling foodproduction, environmental damage, rising illiteracy andunemployment and worsening social tensions.   Such apocalyptic visions have little impact.   ``Doomsday warnings don't go down in India because of theirphilosophy of life and what they have gone through,'' said GeorgeWalmsley of the United Nation's Population Fund.   Family planning got a bad name in India during the mid-1970swhen allegations of forced sterilizations caused a scandal and abacklash that still lingers.   When Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi took the helm in 1984, hisgovernment launched new programs with catchy slogans. Every year800 million condoms are distributed in India and up to 5 millionmen and women are sterilized. But after five years, there has beenno sign of dramatic change.   Opposition politicians trying to oust Gandhi and his CongressParty in this month's parliamentary elections have lofty proposalsbut shy away from discussing them.   ``Talking about family planning is like singing the requiem at awedding,'' said one opposition lawmaker, speaking on condition ofanonymity. ``If people don't want to adopt family planning and Iforce them, then I'm finished.''   The problems go much deeper than the lack of public enthusiasmand manpower to implement a comprehensive family program inethnically and linguistically diverse India.   Religious customs, traditions and teachings in theHindu-dominated country reject the very concept of family planning.Most people believe the birth of a child is a gift from God andthat to do anything against the natural course would displease God.   Male superiority and the importance of a son also are factors.   ``I need two sons. Otherwise, who will carry on the family name,who will help me in the fields, who will look after me in my oldage and who will lift my funeral pyre?'' said Datta Mal Jain in hisvillage in Rajasthan state.   Additional hands to work mean additional income for impoverishedpeople, who do not know how many of their children will survive.One out of every 10 Indian babies dies within the first year oftetanus, diarrhea, diphtheria or whooping cough.   Improved health services and eradication of famines and majorepidemics have lowered the country's overall mortality rate. Theaverage Indian now lives to the age of 58, compared with 32 whenIndia became independent from Britain in 1947.   But overall statistics disguise huge differences between regions.   The southern state of Kerala, where literacy and women's statusare high, has the lowest growth rate in the country at 1.53percent, while northern Haryana state is the highest at 2.56.   Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan in the north and MadhyaPradesh in central India also have exploding populations coupledwith some of the country's worst poverty and social conditions.   India's social and religious traditions subordinating women arestrongest in these states. Infant mortality is high, femaleliteracy, employment and marriage age are low, and acceptance offamily planning is poor.   Before the sterilization scandal, 80 percent of operations werecarried out on men. Today 80 percent are on women.   Male vasectomies are quicker, safer and cheaper than femalesterilization but men have passed the buck, and sensitivities overthe past mean the issue is not forced, Bose said.   ``We have to find a way to play God but do it soberly,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
