Birnbaum (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><TEXT>   Congressional candidate Dave Moss of Arizona has a dream -- or is he just dreaming?    The 64-year-old Mr. Moss is running against six-term GOP congressman Bob Stump with a stump speech that many of the state's residents find bewildering. His proposal: transform the sleepy border town of Yuma, Ariz., into a bustling international seaport by building a navigable canal from there to the Sea of Cortez in the Gulf of California.    &quot;It is the most important part of my campaign,&quot; says Mr. Moss, a Democrat, who has run unsuccessfully for governor of Arizona twice.    Of course, there are a few problems. &quot;Even those who believe that Arizona is the center of the universe would concede that seaports are unnatural here in the desert,&quot; says D. Michael Rappoport, an assistant general manager of the Salt River Project in Phoenix and an expert in regional water issues.    For another thing, almost the entire length of the proposed 50-plus mile canal -- about the same length as the one in Panama -- wouldn't be in Arizona at all. It would be in Mexico. But Mr. Moss doesn't see that as a problem. &quot;It will help wipe out their debt, help Arizona with our export business and will help out the entire nation,&quot; Mr. Moss claims.    Finally, there is the fact that even the small part of the canal that would be in the U.S. wouldn't be in the congressional district that Mr. Moss wants to represent. Instead, it would be in the neighboring district represented by Rep. Morris Udall.    Did we mention the cost? Extrapolating from the more than $300 million it cost the U.S. to build the Panama Canal, Mr. Moss estimates that the Yuma waterway would cost about $6 billion. &quot;In these days of fewer public-works projects, I would think (it's) a long shot-speaking generously,&quot; says Robert A. Neuman, the administrative assistant to Rep. Udall.    Adds Jack DeBolske, executive director of the League of Arizona Cities and Towns: &quot;I would be very skeptical that anything like that could be done.&quot;    State Sen. Jones Osborn, who represents Yuma, is skeptical too. Trying to be charitable to his fellow Democrat, he describes the canal idea as &quot;something to talk about on the campaign trail. You know how we politicians are.&quot;    Still, Mr. Moss believes that talking about the canal will be just the thing to unseat Mr. Stump. &quot;With my big mouth,&quot; he says, &quot;I think I can beat the man.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
