In March, Los Angeles-based Hughes agreed to pay $3.6million in criminal and civil penalties as part of a pleaagreement in which it admitted using a pair of classifiedfive-year Pentagon budget plans in 1984.</LP><TEXT>   Hughes, a unit of General Motors Corp., said it received aletter about the proposed debarment last week. &quot;Once youreceive the notice, you are placed on suspension while youmeet with the Air Force to go over what changes you have madeto rectify the situation,&quot; said a company spokesman.   The Pentagon has the authority to bar Hughes fromreceiving any new federal contracts for up to three years.&quot;We're under review now; it's up to the Air Force to decide&quot;how long the suspension continues, the spokesman said.   An Air Force spokesman said in Washington that thesuspension covers engineering, research and certain otheroperations at the Canoga Park, Calif., facility of thecompany's missile-making group. Since those operations don'tdirectly hold or compete for military contracts, he said thesuspension isn't expected to have any impact on the company'scurrent operations.   But if the Air Force eventually imposes the more stringentpunishment it has proposed, the impact on Hughes could besignificant. Engineers, scientists and others at the facilitycould be barred from working on some or all of Hughes' futuremilitary work. The company has until early June to make itscase to a special Air Force board.   There's a good chance, however, that Hughes will escapelong-term pain. In the past, Pentagon officials have beenunwilling to bar major contractors from new contracts.Moreover, none of the other firms convicted in thedocument-swapping case have been hit with long-termsanctions.   As part of the company's plea agreement last month,prosecutors said that the company cooperated with theinvestigation and that General Motors, which acquired Hughesin 1985, didn't participate in or benefit from the illegalactivity. Such language typically has protected contractorsfrom Pentagon punishment.</TEXT></DOC>
