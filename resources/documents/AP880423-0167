Belonogov also called the slaying ``another act of the policy ofstate terrorism which has long been practiced by Israel.''   Tunisia, which requested the council meeting, wants Israelcondemned for the assassination of Khalil Wazir at his home insuburban Tunis last Saturday.   Tunisian officials and Israeli sources say Israeli commandosgunned down Wazir, also known as Abu Jihad. Officially, Israel hasneither confirmed nor denied the allegations.   In a carefully worded statement issued Thursday by the Israelimission to the United Nations, the Jewish state denied it``admitted'' the attack, as Tunisia claimed.   The Soviets joined a growing list of nations condemning Israelfor the assassination. Most have singled it out by name. A few,such as Britain and France, have not.   Japan's ambassador, Hideo Kagami, noted the absence of firmproof against Israel. Kagami said any condemnation ``must be basedon solid and irrefutable evidence.''   Many diplomats said they expected United States to vetoTunisia's resolution, as it has several resolutions on the unrestconsidered by the council recently.   They said the U.S. vote hinged on the wording of the resolution.A direct condemnation of Israel was sure to be vetoed, but ageneral condemnation of political assassination might survive, saidthe diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   A vote was expected Monday. Dozens of nations have joined thedebate, including many accused of sponsoring terrorism, such asLibya.   Many speakers told the council the slaying further hampers theprospects of a settlement between Israel and Arab neighbors.   ``The shots in Tunisia are shots against peace in the MiddleEast,'' said Yugoslav Ambassador Dragoslav Pejic.   A number of speakers told Israel that Wazir's death will not endthe Palestinian unrest since Dec. 8 in the occupied West Bank andGaza Strip that has left 171 Palestinians and two Israelis dead.   Wazir, who grew up in the Gaza Strip, was the PLO coordinatorfor the uprising.   The PLO has issued orders for a ``Day of Rage'' in theIsraeli-occupied terrorities Saturday to avenge Wazir, according toa leaflet circulating in the area.</TEXT></DOC>
