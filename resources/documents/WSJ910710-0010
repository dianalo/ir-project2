The Japan Air Lines Flight Crew Union's partial strikeforced the airline to cancel 19 domestic and fourinternational flights on Tuesday, more than 10% of its dailyschedule. More than 3,000 passengers were stranded or put onother airlines.</LP><TEXT>   Akira Ninagawa, a spokesman for the airline, said theunion abandoned the cockpit to protest the addition of 180foreign pilots, co-pilots and engineers to its current rosterof about 2,600 crew members. Only 63 crew members now arenon-Japanese, he said. The union also objects to theairline's use of only two crew members in Boeing 747-400long-range jumbo jets, which are designed to operate withouta flight engineer. Other jetliners require a crew of three.   Union officials said they weren't opposed to hiringforeigners per se, but they worried that taking new crewmembers too rapidly will interfere with the company's abilityto operate its aircraft safely.   A senior Japan Air Lines official said many of thecompany's pilots harbor memories of the crash of a Japan AirLines DC-8 cargo flight in Anchorage, Alaska, on Jan. 13,1977. Three of the five crew members on that flight, all ofwhom were killed, weren't Japanese.   The suggestion that U.S. pilots might not meet Japanesesafety standards prompted a sharp reaction from a spokesmanat the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, who said: &quot;The outstandingsafety record of American pilots and American-made aircraftspeaks for itself.&quot; He said he had no further comment on thelabor dispute.   The Japan Air Lines spokesman, Mr. Ninagawa, alsodismissed such suggestions. &quot;All foreign airlines areoperated by foreign crews,&quot; he said. &quot;It doesn't make anydifference.&quot;   He said the only substantive issue involved in hiringadditional flight crews is whether the airline would be ableto provide sufficient ground support for flights it wants toadd at Japan's three major airports in Tokyo and near Osaka.He said the company believes it can.   Besides, the foreign pilots -- who already have U.S.flight certifications -- will receive several months of freshtraining once they are hired. It takes more than 10 years oftraining to bring a fresh Japanese pilot up to captain'sstatus at Japan Air Lines.   The union agreed to suspend its strike after one day, butreached no settlement with the airline. Unions in Japan oftenuse temporary work stoppages to put pressure on management toagree to changes in negotiations.   The one-day strike isn't likely to have much materialeffect on the airline. Last year, Japan Air Lines flew morethan 22 million passengers, earning more than 59 billion yen($425.8 million) before taxes on revenue of 1.26 trillionyen.</TEXT></DOC>
