The newspaper quoted Sheik Abdel Amir Kabalan, the Shiites' topreligious judge, as saying the ban was included in a peace pactreached by the rival militias in Damascus, Syria last week.   ``Foreigners should have a role in Lebanon,'' Kabalan was quotedas saying.   ``It is impermissible for anyone from now on to kidnap anyforeigner, because the accord calls for preserving the UnitedNations peacekeeping forces and the foreign humanitarianorganizations,'' he added.   One of the hostages is U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins,who was kidnapped Feb. 17, 1988 while serving as chief of anobserver group attached to U.N. peacekeeping forces in Lebanon.   Kabalan, who heads Amal's religious affairs department, was amember of its delegation to the Damascus talks.   The peace accord halted a nine-month war between the pro-SyrianAmal and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, in whichmore than 500 people were killed.   The two factions were fighting for control of Lebanon's 1 millionShiites, who make up the country's largest single sect.   Kabalan was quoted as saying the Damascus talks did not addressthe issue of the 15 foreigners missing in Lebanon.   ``In fact, I haven't witnessed any talks about the hostages. Thisissue has a separate approach like the one that led to the releaseof the French, West German and Korean hostages,'' Kabalan was quotedas saying. He did not elaborate.   The hostages are nine Americans, three Britons, an Irishman, anItalian and a Belgian. The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson,chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He waskidnapped March 16, 1985.   Hezbollah is the umbrella for pro-Iranian extremist groupsholding most of the hostages.   The Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War group, freed three Frenchhostages May 4, reportedly as part of a deal to improve France'srelations with Iran.   Two West Germans also were freed last year in an apparent effortto secure lenient verdicts for Shiite brothers Mohammed Ali andAbbas Hamadi, who are held in Germany.   Abbas Hamadi, 28, was sentenced in April to 13 years in prison oncharges of kidnapping the West Germans in an attempt to gain thefreedom of his brother.   Mohammed Ali, 23, is standing trial on charges of air piracy andmurder in connection with the 1985 TWA hijacking in which U.S. Navydiver Robert Stetham was killed.   The only South Korean hostage held in Lebanon was Do Chae-Sung,46, who was second secretary at the South Korean Embassy in Beirutwhen he was kidnapped in 1986. He was freed Oct. 26, 1987 amidreports that a hefty ransom was paid.   The South Korean government denied making any payment.   Kidnappings of foreigners serving with humanitarian organizationsprompted the International Committee of the Red Cross to shut downits operations in Lebanon in December.</TEXT></DOC>
