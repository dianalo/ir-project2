U.S. direct investmentabroad is defined as the ownership or control, directly or indirectly,by one U.S. person of 10 percent or more of the voting securities of anunincorporated foreign business enterprise or an equivalent interest inan unincorporated foreign business enterprise, including a branch.The purpose of the benchmark survey is to obtain universe data on the financialand operating characteristics of, and on positions and transactions between,U.S. parent companies and their foreign affiliates. The data from the surveyare needed to measure the size of U.S. direct investment abroad, monitorchange in such investment, assess its impact on the U.S. and foreign economies,and, based upon this assessment, make informed policy decisions regardingU.S. direct investment abroad. The data will provide benchmarks for derivingcurrent universe estimates of direct investment from sample data collectedin other BEA surveys in nonbenchmark years. In particular, they will serveas benchmarks for the quarterly direct investment estimates included inthe U.S. international transactions and gross national product accounts,and for annual estimates of the U.S. direct investment position abroadand of the operations of U.S. parent companies and their foreign affiliates.The benchmark surveys are also the most comprehensive of BEA's surveysin terms of subject matter in order that they obtain the detailed informationon U.S. direct investment abroad needed for policy purposes. As specifiedin the Act, policy areas of particular interest include, among other things,trade in both goods and services, employment and employee compensation,taxes, and technology.As proposed, the survey will consist of an instruction booklet, a claimfor not filing the BE-10, and the following report forms:1. Form BE-10A for reporting by a U.S. Reporter that is not a bank;2. Form BE-10A BANK for reporting by a U.S. Reporter that is a bank;3. Form BE-10B(LF) (Long Form) for reporting ``large'' nonbank foreignaffiliates of nonbank parents (those with assets, sales, or net income<T3>outside</T3> the range of negative $15 million to positive $15 million);4. Form BE-10B(SF) (Short Form) for reporting ``small'' nonbank foreignaffiliates of nonbank parents (those with assets, sales, or net income<T3>outside </T3>the range of negative $3 million to positive $3 millionbut <T3>within </T3>the range of negative $15 million to positive $15 million)and all nonbank affiliates of bank parents with assets, sales, or net income<T3>outside </T3>the range of negative $3 million to positive $3 million;and5. Form BE-10B BANK for foreign affiliates that are banks and that haveassets, sales, or net income <T3>outside </T3>the range of negative $3 million to positive $3 million.Although the proposed survey is intended to cover the universe of U.S.direct investment abroad, in order to minimize the reporting burden, foreignaffiliates with assets, sales, and net income <T3>within </T3>the range of negative $3 million to positive $3 millionwould not have to be reported on Form BE-10B(SF) or BANK (but would belisted on Form BE-10A SUPPLEMENT).In designing the survey, BEA had extensive discussions with representativesof both survey respondents and data users. BEA held meetings with a TaskForce of the Business Council on the Reduction of Paperwork (BCORP) onDecember 13, 1988 and March 31, 1989. It held meetings with interagencydata users on December 8, 1988, and January 10, February 16, and March13, 1989. In addition, it solicited input from other businesses and fromnongovernment data users. The proposed draft incorporates the commentsreceived. In reaching decisions on what questions to include in the survey,BEA considered the Government's need for the data, the burden imposed onrespondents, the quality of the likely responses (e.g., whether the dataare readily available on respondents' books), and its experience in previousbenchmark surveys.Two change from the 1982 survey to the 1989 survey, which are reflectedin these proposed rules, are:1. To minimize the reporting burden on respondents and the processing burdenon BEA, a short form for reporting ``small'' nonbank foreign affiliatesof nonbank parents and all nonbank foreign affiliates of bank parents hasbeen introduced. In the 1982 benchmark survey, all nonbank foreign affiliateshad to be reported on what was the equivalent of the long form. Introductionof the short form will significantly reduce the burden of reporting smalleraffiliates.2. The due date for U.S. Reporters with 50 or more reportable foreign affiliatesis June 29, 1990. The due date for all other U.S. Reporters is May 31,1990. In the 1982 survey, three different due dates were used, dependingon the number of foreign affiliates a U.S. Reporter had, and the dateswere stretched out over a longer period. The need to compress, and reducethe number of, due dates reflects demands by data users for survey resultsto be available on a more timely basis. Several companies suggested thatan early look at the survey questions would aid them in preparing for thebenchmark survey. BEA plans to mail to all U.S. Reporters with 20 or morereportable foreign affiliates a draft copy of the BE-10 report forms assoon as possible after the forms have been approved by the Office of Managementand Budget (OMB). This should be in early January 1990. Mailout of theprinted forms is scheduled for March 1, 1990.Other proposed changes in the survey from 1982 to 1989 include revisionof the instructions_primarily for purposes of clarification_and modification,addition, deletion, or combination of some items on the forms. These changes,which, on balance, should result in a net reduction in reporting burden,do not require changes in the rules.Copies of the proposed survey forms may be obtained from: Office of theChief, International Investment Division (BE-50), Bureau of Economic Analysis,U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230; phone (202) 523-0659.In addition to revising 15 CFR 806.16 to set forth the reporting requirementsfor the 1989 benchmark survey, this proposed rulemaking would amend 15CFR 806.14 to change the year of coverage of this next benchmark surveyfrom 1987 to 1989. The original legislation authorizing the survey requiredthat a benchmark survey be conducted at least once every 5 years. Becausea benchmark survey covering 1982 was conducted, the original legislationwould have required that the next survey cover 1987. However, amendmentsto the original legislation made in 1981 (see Pub. L. 97-33 and Pub. L.97-70) now require the conduct of ``a benchmark survey covering year 1982,a benchmark survey covering year 1989, and benchmark surveys covering everyfifth year thereafter.''The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto vary from 14 to 8,500 hours per response, with an average of 156 hoursper response, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existingdata sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completingand reviewing the collection of information. Comments regarding the burdenestimate, including suggestions for reducing this burden, may be sent toDirector, Bureau of Economic Analysis (BE-1), U.S. Department of Commerce,Washington, DC 20230; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs,Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project 0608-0049,Washington, DC 20503.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>BEA has determined that these proposed rules are not ``major'' as definedin E.O. 12291 because they are not likely to result in:(1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;(2) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(3) Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12612</ITAG>These proposed rules do not contain policies with Federalism implicationssufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under E.O.12612.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>These proposed rules contain a collection of information requirement subjectto the Paperwork Reduction Act. A request to collect this information hasbeen submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review undersection 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act. Comments from the publicon this collection of information requirement should be addressed to: Officeof Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget,Washington, DC 20503, Attention: Desk Officer for the Department of Commerce.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>The General Counsel, Department of Commerce, has certified to the ChiefCounsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration, under provisions ofthe Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), that this proposed rulemaking,if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities because few, if any, small businesses are subjectto the reporting requirements of this survey. The exemption level is setin terms of the size of a U.S. company's foreign affiliates. If an affiliateis owned 10 percent or more by the U.S. company and has assets, sales,or net income greater than $3 million (positive or negative), it must bereported. Usually, the U.S. parent company (the one required to file thereport) is many times larger.Also, to minimize the reporting burden on small U.S. businesses, Form BE-10B(SF),the short form, has been introduced for reporting foreign affiliates withassets, sales, and net income of $15 million or less (but above $3 million).For these affiliates, far less information must be reported than for thosewith assets, sales, or net income of more than $15 million. Affiliateswith assets, sales, and net income of $3 million or less do not have tobe reported on Form BE-10B(SF), but must be listed on Form BE-10A Supplement.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 15 CFR Part 806</ITAG>Balance of payments, Economic statistics, U.S. investment abroad, Reportingand recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: August 25, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Allan H.
