The administration would prefer some sort of off-budget financingfor the Sandamp;L cleanup, but ``they're convinced one way or another thatthe Treasury has to participate,'' the official, speaking oncondition of anonymity, said Wednesday.   Kenneth Guenther, executive vice president of the IndependentBankers Association of America, a trade group, said Vice PresidentGeorge Bush's advisers are ``very seriously'' looking at creating apresidential panel to control rescue expenditures.   In thrift rescues to date, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,which regulates Sandamp;Ls, has been criticized for making open-endedguarantees to private investors taking over failed institutions andfor not requiring the investors to risk more of their own money.   Guenther said the structure of the new board would be similar tothe one created this year to oversee the bailout of the Farm CreditSystem.   The administration official confirmed that the option was beingconsidered by the Treasury staff, but said, ``I don't think they'vereached any conclusions yet.''   ``Essentially it says, `We'll give you the money, but we wantsome control','' the official said.   In the rescue of the Farm Credit System, which provides loans tofarmers, Congress guaranteed the system's borrowing and provided aline of credit to the Treasury. However, it required that athree-member panel including the secretaries of the Treasury andagriculture approve bailout expenditures.   The official also confirmed a report published Wednesday in TheWashington Post, which said the administration plan would require$20 billion to $30 billion a year for three years.   An acknowledgment that taxpayer money is required would representa shift in policy. Bank board Chairman M. Danny Wall has maintainedthat the savings industry could continue to pay for rescuing failedinstitutions, although only if a special fee on healthy institutionscontinued for 30 years.   Treasury Undersecretary George Gould has said there is a limit towhat the industry can pay but he has not said yet if the problemexceeds it.   Gould did not return a telephone call seeking comment Wednesday.Treasury Department spokesman Arthur Siddon declined to comment onthe task force's work. Karl Hoyle, a bank board spokesman, said Wallwas traveling and could not be reached immediately.   The savings and loan crisis is shaping up as one of the chiefchallenges facing Bush. The bank board estimates it will cost up to$50 billion to close or merge failed institutions. Private analystsput the cost as high as $100 billion.   According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insurescommercial banks, Sandamp;L losses are growing at a rate of $15 billion ayear.   The need for potentially huge expenditures comes at a time whenforeign investors, who buy much of the U.S. government's debt, aredemanding that Bush, who pledged not to raise taxes, reduce thebudget deficit.   The Treasury task force formulating the administration's positionis looking to complete its work next month.   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who will continue in hisposition in the Bush administration, ordered the review shortlyafter taking office in September.   Robert R. Glauber, the Harvard business school professor who wasstaff director for the stock market crash study that Brady conductedlast year for President Reagan, heads the task force.</TEXT></DOC>
