(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael Dukakis today began a weekend awayfrom the campaign trail as he unveiled his first televisionadvertising for the general election in high-stakes Texas andCalifornia.   The Democratic presidential nominee traveled to Cape Cod Fridaynight after campaign stops in Virginia and Florida, where hedenounced Reagan administration anti-drug efforts, defensepriorities and economic policies.   The new ad, to air this weekend in the two states expected to becritical in the November election, is part of an effort by theDukakis staff to raise the candidate's profile in advance of nextweek's Republican convention.   On Friday, the economy was at the top of the nominee's agenda,with Dukakis saying Reagan's deficit spending is responsible forthe news Friday that inflation was picking up steam and for anincrease this week in interest rates.   Dukakis, in Jacksonville, Fla., told a waterfront rally theincrease in the prime rate to 10 percent was ``the consequence ofeight years of not paying our bills. ... It's an irresponsibilitytax.''   ``We deserve an explanation from the Republicans at thatconvention about what they're doing to the American people,'' hesaid.   The Massachusetts governor said the next president will have todeal with the deficit immediately if interest rates are to drop. Hestood by his promise to raise taxes only as a last resort aftermaking spending cuts, trying to increase the rate of economicgrowth and collecting unpaid taxes.   Dukakis said a higher prime rate would impose unfair hardshipson American families, farmers and businesses and increase thefederal deficit by $15 billion because of higher interest on theU.S. debt.   ``As we all know, sooner or later the bill collector comes tothe door,'' Dukakis told a breakfast rally in Richmond, Va., beforeheading to Florida.   The ad being broadcast this weekend is the first new spot theDukakis campaign has aired since the candidate was nominated lastmonth in Atlanta.   The airing is in states shaping up as two major battlegroundsfor Dukakis and Vice President George Bush. California leads thenation with 47 electoral votes and Texas has 29.   The 60-second piece features several clips of Dukakis'acceptance speech at the Democratic convention and credits Dukakiswith helping create more than 400,000 jobs in Massachusetts.   ``It wasn't a miracle,'' the narrator says. ``It wasleadership.''   The ad was scheduled to run in Houston and California's citiesof Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, Sacramento and Fresno.   Dukakis also will campaign during the final days of theRepublican convention, with stops tentatively scheduled in Florida,Minnesota, Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas and Texas.   He was introduced by Gov. Gerald Baliles, who said he disagreedwith Dukakis' promise to scrap plans for two supercarrier taskforces, which would be built at the Newport News, Va., shipyard.   ``Governor Dukakis and I may debate the individual choices wemust make, but in his commitment to the security of this nation, Ihave no doubts, no reservations, and no hesitations,'' Baliles said.</TEXT></DOC>
