STEICHEN</NOTE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa today saidworkers at the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk will join striking coalminers and dockworkers unless the government legalizes the tradeunion, a spokesman said.   The union's national executive commission later called on itsmembers to support the strikers, who have closed six mines insouthwestern Poland and shut down docks and public transportationin Szczecin, according to a labor leader.   ``They (the strikers) are fighting for our common cause,'' saidthe commission statement, read by Jacek Kuron, a senior unionadviser in Warsaw. ``Experience teaches us that only wise socialpressure can lead the authorities to the road of economic andsocial reconstruction.''   The strikes, which began Tuesday, are demanding Solidarity'slegalization, higher pay and improved working conditions.   Workers at a coal mine in the Silesia region today joined thestrike. Solidarity spokesman Adam Kowalczyk said about 1,000 minerswere occupying the 30th Anniversary of the People's Poland Mine.Other strikers occupied mines in Andaluzja, Moszczenica, Morcinekand two plants near Jastrzebie.   Walesa told a rally in Gdansk that shipyard workers there areprepared to stop work Monday if the strikers' demands are not met,a union spokesman said.   A strike by workers at the shipyard eight years ago led tonationwide labor unrest that spawned Solidarity. The union existedlegally for 15 months before being suppressed in a militarycrackdown in 1981 and outlawed the next year.   The Gdansk shipyard workers also went on strike in May insupport of steel workers who had shut down operations at a hugesteel mill near Krakow.   Slawomir Majewski, a Solidarity activist in Gdansk, said bytelephone that Walesa's call for a sympathy strike was met withapplause from 500 workers attending the rally.   Majewski said they chanted, ``There is no freedom withoutSolidarity!''   The strikes began Tuesday when miners occupied the JulyManifesto mine near Jastrzerbie, in southwestern Poland.   In Szczecin, Poland's second largest port, transportationworkers stopped work Thursday, joining dockworkers in the city.   The state-run PAP news agency estimated that 70,000 tons of coalhad gone unmined as a result of the miners' strikes, resulting in aloss of more than $1.7 million. It has denounced the strikes asillegal.   All the mines are in Silesia, the rich mining region ofsouthwestern Poland, and are major producers of high-grade exportcoal. Together, they employ more than 40,000 workers.   Solidarity activists estimated that 10,100 miners joined thestrikes. They said 5,000 strikers occupied the July Manifesto mine.A management spokesman put the July Manifesto figure at 800-900.   In Szczecin, 600 bus drivers and other employees of themunicipal transport service walked off the job. PAP said thewalkout stopped normal bus service and forced authorities to leasebuses to aid stranded commuters.   About 2,000 Szczecin dockworkers were on strike, said Solidarityspokesman Wojciech Maziarski.   Czeslaw Czerwiec, a spokesman for July Manifesto strikers, saidsecurity forces were hampering efforts by supporters and relativesto bring food into the mine.   Witnesses described the scene as tense, with police stillholding positions around the mine's entrances. A regional leader ofSolidarity, Wladyslaw Frasyniuk, was picked up by police in Wroclawon Thursday night, union activists said.   Miners are paid more than twice the national average but sayPoland's 60 percent inflation and nationwide price increases of 40percent this year make it impossible to get by.   Coal resources are crucial to the nation's economy. Poland isthe world's fourth-largest exporter of coal and the miningoperations are essential to its steel, power and shipbuildingindustries.   The strikes have surpassed the number of actions that broke outin April and May, the worst labor unrest in the country since the1981 martial-law crackdown. However it appeared that a smallernumber of workers were on strike than in April and May.   The spring strikes, in which workers also demanded legalizationof Solidarity and wage increases, ended inconclusively after policebroke up one strike and striking shipyard workers gave up without asettlement.</TEXT></DOC>
