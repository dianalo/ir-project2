<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-80-0084 </DOCNO><TEXT>The K/sup 0/ beam and detector used for a high-precision measurement ofthe CP-violation parameter {epsilon}' at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron(SPS) are described. The beam provides K/sub L/ and K/sub S/ alternatelythrough a common decay region. The detection of the decays is based onwire chambers and calorimeters without employing a magnet. The triggerand readout system achieve a high selectively for the suppressed, CP-violating,two-pion decays of the K/sub L/ by incorporation of hard-wired processors.The readout is based on Fastbus for maximum data rates.</TEXT></DOC>
