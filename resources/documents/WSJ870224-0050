A court in Wimbledon yesterday ordered Mr. Collier to stand trial at London's Central Criminal Court, the Old Bailey, on six allegations of insider dealing. A date wasn't set for the trial. Mr. Collier said nothing in court.    Mr. Collier, 35 years old, quit Morgan Grenfell, a subsidiary of Morgan Grenfell Group PLC, last Nov. 10 after admitting he had breached the firm's rules by making an undisclosed investment in the shares of AE. The British engineering company was the target of a takeover bid at the time by Hollis PLC, which was being advised by Morgan Grenfell. Hollis makes furniture and provides certain office services.    Three insider-trading charges alleged that Mr. Collier dealt in AE shares on or around last Nov. 3. The Department of Trade and Industry also accused Mr. Collier of insider dealing in shares of Cadbury Schweppes, a candy and soft-drink concern, on or around last Oct. 14.    Government prosecutors didn't mention Cadbury Schweppes when they served Mr. Collier with a court summons last December. The summons related to three alleged offenses under the Companies Securities (Insider Dealing) Act of 1985.    During October, General Cinema Corp. of Chestnut Hill, Mass., was acquiring Cadbury Schweppes shares with advice from Morgan Grenfell Inc. of New York, a unit of Morgan Grenfell Group. &quot;We know that General Cinema was buying into us between September and February every month without fail,&quot; said Leo Ellery, investor-relations director at Cadbury Schweppes. &quot;They were using about 18 different nominees&quot; to buy the shares, he said.    In late January, General Cinema announced that it had bought an 8.3% stake in Cadbury Schweppes. &quot;The purchases were made over a four- to five-month period,&quot; said Janine Dusossoit, investor-relations director at General Cinema in Chestnut Hill.    Mr. Collier had been a leading figure in the London securities markets. His resignation from Morgan Grenfell Securities and the government's subsequent probe stunned London's financial district. </TEXT></DOC>
