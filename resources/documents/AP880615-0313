ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   If 1987 was an off year for the nation'sretailers, 1988 bears the earmarks of disaster.   Storeowners, whose sales have run at a sluggish pace since earlylast year, have seen their results deteriorate further in recentmonths and are being forced to tighten their belts.   ``They're watching their expenses carefully; they've cut back onnew stores they open,'' said Fred Wintzer, a retail industryanalyst with the investment firm Alex. Brown andamp; Sons Inc. inBaltimore.   Robert Buchanan, an analyst with A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc. in St.Louis, estimated overall retail sales have risen 1 to 2 percent sofar this year, compared with the same period in 1987.   ``That's probably 2 percent below where retailers would haveliked to be, well below (their) plan,'' he said.   Buchanan's assessment is based on what the retail industry callssame-store sales, those from stores open for at least 12 months.Analysts say these sales provide a more accurate scale forcomparing a store's year-to-year performance than do figures thatinclude sales from newer stores.   Individual results from some of the biggest retailers supportBuchanan's estimate. The nation's largest retailer, Sears, Roebuckand Co., said its same-store sales through the end of May were up1.1 percent, while No. 2 K mart Corp. reported a 1.7 percentincrease. J.C. Penney Co. Inc. had a 1.5 percent gain, as didDayton Hudson Corp.   Some retailers reported declines: May Department Stores Co.sales fell 0.3 percent and the apparel retailer Limited Inc.suffered a 5 percent drop.   Wal-Mart Stores Inc., with a 12 percent gain, is one of the rareexceptions to the rule. Analysts attribute the discounter'senviable performance to its aggressive price discounts.   But overall, with sales increases of 2 percent or less, theindustry is losing profits _ first-quarter results were generallydisappointing _ and losing ground to inflation.   Through May, wholesale prices rose 3.4 percent, while consumerprices jumped 4.5 percent through April, according to U.S. LaborDepartment figures.   A couple of points must be kept in mind: No one, neitheranalysts nor the stores themselves, expected 1988 to be a banneryear. And, the first half of any year is not as important toretailers as the second half, which includes the back-to-school andholiday seasons.   That aside, 1988 has been terrible. Analysts say consumers havespent gingerly while they pay off high installment debt levels.   ``The year was projected to be bad and turned out worse,'' saidWintzer of Alex. Brown.   ``The head counts going into the stores haven't changed _ peopleare spending less,'' said Joseph Ronning, an analyst with BrownBrothers Harriman Inc. ``Instead of buying two items, you're buyingone.''   The problem is compounded in the women's clothing sector, wheresales have been slowed by boredom as much as frugality. Consumerswho grew disenchanted with the fashions last fall are equallyunenthused about spring and summer wear.   ``What's in the stores is competing primarily with what's inwomen's closets, and the closets are winning,'' said William Smith,an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.   After last year's disappointing sales, many retailers went into1988 with already conservative plans. For instance, Deb Shops Inc.,a chain of nearly 279 women's apparel stores, decided to open fewerlocations this year than last year, president Marvin Rounick said.   But some retailers are cutting back even further, makingadjustments in expansion programs and buying operations.   ``Building plans and store additions are being tapered down,''said Buchanan of A.G. Edwards.   The retailers tended to downplay any cutbacks, whileacknowledging that times are difficult.   Zayre Corp. has trimmed its plans to open approximately 100 newstores by one or two stores, said vice president and treasurerSteven Wishner.   ``We have not made any significant changes to our store openingplan,'' he said, but added, ``We are constantly reviewing thesituation.''   The sales decline has also made retailers take a harder lookbefore signing real estate contracts.   ``When sales get soft like this, it seems prudent to take await-and-see attitude,'' said Matt Miller, a senior vice presidentat Petrie Stores Corp., which operates more than 1,600 specialtystores.   ``We've postponed making certain deals until we get a betterfeel for the real estate outlook,'' Miller said.   Charming Shoppes Inc., with more than 850 apparel stores, hashad to consider slumping sales when deciding whether a particularlocation was affordable, said vice president Bernard Brodsky.   ``We turned down a bigger percentage of the (real estate) dealsthat were shown to us,'' Brodsky said.   Like many other retailers, Charming Shoppes has kept itsinventory low and delayed buying for the coming seasons, Brodskysaid.   ``If things had turned about in the spring, we would have beenmore positive about our buying in the fall,'' he said. ``When wesee things are doing well, we will then finish up the remainder ofour buying.''   Whether business will pick up is a matter for debate among theanalysts, in part because a hoped-for autumn recovery in apparelsales may not materialize. Monroe H. Greenstein, an analyst withBear Stearns andamp; Co., said fashions being test-marketed have failedto excite consumers.   ``It looks like for the fall, there may not be any strongfashion trend,'' he said.   Smith, the analyst at Smith Barney, was very pessimistic. ``If Ihad to guess, I'd say we write off '88,'' he said.   More upbeat was Walter Loeb, an analyst with Morgan Stanley andamp;Co.: ``The second half will be much stronger.''   ``I don't think the fashion message will be very strong, but itwill be enough of an incentive to bring customers back into thestores,'' Loeb said.   If nothing else, industry observers say, last year's resultswill make the second-half performance appear more robust.   ``You're going to have easier comparisons,'' said Ronning ofBrown Brothers.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Sunday June 19</NOTE></DOC>
