Negotiator Richard Burt discussed at length the Americanproposals offered since the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks resumedlate last month, according to a U.S. official.   The allies questioned the negotiators about such issues as mobilemissiles and sea-launched cruise missiles as well as verification,said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   Burt told the allies that any U.S.-Soviet agreement has to bebased on a ``good strong verification regime,'' the official said.   Burt and another negotiator, Henry F. Cooper, met privately withrepresentatives of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organizationin Brussels. It was the first time that Burt, the former ambassadorto West Germany, talked to the allies in his new job.   NATO's press office said the allies ``welcomed the opportunityfor confidential exchanges on developments in the Geneva talks, onthe basis of a detailed report made by the U.S. negotiators.''   The U.S.-Soviet talks, which resumed after a seven-month recess,are expected to end in early August.   President Bush has suggested Washington and Moscow begin testingverification procedures during the arms negotiations, rather thanwaiting until an agreement is wrapped up.   They could carry out trial inspections at each other's missilesites and discuss equipment needed for assuring compliance with atreaty.   The Bush proposals are designed in part to build support in theSenate for ratification of an eventual accord.   Several arms control deals, including the 1979 SALT 2 treaty onlimiting long-range nuclear arsenals, were never ratified because ofSenate concerns about adequate verification methods.   The START negotiations, which began in March 1985, are aimed atreducing U.S. and Soviet strategic or long-range bombers, missilesand nuclear submarines by 30 percent to 50 percent.   The pact is intended to cover nuclear weapons that the twosuperpowers could use to strike each other, including sea- andland-based missiles as well as heavy bombers.   In earlier rounds of talks, both sides agreed to lowered ceilingsof 6,000 nuclear wearheads and 1,600 delivery vehicles _ missilesand bombers _ for each side. Outlines of a system for monitoringcompliance were also set.</TEXT></DOC>
