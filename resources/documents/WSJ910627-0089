He has also provedto be an effective political hit man, helping to defeat thenominations of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court and BernardSiegan to the Court of Appeals. As a result he is probably,in some circles, the most hated liberal legal scholar, and hewould face the same sort of vicious opposition that blockedJudge Bork should he ever be named to the Supreme Court.   That may help explain &quot;On Reading the Constitution&quot;(Harvard University Press, 144 pages, $18.95), which Mr.Tribe wrote with a recent Harvard law graduate, Michael Dorf.The book is surprisingly moderate. For instance, Messrs.Tribe and Dorf acknowledge that Mr. Bork's record wasdistorted by some of his opponents. They also argue that drugtrafficking (carefully sidestepping the question of personaldrug use) is not protected by the right to privacy. Mr. Tribeseems to have decided to present himself as the paragon ofcentrist PCism, eschewing both Borkian original intent andBrennanesque decision-by-&quot;Zeitgeist.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The basic question the authors seek to answer is: &quot;How isit that different readers of the Constitution draw such verydifferent conclusions about its commands?&quot; At a time when thecourt seems to be changing direction, the question hasparticular urgency. Observers have long criticized SupremeCourt decisions, but, write Messrs. Tribe and Dorf, &quot;thelevel and tone of the public debate reached something of anew pitch by the end of the 1980s.&quot;   Overall, their discussion is both thoughtful andilluminating, even when their conclusions are debatable. Notsurprisingly, they are critical of Mr. Bork's reliance onoriginal intent. They worry about the malleability of words,for instance, and oppose giving effect to &quot;the secret,hidden, and unenacted intentions, specific wishes, orconcrete expectations of a group of people who may have beeninvolved in the process of enacting a constitutionalguarantee.&quot; They also criticize reliance on contemporaneous&quot;majority practices&quot; to determine a provision's meaning,which, they argue, would &quot;reduce the Constitution to a deadletter.&quot;   Yet none of their arguments really rebut the case forbasing decisions on, if not the narrow original intent of thefounders, the more general political compromise reached bythe framers, ratifiers and voters -- which includes thephilosophy that informed the public's opinions and actions.Indeed, judicial decisions will be considered legitimate onlyif they are perceived as enforcing &quot;the law of the land&quot;rather than a particular judge's philosophy.   Indeed, the authors criticize the opinion of Georgetown'sMark Tushnet that the Constitution should be read to requiresocialism: The fact that &quot;in various of its parts, theConstitution expressly affirms, sanctifies, and protects theinstitution of private property&quot; makes Mr. Tushnet's view&quot;untenable.&quot; Yet just six years ago, Mr. Tribe wrote thatgreater wealth redistribution might be achieved &quot;not only byaltering the terms of the Constitution, but also by bringingto the document different hopes and concerns.&quot;   The problem, of course, is whose &quot;hopes and concerns&quot;?Messrs. Tribe and Dorf criticize Lochner vs. New York and theCourt's pre-New Deal protection of economic liberty notbecause the court made &quot;significant value judgments,&quot; butbecause it &quot;chose the wrong values to enforce.&quot; Wrong,perhaps, to someone who believes in extensive incomeredistribution. But not wrong in the view of those who wrote,ratified and implemented the Constitution and the 14thAmendment. In fact, it is hard to think of values morecentral to the framers than economic freedom and limitedgovernment. Yet Messrs. Tribe and Dorf never satisfactorilyexplain why their values, however fashionable today, shouldprevail over those embodied in the nation's fundamental law.After all, the Constitution provides a procedure foramendment, allowing citizens to substitute new values for oldones.   Choosing the right values becomes all the more importantwhen the authors argue that unenumerated rights should beprotected through the clauses of the 14th Amendment barringstates from abridging &quot;the privileges or immunities ofcitizens,&quot; and the Ninth Amendment, which provides that &quot;theenumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall notbe construed to deny or disparage others retained by thepeople.&quot; The authors make a good case that these provisionsare neither irrelevant nor &quot;inkblots,&quot; but their bestevidence comes from the historical record, which indicatesboth measures were meant to restrain government interferencewith individual liberty. Indeed, if Messrs. Tribe and Dorfweren't so embarrassed about relying on the framers' originalintent, they might have cited James Madison's belief that thejudiciary was to serve as &quot;the bulwark of our liberties&quot; byenforcing people's constitutional rights.   &quot;On Reading the Constitution&quot; has value as a challenginganalysis of judicial interpretation and as a leading judicialactivist's entertaining attempt to reposition himself.Whether or not the &quot;kinder, gentler&quot; Mr. Tribe would survivea life term on the Supreme Court, his new persona has writtena better-than-expected book.   ---   Mr. Bandow is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute inWashington.</TEXT></DOC>
