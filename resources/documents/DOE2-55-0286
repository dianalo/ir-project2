These times areassociated with maximal proliferation of the alveolar type II epitheliumand their subsequent transformation to new type I cells. Immediatelyfollowing ozone exposure, bronchoalveolar lavage demonstrated neutrophilaccumulation that was no longer present 4 d later. The number of lavagedmacrophages was also found to be increased immediately following ozoneexposure, and remained elevated at 4 d postexposure. Whole-lung determinationsof key enzymes involved in energy generation (succinate oxidase) andmaintenance of lung NADPH and reduced glutathione were corrected forchanges in cell number, by use of lung DNA measurements. Immediatelyfollowing ozone exposure succinate oxidase (SOX), glucose-6-phosphate(G6PD), and 6-phosphogluconate (6PGD) dehydrogenase activities per milligramDNA were significantly enhanced by 76%, 48%, and 21%, respectively. Thesedata suggested that ozone-exposed lungs had cells with increased mitochondriaand NADPH-generating capability consistent with the increased metabolicneeds of a proliferating epithelium. At 4 d postexposure, only G6PD activityper milligram DNA remained higher by 22% than air-exposed controls. Althoughboth glutathione reductase (GSSG-R) and peroxidase (GSH-Px) activitiesper lung were elevated in lungs immediately following exposure and 4d later, when corrected for DNA only GSH-Px activity was significantlyincreased by 29% in lungs after the postexposure period. Lungs 4 d postexposuretherefore had cells relatively enriched in G6PD and GSH-Px that mightaccount for the increased ozone tolerance that has previously been associatedwith the formation of new type I epithelium.</TEXT></DOC>
