In order to prepare for the Second Session of the Regional AdministrativeRadio Conference on the expansion of the AM band from 1605 kHz to 1705kHz, the Commission adopts this <T3>Third Report. </T3>It is based on comments filed in response to a <T3>Third Notice of Inquiry </T3>(52 FR 27570, July 22, 1987), and otherinformation garnered through conference preparatory activities taking placeduring the period between the first and second sessions of the conference.2. One of the principal tasks of the Conference, which is scheduled totake place in Rio de Janeiro from May 23 to June 9, 1988, is to developa plan for the broadcast use of the band. At the First Session, it wasdecided to use an allotment planning method which makes designated frequenciesavailable for use anywhere within a specified area; whereas, under an assignmentplan, an assignment for each station is entered into the plan with a specificlocation, power and other pertinent characteristics. Allotment planningoffers flexibility while helping to ensure an efficient and equitable distributionof channels. It avoids the need to identify specific requirements and becauseit deals with allotments rather than specific assignments, an allotmentplan protects future rights without the need to identify them in advance.3. Because of the enlargement of the scope of the Second Session to includenon-broadcast as well as broadcast uses of the expanded band, there isa need to make several changes to the draft text of the final agreementadopted at the First Session. The issue of the text was discussed internationallyat the Lima meeting of CITEL PTC II, and a revised draft text was considered.Although no decision was made regarding this text, it met with generalsupport by the countries attending the CITEL meeting. The Commission believesthat this text with minor revisions is appropriate for adoption at theSecond Session of the Conference. Accordingly, it will be included in thedraft text for the Final Acts of the Conference that the FCC is recommendingas a United States proposal to the Second Session. 4. The Report discussed two technical issues not resolved by the FirstSession: The relationship between physical and electrical antenna heightsand the sharing of the band between broadcast and non-broadcast uses. Asto the former, considerable study has been given to this topic by the RadioAdvisory Committee and by the CCIR. The purpose of these studies was todetermine whether it would be posslble to develop a more accurate assessmentof an AM tower's electrical height than that currently in use in Region2. Based on these studies, we believe that the asserted correlation betweenphysical heights and electrical heights does not exist. After discussionof this issue at a CITEL PTC II meeting, there was agreement that thissubject was not a practical one for resolution by the Conference and thatelectrical height in the band 1605-1705 kHz should be based upon ``freespace'' calculations as is the case in the band 535-1605 kHz. 5. Another technical matter left for resolution at the Second Session ofthe Conference is the subject of ``sharing criteria.'' At the present time,in Region 2, the band 1605-1705 kHz is allocated to the fixed, mobile andaeronautical radionavigation services on a primary basis and to the radiolocationservice on a secondary basis. However, effective on a date to be decidedby the Expanded Band Conference, the band 1605-1625 kHz has been allocatedto the broadcasting service on an exclusive basis and the band 1625-1705kHz has been allocated to the broadcasting service on a primary basis,to the fixed and mobile services on a permitted basis and to the radiolocationservice on a secondary basis. Although most countries in the Region intendto use the band for broadcasting, some intend to continue (or even add)non-broadcast uses. As a consequence, it is necessary to develop sharingcriteria so that these non-broadcast uses do not cause a derogation inthe broadcasting Plan to be adopted. The CCIR has investigated this matterand its report to the Second Session of the Conference will be consideredwhen the Conference makes its decisions in this area. It is the FCC's tentativeconclusion that non-broadcast uses should be protected to a quality ofservice equivalent to ``marginal commercial quality''. This would ensurethe continued utility of such non-broadcast uses without imposing excessiveconstraints upon the broadcast service. 6. The treatment of Travelers Information Stations (TIS) was also of concernthroughout the various stages of this proceeding. Under current regulation,TIS stations operate on 1610 kHz (also on 530 kHz) which is outside the535-1605 kHz AM broadcast band, a situation which will change with expansionof the AM band. Not only is it not feasible to maintain TIS on 1610 kHzonce the AM band is expanded, but without international interference protectionfrom new broadcast stations, TIS operations would not be able to provideeffective service on 1610 kHz. Therefore, the Commission found the mostfeasible approach appears to involve the use of 1700 kHz for TIS. Any interferenceprotection for TIS will be derived from the allotment Plan adopted by theConference. Nonetheless, effective coordination with Canada and Mexicois essential and can help maximize the opportunity for these stations tooffer effective service. 7. Finally, we note that the bulk of the work at the Second Session ofthe Conference will be devoted to the development of a regional plan forbroadcast use of the expanded band. Current planning will be framed interms of the effect of one allotment on other allotments. For these purposes,we have adopted standardized separations between co-channel allotment areas.To make the best use of this approach, it is necessary to apply a ``pairing''concept, that is the idea that a frequency can be reused at a closer geographicdistance than otherwise would be possible in the absence of ``pairing''.8. At the Second Session it also will be necessary to take adjacent channelconsiderations (especially first adjacent) into account as frequenciesare alloted. Since a fully automated approach to taking adjacent channelsinto account (analogous to the co-channel situation) has not been found,it will not be possible to eliminate all first adjacent channel relationshipsbetween all geographically adjacent countries. However, we anticipate thatthe development of the Plan at the Second Session can avoid the potentialfor many first adjacent channel incompatibilities between countries byjudicious assignment of frequencies. Nevertheless, where incompatibilitiesremain, it will be necessary to handle them via bilateral and/or multilateralagreements between and/or among the affected countries. 9. In the event that agreements resolving some or all incompatibilitiesdo not exist, the Commission believes the most appropriate and effectivemanner of resolving these situations would be a provision to the effectthat when coordination has not been successfully affected with respectto the probability of harmful interference, on examination of notices offrequency assignments, the IFRB will take into account the frequency assignmentsfor transmission or reception already recorded in the Master InternationalFrequency Register. <ITAG tagnum="84">Authority Citation </ITAG>10.
