The inputs to the event generators are explained in detail.Their outputs are compared to available data from the Santi ppS collider,and the agreement is shown to be good. The importance of some featuresof the generators are discussed. It is shown that cluster productionand leading baryons are necessary to describe non-diffractive phenomena.</TEXT></DOC>
