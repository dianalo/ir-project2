More than 99 percent of the shares of NWA Inc. have beentendered to Wings Holdings Inc., Alfred Checchi, the formerMarriott Corp. treasurer who heads the group, said Monday.   Checchi said his financing was nearly in place and he waspressing for early termination of the waiting period beforefinalizing the deal as required under the Hart-Scott-RodinoAntitrust Improvement Act. The waiting period is scheduled toexpire Wednesday.   The Federal Trade Commission did not issue a ruling Monday onhis request.   The $121-a-share tender offer originally was set to expire atmidnight Friday, but Checchi extended it to 5 p.m. EDT Monday.David Duffy, a Wings spokesman in New York, said the offer may beextended again.   Northwest Airlines' pilots union and NWA resumed contract talksMonday with the help of Josh Javits, chairman of the NationalMediation Board, the union said. Talks were to continue today.   An agreement with the pilots is considered crucial to Checchi'splans to acquire the airline because a strike could impair hisability to generate enough cash to pay for the acquisition, whichwill total more than $4 billion.   Under federal regulations, if the pilots request thatnegotiations be declared at an impasse they could strike after a30-day cooling-off period.   Tim Thornton, an NWA vice president and its general counsel,said the primary issues remaining to be settled include wages, workrules and job security.   In another development Monday, the state of North Dakota sued toblock Checchi's bid to buy Northwest, saying the deal would violatewhat it called the airline's 1986 promise to avoid excessive fareincreases in the state.   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Bismarck, contendsthat if the sale is consummated, the airline won't be able to payoff its debts without cutting back service, laying off workers andraising fares.   Meanwhile, NWA reported record second-quarter earnings Monday of$70.8 million, or $2.38 a share. The profit was more than doublethat of the second quarter a year ago, when the airline earned$28.4 million, or 97 cents a share.   Revenues for the second quarter increased 19.3 percent, from$1.38 billion in the 1988 period to $1.65 billion, the company said.   Chairman Steven Rothmeier said passenger traffic increased 16percent over the second quarter of 1988, with capacity growing 15.6percent. The airline also experienced a 16.8 percent increase infreight revenues, from $113.5 million in last year's second quarterto $132.6 million.   Earnings for the first half were $83.3 million, or $2.82 ashare, on sales of $3.13 billion. That compared with a $15.1million net loss for the first six months of 1988, when revenueswere $2.62 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
