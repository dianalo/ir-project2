E Prime was formed 18 months ago by a group of retired space agency and defense company engineers. Bob Davis, the company's president and a former Boeing Co. aerospace engineer, said E Prime received word from the Air Force Friday that it had been cleared to fire a 14-foot rocket Oct. 6 from a pad at Cape Canaveral.    He said the flight will last about 15 minutes and reach an altitude of 20,000 feet; it will carry a payload containing various experiments from a group of universities and companies, including the University of Alabama-Huntsville and Morton Thiokol Inc.    Other companies have launched rockets, but all had some form of government backing, either in the form of subsidies or equipment, Mr. Davis said. He added that E Prime built its own rocket, received no subsidies and is renting the launching pad and other support services from the government for about $6,000.    Mr. Davis said the process of receiving insurance and government approval for the launch took over a year and laid down valuable signposts through the bureaucracy that will help it and other private space companies in future efforts to commercialize space ventures. </TEXT></DOC>
