Telephone number: (202) 732-4490.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>Supplementary Information: </T2>In the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on August 5, 1987, 52 FR 29120-29138, the Secretarypromulgated final rules governing those aspects of the Income ContingentLoan (ICL) Demonstration Project, other than the billing and collectionof ICL loans. On November 30, 1987, the Secretary published a notice ofproposed rulemaking (NPRM) pertaining to billing and collection in the<T4>Federal Register,</T4> 52 FR 45576. The Secretary now publishes finalrules for this aspect of the ICL program, as subpart E_Due Diligence. These ICL due diligence regulations require each institution participatingin the ICL Program (1) to inform ICL borrowers of their rights and responsibilities,(2) to attempt to collect from borrowers, and, under certain conditions,(3) to sue defaulted borrowers. The Secretary has utilized the PerkinsLoan Program due diligence requirements for the ICL Program with modificationsnecessary to address those issues that are unique to the ICL Program. Afew significant changes have been made to the NPRM as explained in thefollowing analysis. <ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments and Changes </ITAG>In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, seven parties submittedcomments on the proposed regulations. An analysis of the comments and ofthe changes in the regulations since publication of the NPRM follows. Major issues are grouped according to subject, with appropriate sectionsof the regulations referenced in parentheses. Other substantive issuesare discussed under the section of the regulations to which they pertain.Technical and other minor changes_and suggested changes the Secretary isnot legally authorized to make under the applicable statutory authority_arenot addressed. <ITAG tagnum="84">General </ITAG><T3>Comments:</T3> Several commenters supported the adoption of the PerkinsLoan due diligence requirements as a basis for those for the ICL Programon the ground that this approach minimizes confusion caused by conflictingrequirements for similar programs. Two commenters objected to the manner in which the NPRM was promulgated,<T3>i.e.</T3>, using the final Perkins Loan due diligence regulations asthe comment document and requesting comments on the appropriate adjustmentsneeded to these regulations to operate the ICL Program.<T3>Discussion: </T3>As with other aspects of the ICL Program, the duediligence procedures for the ICL Demonstration Project have been closelymodeled on the Perkins Loan Program requirements. The Secretary believesthat this consistency between the programs facilitates the administrationof both programs.The manner in which the NPRM was promulgated reflected the intention ofthe Secretary to utilize the same due diligence requirements set forthin the Perkins Loan Program regulations for the ICL Program, with minormodifications, as well as the need to establish final regulations for duediligence procedures for the ICL Program before institutions participatingin the ICL Demonstration Project during the 1987-88 academic year wouldbe presented with the need to use due diligence procedures to collect theseloans. Since all participating ICL institutions are required to have demonstrateda thorough and effective familiarity with the loan collection rules ineffect in the Perkins Loan Program in order to qualify for an ICL award,the Secretary believes that the method of promulgation for the NPRM wasthe most efficient way in which to achieve the goals of the DemonstrationProject in a timely manner.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comments: </T3>Two commenters recommended that the Secretary continueto evaluate the requirements of the ICL Program throughout the DemonstrationProject.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Higher Education Amendments of 1986 authorizedthe Secretary to conduct an Income Contingent Loan Demonstration Projectbeginning with the 1987-88 award year and charged the Secretary with providingan evaluation of the Demonstration Project to Congress. As indicated inthe regulations published August 5, 1987, the Secretary is evaluating theICL Demonstration Project on an on-going basis and, as a result of thisevaluation, may propose modifications to the statute and to the regulationsgoverning the ICL Program throughout the Demonstration Project.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comments: </T3>One commenter agreed that the Secretary should not routinelyaccept assignments of defaulted ICLs at this time.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The ICL Program provides a great deal of flexibilityfor institutions and borrowers who can therefore tailor repayment termsto fit their financial circumstances. As a result, the Secretary anticipatesthat the default rate for the ICL Program will be low, and that, at thepresent time, it is not necessary to implement procedures for institutionsto assign defaulted ICLs to the Department.<T3>Changes: </T3>All references to the assignment of defaulted ICLs havebeen deleted.Enforcement Policy and Procedures for Failure to Submit Required IncomeInformation<T3>Comments: </T3>A number of commenters wanted the Secretary to adoptan alternative method for calculating the annual repayment obligation ofa borrower who failed to submit the required income information in a timelymanner.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Failure to pay an established installment paymenton an ICL or Perkins loan presents the same problem to the institution,and there was little need to reconsider the NPRM to address the enforcementof the loan obligation in the case of a ``financial default.'' Only ICLobligations present the added responsibility to submit income informationto adjust a previously set installment payment level, and failure to meetthat obligation is a default on the loan as well.The Secretary noted in the NPRM that the need to secure from the borrowerannual income information was the principal difference between enforcementof Perkins loans and Income Contingent Loans, and he has reconsidered severalprovisions of the NPRM, which were based on the Perkins Loan enforcementregulations, with particular attention to this need. The Secretary recognizesin particular that the institution will be faced with the dilemma of decidingon appropriate enforcement action with regard to a borrower who fails tosubmit required income information but continues to make regular paymentsat a previously-established rate.The Secretary believes that additional study is needed before a decisionis made to implement any alternative repayment model of the type suggestedby one commenter for these ``information defaults.'' The Secretary alsorecognizes that the ``information defaulter'' demonstrates some degreeof compliance with the loan contract by submitting payments, and that tooabrupt a transition into enforced collection, including litigation, couldresult in a careless but not yet recalcitrant borrower deciding to withholdpayment of any kind until compelled to do so by a court judgment. Althoughthis may result in the establishment of a firm policy that the income informationmust be submitted, it could jeopardize the continued receipt of paymentson these loans, a matter of consequence to a loan fund designed to operateas a revolving fund. Not only would more forceful collection steps on an``information default,'' including acceleration of the loan, risk causingan interruption of the payments currently being made, but routine treatmentof an ``information default'' in the same manner as a ``financial default''would mean that the institution would engage a collection firm to handlethe debt. It is not reasonable to incur contingent fees on an account onwhich the borrower has submitted, and continues to submit, regular payments,because those collection efforts have not produced the payments againstwhich they would be charged. Whether or not those costs are fully chargedto the borrower, their imposition seems unnecessary and detrimental tothe program. Too lenient an enforcement policy, on the other hand, wouldundermine the integrity of the ICL program by permitting those borrowerswhose incomes have substantially increased, and therefore have the mostreason to withhold information, to disregard that duty with impunity.These considerations suggest the need for greater flexibility for the institutionin the selection of enforcement tools for ``information defaults'' thanis permitted for ``financial defaults''. Credit bureau reporting may beespecially effective for that group of borrowers who may be inclined towithhold information showing recent and substantial increases in theirincomes, because those individuals may be more likely than the averageborrower to seek those larger extensions of credit and employment in thosepositions for which a credit examination will be routinely performed. Defaultbased on failure to supply income information is a default nonetheless,and the borrower does not qualify for additional title IV aid while thatdefault persists; however, the sanction of ineligibility for further aidmay be less useful in dealing with this group of borrowers. An institutionthat adopts a policy of withholding academic transcripts for loan defaultersmight appropriately use that sanction for ``information defaults'' as well.The Secretary notes that a borrower who defaults remains in default untila satisfactory written repayment agreement has been reached with the institution.34 CFR 668.7(e)(2)(ii), 673.2(b), 674.2(b). The institution may insistthat the ``information defaulter,'' by that repayment agreement, repaythe loan on a schedule fixed by the institution without regard to futurechanges in income.<T3>Changes: </T3>The Secretary does not believe it prudent to adopt analternative repayment method at this time, and no change has been madeto adopt this recommendation. However, the Secretary has made other changesto the NPRM to address the problem of the ``information default'' describedby the commenter. First, andSection; 673.52(a) has been amended to requireexplanation during the exit interview of the duty to supply income information.Section 673.52(c) has been amended to require the institution to contactthe borrower by October 1 of each year of the repayment period to remindthe borrower to submit the required income information by the followingNovember 1.To deal with the need for flexibility in the use of collection methods,the Secretary has amended andSection;andSection; 673.53 and 673.55 to requirethe institution to report ``information defaults'' that are not (yet) ``financialdefaults'' to credit bureaus, but to permit the institution to defer moreforceful collection action_in particular, the use of collection firms andresort to litigation_until after it accelerates the loan, or until afterthe borrower misses a payment and becomes a ``financial default'' as well.In reporting an ``information default'' to a credit bureau, the institutionshould use the credit bureau status that indicates that the account is``not being paid in accordance with the agreement between the creditorand the borrower'' (e.g., TRW status code 70, CBI status code 079). Althoughcredit bureaus use various codes to do so, the Secretary believes thatthis adverse rating is widely used and understood by credit bureaus andtheir customers. The Secretary considers this relatively inexpensive sanctionan appropriate enforcement tool to deal with ``information defaults'' inlight of the negative consequences that may follow more forceful collectiontechniques. The institution may use its discretion in determining whento accelerate the loan; the institution may do so when it determines thatthe borrower has demonstrated persistent or repeated failure to reportincome information. The Secretary believes that this determination canbe reasonably made when the borrower has failed, despite demand, to submitrequired information for a full year; the institution may accelerate earlierthan that, depending on the facts presented in a particular case, includingfailure in the past to submit this information timely, or an interveningfailure to submit a payment of any kind.Sections 673.53 Billing Procedures and 673.55 Collection Procedures<T3>Comments: </T3>Two commenters suggested that the cost of maintainingfunds received at billing services and collection agencies in interest-bearingaccounts will not be offset by the interest earnings on the accounts andrequested modification to the regulations to allow banking costs not offsetby interest earnings to be charged to the fund.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary believes that the overall net incometo the fund as a result of maintaining ICL funds in interest-bearing accountsoffsets any loss to a particular school. Furthermore, billing servicesand collection agencies may each commingle in their accounts the ICL fundscollected as long as they can identify the interest earnings by institution.In addition, although banking costs not offset by interest earnings maynot be charged to the fund, an institution may use its administrative costallowance to cover these costs.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.Section 673.54 Address Searches<T3>Comments: </T3>One commenter supported the use of procedures underandSection; 673.54, ``Address Searches'', covering past-due payments fordelays in submission of income information when the delay in submissionis the result of a bad address.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary agrees with the commenter and notesthat the procedures outlined under andSection; 673.54 are to be used by theinstitution to attempt to locate a borrower whenever the institution hassent mail, other than unclaimed mail; to the borrower which is returnedundeliverable.<T3>Changes: </T3>None. Section 673.57 Costs Chargeable to the Fund<T3>Comments: </T3>Two commenters asked the Secretary to clarify the impositionof costs to the borrower in the collection process.<T3>Discussion: </T3>If the institution has incurred costs in followingthe prescribed due diligence procedures, these costs must be passed onto the borrower. Certain costs, such as those associated with address searchesand credit bureau reporting, may be paid directly from the fund and laterpassed on to the borrower. The payments received from the borrower arethen to be applied to these accrued collection costs and to contingencyfees charged by collection agencies.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>These regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order12291. They are not classified as major because they do not meet the criteriafor major regulations established in the order.<ITAG tagnum="84">Assessment of Educational Impact</ITAG>In the notice of proposed rulemaking, the Secretary requested commentson whether the proposed regulations would require transmission of informationthat is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authorityof the United States.Based on the response to the proposed rules and on its own review, theDepartment has determined that the regulations in this document do notrequire transmission of information that is being gathered by or is availablefrom any other agency or authority of the United States.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 34 CFR Part 673</ITAG>Education, Loan programs_education, Student aid.<ITAG tagnum="21">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number N/A) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: October 4, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lauro F.
