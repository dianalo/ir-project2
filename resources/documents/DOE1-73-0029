Transverse andcoronal imaging were performed by spin-echo sequence with electrocardiogramgating. MRI clearly demonstrated the normal mediastinal and hilar structures.More than 90% of pulmonary vessels and lobar bronchi were identified.Seventy six percent of mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes shown on resectedmaterials to be over than 1 cm in diameter were detected, as comparedto 82% for hilar nodes alone. Staging for T factor, tumor size were fairlyaccurate but P factor was correctly diagnosed of 64%. In atelectasis,the pulmonary artery was presented as a linear structure, and this findinghas not been reported yet. Our experience suggests that MRI is usefulfor the diagnosis of atelectasis, vascular involvement, and hilar lymphadenopathy.</TEXT></DOC>
