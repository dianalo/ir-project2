Transplant patients have previously been infected with the virusthat causes AIDS, but Thursday's report from the U.S. Centers forDisease Control marked the first time AIDS virus has beenassociated with a bone transplant, and the first case ever reportedin which any kind of transplant has resulted in AIDS itself.   ``This is consistent with how we have found the virus to betransmitted previously _ in blood, bodily fluids and body partsfrom another individual. ... It's an expected mode oftransmission,'' said Dr. John Ward, an AIDS specialist with theAtlanta-based CDC.   Ward noted that the surgery in question took place before theadvent of antibody testing for AIDS; the donor was an intravenousdrug user infected with AIDS.   ``It's important for the lay public to understand that this caseoccurred in 1984. ... The donor could not be screened,'' he said.   Since then, AIDS tests have become available, and the PublicHealth Service has recommended that all donors of tissue or organsbe tested for AIDS infection.   This first AIDS-transplant case occurred in a woman withprogressive spinal disease who, in November 1984, underwent aspinal fusion using bone from her hospital's bone bank. In February1988, she was diagnosed with AIDS. She was a health care worker,but there were no indications she had contracted an AIDS infectionon the job, the CDC reported.   The donor from whom the bone came, a 52-year-old man who hadundergone a partial hip bone removal, turned out to be anintravenous drug user, and thus at high risk for AIDS. He wasdiagnosed with AIDS less than two years after the woman's surgeryand died in 1987.   The Public Health Service, the CDC's parent agency, recommendedThursday that living donors of bone be tested for AIDS at the timethe bone is removed, and then again 90 days later to ensure thatany AIDS infection is detected.   More than 74,000 AIDS cases have been reported in the UnitedStates, with more than 42,000 deaths so far, according to the CDC.   Some 24 cases of AIDS virus transmission through transplantshave been reported worldwide, in cases such as kidney, liver andheart transplants, Ward said. None of those patients has beendiagnosed with AIDS itself, but ``undoubtedly, some will developAIDS in the future,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
