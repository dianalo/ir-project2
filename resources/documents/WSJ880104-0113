The 2% pay raise goes to 2.2 million military employees and 2.1 million civilian employees. About 7,500 federal employees --including members of Congress, Supreme Court Justices and others whose salaries are above the $72,500 level --won't get any pay increase under the president's New Year's Eve executive order.    Separately, the president signed a measure passed by Congress that grants a 4.2% cost-of-living increase for veterans with service-connected disabilities and their dependents, and for surviving spouses and children of veterans whose deaths were service-connected. </TEXT></DOC>
