Sources said negotiators were near agreement for orders and options totaling eight or nine aircraft -- each with a basic cost of about $80 million -- and could reach an accord as early as today.    However, directors of St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas have stipulated that the company's civil aircraft unit must have at least 20 firm orders from two carriers -- including one in the U.S. -- before development of the MD-11 can begin. Development is expected to cost $700 million.    In St. Louis yesterday, a McDonnell Douglas spokesman wouldn't confirm or deny the British Caledonian order. And he wouldn't say whether the company has signed at least one major domestic customer.    A commitment by British Caledonian, Britain's No. 2 scheduled airline, would represent the first step toward McDonnell Douglas's long-delayed launch of the MD-11, and could shake loose orders from other interested airlines. It also would put pressure on the European consortium Airbus Industrie, which is trying to win enough orders to launch a rival model, the A-340.    British Caledonian, based in Crawley, England, confirmed that negotiations were under way with McDonnell Douglas. British Caledonian operates nine DC-10s, a wide-body trijet that is the basis for the MD-11.    David Coltman, managing director of British Caledonian, was quoted this week in a trade publication as saying the company prefers the MD-11 because it already operates DC-10s, among other reasons. Airline Business magazine quoted Mr. Coltman as saying that within eight years, British Caledonian wants to build a fleet of 18 long-range aircraft divided between MD-11s and Boeing Co. 747s.    In late July, McDonnell Douglas said it had letters of intent from two foreign carriers for the MD-11. Since then, the company has said it expected to get enough orders by year-end to go ahead with the project.    If the project goes as planned, the MD-11, more fuel-efficient than the DC-10, would carry 270 to 320 passengers, have a range of 6,700 nautical miles and would come into service in spring 1990. The basic model would cost $80 million and could be outfitted with engines from either General Electric Co. of the U.S. or the Pratt andamp; Whitney division of United Technologies Corp.    The MD-11, like the proposed Airbus A340, is aimed at serving long-distance routes that don't attract enough traffic to justify using a 450-seat 747. Analysts say the market for such aircraft will attract only 200 to 300 orders, meaning that there isn't room for both McDonnell Douglas and Airbus to make money.    Airbus is owned by Aerospatiale of France, Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.)H of West Germany, British Aerospace PLC and Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain. </TEXT></DOC>
