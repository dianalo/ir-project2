Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said there was a preliminarymeeting in Miami Monday, with a negotiating session planned Tuesdayunder the auspices of Sam Cognata of the National Mediation Board.   Pilots union spokesman Skip Orr called the session part ofcontract negotiations that have gone on sporadically since thepilots' contract became open to amendment more than a year ago. Thepilots' walkout was officially a sympathy strike for the EasternMachinists union, which went on strike after 1{ years of federallymediated talks stalemated.   Eastern and the pilots have a major new difference to negotiate:how the 2,200 pilots who just ended their strike will get theirjobs back, or whether they will get them back.   A letter from Skip Copeland, the head of Eastern's formerstriking pilots, to Eastern President Phil Bakes last week saidthat while a return to work was ``unconditional,'' ``it is ourposition that all strikers should be reinstated promptly.''   The letter said former striking pilots should receive seniorityand assignments in accordance with their contract.   In a separate development Monday, Atlanta's aviationcommissioner ordered striking Eastern Machinists to vacate their``tent city'' headquarters at Hartsfield Atlanta InternationalAirport because of a rock-throwing incident in which a workingEastern employee was injured.   Miami-based Eastern, which began rebuilding without its unions,said it has enough pilots _ 1,850 _ to operate its currentschedule. Of those, about 1,000 were hired as replacements duringthe strike, and Eastern contends their jobs are protected againstreturning strikers.   The two sides had been far apart on salary issues and work rulechanges, although no current details were available Monday.   Matell said the concessions Eastern wants from the pilots wereconsidered essential for the airline's effort to emerge fromChapter 11 bankruptcy protection.   Orr said the negotiations on returning union pilots to work willdemonstrate the company's attitudes toward its workers.   ``I think it would probably prevent possible litigation. Itwould indicate to everyone concerned that they really do want torebuild Eastern with the most experienced people available,'' Orrsaid.   ``And it would indicate by actions rather than just words thatthey do want to work with labor groups. We've never seen anyindications of that,'' he said.   Eastern on Friday amended an August request that U.S. DistrictCourt in Miami clarify the rights of employees who are currentlyworking and determine the rights of those who wish to return towork.   Matell said no hearing date had been set.   He said there are also tentative plans for negotiations thisweek between the company and the Transport Workers Union, whichrepresents flight attendants at Eastern.   The flight attendants followed the pilots last week in endingtheir sympathy strike, leaving only the Machinists union on thepicket lines.   Under the Railway Labor Act, covering the airline industry andother transportation labor, contracts remain in force until federalmediation has been tried and fails, after which the union maystrike and the company may impose its conditions.   Eastern last June sought in bankruptcy court to have the pilots'contract invalidated, but then withdrew that request.   After direct talks broke down, the pilots in June requestedfederal mediation. There also were negotiations with thecourt-appointed bankruptcy examiner, attorney David I. Shapiro.   Eastern filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization five daysafter the strike began March 4.</TEXT></DOC>
