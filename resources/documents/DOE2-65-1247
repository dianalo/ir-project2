The turbines would locatein coast areas. The price level of wind energy on today's level of experienceis 33-47 p/kWh. These figures include considerable development potential.Amount of 850 kW turbines would be about 4600-6400 pieces and the totalpower rating 3900-5400 MW. Globally maximum wind energy potential couldbe 150-300 TWh (= 1-2% of electricity production) in the year 2000. Atthe end of paper proposals for possible future development programmesare stated.</TEXT></DOC>
