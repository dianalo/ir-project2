Ford $1 million annually tomanage the newly created institution, First Gibraltar Bank. Thatdeal left lawmakers fuming. Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said,``The public will not stand for that kind of salary because,indirectly, it's taxpayer money.''   Revelations such as these have prompted six congressionalcommittees to launch investigations. The GAO is sifting through thedeals and one court suit has already been filed by disappointedbidders alleging the government acted improperly.   But bank board officials insist they have put together the bestdeals possible, maintaining that the favorable terms were necessaryto attract new capital and new investors into the troubled industry.   ``I would rather be criticized for having acted than not havingacted,'' Wall says.   Critics contend that the bank board deals are a recipe fordisaster. The new owners don't have a lot of capital in the dealsor, often, much experience in running Sandamp;Ls. In some cases, thefailed Sandamp;Ls were turned over to home builders or real estatedevelopers with an inherent conflict of interest in running afinancial institution.   Some critics say Congress should not approve the money to mop upthe Sandamp;L mess without changing the bank board's rules.   The GAO said the board's current approach, with its heavy use ofgovernment subsidies, could actually worsen the problem by making itmore difficult for marginal Sandamp;Ls to survive without the subsidies.   Lowell L. Bryan, a financial analyst for McKinsey andamp; Co., Inc.,warns that the board's flood of deals has created a ``new interestgroup of rich, powerful individuals who will fight to protect thesweetheart deals they have struck,'' further complicatingcongressional efforts to resolve the crisis.   As if those weren't enough problems, some in the industry worrythat the bank board deals will work only if the record peacetimeeconomic expansion continues.   ``These deals were built on certain assumptions on interest ratesand economic conditions and if those turn south, you could have asecond round of failures,'' said Mark Riedy, president of theNational Council of Savings Institutions, an industry lobbying group.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Monday, Feb. 6</NOTE></DOC>
