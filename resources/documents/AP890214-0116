The government daily Izvestia, publishing the kind of figuresthat have been secret since 1933, said the overall rate ofregistered crimes rose 3.8 percent last year and that the rate ofall crimes soared 17.8 percent.   ``Probably the figures published in the newspaper would shockmany,'' Izvestia said. ``But it's better to know the true state ofaffairs so that our safety _ and the police's concerns and problems_ will become clear.''   Some of the figures were released last month, but Tuesday'sreport was the most detailed yet.   The report, quoting the Interior Ministry, said 1,867,223 crimeswere registered last year, 68,700 more than in 1987. The country'spopulation is about 285 million.   On the last page of Izvestia was a table that listed among themost shocking statistics the number of premeditated murders. Theysoared 14.1 percent, from 14,651 in 1987 to 16,710 last year.   The higest increase among different categories of crimes wasregistered in break-ins and holdups, which rose 44.4 percent, from46,485 in 1987 to 67,114 last year. In 1988, 17,658 rapes werereported, a rise of 5.3 percent over the 1987 level of 16,765.   Some progress was reported in tackling economic crime. Izvestiasaid there were 96,986 cases of misappropriation of government andpublic property through embezzlement, theft and abuse of office in1987. The number fell 9.8 percent in 1988, to 87,450.   Economic crime is so widespread in the Soviet Union that manySoviets believe a ``second economy'' that is based on a black marketis thriving.   Interior Ministry official M. Yegorov told the Tass news agencythat speculators have been taking advantage of the shortages thatplague Soviet society. Twenty years ago, he said, only 17,000 casesof speculation were reported. Izvestia said there were 45,235 ofspeculation last year.   Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin told the Communist Partynewspaper Pravda last month that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev'sreforms have let loose not only more democracy but also thieves andattackers.   Under Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness, officials andthe state-run media have detailed drug abuse, prostitution, murdersand other crimes. The Kremlin's long-running attempt to blame suchproblems on the West and to claim that they had not crossed Sovietborders has been largely abandoned. The media often has painted apicture of the United States as a country where it was unsafe towalk on the streets at night.</TEXT></DOC>
