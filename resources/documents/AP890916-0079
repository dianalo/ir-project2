Quayle also will visit Malaysia and Japan on the trip, which willincorporate trade and human rights themes.   He begins the 11-day journey with a brief stop at Alaska'sElmendorf Air Force Base. There, accompanied by TransportationSecretary Sam Skinner, Quayle plans to focus attention on the statusof the cleanup of the Exxon Valdez oil spill.   They will meet with fishermen and state and local representativesregarding cleanup progress since the March spill by the Exxon tankerthat despoiled thousands of miles of pristine shoreline. Exxon lastweek was packing up most of its crews for the winter following a25-week cleanup effort.   Federal officials have insisted the oil company will return nextspring to continue the cleanup and Quayle will underscore thatmessage.   After hearing about the status from the local representatives, hemight call for Exxon to conduct some winter cleanup efforts, whichAlaska state officials are planning to do themselves, said oneadministration official who spoke on condition of anonymity.   Quayle's journey to South Korea and Japan comes as uneasinessover the U.S. trade deficits with each nation continue to fester. Intalks with leaders in those countries, the vice president will urgethem to open their markets to reverse the trade imbalancesituations, said Quayle's press secretary, David Beckwith.   The vice president, in previewing his trip last week, said hewould focus on ``the importance of having non-protectionistpolicies, the importance of having open markets and access, theimportance of having a two-way street when it comes to trade.''   ``There are concerns of the American people about access toJapanese markets, about whether the United States is getting a fairshake in the trade relationship,'' Quayle said in an interview withforeign journalists.   Additionally, in Korea, where persistent demonstrations areevidence of a feisty anti-U.S. movement, Quayle is expected tostress a human rights message.   Some U.S. officials have expressed concerns about the recentindictment of opposition leader Kim Dae-Jung and two lawmakers oncharges of failing to report an associate's secret trip to communistNorth Korea.   One source said administration concerns center on possiblepolitical motivations for the indictments. Kim Dae-Jung, a formerpresidential candidate who heads the largest opposition party, hasaccused Korea's government of trying to undermine his party and hedenies any involvement with the North Korea trip.   Asked last week whether he would raise human rights with theKorean government, said he would. ``Democracy and freedom and humanrights go together,'' he said. ``I know in my discussions I will bespeaking from an ideological and philosophical point of view inthose terms.''   Quayle will be greeted in South Korea by the newly arrivedambassador Donald Gregg, President Bush's former national securityadviser who won Senate confirmation recently after rough hearingsinto his knowledge of the Iran-Contra affair.   South Korea also figures importantly into U.S. military strategy,with 43,000 U.S. personnel stationed there.   Bush is running into congressional roadblocks as he tries tostrengthen that presence. Several Congress members have called forreductions in the U.S. troop strength, but Quayle said theadministration is ``adamantly opposed'' to any reduction.   The Senate on Friday virtually wiped out the $86.3 million Bushrequested for new construction at U.S. bases there. The House hadearlier earmarked $74.2 million for that purpose, and a compromiseremains to be worked out.   The Senate also cut all $40.8 million Bush requested for work onits Philippines bases, pending upcoming negotiations on a new treatyto replace the one under which the United States leases Clark AirBase and Subic Bay Naval Base.   Controversy over the bases is certain to be an issue duringQuayle's visit, at a time when the United States and the Philippinesare preparing to start negotiations on renewing the six militarybase leases that expire in 1991.   Many Filipino lawmakers are demanding far higher U.S. aid inreturn, or a phased withdrawal of American forces.   A move is afoot in the Philippine Senate to close the bases.President Corazon Aquino, scheduled to visit the United States inNovember, has refused to say whether she favors keeping the bases,which employ some 70,000 Filipinos.   Quayle's visit to Malaysia is said by some officials to be aneffort to nudge Manila by courting another potential suitor for thebase. However, Malaysian leaders have indicated they would not wantthe U.S. bases, and have voiced opposition to the position ofSingapore which said it would welcome the bases should Manila ejectthem.   Quayle is also expected to discuss with Asian allies the volatilepolitical situation in Cambodia, where the shape of the futuregovernment is uncertain as Vietnam withdraws its occupying troops.Efforts, closely watched by the United States, so far have failed toorganize a power sharing by two non-communist resistance groups andthe Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge.   In Japan, Quayle will visit Tokyo's space center in Tsukuba fordiscussions on expanding U.S.-Japan space cooperation. Japan is apartner in NASA's project to develop a space station, and Quayle,who heads the president's national Space Council, said he wants totalk about how the relationship ``can move forward and be enhanced.''   He also will be in Japan for the conference of the InternationalDemocratic Union, an international organization of conservativeparty leaders, including Great Britain's Margaret Thatcher.</TEXT></DOC>
