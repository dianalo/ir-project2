At leastthat's the view of many Icelanders, who dislike foreignphrases cluttering up their ancient tongue. To slow thespread of &quot;jogurt&quot; and &quot;hamborgarar,&quot; Icelanders now arepurging their vocabulary by finding old words for new things.   Icelandic has changed so little in the past 800 years that&quot;some parts of the sagas could have been written thismorning,&quot; says Baldar Jonsson, head of the Icelandic LanguageInstitute. But the Vikings didn't have computers. ModernIcelanders do. They call them &quot;tolva,&quot; a merger of twomedieval words, meaning &quot;numbers prophetess.&quot; The word fortelephone, &quot;simi,&quot; translates as &quot;long thread.&quot; A militarytank is &quot;skrithdreki,&quot; or &quot;crawling dragon.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Iceland now has committees grappling with foreign phrasesin 30 fields, from aviation to physics. Amateur wordsmithsoften send in ideas of their own. It is a task for whichIcelanders are well-suited. Per capita, Iceland has morebookstores and Trivial Pursuit games than any nation in theworld. Long, dark winters also afford ample time forbrainstorming.   Iceland isn't alone in fighting to keep its language pure.France has long done battle with &quot;Franglais,&quot; but linguisticpatriotism is hard to enforce in such a big and cosmopolitanland.   In remote, sea-locked Iceland, the war against Icelishappears more successful. New words are published in journalsand quickly filter out through classrooms, dictionaries andthe media. In a society of only 250,000 people, it doesn'ttake long for word to travel, and to catch on.   Mr. Jonsson helped compose two words for AIDS. One is&quot;alnaemi,&quot; which roughly translates as &quot;sensitive toeverything.&quot; The other is &quot;eythni,&quot; derived from an old verbmeaning &quot;to squander.&quot;   Kirstin Flygenring, an economist, is combing WilliamBranson's &quot;Macroeconomic Theory,&quot; listing terms such as&quot;liquidity trap&quot; for which Icelandic substitutes are needed.Sometimes, a literal translation will do. The &quot;gross&quot; ingross national product, for instance, is easily derived froman Icelandic word meaning &quot;polluted&quot; or &quot;unfiltered.&quot; Butcolloquialisms don't translate so easily. Iceland doesn'thave junk bonds or greenmail (or even a stock exchange), and&quot;putting some of these words into Icelandic can make themconfusing and a little silly,&quot; Ms. Flygenring says.   In a related campaign, Icelanders also are weeding outforeign names. Traditionally, Icelanders have been known byfirst names only, followed by a patronymic; hence, Jon, theson of Thor, is Jon Thorsson, and his sister's last name isThorssdottir. Iceland's slim phone book is alphabetized byfirst names, and Icelanders rarely use Mr. or Mrs., exceptwhen traveling abroad.   But over the past century, many Icelanders have takenmiddle names and also adopted non-Icelandic surnames. To stemthis tide, Iceland's parliament, or Althing, is expected totoughen an existing ban on non-Icelandic surnames and also toestablish a formal list of acceptable forenames.   &quot;Names are part of our language and if we lose them welose our history,&quot; says Guthrun Kvaran, who is drafting thelaw. While aimed at preserving tradition, the law alsoacknowledges modern trends. Children born out of wedlock willbe able to take their mother's name.   Immigrants who become Icelandic citizens also must takenew names and pass them on to their children. Hence, aVietnamese refugee named Tran Dat Phat now is Petur Tran DatPhat, and his children take the name Petursson orPetursdottir.   One notable exception to this rule is Vladimir Ashkenazy,the Soviet pianist and conductor who was allowed to keep hisname after becoming an Icelander. (His wife is Icelandic, buthe now spends more of his time in Switzerland.)   The Ashkenazy case inspired a Spanish immigrant inReykjavik, unhappy at having to adopt an Icelandic name, tolodge a bizarre protest. As the Russian pianist's name wasnow an approved Icelandic moniker, the Spaniard announcedthat he wanted to take Vladimir Ashkenazy as his name, too.Officials were amused but unmoved.</TEXT></DOC>
