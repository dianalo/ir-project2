But a benevolentdictatorship with control over the hardware platform and the operating systemis in a better position than IBM or Microsoft to make it happen.andM;The basis for this new paradigm for Macintosh software development is Version7 of the Mac operating system, due out later this year.andP;  Version 7 willsupport several levels of inter-application communication, from the existingcopy and paste buffer to live copy and paste, network support, andstore-and-forward communication.andP;  Apple argues that the rich set ofinterapplication communication tools in System 7 will lead to a new kind ofsoftware; to smaller, targeted tools that do one thing well, rather thanmassive integrated applications that try to do everything.andM;Apple believes that this will happen, is convinced that it had better happen,and is doing a lot to make it happen.andM;Claris has been talking up the new approach, saying in guest editorials incomputer magazines that Macintosh software developers need to learn a new wayof operating - a new cooperative spirit; the word Glasnost may not appearexplicitly, but it's there between the lines.andP;  All this sounds better, onemight argue, coming from a third-party developer rather than just from Apple.andO;That is, if Apple software spinoff Claris can be called a third-partydeveloper.andP;  The term &quot;stalking horse&quot; trots to mind.andM;Is Apple/Claris right? Is cooperative programming going to work? And if so,what will this cooperative programming be like?andM;Getting the MessageandM;Here's what Apple's interapplication support under System 7 will include:andM;* The current copy and paste facility, restricted to data only, supportingvarious formats.andP;  The Scrap Manager will continue to provide this basic formof interapplication communication.andM;* Live copy and paste, in which changes made to the original (after copyingand pasting) are reflected in all the copies.andP;  This is a new facility,provided by the Edition Manager in System 7.andM;* Message passing.andP;  Changes to the Event Manager will allow messages to bepassed between applications rather than just within.andM;* AppleEvents.andP;  This is an Apple-defined set of standard messages that allapplications will be expected to handle and that all are permitted to send.andO;Message passing between applications will not be limited to AppleEvents, butAppleEvents will provide, in effect, a language for interapplicationcommunication.andP;  It will also serve as the enabling technology for a futureuser scripting language.andP;  The user scripting language will allow users tocontrol applications and the system itself with unprecedented (for theMacintosh) flexibility and power, and with a single, universal userinterface.andM;* Lower-level tools for interapplication communication, including separatetoolboxes for immediate and store-and-forward communication.andO;Store-and-forward will allow the user or an application to leave a messagefor another application to handle even if the other application is currentlyin use or not running or temporarily in an inaccessible comer of a network.andM;The low-level interapplication communication facilities may be most usefulbetween applications from a single vendor, but it seems likely that onlyAppleEvents, with its high level of control from Apple, will have the powerto make cooperative programming between vendors work.andM;AppleEvents may also present a new kind of pressure to adapt.andP;  It could bethe best tool Apple has for getting third-party developers to addinterapplication communication features to their software fast.andP;  Here's a(perhaps) fanciful account of how that might work: pens is up to the systemor to the messaging application, but not to you.andP;  In effect, part of the(extended) interface to your application has been taken out of your bands.andO;An unanswered message to your spreadsheet application triggered from within acompetitor's wordprocessing application could conceivably result in a messagesuch as &quot;Sorry.andP;  That spreadsheet program is too dumb to handle this simplerequest.andP;  Maybe you should consider buying our spreadsheet program, whichalways works smoothly with our word processor and if you send in your copy ofthat worthless spreadsheet-program, we'll give you a 20 percent discount.andP;  &quot;andM;Maybe it won't work that way, but it is true that the mere existence ofinterapplication communication will create a new window into every existingapplication.andP;  And it is true that the control over this window, thisextension to the application's interface, will be in the hands of thedeveloper of the application only if the application supports AppleEvents.andM;In any case, if your application is going to fail to handle these messages,it's much nicer if it can fail gracefully to handle them.andP;  This should befairly easy.andP;  The set of AppleEvents messages will be well defined, andhandling an AppleEvents message doesn't mean that you really have to dosomething with it.andP;  You can simple acknowledge it and do nothing, or sendback some message of your own.andP;  That's code that could be written overnight.andM;Here comes the real pressure.andP;  What was formerly a large task, upgrading yourapplication to take full advantage of a major new release of the operatingsystem, has now become a collection of small features to add.andP;  The insidiousaspect of this is that, once you've got a (dummy) handler for the message inyour code, it nags you to make it real, as other people in your company aregoing to nag you to do the same.andM;Then there's user scripting.andP;  Apple has pushed back its attack on userscripting to Version 8.0, but others are not waiting for 8.0: Manufacturersof applications that already have user scripting will explore ways toincorporate AppleEvents into their scripting languages.andP;  Shortly, users aregoing to start sending messages to your application.andM;So yes, it looks like Apple's interapplication communication is going tocatch on quickly, and it looks like cooperative programming will become afact of life.andP;  And that is going to raise some new problems, not all of whichare technical.andM;Back to the FutureandM;Here are some follow-up observations on some of the more futuristic subjectsI've discussed here recently: chaos theory, neural networks, and fractals.andM;Recently, I wrote here about chaos theory in human physiology, and suggestedthat the combination of neural nets and chaos theory could produce a powerfultool for exploring the behavior of certain types of complex systems.andP;  At theEURASIP Workshop on Neural Networks in Portugal this year, Steve Renals ofEdinburgh University presented some results of work on chaos theory andneural networks.andP;  One of his conclusions was that chaos could fulfill animportant role in associative memory systems by providing a  don't know&quot;state.andP;  The conference papers are collected in &quot;Neural Networks: EURASIPWorkshop 1990 Proceedings,&quot; Springer-Verlag, 1990.andM;The April issue of Scientific American contained a piece on the uSE Of neuralnetworks in determining the structure of complex protein molecules.andP;  It'sapparently no longer particularly difficult to map out the sequence of aminoacids that make up a protein molecule, but the three-dimensional twists andturns of the chain-like molecule are very hard to identify.andP;  The twistingstructure, which determines the properties of the protein, depends on theelectrical forces between individual amino acids in the chain.andP;  A brute-forceapproach to determining the structure would simply examine all forces betweenall pairs of amino acids; and with very short chains, the brute-forceapproach works.andM;For most interesting proteins, though, the brute-force approach is useless.andO;Terrence Sejnowski and Ning Qian of Johns Hopkins University have tackled theproblem with a neural-network approach first used by Sejnows and CharlesRosenberg in NETtalk, a neural net that learns to pronounce English words.andO;NETtalk uses context to determine the pronunciation of individual phonemes(units of sound very roughly comparable to letters in written English).andO;NETtalk has had some impressive success, and Sejnowski and Qian thought thatthe electrical interactions among segments of a protein could be modeled verymuch like context effects on phonemic units.andP;  The results, though limited,look promising, and Sejnowski thinks that neural nets have a real future inmolecular biology.andM;The April issue of Scientific American also asks the question, Who inventedthe Mandelbrot set? There is a surly controversy brewing over credit in thefield of fractals and particularly for this set, which has been called &quot;themost complex object in mathematics.&quot; You compute the Mandelbrot set from theformula [z.sup.2] + c, where z and c are complex numbers, by assigning aconstant value to c, setting z initially to 0, and feeding the output of theformula back into z iteratively.andP;  Pictures of the Rorschach-like Mandelbrotset have appeared here and elsewhere, and are distinctive, if only arguablyattractive.andP;  Whatever its aesthetic merits, the Mandelbrot set's discovery isan important event in the history of mathematics, as the set has manyapplications, especially in the testing of complex dynamical systems.andP;  TheStudy Of Such systems is the aforementioned chaos theory.andM;One mathematician quoted in the Scientific American piece lays all the blamefor the controversy at IBM mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot's feet.andO;Apparently all of the following people deserve some credit in the discoveryand exploration of the Mandelbrot set: Pierre Fatou, who defined the setmathematically; Gaston Julia, Mandelbrot's teacher, who defined the Juliaset, of which the Mandelbrot set is a generalization; John H. Hubbard andAdrien Douady, who have done much work on the set, Hubbard having producedMandelbrot pictures three years before Mandelbrot; Robert Brooks and J. PeterMatelski, who published both an explicit mathematical formulation and acomputer printout showing the familiar image of the set before Mandelbrot;and F. Riesz, who did related work about 40 years ago.andP;  No one challenges theimportance of Mandelbrot's own contribution, but many are put off byMandelbrot's aggressive self-promotion as the sole discoverer of the set.andO;Former DDJ editor Randy Sutherland and I joined the put-off when we dealtwith Mandelbrot while trying to get permission to reproduce a picture of theMandelbrot set in DDJ a few years ago.andP;  As Douady said, &quot;He loves to quotehimself and he is very reluctant to quote others who aren't dead.&quot;andM;John Horgan, who wrote the Scientific American piece, suggests that thecontroversy may in part be evidence of paradigm clash.andP;  Mandelbrot is anapplied mathematician and many of his critics are pure mathematicians, withdifferent ideas about allocating credit for work.andP;  Horgan's suggestion placesthis coolness among Mandelbrot mathematicians in the context of a largericeberg, which also includes the near-universal confusion in the Public mindbetween the conduct and goals of pure and applied science, and between theditto of science and engineering; it touches the glacial spread of universityinvolvement in industry, the consequences of which nobody seems to beexamining very closely.andP;  What it doesn't do is to warm the aforementionedcoolness among Mandelbrot mathematicians.andM;Maybe Michael Spindler could explain to them about prima donnas andcooperation among competitors.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
