Dr. Gale and his collaborators were careful not to infer that victims of a U.S. radiation accident would fare as poorly as the Russians did. Five of the 13 patients eventually succumbed to burns suffered in a major fire that resulted from the accident in the Soviet-designed graphite reactor in 1986. U.S.-designed reactors make such a fire highly unlikely.    At the same time, the article noted that, contrary to conventional thinking, a bone-marrow transplant apparently isn't risk-free because it can cause both a rejection reaction and interstitial pneumonia. At least two of the patients who died suffered from severe rejections, while three who died contracted the pneumonia.    Transplantation successfully stimulated blood-cell production in nine of the 13 patients, all of whom were men, ranging in age from 23 to 46. Ten of the donors were siblings, while three were parents.    Of the 11 who died, none lived longer than 2 1/2 months after his bone-marrow transplant. Both of the patients still alive more than three years after the accident are well, the article reported, although one still has burn-related problems and radiation-induced cataracts. The two survivors were 25 and 35 at the time of the accident and didn't have the serious burns that afflicted the others.    In an accompanying editorial, Christine K. Cassell and Jennifer Leaning, of the University of Chicago and Harvard University, respectively, said Dr. Gale's work &quot;adds greatly to our knowledge of the management of acute radiation injury.&quot; The editorialists used Dr. Gale's article to criticize the U.S. Energy Department for having, until recently, allegedly covered up health and safety problems at U.S. nuclear weapons-manufacturing facilities. </TEXT></DOC>
