Manuel Antonio Noriega or firms inwhich he has an interest.   The penalty for violators is a jail term or fines of $500,000,officials said Friday.   The sanction is the product of an effort by the administrationto find ways of pressuring Noriega without further damaging thePanamanian economy. In an additional bid to deprive Panama ofsorely needed income, the administration also is consideringbarring Panamanian-flag vessels from U.S. ports, said theadministration officials.   Panama has been in a steep economic decline over the past yearand a half, partly as a result of limited sanctions imposed by theUnited States.   Many of the more than 30 firms targeted by the new sanctions areused as intermediaries for illegal trade between the United Statesand Cuba.   The U.S. move will not only tighten the embargo against Cuba butwill also affect firms in which Noriega has an interest, said theofficials, who asked not to be identified.   The sanction was first reported by The Los Angeles Times in itsFriday editions. State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler hadno comment on the report.   Cuba has found the Panamanian firms identified with Noriega tobe useful, using them to import high technology U.S.-made itemswhich would otherwise be beyond Cuba's reach because of the tradeembargo.   The firms also have served as conduits for illegal Cuban exportsto the United States, officials said, speaking on condition theynot be identified.   The Bush administration has been searching for additional waysto weaken Noriega since long before the abortive coup attemptagainst him almost three weeks ago.   The administration has not ruled out the use of force butvisiting Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez said Friday anysuch step would be unwise.   ``Interventionism is never desirable,'' Gonzalez said shortlybefore ending his two-day visit here.   He praised President Bush for not committing U.S. forces toall-out support for the rebel officers who revolted against Noriega.   Gonzalez has called for new elections in Panama and for thenewly elected leadership to have the authority to name a newDefense Force commander to replace Noriega.</TEXT></DOC>
