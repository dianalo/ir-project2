(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A 73-year-old cancer patient says hedecided to go to prison as a matter of principle rather than accepta solution to a decade-old dispute over a sewer hookup that wouldhave cost him nothing.   ``I'm doing this to show my rights to America,'' Wilbert Siegel,a retired metal worker with rectal cancer, said Wednesday as he wastaken from his modest James Island home near here to begin asix-month sentence for contempt of court.   A large American flag decorated Siegel's porch and yellow ribbonsadorned pine trees in his yard as he tearfully kissed his wife,Hattie, goodbye.   He was then taken to Lieber Correctional Institution inRidgeville.   ``I'm not scared because I'm going to jail.'' But, he said, ``sixmonths is a long time for anybody to go to jail, especially on acharge like this.''   Siegel was imprisoned for defying a 1986 court order requiringhim to tie his septic tank to a sewer line.   The problem began in 1979 when the Siegels paid a fee to tap intothe line. When the line was installed, it ended at a corner of theirlot, too far away, according to Siegel, who said he would have hadto spend $2,000 and take down four large trees to make theconnection.   Siegel said the line should be extended in front of the house,where a straight 30-foot connection could be made.   Ray Patterson, chairman of the James Island Public ServiceDistrict, said the utility had been willing to extend the line, butthe Siegels would have been billed an additional $200, which theydeclined to pay.   Patterson said it would cost the public utility about $1,200today to extend the line.   He said it would cost only $700 to connect to the corner tap, andthat district commissioners offered to come out on their own timeand dig the ditch.   The utility ``bent over backwards'' to resolve the problem, hesaid.   A Charleston Heights plumber on Tuesday offered to make theconnection for free, but the Siegels declined, saying they didn'twant charity.   ``What's the difference where the tap is if somebody puts it infree and you don't have to pay for it?,'' Patterson said.   He added that the Siegels were ``just looking for publicity andto get sympathy.''   Circuit Judge William Howell on Nov. 1 found Siegel in contemptof the 1986 ruling that he make the connection, and gave him 60 daysto hook up or go to prison.   Siegel, who'll appear in court again after serving his sentence,predicted he'll probably be returned to prison.   ``I have a life sentence for not hooking up to an unequal sewerline,'' he said.   He said more than 100 area homes haven't tapped into the systembut that he was the one who was singled out and eventually arrested.   Patterson said the other homes were being handled one by one.   The public service district has spent about $40,000 in legal feeson the matter, including defending a $500,000 federal lawsuit by theSiegels challenging the utility's right to require the connection,officials said.   That lawsuit was dismissed last year.   It probably will cost more than $6,000 to care for Siegel duringhis six-month prison stay, according to state Department ofCorrections spokesman Francis X. Archibald.</TEXT></DOC>
