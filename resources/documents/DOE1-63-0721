It is now a tradingfund and offers research facilities to industry on a contract basis.This will be further promoted. The Authority's main business remainsthe development of systems producing economic electricity. An exampleof this is the work on the proposed commercial fast reactor. However,the expertise and specialised facilities developed for this have applicationsin other areas relevant to British and overseas industry. An exampleof this is the technology developed at the UKAEA's Harwell laboratoriesfor assuring the firm attachment of steel platforms to the sea bed. Radioactivetracers are added to underwater cement grouting enabling the progressof grout injection to be monitored. Oil recovery techniques, chemicalscaling problems, pipeline flow, safety and reliability, the developmentof a pocket gamma radiation dosimeter, structural integrity testing andproblem solving, development of electric propulsion systems for spacesatellites, advanced robotics and computing services are all areas ofUKAEA research and development interest and capability.
