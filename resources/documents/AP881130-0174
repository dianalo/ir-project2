Thousands of police with shields blocked the protesters when theytried to march out of a city center subway station and move towardthe Blue House presidential palace to denounce Chun and PresidentRoh Tae-woo.   ``Arrest Chun Doo-hwan! Punish Roh Tae-woo!'' protesters yelled.   Some protesters lashed out with clubs and poles at riot policeblocking the way with shields as the two sides pushed and shovedeach other. But protesters were unable to break through.   About 1,500 protesters then marched through the main shoppingdistrict, yelling slogans and hurling leaflets into crowds ofonlookers on the sidewalks. A group of students hurled firebombs ata government office but did not cause any damage.   Riot police attacked the march from the rear, hurling tear gasgrenades into the column of protesters. Dozens of students foughtback with firebombs and rocks during a brief clash, but mostprotesters ran for cover.   Police had no word on arrests or injuries.   The protest was smaller than major protests Nov. 19 and 26 whenthousands of people demanding Chun's arrest clashed with police inSeoul. Thousands of people watched the protest Wednesday, but veryfew gave any sign of sympathy or support.   Some 200 students demanding the former president's arrest battledriot police with firebombs in a separate protest Wednesday inSongnam on Seoul's southern outskirts.   Dissident groups are demanding Chun be arrested and tried forhuman rights abuses and corruption under his authoritarian rule.   Chun went into rural exile last week after apologizing to thenation for abuses under his rule and saying he would turn overmillions of dollars in personal assets to the government. He hasdenied any personal wrongdoing.   The Australian Embassy in Seoul said Wednesday its government waschecking to determine if any of Chun's relatives or associates haddiverted official funds to Australia. The embassy said the checkswere being made at the request of the South Korean government.   Roh, trying to defuse the furor over Chun, was studying plansWednesday for a major government shake-up to remove vestiges of theold government. News reports Wednesday said a new cabinet wasexpected to be announced by early next week.   Political leaders also studied plans for reform of South Korea'spowerful national and military intelligence agencies to end theirdomestic spying and surveillance functions.   Government officials had no immediate response to a call Tuesdayby the Public Administration Reform Commission for drastic curbs onthe Agency for National Security Planning to end its use in domesticpolitics.   The agency, formerly known as the Korean Central IntelligenceAgency, and the military intelligence have traditionally play majorroles in domestic politics. Both agencies have operated againstanti-government groups of all kinds.   A former army chief of staff, Chung Sung-hwa, said Wednesdayduring National Assembly hearings that Chun and other top militaryofficers seized power after staging ``a mutiny'' in December 1979.   Chung accused the former president of acting out of greed forpower and said the incident almost sparked a major confrontationwithin the military.   Chun and Roh were among a group of generals who took powerfollowing the October 1979 assassination of President Park Chung-heeby his intelligence chief in a dispute over handling protests.   Chun and Roh have said they acted to save the nation from chaosand had no thoughts of taking power. Chun was a close protege ofpresident Park.   Chung, who was army chief, was arrested by Chun's militaryintelligence command for possible complicity in Park's death. He waslater dismissed from the army in disgrace after being demoted to thelowest rank of private.   Chung first made his accusation against Chun and Roh duringpresidential elections in December last year. Roh won the election.</TEXT></DOC>
