Fewer than 1 percent who have tried to obtain refugee status havereceived it and more than 100 have been jailed under a get-toughpolicy that began Tuesday to weed out ``frivolous'' applicationsbefore the immigrants travel farther into the country.   Immigration and Naturalization Service officials said Wednesdayit was too early to declare a trend, but the sharp drop inapplicants, from 233 on Tuesday to 51 the next, indicated the planwas deterring unqualified applications.   ``We can only speculate that the word has gotten out and many ofthose coming for purely economic reasons are not coming any more,''said INS Harlingen District spokeswoman Virginia Kice.   But immigration attorney Linda Yanez said immigrants will merelygo underground.   ``My guess is that most people are probably going to just taketheir chances and get apprehended,'' said Ms. Yanez, who helpedorganize attorneys to provide free representation for those deniedasylum under the new program.   ``If they get apprehended,'' Ms. Yanez said, ``then they'rebefore an immigration judge (to submit asylum applications), wherethey're going to get a fair hearing, as opposed to this kangaroocourt that they're conducting over there.''   The new one-day adjudication policy calls for the immediatearrest and detention of rejected asylum applicants, who are placedin deportation proceedings and kept in a detention center.   Of more than 300 who applied the first two days, only 2 weregranted refugee status Tuesday and none made the grade Wednesday.   INS Commissioner Alan C. Nelson said the intent of the new policywas to deter 100,000 Central Americans who he said otherwise wouldenter the southern tip of Texas this year with unfounded asylumclaims.   But immigration officials said some Central Americans may try tocross into the United States west of the Brownsville area, wherepatrols have not been stepped up.   The Border Patrol has added 160 agents to Brownsville, which liesat the state's southern tip 15 miles southwest of here.   Processing of asylum applications previously took weeks andinvolved relaying information to and from Washington. Immigrants whowere denied asylum were freed on their own recognizance whileawaiting appeals or deportation.   Political asylum is granted to those fleeing persecution. INSofficials contend that most Central Americans are here to betterthemselves economically, and do not qualify for asylum.   More than 40,000 people have applied for asylum in southern Texassince the INS noted a dramatic increase in Central Americanapplicants last spring. A total of 631 applied Monday, the last daythey could travel farther into the United States to pursue theircases.   The agency has added extra staff and brought in State Departmentofficials to issue on-the-spot asylum decisions. Officials say itwill take several weeks to bring 500 federal workers to the area tofully implement the program.   The INS said 118 single adults denied asylum on Tuesday weredetained at the INS Port Isabel Service Processing Center, aminimum-security prison 15 miles from the border city ofBrownsville. They were held for deportation under bonds of $1,000 to$4,000 and issued orange prison jumpsuits.   For Richard Jesus Rivera, prison ended a five-day journey fromhis home in Ulsulutan, El Salvador.   ``I don't have the money for the bond. But I hope that my aunt inNew York might be able to send it to me. I don't want to go back toEl Salvador because there is too much danger because of the fightingand besides, there aren't any jobs,'' Rivera said Wednesday.   Single adults are kept in the prison, while family groups aresent to an American Red Cross shelter in Brownsville, where theymust answer daily roll calls under the auspices of the JusticeDepartment's Community Relations Service.   The two granted asylum the first day were a 32-year-old formerconstruction worker from Managua, who plans to settle in Miami, anda 65-year-old Nicaraguan businessman and accountant living inBrownsville, according to the INS.   ``It was felt by the examiner that they did meet the criteria,and if they were forced to return to their country they faced awell-founded fear of persecution,'' said Ms. Kice, the INSspokeswoman.</TEXT></DOC>
