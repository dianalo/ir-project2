French people are supposed to be haughty and argumentative, take three hours for lunch, spend all of August on the Riviera, speak only French, export only wine and perfume, grow fat and lazy on socialism, and worry only about the greater glory of France.    So what are the French doing smiling at foreigners, gulping sandwiches between appointments, working nearly as many hours on the average as the Germans, saying &quot;You're welcome&quot; when somebody says &quot;Merci,&quot; selling auto parts to Detroit, practicing economics straight out of Adam Smith, and doing more to foster a unified Europe than anybody else?    They are, increasingly, joining the modern world.    Shaking off decades of outmoded practices dating from Louis XIV and Napoleon Bonaparte, pressing for the natural leadership role they see for themselves in a united Europe, playing for all it's worth their nuclear card in a disarming world, the French are becoming more predictable and more valuable partners.    Some of the changes began as long as two decades ago, after the 1968 student revolt. Others date from the failure of Socialist reflation in 1981. Still others picked up steam during the past two years of conservative government. Now, the French say, the changes seem entrenched, the direction irreversible, the pace accelerating.    The most recent and perhaps the most surprising changes have come in politics. For 50 years, left and right have presented mutually exclusive and often equally ineffective solutions to French problems, with disgruntled militants taking up Parisian paving stones when agitated. In power, the left would undo what the right had just done, and vice versa.    French voters are trying to climb out of this box. The platform of freshly re-elected President Francois Mitterrand is socialist with a very, very small &quot;s.&quot; France can't waste time renationalizing and denationalizing companies every few years, Mr. Mitterrand says. French companies should be left alone. The political vogue words are &quot;openness,&quot; &quot;consensus&quot; and &quot;modernization.&quot; The voters like these words; by giving the Socialists only a modest edge in Sunday's first round of voting for a new parliament, they have probably ensured a moderate, not radical, government.    Unlike the fire-breathing first Mitterrand administration in 1981, which included four Communist cabinet members, the new government, even with a projected Socialist parliamentary majority, oozes moderation. Prime Minister Michel Rocard, who enjoys using his fluent English, likes to say he would be a right-wing Democrat in the U.S. His first action was to lift the last remaining foreign-exchange controls; his second was to accept the outgoing conservative government's budget for next year.    The business community is already open for business. Companies are starting to borrow money and take risks. Executives are getting stock options. The small investor has traded in his gold coins for stock in privatized companies. Unions and the Communist Party are in decline. Entrepreneurs are a la mode. New and perhaps lasting jobs are being created a few at a time, mainly in services.    However familiar to Americans, all this is new, and jolting, to the French. The pressure for change comes largely from France's need to catch up economically with West Germany before most European trade barriers fall in 1992. After that, it's going to be harder, if not impossible, to keep protecting inefficient French industry from German as well as American and Japanese competition.    Despite being seen as competitors, American companies should find an ever warmer welcome here. Paris has just launched a marketing campaign to attract more multinational corporate headquarters in general and U.S.-based companies in particular. International Business Machines Corp., France's largest corporate taxpayer, is being joined by more U.S. companies that want a window on Europe and like the well-educated, decreasingly unionized and increasingly friendly French work force.    French businessmen are convinced that they will overtake West Germany within five years, riding on exports of high-tech products such as high-speed trains and the Minitel, a two-way computer-information system. After that? &quot;Nobody should expect the French to ever work as hard as, say, the South Koreans,&quot; says Jacques Maisonrouge, a former IBM executive who now helps promote French exports. But &quot;we have finally become conscious that it's the productive sector, not the state, that produces riches,&quot; he adds. &quot;It's not a fad; it's the discovery of a basic fact.&quot;    Another fact: &quot;The French have accepted that they're no longer a nation able to control their own destiny,&quot; says Theodore Zeldin, an Oxford University professor who writes extensively about France. &quot;They now know that in today's world, France can't have an economic policy or industrial system totally at odds with everybody else.&quot;    By both conforming and opening up, the French hope to influence, if not control, as much of their destiny as they can. The response to the challenge of Europe is typical: France has embraced 1992 with incredible enthusiasm, figuring that it will have a bigger global role in running a unified Europe than France could have alone. If there is to be a president of a United States of Europe, the French think they have the obvious candidate: former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing.    France knows that its national defense rests on both the U.S. and West Germany. France will keep its nuclear weapons as long as it can, but as a backup, French troops regularly join the Germans in joint exercises. Despite remaining outside the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's military wing, the French are quietly allowing access to French ports for bigger and bigger U.S. ships patrolling the Mediterranean; the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower recently became the first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier to visit Marseille. U.S. Navy pilots now routinely get permission to fly low-level bombing practice over French farmland.    Much is being done to scrap outmoded institutions designed for times of past glory but leading only to genteel poverty in a world dominated by the U.S. and Japan. Napoleon's system of centralized administration is finally being scrapped. Mayors can now grant home-building permits much faster than Paris bureaucrats did; such construction is booming. In a big defeat for the once-powerful sugar-beet lobby and former French colonies in Africa, soon the weight-conscious here will finally be allowed to buy diet soft drinks.    The effects of all this on France are mixed. Take the once-sacrosanct French view of food. Fast food, a concept once so abhorrent here that the Academie Francaise never bothered to invent a French word for it, now accounts for one meal in 10. Smelling profit, French entrepreneurs are reinventing le fast-food. There are French machines to make omelets in 20 seconds, French machines to dispense microwavable canard a l'orange and a French high-tech baguette filler.    Taking a long loaf of fresh bread, Henri Caudron sticks in a menacing-looking plastic sword, squeezes a trigger and voila! blanquette de veau, dubbed a &quot;real meal in a sandwich&quot; for 18 francs ($3.15). It looks like gray glop. It tastes like gray glop. But it's already being served in 200 cafes, and Mr. Caudron has his eye on the U.S. &quot;There's nothing like this in America,&quot; the 22-year-old salesman crows.    Probably not. But France, for better or worse, now has American-style hostile takeovers, leveraged buy-outs, venture-capital funds and financial futures. The French even have disgraced yuppies, known here as &quot;les golden boys.&quot; Entrepreneurs, though still thin on the ground, are no longer shunned. France's flashiest businessman, Bernard Tapie, is running for parliament in a Marseille district, and he may win the runoff vote.    &quot;Everybody looked at us like we were nuts when my brother and I started making machines in a garage in Bordeaux&quot; 15 years ago, Jean Etcheparre says. His Lectra Systemes now has 1,000 employees and nearly $100 million of annual sales of its precision laser fabric-cutters. &quot;Nobody thinks we're nuts anymore,&quot; he adds.    The modernization of France's spirit is most visible in the education system, which for decades prided itself on producing rigidly trained, rigidly thinking bureaucrats. Roger Fauroux, who heads the prestigious Ecole Nationale d'Administration (from which both Prime Minister Rocard and his predecessor, Jacques Chirac, graduated), decided last year to slash ENA's enrollment. He said more of France's best and brightest should go to business and professional schools and more ENA graduates should go into business, not the bureaucracy. Mr. Rocard has just made Mr. Fauroux minister of industry.    The young are taking the hint. Patrick Mayette, a 25-year-old Parisian, was accepted at ENA but decided instead to go to the French equivalent of the Harvard Business School, the Ecole de Haute Etudes Commerciales. Three years ago, Mr. Mayette joined Lectra Systemes, the Bordeaux machine-tool company, and now he supervises 35 Japanese employees and sells $15 million a year of French cloth-cutting machines in Japan.    &quot;Business is adventure,&quot; says the clean-cut, rosy-cheeked Mr. Mayette, smartly dressed in the broad-striped shirt and narrow silk tie that are the uniform of the French yuppie. &quot;Business is today's human adventure.&quot;    Such thoughts are sweet music to French politicians who have been struggling for such changes for years. &quot;Until the late 1960s, our whole educational system was based on central planning,&quot; says former President Giscard d'Estaing. &quot;The heroes were the planners at ENA. It's a lasting change; the idea of going back to a planned economy has no meaning for France.&quot; He notes that his sons work in companies. And last year one of his daughters started a publishing house that immediately struck a best seller: his memoirs.    Despite all the changes, Frenchmen are trying hard to retain a certain French style, especially in crucial matters. Like clothes. One evening last fall, the French fashion industry threw the world's biggest and most spectacular fashion show on a gigantic outdoor runway opposite the Eiffel Tower. In a dramatic sign of openness, the first part of the show included sturdy-looking West German fashions, sturdier-looking Russian designs, exotic Saudi Arabian models led in by 20 camels, and sporty Americans emerging from shocking-pink convertibles.    Then, the main event. French coutouriers treated their rivals to a virtuoso display of more than 900 models wearing French furs, French evening gowns and French bathing suits. The French portion of the show went on twice as long as all the foreign displays combined. By the time the last firework exploded over the Eiffel Tower, the message was clear: France is more open, but it's still France.    ---          France's Economy: A Statistical Portrait                     VITAL STATISTICS    1986 Population:         55.4 Million    Area:                    220,668 sq. miles    1987 G.N.P.:             $910 billion    Est. 1988 Real Growth:   2.0%    1987 Inflation Rate:     3.0%    1987 Jobless Rate:       10.8%    Current Exchange Rate:   5.8 FF = $1                      PER CAPITA GNP    Adjusted for differences in relative purchasing power    United States      $17,324    Canada             $16,105    Germany            $12,741    Japan              $12,399    FRANCE             $12,218    Britain            $11,498    Italy              $11,406                  WHAT FRANCE EXPORTS    1987 exports broken down by category, in percent    Manufactured goods       43%    Machinery equipment      36%    Food andamp; beverage          15%    Raw materials             4%    Fuels                     2%                   WHERE THE EXPORTS GO    Leading destinations' share of 1987 exports, in percent    European community       60%    U.S./Canada               8%    OPEC                      4%    East-bloc         2%    Japan                     2%              BBLIC COMPANIES   Ranked by 1987 marketcaialztin,illions of dollars    Elf Aquitane      $.
