Personsholding more than five percent of a class of subject securities at theend of the calendar year, but not required to report on Schedule 13D, mustfile a short-form Schedule 13G within 45 days after December 31.

Rule 13d-1(b)(1)(ii)[17 CFR 240.13d-1(b)(ii)].Based upon its experience in administering the beneficial ownership rules,the Commission is proposing changes to improve the meaningfulness to investorsof filings on Schedule 13D, while at the same time reducing the reportingobligations of passive non-institutional investors, who would become entitledto use the short-form Schedule 13G instead of the Schedule 13D.\1\\4\<NOTE/> The Commission preliminarily believes that Schedule 13G providesadequate information when the filing person has a passive investment purpose_thatis, when the acquisition is not for the purpose, and does not have theeffect, of changing or influencing the control of the issuer, and the personis not participating in a transaction having such a purpose or effect.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\ The Commission also has recommended to Congress thatthe period for filing an initial beneficial ownership report be reducedfrom ten days to five business days and that the filing person be prohibitedfrom acquiring additional securities until the filing is made with theCommission. In addition, the Commission has endorsed the imposition ofcivil penalties for violations of section 13(d). <T3>See</T3> Statement of David S. Ruder, Chairman of the Securities andExchange Commission, Before the House Subcommittee on Telecommunicationsand Finance, September 17, 1987, and Statement of Charles C. Cox, ActingChairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Before the Senate Committeeon Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, June 23, 1987.The proposed amendments would alter the present beneficial ownership reportingscheme in a number of ways. In addition to the two current categories ofSchedule 13G filers (institutional investors and persons reporting exemptacquisitions), a third category (passive non-institutional investors) wouldbe created, significantly expanding the classes of persons eligible tofile on the short-form. An institutional investor would continue to beable to file a short-form report on Schedule 13G 45 days after the year'send, provided that the requirements of current Rule 13d-1(b)(1) are satisfiedand the institutional investor's beneficial ownership does not equal orexceed 20 percent of the class at any time. Any other person who acquiresor holds, with a passive investment purpose, more than five percent (butnot 20 percent or more) of a class of subject securities also would bepermitted to file a short-form report on Schedule 13G, rather than thelong-form report on Schedule 13D currently required for most investors,within 10 days after the acquisiton. Exempt acquisitions also would bereported on Schedule 13G within a 10-day period but would not be subjectto the 20 percent or more limitation.Both institutional and non-institutional Schedule 13G filers that determinedthat they could no longer make the passive investment purpose certificationwould be required to file a Schedule 13D within 10 days of a change inpurpose. A non-exempt acquisition causing any person, including an institutionalinvestor, to own beneficially 20 percent or more of a class of subjectsecurities also would disqualify that person from filing on Schedule 13Gand trigger a requirement for a Schedule 13D filing within 10 days. Aninvestor required to file a Schedule 13D because it either had changedits investment purpose or acquired 20 percent or more of a class of subjectsecurities would be subject to a waiting period (``cooling-off period'')during which such person could not vote or direct the voting of the subjectsecurities, or acquire an additional beneficial ownership interest in anysecurities either of the issuer or of any person controlling the issuer.An investor required to file a Schedule 13D because it acquired 20 percentor more of a class of subject securities would be subject to a cooling-offperiod only until the filing of a Schedule 13D. However, an investor thatmust file a Schedule 13D because of a change in investment purpose wouldbe subject to a cooling-off period from the time of the change in investmentintent until the expiration of the tenth day from the date of the filingof a Schedule 13D. The current cooling-off period applicable only to institutionalinvestors \1\\5\<NOTE/> would not be retained.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ Rule 13d-1(b)(3)(ii) [17 CFR 240.13d-1(b)(3)(ii)].As is required currently, amendments to disclose any other changes in theinformation reported on Schedule 13G would be required only on an annualbasis,\1\\6\<NOTE/> so long as beneficial ownership does not exceed 10 percentof the class of subject securities, calculated at the end of the monthwhen that ownership level is reached.\1\\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ Rule 13d-2(b) [17 CFR 240.13d-2(b)].<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ Rule 13d-1(b)(2) [17 CFR 240.13d-1(b)(2)]. Under theproposal, this provision would apply to both institutional and non-institutionalinvestors, but not to persons reporting exempt acquisitions.A chart summarizing the current reporting obligations and the effects ofthe proposed rule amendments appears below in Part III.F.Finally, the Commission is proposing technical amendments to the beneficialownership rules. First, the proposed amendments would require that a copyof a Schedule 13D or 13G, or amendments thereto, filed with respect toholdings of a class of securities quoted on the National Association ofSecurities Dealers Automated Quotation System (``NASDAQ'') be providedto the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'') to parallelthe requirements for exchange-traded securities. Second, proposed amendmentsto Rule 13d-1(c) would delete as no longer necessary the grandfather provisionsadopted in 1978. Additional related and clarifying amendments also areproposed. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Background</ITAG>As part of the Williams Act Amendments of 1968,\1\\8\<NOTE/> Congress added section 13(d) to the Exchange Act to requireany person (or group of persons) who, as a result of an acquisiton, becomesthe beneficial owner of more than five percent of a class of equity securitiesregistered under section 12 of the Exchange Act or other subject securities\1\\9\<NOTE/> to send to the issuer of the security and to each exchangeon which the security is traded and to file with the Commission a reportdisclosing the acquistion and other information about the acquiror andits plans or proposals within 10 days after the acquisition. Section 13(d)was intended to provide information to the public and the subject companyabout accumulations of its equity securities in the hands of persons whothen would have the potential to change or influence control of the issuer.\2\\0\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ Pub.

Acquisitons of additional securitiesare subject to the exemption in section 13(d)(6)(B). </ITAG><T3>See Harold Martin</T3> (available October 4, 1979).  The exemptions created gaps in the beneficial ownership reporting schemepermitting persons to own more than five percent of a class of subjectsecurities without reporting such ownership. In 1977, Congress enactedsection 13(g) of the Exchange Act\3\\1\<NOTE/> to provide for a comprehensive system of disclosure of ownershipinterests.\3\\2\<NOTE/> Section 13(g) requires any person who is directly or indirectlythe beneficial owner or more than five percent of a class of subject securitiesat the end of the calendar year, except for the issuer of the securities,to send to the issuer and file with the Commission a statement of Schedule13G. Section 13(g) was intended to improve disclosure to issuers and themarketplace and to ``supplement [section 13(d)] by providing legislativeauthority for certain additional disclosure requirements that in some casescould not be imposed administratively.''\3\\3\<NOTE/> On the face, section 13(g) woudld require a filing regardlessof whether a person was required to report ownership under other sectionsof the Exchange Act; however, the Commission was directed ``to take suchsteps as are necessary and appropriate in the public interest to achievecentralized reporting of the information, to avoid unnecessary duplicativereporting, and to minimize the compliance burden on persons required toreport.''\3\\4\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\1\15 U.S.C. 78m(g).  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\2\In addition, as part of the Securities Act Amendmentsof 1975, Congress enacted section 13(f) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C.78m(f)] to create in the Commission a central depository of historicaland current data about the investment activities of institutional investmentmanagers and to facilitate consideration of the influence and impact ofinstitutional investment managers on securities markets and the publicpolicy implications of that influence.

Discussion of Proposals</ITAG>The beneficial ownership reporting scheme is intended to inform the marketplaceof acquisitions of a company's securities that could affect control. Underthe legislative framework, both the occurrence of the acquisition and thepurpose for which the acquiror is accumulating securities are deemed materialdisclosures. However, the current scheme requires most persons to filedetailed disclosure reports regardless of investment purpose. As a result,the scheme may place an unnecessary reporting obligation on persons whoseacquistions do not involve the concerns of the Williams Act.The Commission is proposing amendments to Regulations 13D-G to make beneficialownership disclosure more useful to investors, the marketplace and theCommission and to reduce significantly the requirements that the currentreporting scheme imposes on persons with a passive investment purpose.These changes would enhance the comprehensive framework of disclosure contemplatedby Congress. Since all non-institutional investors with a passive investmentpurpose could be the short-form Schedule 13G within 10 days of the triggeringevent, the mere filing of a Schedule 13D would serve to notify the marketplaceof an acquisition by a person with a possible control intent. The reducednumber of Schedule 13D filings would allow the marketplace, as well asthe staff of the Commission, to focus more quickly on acquisitions involvinga potential change in control.\4\\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\42\ In fiscal year 1988, 2,850 original Schedules 13D and6,927 amendments were filed with the Commission.A. Expanding the Classof Persons Using Schedule 13GThe purposes underlying section 13(d) do not require the extensive disclosurecurrently elicited by Schedule 13D for investors whose acquisitions havea passive investment purpose. However, the vast majority of persons filingon Schedule 13D have such a passive intent, but are not eligible to usethe abbreviated disclosure document, Schedule 13G. Data provided by theCommission's Office of Economic Analysis indicate that 74 percent of theSchedule 13D studied reported no intention to change control of the issuerat the time of the initial filing.\4\\3\<NOTE/> Further, only 10 percent of these persons amended their originalintent disclosure from ``investment'' to ``change in control'' over a two-yearperiod following the date of the original filing.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\43\ The results of this sample of 100 Schedules 13D filedin calendar year 1985 were comparable to those derived from an earlierstudy of 200 filings of Schedule 13D from fiscal year 1981.The Commission is proposing that this significant pool of investors havingsolely a pasive investment purpose with respect to their ownership of morethan five percent of a class of subject securities be permitted to fileon Schedule 13G instead of Schedule 13D. Under the proposed amendments,Rules 13d-1(a) and 13d-2(a) would continue to require that persons whoacquire beneficial ownership of more than five percent of the securitiesof the issuer file a Schedule 13D within 10 days after crossing the thresholdand thereafter promptly amend that statement to disclose changes in ownershiplevels. Rule 13d-1(b)(1) would continue to permit an institutional investoracquiring subject securities in the ordinary course of its business tofile a Schedule 13G within 45 days after the calendar year's end, providedthat the conditions of the rule are satisfied. Proposed Rule 13d-(b)(2)also would permit any other investor, institutional or non-institutional,that acquires or holds more than five percent of a class of subject securitieswith a passive investment purpose to use a Schedule 13G in lieu of a Schedule13D.\4\\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\44\ Individuals controlling eligible institutions are theindirect beneficial owners of securities held by the institutions and thushave an obligation under section 13(d) and Rule 13d-1 to report those holdings.<T3>See in re The Gabelli Group, Inc.,</T3> Release No. 34-26005 (August17, 1988). The staff has permitted individuals to file Schedules 13G jointlyunder Rule 13d-1(f) with an institution within their control where theindividual owns directly, or indirectly through an ineligible entity, lessthan one percent of the company's stock and does not intend to change orinfluence contol of the company. <T3>See Warren E. Buffet and Berkshire Hathaway, Inc.</T3> (available December5, 1986). To meet this obligation, the individual signs a separate Schedule13G cover sheet and signs the Schedule in his individual capacity. <T3>See</T3> Schedule 13G, Instruction (1) and Notes for Cover Page andItem 10; 17 CFR 240.13d-102.<ITAG tagnum="28">While the proposed amendments would remove any obstacle to the individualreporting beneficial ownership on a Schedule 13G with respect to passiveinvestments, because of the timing differnce in the filing of the Scheduleby individuals and eligible institutions, the staff will continue its no-actionposition to allow the control person to report indirect beneficial ownershipthrough the controlled entity 45 days after the end of the calendar year,rather than 10 days after the person's indirect beneficial ownership exceedsfive percent.</ITAG>A person with a passive investment purpose filing on Schedule 13G wouldhave to disclose general information about its identity, residence andcitizenship, and a description of the nature of the interest in the subjectsecurities. Unlike the Schedule 13D, the Schedule 13G does not requiredisclosure of the source and amount of funds used or to be used for theacquisition; the purpose for which the acquisition was made; all transactionsin the subject securities for the past 60 day; or contracts or arrangementswith respect to the subject securities. With the extension of Schedule13G to non-professional investors, the passive investment purpose certificationwould be revised to make the ``ordinary course of business'' requirementinapplicable to such persons.Persons that cannot certify solely a passive investment purpose becauseof the current possibility that they may seek to exercise or influencecontrol as an alternative investment purpose would be required to fileon a Schedule 13D and would not be eligible to use a Schedule 13G. In essence,the proposed reporting system would divide persons with beneficial ownershipof more than five and less than 20 percent of subject securities into twogroups_those persons with a passive investment purpose permitted to fileon Schedule 13G, and all other persons required to file on Schedule 13D.\45\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\45\ The only exception would be Schedules 13G filed withrespect to exempt acquisitions pursuant to current Rule 13d-1(c) (proposedto be retained with some modifications as discussed below). Such scheduleswould not include a certification of the filer's passive investment purpose.The current requirement that an institutional investor must certify thatthe subject securities were acquired in the ordinary course of business,as well as with a passive investment purpose, would be retained. The Commissionrequests comment, however, on whether the current form of the certification,requiring that the securities be acquired in the ordinary course of business,\46\<NOTE/> as a prerequisite to filing 45 days after the calendar year'send, should be retained, if the institutional investor acquires the subjectsecurities with a passive investment purpose. The proposed amendments wouldeliminate the requirement that an institutional investor that ceases tosatisfy the conditions of current Rule 13d-1(b)(1)(ii) file a Schedule13D. Like any person with a passive investment purpose, such a person wouldbe permitted to file an initial or amended Schedule 13G within 10 days.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\46\ Item 10, Schedule 13G. The Commission requests public comment on whether the use of Schedule 13Gfor passive investors should be mandatory, rather than voluntary as inthe current rule proposal. Specifically, comment is solicited on whetherthe purposes of the proposed rules adequately would separate persons witha passive investment purpose from those with a possible control intentor whether a sufficient number of persons with a passive intent would chooseto forego the lesser burdens of a Schedule 13G filing and file a Schedule13D. Passive investors may choose to file on Schedule 13D because of thecooling-off period that accompanies the use of Schedule 13G. Use of Schedule13D by passive investors could undermine the effectiveness of the schedulesas a means to delineate between filers with a passive investment purposeand those with the intent to change or influence control. Comment alsois requested on whether the currently permissive filing of Schedules 13Gunder Rule 13d-1(b)(1) by institutional investors acquiring or holdingsubject securities in the ordinary course of business should be made mandatory.B. Ten Day Initial Filing Obligation for Non-institutional Beneficial Ownersof More Than Five Percent; Timing for Amendments Under the current reporting system, a Schedule 13D must be filed within10 days after acquiring more than five percent of a subject security. Incontrast, a Schedule 13G need not be filed until 45 days after the endof the calendar year in which the filing obligation arose, if beneficialownership is more than five percent at the year's end. Except for an institutionalinvestor acquiring the subject securities in the ordinary course of itsbusiness, the proposed amendments would require that any person filinga Schedule 13G, including a filing reflecting an exempt acquisition, filewithin 10 days of the triggering event.\47\<NOTE/> Thus, the market and shareholders would receive more timelynotice of the creation and existence of voting blocks that have the potentialof affecting control of the issuer. Obtaining the short-form informationmore promptly is important even when the investment purpose is passive,because the existence of a large block of securities has control implications,regardless of the intentions of the current holder of the block.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\47\ Proposed Rules 13d-1 (b)(2) and (c).As is currently required for an institutional investor, a non-institutionalinvestor would file a Schedule 13G or amendment thereto within 10 daysafter the end of the first month in which such person's direct or indirectbeneficical ownership exceed 10 percent of the class of subject securities,and thereafter within 10 days after the end of the month in which suchperson's beneficial ownership increases or decreases by more than fivepercent since the previous filing. Amendments to disclose any other changeswould continue to be required only on an annual basis. Institutional investors acquiring subject securities in the ordinary courseof business would continue to file the Schedule 13G 45 days after the endof the calendar year to report holdings of more than five percent as ofDecember 31. This distinction has been maintained due to the substantialnumber of positions reported by institutional investors on Schedule 13G.\48\<NOTE/> Changes in the beneficial ownership reporting requirementsfor institutional investors could impose a substantial financial and operationalburden.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\48\ Approximately 3,700 initial Schedules 13G and 5,990 amendmentswere filed in fiscal year 1987. Data from Schedules 13G with a reportingdate of December 31, 1987 indicate that at least half of the filings weremade by a broker or dealer, bank, insurance company, investment company,investment adviser or employee benefit plan. Although the Commission does not propose to accelerate the filing dateof the Schedule 13G for institutional investors, the experience of recentyears has made clear that control is affected not only by a beneficialowner's own intentions of directly affecting control of an issuer, butalso the use to which the acquiror may lend its voting power, or the intentof a person to whom it may sell the block. The concentration of votingpower in a single block and its transferability are material informationto the market. Furthermore, recent enforcement actions have provided examplesof the use of illegal parking of securities involving market professionalsto avoid, among other legal requirements, Schedule 13D disclosures andobligations under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.\49\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\49\ 15 U.S.C. 18a.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><T3>See e.g., SEC </T3>v. <T3>First City Financial, </T3>688 F. Supp. 705 (D.D.C. 1988); <T3>SEC </T3>v. <T3>Boyd L. Jefferies, et al.</T3>, Lit. Rel. No. 11370 (March 19, 1987).To obtain disclosure about institutional holdings that could play a rolein a control contest, the Commission could require that institutional investorsfile Schedule 13G on a 10-day, monthly or quarterly basis, and/or requirethe reporting of all five percent positions, not just those in existenceat the end of the relevant period. The Commission requests specific commenton the effect requiring institutional investors to file on a more timelybasis would have on block positioning and marketmaking for a particularsecurity. The Commission is concerned about the potential disruptive effectof an accelerated reporting obligation on the legitimate, day-to-day businessoperations of institutional investors_particularly with respect to marketmakers_as well as their ability, on a cost-effective basis, to comply withincreased reporting requirements. Data are requested on the frequency withwhich broker-dealers or other market professionals hold more than fivepercent positions that are not required to be reported at the calendaryear's end. The Commission also requests information as to the nature ofadditional procedures that would be necessary to monitor for these positionsand the associated costs of such procedures.  C. Filing of Schedule 13D and Cooling-Off Period for Changes in InvestmentIntent  Under the current rules, institutional investors who have filed a Schedule13G but who can no longer make ordinary course of business and passiveinvestment representations must file a Schedule 13D ``promptly,'' but nolater than 10 days after a change in their investment purpose.\5\\0\<NOTE/> After filing the Schedule 13D, the institutional investoris prohibited from acquiring additional securites of the subject classor of a person controlling the issuer of the class, or voting the securitiesalready owned for a period of 10 days.\5\\1\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\0\Rule 13d-1(b)(3)(i) [17 CFR 240.13d-1(b)(3)(i)].  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\1\Rule 13d-1(b)(3)(ii) [17 CFR 240.13d-1(b)(3)(ii)]. The proposed rule would extend the concept of a cooling-off period to anypassive investor filing on Schedule 13G (except for those with only exemptacquisitions) that determines that it no longer holds the subject securitieswith a passive investment purpose. As proposed, the cooling-off periodfor a change in investment purpose would begin to run from the time ofthe determination of the change in investment intent until the expirationof the tenth day from the date of the filing of a Schedule 13D. A Schedule13D would be required no later than 10 days after a change in investmentpurpose. The proposed rule would delete the reference to ``promptly''\5\\2\<NOTE/> and require the filing of a Schedule 13D within 10 days toparallel the original Schedule 13D filing obligation.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\2\The deletion of the word ``promptly'' from current Rule13d-3 [17 CFR 240.13d-3] should eliminate any possible misperception that``promptly,'' in the context of a Regulation 13D-G filing, would be satisfiedby a 10-day filing. <T3>See</T3> n. 36, <T3>supra.</T3>  The proposed cooling-off period is necesssary and appropriate when thebeneficial owner determines that it no longer holds the securities witha passive investment purpose and may seek to influence control The proposedapproach would encourage the prompt filing of a Schedule 13D and preventfurther acquisitions or the voting of the subject securities until themarket and investors have been given time to react to the information inthe Schedule 13D filing. The extension of a cooling-off period until tendays from the date of the required filing on Schedule 13D also would serveas a deterrent to the improper use of the Schedule 13G by persons seekingto influence control.  Comment is requested on whether the ten day period is necessary at all,or whether the period should be changed to a shorter period, such as threeor five business days, or a longer period, such as fifteen days. Further,the Commission requests comment on whether such a provision would adequatelydiscourage the improper use of a Schedule 13G by persons that may seekto influence control.D. Limit on Ownership Interest Reportable on Schedule 13G and Cooling-offPeriodProposed Rule 13d-1(b)(1) would include a provision restricting the useof Schedule 13G (except for exempt acquisitions) by limiting the aggregateamount of securities that could be reported on that Schedule. The Commissionis proposing to use a 20 percent threshold to balance the increased reportingburden and the need to provide detailed information about acquisitionsthat have significant control implications because of the size of the holdings.\5\\3\<NOTE/> As with the case of a change in passive investment purpose,acquisitions causing a person beneficially to own 20 percent or more ofthe class would require the holder to file a Schedule 13D within 10 daysafter the acquisition and subject the filer to a cooling-off period. Unlikethe comparable cooling-off period for changes in investment intent, thecooling-off period only would run from the time the threshold is reacheduntil the filing of the Schedule 13D.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\3\ The amended rule is not intended to create a presumptionthat a person beneficially owning 20 percent or more of a class of subjectsecurities has control or an actual control purpose.The Commission requests comment on whether a 20 percent threshold levelof stock ownership is the appropriate threshold at which to require personswith a purported passive investment purpose to report on Schedule 13D.At some level, a block of securities has inherent control implicationsbecause of its size and its potential for movement. The market and investorsshould receive notice of the block's existence and the information elicitedby Schedule 13D, as well as prompt amendment to that information, includingchanges in the block's size. Commentators should address whether a 10 percentthreshold, paralleling current requirements for amendment of a Schedule13G and the 10 percent threshold for reporting under section 16,\5\\4\<NOTE/> is more appropriate, or whether a higher threshold shouldbe adopted. Finally, the Commission requests comment on the appropriatenessand length of the 10 day filing and cooling-off periods in this context.As discussed in Part III.C. above, the Commission also requests commenton when the cooling-off period should begin to run.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\4\ 15 U.S.C. 78p.E. Related and Clarifying AmendmentsThe Commission also is proposing related amendments to the beneficial ownershipreporting requirements. Amendments are proposed to current Rules 13d-1(b),13d-2, 13d-7 and Schedules 13D and 13G.\5\\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\5\ 17 CFR 240.13d-1(b), 13d-1(b)(1)(iii), 13d-(1)(c),13d-2(b), 13d-3(d)(3), and 13d-5(b)(2)(i).Current Regulation 13D-G requires the sending of the Schedule 13D and amendmentsto each exchange on which the security is traded. Schedules 13G and amendments,on the other hand, are only required to be sent to the principal exchangeon which the securities is traded, if any. Since Schedule 13G would becomethe primary reporting document in many cases, the Commission proposes torequire that a copy of each Schedule 13G and amendment be provided to eachexchange on which the security is traded. Schedules 13G for exempt acquisitions,however, would continue to be sent only to the issuer at its principalexecutive offices and filed with the Commission, as provided by currentRule 13d-1(c). Amendments to Schedules 13G relating to exempt acquisitionswould be treated similarly and no longer be required to be sent to an exchange,as is currently required by Rule 13d-2(b).As a related matter, the Commission also proposes to require that a copyof a Schedule 13D, Schedule 13G or amendment filed to report ownershipof a class of securities quoted on NASDAQ (except for those reflectingexempt acquisitions), and any amendments, be provided to the NASD.Proposed amendments to Rule 13d-1(c) would delete as no longer necessarythe grandfather provisions adopted in 1978 to facilitate the transitionto reporting on Schedule 13G for persons whose holdings previously werenot subject to any disclosure requirements. Persons with exempt acquisitionswould continue to report beneficial ownership on Schedule 13G pursuantto revised Rule 13d-1(c).The Commission also is proposing technical and clarifying amendments toRegulation 13D-G. Amendments to Rules 13d-1 and 13d-2 would make clearthat a total of six copies (one signed original plus five copies) mustbe filed with the Commission under the current rules. Rule 13d-7 also wouldbe revised to clarify that a Schedule 13D filed with respect to holdingsreported until then on Schedule 13G, and vice versa, do not require anadditional fee, if beneficial ownership had not fallen below five percent.In accordance with current staff interpretations, when a reporting personceases to be eligible for Schedule 13G and must file a Schedule 13D, nonew fee will be imposed. Similarly, if a 13D filer subsequently meets thecriteria for use of Schedule 13G, no new fee will be imposed.Technical amendments also are proposed to Schedules 13D and 13G to conformthe schedules to the revised rules and amend the filing deadlines and thenumber of copies in the instructions.F.

Cost-Benefit Analysis</ITAG>To evaluate the benefits and costs associated with the proposed amendmentsto Exchange Act Rules 13d-1, 13d-2, and 13d-7, Schedule 13D, and Schedule13G, the Commission requests commentators to provide views and data asto the costs and benefits associated with amending the filing requirementsfor beneficial ownership statements. The ability to file a Schedule 13Ginstead of a Schedule 13D in specified circumstances should reduce costsfor persons meeting the requirements. Persons currently eligible to usea Schedule 13G based on holdings of subject securities at the end of thecalendar year may incur increased reporting and monitoring costs becauseacquisitions that cause a person to hold 20 percent or more of the subjectsecurities would be reported on Schedule 13D.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ITAG>The Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis concerns the proposed amendmentsto the Commission's beneficial ownership rules and related Schedules 13Dand 13G. The analysis has been prepared by the Commission in accordancewith 5 U.S.C. 604.The analysis notes that the principal effect of the revisions will be toreduce the filing obligations and associated costs to a majority of personsrequired to report beneficial ownership under sections 13(d) and 13(g)of the Exchange Act. Although specified categories of investors may incuran increased reporting or monitoring obligation, the Commission does notbelieve that there will be a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities.A copy of the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis may be obtained bycontacting Richard E.
