Environmental biotechnologyis at the interface between responsible disciplines in engineering, molecularbiology, and ecological sciences. The purpose of this research planningeffort was to define limitations in the current knowledge base and todevelop a research agenda and strategy that will lead to the successfulpractice of environmental biotechnology. The focus was specifically directedat environmental protection. However, it was recognized that the researchplan typifies a central research model for the future development ofeffective and ecologically sound biotechnology for other environmentalapplications. 25 refs., 1 fig.</TEXT></DOC>
