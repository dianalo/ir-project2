Traders described the market as simultaneously nervous,stagnant and stunned as dealers counted down the final hoursbefore the midnight deadline, after which the use of force toeject Iraq from Kuwait has been authorized.</LP><TEXT>   Late in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.5470 marks,up from 1.5443 marks late Monday in New York. The U.S.currency also was changing hands at 135.75 yen, up from135.13 yen in New York late Monday. Sterling was trading at$1.9085, up from $1.9035 late Monday.   In Tokyo early Wednesday, the dollar was trading at 136.18yen, up from Monday's Tokyo close of 135.35 yen. Japanesefinancial markets were closed Tuesday for a holiday. The U.S.currency also was trading early Wednesday at 1.5445 marks,down from 1.5488 marks at Monday's close.   Participants were &quot;hanging on every single rumor comingout. Every little bit of news makes everybody jump,&quot; saidAlexis McCarthy, corporate foreign exchange trader at BanqueIndosuez in New York.   But that edginess didn't translate into rate movements.With little tangible optimism for peace left in the market,players didn't want to let go of dollars.   &quot;Unless there is credible, and I mean very credible, newsthat there is going to be some kind of discussion, I can'tsee that {the dollar} would come off substantially,&quot; Ms.McCarthy added.   Hopes weren't raised even when the U.S. State Departmentsaid that it would take only one sentence from IraqiPresident Saddam Hussein indicating that Iraq would withdrawfrom Kuwait to resolve the crisis.   The French proposal to the United Nations outlining asix-point peace plan and subsequent rumors that Iraq mightaccept it caused some intraday drops in the dollar. But whenit was clear that the U.S. and the United Kingdom had strongobjections to the proposal the dollar drifted higher again.The U.S. has repeatedly come out against any linkage of thePalestine question with an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait andthe French proposal included an international peaceconference on the Mideast. Late in the day, France said itsproposal had drawn no response from Iraq.   Each new rumor of a peace plan in the offing unnerved themarket, but could only cause a severely limited reaction,noted Judy Rubenstein, vice president at Bank of America inLos Angeles. Further limiting trading was the closing ofJapanese trading Tuesday for the national Coming-of-AgeHoliday.   Participants didn't want to get &quot;stuck&quot; in a position,either overbought or oversold dollars, she added. Manyparticipants weren't even interested in arbitraging, orjockeying quickly in and out of positions for small profits,because at any moment news could explode, making an intradayposition impossible to reverse, said one trader in New York.   In what seemed to be typical of the day's tension andtrading restraint, Ms. McCarthy described Banque Indosuez'strading room as follows: &quot;We've got three TVs on, everyone'swatching their {news} screens, but there's not a lot oftrading going on.&quot;   With French Premier Michel Rocard saying late in the daythat the moment for force &quot;has, alas, arrived,&quot; and thatFrench initiatives for peace have elicited no response fromIraq, the market seemed to move out of the mode of warjitters and into one of blunt realism, said Frank Pusateri,vice president in corporate foreign exchange at the Bank ofBoston.   &quot;At this point there seems to be at least a tacitadmission&quot; that war is becoming more inevitable, Mr. Pusaterisaid.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for currentdelivery settled at $398.80 an ounce, down $1.30. Estimatedvolume was a very heavy 6.5 million ounces.   In early trading in Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was quotedat $400.75 an ounce.</TEXT></DOC>
