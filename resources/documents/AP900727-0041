As of early July, the Union of True Believers had registered79,000 members, making it second in size only to the rulingCommunist Party, which claims 98,000.   New members are joining hourly, said the union's chairman,Bayantsagaan, who like most Mongolians uses only one name.   ``It's like a river after a heavy rain,'' he said in aninterview this week at the union's headquarters in a traditionalnomad's tent, or ger, outside Gandan Temple in Ulan Bator.   When the Communists took power in Mongolia in 1921, they endedthe Buddhist monasteries' centuries-old role in politics. In the1930s, the Communists shut down more than 700 monasteries andforced the monks to find secular work. Religious worship was bannedand later tightly restricted.   Gandan was reopened in 1944, and until April it was thecountry's sole place of Buddhist worship.   But Bayantsagaan and others say most Mongolians continued topray in private. When the democratic revolution sweeping EasternEurope inspired Mongolians to demonstrate last winter and springfor an end to authoritarianism, Buddhist monks and lay believerstentatively ventured into the fray.   They held a protest of their own to demand monasteries bereopened and sent a letter to the legislature calling for an end togovernment control of religion.   They formed the Union of True Believers in March, and itestablished a political wing, the Mongolian Buddhist Party.   The party has yet to register with the government and so isineligible to put candidates forward in Mongolia's firstmulti-party legislative elections, being held Sunday.   But when the next elections are held, the Buddhists could win,said Bayarsuren, the party chairman, claiming strength in the``somons,'' the lowest administrative units in rural Mongolia.   ``In some somons, the entire population has joined themovement,'' he said. Somons usually have about 2,000 residents.   There are no figures for the percentage of Mongolia's 2 millionpeople who still adhere to Buddhism, but both men maintained thatit is a majority. They said young people are as interested inreligion as their elders.   Should the party win a future election, Bayarsuren said, itwould restore complete freedom of worship and re-establishtraditional links between Buddhism and government. ``Religion,government and people will be one,'' he said.   Even without joining in this year's election, the Buddhists havemade a more rapid comeback than was anticipated in March, when theCommunists pledged to allow political and religious freedoms.   At that time, the chief monk of Gandan Temple, Gaandan, said twomore temples would be reopened shortly but other restorations wouldproceed slowly and there would be no effort by the Buddhists totake political power.   Since then, however, Bayarsuren said, about 30 temples have beenreopened, using public donations.</TEXT></DOC>
