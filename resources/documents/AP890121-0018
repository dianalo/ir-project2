(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Fires set by inmates erupted Friday night in aprison south of Washington and authorities said an unknown number ofinmates were free within the sprawling complex. One inmate waskilled and one was injured, authorities said.   At least four fires were set in the Lorton Reformatory complex,according to authorities. The administration building of the centralfacility was destroyed by the flames, according to officials at themayor's command center.   District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry, accompanied by his wifeEffi, both dressed in formal clothes they wore to Friday night'sinaugural balls, arrived early today for a briefing.   The fires were at the corrections complex, which is operated bythe district and located about 20 miles south of the city. Themedium-security complex houses about 1,280 inmates from the districtin dormitories and has been the scene of numerous inmate protestsbecause of overcrowded conditions.   Pat Wheeler, a spokeswoman for the city corrections department,said one inmate was killed in the outbreak and another was injured.No details about the circumstances of those casualties wereimmediately available.   Ms. Wheeler said all inmates had been accounted for and none hadescaped from the complex.   Firefighters remained outside for about an hour while citycorrections officers herded inmates who had been loose in thecomplex onto a baseball field.   Lt. Mike Reilly of the Fairfax County, Va., Fire Department, saidfiremen did not try to put out the fires until it was certain thesituation was safe. ``Until we get an area that is confirmed secure,we are keeping our firefighters out,'' he said.   It was not clear how many buildings were on fire in the sprawlingcomplex, which sits in a wooded, rolling area near the PotomacRiver. One official said four buildings had fires, but there wereother reports that only two buildings were aflame.   Washington police were rushed to the area, including officers whohad been assigned to protection duties at inaugural balls around thecity. The galas were celebrating the inauguration of President Bushearlier Friday.   The fire did not disrupt Bush's schedule as he made the rounds ofinaugural events, but six police cars, their sirens wailing, sped byon their way to the prison just as the president's motorcade pulledup to a private dinner at the Organization of American Statesbuilding near the White House.   The incident began with a power failure about 9:15 p.m. at theprison's central facility.   With the lights out, fires were set by inmates in the building,said Ms. Wheeler.   ``We have no idea what specifically is going on inside'' thecentral facility, she said in answer to a question about thelocation of inmates.   Inmates were herded into a nearby baseball field where they werebeing guarded by police, Ms. Wheeler said.   The fires continued to burn several hours after the first alarmwas sounded.   Early today, D.C. fire units arrived to aid Fairfax firefighters.   FBI agents also went to the prison, said Ms. Wheeler. The FBIinvestigates crimes at the complex.   A district police helicopter hovered overhead and some inmateswere running loose in an open area within the prison complex.   The chronically overcrowded prison complex, made up of a seriesof smaller prisons, held a total of 6,165 inmates last month, whenthe district government asked a federal judge to bar newly sentencedfelons from the entering city institutions.   The city closed its doors to new inmates for six weeks last fall,opening them again only under a federal judge's order. The federalgovernment was forced to take charge of 300 city inmates during thattime.   The district has also sent more than 200 inmates to the states ofWashington and Tennessee.   Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., responding to the violence and frequentescapes from the facility, introduced legislation in Congress lastfall to give Virginia some control over the prison complex. At thetime, he said, ``The situation at Lorton reached crisis proportionsa decade ago, and it has continued to deteriorate.''   Although there have been isolated incidents at the complex,Friday night's outbreak was the largest since an inmate riot brokeout in July, 1986 at the Occoquan I and II facilities, two sectionswithin the Lorton institution. One inmate was killed by buckshotwounds to the head suffered when guards tried to quell the uprising.   Twenty-nine inmates, nine guards and three firefighters wereinjured in that riot. The fiery outbreak damaged 13 buildings andmany inmates were kept in temporary shelters for a time afterwards.   Edward Koren, an attorney with the National Prison Project of theAmerican Civil Liberties Union Foundation, said, ``This is notanything new, we have a long, sad history of overcrowding at thesefacilities. Inevitably, there are disturbances.''   ``It's really a very dangerous place. They claim it is mediumsecurity, but really its used for long timers. It's really just adormitory. There's a lot of violence, a lot of idlness, conditionsare poor, and that's a real dangerous mix.''   The district has been unable to build new facilities at thecomplex because of political opposition from Fairfax Countyofficials, who oppose the presence of the district prison and holdmore power than the city in Congress.</TEXT></DOC>
