Christensen said specifics had not been worked out, thoughpossibilities include several ideas recommended June 15 to top PBSofficials by the John and Mary Markle Foundation of New York.   The foundation has offered to contribute $5 million of theestimated $15 million to $20 million that the project would cost.   Developed by Alvin H. Perlmutter, an independent televisionproducer, the Markle study recommends that PBS offer free air timein blocks ranging from 2{ minutes to 15 minutes to the presidentialcandidates or the political parties.   Perlmutter, who has worked for PBS and NBC, recommended creatinga ``Voters Channel'' production company to prepare expandedpolitical programming for PBS stations that also would include``character and competence'' profiles of presidential candidatesand an exploration of their debates.   Regularly scheduled one-hour programs would be broadcast duringSeptember and October 1992, with half-hour programs airing dailythe week before the November general election.   The report also recommended that the programs include segmentsexamining political ads and party activities in the campaign andthe media's coverage of it. And it called for a segment in whichvoters could voice their views on the candidates and the issues.</TEXT><HEAD>Journalists Name Computer Maker in Injury Lawsuit</HEAD><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Eight journalists filed a $270 million lawsuitagainst a computer maker on June 15, contending they suffereddisabling injuries from using the company's word processors innewsrooms.   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, chargedthat Atex Publishing Systems, a subsidiary of the Eastman KodakCo., was negligent in marketing the computers and had failed towarn users of the dangers or to develop substitute systems.   It also alleged that the company ``ignored, suppressed ordisregarded'' medical studies about ``the causal relationshipbetween the repetitive use of computer systems and cumulativetrauma disorders.''   The journalists, each seeking $20 million in punitive damagesand $10 million in compensatory damages, included two from Newsday,two from American Banker and individual staffers at The AssociatedPress, New York Newsday, The Village Voice and Discount Store News.   Three spouses also asked $10 million each for loss ofcompanionship, bringing the total number of plaintiffs to 11.   None of the employers were named as defendants. Ruth Marcus, anattorney for the plaintiffs, said New York state law provides thatworkers cannot sue employers for work-related injuries but mustpursue such claims through workmen's compensation.   Eastman Kodak spokesman John Labella said the company had nocomment because its lawyers had not seen the suit.   It was the second lawsuit filed in New York in less than a monthagainst the company, which manufactures computer systems designedfor use in newsrooms. Three reporters and an editor at New YorkNewsday demanded $40 million in a negligence suit filed June 4 inManhattan Supreme Court.   The most recent filing alleged the eight journalists ``developedand suffered severe, permanent and disabling cumulative traumadisorders, as well as psychological injuries,'' from repeated useof the Atex video display terminals.   It said cumulative trauma disorders included ``repetitive straininjuries, musculoskeletal and nerve disorders, upper extremity painsyndrome, carpal tunnel syndrome, tendinitis and other injuries tothe upper extremities.''   The eight journalists named as plaintiffs are: Susan Harrigan ofNew York Newsday, Laurie Garrett and Sandra Peddie of Newsday,Martha Gioumousis of Discount Store News, Kathy Silberger of TheVillage Voice, Wendy Grover and David Neustadt of American Bankerand Anne Buckley of The Associated Press.
