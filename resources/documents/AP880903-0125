The death toll from the Aug. 28 accident reached 51 when a youngWest German died in a hospital in Ludwigsburg, officials said.   The service took place 1{ miles from the Ramstein U.S. Air ForceBase, where an Italian air force stunt team jet collided with twoother jets and crashed into a crowd of spectators. More than 160people remain hospitalized, many of them in serious condition withsevere burns.   Relatives of the victims wept uncontrollably throughout thetwo-hour service, which included the funeral march from Beethoven'sThird Symphony. West German President Richard von Weizsaecker ledthe memorial service, televised live nationwide.   Two elderly women who appeared nearly unable to walk because oftheir grief were helped to their seats in a section reserved formembers of victims' families.   As about 500 West German and American mourners entered the redbrick Church of St. Nicholas, a light rain fell on about 15protesters from a local women's peace group. The skies, usuallyfilled with the roar and whine of warplanes heading to thesprawling air base, were quiet and empty.   ``I promise you that we will learn from events, and we willensure that such a tragedy is never repeated,'' the U.S. ambassadorto West Germany, Richard Burt, told mourners in this southwesternGerman town.   Since the accident, many West Germans have criticized the UnitedStates for allowing dangerous stunt-flying at its annual Ramsteinmilitary air show. West Germany and its NATO allies have sincesuspended military air shows in West Germany.   Burt recalled several examples of bravery and willingness tohelp that followed the world's worst air show disaster.   ``Dozens of off-duty German and American medical personnelrushed to volunteer their services,'' he said. ``Sixty Frenchsoldiers traveled here together to donate blood. Two medics,themselves bleeding victims of the crash, their clothes burned offtheir backs, worked together to rescue others even more severelyinjured.''   Eyewitnesses earlier spoke of a U.S. helicopter crew thattouched down virtually in the middle of the inferno.   Bernhard Vogel, governor of the West German state where Ramsteinis located, told the mourners: ``Ramstein must not becomesynonymous with catastrophe.''   The Rev. Helmut Pflanz, the local Roman Catholic priest, openedthe service and said: ``Pain and sorrow are tearing at the heartsof so many people. We are praying for the dead and injured of thetragedy, especially for the children.'' The church, on the mainstreet of this town of 7,000 people, is named after the patronsaint of children.   Two of the dead were Americans _ a U.S. Army private and her9-year-old son.   Rhineland-Palatinate state government spokesman Juergen Dietzensaid about 20 of the hospitalized are suffering fromlife-threatening burns.   Pope John Paul II sent a telegram expressing ``deep sympathy forthe relatives of the victims,'' Bishop Anton Schlembach of nearbySpeyer announced.   Among those gathered outside the church to follow the service bylouspeaker was Ramstein Sgt. Paulo DaSilva of Pawtucket, R.I.   ``Some people on the base don't want to talk about it because ofthe horror they saw,'' the 27-year-old airman said.   ``People who came very close to the crash site are havingtrouble expressing their shock,'' DaSilva said. ``It was hell.Period.''   About 15 protesters from a local peace group held up smallbanners calling for a ``return to life'' and a banning of ``weaponsof mass destruction.''   ``We kept warning of the dangers of the air show,'' said groupleader Pastor Angelika Keller. ``We kept asking for a cancellationof the show. But our warnings were not heeded.''</TEXT></DOC>
