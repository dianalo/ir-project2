The decision, against William Mathis, an Atlanta salesrepresentative for the New York-based brokerage house, stemsfrom alleged trading on insider information in the takeoverbids by LTV for Grumman Corp., Anheuser-Busch Cos. forCampbell Taggert Inc., and Allied Corp. for Bendix Corp.</LP><TEXT>   The SEC said that Mr. Thayer, who was on the boards ofAnheuser-Busch and Allied, passed inside information to BillyBob Harris, a former A.G. Edwards andamp; Co. broker who, in turn,tipped Mr. Mathis. In 1985, Messrs. Thayer and Harris pleadedguilty to criminal charges of obstructing justice and lyingto the SEC during the investigation. They each receivedfour-year prison terms and later were forced to disgorgeprofits.   Mr. Mathis, the former captain of the New York Jets teamthat won the Super Bowl in 1969, agreed to an SEC injunctionin 1988 the day before he was to be tried for his role in thescheme. Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, he agreed toa settlement prohibiting him from violating securities lawsin the future.   The SEC then attempted to sanction Mr. Mathis partlybecause the agency said he netted more than $750,000 from thetransactions. But Mr. Mathis argued that he couldn't besanctioned in a way that would deprive him of his livelihoodwithout a separate finding by the agency that he violatedsecurities laws. Since he hadn't admitted any wrongdoing inthe consent injunction, he argued that SEC was oversteppingits authority.   Mr. Mathis's lawyer said his client considers the two-yearsuspension &quot;absolutely unjustified.&quot; Mahlon Frankhauser, thelawyer, said his client was being penalized &quot;merely becausehe agreed to the entry of an injunction without admitting ordenying any violations.&quot; Mr. Frankhauser said Mr. Mathisprobably wouldn't appeal the decision because &quot;he has beenboth financially and psychologically exhausted by the staffof the Securities and Exchange Commission.&quot;   An administrative law judge, Brenda Murray, rejected Mr.Mathis's arguments, siding with the SEC that it was in thepublic interest to bar him from the securities business. Theadministrative law judge agreed with the agency that Mr.Mathis lied to the SEC and to the New York Stock Exchange intheir investigations about the trading.   For example, Mr. Mathis told the SEC that he borrowedmoney from Mr. Harris's father to buy Grumman shares and thatMr. Harris recommended that Mr. Mathis buy Grumman stock, theadministrative law judge said. But in earlier SEC testimony,Mr. Mathis had told the agency that he never discussedGrumman with Mr. Harris, she added.   &quot;Mr. Mathis's reasons for lying or misleadinginvestigating authorities . . . do not in any way excuse ormitigate his actions,&quot; the administrative law judge said.&quot;The evidence is that his actions were deliberate.&quot;   Bear Stearns Chairman Alan Greenberg said, &quot;This issomething that happened in 1982, and I feel bad about thewhole thing. I certainly like Bill Mathis.&quot; A spokeswoman forthe firm said Mr. Mathis, who has been employed there since1970, would be leaving within 15 days.   Mr. Mathis can apply to be reinstated to the securitiesindustry in two years.</TEXT></DOC>
