Greenpeace member Ingrid Jutting told The Associated Press thewaste from the Kemira Oy company is killing fish in the Gulf ofBothnia on Finland's southwestern coast.   ``We don't deny that we are dumping 50,000 tons of ferroussulfate and other heavy metals and impurities into the sea,'' saidcompany spokesman Kalevi Tiihonen. He said the level was withinlegal limits and would be reduced in the next four years.   The Vuorikemia plant on the island of Reposaari produces 84,000tons of titanium dioxide a year for use in paint, paper, plasticand cosmetics. ``The problem is that with every ton of titaniumdioxide, over eight tons of sulfur dioxide waste is produced, whichKemira dumps into the sea,'' Ms. Jutting said.   ``Fishermen have reported that as much as 80 percent of theircatch has to be thrown away,'' said Ms. Jutting. ``The fish,herring in particular, are often dead, deformed or too small toeat.''</TEXT></DOC>
