In the past, the Japanese central bank tried cutting Japanese interest rates to stem the U.S. currency's decline. But rates are now at a post-World War II low, and monetary authorities fear any further reductions could ignite inflation.    As a result, they are abandoning the interest-rate option and are relying on direct intervention in the currency markets to prop up the dollar. But as the declines of the past few days suggest, even aggressive intervention has failed to halt a trend that many market participants regard as unstoppable. Indeed, the Japanese seem to accept that they can only slow, not end, the dollar's slide. While their recent purchases averaging hundreds of millions of dollars a day have dwarfed efforts made by the U.S. and Europe, their intervention has generally fallen short of operations totaling more than $1 billion a day last spring.    &quot;I don't think the dollar is stopping here,&quot; says Yukuo Takahashi, a vice president at Chemical Bank's office in Tokyo. &quot;The exchange rates are moving in the direction they should.&quot;    In Tokyo trading yesterday, the dollar stood at 132.42 yen, down fractionally from Monday. But fairly heavy joint intervention by several European banks later in the day, combined with the prospect of a cut in the West German discount rate, pushed the dollar up in European and U.S. trading. It stood at 133.38 yen late in New York.    The Japanese are clearly at the forefront of the currency battle. Some remarks by senior U.S. officials have been interpreted as talking the dollar down as a means of reducing the U.S. trade deficit. In the absence of a more forceful international effort, about the best the Japanese authorities can do is manage the decline, and hope it occurs gradually rather than quickly.    &quot;A drastic appreciation isn't acceptable. But the Bank of Japan thinks a gradual appreciation of the yen is acceptable to the Japanese economy because it has a favorable impact on inflationary expectations,&quot; says Nobuyuki Ueda, a senior economist at Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.    Japan is in fairly good shape to absorb another round of dollar depreciation. Although the strong yen hurts Japan's export-related industries by making their goods more expensive in the U.S., such big companies as Honda Motor Co. and the Hitachi and Matsushita groups have cut costs, built more facilities overseas and generally weathered the so-called yen shock. Economists predict that the Japanese economy will grow between 3% and 3.5% in the fiscal year ending March 31.    It was the rebound from the yen shock -- the currency's rise of about 70% against the dollar since autumn 1985 -- that had persuaded Bank of Japan officials in early October to try raising interest rates a bit, largely to calm a wild escalation in land prices. A firming dollar also gave the authorities maneuvering room.    Then came the world-wide stock-market crash that began in the U.S. on Oct. 19, and all bets were off. &quot;We were on the phone all night,&quot; says one senior Bank of Japan official. The central bank injected huge amounts of cash into the financial system to avoid a further stock-market plunge, and share prices recovered, more in Tokyo than in New York or London.    But though the crash snuffed out any chance the Bank of Japan would increase the discount rate -- its base fee on loans to financial institutions, which is still at a post-war low of 2.5% -- there isn't much likelihood it will cut rates, either. Officials are worried that the money supply, which grew 11.1% in September from a year earlier, is already running too high.    (Cutting the rate would tend to bolster the dollar by widening the spread between U.S. and Japanese interest rates. This would encourage Japanese investors to seek higher-yielding American investments, creating demand for dollars.)    Analysts in the U.S. say the Reagan administration has stopped pressuring Japan to lower interest rates as a way of stimulating its economy. As a result, when finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrial nations confer at a meeting expected within a few weeks, Japan may escape serious criticism for its handling of either monetary or fiscal policy.    &quot;The Japanese could argue they've done everything they can,&quot; says Christopher Mitchinson, director of research for Salomon Brothers in London.    During the three days starting Nov. 9, when the dollar tested the 134-yen level, the Bank of Japan reportedly bought billions of dollars to support the sinking U.S. currency. &quot;Once they decide to do something, they keep coming back again and again. They are persistent,&quot; says a Western observer. Bank of Japan officials maintain that all the major central banks intervened to prevent a dollar free fall. But at times Japan seemed to be the only country making a genuine effort. So, while some U.S. officials were reportedly talking the dollar down, the Japanese started talking it up.    &quot;America is the No. 1 country in the world. And the No. 1 country should have a strong currency,&quot; says Akira Nambara, director of the research and statistics department at the Bank of Japan. &quot;To rely on exchange rates {to correct the trade imbalance} is like relying on a drug to ease the pain.&quot;    Perhaps the main reason the Bank of Japan is willing to let the dollar drift lower is that the stock-price collapse and the dollar decline itself have relieved inflationary pressures. There is some evidence land prices have peaked, and the costs of commodities such as crude oil and lumber are declining as the yen now buys more abroad. &quot;The stock-market crash may have been a blessing in disguise,&quot; says Mr. Nambara. And Mr. Ueda of Long-Term Credit Bank says the yen's gradual appreciation &quot;is a useful tool to block inflation from the outside.&quot;    For all the Bank of Japan's intentions to manage a gradual adjustment in exchange rates, some economists say stability depends on the U.S., not Japan. Hirohiko Okumura, chief economist at the Nomura Research Institute, argues that a growing U.S. economy will continue to suck in imports, if not from Japan, then from countries such as Taiwan and South Korea, and the U.S. trade imbalance will continue to drive down the dollar. &quot;Unless the U.S. abandons its policy of high economic growth, Japan's policy changes will be meaningless,&quot; says Mr. Okumura.    Nevertheless, the markets will keep testing the Bank of Japan's resolve, and its ability, to prevent a dollar crash. Some economists predict that the next crucial psychological level -- 130 yen to the dollar -- isn't far off. </TEXT></DOC>
