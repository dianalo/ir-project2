The estimated weighted-average margins are shown in the ``Suspensionof Liquidation'' section of this notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">Case History </ITAG>Since the Notice of Initiation on January 24, 1989 (54 PR 3517), the followingevents have occurred. On February 13, 1989, the ITC determined that thereis a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States is threatenedwith material injury by reason of imports from Korea of SBTS (USITC Pub.No. 2156, February 1989). On February 9, 1989, the Department's questionnaire was presented to GoldstarTelecommunications Co., Ltd. (Goldstar) and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd(Samsung). These two manufacturers accounted for a substantial portionof exports of the subject merchandise to the United States during the periodof investigation (POI). On April 13, 1989, petitioner requested that the preliminary determinationbe postponed. On April 27, 1989, in accordance with section 733(c)(1)(A)of the Act, we postponed the preliminary determination until July 26, 1989(54 FR 19211). On March 3 and May 15, 1989 we received replies to the questionnaire fromGoldstar and Samsung. A number of supplemental and deficiency questionnaires were issued subsequentto May 15, 1989. Supplemental and deficiency responses were received fromthe respondents prior to the date of this preliminary determination. <ITAG tagnum="84">Period of Investigation </ITAG>The POI is July 1, 1988, through December 31, 1988. <ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigation </ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of Customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the United States fully converted to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule(HTS), as provided for in section 1201 <T3>et seq.</T3> of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988.All merchandise entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption onor after this date is now classified solely according to the appropriateHTS item numbers. The HTS numbers are provided for convenience and U.S.Customs Service purposes. The written description remains dispositive.The products covered by this investigation are certain small business telephonesystems and subassemblies thereof, currently classifiable under <T3>Harmonized Tariff Schedule</T3> item numbers 8517.30.2000, 8517.30.2500,8517.30.3000, 8517.10.0020, 8517.10.0040, 8517.10.0050, 8517.00.0070, 8517.10.0080,8517.90.1000, 8517.90.1500, 8517.90.3000, 8518.30.1000, 8504.40.0004, 8504.40.0008,8504.40.0010, 8517.81.0010, 8517.81.0020, 8517.90.4000, and 8504.40.0015.Prior to January 1, 1989, such merchandise was classifiable under items684.5710, 684.5720, 684.5730, 684.5805, 684.5810, 684.5815, 684.5825, 684.5830,682.6051, and 682.6053 of the <T3>Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated</T3> (TSUSA). Certain small business telephone systems and subassemblies thereof aretelephone systems, whether complete or incomplete, assembled or unassembled,with intercom or internal calling capability and total non-blocking portcapacities of between 2 and 256 ports, and discrete subassemblies designedfor use in such systems. A subassembly is ``designed'' for use in a smallbusiness telephone system if it functions to its full capability only whenoperated as part of a small business telephone system. These subassembliesare defined as follows: (1) Telephone sets and consoles, consisting of proprietary, corded telephonesets or consoles. A console has the ability to perform certain functionsincluding: answer all lines in the system; monitor the status of otherphone sets; and transfer calls. The term ``telephone sets and consoles''is defined to include any combination of two or more of the following items,when imported or shipped in the same container, with or without additionalapparatus: housing; hand set; cord (line or hand set); power supply; telephoneset circuit cards; console circuit cards. (2) Control and switching equipment, whether denominated as a key serviceunit, control unit, or cabinet/switch. ``Control and switching equipment''is defined to include the units described in the preceding sentence whichconsist of one or more circuit cards or modules (including backplane circuitcards) and one or more of the following items, when imported or shippedin the same container as the circuit cards or modules, with or withoutadditional apparatus: connectors to accept circuit cards or modules; buildingwiring. (3) Circuit cards and modules, including power supplies. These may be incorporatedinto control and switching equipment or telephone sets and consoles, orthey may be imported or shipped separately. A power converts or dividesinput power of not more than 2400 watts into output power of not more than1800 watts supplying DC power of approximately 5 volts, 24 volts, and 48volts, as well as 90 volt AC ringing capability. The following merchandise has been excluded from this investigation: (1)nonproprietary industry-standard (``tip/ring'') telephone sets and othersubassemblies that are not specifically designed for use in a covered system,even though a system may be adapted to use such nonproprietary equipmentto provide some system functions; (2) telephone answering machines or facsimilemachines integrated with telephone sets; and (3) adjunct software usedon external data processing equipment. We note that a number of ambiguities existed in the scope language previouslypublished in the Notice of Initiation with regard to the definition ofsubassemblies. We therefore have clarified the language describing thesubassemblies under investigation. In addition, the Department has received a number of inquiries regardingthe inclusion of dual use subassemblies within the scope of this investigation.The Department defines dual use subassemblies as those subassemblies thatfunction to their full capability when operated as part of a large businesstelephone system as well as a small system. Because dual use subassembliesby definition are not subassemblies ``designed'' for use in small businesstelephone systems, dual use subassemblies are excluded from the scope ofthe investigation. <ITAG tagnum="84">Such or Similar Comparisons </ITAG>For all respondent companies, pursuant to section 771(16)(C) of the Act,we established four categories of ``such or similar'' merchandise consistingof: a) control and switching equipment, b) circuit cards and modules, c)telephone sets and consoles, and d) complete small business telephone systems.Product comparisons were made on the basis of the following criteria whichare ranked in the order of importance. For control and switching equipmentwe used the following criteria: 1) port capacity based on minimum operationalconfiguration, 2) type of central microprocessor, and 3) read-only memory(ROM) size. For circuit card and modules we considered: 1) functions, and2) physical appearance. For telephone sets and consoles we considered:1) number of buttons (regardless of function) excluding dialpad, and 2)number of individual visual indicators. For complete telephone systems,we made comparisons on the basis of the similarity of the subassemblies,using the criteria described in the preceding sentences. Where there were no sales of identical merchandise in the home or thirdcountry markets with which to compare merchandise sold in the United States,sales of the most similar merchandise were compared on the basis of thecharacteristics described above. We made adjustments for differences inthe physical characteristics of the merchandise in accordance with section773(a)(4)(C) of the Act. Consistent with our normal practice, when adjustmentsproved to be substantial, we used constructed value. In this case, we determinedthat an adjustment greater than twenty percent of the cost of manufacturingof the U.S. model is substantial. In order to determine whether there were sufficient sales of SBTS in thehome market to serve as the basis for calculating foreign market value(FMV), we compared the volume of home market sales within each such orsimilar category to the volume of third country sales within each respectivesuch or similar category, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act.Samsung had no sales of complete small business telephone systems in theUnited States during the POI. We determined that there were sufficienthome market sales to unrelated customers for each of the other such orsimilar categories. For Goldstar we determined that there were sufficient home market salesto unrelated customers for two such or similar categories: telephone setsand consoles; and control and switching equipment. For two such or similarcategories, circuit cards and modules, and complete telephone systems,we determined that there were insufficient home market sales. With respect to circuit cards and modules, we determined that sales tothe Philippines, Cyprus, Canada, Italy, and Norway were the most appropriatebasis for calculating FMV because the merchandise sold in these countrieswas the most comparable to that sold in the United States. With respectto complete small business telephone systems, Goldstar made no sales tothird country markets during the POI. Therefore, we are comparing UnitedStates sales to constructed value for this such or similar category. <ITAG tagnum="84">Fair Value Comparisons </ITAG>To determine whether sales of SBTS from Korea to the United States weremade at less than fair value, we compared the United States price to theforeign market value, as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``ForeignMarket Value'' sections of this notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">United States Price </ITAG>For Samsung, we based the United States price on purchase price in accordancewith section 772(b) of the Act because all sales were made directly tounrelated parties to importation into the United States. For Goldstar,we based the United States price on exporter's sales price, in accordancewith section 772(c) of the Act, because in each case the sale to the firstunrelated purchaser took place after importation into the United States.We were unable to make comparisons for sales where further manufacturingwas claimed because sufficient data which complied with the Department'srequests for information was not submitted in time for consideration inour preliminary determination. <ITAG tagnum="84">Samsung </ITAG>For Samsung, we calculated purchase price based on packed f.o.b. Koreanport prices. We made deductions, where appropriate, for inland freight,wharfage and container freight station fees, customs clearance fees, andpostage fees. We added rebated duties and uncollected taxes pursuant tosection 772(d)(1) (B) and (C) of the Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">Goldstar </ITAG>We calculated exporter's sales price based on packed, delivered pricesin the United States. We made deductions from ESP, where appropriate, forcash discounts, brokerage, warfage, inland freight in Korea, stuffing charges,ocean freight, marine insurance, United States customs duty, customs brokeragefees, inland freight in the United States, inland insurance, rebates, warrantyexpenses, credit expenses, promotional material, cooperative advertising,commissions, and indirect expenses and inventory carrying expenses incurredin both Korea and the United States. We added uncollected duties, and uncollectedor rebated taxes pursuant to section 772(d)(1) (B) and (C) of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Foreign Market Value </ITAG>In accordance with section 773(a) of the Act, we calculated FMV based onhome market sales, third country sales, or constructed value, as appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="84">Samsung</ITAG>For Samsung, we calculated foreign market value based on the packed, deliveredprices to unrelated customers in the home market. We made deductions, where appropriate, for inland freight, inland insurance,rebates, and discounts. We deducted the home market packing costs fromthe foreign market value and added U.S. packing costs. We made circumstanceof sale adjustments, where appropriate, for differences in credit terms,warranty expenses, and advertising expenses, pursuant to section 773(4)(B)of the Act. We did not consider technical services to be a direct sellingexpense for purposes of this preliminary determination because it was notclear that this expense was directly related to sales of the subject merchandise.We will look at this expense in more detail at verification. We made an upward adjustment to tax-exclusive home market prices for thevalue-added tax we computed for the United States price.Where appropriate, we made further adjustments to the home market priceto account for differences in the physical characteristics of the merchandise,in accordance with section 353.57 of the Department's regulations publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on March 28, 1989 (54 FR 12742) (to be codifiedat 19 CFR section 353.57). For those products sold in the United States for which the difference inmerchandise adjustment between the reported home market product and theU.S. product was substantial, we calculated foreign market value basedon constructed value (CV), in accordance with section 773(e) of the Act.In this case, we determined that an adjustment greater than twenty percentis substantial. The calculation of constructed value is fully describedin the ``Constructed Value'' section of this notice. We used best information available for two U.S. products of circuit cards,for which both the difference in merchandise adjustment was greater thantwenty percent and no constructed value was supplied on the computer tape.As best information available, we took the highest margin for Samsung containedin the petition for circuit cards and modules. <ITAG tagnum="84">Goldstar </ITAG>Where sales in the home market were used, we calculated foreign marketvalue based on the packed, delivered or ex-works prices to unrelated customers.We made deductions, where appropriate, for inland freight, cash discounts,volume rebates, product rebates and exchange rebates. We deducted the homemarket packing costs from the foreign market value and added all U.S. packingcosts. We made deductions, where appropriate, for differences in creditterms and advertising. We also deducted home market indirect selling expenses,including: warranty expenses, inventory carrying costs, and other indirectselling expenses. These expenses were capped by the amount of indirectselling expenses incurred in the U.S. market, in accordance with andSection;353.41 of the Department's regulations. We made an upward adjustment to tax-exclusive home market prices for thevalue-added tax we computed for the United States price. Where appropriate, we made further adjustments to the home market priceto account for differences in the physical characteristics of the merchandise,in accordance with andSection; 353.57 of the Department's regulations. We calculated foreign market value, in the third country markets, basedon the packed, delivered or ex-works prices to unrelated customers. Wemade deductions, where appropriate, for wharfage, ocean freight, inlandfreight in the third countries, brokerage, stuffing and marine insurance.We deducted the home market packing costs from the foreign market valueand added all U.S. packing costs. We made deductions, where appropriate,for differences in credit terms and commissions. We added duty rebatesto the third country price. We also deducted third country indirect sellingexpenses, including: inventory carrying costs and other indirect sellingexpenses. These expenses were capped by the amount of indirect sellingexpenses incurred on sales in the U.S. market, in accordance with andSection;353.41 of the Department's regulations. Where appropriate, we made further adjustments to the third country priceto account for differences in the physical characteristics of the merchandise,in accordance with section 353.57 of the Department's regulations. For those products sold in the United States for which the difference inmerchandise adjustment between the reported home market or third countryproduct and the U.S. product was substantial, we calculated foreign marketvalue based on constructed value in accordance with section 773(e) of theAct. In this case, we determined that an adjustment greater than twentypercent is substantial. <ITAG tagnum="84">Constructed Value </ITAG>In the situations described above, we calculated foreign market value basedon constructed value for Samsung and Goldstar, in accordance with section773(e) of the Act. The constructed value included amounts for materials,fabrication costs, general expenses, profit and packing. The statutoryminimum of eight percent profit was applied in the case of Samsung. ForGoldstar, the actual profit rate submitted by the respondent was used sinceit exceeded the eight percent statutory minimum. In all cases the amountsfor actual general expenses were used since these figures exceeded thestatutory minimum of ten percent of the cost of materials and fabrication.Reported finance expenses were reduced to account for the interest portionincluded in the imputed credit and finished goods inventory carrying costs.In general, the information submitted by respondents was relied upon incalculating constructed value, except in those instances where the costswere not appropriately quantified or valued. For Samsung, we adjusted severalcosts which were not appropriately quantified or valued. First, the Departmentused Samsung's corporate general and administrative (Gandamp;A) and financeexpenses, as a percentage of the cost of sales, to develop a ratio in calculatingthe Gandamp;A and finance expenses for the subject merchandise. Samsung hadreported these expenses using a ratio based primarily on the divisionalGandamp;A and finance expenses, instead of the corporate Gandamp;A and financeexpenses. Also the constructed value information reported by Samsung didnot contain gains and losses on the disposal of fixed assets, researchand development (Randamp;D) amortization expenses, special depreciation,miscellaneous and other losses incurred. Amounts for these losses weretherefore allocated to the subject merchandise as non-specific operatingexpenses in the computed general expenses. We made circumstance of saleadjustments for credit, warranty, and advertising expenses.For Goldstar, we adjusted the costs which were not appropriately quantifiedor valued as follows. The Gandamp;A and finance expenses of consolidatedGoldstar Telecommunications as a percentage of the cost of sales for consolidatedGoldstar Telecommunications were used by the Department to develop thefactor used in calculating the Gandamp;A and finance expenses for the subjectmerchandise. Goldstar had used a ratio based on divisional Gandamp;A andfinance expenses instead of corporate-wide Gandamp;A and finance expenses.We also made deductions from constructed value for home market sellingexpenses consisting of credit and advertising. We made an adjustment toconstructed value for home market indirect selling expenses consistingof warranty expenses, inventory carrying costs, and other indirect sellingexpenses. These expenses were capped by the amount of indirect sellingexpenses incurred on sales in the U.S. market, in accordance with andSection;353.41 of the Department's regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Currency Conversion</ITAG>We used the official exchange rates in effect on the dates of sale, inaccordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act, as amended by section 615of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984. All currency conversions were madeat the rates certified by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in accordancewith andSection; 353.60 of the Department's regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Verification</ITAG>As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify all informationused in reaching the final determination in this investigation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Suspension of Liquidation</ITAG>In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the U.S.Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all entries of SBTS from Korea,as defined in the ``Scope of Investigation'' section of this notice, thatare entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after thedate of publication of this notice in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>The U.S. Customs Service shall require a cashdeposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated amounts by which theforeign market value of the subject merchandise from Korea exceeds theUnited States price as shown below. This suspension of liquidation willremain in effect until further notice.
