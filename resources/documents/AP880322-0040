MILLER</NOTE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriegahas offered to resign before next year's presidential elections ifopponents agree to talks with his regime, Panama's chief of statetold his countrymen Monday.   The opposition, whose general strike Monday paralyzed thenation, and the United States, which has kept up steady pressure toforce a Noriega resignation, immediately rejected the general'soffer.   Elections are scheduled for May 1989.   ``There will be no dialogue,'' said Aurelio Barria, the mainleader of the National Civic Crusade, an anti-Noriega coalition of200 business, professional, labor and political groups that calledthe indefinite work stoppage.   He added: ``The general has to go _ immediately, not eventually.The strike will continue.''   Manuel Solis Palma, installed last month as the minister incharge of the presidency, made the announcement of Noriega's offerin a nationally broadcast speech.   He said Noriega had given his word ``as an officer and agentleman'' to step down if his conditions are met.   In Washington, State Department spokesman Anita Stockman said:   ``We believe the offer is little more than one, a ploy toattempt to legitimize the illegal Solis Palma regime by calling fornegotiations between it and opposition groups and two, an effort onthe part of Noriega to maintain direct or indirect control of thePanamanian Defense Forces.   ``We stand by our previous view that Noriega should go, and thesooner the better for Panama.''   Noriega is under indictment on federal drug charges in Florida.The United States has dried up the flow of money to Panama, whichuses the U.S. dollar as its currency, in the effort to force himout, and the economy is near collapse.   The general put down a coup attempt by dissident officers lastweek and rejected a U.S. plan for him to leave Panama and live inSpain.   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater saidearlier Monday that there were no plans for further talks withNoriega after the return of two administration officials fromPanama City.   ``I think they have a pretty good reading of the general'sattitude,'' Fitzwater said. ``It didn't seem to include furtherconversations, at least at this point.''   The strike included Panama City's central commercial district,where the small shops that cater to the lower and middle classeshad not joined previous shutdowns by wealthier businesmen andindustrialists.   ``We're sending Noriega a message,'' said the owner of a shoestore, who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisals. ``Wehope he's listening.''   Noriega commands the military and police as head of the15,000-member Defense Forces and is the power behind the civiliangovernment.   The secretary of the Panamanian Human Rights Foundation said aman died Monday of wounds suffered when he was hit in the face andchest by birdshot fired by police during disturbances in PanamaCity last Wednesday. It was the fourth protest-related death sinceanti-government demonstrations began last summer.   Noriega's opponents hailed the strike as their greatest triumphso far.   ``It's completely successful,'' said Guillermo Cochez, vicepresident of the Christian Democratic Party. ``Today has been avery special day ... in the capital as well as the provinces. Wehope Noriega's advisers and the people surrounding him will helphim to see the reality.''   ``The paralyzation is total in industry, finance and commerce,''said Carlos Gonzalez de la Lastra, a business leader.   Gonzalez and Cochez are directors, along with Barria, of theNational Civic Crusade.   Noriega made another move Monday to strengthen his control ofthe Defense Forces by announcing the promotions of 98 officers toranks ranging from colonel to lieutenant.   Among those promoted to colonel was Eros Ramiro Cal, who wasnamed last week to replace Col. Leonidas Macias, the leader of thefoiled coup, as the nation's police chief.   The Defense Forces also said administrative discipline would betaken against 17 officers implicated in last Wednesday's attemptedcoup, but did not give details. It previously acknowledged eight ornine officers had joined in the attempt and said only five werebeing detained.   Gustavo Gonzalez of the striking dockworkers said leaders of allmajor unions were summoned to a meeting Sunday night with SolisPalma, and told the military would not interfere if the strikeremained peaceful.   He said union leaders were told the government, which could notmeet its payroll two weeks ago, also would be unable to coversemi-monthly paychecks due next week.   Solis Palma replaced Eric Arturo Delvalle, who was dismissed bythe legislature after he tried to fire Noriega and still isrecognized by the United States as Panama's president. Delvalle isin hiding in Panama.   Because the government has silenced opposition newspapers andbroadcast stations, thousands of people went to work withoutknowing a strike had been called. Most went home when they foundstores and offices closed.   By midday, the city was a ghost town patrolled by helmetedsoldiers in combat gear. The government said they were providingsecurity for businesses that chose to open.   Panama's ailing economy came apart after Feb. 25, when Delvalletried to fire Noriega and the legislature fired Delvalle.   Banks closed the following week and the government could notmeet a $33 million payroll for 130,000 public employees.   Washington has cut off economic and military aid and millions ofdollars in Panamanian funds have been frozen in U.S. banks by legalactions.</TEXT></DOC>
