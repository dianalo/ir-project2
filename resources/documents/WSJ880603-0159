The recommendations are in a draft report that will probably be adopted by the Presidential Commission on the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Epidemic, said the panel's chairman, retired Adm. James Watkins. The commission plans to send the report to Mr. Reagan in three weeks and vote on the recommendations the week before.    Mr. Watkins said that discrimination is &quot;the foremost obstacle to progress&quot; in the fight against acquired immune deficiency syndrome, which is transmitted through sexual relations and contaminated needles.    &quot;People simply will not come forward to be tested, or will not supply names of sexual contacts for notification, if they feel they will lose their jobs and homes&quot; because of a positive AIDS-related test.    An executive order, the draft report said, would be a &quot;critical first step towards passage and enforcement&quot; of federal legislation to provide long-term, comprehensive anti-discrimination protection.    The Reagan administration opposes new legislation for the time being. Last fall, Health and Human Services Secretary Otis Bowen told Congress that the HHS doesn't rule out the possibility of federal legislation, but prefers to support state efforts. White House officials had no comment on the report yesterday.    Mr. Watkins also called on the Justice Department to withdraw its 1986 opinion that discrimination based on the fear of AIDS is not covered by the federal law prohibiting bias against the handicapped. That position was rejected by a 1987 Supreme Court decision. The lack of a Justice Department statement after the decision &quot;has created confusion and uncertainty&quot; about its position, which could be clarified with a statement supporting the court's stance.    The Justice Department press office had no comment yesterday.    The 269-page report covers a range of AIDS-related issues, including health care, research and education, which were detailed earlier in a preliminary commission report. Mr. Watkins said his recommendations would cost about $3 billion a year more than current expenditures.    But many of the 579 suggestions outlined in the current report deal more with policy than money. Mr. Watkins, for example, called for establishing a public health emergency-response system that could quickly attack crises such as the AIDS problem. &quot;The leadership of the federal government in responding to the (AIDS) epidemic has been inconsistent and not properly coordinated,&quot; he complained in the report.    To correct that and prevent similar failures in the future, Mr. Watkins said the surgeon general should have increased powers to direct the government's response to public health emergencies. The surgeon general should report directly to the president on those matters and coordinate the work of various agencies.    When an emergency occurs, the surgeon general should be able to prepare budget requests without clearance from the White House Office of Management and Budget, and the hiring procedures of the Office of Personnel Management should be waived when additional workers are needed quickly to staff the health emergency activities. </TEXT></DOC>
