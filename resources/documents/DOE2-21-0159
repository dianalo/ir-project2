Thispaper will concentrate on the thermal-hydraulic behavior of a hydrogen-cooledsmall particle bed reactor (PBR). The PBR core modeled here consistsof a hexagonal array of fuel elements embedded in a moderator matrix.The fuel elements are annular packed beds of fuel particles held betweentwo porous cylindrical frits. These particles, 500 to 600 {mu}m in diameter,have a uranium carbide core, which is coated by two layers of graphiteand an outer coating of zirconium carbide. Coolant flows, radially inward,from the cold frit through the packed bed and hot frit and axially outthe channel, formed by the hot frit to a common plenum. A fast runningone-dimensional lumped-parameter steady-state code (FTHP) was developedto evaluate the effects of design changes in fuel assembly and powerdistribution. Another objective for the code was to investigate variousmethods of coolant control to minimize hot channel effects and maximizeoutlet temperatures.</TEXT></DOC>
