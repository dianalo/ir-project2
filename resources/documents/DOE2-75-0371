<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-75-0371 </DOCNO><TEXT>Recent qualitative studies of the effects of toxicants on populationshave resulted in conjectures about the role played by a dose-responsefunction in determining the existence of multiple equilibrium states,consequences of modeling chemical dynamics by first-order laws, and problemsarising when uptake or toxicant can occur through both environmentaland food chain pathways. A brief synthesis, focusing on the sensitivityof the models to the representation of the population, of these studiesis presented. Then, some new persistence-extinction results for resource-consumer-toxicantinteractions are indicated. An analytical approach is used to addressa set of generic models each employing a dynamic submodel of the population,a dynamic formulation for environmental concentration of a toxicant,and a dynamic concentration of toxicant in the individual organisms.Conclusions, derived from the models by analytic techniques, are phrasedin terms of system-level parameters that govern persistence or extinctionof the model population.</TEXT></DOC>
