The Saudi government said it will punish anyone involved in a violation of security, including possession of weapons or explosives, and &quot;any act of disturbance, terrorism or sabotage such as demonstrations, slogan-shouting and carrying of posters and banners, use of loudspeakers and blocking of roads and delaying of pilgrims from performing the rites,&quot; the news agency said.    The statement, issued Tuesday, was clearly aimed at the Shiite Moslem followers of Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who are among the millions of pilgrims to visit Mecca.    The annual hajj, or pilgrimage to Mecca, begins in late July.    At last year's pilgrimage, more than 400 people, mostly Iranian Shiites, were killed in riots. Iran accused Saudi security forces of opening fire on its people.    The Saudis accused the Iranians of holding demonstrations, including anti-U.S. protests, in defiance of a ban on political activity. In April, Saudi Arabia broke off diplomatic relations with Tehran, citing terrorism and subversion.    The law in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia is based on the Koran and its Islamic code, which allows beheading and crucifixion. Crucifixion has not been used in years in Saudi Arabia. Other punishments include the cutting off of hands or feet.    The Saudis said their warning of Koranic punishment was triggered by reports from Tehran &quot;of threats from Khomeini and his aides to plant some hired agents of different nationalities to conduct acts of sabotage, including hooliganism and atheistic chantings and other foolish practices . . . carried out by the Revolutionary Guards last year.&quot;    Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Cyprus, said today that &quot;the Saudi regime fears a truly Islamic hajj and holding of demonstrations. It has created obstacles for Moslems.&quot;    The Saudis have asked Iran to limit the number of its pilgrims this year to 45,000 instead of the previous 150,000.    Iranian leaders have said they will boycott this year's hajj, but have called on Shiite Moslems from other countries to stage protests.    Iran's 44 million people are predominantly Shiite Moslem, while most of Saudi Arabia's 11 million people belong to the predominant Sunni sect of Islam. Saudi Arabia said that Iranian Revolutionary Guards posing as pilgrims tried in 1986 to smuggle explosives hidden in suitcases into Saudi Arabia to carry out sabotage. </TEXT></DOC>
