After two hours offrustration, the Sandinistas decided to call it a night.   The scene was not a remote Nicaraguan battlefield but anon-descript office building a few blocks from the White Housewhere Sandinista and Contra negotiators had spent seven days tryingto work out a cease-fire.   On the night in question, the Contras took a recess from thetalks and caucused among themselves, leaving the Sandinistadelegation in the dark as to their whereabouts. Two hours passed.There was no sign of the Contras.   ``We don't know where they are,'' the chief Sandinistasnegotiator, Victor Hugo Tinoco, told reporters after deciding hehad waited long enough. ``This building is rather large.'' He left.   The episode seemed to crystallize the inability of the two sidesto achieve harmony even on relatively simple issues. This pastTuesday, the talks were suspended indefinitely, both sides agreeingtheir efforts were going nowhere.   The pattern resembles what has been happening in other regionalconflicts: Angola, Afghanistan and Cambodia.   In each instance, the U.S.-Soviet dimension of the conflict hasdiminished but long years of accumulated mistrust among localrivals are impeding negotiated settlements. Accordingly, thewarfare continues, albeit at differing levels of intensity.   In Nicaragua, the United States suspended military aid to theContra rebels almost two years ago. The fighting continues witheach side accusing the other of being the obstacle to peace.   Indeed, the collapse of the Nicaraguan cease-fire talks combinedwith the escalated fighting in El Salvador in recent weeks hasraised doubts whether the Central America peace process, which hasboasted a number of highly touted ``peace'' breakthroughs, is stillviable.   A peace settlement in Nicaragua will hinge largely on whetherthe national elections set for February produce a result thatNicaraguans of all political colors can live with _ or at leastaccept as legitimate.   In El Salvador, there is nothing to indicate that the governmentand the rebels have the political will to negotiate theirdifferences.   Angola's experience is somewhat similar to Central America. Justweeks ago, there were hopes for a cease-fire followed by talks onnational reconciliation between the leftist government and theU.S.-backed rebels.   Instead, fighting has escalated recently. U.S. officials believethe more militant factions in the Angolan government leadershiphave the upper hand over those favoring a political settlement.   Meanwhile, the East-West dimension of the 14-year-old conflictin Angola has diminished with the continuing withdrawal of what hadbeen a 50,000-strong Cuban troop presence. All the Cubans are dueto be home by early 1991 but Moscow and Washington are continuingto arm their respective allies.   In Afghanistan, the Soviets completed their withdrawal more thannine months ago. But there is nothing resembling a peace processbetween the warring faction and Soviet and American weaponscontinue to pour in.   In Cambodia, troops from the pro-Soviet government in Vietnamhave left after a 10-year stay but, once again, a politicalsettlement seems beyond reach at the moment.   The incumbent government in Phnom Penh has refused to considerany role in a transition arrangement for the Khmer Rouge because ofthe mass killings they carried out when they ruled Cambodia duringthe latter half of the 1970s.   The Khmer Rouge remain a force to be reckoned because of thelarge and powerful guerrilla army they have developed since theirouster from power.   While the superpower component of all the conflicts has beenreduced, Washington and Moscow are still involved enough in each togive President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev plenty totalk about when they meet next week.</TEXT></DOC>
