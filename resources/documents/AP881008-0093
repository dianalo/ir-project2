Iraqi officials indicated that the 6-week-old peace talks remaindeadlocked.   Velayati, interviewed by the official Islamic Republic NewsAgency as he flew back to Tehran from New York, said negotiatorsfrom both sides agreed that Iran and Iraq would withdraw theirtroops within 15 days to pre-war borders and exchange war prisoners.   Several hours after IRNA reported Velayati's comments, Iraq'sMinister of State for Foreign Affairs, Saddoum Hamadi, declaredthat ``Iraq will not relinquish even one inch of its territory'' toIran.   The official Iraqi News Agency quoted Hamadi as telling ameeting of Iraq's ruling Baath Arab Socialist Party that ``Iraqimposed its will of peace on Iran from a position of strength.''   Both reports were monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus.   Hamadi made no direct reference to Velayati's comments. But asenior Iraqi official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, toldThe Associated Press the peace talks remain blocked.   He said the obstacle was Iran's refusal to agree to Iraq'sdemand that the disputed Shatt Al-Arab waterway, which forms thesouthern boundary between the gulf foes, be cleared for navigationbefore further negotiations can be held.   Both sides have repeatedly accused each other of stalling in theU.N._mediated negotiations that began Aug.25 in Geneva and moved toNew York. The talks began after both sides accepted a U.N. SecurityCouncil resolution calling for a cease-fire.   Iraqi officials have accused the United States and its Europeanallies of softening their hostility toward Iran since the Aug.20cease-fire began because they want a stake in lucrative contractsin Iran's massive postwar reconstruction.   Velayati said that Iran has agreed to drop its ``right to searchships in the Strait of Hormuz,'' the only gateway to the strategicPersian Gulf.   Iran had claimed that until a formal peace treaty was signed, itwas in a state of war with Iraq and had the right to search vesselssailing into the gulf to determine whether they carried war-relatedmaterials for Iraq.   Iraq has disputed this. But apart from one Iraqi vessel that washarrassed immediately after the cease-fire, there have been noreports of any other Iraqi vessels, or ships heading for Iraqiports, being stopped by the Iranians.   Velayati said the talks in New York, under the supervision ofU.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar and his specialrepresentative, Jan Eliasson, were ``more successful'' than twoprevious rounds in Geneva.   He did not say when the reported agreement would take effect.   But IRNA quoted him as questioning whether the Iraqi delegationhad the authority to seal any pact.   He complained that the Iraqis, led by Foreign Minister TariqAziz, ``did not have sufficient authority to make decisions.   ``In order to be successful, the parties involved must have theauthority and the decision-making power. Otherwise, talks will notprogress and will become more complicated,'' Velayati said.   ``The Iraqi delegates feel somewhat confused as to what theyshould do,'' he added.</TEXT></DOC>
