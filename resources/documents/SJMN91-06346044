It also plagues Captain Hook, who oncekept track of the crocodile that swallowed his hand by the noisy alarm clockin its belly. Hook detests clocks even more than those &quot;rampageous&quot; Lost Boys.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SPIELBERG DOESN'T HOOK US WITH HIS OVERGROWN PETERPAN  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Film Review  </MEMO><TEXT>     Ironic, isn't it, that time also is the curse of &quot;Hook,&quot; the new StevenSpielberg epic starring Robin Williams as a grown-up Peter, Dustin Hoffman asthe latest in a long line of dainty but deadly Hooks and, through the miracleof matte photography, Julia Roberts as a considerably less jealous or prankishTinkerbell.;   The $70-million, 87-years-later sequel to the J. M. Barrieperennial &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (adapted by Disney and for a Mary Martin TV special)opens today -- all 2 hours and 20 minutes of it!;   At this length, &quot;Hook&quot; is30 minutes longer than &quot;E.T.,&quot; 50 minutes longer than &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; and90 minutes longer than the average cartoon feature by Disney.;   Tick TockTick Tock.;   According to my trusty digital, it takes Spielberg -- once knownfor his slam-bang openings -- more than half an hour to introduce hischaracters and get them from San Francisco to London, where Hook kidnapsPeter's two children, thus setting the scene for the paunchy, humorless,workaholic Peter to return to Neverland to do battle with his old nemesis andlearn to crow again.;   It takes another hour before Peter -- now known asPeter Banning, unscrupulous lawyer-developer -- begins to recall hismischievous, high-flying past on Neverland. It's another 15 minutes from herebefore the big epiphany and first solo flight as an adult.;   When Peterfinally takes to the air, it's fairly exhilarating and heartening, and shouldbring squeals of delight from the little ones -- provided they're not in theirown peaceful dreamland by this point.;   Tick Tock Tick Tock.;   You can seethe problem here. Spielberg the master fantasist has collided with Spielbergthe maker of Event Films. The result is a big, over-plotted whale of anadventure that often plays like a &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot; treatise on classicfantasy.;   Worse, this blunted &quot;Hook&quot; is claustrophobic and, in the worstsense, theatrical, like that Martin staging of yore. After much exposition,which pounds home the point that the thirtysomething Peter is a self-involvedlouse who's forgotten how to laugh or use his imagination, Spielberg drops usonto a soundstage wharf and pirate ship. On a Broadway stage, such full-sizereproductions would bring oohs and aahs; on screen they feel phony andconfining.;   The Jolly Roger herself is a fun conception, with Captain'squarters as spacious as a deluxe Vegas suite and skull-and-crossbones motifcarried out fore and aft.;   Even more impressive are the matte renderings ofNeverland, complete with Pirates' Cove and Mermaids' Lagoon. (This being thepolitically correct '90s, no mention is made of Tiger Lily or the PiccaninniesIndian camp.) Still, these designs are hardly original. They're taken fromBarrie's text, early illustrations and, indeed, the 1953 Disney version.;  But enough about the look of &quot;Hook.&quot; How shipshape are the performances?Answer: Competent, but little more.;   It says a lot about Williams' turn thathe's much more vital and interesting as the bloated Banning than as thereconstituted Pan. Once back to his old boastful, swashbuckling self, Williamsattempts a comic impression of Errol Flynn in &quot;Captain Blood.&quot; It's amusingfor Williams' trademark improvs (&quot;What's this? Some 'Lord of the Flies'preschool,&quot; he says of the Lost Boys), but it's also familiar and somewhatlethargic. (Some of Williams' mid-flight moves will put you in mind of hismanic Popeye, the hero of another unfortunate exercise in screen fantasy.);  Hoffman as Hook is more impressive but, again, hardly definitive.;   Thoughobviously influenced by Cyril Richards' delightfully fey portrait in the MaryMartin version, Hoffman's Hook is much darker and introspective, betraying theactor's Method roots. At times he sounds like another kind of wharf rat, RatsoRizzo of &quot;Midnight Cowboy.&quot;;   To be sure, Hoffman has his moments, such aswhen he puts a gun to his temple and waits for boatswain's mate Smee (BobHoskins) to run his usual interference. Hoffman also has fun with Hook'shighborn disdain and narcissism. And he really comes into his own as the plottakes a sinister turn and he decides to win over and adopt Peter's son, Jack.;  Hoskins is amusing in a low-key way as the sycophantic, fair-weather Smee;Maggie Smith glows as usual as the original Wendy, now in her 90s; Amber Scottand Charlie Korsmo (Kid in &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;) do well enough by those stockkids-in-jeopardy roles; Caroline Goodall lends a soupcon of class as Moira,Wendy's granddaughter who won the heart of the 10-year-old Peter, thus causinghim to forsake Neverland.;   And Roberts as that moonbeam of a sprite, Tink?She's likable but also distant, removed from the main action, as Russ Tamblynwas in &quot;tom tumb.&quot; Roberts is most effective when the blue-screen effects aremost effective, such as when her fluttering image lights on Williams' chestand drags him by his bow tie, and when she tweaks Hook's bulbous nose.;  &quot;Hook&quot; isn't the washout Spielberg's &quot;1941&quot; and &quot;The Color Purple&quot; were, butit's hardly another &quot;E.T.&quot; or even &quot;The Goonies,&quot; the film maker's earlier Panvariation.;   Spielberg and company would have been smart to heed Barrie'sadvice and steer clear of Neverland. It was the author, after all, who said ofthe Lost Boys who quit Neverland, &quot;All the boys were grown up and done for bythis time; so it is scarcely worth while saying anything more about them.&quot;;  Or their fuzzy-headed, middle-aged leader, we can now add.; Hook;(star)(star); Rated: PG (slapstick violence); Cast: Dustin Hoffman, RobinWilliams, Julia Roberts; Director: Steven Spielberg; Writers: Jim V.
