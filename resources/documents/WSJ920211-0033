That system, which is still underdevelopment, will allow Microsoft's popular Windows programto run on larger computers, such as workstations. Windows,which now runs on personal computers, is a program that makessoftware easier to use by opening menus, or choosing iconswith a pointing device.   The strengthening of its ties to Digital, the No. 2computer maker, comes at a time when Microsoft's relationshave chilled with the industry leader, International BusinessMachines Corp. As reported, Digital recently agreed to be oneof a few computer makers that will display a Windows logo inits advertising and packaging. Last year, Microsoft saidDigital would manufacture many of Microsoft's officeproductivity applications, as part of what the company calleda &quot;pragmatic&quot; relationship between the two concerns.   However, Digital's decision to license a PC networkingsystem from Novell, of Provo, Utah, is a sign thatMicrosoft's networking software business continues tostruggle. Novell, which holds the lion's share of thatmarket, has been working with Digital since 1989.</TEXT></DOC>
