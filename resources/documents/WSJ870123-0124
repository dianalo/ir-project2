Her search through universities, libraries, bookstores and major companies was like looking for Playboy magazines in Sunday schools.    &quot;I was amazed,&quot; says Susan Goldman, the researcher. The only U.S. source for most Japanese journals was the Library of Congress. And, she adds, &quot;It didn't even know it had them unless someone asked for them. And no one asked.&quot;    Until recently, the flow of technological information between the U.S. and Japan was mostly a one-way street going to the East. But that is changing fast, spurred by the threat of Japanese domination in major technology markets and by reports such as Ms. Goldman's. The U.S. is beginning to close its information gap with Japan.    Computerized data bases containing English translations of Japanese technical publications are proliferating. Last November, for example, InfoCorp, a Cupertino, Calif., market-research firm, began offering one based on a system developed by ODS Corp. of Tokyo. Japanese Technical Information Service, of Media, Pa., contends that its data base of abstracts from some 600 Japanese journals is the largest English-language source of technical information from Japan.    But only so much can be gleaned from journals -- a fact long recognized in Japan, which annually sends abroad thousands of students and company men to learn about foreign research. Thus, during the past few years, several U.S. universities have sent students to study technology at Japanese companies and schools.    Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for example, began sending young researchers to Japan in 1983. Under its auspices, 20 students, most with graduate degrees, are studying at Kobe University, Nippon Steel Corp., Sony Corp. and other Japanese schools and companies, says Richard Samuels, who directs the MIT-Japan technology program. Sponsors include American companies, such as International Business Machines Corp., and Japanese institutions, such as Japan's Ministry of Education.    Similar programs are under way at North Carolina State University and the University of Wisconsin. Several other schools, such as NYU, recently have started offering technology degrees with concentrations in Japanese and plan eventually to send students to Japan. And within about a year, Stanford University plans to open a Japanese campus that will include a technology center.    What can U.S. science and engineering students learn in Japan?    Though behind the U.S. in many fields, Japan is generally considered ahead in research on combining electronics with optical fibers, fermentation technology used for making drugs, semiconductor manufacturing and a few other crucial areas. Moreover, Japan has mastered the art of turning good ideas into good products.    &quot;The Japanese make a relentless, steady push forward in research which is so thorough that they pick up things we miss,&quot; says Alan Engel, a Philadelphia biochemist. He adds that he learned his current specialty -- making ultrathin films for electronic components -- in Japan. Ironically, the technology was invented in the U.S. in the 1930s and forgotten.    Japanese companies welcome U.S. visitors to a surprising extent. Michael Caine, an MIT graduate student who studied image processing last year at Toshiba Corp., lived in a company dormitory, did daily calisthenics with company employees, wore a company uniform and sat in on research-planning sessions.    However, he had agreed with Toshiba not to divulge any of its research secrets for two years. And &quot;if they didn't want me to understand something at a meeting,&quot; he adds, &quot;they would just talk faster&quot; -- too fast for his limited Japanese.    The companies' welcome for U.S. students, MIT's Mr. Samuels says, springs from several motives -- desire for international contacts, fear that closed doors in Japan will encourage U.S. protectionism, and sincere gratitude for U.S. contributions to Japanese technology. An element of pride also is involved: &quot;The Japanese boss of one of our students told me,&quot; Mr. Samuels says, &quot;'When I was was young, I dreamed of going to MIT but never made it. Now, MIT is coming here.'&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
