For systematization of survey informations, the standardizationand unification of data is required for DBS. On the other hand, not onlythe general idea of a geothermal reservoir itself but also techniquesfor data is changing. A lot of data are recorded in diversified media.Accordingly, for enhancement of the data availability, the data are digitizedand on-lined, in advance to constitute DBS suitable for the computation.If the use of data is wrongly estimated, the data are filed in vain.One experimental example of data systematization is SIGMA by GeologicalSurvey of Japan. SIGMA has functions of information retrieval, display,output, and data analysis. Generally, the maintenance and managementof DBS expensive. Sufficient examination from the long period viewpointis required for adoption of DBS. Close communication between data andDBS is necessary for further improvement of the system.
