Brown said the counselors also had scheduled a meeting withparents to discuss their fears.   Bates' wife, Adria Bates, 40, a teacher aide at the school,suffered gunshot wounds to the scalp and back. She remained instable condition at Jefferson Davis Memorial Hospital.   ``It was humiliating to the children and to the other staff,''Mrs. Bates said from her hospital bed.   She said she recently filed for divorce and that Bates had``been hearing a lot of untrue rumors.'' She didn't elaborate.   The two teachers who were raped and beaten also were taken toJefferson Davis Hospital for treatment.   Assistant Police Chief George Rutherford said officers receiveda report of a man on the campus about 1:30 p.m.   Bates was arrested after an instructor grabbed a .38-caliberrevolver from him as he was holding the children and teachershostage, he said. Two shots were fired in the classroom.   Rutherford said Bates had lined the 5- and 6-year-old childrenin front of windows _ between himself and police.
