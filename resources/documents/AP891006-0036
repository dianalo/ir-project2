Billy Graham. ``God's work is not dependent upon one person _it is dependent upon the Holy Spirit.   Bakker was convicted Thursday in Charlotte, N.C., of bilking hisfollowers in the promotion of his Heritage USA religious retreatand theme park near Fort Mill, S.C. Prosecutors said Bakkerdiverted $3.7 million of ministry money to pay for his lavishlifestyle. He faces a maximum sentence of 120 years in prison and$5 million in fines.   ``There are still countless thousands of men and women in theministry _ serving as pastors, teachers, missionaries andevangelists _ being faithful to what God has called them to do,many of them on very low incomes,'' said Graham.   The Rev. Robert Schuller, a TV evangelist who preaches from theCrystal Cathedral in Garden Grove, Calif., said: ``Now that thejury has reached a verdict I am optimistic because Americans willknow that it is safe to trust in trust again.   ``I'm thankful that this sad, sorry, pathetic story has come toan end. I think a lot of people will realize how easy good peoplewith good intentions can get off track.''   The Rev. Jerry Falwell said evangelists can get on withspreading God's word now that Bakker has been convicted.   ``While I am personally sorry for Mr. Bakker, his family, andthe thousands who have been hurt by the PTL saga, I am pleased thatthis dark chapter of religious history has concluded,'' Falwellsaid from Dallas, where he was attending a meeting.   Falwell, who briefly took over PTL at Bakker's request when heresigned in 1987, said he had ``no interest in defending my briefinvolvement with PTL some two and a half years ago, as that hasalready been well documented.''   Employees at Bakker's current ministry, operating out of ashopping center in Orlando, Fla., were stunned by the conviction.   ``I can't believe it. I think there's been some kind ofmistake,'' said Don Baldwin, acting general manager of Jim andTammy Ministries, which runs a church and produces a televisionshow broadcast by eight cable outlets.   Bakker resigned from PTL after confessing to a sexual encounterwith former church secretary Jessica Hahn.   ``I don't feel sad for what happened to Bakker,'' Hahn, 30, toldThe Associated Press. ``I'd like to look him in the eye and tellhim `get out the rowboat, you can't walk on water.'   The Assemblies of God, which defrocked Bakker in May 1987, lastmonth launched a 10-year effort to win over 5 million people, open5,000 new churches and train 20,000 new ministers.   ``The church did what it had to do in 1987 and we feel we haveput that behind us and we are going on with the business of thechurch,'' said Juleen Turnage, spokeswoman for the 2.5million-member denomination.</TEXT></DOC>
