An experiment was made using the combinationof a plasticized resin hose and the ANFO charger as the method for makingthe most of the ANFO explosive aiming at charging a hole with the explosiveat a low cost without damaging the hole wall. The experimental resultindicates that any water hole with spring water can be charged with theexplosive using the ANFO charger combined with the plasticized resinhose. The method is superior to conventional methods in cost and workabilitybecause the working atmosphere is not aggravated and the hole wall isnot damaged without using an expensive vacuum collector. Charging a blastinghole 165 mm or less in diameter with the explosive will be investigatedfor commercialization in future. (4 figs)</TEXT></DOC>
