The final rule was scheduled to become effective 60 daysafter publication, or October 31, 1989. The paperwork requirements of thefinal rule had not been approved by the Office of Management and Budget(OMB) at the time the final rule was issued. OMB received OSHA's requestfor review of the paperwork requirements on September 21, 1989, and issuedits approval on September 26, 1989. OSHA published a supplemental noticeto that effect on October 17, 1989 (54 FR 42498). Because the OMB approvalwas received prior to the original effective date of the final rule, theeffective date of October 31, 1989 was not affected.Since the final rule was published, OSHA has received several requestsfor extension of the period for compliance, together with at least onepetition for a temporary variance from the standard. After carefully evaluatingthese requests, and in consideration of the information discussed below,OSHA has determined that there is good cause to further delay the effectivedate of the final rule.As was noted in the September 1, 1989 final rule, the lockout/tagout standardrequires employers to develop and utilize an energy control program anddocumented procedures, and to provide employees with training in the utilizationof these energy control measures. Because this is a ``generic'' rule, whichapplies to a wide range of machines and equipment, the employer must tailorthe general provisions of the standard to the particular energy controlsituations encountered in that employer's workplace. In addition, the finalrule adds various hardware requirements for lockout and tagout devices.Because of the breadth of the rule and the elements necessary for developingand implementing an effective energy control program, OSHA now believesthat the original October 31, 1989 effective date has not provided adequatetime for employers to come into compliance with the standard, and thatan additional two month delay in the effective date is warranted.Although the effective date of the standard has been delayed, as notedabove, OSHA will still require employees to be protected from the unexpectedenergization or start up of machines and equipment during servicing andmaintenance operations, and will enforce this employer obligation undersection 5(a)(1) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (the ``generalduty clause'' of the Act). This provision of the Act requires the employerto provide a workplace and place of work which is free from recognizedhazards which are, or are likely, to cause death or serious physical harm.This document was prepared under the direction of Gerard F. Scannell, AssistantSecretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health, U.S. Departmentof Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20210. It is issuedunder the authority of sections 4, 6(b), and 8(c) of the Occupational Safetyand Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 653, 655, 657), Secretary of Labor'sOrder No. 9-83 (48 FR 35736), and 29 CFR part 1911.Accordingly, the requirements of the Lockout/Tagout standard, 29 CFR 1910.147,are suspended until January 2, 1990.<ITAG tagnum="21">Signed at Washington, DC, this 31st day of October 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">G.F.
