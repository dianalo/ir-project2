The three companies struck a definitive deal in April.</LP><TEXT>   The commission, which can block the planned transaction,said it is concerned that the purchase would give theFranco-Italian consortium an unfair advantage in the Europeanmarket for commuter aircraft. Aerospatiale and Alenia alreadycooperate in making commuter planes in their Avions deTransport Regional venture.   Under EC rules, a decision on whether to approve or blockthe acquisition must be made within four months. If thecommission approves the transaction, it also could imposemarketing or other conditions on Aerospatiale and Alenia toensure that competitors have a fair shot at selling commuterplanes in the EC.   The Franco-Italian group manufactures the ATR-42 andATR-72 commuter planes. De Havilland makes another short-haulmodel, called the Dash-8. Their main competitors are BritishAerospace, Sweden's Saab-Scania AB, the Netherlands' NVFokker, Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain and Embraerof Brazil.   The acquisition of de Havilland would help ATR boost itsproduct line in an increasingly competitive sector. Demandfor commuter aircraft in Europe is expected to increasebecause of liberalization of the EC's heavily regulated airtransport industry after 1992. Analysts estimate theworld-wide market for commuter planes at $3.5 billion a year.ATR accounts for about 25% of world-wide deliveries and deHavilland for about 15%.   The acquisition is also being investigated by authoritiesin Canada, where de Havilland is based. Boeing, based inSeattle, bought de Havilland from the Canadian government in1986 for $112 million. Boeing has poured vast sums into themoney-losing Canadian company, and the operation continues tobe a drain on its resources.   Aerospatiale and Alenia declined to comment on the ECCommission's move. The two state-owned companies haven'tdisclosed the purchase price for de Havilland, although ithas been estimated at $200 million or less.   Boeing officials close to the transaction couldn't bereached for comment.</TEXT></DOC>
