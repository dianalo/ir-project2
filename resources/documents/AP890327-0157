Ortega, speaking to 60 Harvard scholars from 37 countries,accused the United States of ignoring a Central American peace planthat commits regional leaders to drafting a program by mid-May todismantle the rebel force.   He said of the bipartisan aid package unveiled Friday inWashington, ``It reaffirms once again the policy that the strongestcan act without regard for the will of others.''   The proposal, worked out between the Bush administration andcongressional leaders, provides $4.5 million a month innon-military aid to the rebels, known as Contras. The current $27.1million in humanitarian aid runs out Friday.   The package proposes aid at least through November and couldcontinue through Feb. 28, 1990, if congressional committees approve.   ``If the U.S. Congress were respectful of our accord, it wouldapprove aid for 90 days, and gear it to the dismantling of theContras,'' Ortega told the gathering of Mason Fellowship scholars,in Nicaragua on a one-day visit.   ``What they're trying to do is maintain intact a force inHonduran territory, which is like a cannon aimed at Nicaragua. Thepresident of Honduras himself has insisted he has not agreed thatthe Contras remain for another 10 months or a year.''   He said Congress ``still has time to rectify, and show itsrespect for the will of the Central American presidents.''   Ortega moved up general elections in Nicaragua by 10 months toFeb. 25, 1990, as part of the regional peace plan he and thepresidents of El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and Costa Ricareached in El Salvador on Feb. 14.   The presidents agreed to come up with a plan by mid-May todemobilize up to 11,000 Contras living in Honduran jungle campsnear Nicaragua with about 12,000 relatives.   Most guerrillas moved from Nicaragua into the camps afterCongress cut off military aid in February 1988. A month later, theContras and Sandinistas signed a cease-fire, which Nicaragua hasbeen extending every month since.   Ortega said Congress might consider redirecting the proposed $45million in aid to Nicaragua, which could use the money to build9,000 homes for victims of last October's Hurricane Joan.   He said with $45 million, Nicaragua could buy food to feed750,000 people for seven months, or milk for 2.8 million children.   ``That indeed would be humanitarian aid,'' Ortega said. ``Wehope this is a document with a rhetorical tint ... and that deepinside it really is looking for a peaceful solution. But theiractions will be the determinant'' factor.   Responding to questions, Ortega said he finds it inconceivablethat the ruling Sandinista National Liberation Front could losenext year's elections.   ``The people would have to be crazy to vote against the Front ... against the revolution,'' Ortega said. ``The peasant, the workerwho has seen his wife, his son killed by the Contras is not goingto vote against the Front.''   He said Nicaraguans have ``discovered the ... capacity ofcapitalism to exploit them, to keep them in ignorance, the capacityto deny them the right to organize. ... Now, the day the peopledon't want any more revolution, they have the vote and the weaponsin their hands. The people decide. The Front cannot impose anythingon the people.''   Barricada, the official Sandinista paper, and the pro-governmentEl Nuevo Diario said Monday the U.S. aid package is proof theSandinistas won Nicaragua's eight-year civil war.   ``U.S. Makes Official Nicaragua's Triumph,'' said El NuevoDiario's headline.   Erick Ramirez of the Social-Christian Party said the U.S. aidproposal sounded the rebels' death knell.   It ``effectively foresees the end of the war,'' he said in aninterview. ``The war has no future and I believe the United Statesmust channel its efforts in that direction.''</TEXT></DOC>
