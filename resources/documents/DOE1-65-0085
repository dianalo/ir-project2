The heat regenerator is detachable at one end froma burner, and at its other end from a reversing valve. The regeneratorcomprises two axially engaging portions, the front portion comprisinga cylindrical heat storage bed and a surrounding annular layer of a ceramicfibre insulation material. The rear portion comprises a cylindrical bodyof refractory material having a bore forming a bottle-neck type passagetapering towards the valve. The heat storage bed comprises a monolithicrefractory block through which a multiplicity of axially aligned gas-carryingchannels extends. These channels convey combustion products from theburner portion to the regenerator portion in one mode of operation wherethe bed is extracting heat from the products for storage. In anothermode of operation, the channels convey air from the regenerator portionto the burner portion so that the air can be heated by the stored heatnow released from the bed.</TEXT></DOC>
