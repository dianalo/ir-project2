Closely held Codelco is a New York holding company for Colonial Savings Bank, Roselle Park, N.J.    As of March 31, Central Jersey had more than 1.2 million shares outstanding. Yesterday, the shares leaped $4, to close at $19 in national over-the-counter trading.    Colonial said on April 15, it proposed the transaction in a letter sent to Central Jersey's board. The plan would give Central Jersey holders $24 plus a share of Codelco preferred with a stated value of $10.    In a statement, Central Jersey said, among other things, that Colonial managers, who include some former Central Jersey employees, haven't &quot;demonstrated the ability on any sustained basis to generate profits from operations.&quot;    Colonial said &quot;the combination of an extremely thin trading market for Central Jersey's shares and the general condition of both the public capital markets and the savings-and-loan industry makes this offer particularly attractive to Central Jersey's shareholders.&quot;    A spokesman for Colonial said the company is evaluating its options. </TEXT></DOC>
