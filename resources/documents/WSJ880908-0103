Most of it will go to people making more than $200,000 a year. That's not building an economy; that's feathering a nest.&quot;    It's too much to expect a great deal of logic in political discussions, especially when they're about business and economics. Perhaps it's best to recall that special treatment of capital gains was an effort to make our economy function better -- it prospers in large part because some people are willing to risk money developing products and processes.    Our ordinary income-tax system discourages risk-taking. Paul A. Samuelson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology put it this way in his textbook, &quot;Economics&quot;: &quot;Taxing a retired innovator's income may seem to have no distorting effects. But we must not forget the young innovator who can then no longer look forward to reaping a tidy sum from his new ideas. He may decide to take that civil service job or remain thirteenth vice-president of a bank. You cannot tax the results of an old innovation without somewhat affecting the prospects of an as-yet-unborn innovation.    &quot;If Congress taxes risky activities more heavily than routine activities, what can any reasonable person expect to happen? People will naturally tend to avoid venturous fields and to gravitate toward routine, steady ones.&quot;    Some other industrial nations have attacked this problem by taxing capital gains lightly or not at all. The U.S. for many years taxed capital gains less heavily than ordinary income but imposed a strict limit on the deduction of the losses that normally go along with risk-taking.    But the 1986 revenue act, which was advertised as monumental tax reform, taxed capital gains as ordinary income. Well, that's not quite true. The law retained limitations on the deduction of losses, so, as matters now stand, capital gains are taxed more heavily than ordinary income. It's a good plan to steer more young people toward careers as 13th vice presidents.    The 1986 act was supposed to be a Reagan administration achievement, but the Republicans seem to recognize that it had its limitations. The GOP campaign platform doesn't refer to the 1986 act when it calls for a cut in the tax rate on long-term capital gains &quot;to promote investment in jobs and to raise revenue for the federal government.&quot; Instead, in a nice bit of bipartisanship, it refers to a Carter-era capital-gains rate cut as well as the cut adopted in the first year of the Reagan administration. As a result of these cuts, the platform says, capital-gains tax revenues rose 184% from 1978 to 1985.    Even some friends of Gov. Dukakis appear to believe that something went wrong. Investment banker Felix Rohatyn, who might be treasury secretary in a Dukakis administration, has suggested a lower tax rate on long-term capital gains.    The 1986 act did promote a short-term burst of revenue. The law went into effect Jan. 1, 1987, and there was a rush to realize gains before the higher rate took effect. The rate for the average capital-gains taxpayer jumped to 21% from 9%, and realizations in 1986 were nearly double the 1985 level.    In fact, the revenue increase from the capital-gains tax rise looks like a one-shot affair, due entirely to the rush to beat the increase. Lawrence Lindsey of Harvard examined several economic models and concluded, &quot;The prospects that the higher marginal tax rates on capital gains in the new tax law will produce more capital-gains-tax revenue seem remote. . . . The response of gains to permanent tax-rate changes produces a smaller amount of revenue in four of the five models and static revenue in the fifth.&quot;    What tax planners often seem to forget is that realization and taxation of capital gains are largely at the discretion of the taxpayer. In an average year, only a small portion of the accrued gain will actually be realized. Faced with what Prof. Lindsey says may well have been the largest capital-gains tax-rate increase since the advent of the income tax in 1913, it would be normal for many taxpayers to opt to hold onto their assets a bit longer.    The capital-gains tax-rate increase, ironically enough, came at a time when increasing U.S. competitiveness had seemed to have become a bipartisan cause. Last October's stock-market crash led to a variety of proposals for discouraging &quot;speculation,&quot; which is usually the villain when the market drops. Most such proposals were aimed at discouraging speculation without deterring long-term investment.    Gov. Dukakis may be right when he says that most of the benefits of Mr. Bush's capital-gains tax cut would go to taxpayers with incomes over $200,000. However, he may have a hard time selling that argument politically. As Prof. Lindsey says, most of the individual recipients of capital gains have incomes of less than $50,000 a year. Taxpayers with incomes under $30,000 generally saw a tripling of their capital-gains tax rates.    The politicians who drafted the 1986 act thus committed one error their predecessors avoided. Experimentation with capital-gains law had been common for many years. In another study, Prof. Lindsey considered the period 1965-1982. Changes in the law occurred, on the average, every other year. However, &quot;in the case of taxpayers earning under $50,000 . . . the variation in tax rates was quite small.    &quot;Over that 18-year period, the average marginal tax rate on capital gains for these taxpayers varied between a high of 13.8% in 1969 and a low of 10.6% in 1979.&quot; Thus, for the vast majority of capital-gains recipients, tax-rate rises such as they saw in 1986 were without precedent.    The 1986 act thus was bad politics as well as bad economics. Norman Ture, who was an architect of the Reagan administration supply-side tax cuts, summed it up this way at a Cato Institute conference:   &quot;Implementation of the entrepreneurial zest for starting new businesses and for risky, innovative ventures requires the infusion of capital, very often supplied by outside investors. For both outside investors and entrepreneurs, the reward sought is primarily an increase in the value of the equity investment in the venture.    &quot;For outside investors, in particular, it is important to be able to realize the appreciated capital and to transfer it into promising new ventures. Raising the tax on capital gains blunts the inducement for undertaking these ventures in the first place.&quot;    It's surely no way to make the U.S. more competitive. </TEXT></DOC>
