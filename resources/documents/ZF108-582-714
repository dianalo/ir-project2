 When the hype grows heavy for this long-awaitedversion of Microsoft's graphical operating environment, or when you recallbeing disappointed by extravagant promises about earlier versions, whatremains important is this: Windows 3.0 works.andP;  It will make every moment youspend at your PC more productive and more enjoyable.andM;For starters, Windows 3.0 eliminates the 640K barrier for DOS, simplifies theoperation of every program, makes child's play of complex tasks involvingseveral programs, and improves the printed output of all your work.andP;  It alsoallows software developers to build far better applications than would haveever been possible under character-mode DOS.andM;Windows 3.0 lifts the technological barriers that have kept you from takingfull advantage of your PC.andP;  It lets you do better work, and do it faster andmore easily than has ever been possible on a PC.andM;For business users, Windows 3.0 is better than the Mac.andP;  Better than the NeXTmachine.andP;  Better than any other computing platform yhou care to name.andP;  Andit's so much better than character-mode DOS that it should ignite the biggestchange the computing world is likely to see in the first half of the 1990s:the mass adoption of multitasking, graphical operating environments.andP;  Next toWindows 3.0, the strongest character-mode DOS application is as obsolete as avacuum-tube TV.andM;In short, Windows 3.0 represents a great new beginning for PC users.andP;  Itoffers multitasking that works, a graphical interface that works, andapplications with more power and flexibility than the character-mode DOSworld has ever seen.andM;Those who have watched Windows 3.0 in action can't believe that Microsoft wasable to make it so much better.andP;  Virtually every aspect of Windows has beenimproved:andM;* Appearance Good looks are by no means everything, but they do count.andP;  AndWindows 3.0 has the kind of looks that stop traffic.andP;  Its 3-D buttons, coloricons, and proportional system fonts make its appearance as exciting asWindows 2's was bland.andP;  And they set the stage for this version's moresubstantive improvements.andM;* User interface The much-maligned MS-DOS Executive that the earlier Windowsversions used as a program launcher and file manager is gone.andP;  It has beenreplaced by two solid programs: the Program Manager, which lets you launchany installed DOS- or Windows-based program merely by double-clicking on theicon that represents it, and the File Manager, which presents amultiwindowed, tree-oriented view of your disks and provides you with a wideselection of standard file management tools.andM;The Program Manager lets you work on a plane far above the DOS filestructure.andP;  With it, you can group program icons into Program Groups nomatter where the files they represent reside.andP;  Because these groups do notmirror the physical organization of your disk, you can create task-relatedgroups, such as &quot;Financials,&quot; so that icons representing programs like 1-2-3or Excel appear in each folder--something you can't do on the Macintoshwithout replicating the program files.andP;  You can also set the icons in aProgram Group to represent program/document combinations.andP;  An icon labeled&quot;Western Region Financials&quot; (Program Manager icons aren't restricted to DOS'seight-letter filenames) might represent both the program Excel and aworksheet containing financial results for your firm's western sales region.andO;Clicking on the icon would load both the program and the worksheet.andM;The File Manager, on the other hand, gives you all the advantages of awell-designed DOS shell, but adds capabilities derived from Windows'graphical environment.andP;  It lets you view a multiple-window display of yourdisk's tree structure and directory contents, move entire directories simplyby dragging their folder-like icons to another location on the tree, andlaunch programs by dragging a document associated with them onto the program.andO;The File Manager recognizes and works with network and CD-ROM drives and letsyou link to or disconnect network drives from its menus.andM;The Windows 3.0 user interface also benefits from new controls and features.andO;Two particularly valuable ones are editable listboxes (editable text fieldswith a drop-down list of alternative choices) and the new multiple documentinterface (a simple way for applications to use several document windows,each of which you can &quot;iconize&quot;).andM;* Memory management Windows 3.0's improved use of RAM is a real achievement.andO;What good is a better user interface if you still run out of memory at everyturn, as with previous versions of Windows?andP;  With Windows 3.0, you don't.andM;As long as you're using a 80286- or 80386-based PC with at least 1MB of RAM,Windows 3.0 (and Windows-based applications) will run in the microprocessors'protected mode, which means that it can use all the RAM between 640K and 1MBthat DOS normally ignores, plus any above 1MB.andP;  This memory managementscheme, which is called Standard Mode, leads to an immediate and dramaticimprovement in the amount of RAM available to Windows applications and henceto a dramatic improvement in their performance.andP;  And it eliminates theendless need to find a configuration for your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYSfiles that will scrape out another 5K of RAM.andM;The result is what seems like the world's cheapest RAM upgrade.andP;  A programsuch as Word for Windows, which was a struggle to load on a machine with 1MBof RAM under Windows 286, will suddenly tell you that it has 200K to 300K offree RAM when you install Windows 3.0.andP;  And if you put a second megabyte ofRAM into your machine, that figure might increase to more than a megabyte offree RAM.andP;  Because Windows applications run in protected mode, they are nolonger limited by the so-called 640K barrier.andM;Windows 3.0 can use two additional memory modes, depending upon yourhardware: Real mode and 386 Enhanced mode.andP;  Under Real mode, Windows 3.0 usesa memory management scheme similar to that of Windows/286: all activeprograms must reside in the lower 640K, but inactive programs and data canuse expanded memory above 1MB.andP;  In most cases, only machines withmicroprocessors that do not support protected-mode operation (8088, 8086,V20, or V30) would use real mode, since it lacks the memory and performancebenefits of Standard mode.andM;386 Enhanced mode, available on 80386- and 80486-based machines with morethan 2MB of RAM, adds two important capabilities to those offered by Standardmode: the ability to run character-based DOS applications in a window ratherthan in a full screen (previously found in Windows/386), and virtual memory,a way of using hard-disk space to simulate RAM so that Windows 3.0 canperform as if it has access to many times as much RAM as is actuallyavailable.andP;  On a 4MB 80386, Windows 3.0 might report having as much as 14MBof RAM available for use, depending on how much space on your hard drive isfree.andP;  This virtual memory is available even to character-mode DOSapplications running under Windows 3.0 on a 80386- or 80486-based PC.andP;  Forinstance, when we ran 1-2-3 Release 2 under Windows 3.0, 4MB of EMS memorywas reported available, even though three other applications were runningsimultaneously in an 80386 PC equipped with a total of just 4MB of RAM.andO;Moreover, because Windows 3.0 can continue to operate Windows programs whilekeeping as little as 16K of their code in physical RAM, using virtual RAMinvolves negligible slowdown in performance.andM;The only drawback to Windows 3.0's 386 Enhanced mode is that character-basedprograms using DOS extenders to access memory beyond 640K (such as theinitial version of Lotus 1-2-3 Release 3) cannot run in this mode.andP;  However,they can run in Windows 3.0's Standard and Real modes, and Microsoft isworking with makers of the extender software to solve the problem thatprevents their use in 386 Enhanced mode.andP;  (Release 3.1 of 1-2-3, which isscheduled to ship in the third quarter, will run in all Windows 3.0 memorymodes.)andM;* MultitaskingandM;The multitasking capabilities of Windows work much better in Version 3.0,thanks to the memory-management capabilities of Standard and 386 Enhancedmodes.andP;  In earlier versions of the operating environment, it was barelypossible to get just one program running smoothly most of the time, let alonethe two or more needed for DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange, a way for Windowsapplications to communicate with one another; see &quot;Windows' DDE: Glue forData,&quot; next page).andP;  Even though previous Windows versions theoreticallyallowed you to run multiple applications at once, in practice you almostalways had to close one application before you could start another, no matterhow much RAM you had installed.andM;Under Windows 3.0, you can easily keep six or more applications open and moveamong them at will, even on a machine that has as little as 2MB of RAM.andM;* SetupandM;The setup programs for the old versions of Windows were a nightmare.andP;  Anychange you made in your hardware configuration forced you to repeat theentire Windows installation procedure from scratch.andP;  Microsoft has addressedthis problem in Windows 3.0 by simplifying the setup program and by lettingyou change nearly every aspect of Windows' configuration from within Windows.andO;(See the new Environments column in Help for installation advice, page 234.)andM;* Network supportandM;Earlier versions of Windows barely tolerated local area networks.andP;  Windows3.0 provides explicit support for them, allowing you to attach and detachnetwork drives from the File Manager, manipulate network print queues fromthe Print Manager, configure network printers from within any application,and perform almost any network-related task from the Control Panel.andM;* Desktop accessoriesandM;Most of the desktop accessories and applications provided with older versionsof Windows were almost useless.andP;  Write was fine for limited word processing,but how much benefit dwelled in a paint program, such as Paint, that didn'tsupport color, or a communications program, such as Terminal, that didn'tsupport protocol file transfers?andM;Windows 3.0 has improved the lineup dramatically.andP;  There is a new Paint,based on ZSoft's PC Paint-brush color painting program, and a new Terminal,consisting of a scaled-down version of Future Soft Engineering's DynaCommthat offers XModem and Kermit transfers.andP;  (For access to other protocols orto DynaComm's powerful script language, you'll need to purchase the fullproduct.)andP;  Similarly, the clock and calculator accessories have beenenhanced, and there are two newcomers to the lineup: Recorder, a simple buteffective macro recorder that captures and plays back keystrokes and mousemovements, and Solitaire, an addictive version of the classic card pastime.andM;* Standardized helpandM;Online help has been hit-or-miss in Mac and Windows programs.andP;  Someapplications developers have offered great help facilities, while others, toolazy to write help routines, claim that their applications are so intuitivethat none is needed.andP;  With Windows 3.0, developers can take advantage of astandard help engine that makes it easy for them to set up acontext-sensitive, online help facility with such features as bookmarks, atopic index, and the ability to search the help file for the topic you need.andO;Almost every Windows developer we interviewed said that they intended to takeadvantage of this facility.andM;* ApplicationsandM;The Windows environment is already blessed by some of the finest applicationsever seen, and more are coming almost daily.andM;The difference with Windows 3.0 is the degree to which it enhances, ratherthan restricts, the applications that work with it.andP;  While applicationsrunning under Windows 2.x were the beneficiaries of such features as astandardized user interface and standard methods for copying, pasting, andcutting data, they suffered so much from its memory constraints and poorperformance that the overall benefit they gained from the Windows environmentwas negligible.andP;  With the elimination of those constraints in Windows 3.0, ithas suddenly become glaringly obvious just how great the best Windowsapplications are--and how their ability to work in concert with one anotherleaves their character-mode counterparts in the dust.andM;Is Microsoft Excel better than Lotus 1-2-3?andP;  On a standalone basis, it's tooclose to call.andP;  But when you consider Excel's ability to gain access, viaDDE, to the document management features of the Saros Corporation'sFileShare, the scheduling capabilities of Polaris PackRat, the reportingstrength of Word for Windows, the graphics presentation power of Designer orPowerPoint, and the communications features of DynaComm, 1-2-3 doesn't standa chance in a Windows environment.andM;Putting It All TogetherandM;No mere list of features conveys the full significance of Windows 3.0'simprovements.andP;  Nor does it indicate how enjoyable the computing experiencebecomes under the program.andP;  Terms such as multitasking and memory managementsound grand, but they don't convey the feel of using Windows 3.0.andP;  They don'tproclaim that here at last is an environment that rewards, not punishes, theuser; here at last is PC software that doesn't have to hang its head around aMac; here at last is an environment that enhances every application writtenfor it.andM;But a few minutes of use will convince you that Windows 3.0 offers much morethan efficient and useful multitasking.andP;  Windows simply provides a bettercomputing experience, replete with applications that are better than anycharacter-based application could ever be and capabilities that are farbeyond the imagination of anyone who hasn't seen them at work.andM;Watch someone who works regularly with a collection of Windows applications,let's say Ami Professional, IBM Current, Crosstalk for Windows, andSuperBase.andP;  Compare their activities, the work they produce and how theyproduce it.andP;  Take a look, too, at someone who uses WordPerfect, Agenda,Crosstalk XVI, and dBASE IV.andP;  Sure, the work produced by the Windows userlooks prettier, but that's just the tip f the iceberg.andP;  Because the basics ofhow to use every Windows application--how to open files, how to copy data,how to print--are the same, the Windows user doesn't have to struggle withlearning them for each application.andP;  Instead, Windows users can devote theirenergies to the job they're trying to do.andM;Moreover, each application's advanced, specialized features are much morewithin the reach of Windowns users because the consistency of the Windowsinterface makes learning to use each of them easier.andP;  In contrast, knowinghow to read a file in a character-mode application provides no clue toprinting in that application, let alone reading a file in anotherapplication.andM;In addition, Windows users have a far greater ability to customizeapplications than users of character-mode DOS.andP;  The adventurous end user can,with no programming experience, customize menus, integrate tasks spanningmultiple applications, and otherwise turn a collection of diverse programsinto a highly personalized suite of applications tuned to the needs of his orher job.andM;Paying the PiperandM;All this magic has a price, of course.andP;  And it comes primarily in the form ofhardware requirements.andM;Technically, Windows 3.0 will run on any PC with 640K of memory and a CGA orbetter color screen or a Hercules monochrome screen, with or without a mouse.andM;The realistic requirements are considerably greater: a fast (12MHz at a bareminimum) 80286 or 80386 with a minimum of 1MB (preferably 2MB) of RAM, amouse, an EGA or VGA color display, and a big, fast hard disk.andP;  (The Windowsenvironment eats up over 6MB of hard disk space, and more if you see virtualmemory in 386 Enhanced Mode.)andM;Give Windows 3.0 that kind of hardware configuration and it will amaze you.andO;If you ask it to run on a less capable machine, you're bound to bedisappointed.andP;  So what do you do if you've got an 8088- or 8086-based PC?andO;Congratulate yourself for owning one of the world's best single-tasking,character-mode machines, and save your pennies to buy the fast 80286 or 80386that will set Windows free.andM;If your problem with running Windows is simply one of not enough RAM or harddisk space, the solution is even easier.andP;  Upgrade.andP;  RAM prices are down tounder $100 per megabyte, and hard disks cost well below $10 per megabyte.andO;The cost of upgrading simply isn't enough reason to deny yourself thebenefits of Windows.andM;Users of earlier versions of Windows also pay a price in terms ofcompatibility with Windows 3.0.andP;  Windows 3.0 changes some of the rules towhich Windows-based applications must adhere (actually, it simply enforcesrules that have been there for a long time), and so most older Windowsapplications need to be updated to run in Windows 3.0's Standard or 386Enhanced modes.andP;  For the most part, Windows developers are making thisupgrade process as painless as possible (see &quot;Power and Glory: 36 GreatApplications Take Advantage,&quot; page 80), providing Windows 3.0-compatibleversions of their programs to registered users at little or not cost.andM;What About OS/2?andM;Windows 3.0 comes along at a time when many PC users have resigned themselvesto waiting for OS/2 Presentation Manager to mature before they could obtain atruly effective graphical environment on the PC.andP;  Windows 3.0 can changethose plans.andP;  It doesn't supply all the advanced capabilities of OS/2, butthe value of those capabilities to end-user applications has not yet beendemonstrated.andP;  Windows 3.0 eliminates the need to move to OS/2 simply toobtain a variable graphical operating environment.andM;The Windows-vs.-OS/2 debate is, in a pivotal sense, moot.andP;  The biggest andmost important change in the end-user computing experience is not whatresults from the change from DOS to OS/2, but what results in moving from asingle-tasking, character-based environment to a multitasking graphics-basedone.andP;  What counts most is the ability to move data effortlessly amongapplications, the ability to apply the skills learned in one application tothe use of another, and the ability to customize applications easily--all ofwhich are available under both OS/2 and Windows.andM;In the long run, those who need OS/2 will migrate to it, and those who don'twill stick to Windws.andP;  The migration won't be difficult or dramatic becausethe biggest mind shift and benefit will have already been made in adoptingWindows.andM;Some analysts have suggested from time to time that the slow adoption ofprevious versions of Windows indicates that PC users don't want or needgraphical environments.andP;  They're mistaken.andP;  Earlier versions of Windows justdidn't work well enough to be a realistic choice for many users.andP;  Windows 3.0does.andP;  Moreover, it's only going to get better.andP;  We can expect furtherenhancements in Windows itself in the near future, including scalable outlinefonts and powerful enhancements to DDE.andP;  And we can expect to see amazingapplications for Windows coming fast and furious.andM;A slew of Windows 3.0-specific applications are bottlenecked in thedevelopment pipeline.andP;  And Windows 3.0 has lured a number of developers toswift action post haste, including Borland, WordPerfect, and Lotus.andP;  Each newpowerhouse application makes the entire Windows environment better andprovides more reason to move beyond character-mode DOS.andM;Windows 3.0 makes it clear that the PC standard we have known for eightyears--that of a single-tasking, text-oriented engine for running complex,rigidly structured commercial applications--is an out-moded relic.andP;  In itsplace, Windows 3.0 offers a far richer PC standard.andM;PC computing's future is here, and it's called Windows 3.0.andM;A Work SessionandM;In Windows 3.0andM;The wonder of the Windows 3.0 environment is how easy and rewarding it makestasks that involve several applications.andM;To illustrate this, consider Bill Watkins, fictitious manager of a fictitiousinvestment portfolio known as the Redgate Fund.andP;  Bill needs to be able totrack the performance of the fund, communicate his results to his investors,and sell the fund's merits to new customers.andM;Working in Windows, Bill could use DynaComm to connect to the Dow Jones NewsRetrieval service to obtain historical stock prices and copy the prices tothe Windows clipboard (photo 1).andM;He could then paste the stock price data into Excel for inclusion in theportfolio tracking worksheet (photo 2).andP;  Then he could use Excel's graphingfunction to create a quick bar chart, and copy both the chart and the tabulardata into a Word for Windows document (photo 3).andM;Finally, he could incorporate a chart of the data into a Powerpointpresentation for new investors (photo 4).andM;Pretty impressive results for less than an hour's work.andP;  And if he wanted toget fancy, Bill could automate most of this process using the scriptlanguages and DDE facilities of these programs.andM;Can You Run Windows on a Laptop?andM;If you standardize on Windows 3.0 in the office, you'll also want to use iton the road.andP;  But can you run it on a portable PC?andM;To realize decent performance from Windows 3.0 on a laptop or a portable, youneed at least a 286 or 386 machine that runs no slower than 12 MHz, 1 to 2MBof RAM, and a hard disk.andP;  That eliminates most of the super-lightweight classof laptops.andM;Eighteen laptops and portables show up on Microsoft's list of 3.0-compatiblehardware.andP;  We tried Windows on three: the Toshiba 3200SX, the Toshiba 1600,and Compaq's LTE/286.andM;Windows runs like a dream on the powerful Toshiba 3200SX portable, but on acomputer that packs 1MB of RAM, a 40MB hard disk, and a gas plasma screen, itshould.andP;  You can use Windows 3.0 to its fullest on the Toshiba, and you canenjoy 3.0's snappy appearance, provided that you like crisp orange-and-blackscreen displays.andP;  On the minus side, traveling with this 17-pound belemoth ona regular basis might prove tedious.andM;The 7-pounds-lighter, 286-based Toshiba T1600 would seem a more sensiblechoice for the frequent traveler.andP;  You may find the T1600's EGA Screendisplay a detriment, however.andP;  It shimmers near the top and its dark bluebackgrounds render titles hard to read.andP;  If you must run Windows on aportable, your best bet is to use the lightweight Compaq LTE/286, weighing inat only 6.7 pounds.andP;  It performs admirably with Windows in standard mode, andWindows was easily readable on its CGA screen--an improvement over theToshiba T1600's display.andM;How to Upgrade to Windows 3.0andM;Now that the wait for Windows 3.0 is over, Microsoft and the vendors ofWindows applications want to get Windows 3.0 and Windows 3.0-compliantapplications into your hands.andM;Microsoft has announced an ambitious plan to supply upgrades for currentusers of any version of Windows, including the runtime versions shipped withmany Windows applications.andM;The cost of the upgrade is $50, plus $5.50 shipping and handling, a $93.50savings from Windows 3.0's suggested retail price of $149.andM;Microsoft will mail information about the upgrade offer toa ll registeredWindows users, and encourages Windows application developers to follow suit.andM;But you needn't wait for the mail to upgrade to 3.0 Microsoft has set up atoll-Free telephone number (which will be in operation through September 15)to take orders for upgrades and to distribute information on how you canupgrade your current Windows applications, from Microsoft and other Windowsapplications vendors.andP;  The number is (800) 323-3577.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
