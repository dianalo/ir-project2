Pleads No Contest</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Harris Corp. pleaded no contest Friday to acriminal charge it aided and abetted the filing of a falsestatement by a Filipino businessman convicted of defrauding theDefense Department.   The Melbourne, Fla.-based company agreed to pay $200,000 infines and $300,000 to settle civil claims against it by thegovernment arising from a longstanding investigation of fraudinvolving weapons sales to the Philippines.   The company entered the no-contest plea in U.S. District Courtin nearby Alexandria, Va. The action was annunced by the JusticeDepartment in Washington.   The conviction stems from a lengthy Justice Departmentinvestigation of fraud against the Defense Department, which loansmoney to countries to finance military sales.   Harris admitted that its Farinon Division agreed to falselyinflate to $3.38 million the value of a $2.4 million subcontract itobtained from businessman Raymond F. Moreno to sell electronicequipment to the Philippines military under the program, theJustice Department said.   Harris-Farinon agreed to kick back $1.03 million of the $3.38million to a Hong Kong shell corporation operated by Moreno in theguise of a marketing fee, the Justice Department said.   Moreno, who pleaded guilty in 1987 to defrauding the Pentagon,submitted inflated invoices to the Pentagon's Defense SecurityAssistance Agency that disguised the kickback arrangement, theJustice Department said.   Moreno paid a $30,000 fine plus $950,000 in civil and taxjudgments.   The Justice Department, meanwhile, disclosed in court papersfiled in Moreno's case that Harris' Digital Telephone Systemsdivision paid a $1 million kickback to Moreno on anothersubcontract. This transaction was not part of Moreno's false filingwith the Pentagon.</TEXT></DOC>
