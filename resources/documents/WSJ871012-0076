StevensStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/12/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP FREST CANDA JAPANMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)FOREIGN-EXCHANGE MARKETS (FRX)PRECIOUS METALS, STONES, GOLD, SILVER (PCS)COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD) </IN><TEXT>   After seven months of sounding like Chicken Little, some dollar doom-sayers insist that the U.S. currency really is about to fall, despite its relative stability for much of this year.    The dollar faces serious political and economic pressures, according to this view. In particular, this week's report on the August U.S. trade deficit could trigger a storm. By the end of the month, the dollar could tumble 6% against certain currencies, some traders say.    The reduced volatility this year is largely credited to agreements among the Group of Seven nations -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada. The nations agreed in February in Paris to try to halt the dollar's two-year decline, in which it lost between 30% and 50% of its value against other major trading currencies.    In connection with the Louvre accord, as the agreement is known, central banks of the Group of Seven led a market intervention effort in which an estimated $90 billion was spent to stabilize currency rates. The dollar since has stayed in a relatively narrow trading band roughly between 1.8 and 1.9 West German marks and between 140 and 150 Japanese yen.    &quot;We could see it break out (this) week or the week after,&quot; Larry Ryan, senior vice president and foreign exchange manager at European American Bank, New York, said.    The breakout may have begun last week with the dollar's 1.9% drop to 1.8103 marks and its 2.2% fall to 143.68 yen. As the dollar approached the southern border of its recent range, some traders sensed that the Group of Seven may be willing to let the U.S. currency trade lower.    The strongest signals came from Britain's finance minister, Nigel Lawson, who said the Group of Seven may lower its exchange rate bands in accordance with changing economic factors.    &quot;Even in the European Monetary System they have to realign rates occasionally,&quot; Francoise Soares-Kemp, treasury vice president at Credit Suisse in New York, said. She was referring to the exchange rate control mechanism used by eight European nations.    Incentives for supporting the dollar also may be waning among Group of Seven members, traders speculate. For West Germany and Japan, new central bank intervention to support the dollar would worsen their runaway money-supply growth.    This rapid money-supply growth is one result of the two nations' major role in the foreign exchange market interventions this year, as their central banks circulated a flood of their own currencies to buy billions of dollars in the interbank market. Citing inflation and money-supply concerns, the West German Bundesbank tightened its credit policy last week.    &quot;It doesn't make sense for West Germany to raise rates to control money-supply growth and then throw more money out through intervention,&quot; Paul Chertkow, economics director at Hoare Govett, a London-based unit of Security Pacific Corp., Los Angeles, said.    The reason the U.S. is expected to be reluctant to support the dollar is the continued wide trade deficit. Throughout much of the currency's decline from record highs in early 1985, the Reagan administration aggressively campaigned for a weaker dollar as a means of closing the trade gap. A weaker dollar tends to make imports more expensive and U.S. exports more competitive.    &quot;At the moment, we would need (the dollar) between 100 and 120 yen&quot; to substantially improve the trade balance, David Redding, vice president and money market economist at Bankers Trust Co., New York, said.    The White House also is encouraging a weaker dollar in another, though probably unintended, way. The perception of President Reagan as a lame duck, heightened by the apparent defeat of his attempt to place Judge Robert Bork on the Supreme Court, reminds some traders of the late 1970s, when a dollar slide was partly due to a loss of confidence in the Carter administration.    The Senate's all but certain rejection of the president's Supreme Court nominee, Mr. Chertkow said, is a sign that the White House probably won't be able to grapple with other issues such as the federal deficit -- which is yet another cloud on the dollar's horizon.    And with the approaching presidential election year, traders and economists have little hope that the U.S. has the &quot;fortitude&quot; to deal with the pressing economic issues.    In the next 12 months, Mr. Chertkow forecasts, the dollar will fall to 1.6 marks and 122 yen. The risk in the forecast, he says, &quot;is that it will happen much sooner.&quot;    Wednesday's Commerce Department report on U.S. merchandise trade in August may trigger the next phase in the dollar's decline. Economists generally expect a narrowing of the trade gap to $14.5 billion, from the record $16.5 billion in July. However, the trade deficit has grown so wide that a sharp improvement won't reverse the negative market sentiment.    Even if the gap narrows to $11 billion, says Ms. Soares-Kemp of Credit Suisse, &quot;just multiply by 12 and see what kind of a number you come up with.&quot;    Once the dollar's downward trend is restarted, dealers expect corporate selling and efforts to hedge exposures to add to the downward momentum. The absence of such corporate activity in the market is another reason why the dollar has remained stable most of the year, traders say.    &quot;They've decided to wait until they smell blood again,&quot; says Mr. Redding of Bankers Trust.    ---   Friday's Currency Activity   The dollar weakened amid growing worries about inflation and doubts that U.S. trade figures for August will show significant improvement.    In late New York trading Friday, the dollar stood at 1.8103 West German marks, down from 1.8152 Thursday, and at 143.68 Japanese yen, down from 144.33.    The dollar moved in a fairly wide band in a thin market Friday, managing to recover from the day's lows of around 1.8085 marks and 143.50 yen, traders said.    They said the market turned away from technical considerations to focus attention on the dollar's underlying economic fundamentals, which many found wanting.    The odds remain high that Japan soon will raise its discount rate to rein in inflationary pressures, traders said, while West Germany earlier this week moved to tighten its monetary policy. In addition, Bonn is planning to introduce a 10% withholding tax on interest income from investments and bank deposits, starting in 1989. That move, traders said, is one more reason to wonder if West Germany will cooperate with U.S. requests to stoke German domestic demand to help narrow the U.S. trade deficit.
