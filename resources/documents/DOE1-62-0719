<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-62-0719 </DOCNO><TEXT>A calorimeter, consisting of uranium plates and thin liquid ionizationchambers filled with tetramethylpentane (TMP) at room temperature, hasbeen tested using electrons between 10 and 70 GeV. The essential characteristicsof the liquid are discussed, including measurements of the free electronlifetime. Results on uniformity, linearity and energy resolution aredescribed and some information on the response to hadrons has been obtained.A single TMP box containing four electrodes and a TMP position detectorfor electromagnetic showers have also been tested.</TEXT></DOC>
