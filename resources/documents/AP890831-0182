Pretoria Supreme Court Judge C.F. Eloff said the CarletonvilleTown Council acted with ``improper motives'' when it resegregatedthe park last year.   In Johannesburg, the South African Council of Churches saidauthorities in Bonn are refusing to investigate charges that WestGerman firms are helping South Africa build submarines in violationof a U.N. arms embargo.   Also Thursday, publishers of South Africa's largest-sellingnewspaper were fined $800 for violating a security law by quoting abanned black activist.   The Sunday Times published an interview with Harry Gwala, asenior member of the African National Congress guerrilla movement,in December after his release from prison.   Lawyers said they will appeal the judgment from a magistrate whosaid the newspaper was negligent in failing to determine that Gwalais among people not allowed to quoted in South Africa.   In Carletonville, town council chairman Jacobus Nel told aPretoria Supreme Court that officials banned blacks from the parkbecause of complaints they were littering and urinating in public.   However, Eloff said: ``I find that the town council was notmotivated to make the decision on account of a nuisance of blackpeople.''   Three Carletonville businessmen filed the suit, saying theresegregation triggered a black consumer boycott.   The town 50 miles west of Johannesburg is one of several wherethe far-right Conservative Party has reinstituted strict segregationsince capturing control in municipal elections last year.   The Conservatives oppose all concessions to the 28-million blackmajority and say blacks should have political rights only in tribalhomelands.   Under South Africa's apartheid policy of race discrimination, itis legal to segregate public facilities, though many public placeshave been integrated in recent years.   Conservative party spokesman Arthur Kemp said Thursday's rulingwill be appealed because the council acted ``strictly within statutelaw.''   He said the National Party's position is ``vicious hypocrisy.''The Nationalists like to boast to foreign audiences that they aredismantling apartheid, while maintaining segregation to please whitevoters, he said.   The South African Council of Churches said in a statement thatreports by an Oslo-based monitoring group and Cologne's WDRtelevision provided details of three West German companiescollaborating in South Africa's submarine project.   ``Throughout the submarine saga, the German government has soughtto sweep the matter under the carpet,'' the church council said. Itnoted the Bonn government on Aug. 1 refused a request by the Kielprosecutor's office to investigate the Kiel ship-building companyHowaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft AG and the engineering firmIngenieurkontor Luebeck.   West Germany's Economics Ministry said there was no evidence thefirms' dealings with South Africa were illegal.   ``The government can only be cleared if it allows an intensiveinvestigation,'' the council said.   Vice Adm. Dries Putter, chief of South Africa's navy, said in astatement Thursday that the navy has ``postponed indefinitely''plans to build its own submarines. He said the navy has completed amajor modernization of one of its three French-built, Daphne classsubmarines and is busy upgrading a second.   South Africa customarily refuses to disclose details of militarycooperation with foreign countries.</TEXT></DOC>
