The FDIC, which in March pumped $1 billion into banks owned bythe ailing holding company, said it will infuse an additional $2billion to wipe out the company's negative net worth and expectseventually to have to pay out another $1 billion to cover bad loans.   NCNB has agreed to pay between $210 million and $240 million toacquire a 20 percent stake in what will be called NCNB TexasNational Bank. For five years, it will have an exclusive option topurchase the 80 percent of the bank which will be owned by the FDIC.   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said Texas billionaire H. RossPerot had promised to act as a standby to ensure that NCNB's shareof the investment is paid in time, but said he doubted that Perot'shelp would be needed.   The First RepublicBank deal rivals the 1984 rescue ofContinental Illinois Bank andamp; Trust Co. of Chicago, the largest bankbailout to date. In that case, the FDIC's initial outlay was $4.5billion, although it expects to recover all but $1.7 billion.   Seidman said the ultimate cost of the First RepublicBanktransaction ``is expected to be significantly lower'' than theinitial outlay, but said ``it is certainly possible'' the ultimatecost could be greater than the expected $1.7 billion cost of theContinental Illinois deal.   He said all of First RepublicBank's 41 subsidiary banks wouldremain open under their normal schedule, including those withSaturday hours. The banks will open under their new name on Monday.   ``No First RepublicBank depositor will lose a single cent,''said Comptroller of the Currency Robert Clarke.   Seidman said the transaction so far was an agreement inprinciple, and he said he expected it to be made final ``somewherein the next three months.''   Until then, the FDIC has taken control of the banks under abridge bank arrangement, a new legal device authorized by Congresslast year. It is being used for only the second time. NCNB willmanage the banks on the FDIC's behalf.   In order for the FDIC to take over First RepublicBank underbridge bank rules, the Comptroller of the Currency, the regulatorof nationally chartered banks, and Texas regulators had to firstdeclare the banks owned by the holding company insolvent.   This leaves owners of the holding company's $1.2 billion in debtand preferred stock with little chance of being repaid. However,the creditors of the subsidiary banks will be protected. Thecompany's bonds have been trading recently at below 20 cents on thedollar.   Seidman said ``it wouldn't surprise me if we see some lawsuits''from bond holders.   He said NCNB was chosen from among five bidders because itoffered ``the least costly alternative the FDIC believes wasviable.'' The next best bid would have cost the agency nearly $1billion more, he said.   Seidman declined to name the unsuccessful bidders. However,published reports have identified the four: Wells Fargo andamp; Co. ofSan Francisco, Citicorp of New York, an investment group eaded byFirst RepublicBank's management and another investment group headedby former Texas Sen. John Tower.   The FDIC, which gets its money through an assessment on thenation's 14,000 commercial banks and guarantees deposits up to$100,000, is having one of its worst years ever.   Last year, 184 banks failed, a post-Depression record, and equalnumber or slightly more are expected to fail this year.   All this is expected to cause the FDIC's insurance fund tosuffer its first loss this year. Seidman estimated the insurancefund will decline by 10 percent from its $18.3 billion balance atthe end of 1987.   ``Any time you have to spend $4 billion, it does give you pause.... But I believe this will be good for Texas and I believe it isappropriate from the stand point of the insurance fund,'' Seidmansaid.   First RepublicBank, the largest bank holding company in Texaswith $32.5 billion in assets, posted a net loss of $2.3 billion forthe first six months of 1988.   On June 30, it reported nonperforming assets, or loans thataren't being paid back, of $5.13 billion, more than 20 percent ofits total loans outstanding. Negative net worth in assets minusliabilities was about $1.1 billion.   The deal catapults NCNB, with $28.6 billion in assets, from 18thlargest bank in the nation to 10th largest, now with about $50billion in assets. It is an ambitious institution with a reputationas an aggressive commercial lender.   The FDIC board, comprised of Seidman, Clarke and a third boardmember, C.C. Hope, approved NCNB's offer late Friday afternoon, butthe agency did not announce the rescue until 10 p.m. EDT.   In the intervening time, the FDIC set off the complicated chainreaction necessary to declare First RepublicBank's subsidiariesinsolvent. It began with the FDIC's statement to the comptrollerthat it would not renew its $1 billion loan to the Dallas holdingcompany when it became due in September and ended with thecomptroller, an official of the Treasury Department, and Texasregulators declaring the 41 member banks insolvent and appointingthe FDIC as receiver.   First RepublicBank, under its current charter, was created inMay 1987 when stockholders and regulators approved the merger ofInterFirst Corp. and RepublicBank Corp., creating at the time thenation's 12th largest banking institution.   First RepublicaBank stock, which a year ago sold at above $26per share, dropped by 25 cents a share to 75 cents Friday intrading on the New York Stock Exchange.</TEXT></DOC>
