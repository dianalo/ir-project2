High-temperature incineration is also beginningto be used to decontaminate sites where hazardous chemicals were disposedof in the past with large amounts of heat usually wasted in such incinerators.This report presents a characterization of MSW incineration technologies,an energy market evaluation in the DADS area, an evaluation of energyrecovery from waste tires, a conceptual design of an integrated incinerationpower plant, and an economic analysis of hazardous waste processing costsand potential savings with an integrated facility. Analyses of the amountand types of hazardous wastes, appropriate incineration technologies,a process design to size flue gas heat recovery equipment, and cost estimatesfor hazardous waste incinerator systems and heat recovery equipment wereperformed by Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) ina companion study and used in this report. The primary conclusion ofthis study is that processing cost savings with an integrated waste incineratorpower plant range from 6 to 20% of costs compared to separate hazardouswaste incineration. However, this result depends on the amount and moisturecontent of the waste material and the electricity value sold to the localutility. Other results and conclusions include the types of hazardouswaste incineration technologies recommended, the market for energy products,and institutional restraints and requirements. 32 refs., 17 figs., 20tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
