President Bush, who praised Marine Lt. Col. Higgins publiclyduring the day as a ``symbol of courage,'' telephoned Mrs. Higginsto offer private condolences and tell her the United States isstill seeking full details on her husband.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Gen. Al Gray, thecommandant of the Marine Corps, had informed Higgins' wife of theresults of the FBI analysis of the videotape ``purported to be ofLt. Col. Higgins.''   ``Presidet Bush called Mrs. Higgins at about 2 p.m. to offer hissupport and encouragement. The president said the U.S. governmentwill continue to do all it can to obtain a full accounting of whathappened to her husband,'' Fitzwater said.   The FBI said its forensic experts have concluded ``within areasonable degree of medical certainty that the person depicted inthe videotape is dead.''   ``Although a positive identification could not be made, numerousobservable characteristics were noted indicating that the persondepicted in the videotape is Lt. Col. Higgins,'' the FBI said.   A law enforcement source, speaking on condition of anonymity,said FBI experts were unable to determine the time of Higgins'death from their examination of the videotape.   The tape showed a man, bound and gagged, hanging by a rope fromhis neck.   Higgins, head of a 75-member United Nations peacekeeping team,was kidnapped in south Lebanon on Feb. 17, 1988.   The president paid tribute to Higgins at a ceremony at Ft. Myerin nearby Arlington, Va., marking the 200th anniversary of theDepartment of War, forerunner to the Pentagon.   Bush used the occasion to press for his defense priorities,including mobile nuclear missiles, the B-2 bomber and the StrategicDefense Initiative, all threatened with budget cuts on Capitol Hill.   With the Defense Department's top civilian and military brassseated behind him, Bush offered a salute to ``every brave Americanwho ever served'' in peace and wartime.   Then, in a voice that broke, he added:   ``We cannot leave here today without pausing to salute one whostands as the symbol of the courage that burns in the breast ofevery American in uniform, one Marine who has been very much in ourthoughts, Lt. Col. Higgins, William Richard Higgins.''   Higgins' captors said they hanged him last Monday in retaliationfor the Israeli kidnapping of a Moslem cleric, Sheik Abdul KarimObeid. The terrorists had made previous death threats againstHiggins, calling him a spy.   Israeli government officials said their sources indicatedHiggins had been killed some time ago.   Fitzwater said now is a time of ``monitoring and watching'' atthe White House as the Bush administration pursues diplomaticefforts to free hostages in Lebanon. Eight additional Americans arebeing held, and a half-dozen other Westerners.   Fitzwater said Bush was ``cautiously optimistic,'' but expectsit will take ``a longer period of time rather than shorter.''   ``There are a lot of ideas being floated, a lot of exchangesbeing made. ... We see ideas coming out from Iran, from Syria,Algeria, Israel, the United States, everybody,'' said Fitzwater.   The pro-Iranian Revolutionary Justice Organization said Sundayit would release another American hostage, Joseph Cicippio, ifIsrael frees the Moslem cleric and hundreds of other Lebanese andPalestinian prisoners.   Fitzwater said of the White House refusal to comment on thatoffer: ``We have to be very careful of what we say. ... Often youcan cut off those kinds of channels and communications if youcomment prematurely in public.''   There is no change in the U.S. policy of refusing to negotiatewith terrorists, said Fitzwater.   ``We have always said our policy is to talk to anyone who hasinformation about our hostages, to discuss any possibility ofrelease, to pursue every avenue of knowledge and information thatmight lead to their release and that's what we're doing,'' he said.   Richard Boucher, a State Department spokesman, said the U.S.role ``remains one of active diplomacy.'' He added, ``We'recontinuing to be in contact with various parties in the region andwith international organizations.''</TEXT></DOC>
