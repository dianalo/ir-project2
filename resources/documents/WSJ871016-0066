But abandoning the strike didn't prove easy.    In a scene repeated across the country, striking players reported to their teams yesterday, and declared themselves prepared to play this Sunday. But management uniformly rejected the offers, according to owners' spokesmen, offering instead to provide practice facilities and per diem pay of $108 until Monday, when the players would be restored to active status.    For the past two weeks, management has set 1 p.m. Wednesday as the deadline for players to cross the picket lines and retain their eligibility for the coming week's games. &quot;Some of these players are woefully out of condition and there's a real risk of injury&quot; if they played on such short notice, said Jim Finks, president and general manager of the New Orleans Saints.    In a statement, the NFL Management Council's executive committee said that replacement teams would play again this weekend and that returning players -- those who accepted the offer of facilities until Monday -- were being prepared for the games of Oct. 25-26.    Most players promptly left camp after the offer to play was refused. Their departure &quot;was orchestrated by the union,&quot; Mr. Finks said. Management sources speculated that players were trying to claim they were locked out, which would buoy their legal claims and enable them to unilaterally declare free agency, a major sticking point in the contract talks.    Management representatives said there wasn't a lockout. &quot;We welcomed them with open arms,&quot; a spokesman for the management council said. Refusing to play or pay them this week was strictly a coaching decision, the spokesman insisted, saying the players needed more time to prepare physically and mentally.    Many of the players who walked out again indicated they would be back on Monday, when they would be restored to the rosters, said George Young, vice president and general manager of the New York Giants.    Union chief Gene Upshaw said that players filed a suit in federal court in Minneapolis yesterday, alleging that the owners of the league's 28 franchises have &quot;refused to deal fairly&quot; with the strikers and &quot;have abused their monopoly power to the extreme detriment of the players.&quot;    The NFL players thus became the second professional sports union to attempt to resolve its labor negotiations in court recently. Earlier this month, the National Basketball Association players union filed an antitrust suit against that league's owners, claiming that the team salary caps, right of first refusal in trades and college player drafts were an illegal restraint of trade.    The management council said it wouldn't comment on the lawsuit, because it hadn't read it yet.    The union's action came after a series of initiatives designed to resolve the impasses and reach a new collective bargaining agreement, or at least a return-to-work accord, failed. Negotiations for the latter collapsed after widespread reports Wednesday night that a deal was imminent.    The obstacles to that agreement apparently were management's resistance to the union's request for binding arbitration of unresolved issues and the question of how long the league would continue to operate under the expired 1982 contract.    Management wanted the old pact extended to next June, or until a new agreement was reached. The union insisted that it expire Feb. 1, the same date individual player contracts expire. &quot;If that happened, half the league would be free agents and we'd be in chaos,&quot; Mr. Finks said. &quot;It would open up a Pandora's box.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
