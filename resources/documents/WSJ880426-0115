The company said it retained the investment banking firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. as its adviser.    As previously reported, Los Angeles-based Vista Group Ltd., which describes itself as a mergers and acquisition concern, announced in February that it and Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. had made a $16-a-share &quot;firm offer&quot; for Superior. Prudential-Bache Securities, a unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of America, promptly denied that it had authorized such a buy-out offer and said it would cease to have any relationship with Vista.    However, Prudential-Bache did acknowledge at the time that it had sent a letter to Superior in January, saying that it was representing Vista and was interested in discussing the possibility of arranging a leveraged buy-out transaction, although no price was mentioned.    A Superior spokesman declined to say whether Prudential-Bache is engaged in the latest discussions, but he did say that Vista isn't involved. </TEXT></DOC>
