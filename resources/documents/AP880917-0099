(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL's bankruptcy trustee says he isconsidering two new bids for the ministry's assets this weekend ashe prepares to recommend a buyer to a federal bankruptcy judge.   ``I hope we can finish it up by Monday,'' Trustee M.C. ``Red''Benton said Friday night.   In a separate development, ministry officials said they weresuspending some service programs at the troubled ministry,including a home for unwed mothers-to-be, to save money.   Benton said one new bidder is a Toronto, Ontario, businessman,but he refused to reveal his name. Another bid came from a group ofprivate investors from the New York and Washington areas, Bentonsaid.   The Charlotte (N.C.) Observer quoted unidentified sources assaying the private investors offered about $200 million, $50million in cash.   The Canadian man, the newspaper reported, wants an option on theassets until Dec. 31. If he then bought the property, he would pay$115 million including $50 million in cash.   Benton said if he could not make a recommendation on a buyer toBankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds by Monday, he would request anotherdeadline extension to accept more bids. Reynolds has given Bentonuntil Sept. 27 to choose a buyer or liquidate PTL's assets.   Peter Thomas, the Vancouver, British Columbia, businessman whohad previously offered $113 million, remains a possible buyer,Benton said, adding, ``I think Peter Thomas is still right inthere.''   PTL has been in bankruptcy proceedings since June 1987, threemonths after founder Jim Bakker left amid a sex-and-money scandal.Reynolds has said that if PTL and its large Christian theme parknear here aren't sold by Oct. 1, he will order the ministry closed.   Earlier this month, Benton described Bakker as the leadingbidder for the property, but the proposed deal apparently fellthrough when Bakker couldn't prove he had the financing to reclaimhis ministry.   Benton and Don Edwards, interim president of Heritage MinistriesInc., said Heritage Ministries officials have suspended theoperations of their home for unwed mothers, adoption service andhome for homeless or drug-addicted men.   The suspension will save the ministry $3,000 a day in operatingcosts, said Edwards. The minstry had found homes for the two girlsstill living at the unwed mothers facility and were looking forplaces to send the men.</TEXT></DOC>
