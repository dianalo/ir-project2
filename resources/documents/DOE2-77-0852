Constant displacement rate and constant load testswere conducted at approximately 1000 C. These tests were interruptedat various times to examine crack morphology changes with temperatureand time- dependent effects on fiber-bridging of cracks. Cracks werefound to open in a time-dependent fashion by fiber pullout prior to eventualfailure. This behavior was modeled by a time-dependent interfacial slipcaused by a glassy layer at the fiber/matrix interface. 5 references.</TEXT></DOC>
