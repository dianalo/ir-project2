The growing efforts are designed primarily to motivatestudents who aren't headed for college. They range frompaying more attention to high school grade transcripts topromising jobs to students who demonstrate competence incourses that teach skills employers need.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We have got a pretty good system for moving from schoolto college, but we don't have a good transition from schoolto work,&quot; says Bill Honig, California's Superintendent ofPublic Instruction. In contrast to colleges, employers rarelylook at the records of high school graduates going directlyinto the work force. For these students, &quot;there's no reasonto work hard,&quot; Mr. Honig says.   As a result, many employers complain they have a hard timefinding enough workers with adequate skills for entry-leveljobs that require the use of computers, writing or elementarymath. Jere Jacobs, an assistant vice president at PacificTelesis Group, says that only 40% of the 6,500 annualapplicants for entry-level jobs such as telephone operatorscan pass &quot;an employment test pegged to the junior highlevel.&quot;   The new school/business programs are aimed at changingthat. In Fort Worth, Texas, Superintendent of Schools DonRoberts has established a business-dominated task force tolook at entry-level job requirements at such companies asGeneral Dynamics Corp., Tandy Corp., Pier 1 Imports Inc.,American Airlines Inc. and the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.&quot;What do secretaries in your organization do?&quot; Mr. Robertswants to know. &quot;What level of word processing, math andreading do they need?&quot; Then the schools will review theircourses to make sure they're teaching the required skills.   Mr. Roberts hopes that business will respond to the schoolsystem's curricular review by promising jobs to students whoacquire the necessary skills. He also hopes that firms willprovide summer jobs and apprenticeship programs to rewardyounger students who do well in school.   California is trying to launch a number of pilot projectswith similar goals. &quot;We want to be able to tell kids, `If youachieve this level of performance, you'll get this kind ofjob,'&quot; Mr. Honig says.   The efforts to link grades and jobs were triggered by JohnBishop, a professor at the School of Industrial and LaborRelations at Cornell University. He observed that studentswho aren't headed for college have little incentive to studyhard because businesses rarely look at their school records.&quot;The labor market fails to reward effort and achievement inhigh school&quot; with higher pay or better jobs, he wrote in anarticle in Educational Researcher.   Last year, Mr. Bishop's writing began to attract wideattention in school circles. Mr. Honig in California, AlbertShanker, the president of American Federation of Teachers,and Scott Thomson, who was then executive director of theNational Association of Secondary School Principals, allbegan echoing his theme that businesses were missingopportunities to spur school performance.   Another professor, James Rosenbaum of NorthwesternUniversity, noted that one of the reasons Japanese studentswork harder than Americans is that Japanese schools workclosely with businesses. The Japanese send the best studentsto the best jobs, he said, whereas &quot;Americans are suspiciousof linkages between public schools and employers.&quot; Of thehigh school graduates in Japan who don't attend college,almost all start working immediately after graduation, whilefewer than half the American students not headed for collegehave jobs by the time they graduate.   U.S. business groups are getting the message. The AmericanBusiness Conference has started to work on incentive programsin California and elsewhere. &quot;We're trying to develop asystem where business will start communicating to studentsearly on, perhaps in seventh or eighth grade, that if they'reexceptional students and meet the requirements, we're goingto reward them,&quot; says Peggy Murray, the director of ABC'seducation task force.   Working with ABC and the National Alliance of Business,the Educational Testing Service has begun to develop aproject, called Worklink, to maintain computerized school,test and work records that businesses could check when theyhire. Schools in Tampa, Fla., and business leaders inSpokane, Wash., are looking at the program, which proponentsargue would give students incentives to boost their gradesand establish uniform rating standards.   High school transcripts often are hard to understandbecause course descriptions and grading patterns differwidely. In addition, transcripts don't tell employers whatthey want to know about work habits, reliability and socialskills.   Schools are beginning to change that. In Colville, Wash.,a town of 5,000 northeast of Spokane, transcripts report onattendance, punctuality, ability to work in groups,willingness to do more than the minimum required and otherfactors. California is looking at ways to include similarinformation in its transcripts.   Any moves to make transcripts more useful -- both asincentives to students and information for employers -- willhelp students find better jobs. Currently, &quot;one of thesaddest consequences of the lack of signals of achievement inhigh school is that employers with good jobs offeringtraining and job security are unwilling to take the risk ofhiring a recent high school graduate,&quot; Mr. Bishop says.</TEXT></DOC>
