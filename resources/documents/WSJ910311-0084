Nguyen Khac Vien, the country's best-known historian andeditor of the Vietnam Courier, said that without a radicaloverhaul of leadership Vietnam &quot;will step into years ofdarkness.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   In a letter to the chairman of the Vietnam FatherlandFront, an umbrella organization for trade unions and otherassociations, Mr. Vien, himself a member of the Front, sayspeople outside the party and low-level party members have&quot;lost all faith&quot; in the Politburo and other leading partyorgans. He urged the forthcoming Seventh Communist PartyCongress to &quot;return all authority to popularly elected organsand the state.&quot;   Mr. Vien's letter is the most recent example of criticismof the Communist Party from its own ranks. It comes asVietnam faces changes in the world political order that haveforced it to reconsider its dealings with Moscow, China andthe U.S.   Moscow, Hanoi's longstanding ally, not only is veeringfrom the socialist path but also can no longer afford tobankroll such nations as Vietnam. But China, with whichVietnam fought a border war a decade ago, is sticking to itssocialist guns and is making tantalizing offers of help.Meanwhile, the Western world, led by the U.S., is danglingthe promise of economic help if Vietnam accepts a deal inCambodia that could profoundly alter Vietnam's security and,perhaps, ideology.   In principle, the National Assembly, elected by popularvote from candidates nominated by the Vietnam FatherlandFront, appoints a council of ministers to run the nation. Butin reality, the party makes and administers policy.   Vietnamese authorities haven't responded publicly to Mr.Vien's letter, which is circulating in the Vietnamesecommunity in France. Mr. Vien charges that each partysecretary in the provinces, districts and villages is &quot;awarlord&quot; who decides everything from economic to culturalmatters. This is the first time such views have been aired bya veteran communist who is still in Vietnam.   Mr. Vien says capitalist nations shouldn't be put down as&quot;bourgeois democracies&quot; but viewed as popular democraciesbecause they gained freedoms through two centuries of popularstruggles. He condemns the party for refusing to allowfreedom of the press, freedom of thought and freedom ofassociation.   Late last year, Bui Tin, an army colonel and deputy editorof the party daily newspaper Nhan Dan, in a &quot;citizen'spetition,&quot; said Vietnam should set aside the old socialistgoals and concentrate on developing the nation. The partythen expelled him for violating discipline, and he has beenaccused in a secret party circular of personal and politicalfailings. Mr. Tin has remained in France since issuing hisletter in Paris, where he was on an official mission.</TEXT></DOC>
