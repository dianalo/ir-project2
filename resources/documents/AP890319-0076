Guns are dangerous, law enforcement is suffering because ofthese guns,'' DEA administrator John Lawn said on the CBS-TVprogram, ``Face the Nation.''   ``I am asking them to (take this action), on behalf of theofficers who are in danger every single day, because a policeofficer dies every 57 hours in this country,'' said Lawn.   But Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and the new drug czar,William Bennett, said they did not think the government should callfor private manufacturers to stop retail sales of semiautomaticweapons.   Colt announced that it was suspending sales of its AR-15semiautomatic rifle starting last Thursday, the day after PresidentBush decided to ban temporarily the import of foreign-made assaultrifles.   Bennett and Thornburgh called for debate on whether the federalgovernment should ban all nonmilitary sales of semiautomatic weaponsor urge private companies to voluntarily suspend sales.   ``As an official of the federal government, I don't want to speakin such ways that suggest that I'm pushing them in any direction oranother,'' Bennett said on the NBC-TV program, Meet the Press.   But he added: ``I think we can make the case that we don't need awhole lot more assault rifles on our streets right now.''   Bennett and Thornburgh said a comprehensive solution was needed.   ``If we think that the only way to deal with the drug problem isto ban a particular type of weapon, we're dead wrong,'' Thornburghsaid on the ABC-TV program, ``This Week with David Brinkley.''   Wayne LaPierre, a spokesman for the National Rifle Association,said he opposed any ban on assault weapons and advocated stiffmandatory jail sentences for anyone convicted of using a weapon inthe commission of a crime.   Addressing the issue of drug use in nation's capital, Bennettsaid he had not yet decided whether to declare the federal districta ``high intensity drug trafficking area,'' enabling him to assemblea government strike force to fight drug dealing in Washington.   As of Sunday, 118 murders had been reported in Washington so farthis year, a record rate, and police say that nearly all aredrug-related.   The Washington Post, quoting unidentified Bennett aides, reportedin its Sunday editions that the strike force would target repeatdrug offenders, try to shut down the city's 90 open-air drugmarkets, and use abandoned military facilities as temporary prisonsfor drug offenders.   ``We did not declare Washington a high-intensity drug-traffickingarea,'' said Bennett. ``We are looking at whether we should do thator not.''   Bennett said, ``Several mayors wrote to us and said, `We, too,want to be high-intensity drug trafficking areas.'   ``People need to be careful before they seek that designation,''said Bennett. ``This is not a good thing to be. Maybe someadditional federal assistance will be available once thisdesignation occurs, but in many ways, it's an admission that thecity has failed to conduct its business in a way that can keep it'sstreets safe for the citizenry.''   Bennett, asked whether he was bothered by allegations thatWashington Mayor Marion Barry was involved with cocaine, replied,``Well, sure it troubles me. I think it troubles everybody.   ``If you've got all these allegations going around, it hurts thecredibility of Washington. But I don't think we have to be so daintyas to say, `Well, if we have disagreements or problems with themayor, we're going to ignore the city.''   Barry was asked on ABC whether he used drugs.   ``Absolutely not,'' he said. But he brushed aside persistentquestions about whether he would resign, saying, ``The issue is notMarion Barry.''   Thornburgh declined to discuss allegations against Barry, saying``those are all matters that are under investigation by the UnitedStates Attorney's office in Washington and, obviously, I'm not goingto comment on them.''   Barry urged federal authorities to use force against LatinAmerican nations that produce illegal drugs.   ``The national government needs to go to these five or sixcountries in South and Central America, send the Army, the Navy, theAir Force, the Coast Guard _ burn up those fields, eradicate thosecoco leaves ... blow up those labs, stop it at the source,'' Barrysaid.   After the broadcast, Barry told reporters that if a federalstrike force is sent to Washington, ``I wonder what they are goingto do.''   ``If he (Bennett) thinks these murders are going to be curbed bymore federal police, then more power to him,'' Barry said.</TEXT></DOC>
