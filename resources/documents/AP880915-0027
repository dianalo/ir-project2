(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An Army officer formerly responsible forprocuring guns for his unit was charged Wednesday with stealing 201rifles, shotguns and handguns, according to a federal indictmentmen.   Maj. Michael Lynn Smith, 42, stole weapons worth $60,000 between1981 and 1983, apparently for his gun collection, said U.S.Attorney Joe Brown.   The weapons include .44 Magnum revolvers, .22-caliber rifles,9-millimeter pistols, 20-gauge shotguns, Remington bolt-actionrifles and various rifles with scopes, Brown said.   Smith is chief of the family support division at Fort Campbell,on the Kentucky border near Clarksville.   He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted on the five-countindictment handed down by a federal grand jury.   The indictment accuses Smith of stealing the guns during his1981-84 tour of duty as an adjutant to the Intelligence SupportActivity, a Virginia military support unit.   Smith allegedly made out false vouchers for the money spent onfirearms and kept those not delivered to the unit. Brown said thestatute of limitations has run out on charging Smith withsubmitting false documents.   Brown said Smith agreed to report to U.S. marshals in Nashvillethis week.
