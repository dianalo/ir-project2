But spokesman Alfonso Sanchez Gallo said: ``First they wouldhave to find an appropriate place and then they would have to getthe funds. The bar owners themselves would have to pay for it.''   Sanchez said prostitutes were meeting with government officialsto discuss the opening of a red light district.   Last week authorities in Chihuahua City, the state capital,closed about 31 downtown bars and restaurants they said had becomefronts for prostitution.   They said the businesses will stay shut despite prostitutes'threats to strip in protest in front of the capitol building.   About 1,500 prostitutes threatened to march on the capitolMonday and undress publicly to press for creation of a red lightdistrict in the city.   ``There was no march and nobody took off their clothes,''Sanchez said in a telephone interview.   He quoted Chihuahua Gov. Fernando Baeza as saying that any baror restaurant catering to prostitution would have its licenserevoked.   The Mexico City newspaper Excelsior on Sunday quoted MagdalenaAguirre, a spokewoman for the prostitutes, as saying she and theother prostitutes would exhibit themselves ``completely naked'' atthe capitol if their demands were not met.   Ms. Aguirre ridiculed Baeza's suggestion that prostitutes seekfactory jobs, according to the Sunday edition of the Mexico Citydaily La Jornada.   She was quoted as saying that factories ``only pay 60,000 pesos($23) a week. We make that much or more in two hours.''   Sanchez said Baeza had warned the women that it would be illegalfor them to disrobe in public.   ``The state government has to put the brakes on prostitution. Itisn't legal here,'' the spokesman added.   Sanchez then mentioned a possible ``tolerance zone.''   Although prostitution is illegal in Mexico, many city and stategovernments have allowed red light districts to operate.</TEXT></DOC>
