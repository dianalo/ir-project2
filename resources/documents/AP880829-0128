The EPA is legally required to move against Los Angeles becausean eight-month moratorium on pollution penalties expires atmidnight Tuesday. Congress imposed the moratorium last December togive itself more time to revise and clarify the Clean Air Act.   But negotiations over revising the law are stalled bydisagreements over acid rain and other issues, and legislators holdout little hope of resolving the impasse before Congress adjournssometime in October for election campaigning.   The EPA's construction ban applies only to facilities thatannually produce more than 100 tons of carbon monoxide or volatilecompounds like gasoline that form ozone, a major component of smogwhich causes lung damage.   Oil refineries, paint shops at auto assembly plants or largeprinting plants might emit that much ozone-causing pollution, butnone is planned in the Los Angeles area.   A representative of state air pollution officers said the EPA'saction was little more than ``a paper tiger.'' California officialJames Lents said it would have no immediate impact on his state,whose regulations already forbid construction of facilitiesemitting more than a few tons of pollutants annually.   But Lents, executive officer of California's South Coast AirQuality Management District, said it might be harder to buildneeded sewage treatment plants if the ban continues for very long.   In announcing the ban, EPA Administrator Lee M. Thomas renewedhis appeal for Congress to provide guidance on dealing with the 107cities or other areas that failed to meet federal air qualitystandards last year for ozone, carbon monoxide or both. The 107areas cover about one-third of the U.S. population.   Thomas said if Congress fails to act again this year, the resultcould be ``many more sanctions on areas as well as mandatoryfederal pollution plans and litigation, which will only furtherdelay reaching the goal we all want _ clean air.''   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm ofCongress, says existing law is not silent on the issue, as Thomascontends, and that all 107 areas should be penalized.   Decisions on similar construction bans are pending for VenturaCounty, Calif., and for the Indiana and Illinois suburbs of Chicago.   Before the end of the year, the EPA expects to adopt a policyrequiring areas not meeting pollution standards to demonstratesteady progress, with a goal of an average 3 percent reduction inpollution concentrations annually, apart from any nationwidereductions.   When it adopts that policy, the agency will decide whether toimpose construction bans at Denver, Reno, Nev.; Bakersfield,Sacramento and Fresno, Calif.; East St. Louis, Ill., the Indianasuburbs of Louisville, Ky.; Cleveland, Atlanta and Dallas.   The agency said Dallas could escape penalties because of newproposals in its latest air quality plan.   Denver, Reno and Cleveland fail to meet carbon monoxidestandards. Fresno fails both the carbon monoxide and ozonestandards, and the other areas fall short of meeting ozonestandards.   Because of its weather and terrain, Los Angeles has by far thehighest ozone concentrations in the country. Anti-pollutionmeasures there have long been the strictest in the country.   The Los Angeles construction ban already has been ordered by thecourts as a result of a successful environmentalist lawsuit lastJanuary, although the ban was held in abeyance during theenforcement moratorium voted by Congress.   States may lose federal highway and sewer funds and airpollution grants for areas that fail to carry out approved airquality plans. The EPA interprets existing law as requiringconstruction bans in an area whose plans _ like that for LosAngeles _ fail to show how standards would be met by last Dec. 31.   ``The construction ban in the past, aside from a few places inCalifornia, has been a paper tiger,'' said William S. Becker,executive director of the State and Territorial Air PollutionProgram Administrators who said withholding highway aid is moreeffective.   ``It just seems ludicrous that they are sanctioning the areathat has done the most, and I think EPA recognizes this,'' Beckersaid.   Lents, however, said the EPA's action came as no surprise and``there is no reason for us to get upset.''   Lents said his district expects to adopt in December a new plancalling for 126 new control measures based on existing technologythat will ``set a framework for meeting the standards in 20 years.''   All clean-air proposals being studied by Congress would extendcompliance deadlines by up to 16 years.</TEXT></DOC>
