Amani said the recently completed offensive by 10,000 governmenttroops captured the city of Khushgumbad, 20 miles east of Jalalabad.``Our victory is very crucial because we have an important airportat Khushgumbad.''   The city of 30,000 was considered a guerrilla stronghold.   The eastern city of Jalalabad was the guerrillas' first majortarget after Soviet troops completed their withdrawal Feb. 15 fromAfghanistan. The rebels predicted a quick victory, but a stalemateoccurred soon after the battle began three months ago.   ``We are no more just defending positions, we are now on theoffensive,'' Amani said. ``The areas are not only under our control,but we are setting up permanent military posts.''   President Najib has called on the United States and Pakistan,which support the guerrillas, to press for a negotiated settlementto the war, which Najib says the guerrillas are incapable ofwinning. The insurgents control much of Afghanistan's countrysidebut have been unable to take major cities.   The state-run Bakhtar news ageny said 229 guerrillas were killedand 150 wounded in the offensive. It said 86 rocket launchers and18,200 machine-gun cartridges were captured. The report did notmention government casualties.   It was not immediately possible to verify the government's claims.   An Asian diplomat, who monitors military developments inAfghanistan, said such a victory would be a major blow to theinsurgents.   ``Jalalabad was the prestige battle, and if the government is nowsaying it is pushing the rebels further east it is a big blow to theinsurgents,'' said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</TEXT></DOC>
