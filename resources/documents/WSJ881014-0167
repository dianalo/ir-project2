The surplus increased both on a year-to-year basis and, after seasonal adjustment, from the prior month, the first time in 17 months that combination has occurred.    It increased 4.3% in September from the year before, to $7.74 billion from $7.42 billion, the Finance Ministry said. Exports gained 13.6%, to $23.12 billion, while imports rose 18.9%, to $15.38 billion.    After seasonal adjustment, the surplus stood at $6.08 billion in September, up 10.1% from $5.52 billion in August. Adjusted exports fell 1.2% from the prior month, to $22.16 billion, while adjusted imports declined 4.9%, to $16.08 billion.    At the same time, the unadjusted surplus with the U.S. ran against the broader trend, falling 4.3%, to $4.65 billion from $4.86 billion in September 1987. U.S. exports to Japan, bolstered by strong shipments of raw materials, food products and machinery, rose 26.2%, to $3.45 billion. U.S. imports of Japanese goods, meanwhile, rose only 6.6%, to $8.10 billion.    The improvement in the bilateral trade balance was ignored by the currency market, which kept with prior practice by focusing instead on the latest trade data from Washington. The Commerce Department reported yesterday that the overall U.S. trade deficit widened to $12.18 billion in August from a revised $9.47 billion in July, and the dollar fell sharply.    Until July, Japan's trade surplus had declined from the year before for 15 consecutive months, a result of the strong yen and economic policies designed to promote imports and redirect export-oriented production toward the domestic market. The policies were successful, but in recent months exports have been unexpectedly strong. The surplus rose in July, but then turned downward again in August.    Much of the increase in the September surplus was attributable to a decline of almost 30% in imports of oil and oil products in September. The decline stemmed from the drop in oil prices and the Aug. 1 increase in Japan's excise tax on oil, which prompted stockpiling before the increase. David Gerstenhaber, senior economist with Morgan Stanley International Ltd., said that a tally of imports excluding oil and gold showed underlying growth of 31.3% on a year-to-year basis.    Many analysts believe further improvement in Japan's trade imbalance will be difficult to achieve. For one thing, the rate of increase in import volume has been slowing since June. In September, import volume rose 12.9%, a significant increase but well below June's 20.5% growth.    Kenneth Courtis, strategist and senior economist with DB Capital Markets Ltd., said the decline in the trade surplus has stalled because of three factors: the increase earlier this year in the value of the dollar; the temporary decline in the Japanese economy in the second quarter and the increasing export competitiveness of Japanese companies.    Elizabeth Saccente, senior economist with Citicorp Vickers Scrimgeour, said she has been &quot;expecting some slowdown in {Japanese economic} growth for later this year.&quot;    Still, many imports showed solid growth in September. For instance, Japan's overseas purchases of food products jumped 28.8%, to $2.52 billion, while machinery imports gained 24.7%, to $2.06 billion.    On the other hand, exports have been showing solid growth in recent months, although Mr. Gerstenhaber of Morgan Stanley said September's 13.6% growth rate was the second-lowest since November 1987. Mr. Courtis of DB Capital Markets said the vigorous exports are a tribute to Japanese companies' ability to adapt to the high yen. Compared with 1984, the peak of Japan's export boom, there is now 68% more value added to each unit of Japanese exports, he said. This is demonstrated, for example, by the increased focus of Japanese auto makers on exporting luxury cars, as opposed to economy models.    Some of September's strongest export gains came in shipments of machinery, up 26.1% to $4.84 billion, and electrical equipment, up 18.9% to $5.67 billion. Automobile exports rose 4%, to $4.2 billion.    Japan's overall trade surplus in the first six months of the fiscal year that began April 1 totaled $37.69 billion, down 5.9% from $40.06 billion a year earlier. </TEXT></DOC>
