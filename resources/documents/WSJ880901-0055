Lloyd Bentsen is just going to be there.&quot;    About as important to the game, it would seem, as the caddy.    But Mr. Bentsen, courtly as a chairman of the board, clearly intends to be something more. In a separate interview, the patrician, silver-haired senator displays a steely combativeness. He talks of leading B-24 bomber squadrons over Europe in World War II -- and, by implication, draws a contrast with a brash vice presidential opponent embroiled in questions over his military service, academic record and personal life.    &quot;You know where the courage was?&quot; Sen. Bentsen asks. &quot;It was in the quiet guys. The guys full of braggadocio -- that wasn't where the courage was.&quot;    The two vice presidential candidates are proud and different men. Each hails from a state where politics transcends mere partisanship to become a blood sport. Yet they are separated by temperament, self-image and, ultimately, the conflicting political strategies they are executing.    They are, of course, secondary factors in the unfolding presidential campaign. At best, a running mate can carry a key state or two, as Lyndon Johnson carried Texas for John Kennedy in 1960, or reassure voters already drawn to the top of the ticket. At worst, a vice presidential candidate can cost the few precious percentage points that decide a tight election.    Yet the choice of a running mate says a good deal about the judgment of the presidential candidate and the strategic outlines of his campaign. Michael Dukakis and George Bush intend to use Lloyd Bentsen and Dan Quayle in quite different ways.    Sen. Quayle's mission is to ignore Sen. Bentsen and attack Mr. Dukakis as a far-out liberal. &quot;Fix bayonets!&quot; summarizes Quayle adviser Ken Khachigian, a former Ronald Reagan speechwriter. &quot;We aren't going to be distracted by the Bentsen rabbit.&quot;    Sen. Bentsen's prime missions are to carry his native state and to reassure conservative Democrats nationally that Mr. Dukakis is a level-headed manager. But he won't be ignoring Sen. Quayle. Dukakis strategists think there are votes to be won by portraying the Indiana Republican as a lightweight and a hard-right ideologue.    &quot;George Bush devalued the vice presidency when he chose Dan Quayle,&quot; argues Kirk O'Donnell, a top Dukakis adviser. &quot;And Quayle's record is a real liability. Opposition to raising the minimum wage, opposition to the plant closing {law}, votes against child-health legislation. We're talking about a real right-wing voting record here.&quot;    Yesterday, Dukakis campaign manager Susan Estrich predicted that &quot;Dan Quayle is going to emerge not only as an issue, but as a liability on the Republican side&quot; because the Quayle issue &quot;goes to judgment and it goes to leadership.&quot; Sen. Quayle, campaigning in Louisiana, responded: &quot;This is the first real sign that you are seeing a crumbling campaign.&quot;    Sen. Bentsen, a better campaigner than expected, has been a bright spot in a Dukakis campaign that has lost momentum recently. Sen. Quayle seems to have weathered his early campaign crisis and, barring some new bombshell revelation, is ready to move from being on the defense to taking the offense.    The two campaigns are a study in contrasts, as are the campaigners themselves.    Sen. Quayle, who has vaulted from near-unknown to household name in just two weeks, campaigns in a maelstrom of jostling reporters, shoulder-held TV cameras and reaching microphone booms. Loud placards alternately taunt him (&quot;War Wimp&quot;), and urge him on (&quot;We Trust You Dan&quot;). His demeanor remains upbeat, even defiant. When a press technician asks him to autograph a critical Newsweek cover, he writes four words: &quot;Great Pick, Dan Quayle.&quot;    Hammer, hammer, hammer: That's the sound of the emerging Quayle campaign. Here in Billings, he hits Gov. Dukakis as a gun-control advocate who is &quot;far outside the Western mainstream.&quot; Quayle advisers, loaded for bear, travel with thick notebooks compiling Dukakis statements and positions on every manner of subject. The notebook on the Democrat's defense views is entitled, &quot;Toward a Weaker America.&quot;    In contrast, Sen. Bentsen campaigned last week in a half-empty plane, to a measured cadence. He portrays Gov. Dukakis as a pragmatic, can-do executive. And he offers himself -- a business-oriented Senate Finance Committee chairman and former insurance executive -- as evidence of that moderation. The recurring words of his speeches are the words of the boardroom: &quot;Competence,&quot; &quot;hands-on management,&quot; &quot;enhanced recovery.&quot;    &quot;Michael Dukakis is right for the South. Take it from a Texan,&quot; he assures the Southern Legislative Conference. Courting Democrats who deserted their party for Ronald Reagan, he exhorts a roomful of blue-collar workers near Detroit: &quot;Come on home! We're ready for you.&quot;    But in every speech, he also jabs at Sen. Quayle, his ideology and even his qualifications for high office. He reminds audiences that Sen. Quayle &quot;fought tooth and toenail&quot; with conservatives struggling to delete plant-closing legislation from the new trade bill. The legislation, which ultimately passed and got the reluctant signature of President Reagan, requires many employers to give their workers 60 days advance notice of plant closings. Who led the fight for that bill, Sen. Bentsen asks: &quot;You're looking at him.&quot;    The Texas senator, who is 67, suggests that his 41-year-old opponent is both inexperienced and unready for White House responsibilities. &quot;I certainly don't think he's too young. But you have to have some maturity, whatever age you happen to be,&quot; he says at one press conference. Sen. Quayle defends a relatively sparse congressional record by arguing that he has done as much as a senator named John Kennedy, who also was criticized as inexperienced when he sought higher office.    Still, Mr. Quayle, in an interview, says even he was a little surprised when Mr. Bush tapped him as his running mate. When his phone beeper went off, he says, &quot;My first thought was that {Bush campaign chairman James} Baker was calling the losers, the also-rans.&quot;    The Indiana senator, like Mr. Bentsen, is not only a millionaire many times over, but also a supremely self-confident man. Put the two candidates on the stump, however, and their confidence comes out in quite different ways.    There is a rakish, bantering quality in Sen. Quayle, even when he is running the campaign gantlet. (&quot;Get out of town,&quot; a letter to the editor greeted him in Sioux Falls, S.D., last week.) He epitomizes the modern, telegenic, coat-over-the-shoulder candidate. His speeches are crisp, and he can poke fun at himself.    He told a Lexington, Ky., audience about the time he was introduced as a &quot;great, great, great American.&quot; Driving home that night, he said, he asked his wife, Marilyn, how many great, great, great Americans she thought there were.    &quot;One less than you think, buddy boy,&quot; he says she replied.    He can also be a slashing, attack-dog campaigner. He defeated an eight-term Democratic congressman in 1976, then ousted three-term Democratic Sen. Birch Bayh four years later.    Sen. Bentsen is instinctively less partisan, more formal and more senatorial. He sniffs with surprise at the nasty things John Tower, a former GOP Senator from Texas, has been saying about him lately. &quot;I can't believe he meant me,&quot; Sen. Bentsen says in an interview. &quot;We served together in the Senate.&quot;    Yet he can be partisan when he has to be. A case in point: His initial Senate campaign of 1970.    In the Democratic primary, he beat incumbent Democratic Sen. Ralph Yarborough, a liberal populist who was a thorn in the side of the dominant conservative wing of the Texas Democratic Party. Sen. Yarborough had endorsed both a Vietnam War moratorium and 1968 presidential candidate Eugene McCarthy. Bentsen television ads showed graphic scenes of rioting at the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago. The ads said the riots were &quot;spawned by supporters of Eugene McCarthy.&quot;    Sen. Bentsen says he approved the contentious ads &quot;in the heat of battle.&quot; But, jabbing a finger at his interviewer's chest, he adds heatedly that Mr. Yarborough picked the fight by attacking Bentsen family business practices in the Rio Grande Valley. &quot;He started it. You bet! And I responded,&quot; he says.    In the general election, Mr. Bentsen beat George Bush, who then was a moderate GOP congressman. &quot;Part of our campaign strategy was to make Bush more liberal,&quot; says George Christian, a longtime Bentsen friend and political adviser.    Mr. Bush made that easier by missing a high-profile chance to vote against gun control; he was playing paddleball in the House gym at the time. The Bentsen campaign dubbed him &quot;Gymnasium George&quot; and won fairly easily.    Now, as the presidential campaign accelerates, Sens. Bentsen and Quayle find themselves executing reverse-image strategies.    Sen. Bentsen portrays Mr. Dukakis as a pragmatist, Sen. Quayle flails him as a liberal ideologue. Sen. Bentsen emphasizes low-key economic issues: trade, the budget deficit, the plight of the depressed oil patch. Sen. Quayle hits high-voltage emotional issues: crime, defense spending, gun control. Looking ahead to a probable televised vice presidential debate, Bentsen strategists worry that the stumbling start of the Quayle campaign could rebound against them: Public expectations of Sen. Quayle may be so low that he has nowhere to go but up.    Although Sen. Bentsen will campaign nationally, his preoccupation must be Texas. (He is also running for Senate re-election there this year.) And even in Texas, says adviser George Christian, the presidential campaign will need help from Mr. Dukakis -- something dramatic, something akin to the way Catholic John Kennedy confronted Texas Protestant ministers in 1960.    &quot;Some of the Republican charges have stuck to Dukakis,&quot; worries Mr. Christian. &quot;Bentsen has such credibility that he can deflect a lot of that. But it would be a mistake to think he or anyone else can defend Dukakis alone. Bentsen sets the table for Dukakis in Texas. But Dukakis has to serve up some food.&quot;    With his own home state of Indiana solidly Republican, Sen. Quayle is more free to campaign nationally. To counter the &quot;lightweight&quot; charge, advisers say he will start working more substance into his speeches. But every speech will also rip Mr. Dukakis.    &quot;Quayle brings something to the ticket that Bentsen does not, an ability to fire up the troops,&quot; maintains campaign adviser Khachigian.    Some Quayle strategists -- street-smart Stuart Spencer among them -- discern a silver lining even in the disastrous first week of their man's campaign. Argues Mr. Spencer: &quot;It gave us $20 million worth of free publicity.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
