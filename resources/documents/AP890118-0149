The Dec. 29 directive of the Soviet Council of Ministers orderedsome cooperatives to close by Feb. 1.   ``Up to now, not one co-op has closed because of the decision,and I do not know of any that show any inclination of ceasing theiractivity,'' said Vladimir Yakovlev, chairman of the FAKT marketresearch and consulting cooperative.   ``If the co-ops are closed, the state will have to pay back alllosses due to the decision. I think that the people who decided toclose the cooperatives did not calculate concretely how much itwould cost the government,'' he told a news conference.   The directive ordered medical and publishing coops to close, aswell as video salons, which provide snacks and tea to viewers whowatch films.   It costs between $48,000 and $80,000 to start a video salon inMoscow, he said.   The cost of starting a medical co-op is considerably higher.Medical co-ops and video salons make up only about 6 percent of thecooperatives in Moscow, but the government would be forced to payout a ``significant'' amount of money to buy them out, Yakovlev said.   The directive was based on emotion rather than economics, and byenforcing it the government would contradict its own reform effort,Yakovlev said.   Video salons were doing a booming business when the governmentdecided to restrict them, he said, implying that if demand countsfor little, economic reform is doomed.   ``If the decision of the ministers becomes law, the cooperativemovement will not be able to continue,'' Yakovlev said.   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has encouraged development of thecooperative movement in all spheres, although citizens themselvescertainly would agree to restrictions regarding ventures that pose arisk to the public.   ``The decision is a most unpleasant fact in the history of thecooperative movement,'' he said.   Government bureaucrats as well as the general public know littleabout the economics of the cooperative movement, he said.   ``A great deal is said about the negative attitude of thepopulation toward coops. The basis of this attitude is the people'slack of comprehension of the laws of economics. According to ourstatistics, only one out of 10 persons understands how prices aredetermined in a free market, and I think the decision shows thatsame lack of comprehension in the ministries and stateorganizations.''   Cooperatives have no way to influence events, Yakovlev said. Totry to remedy their lack of clout, three major co-op associations,each with between 1,000 and 2,500 co-op members, plan to organize aunion through which owners hope to be able to elect delegates tolegislative bodies.</TEXT></DOC>
