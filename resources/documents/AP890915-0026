STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PASSAU, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hundreds of East German refugees havedriven into this country in a cloud of pollution from their tiny,exhaust-belching cars.   The East German Trabants have two cylinders and run on a mixtureof gasoline and oil.   The cars do not meet West Germany's strict emission control laws,and the environmental Green party says one should be put in a museumwith a sign: ``Forest Killer'' and the rest sent to the scrap heap.   West German transportation officials have been issuing specialpermits to allow the East Germans to drive the ricketyplastic-and-fiberglass cars.   But the Greens object to a plan by the federal Transport Ministryto give wholesale exemptions to the new drivers.   Instead, they say the government should hand out annual federalrailway passes, worth about $4,000 each, in exchange for theTrabants.   ``We're going to have to come up with some imaginative solutionsto this problem,'' said Erhard Jauck, a spokesman for the BavarianInterior Ministry. East Germans typically wait more than 11 yearsfor a Trabant and more than 14 years for the larger Wartburg sedanssome refugees drive.   But after they become established in West Germany, most refugeesprobably will get rid of their cars.   Some will do so for reasons other than pollution, however.   West Berlin is surrounded by East German territory, and many ofthe refugees who want to settle in the city are reluctant to drivetheir car _ which still carry East German license plates _ 70 milesacross their homeland to reach West Berlin.</TEXT></DOC>
