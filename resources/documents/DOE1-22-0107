<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-22-0107 </DOCNO><TEXT>Measurements of phonon dispersion relations of aluminium along the highsymmetry directions were performed by coherent inelastic scattering ofthermal neutrons technique. All measurements were taken at room temperatureusing the IPEN triple axis neutorn spectrometer. The results obtainedwith accuracy are in good agreement with the published data. The dispersionrelations were calculated theoretically within the framework of Born-vonKarman and Axially Symmetric models, including interactions up to thefifth nearest shell of atoms. The elastic constants were determined usingthe values of sound propagating velocity obtained directly from the dispersionrelations along of high symmetry directions of the crystal. Applyingtheoretical models the force constants of aluminium were also determined.From these data several physical properties of the metal can be obtained.</TEXT></DOC>
