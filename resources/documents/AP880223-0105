U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein said Monday he sentencedJoseph Armone to prison despite his age because he was convincedthe defendant was a high-ranking member of the crime family.   Weinstein also cited Armone's lengthy criminal record, which hesaid began when the defendant was 15 years old.   Armone, of Brooklyn, was convicted Dec. 22 of racketeeringconspiracy involving extortion, bribery and illegal interstatetravel to commit bribery.   He was jailed after his conviction when he refused to renounceany organized crime ties, a condition for his release fromdetention.   He had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years for the most seriouscharge, racketeering.   One of the bribery charges accused Armone and a co-defendant,Joseph N. Gallo, of plotting to give a $20,000 bribe so thatGallo's son would be transferred from a state prison to a federalprison, where presumably he would receive better treatment. Theplot was unsuccessful.   Gallo, 76, the reputed former consigliere of the Gambino family,was sentenced earlier this month to 10 years in prison and fined$300,000 for his racketeering conviction. Weinstein stayed thesentence pending appeal.   Two other co-defendants were also sentenced Monday. AnthonyVitta, 49, of Queens, a reputed Gambino soldier, was given a10-year prison sentence and fined $250,000. Vitta was convicted ofracketeering conspiracy, loansharking and other charges.   Salvatore Migliorisi, 49, of Brooklyn, was sentenced to threeyears in jail and fined $25,000 for his extortion and obstructionof justice conviction.   The four defendants were among 16 people with alleged ties tothe Gambino family who were indicted in June 1986.   Of the 16 defendants, 11 have now been convicted or have pleadedguilty, two were acquitted, charges against one defendant weredismissed, another defendant is missing and believed dead, and oneis awaiting trial.   Armone faces additional federal charges of extortion andracketeering in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., where he and 12 other peoplewith alleged ties to the Gambino family were named last month in a22-count indictment.</TEXT></DOC>
