The system uses single-phase flowthrough the magnet and two-phase return-flow cooling through the outerwall. Measured transient temperatures are reported for pulsed operationat design conditions. Measured cryogenic and electrical transients ofthe system are reported for the quench of a single magnet.</TEXT></DOC>
