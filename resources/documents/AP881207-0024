Daniel Lashof, a scientist in the Environmental ProtectionAgency's office of policy analysis, reported on studies of effectsneglected in most computerized climate models at a conferenceTuesday organized by the Climate Institute.   The Institute, a non-profit body supported by government,foundation and corporate grants, tries to call attention to issuesaffecting the climate such as the greenhouse effect, or the expectedwarming of the Earth caused by the accumulation in the atmosphere ofgases that trap heat that normally would escape into space.   The most important of these gases is carbon dioxide formed in theburning of fossil fuels.   Such a warming could cause sea levels to rise and flood coastalareas and lead to stronger hurricanes, drastic shifts in rainfall,the northward migration of agricultural zones and more frequentdroughts.   A widely used prediction is for an eventual warming of between2.7 degrees Fahrenheit and 8.1 degrees sometime in the middle of thenext century.   Lashof used a computer model that yielded a prediction of 2.7degrees to 9.9 degrees before he incorporated additional``biogeochemical'' processes that increased warming might stimulate.The central prediction from this model was for a warming of 6.3degrees.   The augmented model yielded a central prediction for 17.5-degreewarming, 11.2 degrees more than the original model. The range wasfrom 4 degrees to what Lashof called ``unknown territory'' where hedeclined to report a prediction.   Three ``quite speculative'' processes accounted for 85 percent ofthe 11.2-degree increase in Lashof's central prediction:   _The release of large quantities of methane, also a heat-trappinggas, from warming arctic tundra.   _Decreased reflection of sunshine back into space from changes inthe vegetative cover of the Earth.   _A sharp decline in the oceans' ability to absorb carbon dioxide.   Other minor processes included such effects as increase methaneemissions from rice paddies and swamps as temperature rises, morefossil fuel use to generate electricity to meet higher demand forair conditioning, changes in ocean currents and changes in oceanchemistry.   One of the additional effects Lashof studied would slow, ratherthan speed, the warming trend. He described it as enhanced growth ofvegetation resulting from more atmospheric carbon dioxide. Thiswould evaporate more moisture and cool the atmosphere slightly, hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
