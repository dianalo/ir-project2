SAS, which last month announced its intention to buy 12 of McDonnell Douglas's MD-11 planes for $1.51 billion, last week received &quot;a pricewise and otherwise quite aggressive&quot; new offer from Airbus for A-340s, according to Ulf Abrahamsson, SAS vice president for fleet planning.    In Long Beach, Calif., a spokesman for McDonnell Douglas's aircraft division said the company regards SAS's commitment &quot;as firm and unequivocal.&quot; He declined to comment on Airbus's move.    The Airbus proposal, which expires March 31, offers the long-range, four-engine A-340 in two versions, with the more powerful V2500 SuperFan engine, and for a better price, Mr. Abrahamsson said. &quot;It would be foolish not to consider this new input,&quot; he said.    The SAS letter of intent signed with St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas calls for a &quot;standard down payment&quot; to ensure delivery of 12 MD-11 tri-jets between 1991 and 1994, the SAS executive said. A purchase agreement was to be signed at the end of March, after the airline's directors approved it and technical specifications were worked out. SAS is partly owned by the governments of Sweden, Denmark and Norway.    Airbus, a European consortium of French, West German, British and Spanish aircraft companies, confirmed yesterday that it made a counteroffer to SAS. A spokeswoman in Toulouse, France, declined to comment on whether Airbus is making similar offers to other airlines ordering the MD-11. </TEXT></DOC>
