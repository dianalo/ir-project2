Analytic work on the stability of ideal orbits in the quadrupolewiggler with axial guide field has been carried out. An NRL code whichwas developed to examine helical dipole wiggler amplifiers is modifiedto treat both a helical quadrupole wiggler and the resulting relativisticorbit equations. Earlier work which examined the effects of near-axisself-fields on the stability of betatron oscillations and linear gainis extended to include waveguide modes, electron orbits far off aixs,axial guide field and the 3-D nonlinear gain to saturation. The numericalsimulation of nonlinear gain for the TE/sub 21/ mode without wigglertaper yields moderate efficiency (5%), high gain (66 dB) and broad bandwidth(50%) at 300 GHz with an annular beam.</TEXT></DOC>
