The National Weather Service said Hugo, the most powerful stormto hit the region this decade, slammed into the eastern tip ofPuerto Rico and skirted the northern coast before roaring to thewest-northwest toward the Bahamas.   Hugo also threatens the Dominican Republic, which shares theisland of Hispaniola with Haiti, and civil defense authorities inthe Dominican Republic before dark Monday declared a state ofemergency.   Eastern Airlines spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak in Miami said thecarrier flew a special Boeing 727 charter to the Dominican resort ofPuerto Plata Monday and returned to Miami with about 135 vacationers.   The storm's winds overturned cars and stripped roofs off housesand office buildings and sent chunks of concrete plunging intostreets in San Juan, where one-third of the U.S. commonwealth's 3.3million people live. Fifty airplanes were reported destroyed at theairport in Isla Verde.   There was widespread damage in San Juan's Condado Beach area, thesite of many of the island's large tourist hotels. Shattered glass,strips of roofing and overturned trees littered the streets, and fewdrivers ventured out in their vehicles.   Hugo cut power and disrupted international communications to theisland.   One woman in a San Juan high-rise told radio station WOSO ofwatching sections of the city darken as the first high winds andheavy rains hit San Juan. Widespread power outages also werereported in the Dominican Republic.   There were no immediate reports of casualties in Puerto Ricoalthough one man was electrocuted while trying to remove atelevision antenna as he prepared for the storm Sunday.   Bands of people, mostly youths, looted storm-damaged shops in SanJuan and police patrols were reinforced at the main Post Office,political party offices and shopping areas.   In a boutique on the ground floor of the two-story buildinghousing The Associated Press bureau in San Juan, young lootersdefied winds hitting 100mph at the peak of the storm and carried outarmloads of women's clothing.   The storm blew out the windows in the AP office on a peninsulabetween the sea and San Juan harbor, destroying its computers andoffice equipment. One staffer said his furniture was blown out thewindows of his apartment on the 20th story of his building.   At 6 p.m. EDT, Hugo's center was latitude 19.5 degrees north andlongitude 67.0 west, or 90 miles northwest of San Juan, said theNational Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla. It said Hugo wasmoving 13 mph in a wobbly, west-northwest to northwest direction.   Maximum sustained winds declined slightly over the day, to 115mph, and hurricane-force winds extended up to 75 miles from itscenter, the forecasters added.   Meteorologist Jesse Moore at the National Hurricane Center saidit was too early to tell whether Hugo would strike the U.S.mainland. He said the storm was expected to be off southeasternBahamas by Wednesday and ``after that, it's anybody's guess.''   Five people were reported killed, 80 injured and more than 10,000homeless Sunday on the French island of Guadeloupe, relief officialssaid. Two people were killed in Antigua, according to Beacon Radioin Anguilla, and there were reports of six deaths in Montserrat.   Richard Weening of Milwaukee, Wis., chairman of CaribbeanCommunications Co., which operates the GEM Radio Network from itsheadquarters on Montserrat, said ham operators linked to the networksaid the storm killed six people on the British Island and damaged95 percent of the homes and the hospital.   Nearly all of Montserrat's 12,000 residents were homeless andwithout food or fresh water, said ham radio operator Stuart Haimesof Queens, N.Y.   Off St. Thomas, charter boat captain O.B. O'Brian told Miami TVstation WTVJ that many boats and homes had been damaged. ``I'd saythe island is pretty well devastated,'' he said.   Most of the Virgin Islands' 106,000 residents live on St. Thomasand St. Croix. On St. Croix, a ham radio operator said the windstore off the roofs from up to 75 percent of the homes.   Officials said stores in the St. Croix town of Christiansted wereheavily damaged, and there were reports of looting. National GuardAdjutant Gen. Robert Moorehead said 1,000 people were evacuated torescue shelters in St. Croix.   Storm watches were in effect for parts of the Dominican Republic,and a hurricane warning was issued for the southern Bahamas,including the Turks and Caicos islands.   The weather service said winds ripped the roof off a baseballstadium on Vieques, an island with 7,000 residents 10 miles east ofPuerto Rico.   Bernard Sternberg, a Sunrise, Fla., ham radio operator, said hetalked to a radio operator who was on a boat in the eye of thehurricane as it passed over Vieques. ``He asked us to pray for himand we did,'' Sternberg said. ``We prayed for all of them.''   High winds Sunday blew roofs off six houses in the offshoreisland of Culebra. San Juan's Luis Munoz Marin InternationalAirport, by far the region's biggest, was closed, as were schools,banks, courts and government offices.   Navy Lt. Cmdr. Steve Burnett, spokesman for the Atlantic Fleet inNorfolk, Va., reported ``some damage to buildings and housing'' atRoosevelt Roads Naval Station on Puerto Rico's northeastern coast.``At this point, we don't know the extent of the damage,'' he said.   Burnett said all Navy ships that had been operating in the areamoved north over the last 48 hours.   Residents of hilly areas where flash floods are a danger wereurged to evacuate, and Social Services Secretary Carmen Sonia Zayassaid 11,300 people were moved from flood-prone coastal areas torescue shelters.   The Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico were last hit by a majorhurricane in 1956, when Betsy caused extensive damage and killed 11people in Puerto Rico.   Hugo is the fourth hurricane of the Atlantic hurricane season andis the most powerful hurricane to hit the region since HurricaneDavid in 1979. That storm killed an estimated 1,200 people in theCaribbean and Florida.   In Paris, the French Defense Ministry assigned 3,000 soldiers,two military transport aircraft and four cargo vessels to assist inrestoring communications and emergency services to Guadeloupe.</TEXT></DOC>
