In addition to the petitioner, the only remaining producer of steelrails in the United States is CFandamp;I Steel Corporation. In compliancewith the filing requirements of andSection; 355.26 of the Commerce Regulations(19 CFR 355.26), the petition alleges that manufacturers, producers, orexporters of steel rails in Canada receive subsidies within the meaningof section 701 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act).Since Canada is a ``country under the Agreement'' within the meaning ofsection 701(b) of the Act, Title VII of the Act applies to this investigation,and the ITC is required to determine whether imports of the subject merchandisefrom Canada materially injure, or threaten material injury to, the U.S.industry.Petitioner has alleged that it has standing to file the petition. Specifically,petitioner has alleged that it is an interested party as defined undersection 771(9)(C) of the Act and that it has filed the petition on behalfof the U.S. industry manufacturing the products that are subject to thisinvestigation. If any interested party as described under paragraphs (C),(D), (E) or (F) of section 771(9) of the Act wishes to register supportof or opposition to this petition, please file written notification withthe Commerce official cited in the ``For Further Information Contact''section of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Initiation of Investigation</ITAG>Under section 702(c) of the Act, we must make the determination on whetherto intiate a countervailing duty proceeding within 20 days after a petitionis filed. Section 702(b) of the Act requires the Department to initiatea countervailing duty proceeding whenever an interested party files a petition,on behalf of an industry, that (1) alleges the elements necessary for theimposition of a duty under section 701(a), and (2) is accompanied by informationreasonably available to the petitioner supporting the allegations. We haveexamined the petition on steel rails from Canada and have found that formost of the programs alleged the petition meets these requirements. Therefore,we are initiating a countervailing duty investigation to determine whetherCanadian manufacturers, producers, or exporters of steel rails, as describedin the ``Scope of Investigation'' section of this notice, receive subsidies.However, we are not initiating an investigation for certain programs becausethe petition failed to allege the elements necessary for the impositionof a duty or in some instances failed to provide the necessary supportinginformation. If our investigation proceeds normally, we will make our preliminarydetermination on or before December 20, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigation</ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the U.S. tariff schedules will be fully converted to this HarmonizedTariff Schedule (HTS) and all merchandise entered or withdrawn from warehousefor consumption on or after this date will be classified solely accordingto the appropriate HTS item number(s). Until that time, however, the Departmentwill be providing both the appropriate Tariff Schedules of the United StatesAnnotated (TSUSA) item number(s) and the appropriate HTS item number(s)with its product descriptions. As with the TSUSA, the HTS item numbersare provided for convenience and customs purposes. The written descriptionremains dispositive as to the scope of the product coverage.We are requesting petitioners to include the appropriate HTS item number(s)as well as the TSUSA item number(s) in all new petitions filed with theDepartment through the end of this year. A reference copy of the HTS scheduleis available for consultation in the Central Records Unit, Room B-099,U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington,DC 20230. Additionally, all Customs Offices have reference copies and petitionersmay contact the Import Specialist at their local Customs office to consultthe schedule.The product covered by this investigation is new steel rail, except lightrail, currently provided for under TSUSA Item numbers 610.2010, 601.2025,610.2100, 688.4280 and currently classifiable under HTS item numbers 7302.10.1020,7302.10.1040, 7302.10.5000, and 8548.00.0000.Steel rail, whether of carbon, high carbon, alloy or other quality steel,includes but is not limited to, standard rails, all main line sections(over 60 pounds per yard), heat-treated or head-hardened (premium) rails,transit rails, contact rail (or ``third rail'') and crane rails. Railsare used by the railroad industry, by rapdi transit lines, by subways,in mines and in industrial applications.Specifically excluded from this investigation are light rails which are60 pounds or less per yard. Also excluded are relay rails which are usedrails taken up from a primary railroad track and relaid in a railroad yardor on a secondary track.<ITAG tagnum="84">Allegations of Bounties or Grants</ITAG>Petitioner lists a number of practices by the Government of Canada, andthe provincial governments of Ontario and Nova Scotia which allegedly confersubsidies on manufacturers, producers, or exporters of steel rails in Canada.We are initiating an investigation of the following programs:A. Federal Programs1. Income Tax Exemption for Sysco.2. Certain Investment Tax Credits.3. Regional Development Incentive Program and Industrial and Regional DevelopmentProgram.4. Loans Under the Enterprise Development Program.5. Defense Industry Productivity Program.6. Promotional Projects Program.7. Program for Export Market Development.8. Federal Expansion and Development/Northern Ontario.B. Joint Federal-Provincial Programs1. Equity Infusions, Grants, Loans and Loan Guarantees Provided to Sysco.2. Iron Ore Freight Subsidy to Algoma.3. Mineral Development Agreement Benefits to Algoma.4. General Development Agreements.5. Economic and Regional Development Agreements.C. Provincial Programs1. Ontario Development Corporation Export Support Loans, Other Loans andLoan Guarantees.2. Provision of Subsidized Electricity by Ontario Hydro to Algoma Steel.Although not specifically alleged by petitioner, we are also investigatingwhether the manufacturers, producers or exporters of steel rails in Canadareceive countervailable benefits under the following programs:1. Community-Based Industrial Adjustment Program Grants.2. Export Credit Financing.We are not initiating an investigation of the programs listed below. Section702(b) of the Act requires the Department to initiate a countervailingduty proceeding whenever an interested party files a petition, on behalfof an industry, that (1) alleges the elements necessary for the impositionof a duty under section 701(a), and (2) is accompanied by information reasoanblyavailable to the petitioner supporting the allegations. All the programslisted below were alleged to confer domestic subsidies. The elements whichmust be alleged for a domestic subsidy program are: (1) Specificity, (i.e.,the program is limited to a specific enterprise or industry or group ofenterprises or industries, and (2) provision of a benefit (i.e., a subsidypaid or bestowed directly or indirectly on the manufacturer, producer,or exporter of any class or kind of merchandise). For upstream subsidies,the initiation threshold is higher. Under section 701(e) of the Act, theDepartment must have reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that an upstreamsubsidy, as defined in section 771A of the Act, is being paid or bestowedupon the merchandise under investigation. For the programs listed below,the requirements of section 702(b) or 701(e) of the Act were not fulfilledin the petition.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Provision of Subsidized Electric Energy by Hydro-Quebec</ITAG>Petitioner alleges that an upstream subsidy is conferred upon Algoma inthe form of low-cost electric energy. Specifically, petitioner allegesthat Hydro-Quebec, a provincially-owned power company, is being subsidizedand that the subsidy passes through Algoma's supplier of electricity, OntarioHydro, to Algoma.The provisions of section 771A(a) of the Act define an upstream subsidyas:<ITAG tagnum="21">Any subsidy described in section 771(5)(B)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv)by the government of a country that_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Is paid or bestowed by that government with respect to a product(hereinafter referred to as an ``input product'') that is used in the manufactureor production in that country of merchandise which is the subject of acountervailing duty proceeding;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) In the judgment of the administering authority bestows a competitivebenefit on the merchandise; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Has a significant effect on the cost of manufacturing or producingthe merchandise.</ITAG>Petitioner maintains that Hydro-Quebec is primarily subsidized by reasonof a contract it has for the purchase of electricity from the provincialpower authority in Newfoundland. Assuming <T3>arguendo </T3>that electricity is an input as defined by the Act, petitionerhas not provided any evidence which indicates that the contract betweenHydro-Quebec and the Newfoundland power authority was not an arms-lengthcontract made in the ordinary course of business. On the contrary, theinformation submitted tends to show that although the provisions of thecontract may now favor Hydro-Quebec, at the time the contract was negotiatedit was considered a mutually beneficial contract negotiated and agreedto at arms-length. Thus, petitioner's primary allegation regarding thesubsidization of the input appears unsubstantiated.Moreover, with respect to the competitive benefit to Algoma of the subsidizedinput, the petitioner alleges it can be measured by the incentive ratesprovided to large volume users by Ontario Hydro. We are initiating an investigationon the alleged provision of subsidized electricity by Ontario Hydro. Consequently,the alleged subsidy provided by this program will be examined separately.Petitioner has not alleged or demonstrated any competitive benefit separatefrom the incentive rate structure.Finally, we note that the Department has previously determined that thegovernment of one political jurisdiction cannot subsidize production inanother political jurisdiction [<T3>See Initiation of Countervailing Duty Investigation of Carbon SteelWire Rod From Saudi Arabia, </T3>(50 FR 28231, 28232, July 11, 1985).]Although this determination was based on the language in section 303 ofthe Act, which defines a ``bounty or grant,'' section 771(5) of the Actstates that the term ``bounty or grant'' has the same meaning as the term``subsidy''.Based on the foregoing, we are not initiating on this upstream subsidyallegation because the petitioner has not provided reasonable grounds forthe Department to believe or suspect that an upstream subsidy has in factbeen paid or bestowed upon the production of steel rails in Canada.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. </ITAG><T3>Income Tax Exemption for Government-Owned Companies other than Sysco</T3>Petitioner alleges that the tax exemption for Crown Corporations is ``animportant benefit in connection with the provision of subsidized electricityor coal to Canadian steel companies, because the Canadian provincial powercompanies are state-owned Crown Corporations''. This statement raises theissue of whether an upstream subsidy is being provided to the producersof steel rail in Canada. However, petitioner has not made an upstream allegationregarding this program. Therefore, we are not initiating an investigationon the tax-exempt status of state-owned provincial power companies.With respect to the Cape Breton Development Corporation (Devco), a supplierof coal to Sysco, we note that despite its status as a Crown Corporation,the supporting information provided by the petitioner states that Devcois not tax-exempt. Therefore, we are not initiating an investigation ofthe alleged tax-exempt status of Devco.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Special Tax Subsidy to Algoma</ITAG>Petitioner alleges that a tax ruling with respect to a joint venture betweenAlgoma Steel and its parent company, Canadian Pacific Railroad, was exceptionaland not usually available under Canadian tax laws and constitutes <T3>prima facie </T3>preferential treatment countervailable under section701 of the Act. Information in the petition indicates that the tax rulingpermitted the financing of a seamless tube mill. Petitioner alleges that,although earmarked for the tube mill, the money generated from the taxruling in fact benefitted all of Algoma's investment programs, and in particular,permitted the modernization of its rail facilities.Petitioner, however, has not alleged how this tax ruling confers a domesticsubsidy. A specific allegation that this benefit is limited to a specificenterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries was not made.Furthermore, petitioner has not provided any information to indicate thatthe tax ruling was mandated by the government rather than a neutral interpretationof Canadian tax law. Therefore, we have no basis on which to initiate aninvestigation on this program.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Other Investment Tax Credits</ITAG>Petitioner alleges that a variety of investment tax credits provide a benefitto producers or exporters of steel rails in Canada. We are not initiatingan investigation on the following types of investment tax credits.andbullet; Tax credits for investment in ``qualified property''_we are initiatingan investigation on the tax credits given for investments in ``qualifiedproperty'' made in certain regions of Canada. Petitioner also argues, however,that we must make a determination of whether the basic tax credit rateof seven percent for investments in ``qualified property'' is limited tospecific industries on a <T3>de facto </T3>basis. We have previously determined that the seven percentcredit is not countervailable because it is not limited to a specific enterpriseor industry or group of enterprises or industries. [<T3>See Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain FreshAtlantic Groundfish from Canada</T3> (51 FR 10041, March 24, 1986) (<T3>Groundfish</T3>) and <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Oil Country TubularGoods from Canada </T3>(51 FR 15037, April 22, 1986) (OCTG).]<ITAG tagnum="54">Absent the provision of new evidence, or an allegation of changedcircumstances, we have no basis upon which to re-initiate an investigationof this type of investment tax credit.</ITAG>andbullet; Tax credits for research and development expenses_In <T3>OCTG, </T3>we determined that investment tax credits of 10 percentof research and development expenses (20 percent for small businesses)were not countervailable because they are not limited to a specific enterpriseor industry or group of enterprises or industries. Absent the provisionof new evidence, or an allegation of changed circumstances, we have nobasis upon which to re-initiate an investigation of this type of investmenttax credit.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Enterprise Development Program: Loan Guarantees and Grants</ITAG>Availability of loan guarantees and grants through the Enterprise DevelopmentProgram was investigated in <T3>Groundfish. </T3>We determined that the provision of loan guaranteesand grants under this program was not limited to a specific enterpriseor industry or group of enterprises or industries. Absent the provisionof new evidence, or an allegation of changed circumstances, we have nobasis upon which to re-initiate an investigation of the provision of loanguarantees and grants under this program.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Indirect Government Intervention</ITAG>Petitioner alleges that, in 1982/1983, the federal and Nova Scotia governmentsagreed to share the cost of stockpiling rails produced by Sysco until thetime they were needed by the purchaser, Canadian National Railroad (CNR),which is a Crown Corporation. However, petitioner has not made an allegationthat this alleged benefit is limited to a specific enterprise or industryor group of enterprises or industries.Petitioner also alleges that a recent agreement between Sysco and CNR,whereby CNR agreed to purchase 80 percent of its needs from Sysco, constitutesa countervailable subsidy benefiting a specific company. However, petitionerhas not provided any evidence to indicate that this was a government providedor mandated benefit. Nothing in the petition indicates that this contractwas not strictly commercial in nature and was not made at arms-length inthe normal course of business.<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Government Assistance to Algoma's Reduction in Force Program</ITAG>Petitioner alleges that the government has assisted Algoma in directinglaid-off workers towards retraining, relocation, alternate employment andother available programs and that this constitutes an assumption of costby the government. However, petitioner has not provided any evidence thatthe government has assumed a pre-existing or contractual obligation ofthe company. Therefore, the elements of an assumption of cost subsidy donot appear to be present.<ITAG tagnum="81">8. Cape Breton Development Corporation (Devco)</ITAG>Petitioner alleges that Devco, a Crown Corporation sells subsidized coalto Sysco. Petitioner alleges that the sale of subsidized coal to Syscoconstitutes, either the provision of a good at a preferential rate, anassumption of cost by the federal government or an upstream subsidy. Petitionerprovides evidence which indicates that Devco has incurred operating losses,and that it sells coal at below its cost. However, petitioner has not madeany allegation that the subsidy is limited to a specific enterprise orindustry or group of enterprises or industries. Furthermore, a sufficientupstream allegation has not been made by the petitioner in accordance withsection 771A of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="81">9. Other Mineral Development Agreements</ITAG>As discussed above, the purpose of these agreements is to provide geosciencedata, mining and mineral processing technology, and market and economicstudies to the mining sector. This raises the issue of whether an upstreamsubsidy is being provided to producers or exporters of steel rail in Canada.However, a sufficient upstream allegation in this regard has not been madeby the petitioner in accordance with section 771A of the Act. Petitioneralso alleges that benefits under MDAs constitute an assumption of costby the governments involved and the provision of goods at preferentialrates. However, petitioner has not provided any evidence that the governmentassumed a pre-existing or contractual obligation, or that the governmentis providing goods or services to some industries at a lower price thanto others. Therefore, we are not initiating an investigation of the MDAsexcept with respect to assistance under the MDAs provided to Algoma.<ITAG tagnum="84">Notification of ITC</ITAG>Section 702(d) of the Act requires us to notify the ITC of this action,and to provide it with the information we used to arrive at this determination.We will notify the ITC and make available to it all nonprivileged and nonproprietaryinformation in our files, provided it confirms that it will not disclosesuch information, either publicly or under administrative protective order,without the written consent of the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration.<ITAG tagnum="84">Preliminary Determination by ITC</ITAG>The ITC will determine by November 10, 1988, whether there is a reasonableindication that imports of steel rails from Canada materially injure, orthreaten material injury to, a U.S. industry. If its determination is negative,this investigation will terminate; otherwise, this investigation will continueaccording to the statutory procedures. This notice is published pursuantto section 702(c)(2) of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="6">Jan W.
