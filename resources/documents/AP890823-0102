(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The fire chief has banned nightly volleyballgames at the fire station because he says game injuries kept two menfrom work.   But the firefighters say the games boost morale and keep them fit.   ``It may look bad when people drive by, but volleyball helps toimprove athletic ability and coordination,'' said Paul Ostman, afire equipment operator and regular volleyball player.   ``It helps us have the agility to do other things on the job. Wewear an extra 30, 40 pounds of equipment. Volleyball helpsstrengthen muscles we need to move under those conditions.''   For decades, firefighters have played volleyball in the eveningduring 24-hour shifts when their regular duties were done and theywere on standby.   But Chief Larry Bushey ordered the ban after two firefighterssprained ankles in a game and missed work for a few days.   ``Our only intention is to keep our fire units in service,''Bushey said. ``I know they complain they can go out and get injuredat the fire scene. We have no control over that, but we do havecontrol over who gets injured playing volleyball.''   Other recreational equipment is provided at the fire halls, andthe city also will pay for health club memberships, Bushey said.   A union grievance on the issue was delivered to Kjell Rodne, citypersonnel director, on Tuesday, said Jim Lane, president of DuluthFirefighters Local 101.</TEXT></DOC>
