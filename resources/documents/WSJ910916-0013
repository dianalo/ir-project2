Frans Andriessen, the EC's representative at the meeting,said the discussion was &quot;friendly and substantial,&quot; but that&quot;problems continue to exist&quot; in the area of agriculturalsubsidies. &quot;It is of crucial importance for the Uruguay Roundthat this question be resolved,&quot; he said.</LP><TEXT>   Joining Mr. Andriessen were U.S. trade representativeCarla Hills, Japanese international trade minister EiichiNakao and his Canadian counterpart Michael Wilson. Theinformal quadrilateral talks held Friday and Saturday toreview trade issues usually take place every six months.   Ms. Hills echoed Mr. Andriessen's remarks, adding that theEC has to settle internal disputes on agriculture before GATTnations can take up the issue.   Ms. Hills, who has been meeting with European governmentministers over the past week, said she had been told that theEC isn't likely to discuss agriculture until &quot;later in thefall,&quot; probably mid-October. After that, she said, it wouldprobably take an additional four to six months to completethe Uruguay Round.   The Uruguay Round originally was targeted to end inDecember 1990, but disagreements over agricultural subsidiesled to a breakdown in the talks.</TEXT></DOC>
