The U.S.-Soviet agreement being signed this week covers only intermediate-range nuclear missiles on the Continent.    Strain already is building in West Germany, where the government is sharply divided over the missile issue and where polls show that the average German has been deeply influenced by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's &quot;charm offensive.&quot; The opposition Social Democrats are preparing legislation requesting the U.S. to negotiate away some of its remaining short-range missiles, nuclear bombs and artillery shells from German soil, in exchange for the removal of some of Moscow's tank-heavy conventional forces in Eastern Europe.    Ortwin Lowack, one of the conservative Christian Socialist Union's defense experts in the West German parliament, says such a move would be difficult to stop because it is fueled by the argument that the remaining missiles' range of less than 300 miles guarantees that most would explode on German soil if used in battle.    &quot;You may be sure it will be the worst discussion we have ever had in Germany,&quot; he says.    Any move by West Germany to abandon or bargain away the use of remaining nuclear weapons as a deterrent is likely to produce a seismic political reaction in neighboring France, where one official describes the maintenance of some land-based nuclear weapons as a position the French would never abandon. He says President Reagan's perceived inclination toward &quot;zero solutions&quot; makes the French worry that the idea of nuclear deterrence is being abandoned. &quot;It is the basic reason why we are uneasy,&quot; explains the official, who asked not to be named.    Unlike the West Germans, recent polls show the French public hasn't been moved much by the Gorbachev campaign. &quot;Since the mid 1980s, France has become the most anti-Soviet country in Western Europe,&quot; says Francois Heisbourg, a former French defense official who heads the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.    He argues that serious consideration of the removal of the remaining land-based U.S. nuclear weapons will lead to a second source of European angst -- the possibility that the U.S. will remove its 326,000 troops from Europe.    Without the protective cover of nuclear bombs and artillery, Mr. Heisbourg says, U.S. and other NATO forces in Germany would be more vulnerable to attack because, in a nuclear weapons-free environment, Warsaw Pact forces could mass huge armored columns for an assault.    There is considerable talk between Paris and Bonn about building a &quot;European Pillar&quot; of French and West German forces, including French nuclear forces, that would either operate outside NATO or trigger a major reorganization of the 39-year-old alliance in preparation for a shrunken U.S. role. (France is still a political member of NATO, but ended its military participation in the 1960s.)    Jean Francois-Poncet, a former French foreign minister and an architect of this idea, wrote in a recent article that implementing it would be tricky because it could &quot;provoke exactly what everyone fears: a reduction in American troops stationed in Europe.&quot;    A third source of political angst stems from what appears to be a new and more serious turn in the East-West conventional arms-control talks in Vienna. The most logical way to prepare for such negotiations would be to build up NATO's sagging conventional forces, but that doesn't seem to be in the cards. Mr. Heisbourg notes that defense budgets in the U.S. and Britain are shrinking, a trend he believes will continue for the next few years.    In West Germany, the country most vulnerable to conventional attack, a recent Ministry of Defense poll found that only 24% of those surveyed worry about a serious military threat from the East, the lowest level ever recorded.    &quot;We need modern conventional weaponry with high technology to reach the enemy in depth,&quot; says one German defense official, &quot;but I'm not sure we'll get the means for it from our parliament.&quot;    Though France is slightly increasing its defense spending, a French official who has studied the imbalances in conventional weapons wonders how the West will get the Soviet Union to make lopsided deals. &quot;I am skeptical because if you have no chips on the table, I don't see how you can play the game.&quot; Both officials asked not to be named.    Despite the angst, the official position, endorsed by all the Western leaders, is that the West must move into the brave and somewhat unsettling new world that is being created by the nuclear-missiles agreement.    The possibility that the U.S. Senate might refuse to ratify the treaty is even scarier, European officials say. &quot;It would be a disaster,&quot; says a French official. &quot;{U.S. nuclear missiles} would have no legitimacy here. It's the worst situation that we can imagine. That would provoke a major crisis within the alliance.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
