Trucking within the 12-country bloc still works mostly under asystem of licences allocated under quotas that are negotiatedbetween individual countries.   Only 10 percent of the EEC's truck drivers have the right tomove freely across borders. Currently the EEC has 13,477 licencesoutstanding, but the number will be increased by 25 percent thisyear and 40 percent next year, the EEC transportation ministersdecided.   The next steps toward complete liberalization have not yet beendecided. Germany, which chaired the meeting and holds the mosttruck licences, insisted on the need to harmonize simultaneouslyroad taxes and working conditions for truck drivers.   The present, fragmented system costs time and money. Estimationsof the cost of a fragmented European market, including roadtransport, range from 50 to 300 billion dollars a year.   The European Commission, which for years called for free roadtransport, claimed the present system acts as a barrier to trade,is used by some member states to reserve the bulk of their roadexports to their own national hauliers and discriminates againstsmaller countries, especially those on the periphery of theCommunity.   The Commission has figured that about one vehicle in threetraveling among EEC member states is traveling empty, making theroads more crowded and wasting time and energy.   ``Industry and commerce are paying more than they should totransport their goods and services to markets in other membercountries,'' the Commission says. ``These increased distributioncosts are reflected in the price of goods to the consumer.''</TEXT></DOC>
