An axiom of the package-design business is that the best way for a food producer to boost sales in the crowded supermarket environment is to spend a lot of money on research and design to develop a distinctive &quot;proprietary&quot; brand image -- something that stands out enough to attract attention and build a loyal following. But lately the profusion of delicatessen counters and other specialty shops within the supermarket has given rise to a contrary trend.    Jerry Kathman, partner at Libby Perszyx Kathman, a Cincinnati package-design firm, says that in these shops-within-a-store he has seen cases &quot;time and time again&quot; when a tiny, anonymous label outproduced traditional packaging. The reason, he says, is that &quot;research shows that to the consumer, the minimal package implies freshness. This is true even though it's exactly the same product, manufactured in exactly the same way.&quot;    He says one brand of corn chips tripled its sales by moving to a plain package with a small sticker. Similar results have been obtained, he says, with such deli items as sauerkraut and potato salad in unadorned tubs. And &quot;hot dogs packaged with a printed paper strap appear to the consumer to be fresher than those with the printing on the (clear plastic wrap) itself,&quot; says Mr. Kathman.    Obviously this poses a problem for package designers. &quot;I do find it ironic,&quot; says Mr. Kathman, &quot;when I have to recommend the use of less decoration on a package. We're in the business of decorating packages.&quot;    Seven Museums Putting   Collections on Disk   ART MUSEUMS grapple with how to design a videodisk and computer library of images from their collections.    The Museum Education Consortium, formed last year by seven major U.S. museums, envisions several programs aimed at both art researchers and the general public. Within a year it hopes to produce a prototype disk, which could hold 54,000 images. A 300-image pilot program is now being tested with museum-goers.    According to Project Director Susan Stedman, who is based at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, developing an index program that would allow teachers and researchers to find various pieces is relatively easy. &quot;Even if you're looking for everything painted between 1900 and 1910 that has an apple in it, that use of the technology is fairly well established,&quot; she says.    The more challenging problem, she says, is how videodisk and computer technology can be designed for the general public &quot;to help people learn to look at works of art and to motivate people to want to learn.&quot; Besides still and moving art images, the disks could include narration, music and movie film.    In the future, says Ms. Stedman, personal-computer users may be able to dial up a huge art collection and browse through it from home.    Ceiling Fan Is Made   Of Unlikely Parts   FIVE FISHING rods and two bicycle sprockets form the blades and hub of an unusual ceiling fan recently introduced by Casablanca Fan Co., City of Industry, Calif.    Alexander Ignon, who lives in Malibu, Calif., and describes himself as &quot;more of a writer and an itinerant actor than designer,&quot; says he has always admired the graceful shape and whiplike flexibility of the glass fiber fishing rod and had been trying to think of a novel use for it.    After toying with fishing-pole sculpture, Mr. Ignon hit upon the fan-blade idea, using a rod to hold a piece of silk fabric in tension. He's not sure what inspired the sprockets, but he took it all to Casablanca. The result is the Boca Raton fan, with gossamer blades seven feet in diameter.    And an Unlikely Place   For Fancy Architecture   SUBURBAN shopping strips are generally conceded to be a string of architectural nightmares. Now a prize-winning architect is seeking to bring good design to mall land with an elegant auto showroom.    The architect, Ulrich Franzen, has designed headquarters buildings for Philip Morris Inc. and Champion International. His most recent work, however, is a Rallye Motors' 58,000-square-foot luxury-auto emporium in Roslyn, N.Y. Among its features are a light fixture 56 feet in diameter and a second-story glass walkway connecting the showroom to the service area. Mr. Franzen says he hopes the project will help inspire &quot;a new and very different attitude toward the design of commercial establishments along the American highway.&quot;    He isn't the first well-known architect to take on the humble task of designing an auto showroom in recent months. Arquitectonica, the Miami firm, unveiled a Honda dealership in Roswell, Ga., last year. </TEXT></DOC>
