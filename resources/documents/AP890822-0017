Add cut flowers and floral arrangements for weddings, funerals,lovers, Aunt Sophie and sick friends and you have horticulture _ oneof the fastest developing sectors in U.S. agriculture.   Since 1982, says an Agriculture Department economist, thehorticulture industry has grown an average of 10 percent a year.   Preliminary figures for 1988 show that producers of horticulturalproducts had cash receipts totaling $6.9 billion, which was morethan 9 percent of the $72.4 billion received by farmers last yearfor all crops.   For example, according to USDA statistics, the $6.9 billion forflowers, shrubs, sod and other greenery exceed 1988 cash receiptsfor cotton, $4.7 billion, and tobacco, $2.04 billion, and wascreeping up on feed crops _ including corn _ $7.68 billion.   Doyle Johnson of the department's Economic Research Service saidthe industry was in two sectors. Floriculture includes cut flowers,potted flowering plants, bedding plants and cut cultivated greenssuch as ferns used in arrangements.   The other is environmental horticulture, which includes all othernursery and greenhouse products.   Johnson's analysis of the rapid growth of the horticultureindustry is in the September issue of Farmline magazine.   ``One of the reasons for the increase in horticultural sales isthat the housing industry is spending more for sod and otherlandscape ornamentals,'' the report said. ``Also, cities are doingmore landscaping in the inner cities as well as in parks and alonghighways.''   California accounts for about 23 percent of total horticulturalsales, followed by Florida, nearly 15 percent, and Texas, 7 percent.   Of 2 million farms in the United States, there are fewer than38,000 horticultural operations. But in 1987, the most recentstatistics available, those had sales averaging $154,818 each,compared with $65,165 for all farms.   There are an estimated 57,000 retail floral outlets in the UnitedStates, the report said. Mass-market outlets, mostly grocery stores,account for 21,000, but the majority, an estimated 36,000, areindependent retail floral shops.   According to 1986 figures, grocery store sales of flowers andplants amounted to $1.49 billion, averaging $28 per square feet ofstore space, compared with $8 to $12 for other produce, the reportsaid.   The United States is the world's largest producer of flowers andplants, and American growers control about 95 percent of thedomestic market, the report said. But imports are important,totaling $451 million last year.   Colombia is the largest source of the imports, the report said.Others include the Netherlands, Canada, Costa Rica and Mexico.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   British wine drinkers offer a potential growthmarket for U.S. producers, the Agriculture Department says.   Robert Fondahn, the U.S. agricultural trade officer in London,says per capita wine consumption in the United Kingdom grew from 2liters in 1967 to 12 liters in 1987.   ``It currently is the only growth market in Europe for wine,'' hesaid. ``With 41 supplying countries, the United Kingdom has becomethe most sought after wine market in the world.''   Fondahn said in the September issue of AgExporter magazine thatthe U.K. imports 57.4 million cases of wine annually, compared withdomestic production of 9.4 million cases.   Although the U.S. market share is less than 1 percent, lastyear's sales of American wine to the U.K. rose 20 percent to 550,000cases, he said.   Consumers prefer white wines over red, although there has beensubstantial increases in red and rose wines lately.   ``The most dramatic development in wine sales in recent years hasbeen the establishment of wine bars,'' Fondahn said. ``Theseestablishments have introduced a large segment of the population toa variety of wines. Many of the wine bars offer their wines by thecase for home consumption.''   Fondahn said that as a member of the European Economic Community,the U.K. must comply with EEC requirements for the importation ofwine.   These requirements can be stringent and, in some cases, canhinder the sale of U.S. wine in the U.K., he said.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Catfish production continues to increase, butthe Agriculture Department says producers are getting lower pricesthan they did a year ago.   Production in July totaled 27.8 million pounds of live weightdelivered to processing plants, the department said Monday in itsmonthly report. That was up 17 percent from July 1988.   But prices paid to growers averaged 71 cents per pound, down 9cents a pound from a year earlier, the report said.   Production through the first seven months of 1989 totaled 196.6million pounds, up 16 percent from the same period last year.</TEXT></DOC>
