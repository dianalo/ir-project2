In one report issued last week, state Social ServicesCommissioner Cesar Perales found that child welfare workers oftenmishandled investigations and failed to monitor troubled families.He also faulted the way children were placed in foster homes andaccused the city of sloppy record-keeping, poor supervision andunclear policies.   A day later, the Human Resources Administration _ the city'schild welfare agency _ issued its own report which made many of thesame criticisms. In at least three cases, said the report, childrendied in 1988 in households that should have been visited frequentlyby social workers but were not.   In 1988, according to a city panel, 127 children may have diedof abuse or neglect. Of those, 58 or nearly half were previouslyknown to child welfare authorities. The panel said 18 of the deathsled to sanctions against welfare workers ranging from warnings andmemos to resignations.   A series of much-publicized horrors have made child welfare anissue in the city's current mayoral campaign.   The first was the killing of 6-year-old Lisa Steinberg inNovember 1987. Police and school officials were scored for failingto notice that the girl had been abused; the man who adopted herillegally, Joel Steinberg, was convicted of manslaughter earlierthis year.   The state's examination of how the city handled child-abusecases was prompted by the beating death last December of JessicaCortez, a 5-year-old whose case was known to welfare workers forsome time. The girl's mother and her boyfriend have been charged inthe death.   The state report said children taken from their parents wereshuttled from office to office, bedded on cots, placed ininappropriate settings and separated from their brothers andsisters.   The state report also alleged that there were instances whenwelfare workers did not look up records even though they knew therecords existed; when there were no visits to homes in which childabuse had been reported; and when families did not receivecounseling or other services ordered by Family Court judges.   In one case, the agency didn't even know that a child had frozento death in a family's unheated house, the report said.   But the report asserted that ``many of the problems encounteredby child protective workers today are really beyond theirmandate,'' particularly escalating drug use by parents.</TEXT></DOC>
