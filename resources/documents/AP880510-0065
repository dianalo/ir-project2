The judge's temporary order Monday specified that male nurses behired because of Lady Carroll Douglass Bing's apparent jealousy offemale nurses.   ``I'm not convinced that you are such a danger that you have tobe restricted altogether,'' state Supreme Court Justice CarmenCiparick told Lady Bing during one of her rare calm moments duringthe hearing.   The lawyer for the 86-year-old former Metropolitan Operadirector, who has been ruled incompetent to manage his own affairs,is trying to bar Lady Bing from their apartment. The hearing willcontinue next Monday.   Bing's lawyer, Paul Goldhamer, charges that Lady Bing, who has ahistory of mental problems, has abused her husband verbally andphysically.   He asked the judge to annul the Bings' marriage, claiming hisclient suffers from Alzheimer's disease and didn't know what he wasdoing when he married her last year.   Mrs. Ciparick's order requires the 48-year-old Lady Bing to stayaway from her husband from 10 a.m. until noon for his nutrition andhygiene needs, from 3:30 p.m. until 6:30 p.m. so he can nap, andfrom 9 p.m. until 10 p.m.   After 10 p.m., she may stay with Bing until 10 a.m. the nextday, the judge ruled, and if Bing must see a doctor, his wife maynot accompany him.   Lady Bing frequently disrupted the hearing, which startedThursday.   On Monday, nurse Irene Gault testified that when she tried tokeep an eye on Bing one day Lady Bing screamed at her, ``Go away!We don't need you!''   Lady Bing then ``bundled him onto a bus,'' the nurse said. ``Itried to go on the bus and Carroll started to swing her leg, as ifto kick me. Carroll pushed me off the bus with both hands on mychest.''   Lady Bing shouted, ``That isn't true! I never swung my leg.''   Ms. Gault said that March 7 ``was the third time I was hit byCarroll, in the hallway of their apartment. I had gone in with adetective to get his (Bing's) blood pressure.''   She said Carroll tried to block their entry, but Bing let themin. Ms. Gault said that when she put a blood pressure cuff on Bing,``Carroll struck me very forcefully on the arm and said, `Don't youput the make on my husband.'''</TEXT></DOC>
