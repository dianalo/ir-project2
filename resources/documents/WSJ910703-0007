Mr. Palmer raises questions concerning theinvolvement of the Carter administration in the Iran/Iraqwar, arguing that actions of the Carter administration wereat least as reprehensible as the alleged actions of theReagan campaign. Unfortunately, Mr. Palmer fails to recognizea critical distinction between the two matters: the allegedactions of the Carter administration were taken at thedirection of the President of the United States, who had beenpopularly elected by the American people, while the allegedactions of the Reagan campaign were directed by personselected by no one, simply to gain political advantage.   While it would be unfortunate indeed if the release of thehostages was due to the actions of elected administrationofficials, it is inexcusable if that delay resulted from theactions of political operatives.</LP><TEXT>   Michael J. Quinlan   Portland, Me.   ---   The allegations made by Abol Hassan Bani-Sadr in his book,&quot;My Turn to Speak: Iran, the Revolution and Secret Deals withthe U.S.,&quot; to the effect that I met with Saddam Hussein in1980 are absolutely false. It is also false to suggest thatthe Carter administration in any fashion whatsoever, directlyor indirectly, encouraged Iraq to undertake a militaryadventure against Iran.   Since Mr. Palmer resides in Washington and is apparently aprofessional historian, he might have taken the trouble toconsult either former President Carter, former secretaries ofstate Cyrus Vance or Edmund Muskie or myself beforedisseminating such irresponsible allegations.   Zbigniew Brzezinski   Washington   ---   &quot;Do the Democrats have the blood of a million Iranians andIraqis on their hands?&quot; Mr. Palmer asks. The answer,unfortunately, is yes. It was an open secret for more than adecade that the Carter administration, the Reaganadministration and even the Bush administration -- up to thelast minute before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait -- wanted tobuild up Saddam Hussein and his Sunni Muslims as acounterweight to Khomeini and his Shiite Muslims. The U.S.therefore supported and even encouraged Iraq in its war withIran. The government made feeble but successful efforts tokeep the news on the front pages, but it was widely commentedupon in this country, and even more so abroad.   After the beginning of Desert Shield/Storm, the &quot;secret&quot;that the U.S. had quietly supported Iraq's arms buildup,including the acquisition of much of the high-tech weaponryfacing our own troops, was &quot;revealed&quot; so often it became ajournalistic cliche.   Since I am not privy to the highest councils ofgovernment, my sources for this kind of information arenecessarily news magazines, newspaper columnists and foreignpublications such as The Economist. One has to wonder whereMr. Palmer and his colleagues at the Navy Historical Centerget their information, especially since they are part of theDefense Department.   Thomas A. Goldman   Bethesda, Md.   ---   Mr. Palmer suggests that the sins of President Carter indealing with Iran, as claimed by Mr. Bani-Sadr, far outweighthose of candidate Reagan and therefore the Democrats (notthe citizenry) should drop the whole subject. However, hefails to discuss (conveniently) the fact that Jimmy Carter,as President, had the right (or wrong) to negotiate with aforeign power and that Ronald Reagan, as a candidate, and hisassociates did (or did not) commit a series of illegal andpossibly treasonable acts.
