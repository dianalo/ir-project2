A beneficiary of racial preferences throughout his adultlife, the Supreme Court nominee preaches that the mostaggressive forms of affirmative action breed dependence andare stigmatizing. A victim of segregation, he saysintegration isn't always the solution, yet he lives in apredominantly white neighborhood and his wife is white.</LP><TEXT>   Although friends and associates describe him ascompassionate, he has singled out his own sister as anexample of welfare pathology. She says he has exaggerated theextent of her dependence on government support.   Earlier in his law career, Mr. Thomas said he wanted toavoid jobs handling racial issues. But when tapped by formerPresident Reagan for the top civil rights job in theEducation Department and later the chairmanship of the EqualEmployment Opportunity Commission, he took the posts.   Mr. Thomas is embraced by movement conservatives as one oftheir own, but there are serious questions as to whether hewould be a down-the-line vote for their causes on the SupremeCourt. Those who work with him at the federal appeals courthere say that in closed deliberations he has sometimesstrayed from predictable conservatism, especially oncriminal-law issues.   In short, Mr. Thomas's journey from rural hardship to theIvy League and now to the threshold of the highest court isfraught with contradictions. And one clear result is thatneither the staunchest of his defenders nor the fiercest ofhis critics really have any idea what the nation will begetting if Clarence Thomas is confirmed.   &quot;I don't think anyone knows what the full story is onJudge Thomas and his views,&quot; says Milton Bins, chairman ofthe Council of 100, an organization of black Republicans thatannounced its support of the nominee this week.   At the EEOC, Mr. Thomas hired Pamela Talkin, a moderateDemocrat, to be his chief of staff. Ms. Talkin, who supportshis nomination, says she has spent countless hours discussingissues of legal philosophy with him. &quot;Even after all thosehours, I can't predict where he's going to come out on manyissues,&quot; she says. &quot;His thoughts are always evolving.&quot;   Mr. Thomas, though he has sat on the appeals court foronly 15 months, remains a prohibitive favorite to beconfirmed by the Senate. But he is still so much an enigma toso many people that how he handles himself at hisconfirmation hearings will probably determine whether thevote is overwhelming or close.   So far, the elusive nature of Mr. Thomas's core beliefshas been a political advantage. Some liberal organizationsand the Congressional Black Caucus have announced theiropposition to him. But major black groups and the influentialLeadership Conference on Civil Rights, which helpedorchestrate the 1987 defeat of nominee Robert Bork, haverefused to take a position. Many of their members hesitate toattack a black nominee, especially because they realize thatif he was defeated, the next nominee would most likely be awhite conservative.   Mr. Thomas, 43, is observing Senate protocol by refrainingfrom discussing his legal views pending his confirmationhearing later in the summer. Yesterday, though, Sen. JohnDanforth, the Missouri Republican who is spearheading theconfirmation effort, sought in a Senate speech to defuseallegations that Mr. Thomas has already made up his mind tooppose the right to abortion on the Supreme Court.   Mr. Thomas himself, during a recent photo session onCapitol Hill, attempted to counter other criticism byacknowledging his debt to retiring Justice Thurgood Marshalland to the mainstream civil rights movement. But in aNovember 1987 interview with Reason magazine, he was askedwhether &quot;there are any areas&quot; where &quot;the civil rightsestablishment is doing really good work.&quot; His answer: &quot;No.&quot;   &quot;None?&quot; his questioner pressed.   &quot;I can't think of any,&quot; he repeated.   &quot;He has gotten this image of being an aloof, uncaringperson who believes he made it completely on his own andeveryone can achieve to that level on their own, too,&quot;worries Edward Hayes, a Washington lawyer who insists hisfriend has been misunderstood. &quot;Part of that,&quot; Mr. Hayesconcedes, &quot;is his fault.&quot; Mr. Thomas &quot;has not made his casevery well sometimes.&quot;   Mr. Thomas's statements about his sister are a case inpoint. When he first came to public attention at a 1980conference of conservative blacks, Mr. Thomas used her lifeback in his home community of Pin Point, Ga., to illustratethe debilitating effect of government support. &quot;She gets madwhen the mailman is late with her welfare check,&quot; he told theWashington Post at the time. &quot;That is how dependent she is.What's worse is that now her kids feel entitled to the checktoo. They have no motivation for doing better or getting outof that situation.&quot; He again referred to her welfaredependence in a 1983 Post interview.   His sister, Emma Mae Martin, says that although she was onwelfare during the 1970s, she stopped receiving benefits in1980. Even when she received assistance, she says, she alwaystried to work; she adds with pride that she only receivedgovernment aid when she was &quot;in desperate need. We aren'tdesperate now. We got a roof over our heads.&quot; Judge Thomashas offered to help pay for private schools for Ms. Martin'sfour children, but they declined his offer.   Ms. Martin, who works as a hospital cook, says she doesn'tresent her brother's comments. &quot;I don't even bother with hispolitics,&quot; she adds.   Michael Williams, the controversial black civil rightschief at the Education Department and a friend of Mr. Thomas,says that Mr. Thomas wasn't &quot;trying to `down' his sister.&quot;Mr. Williams explains that such examples from familyexperiences &quot;give some kind of realism to abstract points,even if there is some potential for perceptions ofinsensitivity.&quot;   Affirmative action provides another example of thecontradictions that characterize Mr. Thomas's life and views.   &quot;Ultimately, any race-conscious remedy is not good,&quot; Mr.Thomas said in a 1987 panel discussion. &quot;In any multi-ethnic,multi-racial society, race-conscious remedies generate severeracial conflicts.&quot; Yet he himself benefited from minoritypreference admissions policies at Holy Cross College and YaleLaw School.   Harry Singleton, a classmate and close friend of Mr.Thomas's, believes the Yale experience in the early 1970s wasimportant in forging the judge's later views. &quot;From day one,we saw affirmative action was being misused . . . by peoplewho were middle-class and didn't need it,&quot; recalls Mr.Singleton. Critics counter that such an attitude ignores thefact that the program was also helping Mr. Thomas himself,who was far from middle-class.   &quot;What's disturbing is that Clarence Thomas denigratesprograms that were important to his own rise,&quot; complainsGeorge Kassouf of the Alliance for Justice, a liberalcoalition opposing the nominee.   Mr. Thomas's backers acknowledge that he often states hisaffirmative action views in stark terms, but say that hisreal thoughts on the subject are considerably more complex.   &quot;Clarence really believes that the primary focus of anaffirmative action program should be seeking out the diamondin the rough,&quot; not simply anyone who is a member of aminority group, says Allen Moore, Mr. Thomas's former boss onSen. Danforth's staff. Mr. Thomas isn't opposed to specialscholarships, training and new opportunities for those whoneed it; rather, his friends say, he opposes numerical goalsand timetables in hiring and admissions that help entiregroups instead of particular individuals.   Mr. Thomas's professional and personal lives reflect manyof the same tensions evident in his thinking on affirmativeaction. After law school, he rejected offers from corporatelaw firms because he feared being viewed as a token black.Later, as an aide to Sen. Danforth in Washington, hespecifically cited the EEOC as one place he wouldn't want towork. &quot;He thought he would not develop as a professional ifhe were relegated only to `black issues,'&quot; says Mr. Hayes.   Yet when the Reagan administration plucked him out as apromising conservative black, he took successive civil rightsjobs at the Education Department and as EEOC chief. Mr.Thomas explained in the 1987 Reason magazine interview thathe was &quot;insulted&quot; by both offers but accepted them because&quot;if you don't do it, what are you going to say about theseissues in the future?&quot;   Mr. Thomas came to be perceived as the enemy by civilrights groups, who accused him of rolling back EEOCenforcement and allowing the agency to be used to frightenoff the victims of discrimination it was designed to help.But Mr. Singleton, who succeeded Mr. Thomas in the educationpost and who spoke with him almost daily, says Mr. Thomasactually saw himself as struggling to moderate theinitiatives of more extreme conservatives in theadministration.   &quot;You try to make the best of the situation,&quot; says Mr.Singleton. &quot;We were there to mitigate the damage.&quot;   While Mr. Thomas's views on race have always contained astrain of self-help philosophy, that strain has takenmarkedly different forms over the years. In college, headopted for a time the militant black-nationalist ideology ofthe Black Panthers. More recently, he has questioned whethermajor civil rights groups have overemphasized integration.   Friends say that there is no contradiction between theseviews and his life in Washington's predominantly whiteVirginia suburbs with his second wife, Virginia. &quot;He stillbelieves that blacks have to help each other, and living in awhite neighborhood and intermarriage aren't inconsistent withthat,&quot; says Ms. Talkin, his former chief of staff.   Nor has he forgotten his black roots. &quot;He used to comepast my desk to talk about being poor in Georgia,&quot; saysJewell Mack, an EEOC secretary. &quot;We were always laughingabout how we both picked cotton.&quot; Allen Moore recounted aless cheerful reminder in a recent article in the WashingtonPost. On a stroll in downtown Washington, Mr. Thomas askedMr. Moore, who is white, to hail him a cab. &quot;I have troublegetting a cab downtown, and it's virtually impossible inGeorgetown,&quot; Mr. Moore quoted Mr. Thomas as saying.   Mr. Thomas's views are largely unknown on many legalissues, but his constitutional philosophy is one that mayproduce unpredictable results. In recent years, he has arguedin speeches and articles for interpreting the Constitution toinclude natural rights that aren't explicitly included in theBill of Rights. He derives these natural rights from theDeclaration of Independence, which proclaims the existence ofsuch &quot;inalienable rights&quot; as &quot;life&quot; and &quot;liberty.&quot;   Abortion-rights groups fear that he would use a rationalethat fetuses have natural rights as a reason to vote tooverrule Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 decision recognizing theright to abortion. Their concerns stem from his 1987 praiseof an article on natural rights by conservative LewisLehrman, who argued that fetuses do in fact have such rights.   But Sen. Danforth yesterday said that he has asked Mr.Thomas whether he meant to apply his natural-rights views toabortion. &quot;His answer was absolutely no,&quot; Sen. Danforth said.&quot;He has formulated no views on the relationship betweennatural law and abortion.&quot;   Although Mr. Thomas has espoused his natural-rights viewsin conservative circles, it is difficult to tell in whatdirection they would lead him. For the last two decades atleast, natural-rights philosophy has been the province ofliberal law professors and has been criticized byconservatives as not being based on the text of theConstitution.   Mr. Thomas hasn't had any occasion to apply thisphilosophy on the appeals court, and it's unclear whatresults it would produce on the Supreme Court. Says GeraldGunther, a constitutional-law scholar at Stanford Law School:&quot;A natural-law philosophy is not a philosophy of judicialrestraint.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
