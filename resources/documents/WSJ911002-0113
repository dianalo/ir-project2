The study of 92 patients is the first major trial of anydrug for the mysterious ailment and the results yield freshevidence that it may be caused by some viral infection andimmune system irregularities. Researchers said that magneticresonance imaging exams showed that about half the people inthe study had unexplained brain abnormalities.</LP><TEXT>   The study was conducted by Hem Pharmaceuticals Corp.,which is developing Ampligen. While the drug appeared to beeffective for some people, it doesn't cure the ailment. Andit isn't clear what portion of those diagnosed with chronicfatigue may benefit from Ampligen or how long they would haveto be treated.   &quot;You can't really judge yet whether it will prove to be afeasible therapy,&quot; says Anthony Komaroff, a Harvard MedicalSchool researcher who is familiar with the findings. &quot;It'sonly a partial report. But it surely looks promising.&quot;   A spokesman at the Food and Drug Administration said thedata are &quot;very preliminary&quot; and that &quot;it's too early to claimthat Ampligen is a dramatic treatment for chronic fatiguesyndrome.&quot; The spokesman added that &quot;the product hassignificant side effects that would have to be consideredagainst any claimed benefits.&quot; The agency is constrained bylaw from commenting more specifically, the spokesman said.   People familiar with the process say Hem filed anapplication with the FDA on Sept. 3 to try the drug on alimited number of additional people under a policy aimed atbroadening access to promising experimental medicines forserious diseases before they are approved for marketing. Theagency has 30 days to respond to the application, known as aTreatment IND, and a decision is expected by later this week.   A favorable decision isn't assured, but it would be aboost for Hem, a fledgling, closely held company based inPhiladelphia that has struggled with credibility problems inan effort to prove that Ampligen is an effective treatmentfor a variety of illnesses, including AIDS and some cancers.In any event, any decision on whether to permit broadmarketing of Ampligen is several months or years away.   Chronic fatigue syndrome is characterized by severe,prolonged fatigue, muscle and joint pain and by neurologicalproblems. Symptoms mimic other diseases, making diagnosisdifficult, and many doctors believe it results frompsychiatric troubles. Severity varies; some patients continueworking while others are completely bedridden.   It isn't known how many people are afflicted, but the U.S.Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, which is conducting astudy to determine its prevalence, says it gets up to 3,000calls a month from people who think they have the illness.The Chronic Fatigue and Immune Dysfunction SyndromeAssociation Inc., a patient organization based in Charlotte,N.C., says it received 40,000 inquiries last summer alone.   Patients in the study were severely stricken with theailment for at least three years and all required assistancefor such routine activities as getting dressed, going to thebathroom and balancing a checkbook. All were being treated byone of four doctors who specialize in chronic fatiguesyndrome with practices in Charlotte and in Incline Village,Nev., Portland, Ore., and Houston, and who are amongco-authors of the study.   Researchers said 45 of the patients received twice-weeklyinfusions of Ampligen while 47 got a saltwater placebo.Neither doctors nor patients knew who was getting the drug.Some patients experienced flu-like reactions early in thestudy, but the incidence of such &quot;adverse events&quot; wasn'tstatistically different between the drug and placebo groups,according to William Carter, principal investigator and aco-inventor of the drug. He said he knew of no instanceswhere a dose was reduced or treatment was stopped due to sideeffects. Dr. Carter presented results of the study at ameeting of the American Society for Microbiology in Chicago.   Dr. Carter, who is also president and a shareholder ofHem, said the study found that by two separate scoringsystems, patients treated 24 weeks with Ampligen increasedtheir daily living activity levels on average by about 20%,compared with little or no increase for those on placebo.Ampligen patients on average showed increased endurance ontreadmill tests by the 24th week while the performance ofthose on placebo declined. Seven Ampligen patients werehospitalized for their symptoms during the course of thestudy for a total of 19 days, Dr. Carter said, while sevenplacebo patients spent a total of 114 days in the hospital.   The patients &quot;advanced progressively in daily livingactivities,&quot; Dr. Carter said. &quot;They thought better, were lessforgetful and had fewer headaches than patients in theplacebo group.&quot; While many Ampligen patients continued tohave symptoms after 24 weeks, most could carry on their liveswith more independence, he added.   Dr. Carter said three factors were associated withpatients who responded particularly well to Ampligen: anacute flu-like onset of the illness; elevated levels ofinterleukin-1, an infection-fighting agent of the immunesystem, at the beginning of the study; and presence on an MRIexam of unidentified white spots in front portions of thebrain associated with memory and certain intellectualactivities.   Scientists believe the drug works by regulating an immunesystem pathway that in normal people becomes activated whenthe body senses it is being invaded by a virus. Elevatedinterleukin-1 levels are one indication that in chronicfatigue patients, the pathway is overactive. Researchers alsobelieve that Ampligen blocks virus production.   At the end of the study, interleukin-1 levels haddiminished in patients who responded to the drug, Dr. Cartersaid, an indication that the viral pathway activity wasreduced. It isn't yet known whether the white spots, whichhave been reported in chronic fatigue patients by otherresearchers, healed after Ampligen treatment, he said.   Whether or not the drug ultimately is useful in treatingchronic fatigue, the study's findings refute arguments thatits symptoms are provoked by psychological problems, saysHarvard's Dr. Komaroff, who is a member of Hem's scientificadvisory board, but who hasn't any financial stake in thecompany. &quot;This isn't a medicine that acts on the psyche,&quot; hesays. &quot;It acts on the body.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
