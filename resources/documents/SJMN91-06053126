We'rekinda edgy.&quot;;    They weren't the only ones. Up and down Watt Avenue,shopkeepers and store clerks spoke anxiously of the person police believe haskilled six people in the area during a seven-day span. Outside the 7-Elevenmarket, electricians were busy installing new high-wattage bulbs in theparking light lamps. Sacramento Sheriff's Department cruisers clogged the sidestreets.;    A sheriff's official said Thursday that investigators havedeveloped more than 100 leads and identified about a dozen &quot;people ofinterest&quot; but no suspects in the shootings.;    At the Cork Stop liquor store,co-owner Debra Chahal grew suspicious when a reporter asked her normal closingtime.;    &quot;How do I know you aren't the person who done all this?&quot; she asked.&quot;You could just be coming around to find out when I leave. I've got a gun hereunder the counter.&quot;;    The slayings, all done at close range with the samesmall-caliber handgun, occurred exactly one week apart, at two businessesexactly one mile from each other. Three people were killed in each incident,apparently without attracting the attention of anyone in the heavily traveledbusiness district on the city's near north side. Both sets of killingsoccurred around the same time -- between 11 p.m. and midnight.;    Policespeculate the killer is doing it for kicks and has selected the locationbecause of its easy access to nearby Business Route 80.;    &quot;He's obviously apsychopath,&quot; speculated Sam Ruffner, owner of the BP station. &quot;I'll tell you,when my phone rings at night, my heart quits.&quot;;    Ruffner's employee, KennyMarkle, said his girlfriend, Jennifer Todd, works at the Round Table Pizzaparlor that was the scene of the killer's latest rampage. Because business wasslow Tuesday night, she was allowed to leave early, Markle said -- two hoursbefore her co-workers were rounded up and executed.;    &quot;She's lucky to bealive,&quot; he said. &quot;But she's back at work already.&quot;;    Harold E. Anderson,owner of the nearby Zeke's Guns andamp; Ammo, is one of the few businessmen in thearea who isn't worried about armed intruders. But several customers have comein during the past few days looking for firepower.;    &quot;It hasn't turned intoa panic situation yet, but we've had a few people come in because of it. Wetry and talk them out of buying a gun,&quot; Anderson said. &quot;Most of us here areex-law enforcement and we know that customers like that are more dangerous tothemselves than anything else.&quot;;    Anderson said the killer's choice ofweapon -- apparently a .25-caliber automatic -- reveals that the murdererknows little about handguns.;    &quot;That's not a gun,&quot; Anderson saiddisdainfully. &quot;It's a toy. He has to get right up next to 'em and kill 'embecause that's the only way to kill someone with a gun like that. I won't evensell the things.&quot;;    Not everyone in the area was paranoid, however.;    AtMr. Video, a late-night video store near the Round Table Pizza parlor, storemanagers were busy Thursday interviewing job applicants to replace a clerk whoquit Wednesday because of the killings. One young applicant looked up from hisapplication form and smiled when asked if he was nervous about working in thearea.;    &quot;No, I don't suppose I am,&quot; he said. &quot;I need the job.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  GARY WEBB, Mercury News Sacramento Bureau  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Sacramento  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910222  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  658  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday February 22, 199100053126,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
