Augusto Pinochet, graced thewalls.   But a few weeks ago, as a trio played Mozart and Vivaldiand with the archbishop of Santiago on hand to give hisblessing, company executives announced that the plant wouldbe converted to produce metallurgical, health and forestryproducts.</LP><TEXT>   Having built his company and his fortune selling weaponsto such controversial regimes such as those in Iraq andEthiopia or co-producing arms with South Africa, CarlosCardoen now literally wants to turn swords into plowshares.   The rush to diversify is designed to salvage Mr. Cardoen'sgroup after the loss of traditional customers because ofUnited Nations or Chilean-imposed embargoes. But Mr. Cardoenalso is trying to salvage his image after a string ofproblems silenced the usually outspoken 48-year-oldbusinessman, who declined to be interviewed for this article.   &quot;This has been the worst year in terms of image thatCardoen has suffered in a long time,&quot; says his spokesman,Fernando Paulsen. &quot;He's been extremely successfuleconomically. What he needs is a corollary of success:legitimacy.&quot;   Had the success of Industrias Cardoen been built onexporting fruit or other noncontroversial goods that are thefoundation of Chile's healthy economic growth, Mr. Cardoenwould probably be held up as a model entrepreneur. But beinga maverick in the arms business has given hisentrepreneurship an edge of opportunism and unscrupulousness.Mr. Cardoen has charged that he is the victim of a doublestandard and a campaign by big armsmakers whose markets hestole.   In addition to being vilified for his ties to Iraq, Mr.Cardoen set off fears of a regional arms race recently whenhe admitted his company was looking into the potential offuel air explosive bombs, a weapon nicknamed the poor man'satomic bomb. The bomb, used by the U.S. in Vietnam andthought to be in Saddam Hussein's arsenal, disperses a cloudof aerosol fuel that, when ignited in the air, suffocatesanyone within 400 square yards and spreads a damaging,mile-square shock wave.   His name has also been linked -- without reason, he hassaid -- to the mysterious death here last year of Britishjournalist Jonathan Moyle. And he is being sued in the U.S.by an arms broker who once worked for him who claims he isowed $30 million in commissions.   Until recently, embargoes made Industrias Cardoen thrive.Mr. Cardoen has joked he owes his existence to Sen. EdwardKennedy, who sponsored the law banning U.S. weapons sales toChile because of its dismal human rights record under Gen.Pinochet.   With Chile on the brink of war with Argentina in 1978following a dispute over ownership of three Beagle Channelislands, Gen. Pinochet was forced to turn to localmanufacturers for arms. Mr. Cardoen, who had just founded amining explosives firm after leaving the U.S. mining companyIreco Chemicals, thus won his first defense contract, makingland mines.   But it was the Iraq-Iran war that gave Industrias Cardoenits big break. Early in the war, Mr. Cardoen flew to Baghdadto drop off his brochures, and his cheap version of clusterbombs -- a shell that contains several smaller bombs thatscatter before exploding -- drew Baghdad's attention. WhatMr. Cardoen has described as a &quot;very friendly relationship&quot;with Saddam Hussein ensued.   At their peak, sales to Iraq represented 95% of thegroup's sales, totaling between $300 million and $400 millionbetween 1980 and 1988. Later, Iraq called on the Cardoengroup to build a plant that would produce electronic bombfuses in wartime and television sets in peacetime. But theU.N. embargo cut construction short, costing the group&quot;between $40 million and $50 million,&quot; Mr. Cardoen has said.   Mr. Cardoen apparently had other plans to sell weapons toIraq. Potential products included a long-range cannon thegroup was co-producing with South Africa's state-controlledArmscor, skirting a U.N. embargo on buying military equipmentfrom Pretoria. Chilean defense specialist Raul Sohr alleged:&quot;Cardoen is supplying a `Made in Chile' label and after-salesservice for the guns that helps South Africa escape the U.N.ban on arms sales.&quot; But Chile's return to democracy hasforced Mr. Cardoen to end what he's called his &quot;very closerelationship&quot; with South Africa.   Plans to market a modified version of the U.S.-made Bell206 helicopter with civilian and military applications faredno better. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has heldup authorization of the project for fears it would end up inIraq.   It was the helicoper project that got Mr. Cardoen's namelinked to the death of Mr. Moyle, a British reporter who wasfound hanging in the closet of his hotel room while inSantiago to cover an air show. Police first said it wassuicide, but both Mr. Moyle's family and the Chileaninvestigating magistrate question this. The case remainsunexplained, but one theory circulating here is that Iraqiagents killed Mr. Moyle because he was investigatingBaghdad's secret plans to buy a missile-system that could bemounted on the Cardoen-adapted Bell helicopter.   Mr. Cardoen has denied any involvement in the Moyle case.   The Chilean arms maker usually has no qualms about what hedoes. He has often said: &quot;The moral problem doesn't lie withhe who produces weapons, but with he who uses them.&quot;   Still, Cardoen officials talk of retrenching. &quot;I decidedto fundmentally change the course of the company,&quot; saysIsmael Vicuna, Industrias Cardoen's new general manager.   &quot;Before, there were bombs on these presentation stands,&quot;Mr. Vicuna says, sitting in a conference room in thecompany's offices. Now there are glossy pictures of thegroup's diversified activities: a bank, an airplane-leasingcompany, a match company, hotels and tourism, mining, civilengineering, fruit exports and a blue-jeans factory to beopened soon. Mr. Vicuna says the group employs about 3,500people and should report 1990 sales of between $100 millionand $120 million, of which defense will account for about $25million.   But some doubt the company's claims that it is scalingback its defense activities. &quot;They claim the arms side isalmost closed, and then everybody is shocked to see they'relooking into the fuel air explosive bomb,&quot; says Mr. Sohr, thedefense specialist.</TEXT></DOC>
