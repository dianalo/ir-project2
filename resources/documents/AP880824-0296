Wheat and oats alsoadvanced.   On other markets, coffee, livestock, precious-metals andstock-index futures all rose while energy futures finished mostlylower.   Meteorologists and grain analysts were skeptical of theMidwestern frost talk, which helped drive Chicago corn futuresprices up the permitted daily limit of 10 cents a bushel.   ``It's not going to happen,'' said James Roemer, a meteorologistand commodities adviser for Freese-Notis Weather Inc. and WeatherTrades Inc., both of Des Moines, Iowa.   ``There's going to be some 30s and 40s in parts of Michigan andparts of the Great Lakes region so it'll be cool for the weekendand then we'll be warming up again next week,'' he said.   National Weather Service meteorologist Jane Hollingsworth inChicago predicted lows in the 40s this weekend in the NorthernPlains and Great Lakes region ``but it doesn't look like there'sany indications right now for freezing temperatures in theMidwest,'' she said.   The National Weather Service predicted above-normal temperaturesand below-normal rainfall for the Midwest next week.   Roemer said early frosts _ early meaning September _ followedtwo of the last four summer droughts, in 1974 and 1983.   He said the early freeze in 1974 wiped out a large part of thesoybean crop but added that this year's crops were maturing at anabove-average pace, so frost would have to occur no later thanSept. 20 to cause significant damage.   Jerry Gidel, an analyst with G.H. Miller andamp; Co., a Chicago-baseddivision of the British-owned trading company LIT America Inc.,called the freeze talk ``crazy.''   ``I find it hard to believe with all the hot weather we'vehad,'' he said.   Crop futures also advanced on perceptions that rain was slowingthe wheat harvest in the Soviet Union, possibly reducing the amountof wheat that will be harvested there, Gidel said.   Wheat settled 1{ cents to 7 cents higher with the contract fordelivery in September at $3.90} a bushel; corn was 4 cents to 10cents higher with September at $2.83} a bushel; oats were 5 centsto 6} cents higher with September at $2.54 a bushel; soybeans were12 cents to 27{ cents higher with September at $8.31{ a bushel.   Coffee futures surged on New York's Coffee, Sugar andamp; CocoaExchange on continuing concerns about dry weather in Brazil, theworld's leading coffee producer and exporter.   Coffee settled 2.91 cents to 5.46 cents higher with September at$1.2668 a pound.   Unexpectedly strong demand for beef by retailers boosted cattlefutures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange while strong cash hogmarkets helped to push the pork futures higher, analysts said.   Live cattle settled unchanged to .83 cent higher with October at71.30 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .33 cent to 1.05 centshigher with August at 81.75 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to.40 cent higher with October at 40.47 cents a pound; frozen porkbellies were .35 cent to the limit 2 cents higher with August at37.97 cents a pound.   Precious metals rallied on the New York Mercantile Exchange onmostly technical factors with the inflationary implications of theweaker dollar providing additional support, said Jack Barnanel,director of futures trading for Gruntal andamp; Co. in New York.   Gold settled $2.60 to $2.80 higher with October at $438.60 atroy ounce; silver was 5 cents to 5.4 cents higher with Septemberat $6.79 a troy ounce.   Stock-index futures advanced sharply in a technically motivated,late-afternoon surge on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where thecontract for delivery of the Standard andamp; Poor's 500 index settled4.45 points higher at 261.75.   Most energy futures slipped lower in lethargic trading on theNew York Mercantile Exchange.
