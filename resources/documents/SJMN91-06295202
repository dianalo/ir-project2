It was Walsh who sought out Young last Monday and quickly applieda psychological tourniquet to the anguished 49ers quarterback.;   Althoughthere are a variety of indications that some members of the organization werebent severely out of shape by Walsh's intervention, Sunday's 35-3 victory overthe Detroit Lions began that morning.;   Young was coming off a mentallydevastating 39-34 loss to Atlanta, and much of the postgame talk had beenabout the physical beating he also had endured. But Walsh, the former 49erscoach who always has been one of Young's staunchest advocates, knew thequarterback needed a friend more than first-aid.;   &quot;It was nice of him tocall me in (to see him),&quot; Young said. &quot;I didn't know it would turn out to besomething everybody knew about.&quot;;   Holmgren, a Walsh protege whoseoffensive-coordinator job requires him to read moods as well as defenses,noted Sunday that getting Young emotionally prepared for the Detroit game &quot;wasa big part of the week.&quot;;   With the assist from Walsh, which Holmgren calmlydeclined to discuss, the week became a huge success.;   Against theunimpressive Lions, Young completed his first 16 passes on a tragicallyunnatural, ash-dark afternoon at Candlestick Park.;   With the 49ers' famedshort-passing game looking particularly sharp, Young connected on his firstnine throws, but one completion was wiped out by a penalty. His ninth attemptmissed Jerry Rice, but another penalty kept the streak alive. Young finishedthe first half, officially, 13 for 13 for 184 yards with one touchdown, andthe 49ers led 21-3.;   Young looked confident and loose -- a perfectly properJoe Montana replacement.;   &quot;This was kind of a must game for us,&quot; Young said.&quot;I don't know how loose I could have been.&quot;;   The key might have been the49ers' reaction after their first possession ended inside the Detroit 20 on aKeith Henderson fumble. That kind of mistake had been a killer in the team'sfour losses, and a predictable response on the sideline would have been acollective cringe.;   Instead, Young said, there was a &quot;collective redoublingof effort.&quot;;   With just the slightest trace of a smile, he also noted that,altogether, the team has redoubled its effort 'about three times this year --so we're six times our effort.&quot;;   In other words, Young explained, the 49ersare prepared to do &quot;whatever it takes.&quot;;   Getting Young to that point wasHolmgren's responsibility, and if he was upset by Walsh's unrequested help, hedidn't even hint at it.;   &quot;I'd like to think I'm as good an amateurpsychologist as anyone,&quot; said Holmgren, who summarized Young's role as havingto play &quot;a pressure position in a pressure situation.&quot;;   But as enjoyable asit was to steamroll the Lions -- Young didn't want to come out after threequarters even though the final score already was established -- the pressurehardly is off. Three straight road games are coming up, and the 49ers stillare four games behind West Division-leading New Orleans.;   &quot;Life's tough,&quot;Young said. &quot;You've just got to get tougher.&quot;;   He was not only tough Sunday,he was exquisite. He finished with 18 completions in 20 attempts for 237 yardsand two TDs. And Steve Young being Steve Young, he also added 40 rushing yardsin seven carries.;   Today, Young won't need to go see Walsh. For the timebeing at least, the bleeding has stopped.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mike Antonucci column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  San Francisco  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911021  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  581  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, October 21, 199100295202,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
