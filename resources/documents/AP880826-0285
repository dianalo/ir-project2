(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal bankruptcy judge ruled todaythat former financier Marvin L. Warner cannot escape the payment of$22 million in restitution he was ordered to make by an Ohio court.   Lawrence Kane Jr., special prosecutor for the state of Ohio,said the order by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge George L. Proctor was``very significant.''   Proctor granted the state of Ohio's motion for summary judgmentin the case.   Warner, 69, a former U.S. ambassador to Switzerland, owned theCincinnati-based Home State Savings Bank, which collapsed in 1985after losing $144 million in investments.   Warner was sentenced in March 1987 by an Ohio judge to 3{ yearsin prison and ordered to pay $22 million in restitution after hewas convicted of six counts of unauthorized acts and three countsof securities fraud in connection with the bank's failure. He isappealing that conviction and sentence.   Warner, who filed for reorganization of his finances underChapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in October 1987, hadsought a ruling that he was no longer liable for restitutionordered by the state of Ohio because he had filed for bankruptcy.   But the judge ruled Warner ``cannot avoid the $22 million orderthrough the bankruptcy mechanism,'' Kane said.   The ruling, Kane said, will allow the state of Ohio to proceedagainst Warner to collect the money, including any future assets hemay obtain.   According to Warner's financial schedules, creditors are seekingto recover $4.5 billion from him. He claimed he has only $384million in assets.</TEXT></DOC>
