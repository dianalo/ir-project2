Jim Bakker had sex withJessica Hahn, lost his PTL ministry and went to jail for fleecinghis flock. Jimmy Swaggart confessed to moral failure with a NewOrleans prostitute.   On the other hand, Playboy potentate Hugh Hefner made an honestwoman out of one of his Bunnies by wedding her, which somesociologists said heralded the end to the one-night stand. Gofigure.   The sheer terror of AIDS, which can be spread through sex, didits part to modify behavior. Almost 70,000 Americans died of AIDSduring the decade, including Rock Hudson, Liberace, and artists,athletes and journalists.   Gambling turned Pete Rose's field of dreams into a baseballnightmare. The belly-flopping Charlie Hustle broke Ty Cobb'scherished record for all-time hits. But he was banned for life forbetting on games in the sport's worst scandal in seven decades.   Michael Jackson moonwalked with a single, sequined glove, andhis ``Thriller'' album sold a record 40 million copies. Materialgirl Madonna flashed Marilyn Monroe-style sex appeal.   American life in the '80s had a deadly side, too.   Drug wars sizzled as the Cold War thawed. Crack cocaine,virtually unheard of in 1985, riddled American cities with therandomness of an assault gun by decade's end.   Mass murderers stalked a McDonald's in San Ysidro, Calif., aschoolyard in Stockton, Calif., and a printing plant in Louisville,Ky. Serial killer Ted Bundy was executed; Seattle's Green Riverkiller, blamed for over 40 deaths, remained at large.   Around the world, war broke old yardsticks for barbarity withmodern weapons that killed and maimed with cold efficiency.   Iran and Iraq fought a $400 billion, eight-year conflict thatcost up to 1 million lives. The ayatollah's boy soldiers carriedtheir own coffins into battle; Iraq countered human waves withpoison gas.   Americans, too, killed and were killed in the Persian Gulf. AnIraqi missile killed 37 sailors aboard the USS Stark, which wasmistaken for an Iranian warship. The USS Vincennes confused an IranAir A300 Airbus for a warplane, killing 290 civilians with amissile, an eerie near-replay of another ``shootdown,'' when aSoviet fighter blew Korean Air Lines Flight 007 out the sky,killing 269 people, after the jetliner wandered into forbiddenairspace.   Beirut got bloodier during a 14-year-old civil war betweenage-old religious foes. Two Lebanese presidents were assassinatedseven years apart, the second only 17 days into his tenure.   All told, Lebanon's casualties mounted to 150,000, mostlycivilians. And again America paid a price. Sixty-three people werekilled in 1983 when a suicide truck bomber leveled the U.S.Embassy, and 241 U.S. servicemen, serving as peacekeepers, died inthe terror bombing of their barracks.   In Afghanistan, a civil war between the Soviet-backed governmentand U.S.-supported insurgents claimed 1.5 million lives. Gorbachevcalled the conflict ``a bleeding wound,' and ended nine years ofintervention by Soviet military forces in 1989. The Soviet toll:13,310 dead.   In Ethiopia, a non-stop civil war worsened the suffering of akiller drought. Casualties from fighting and famine were estimatedat 1 million.   Assassins felled Egypt's Anwar Sadat, India's Indira Gandhi andthe Philippine opposition leader Benigno Aquino, whose widow,Corazon, later was elected president and ousted Ferdinand Marcosand his well-shod wife, Imelda.   John Lennon was silenced by a bullet. Pope John Paul II, likeReagan, survived a gunman's attempt.   Terrorism, some of it government-subsidized, spread insidiously.   U.S. hostages were freed by Iran on Jan. 20, 1981, the dayReagan was sworn in and Jimmy Carter exited the White House.   But more hostages were grabbed by Iran-backed extremists inBeirut. Eight Americans are still held, including journalist TerryAnderson, now in his fifth year of captivity.   Reagan retaliated for a terrorist bombing in West Germany withan air strike against Libya's Col. Moammar Gadhafi, whom he called``the mad dog of the Middle East.''   Terrorists hijacked airplanes and a cruise ship. A bomb downedPan Am Flight 103 in 1988, resulting in 270 deaths.   Terror of a natural sort stalked the globe. Technology gave mannew weapons for tracking storms and predicting disasters. ButGilbert and Hugo redefined the power and cost of hurricanes.   An angry Earth blew its top in 1980 at Mount St. Helens, and aColombian volcano hatched a 1985 mudslide that killed 25,000. Theground quaked in Southern Italy, Mexico City, Soviet Armenia andNorthern California.   These were the '80s, when the Stars and Stripes were burnable,and the Hammer and Sickle drooped listless in the ill winds, butboth were waved by U.S. sailors at a seaborne summit.   If the fast-forward blur of change seemed too much, solace couldbe found in the durability of democracy's icons: The U.S.Constitution began its third century; the Statue of Liberty had amakeover and celebrated its 100th birthday.   And in the new revolutions, the words of an old revolution,Jefferson's revolution, rang out.   ``We hold these truths to be self-evident,'' a brewery worker inCzechoslovakia declaimed to fellow strikers as the decade closed,``that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by theircreator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life,liberty and the pursuit of happiness.''   Past is prologue. Farewell, 1980s. Hello, 1990s.   End Advance for Weekend Editions of Dec. 16-17.</TEXT></DOC>
