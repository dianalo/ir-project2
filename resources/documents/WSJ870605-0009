Democrats will use his confirmation hearings to try to get his support for tax increases, which Reagan opposes. Greenspan privately believes taxes should be raised, but he probably will try to avoid the issue. Senate Banking Chairman Proxmire, says an aide, mainly &quot;wants to know how independent Greenspan would be&quot; from political pressures. But confirmation is expected.    Greenspan's influence at the White House will be considerably greater than Volcker's. An important test will come over the decision to fill the one remaining vacancy on the board. Supply-siders will urge that another of their own be named. But Greenspan, unlike Volcker, almost certainly will get someone of his liking, sending a signal of backing from the president.    Fed staffers predict that New York Fed President Gerald Corrigan, because of his global expertise, will become even more powerful under Greenspan.    GORBACHEV STRENGTHENS his hold on the Soviet military apparatus.    His ouster of two top defense officials after a West German youth's plane landed in Red Square is only the first step, U.S. officials and analysts believe. They expect the Soviet leader to use the security failure to put more of his own people in high military positions. &quot;It's the perfect issue for beating up on the military,&quot; says Soviet expert Stephen Sestanovich.    But even as Gorbachev tightens his grip on the military, he is starting a push for more economic changes that could bring more conflict within the Kremlin. U.S. experts say he is moving fast for fear that if he slows the process, his opposition will have a chance to regroup. The apparent No. 2 official, Yigor Ligachev, still hasn't fully endorsed Gorbachev's economic course.    CANDIDATES VIE for early money to fuel presidential campaigns.    Bush clears $700,000 at a Los Angeles event, pushing him well above $7 million. Robertson also claims to have grossed $7 million, but the net after direct-mail costs isn't known. Dole clears $4 million, du Pont about $2 million. Kemp also raises about $2 million but goes $200,000 in debt.    Biden's total of over $2 million tops Democrats; he rakes in $435,000 at a California lunch serving imported caviar. Dukakis's take isn't disclosed, but he may cash in big on his Greek heritage. Simon competes with Biden for Jewish donors, and many give to both. Gephardt raises $1.55 million. The candidates hope a good financial showing will increase credibility and contributions.    &quot;There are three campaigns,&quot; says a Democratic strategist, &quot;There's Iowa, there's fund raising, and there's the rest of the nation.&quot;    SON OF GEPHARDT? Senate Majority Leader Byrd and Finance Chairman Bentsen mull revising the Senate trade bill toward the stiff sanctions in the House-passed Gephardt amendment. A Senate bill as stringent as the House amendment wouldn't pass, Bentsen says, but &quot;some shade of tightening up could get a lot of votes.&quot;    BAKER FAILED to persuade Reagan to invoke the War Powers Act in deciding to launch U.S. escorts of Kuwaiti tankers in the Persian Gulf. The White House chief of staff had hoped to placate Congress, but Weinberger and National Security adviser Carlucci prevailed against him. Congressional opposition has been stiff, as Baker feared.    WHAT A DIFFERENCE a day makes. In a letter dated May 14, GOP Sen. Dole strongly opposes public financing of congressional elections because it &quot;would result in the American people subsidizing&quot; such campaigns. In a May 15 letter, Dole asks the Federal Election Commission to approve him for public matching funds as a presidential candidate.    GRUMBLING GROWS at the economic summit about a U.S. plan to have the summit nations' finance ministers meet three times a year. Though some Europeans fear the plan will curb their independence, Treasury chief Baker has won approval of it. One concession: Over U.S. objections, details of the plan will be kept secret.    REHNQUIST EARNS high marks for openness at the Supreme Court.    The first-year chief justice's candor and relaxed style are praised by his colleagues, who chafed at Burger's heavy-handed manner. At a recent conference of federal judges, Rehnquist comfortably answered questions for 45 minutes. In contrast to Burger, he was conciliatory, praising the quality of federal courts and of lawyers.    &quot;There's an air of congeniality about this chief that seems to infuse the whole court,&quot; says University of Virginia law professor A. E. Dick Howard. Rehnquist plans an unprecedented party for Supreme Court reporters and agrees to cooperate with a public-television documentary on the court. Meanwhile, he keeps the pace of issuing opinions ahead of past years.    Some conservatives complain that Rehnquist has had little impact on court ideology, still surprisingly liberal.    MINOR MEMOS: Perfectly clear -- one bank economist describes Fed Chairman-designate Greenspan as having &quot;an intuitive inductive approach with a Keynesian aggregate-demand overlay.&quot; . . . GOP presidential candidate Haig calls the Iran arms scandal a &quot;brouhaha&quot; because &quot;these days you don't dare call it an affair.&quot; . . . Nixon lunches at New York's fancy Le Cirque restaurant with former Democratic party foe Edward Bennett Williams and even picks up the tab of more than $500. </TEXT></DOC>
