<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-55-0220 </DOCNO><TEXT>The objective of the project was to investigate the possibility of modifyingmethane formation during the F-T synthesis independent from other hydrocarbonsby systematically changing catalyst characteristics. It would seem thatthe best way to decrease methane selectivity is still via the use ofcatalyst modifiers. In order to ``tailor-make``catalyst surfaces whichminimize ``extraeous`` methane synthesis without disrupting F-T synthesis,it is necessary for us to fully understand the mechanism(s) by whichsuch modifiers operate. An investigation of Fischer-Tropsch synthesison K- and Cl-modified Ru catalysts was carried out. The steady-steadyreaction results illustrate how chlorine enhances the selectivity ofmethane formation while potassium decreases it. In order to better understandmethane selectivity changes, a detailed study of Cl-modification of Rucatalysts was made. Ammonia synthesis and methanation reaction resultson the same series of catalysts (obtained by using the steady-state isotopictransient technique) in addition to the deactivation results for F-Tsuggest that structural rearrangements induced by the presence of chlorine,rather than selective site blocking or electronic interactions, may bethe primary mechanism of chlorine modification of supported rutheniumcatalysts. The results of this study indicate that catalyst modifiersmay act to change the catalytic properties by inducing certain metalsurface structures. This is a mechanism of modification which has, yet,not been addressed in detail. 49 refs., 16 figs., 7 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
