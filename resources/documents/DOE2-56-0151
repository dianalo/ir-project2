It is stressed that great care has to be used when applyingthe equations presented to real-life problems. A thorough knowledge ofthe groundwater/surface water system is required so to enable realisticestimates to be achieved. Analytical equations such as equivalent welland two-dimensional approaches provide quick first order estimates foruse in a field situation. The two-dimensional approach has been shownto give a slightly larger inflow for the same conditions as the equivalentwell method, thus a factor of safety is introduced. Numerical techniquesprovide powerful predictive tools able to model a number of scenariosefficiently. Consequently they are particularly valuable during minedesign. 19 refs., 10 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
