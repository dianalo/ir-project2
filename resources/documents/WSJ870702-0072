The bank holding company said the assets of Rainier Mortgage Co. being offered include a $2.8 billion residential-servicing portfolio and 25 mortgage-production offices in seven Western states.    In February, Los Angeles-based Security Pacific agreed to acquire Rainier for stock valued at $1.1 billion. But Rainer said the proposed sale of its mortgage unit's assets is unrelated to the acquisition, which is still pending.    For the first quarter, Rainier Mortgage had profit of $114,000, compared with a year-earlier loss of $681,000. The unit has been troubled in recent years by nonperforming assets and high foreclosure costs, but has been gradually recovering. Rainier Bancorp had profit of $17.3 million, or 78 cents a share, for the first quarter.    Rainier Bancorp previously tried to sell the unit, and said it was reviving the idea as part of a regular evaluation its businesses based on &quot;their contribution to overall profitability and their value in the marketplace.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
