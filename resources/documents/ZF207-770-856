(Special Section: Workstations)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Gillooly, Brian.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>The workstation market of the early 1990s will be characterized byrapid growth and intense competition for market share.andP;  Thecompetition will be between both vendors and technologies.andP;  Thecurrent market leaders, such as Sun Microsystems Inc, DEC,Hewlett-Packard Co and Silicon Graphics Inc, will be challenged byNext Inc, Data General Corp and Mips Computer Systems Inc. At thesame time many microcomputer vendors will compete for market sharewith their Intel 80x86 MSDOS-based,complex-instruction-set-computing microcomputers configured asworkstations.andP;  The definition of a workstation involves eitherCISC or reduced-instruction-set-computing (RISC) systems running aversion of the UNIX operating systems and equipped with advancedgraphics, large storage and networking capability.andP;  Sun's currentrange of 750 applications gives them an early edge in the low-endworkstation competition.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Market AnalysisWorkstationsMarket ShareVendorsCompetition.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
