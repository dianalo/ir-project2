The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm ofCongress, found that Army and Air Force maintenance depots, Navyshipyards and public work centers used money from the program onprojects ``inconsistent with the program's original intent.''   In some instances, administrative rules were not followed andthe facilities failed to keep adequate records, said Louis J.Rodrigues, a GAO official who testified before the Senate ArmedServices subcommittee on readiness, sustainability and support.   Earlier, Gen. Louis C. Wagner, Jr., commanding general of theU.S. Army Materiel Command, told the panel that due to a 1.5percent decline since fiscal 1987 in the budget for depotmaintenance, the purchase of spare and repair parts and militaryconstruction ``everything suffered, including readiness.''   ``We are living on the margin,'' Wagner said. ``The zero,actually negative, real growth in funding is causing us concernwith our ability to meet requirements. Readiness today is beingmaintained at the expense of sustainability during wartime.''   Gen. Alfred G. Hansen, commander of the Air Force LogisticsCommand, defined readiness as the ability to go to war andsustainability as keeping those forces equipped to fight over anextended period of time.   ``Sustainability has suffered the past three to four years,especially in spare parts,'' he said. ``Congress has taken outabout $700 million in sustainability in two years.''   The commanders cautioned against reductions in the defensebudget for depot maintenance, spare parts and other logistics.   Moments later, the GAO investigator described the problems hisagency has found with the program that enables depots and shipyardsto purchase equipment.   Congress had asked the GAO to review the Pentagon's AssetCapitalization Program, which has received about $5 billion fromfiscal 1983 to fiscal 1989.   Under the program, facilities such as depots and shipyards buyequipment with working capital funds rather than directappropriations. The program requires that a facility initiallyfinance the cost of the equipment and than charge its customers,such as fleet commanders and weapon systems managers, for the workperformed.   The facilities then recover the equipment cost by including thedepreciation expense in charges to its customers.   The GAO found that the Yorktown Weapons Station in Virginiabought an insect sprayer for $5,300 in 1984, used it about fivetimes in fiscal 1987 and not once since then. The sprayer was usedon areas near family housing and a golf course but had nothing todo with the ``mission'' of the weapons station.   At the Mare Island Shipyard near San Francisco, officials spent$150,000 on 24 vehicles for its tenants even though they knewPentagon rules prohibit the use of those funds on tenant activities.   ``Is this proper for government employees to do?'' Sen. CarlLevin, D-Mich., asked of the apparent violation of rules.   ``I don't think so,'' Rodrigues said.   The GAO official attributed the problems to ``limited or unclearguidance on how the (ACP program) should be managed.''   Specifically, the agency found that ``no central ACP office orcoordinator was responsible for managing and overseeing allequipment, minor construction and management information systemdevelopment projects.''   The Defense Department agreed that the program was ``not yet asound capital investment program,'' Rodrigues said. The departmentplans to take some action by the end of 1989, including naming asingle manager to oversee the program, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
