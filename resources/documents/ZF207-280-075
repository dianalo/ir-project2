todetermine where nerve damage has occured by laceration.andP;  The patient answers,with a &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no,&quot; or &quot;ouch!&quot;andM;This is medical multimedia, made possible by the Electric Cadaver, createdand developed by Dr.andP;  Stephen Freedman and Dr.andP;  Robert Chase at the StanfordUniversity Medical School.andP;  The Electric Cadaver is a media fusion ofgraphics, text, and images of the human body designed to aid medical studentsin their physiology lessons.andP;  Students can learn anatomy by scanning throughimages of bones, muscles, tendons, and internal organs.andP;  In addition toimages, there are textual explanations of concepts (such as bone development)and systems.andM;If a student wants to have a labeled diagram of the nerves in the hand, forexample, he can bring it up with a click of the mouse.andP;  There's alsoanimation to demonstrate how muscles and tendons work to bend and straightenthe finger.andM;Freedman himself de-emphasizes the terms multimedia and hypermedia in thedescription of his project.andP;  &quot;Those are buzzwords,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;The project isreally an electronic book.&quot;andP;  According to Freedman, The Electric Cadaver andprojects like it are merely the technological embodiment of something thathas been on for thousands of years -- the cross-referencing and synthesizingof information from many sources into one.andM;Dr.andP;  Chase is inerested in computers only insofar as they can help him teachmedicine.andP;  He sees the project as a learning tool that goes well beyondanatomy for medical students.andP;  &quot;Not only can students study the skeleton andinternal organs of the body,&quot; he says, &quot;but they can also learn the physicaleffects of nerve damage or the bone development of the hand from infancy to19 years.andP;  And at every point, text descriptions are just a clik away.&quot;andM;THE BARE BONESandM;The typical workstation includes a Mac II or SE; industrial laser-discplayer; a laser disc; a large-screen, high-resolution color monitor; andsoftware written in HyperCard.andP;  If you don't have access to the laser-discplayer, you can still work with a scaled-down version of the project usingjust the Mac SE or II and The Electric Cadaver software.andP;  Dr.andP;  Freedmanindicated that a CD-ROM version was also in the works.andM;The stack -- which contains many scanned images of anatomical systems alongwith textual information -- also acts as a video controller for approximately7,400 images on the laser disc, by tagging appropriate frames or sequencesdepicting high-quality still photography.andP;  Users can reverse, advance,fast-forward, scan, or just run through a sequence of related diagrams at theclick of a button.andP;  A mini-editor capability gives students the opportunityto make their own playlists (akin to placement of humbered bookmarks in abook) by arranging images in the order they want to present them.andM;Access for third-party developers' applications to The Electric Cadaver ismade possible by a custom tool box included with the stack.andP;  This tool boxcontains the pieces necessary to create entirely new access systems.andM;The stack itself is a port from an IBM HyperText version of the project,though you wouldn't know it.andP;  The stack is beautifully constructed, andthough it fails to resemble the Mac or even a traditional HyperCard interfacein places, it works smoothly and intuitively.andP;  If you have a Mac II, you cancall up high-resolution, digitized color images directly to the Macintoshmonitor.andP;  Getting these drawn, however, is a rather slow process (fiveseconds or so for an image to appear onscreen).andP;  Access to photos on thelaser disc is quick -- no more than two seconds in a worst cause, and usuallyalmost instantaneous.andM;EYE AM A CAMERAandM;Interestingly, the superlative photos on the laser disc were taken by BillGruber, the inventor of the View Master viewer.andP;  In photographing thedissections, Gruber used his three-dimensional camera system, using duallenses positioned at the average distance between human eyes.andP;  He hoped toshow that by studying three-dimensional images, students could train theireyes and brains in a manner superior to any two-dimensional system.andP;  Dr.andO;Chase imagines a day when the three-dimensional images themselves might beviewable from laser disc.andM;IS THERE A DOCTOR IN THE HOUSE?andM;While in medical school, Freedman noticed how he and his peers studied theirinformation -- reading and taking notes, synthesizing information frommultiple sources into a single form.andP;  He concluded that, in the course ofreadings and synthesis, medical students in effect write their own textbooks.andO;H e figured there had to be an easier way to synthesize information from asmany as ten books covering the same topic but conveying different pieces ofinformation.andM;After starting a company to publish electronic textbooks, Freedman met upwith Chase.andP;  By the time the two had developed a working model for TheElectric Cadaver project, Bill Atkinson had finished a prototype ofHyperCard.andP;  Although he originally used SmallTalk as the engine for TheElectric Cadaver, Freedman knew that he had to transfer the project over tothe Macintosh.andM;Freedman also points out that, because HyperCard is so widely distributed, itis a very attractive driver for multimedia projects.andP;  Freedman believes thatApple has done a great service for projects like The Electric Cadaver bypushing HyperCard and simplifying the process by which development takesplace.andM;Context SensitivityandM;TYPICALLY, A DEVELOPER BUILDS CONTEXT sensitivity into a system by creatinghot spots, points in a presentation or program where held screens can becalled up that are pertinent to the operation in question.andP;  In an interactivemultimedia project, context sensitivity has a broader utility: It's engine oftransmutation, the way information in one form is transmuted to informationin another.andP;  In the context of a video presentation, say, of an anatomylesson, the collar bone can be displayed concurrently with data; click on apart of the collar bone on-screen and a short, technical description couldappear.andP;  Other programs can use running text along with a videodiscpresentation: On a two-monitor system, you see the film running by on thevideo display, while commentary scrolls along with it on your Mac screen.andO;You stop the videodisc, click on an annotation button, and more informationcomes up on what you're viewing.andP;  In the digital world, sights become sounds,sounds become words, the word duck becomes a mallard flying accross yourscreen.andM;ExpertandM;SystemsandM;A GOOD EXPERT SYSTEM IS DESIGNED AS AN adjunct to, not a replacement of,human knowledge.andP;  What's more, in a multimedia project, it should encourageand not hinder interaction.andP;  In some future electronic newspaper, forexample, your expert system would know your likes, dislikes, and what youhabitually read, and it could help you sift out the rest.andP;  Or in aninteractive medical program, a knowledge base of previous diagnoses couldhelp doctors in the treatment of a rare disease.andP;  Doctors could x-ray thesuspect area and scan it onto a Mac.andP;  Then, they could work up an analysis ofthe examined area in a word processor.andP;  Using the image as an interactive&quot;template&quot; along with an authoring system, they could then paste hot spots onthe image as notes for the attending specialists and compare what they havefound with earlier X-rays of like symptoms, calling up texts of previous casehistories.andP;  Asking IF/THEN questions, based upon certain rules for inferenceand known constants based on a database of previous cases, doctors couldbuild prognoses with a greater probability of accuracy.andP;  On the basis of allthis, they could prescribe paths for treatment.andP;  In short, the interactiveproject, in conjunction with an expert system, would become anotherdiagnostic tool.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
