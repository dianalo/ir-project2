Then ``this completely crazy thing'' happened.   ``I coughed and a tiny, tiny blood clot took me to get a chestX-ray. Ten days later I had my lung removed.''   Trillin had lung cancer, the kind smokers get.   But she had never smoked a cigarette.   The cause of her cancer remained a mystery until a doctor friendasked if her parents had smoked. Yes, Trillin told him, they smokedheavily.   ``Nobody had ever said anything about passive smoking. I hadn'tworried about the question much,'' she says.   Most scientists hadn't worried about the question much either,until studies in recent years showed that passive smoking wascausing 3,000 to 5,000 lung cancer deaths a year in non-smokers. Nowa study estimates that the toll from passive smoking, includingdeaths from heart disease and other cancers, may be 10 times that.   Tobacco smoke in the home and workplace could be killing 46,000non-smokers each year in the United States, the study concludes.That's 3,000 lung cancer deaths, 11,000 from other cancers and32,000 heart disease deaths.   That would make passive smoking the leading preventable cause ofdeath after alcohol and smoking itself, said Dr. Ronald M. Davis,director of the U.S. Office on Smoking and Health. Smoking kills390,000; alcohol, 120,000.   ``No longer are we talking about runny nose or watery eyes orheadache or nausea, but a fatal disease,'' said Davis. ``Which upsthe ante, so to speak, for passive smoking.''   Passive smoking has become the principal battleground for thetobacco industry and its opponents in the 1980s. It is no longermerely a health issue, but political and environmental. Cigarettepollution is fouling the air.   ``We know that the indoor environment is far more polluted thanthe outdoor environment,'' said James Repace of the EnvironmentalProtection Agency indoor air program. ``We've seen that again andagain wherever we've looked all over the United States.''   Many people believe smokers have the right to smoke. But theyalso believe that others shouldn't have to pay a price.   ``When you talk about an involuntary risk, the society becomesmuch more cautious,'' said University of California-San Franciscobiomedical engineer Stanton Glantz, an environmentalist andanti-smoking activist.   The new estimate is controversial. Researchers agree it ispreliminary and needs to be confirmed.   A tobacco industry consultant said the emphasis on passivesmoking was misplaced. ``Environmental tobacco smoke is asmokescreen that is keeping us from looking at the total problem,which is the quality of indoor air,'' said Dr. David Weeks,president of Per-Med Corp., a health consulting firm in Boise,Idaho. ``You take the tobacco smoke out of the air and you've stillgot the problem.''   Many public health officials disagree.   The risk of tobacco smoke ``is greater than the risk of radon gasis to non-smokers,'' said Repace. ``We're talking maybe 40 percentgreater. And if you're talking about all the carcinogenic airpollutants that EPA regulates, it's 100 times greater.''   EPA researchers in North Carolina say in a new internal reportthat environmental tobacco smoke ``is a major source of indoor airpollution and is also the major combustion source contributing tototal human exposure to mutagens and carcinogens.''   The passive smoking issue poses a serious threat to the tobaccoindustry. A confidential opinion poll done for the industry in 1978,and leaked to anti-smoking activists, showed passive smoking was``the most dangerous development to the viability of the tobaccoindustry that has yet occurred.''   ``What the smoker does to himself may be his business, but whatthe smoker does to the non-smoker is quite a different matter,'' thepollsters concluded.   Concern about passive smoking escalated in 1986 with two reports:The U.S. Surgeon General concluded that passive smoking doesn'tmerely raise the risk of lung cancer _ it causes it. And theNational Academy of Sciences said exposure to tobacco smoke mayraise the risk of lung cancer in non-smokers 34 percent.   Alice Trillin was lucky; she was cured. But lung cancer remainsone of the most difficult cancers to treat. Few others will have herluck.   The link between passive smoking and lung cancer is based on fourlines of evidence, said Davis, whose Office on Smoking and Healthprepares the Surgeon General's reports on smoking.   First, tobacco smoke contains known cancer-causing agents.Second, non-smokers absorb smoke from the air; by-products can bemeasured in their blood. Third, there's no safe level of exposure tosmoke. Fourth, many studies show that non-smokers whose spousessmoke have a higher risk of lung cancer than non-smokers whosespouses don't.   At the end of 1987, 42 states had imposed some restrictions onsmoking in public, more than double the number in the early 1970s,said Davis. Thirty-two states restrict smoking in the workplace.   The nation's two largest air-quality agencies, the EPA and theCalifornia Air Resources Board, are preparing assessments of thedanger of passive smoking. Both have included the new estimate intheir calculations.   The estimate comes from a study published in the December issueof Environment International by A. Judson Wells, a researcher inWilmington, Del., and a volunteer with the American Lung Association.   ``In general, we don't think Dr. Wells is going to be off base atall,'' said Margaret Jenkins, coordinator of the indoor air qualityprogram for the California Air Resources Board.   The paper's findings on lung cancer agree with other studies; itsfindings on heart disease and other cancers are more speculative,but plausible, Repace said. ``The largest source of death fromactive smoking is, of course, heart disease. We know the arteries ofsmokers get plugged up very rapidly, and it is very possible thatthese same effects could occur in passive smokers.''   Wells said he himself was surprised by his estimate. ``When Ifirst calculated these numbers, they scared the hell out of me. I'dbe the first to admit they're wrong, if we can find out why they'rewrong.''   So far, no one has, although not everyone accepts Wells' estimate.   Weeks, the industry consultant, dismissed Wells' study, as hedoes concern about passive smoking altogether. He believes passivesmoking causes no risk, but he doesn't think any of the data on thesubject are very good.   Many researchers would agree that current estimates are imprecise.   But Repace answers Weeks this way: ``Environmental tobacco smokeis tobacco smoke. And tobacco smoke is known to cause 400,000 deathsa year. Here is a known carcinogen to human beings. Are we to assumethat low levels are innocuous? The question is, what standard ofproof you require before you take public action?''   The risk to a non-smoker in a typical office is about the same asthe risk for a non-smoker whose spouse smokes, he said. ``In atypical office with good ventilation, you're running about 250 timesthe maximum acceptable cancer risk for environmental carcinogens inair or water or food.''   That is, among 100,000 workers, you'd expect 250 of them to diefrom lung cancer caused by passive smoking. ``And in the poorlyventilated office, it would be four times as high,'' Repace said.   Occasional exposure in a bar, restaurant or car probably is notnearly as great a risk as exposure in the home or the office, hesaid.   Most of the regulatory emphasis now is on curbing smoke in theworkplace. ``It's one of the two most important places of exposureto tobacco smoke, the other being the home,'' Davis said. ``Forsomebody who doesn't have any smokers in the home, the worksitewould be the most important place.''   Even many smokers favor policies that curb the passive smokingrisk.   According to the 1989 Surgeon General's report on smoking, 64percent of smokers believe their habit is hazardous to non-smokers'health. Thirty-four percent of smokers were bothered by otherpeople's smoking.   The question for non-smokers is how aggressively to avoid tobaccosmoke.   ``I'm sure one day's exposure isn't going to do you any harm,''said Wells. ``But every little bit adds to what you've accumulatedheretofore.   ``Only the most sensitive individuals are going to die of passivesmoking. The problem is we don't know who they are. It could be you.It could be me.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for June 19</NOTE></DOC>
