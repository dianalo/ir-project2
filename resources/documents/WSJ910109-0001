But Cook County Circuit Judge Robert Sklodowski limitedthe scope of the ruling by finding that only those policiesin effect when the asbestos was discovered would apply. USGhad hoped to receive coverage from the time the asbestos wasactually installed.</LP><TEXT>   Disputes over coverage are emerging as a significant issuein a number of asbestos cases around the country. Whilecourts are split on whether insurers are liable, most haveagreed with the Cook County court on which policies are ineffect.   The latest ruling, issued from the bench, is part of alengthy dispute between U.S. Gypsum and its carriers over thecompany's right to be defended and reimbursed by insurers invarious asbestos-related property damage cases broughtagainst it.   USG, a unit of USG Corp. in Chicago, makes buildingproducts. From the early 1930s until the 1970s, it madeseveral products containing asbestos fibers. Now the companyis facing hundreds of suits by building owners who say thatover the years asbestos fibers were released into theatmosphere, allegedly contaminating the buildings andcreating a health hazard. Two hundred such cases are pending.USG has won nine cases at trial, lost seven, and settled 29.   In the ruling, Judge Sklodowski said that USG was entitledto approximately $6 million it spent on settlements and juryverdicts in eight property damage cases. But he said thatcoverage would be limited to policies in effect when thebuilding owners first became aware of the presence ofasbestos. Lawyers for the insurers said that restrictionmeans that the insurers' liability is drastically limited andthat USG's coverage will be cut off in the near future.   &quot;USG will have no insurance coverage for claims where theasbestos was not discovered until after 1984,&quot; said Sandra D.Oliszewicz, a Chicago lawyer representing two of thecarriers. None of the insurers covered such liability afterthat year, she said. She said her clients are still studyingthe ruling and haven't yet determined whether they willappeal.   A spokesman for USG said the company was pleased with themajority of the court's findings. The spokesman said thecompany is still studying the ruling to determine whether toappeal.   ---   SECURITY PACIFIC seeks share of Marcos propertysettlement.   Litigation over four Manhattan buildings was settled lastmonth between the Philippines and other parties claimingownership. But Security Pacific National Bank has asked thefederal court in Manhattan to give it a part of the estimated$11 million settlement.   Under the settlement, the money will be divided among thePhilippines; the properties' managers, Joseph and RalphBernstein; and Karl Peterson, an attorney who works for Saudibusinessman Adnan Khashoggi.   The Philippines in 1986 accused Ferdinand Marcos and hiswife, Imelda, of secretly buying and maintaining thebuildings with $160 million stolen from the country. Mr.Marcos, who was ousted as Philippine president in 1986, diedin 1989, and Mrs. Marcos was cleared of any wrongdoing in thetransactions at a criminal trial last year.   Security Pacific claims it was cheated out of $130 millionin loans in an alleged fraud by the Bernsteins and Mr.Peterson. The Security Pacific Corp. unit told the court thatit wouldn't have granted the loans if information hadn't beenwithheld about the buildings. The companies defaulted on theloans, the bank said, &quot;because {of} years of looting andmismanagement.&quot;   &quot;We never did anything wrong. There's been no looting,&quot;Joseph Bernstein said. He said Security Pacific was &quot;tryingto worm into the money.&quot; An attorney for Mr. Petersoncouldn't be reached for comment.   In court documents, the Philippines said the bank isn'tentitled to the money because it wasn't a party to thelitigation. The bank has been paid $25 million from theforeclosure sale of one of the buildings.   U.S. District Judge Pierre Leval, who is overseeing thesettlement, ordered Security Pacific to show why thesettlement shouldn't be paid.   ---   MONOPOLY MAKER takes localized version of board game tocourt.   Parker Brothers has accused the makers of CityOpoly --which puts real city streets on what looks like a Monopolyboard -- of trademark infringement. The Tonka Corp. unitfiled the lawsuit in federal court in Manhattan.   In each local version -- such as Las Vegasopoly andBaltimoreopoly -- local businesses are sold spots on the gameboard, and the game is then sold by retailers in the city.The game is made by Elusive Dream Marketing Service, of ElCajon, Calif.   In its lawsuit, Parker said the games &quot;simulate virtuallyevery distinctive trade dress feature&quot; of Monopoly. Otherdefendants in the lawsuit are Saks Fifth Avenue and F.A.O.Schwarz, two New York retailers accused of selling BigAppleopoly, the Manhattan version.   Arthur Mitchell, vice president of Elusive Dream, said hebelieves the CityOpoly games are distinctive enough not toviolate the Monopoly trademark. He said the game boardsinclude pictures of local landmarks and the board spaces havebeen renamed. Also, he said, &quot;`Opoly' is a generic suffix. Wedon't use the word monopoly at all.&quot;   ---   SEX BIAS SUIT against Unisys allowed to go forward.   A federal judge in Philadelphia ruled that the plaintiff,Linda S. Borton, can pursue her claim of sex discriminationarising from a photo taken of her during a Unisys Corp.function. The judge, however, threw out some related claimsunder state law, including intentional infliction ofemotional distress and several counts of invasion of privacy.   The suit contends that Ms. Borton, a midlevel salesmanager, attended a sales conference in July 1989 thatincluded an evening boat ride during which employees werephotographed informally. Without Ms. Borton's knowledge, aphoto that Ms. Borton considered embarrassing was lateroffered &quot;as lunchtime entertainment&quot; during a companyslide-show put together by Unisys' director of marketingcommunications, according to the suit.   A lawyer and a spokesman for Unisys, based in Blue Bell,Pa., said had they hadn't seen the opinion and couldn'tcomment.   U.S. District Judge Thomas N. O'Neill Jr. ruled that Ms.Borton can sue on grounds that the incident was part of analleged pattern of sexual discrimination and harassmentexperienced by Ms. Borton at Unisys. But the judge dismisseda claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress,because the facts did not meet the legal test of&quot;outrageousness.&quot;   To pass that test in Pennsylvania, plaintiffs must showthat an employer both engaged in sexual harassment andretaliated when rebuffed.   ---   HEART VALVE is focus of class-action lawsuit.   The suit was filed yesterday in federal court in LosAngeles against Pfizer Inc. and a subsidiary on behalf ofmore than 55,000 recipients of the Bjork-ShileyConvexo-Concave heart valve implant.
