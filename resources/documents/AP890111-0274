Giuliani's resignationcomes at a sensitive time in the Wall Street crime crackdown he hasorchestrated, with at least a half-dozen major cases unresolved andgrowing criticism of his strong-arm tactics by defense lawyers.   Giuliani's temporary successor Benito Romano sought to minimizethe impact of his departure, particularly on the outstanding fraudprosecutions. ``I think we're just beginning to see ... thesubstantial insider trading and other securities cases,'' Romanosaid Wednesday.   Nonetheless, Giuliani's resignation announcement a day earliercoincided with an embarrasing goof by subordinates that triggered amistrial in the first case to reach a jury, the stock manipulationindictment of chemical company GAF Corp. and one of its topofficials.   Moreover, the case against junk-bond giant Drexel Burnham LambertInc., though ostensibly settled, still hasn't been finalized, andthe other shoe has yet to drop for Drexel's top financier MichaelMilken, who is expected to be indicted.   The prosecutors have pushed back an indictment deadline severaltimes for John Mulheren, a securities executive accused of plottingto assassinate convicted speculator Ivan Boesky with a loadedassault rifle. The latest deadline is Feb. 12, nearly a year afterpolice arrested Mulheren outside his home.   Although Giuliani's record is impressive _ including Boesky'sconviction and cooperation _ critics contend his love affair withtelevision cameras, political ambitions and a penchant forinflexibility have led his office to prosecute some fraud caseswithout enough evidence.   The most remarkable and embarassing example thus far was theheadline-grabbing handcuff arrests and indictment of three prominentbrokers in February 1987 for securities fraud. A few months laterGiuliani had to drop the indictment and promised another. His officestill hasn't brought it.   To be sure, Giuliani will be widely remembered as one of the mostvigorous prosecutors on Wall Street. During his tenure, he broughtseveral important white-collar felons to justice, particularlyBoesky and former investment banker Dennis B. Levine.   He extracted cooperation from other implicated brokers, won a$25.3 million settlement from Kidder Peabody Group Inc. and morerecently negotiated a record $650 million criminal plea-bargainagreement with Drexel, though final details are still undernegotiation.   ``Anybody would have to say his performance as a prosecutor waseffective,'' said Arthur Liman, a leading attorney who representsMilken and GAF in the securities fraud prosecutions.   But a key part of the Giuliani strategy has been his increasinglycriticized use of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizationslaw as a pressure tactic against Drexel and others who have resistedhim.   The racketeering law, known as the RICO act, originally was meantto fight violent gangsters, pushers and pimps. It allows thegovernment to seize a suspect's assets before trial and provides forcrippling penalties upon conviction.   Many lawyers say privately that Drexel's fear of the racketeeringact led it to settle charges Dec. 21 that hadn't even been formallyfiled. The prospect that the government could seize hundreds ofmillions of dollars in assets and taint Drexel as a racketeer wasevidently too much for the firm's top directors.   The awesome power of the racketeering statute was demonstrated toDrexel earlier in the month when a smaller securities firm wasforced into liquidation because its partners faced a racketeeringindictment brought by Giuliani's office.   ``Nobody in the world dreamed this would be used againstsecurities firms,'' said John S. Stoppelman, a Washington attorney.   ``When you put it in the hands of an aggresive prosecutor withpolitical ambitions, we're back in the Star Chamber,'' he said.``We're back to the abuses we were trying to correct in the Englishsystem.''   In Giuliani's view, Stoppelman said, the approach towardsecurities fraud suspects smacks of presumed guilt, an easypunishment if you cooperate and a devastating demise if you don't.   ``They say, `We'll be nice to you. You play tennis in Lompoc(minimum security prison) and you testify against this bigbanana,''' he said.   On the other hand, ``When they say, `We're gonna use RICO, we'regoing to put the squeeze on you.' That's like saying, `We're goingto use the A-bomb.'''</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Rick Gladstone covers insider trading andsecurities fraud for The Associated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
