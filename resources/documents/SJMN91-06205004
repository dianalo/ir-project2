Some operations and routes would be splitbetween them. Two weeks ago Delta Air Lines offered $260 million for theshuttle and other assets of Pan Am, which is operating under bankruptcyprotection. The bid won the preliminary endorsement of Pan Am management. Butthe offer, more limited than the TWA-American bid, has triggered a new biddingwar for Pan Am's most valuable assets. Pan Am officials declined to comment onthe latest offer. Most analysts predicted that Delta would probably prevail,but only after raising the ante.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  TWA JOINS AMERICAN IN BIDDING FOR PAN AM  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Financial Digest  </MEMO><BYLINE>  Mercury News Staff and Wire Reports  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910723  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  122  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday July 23, 199100205004,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
