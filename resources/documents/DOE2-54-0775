Implementation ofthis policy is in progress. This policy, aided by a related safety goalpolicy and by analysis capabilities emerging from improved understandingof accident phenomenology, is viewed as a logical development from thepioneering work in the WASH-1400 Reactor Safety Study published by theUnited States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in 1975. This workprovided an estimate of the probability and consequences of severe accidentswhich, prior to that time, had been mostly evaluated by somewhat arbitraryassumptions dating back 30 years. The early history of severe accidentevaluation is briefly summarized for the period 1957-1979. Then, thegalvanizing action of Three Mile Island Unit 2 (TMI-2) on severe accidentanalysis, experimentation and regulation is reviewed. Expressions ofUS policy in the form of rulemaking, severe accident policy, safety research,safety goal policy and court decisions (on adequacy of safety) are discussed.Finally, the NRC policy as of March 1988 is stated, along with a prospectivelook at the next few years.
