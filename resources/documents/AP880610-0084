(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   People who make money by making babiescould be put behind bars under a bill approved by the MichiganLegislature.   Legislation outlawing pregnancy-for-pay contracts was approvedThursday on a 90-10 House vote and 28-3 Senate vote.   ``After five years, in probably the state that was mostdifficult to pass a surrogate act, it's a real victory,'' saidRepublican Sen. Connie Binsfeld, the bill's sponsor.   The bill goes to Gov. James Blanchard, who will have 14 days toveto, sign or let it automatically become law. Blanchard's chieflobbyist, William Kandler, said he didn't know what Blanchard woulddo.   Michigan is an important target for surrogacy opponents becauseit is home to one of the nation's most prolific surrogacymatchmakers. Lawyer Noel Keane of Dearborn says he has arrangedmore than 200 births, including the Mary Beth Whitehead pregnancythat led to New Jersey's landmark ``Baby M'' case. In that case,the state Supreme Court outlawed surrogacy for pay.   Keane maintains those cases are the rare exception and that mostpeople involved in surrogate arrangements are very happy with theresults.   Typically, an infertile couple pays Keane $10,000 to match themwith a woman willing to be artificially inseminated, carry a childto term and give up her parental rights. The woman also is paid$10,000.   Under the proposed Michigan law, no such payments could changehands, although a woman who entered into an unenforceable surrogacyagreement could be compensated for her expenses.   Brokers who arrange surrogate births for profit would facefelony penalties of up to five years in prison and a $50,000 fine.People who enter into such contracts would face misdemeanor chargespunishable by up to a year and $10,000.   Binsfeld said the bill also would ban a contracting couple fromgiving such women any gifts.   Women still could become surrogates for free _ for example, if asister wanted to carry a child for her infertile sibling.   The legislation would guarantee that in the case of a surrogacycustody dispute, the baby would remain with its mother until acircuit judge determined whether it was in the child's bestinterest to give custody to the father.   Binsfeld called the measure ``the only answer to protectchildren.''   ``I don't think adults should be able to fulfill their desiresat the expense of children,'' she said.   Lawmakers who voted against the bill said the Legislatureprobably hasn't settled anything.   ``Surrogacy is not going to end _ it may be forcedunderground,'' said Democratic Rep. Floyd Clack, who predictedlawmakers within the next two years will be asked to come up withdifferent regulations.   ``Women who become surrogate mothers are entitled to be paid fortheir services, just like male athletes who risk their bodies arepaid,'' said Republican Rep. David Honigman, head of a specialcommittee that examined the issue.   Honigman agreed that people who want a standard surrogatearrangement will be able to enter one. ``Most people are going togo out of state, of course,'' he said.   Kentucky, Louisiana and Nebraska have enacted laws declaringsurrogate arrangements illegal. Indiana put enforcement ofsurrogate contracts on hold until the issue can be researched, andproposed surrogacy regulations were vetoed in Arkansas, accordingto the National Conference of State Legislatures.</TEXT></DOC>
