(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Falling oil prices and tough newenvironmental regulations have Don Taylor producing oil like abootlegger working a still.   ``We're running illegal,'' says Taylor, a short, stocky man whofiercely protects his 150 oil wells from inquisitive stateofficials.   ``Every time my black lab barks, I look to see whether it's thelaw. It's just like moonshining. But what choice do we have?''   Taylor refuses to register his wells with state authorities.``If they have a problem,'' he says, ``they should know where theproblem is.'' So far he's managed to avoid investigators because ofspotty enforcement and legal challenges to the new regulations.   ``It's not a matter of being a hero or a smart aleck,'' he says,referring to his candor. ``It's just a matter of trying tosurvive.''   Defiance is not uncommon among small producers in this, theoldest oil and gas field in the world. Here the first oil well wasdrilled in 1859 and the first gas well in 1868.   Operating on the shady side of the law may mean the differencebetween making a living and going bankrupt, says Taylor. Heestimates it would cost him about $100,000 to be ``legal.''   Complying with state regulations, which include a $25,000 bondand expensive rules for discharging brine and plugging unusedwells, may cost more than the $5-a-day revenues realized from theaverage oil well and $8 a day from the average gas well inPennsylvania.   The regulations probably would have gone down easier had theynot accompanied the worst price collapse in the history of theenergy industry _ a collapse that has hurt the nation's other 32oil and gas producing states as well.   ``This has been the worst depression in the oil industry sincethe 1930s,'' says Ron Harris, spokesman for the IndependentPetroleum Association of America, which represents 7,000independent oil and gas producers.   ``A lot of independents are struggling.''   About 20 miles away, near the village of Knox, Dwight Stovermaneuvers his four-wheel-drive pickup up a steep, rutted trail tocheck for the last time on wells that have been oozing fuel aspredictably as Old Faithful for almost 100 years.   In this pristine setting, populated by wild turkeys, deer, blackbear and grouse, forests of hemlocks and mountain laurel camouflageone of the most densely developed natural gas areas in the state.   Many of the wells are still flowing, although at low volumes,kept alive by thousands of small operators like Taylor and Stover.   Small producers started the oil and gas industry more than 120years ago. They're the wildcatters who explored new oil fields,drilled new gas wells and resurrected abandoned sites. And even inthese times of multinational conglomerates, their low-volume wells,called stripper wells, still make up three-quarters of the nation'stotal.   ``You can't afford to drill a new well to get 10 gallons of oila day. But if you can sell 10 gallons of oil at a decent price, youcan pump that well indefinitely,'' says Stover, a trim man of 54who's been producing gas for 20 years.   But while the world's appetite for gas and oil continues togrow, a host of problems, including rock-bottom prices, stringentenvironmental regulations, Arab oil and restricted pipelines, haveforced the grandchildren of the energy pioneers out of business.   ``You know, everybody would like to own an oil well. Everybodythinks that all you need is an oil well to be rich. But that's thefarthest thing from the truth,'' said Stover. He recently turnedoff his 97 gas wells after his main customer, a glass plant, wentout of business.   ``Three years ago I had an offer of $750,000 for my wells.Today, I don't think I could give them away.''   In 1986, U.S. crude oil dropped to $10 a barrel from a March1981 high of $34.70, according to the Independent PetroleumAssociation of America.   Currently prices hover around $14.25 a barrel for U.S. crude and$16 for Pennsylvania Grade crude, a paraffin-based oil prized forits lubricating qualities.   For the state's stripper wells, which average one-third a barrelper day, or 14 gallons, the yield is about $5 a day, a mere drop inthe bucket compared to the 200 barrels daily produced by a typicalmedium-sized oil well in Texas or Oklahoma.   ``Legislators think in barrels, and we talk gallons. That's whyit takes so many wells to survive,'' says Taylor, 45, who ownsseveral 100-year-old wells.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
