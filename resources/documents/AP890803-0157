The decision by the local guerrilla force to join the governmentmarked a gain for President Najib's program of nationalreconciliation to end the decade-old civil war.   But amid the festivities and show of arms there was a noisyreminder that the war goes on: a rocket exploded behind a clump oftrees 1,500 feet from the crowd, sending up a cloud of brown smokeas the official ceremony started.   A few government soldiers disappeared but the speeches went onand the former guerrillas, defectors from theHarkat-e-Enquelab-e-Islami fundamentalist group led by MaulviMohammad Nabi Mohammadi, were welcomed into the government fold.   The Harkat guerrillas already had a three-year informalcease-fire with the Soviet-backed government. So the officialreconciliation was one of warm embraces and good food _ rocket orno rocket.   Hayat Ullah, eldest son of faction commander Ibrahim Beg, blamedthe rival Jamiat-e-Islami for the rocket.   Beg, sitting cross-legged in the mosque of this tiny town 250miles west of Kabul, said he lost only ``a few'' men in fightingagainst the government. But he said between 200 and 250 of hisfighters have died in clashes with rival guerrilla groups, mainlyJamiat and hard-line fundamentalist Gulbaddin Hekmatyar'sHezb-e-Islami.   He said he has 21,000 supporters, including 900 armed fighters.Without informing Mohammadi, Beg said, they decided to join thegovernment after the Feb. 15 withdrawal of the last Soviet troopsin the belief Najib's administration is ``the people'sgovernment,'' not one of infidels.   ``First, we face shortages of food. Then, we don't have enoughweapons to fight with other groups. So with the cooperation of thegovernment, we will fight against those who do not believe innational reconciliation,'' Beg said.   The guerrillas, some unarmed but about half wearing rifles,lined up with their heavy weapons, including a rocket-propelledgrenade launcher and two anti-aircraft guns.   Under the agreement, they keep their weapons and will getadditional ones. One of Beg's younger sons was given fiveKalashnikovs when he and his men marched down the hills into town,and the town itself received 10 tons of flour and the promise ofmore to come.   Government officials also gave the guerrillas money, butjournalists were unable to find out how much.   Afghan government forces have their headquarters in theprovincial capital of Chagcharan, 25 miles away, but Hayat Ullahsaid no troops came to Taghai Timur until four days ago, when theguerrillas announced they were ready to join the government.   The town is in Ghowr, one of Afghanistan's poorest provinces,whose 250,000 people survive by raising sheep, cattle and wheat.   Several villagers said the journalists were the first Westernersthey have seen.   Reporters watched locals in colorful turbans and baggy pantsslaughtering sheep, which a government spokesman described as atraditional sign of reconciliation.   Ranking army officers and provincial officials exchanged hugsand some kisses with waiting guerrillas.   At a traditional feast of roasted sheep, rice, yogurt and flatnan bread, some of Beg's followers asked journalists why theAmericans still supply weapons to the guerrillas.   ``If the United States, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia stop militaryassistance, the war will finish in a few days,'' said Aji MohammadYaqub, a bearded man of about 50 who said he has lost 50 friendsand relatives in the war.   A deputy minister for state security who identified himself asLt. Gen. Jalal said that in the past month, 5,000 armed guerrillasand 10,000 of their unarmed supporters have joined the government.   He estimated more than 200,000 guerrillas are in Afghanistan,but said about 70 percent are not fighting.   This figure matched an estimate by Peter Tomsen, a special U.S.envoy to the guerrillas. But Tomsen has predicted Najib'sSoviet-backed government will fall and ``the resistance willprevail.''   Afghan officials point out they have weathered the Sovietwithdrawal in February, despite similar predictions the guerrillaswould oust them then.</TEXT></DOC>
