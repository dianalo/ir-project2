<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-42-1025 </DOCNO><TEXT>This report documents the conceptual design and analysis of a solar thermalfree-piston Stirling hydraulic engine system designed to deliver 25 kWewhen coupled to the 11-meter Test Bed Concentrator at Sandia NationalLaboratories. A manufacturing cost assessment for 10,000 units per yearwas made by Pioneer Engineering and Manufacturing. The design meets allprogram objectives including a 60,000-hr design life, dynamic balancing,fully automated control, andgt;33.3% overall system efficiency, properly conditionedpower, maximum utilization of annualized insolation, and projected productioncosts of $300/kW. The system incorporates a simple, rugged, reliablepool boiler reflux heat pipe to transfer heat from the solar receiverto the Stirling engine. The free-piston engine produces high-pressurehydraulic flow which powers a commercial hydraulic motor that, in turn,drives a commercial rotary induction generator. The Stirling hydraulicengine uses hermetic bellows seals to separate helium working gas fromhydraulic fluid which provides hydrodynamic lubrication to all movingparts. Maximum utilization of highly refined, field proven commercialcomponents for electric power generation minimizes development cost andrisk. The engine design is based on a highly refined Stirling hydraulicengine developed over 20 years as a fully implantable artificial heartpower source. 4 refs., 19 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
