Acommonly used statistic to measure the level of incomeinequality is the Gini index or index of incomeconcentration. . . . {T}he Gini index has grown slightly overthe past two decades. . . . Between 1979 and 1989 the Giniindex grew by 6.7 percent. Over the 1969-79 period the Giniindex grew by 3.3 percent. Thus, the 1979-89 change was abouttwice as large as the change between 1969 and 1979. . . .   Another measure of income inequality is the share ofaggregate income that is received by each quintile of thepopulation. . . . {I}n 1989 the share of aggregate incomereceived by the highest quintile of households was 46.8percent, no higher than in 1988, though significantly higherthan the comparable figures for 1979 and 1969 (44.2 and 43.0percent, respectively). This change was accompanied bysomewhat lower shares of aggregate income going to the lowestand the middle three quintiles.   While there seems little doubt that the incomedistribution has become somewhat less equal over the past 20years, the reasons for this trend are not as clear.Certainly, part of the growing inequality of the incomedistribution can be attributed to the changing composition offamilies and households. One of the compositional changes isthe growth in the elderly population. In March of 1990, 21.6percent of all households had a householder 65 years old orolder. The comparable figure for 1970 was 19.3 percent. Sinceelderly households have considerably lower incomes thannonelderly households (in 1989 the ratio of elderly tononelderly median household income was .48), thiscompositional change would tend to increase incomeinequality.   Another compositional change is the growing number ofpersons living in nonfamily situations (those who live eitheralone or with nonrelatives). In 1970, 18.7 percent ofhouseholds had a householder either living alone or withnonrelatives. By 1990, that figure grew to 29.2 percent.Since these households have a much lower median income thanfamily households ($17,120 versus $34,630 in 1989), theirincrease would certainly have an effect on the inequality ofthe household income distribution.   A trend that is associated with the increasing inequalityof the family income distribution is the growing percentageof families with a female householder, no husband present.Between 1970 and 1990, families with a female householder, nohusband present grew from 10.8 percent of all families to16.5 percent. Data from the CPS show that about one-half ofall families with a female householder, no husband presentwere in the lowest income quintile. The increase in this typeof family would cause an increase in measured incomeinequality.   Other factors may be associated with the growinginequality of the income distribution, including the aging ofthe &quot;babyboom&quot; generation, the growth in the labor forceparticipation of women, and the changing occupationalstructure. Understanding the reasons behind the growth inincome inequality would require estimating the separateeffects of each of the factors noted above (and perhapsothers) on this phenomenon.   {footnote}: It should be noted that the figures in thisreport refer only to changes in the income distribution priorto the inclusion of taxes or the value of noncash benefits.For information on the effect of taxes and benefits on incomeinequality, see Current Population Reports, Series P60, No.169-RD, &quot;Measuring the Effect of Benefits and Taxes on Incomeand Poverty: 1989.&quot;   ---   From report No. 169:   -- The use of a fully adjusted income definition, that is,one that includes the effect of taxes, cash and noncashbenefits, capital gains, employee health benefits, and netreturn on home equity results in a more equal distribution ofincome than under the official money income definition.   -- It has long been known that both taxes and transfershave an equalizing effect on the distribution of income. Oneof the important findings of the Bureau's tax and benefitresearch is that the effect of government transfers is muchmore significant than taxes in redistributing income.</TEXT></DOC>
