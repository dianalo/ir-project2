The fire killed 25 poultry-plant workers, many of whomfound outside doors locked, and &quot;dramatically illustrates thefact that North Carolina is grossly delinquent&quot; in protectionfor the state's workers, said Margaret Seminario, the AFL-CIOdirector of occupational safety and health.</LP><TEXT>   North Carolina is one of 25 states and U.S. territoriesthat regulate workplace health and safety under plansapproved by the federal Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration, a Labor Department unit. Two of those statesregulate state and local government workers, with the federalagency covering private companies. The agency could reclaimauthority if it feels such action is justified.   Ms. Seminario asked OSHA to withdraw the approval forNorth Carolina and assume direct regulatory authority. Shesaid the Imperial Food plant had never been inspected by thestate job-safety agency in the plant's 11 years of operation,even though the poultry industry's injury and illness rateput the plant in the &quot;high-hazard&quot; category.   The day after the Hamlet fire, Labor Secretary Lynn Martinbegan a review of all state job-safety plans. The agency willcomplete that review before finishing any full-scaleconsideration of the AFL-CIO petition, an OSHA spokesmansaid.   Although staffing levels set when the state plan wasapproved in 1985 were reduced from a 1980 &quot;benchmark&quot; level,North Carolina lags well behind even the 1985 levels forinspectors. Its inspection force has fallen as the number ofestablishments increased, and some of its inspectors aretrainees, Ms. Seminario said.   Among other failings, North Carolina conducted only 100general safety inspections last year. At that rate,high-hazard manufacturers would be inspected once every 30years, instead of the once every two years called for underthe 1985 calculations, Ms. Seminario said. In 1990, fivegeneral health inspections were performed among the state's1,854 high-hazard manufacturers, she added.</TEXT></DOC>
