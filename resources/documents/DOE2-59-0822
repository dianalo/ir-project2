Short-term cost savings could be made from currentlow oil prices by the utilization of dual-fired plant and oil plant.If one quarter of such plants in the West were returned into service,then 45 mt of coal would be threatened (5% of current coal burn). Gasposes a more serious, longer term threat to coal, even though it is amore expensive fuel, as it is able to generate power more cheaply thancoal. The gas turbine combined cycle plant can produce power at a cost15% lower than that from conventional coal plant and also has the advantagesof: low capital costs, relatively short construction period, low operatingcosts, and an acceptable level of gaseous emissions. It is thought thatby 2010, Europe could displace around 60 mt of coal with gas. 2 figs.,3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
