PHONE PORN      The court refused to let Congress totally outlaw thebillion-dollar ``dial-a-porn'' industry, rejecting arguments thatsuch a ban is needed to protect the nation's children from merely``indecent'' messages.   The justices unanimously said Congress was not justified when itpassed a law last year banning all sexually explicit telephonedial-up message services.   Congress may outlaw obscene telephone messages only, not indecentones, the court said. The dial-a-porn industry therefore must beallowed to survive, it said.   The cases are Sable Communications v. FCC, 88-515, and FCC vs.Sable Communications, 88-525.      DEATH ROW      The court ruled that states are not required by the Constitutionto provide free lawyers for death row inmates who lost an initialround of appeals.
