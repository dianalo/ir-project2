Only one of the four cars of highly flammable butane that caughtfire Sunday night was burning shortly before dawn, but then firestarted at another car, said Lt. Richard Summerlot of the Akron FireDepartment. Firefighters stood by, waiting for the fire to go out.   The burning cars were among 17 that derailed from a CSXTransportation train on the grounds of the B.F. Goodrich ChemicalPlant, Fire Chief George Romanoski said.   ``I was watching TV and I heard something and saw the whole skylight up,'' said Minnie Herrington, 40, who was brought to a shelterwith her four children, ages 4 to 11.   ``It sounded like a gunshot.''   Thirteen people were treated at Akron General Hospital, mostsuffering from inhalation of smoke and fumes. One man was admitted,in fair condition.   About 1,500 homes within a half mile of Sunday evening's accidentwere evacuated, police said. They estimated the number of evacueesat 2,000.   Shelters were set up at Kenmore High School and the University ofAkron for those who could not stay with friends or relatives.   Schools in this city of 250,000 were closed and metropolitan busservice was canceled today because the city bus garage is near thederailment site, Summerlot said. Businesses in the area also wereclosed today, he said.   The 45-car train was en route from Willard to Akron and back toWillard when the derailment occurred, CSX spokesman Lloyd Lewis said.   The cause was under investigation.   Nine cars carried highly flammable butane, Lewis said. The eightother cars that derailed carried non-hazardous materials such asvegetable oil, clay and sand, he said.   Another car on the train contained butadiene, which may producehazardous smoke when burned, but it was too far from the burningcars, Mayor Don Plusquellic said.   There was some concern, however, that the fire could spread tothe Goodrich plant, which also housed butadiene, he said.   Butane is non-toxic when burned and is used as a fuel and anaerosol propellant. Butadiene is a petroleum derivative used to makesynthetic rubbers and resins.   ``The area was evacuated because of the danger of explosion inthe surrounding tank cars,'' said Romanoski.   He said evacuees would not be allowed to return to home until thefire was extinguished.   More than 80 people were evacuated to the University of Akron,which would be closed at least until noon, said spokesman PhilZimmer.   About 550 people were taken to Kenmore, but many had left theschool to stay with relatives or friends. About 300 people remainedat midnight.   The mood of the evacuees ran from ``resignation to almost ...festive,'' said Brian Williams, assistant school superintendent.Children were given access to the cafeteria and the gymnasium, whereseveral were playing basketball.   ``The kids are all in a good mood,'' Williams said. ``We've hadpeople bring their rabbits, guinea pigs and dogs. I've been in thisbusiness 25 years. A woman comes up to me with a dirty diaper andsays `Where do I put this?' I've never been asked that before.''</TEXT></DOC>
