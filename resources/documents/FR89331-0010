Background on the Colorado Program</ITAG>On December 15, 1980, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approvedthe Colorado program. Information regarding the general background forthe Colorado program, including the Secretary's findings, the dispositionof comments, and detailed explanation of the conditions of approval canbe found in the December 15, 1980, <T4>Federal Register</T4> (45 FR 82173). Actions concerning program amendments,taken subsequent to the approval of the Colorado program, may be foundat 30 CFR 906.15.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Submission of Proposed Amendments</ITAG>By letter dated May 26, 1987, Colorado submitted to OSMRE the proposedamendments (Administrative Record No. CO-336) to the Colorado program.The State submitted the majority of these proposed amendments in responseto OSMRE's letter dated May 7, 1986 (Administrative Record No. CO-282).This letter was issued in accordance with 30 CFR 732.17(d) and notifiedthe State of required amendments to its program. The remainder of the proposedamendments were submitted at the State's initiative in order to improveits program.OSMRE published a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on June 29, 1987 (52 FR 24173), announcing receiptof the proposed amendments to the Colorado program and inviting publiccomment on the adequacy of the proposed amendments. After reviewing theproposed amendments and all comments received, OSMRE notified Coloradoby letter dated October 15, 1987 (Administrative Record No. CO-357), ofseveral provisions in its proposal that appeared to be inconsistent withthe Federal regulations. By letter dated December 17, 1987 (AdministrativeRecord No. CO-360), Colorado provided further clarification of and submittedrevisions to the amendments. On November 6, 1987, Colorado withdrew theproposed amendments on revegetation in their entirety at Rule 4.15.7(1)and in part at Rule 4.15.7(2) (Administrative Record No. CO-358). To allowthe public an opportunity to comment on the additional material submittedby Colorado, OSMRE published a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on March 7, 1988 (53 FR 7211), reopening andextending the comment period. The comment period closed on March 22, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Director's Findings</ITAG>The Director finds in accordance with SMCRA, and the Federal regulationsat 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, that the program amendments submitted by Coloradoon May 26, 1987, and subsequently revised and clarified on December 17,1987, meet the requirements of SMCRA and 30 CFR Chapter VII as discussedbelow. However, the Director may require further changes in the futureas a result of Federal regulatory revisions, court decisions, and OSMREoversight of the Colorado program. Only provisions of particular interestare discussed below. Provisions discussed are those having no Federal counterpart,or those containing wording that is dissimilar to the corresponding Federalprovisions and/or substantively different from the Federal counterpart.Provisions which are not discussed either contain language substantivelyidentical to the corresponding Federal provisions or do not adversely affectother aspects of the program.A. Exemptions(1) <T3>Acreage exemption.</T3> As originally approved, Colorado Rule 1.05.1(2)excluded coal extraction operations affecting two acres or less from regulation.Similarly, as originally enacted, section 528(2) of SMCRA exempted coalextraction operations affecting two acres or less. However, on May 7, 1987,the President signed Pub. L. 100-34, which repealed this exemption andpreempted any corresponding acreage-based exemptions included in Statelaws or regulations. The amendment under consideration in this rulemakingremoves the State regulatory language preempted by Pub. L. 100-34. Therefore,the Director finds Colorado Rule 1.05.1, as revised by this amendment,to be no less stringent than section 528 of SMCRA. Removal of the acreageexemption from the Colorado rules will avoid confusion on the part of thepublic, which may not be aware of the Federal preemption.(2) <T3>Exemption determination procedures. </T3>Colorado Rule 1.05.1(1) providesexemptions to (1) landowners extracting coal for noncommercial use fromland that they own or lease; (2) persons extracting coal as an incidentalpart of Federal, State or local government-financed construction, and (3)persons extracting coal incidental to the extraction of other mineralsif the coal does not exceed 16-\2/3\ percent of the mineral tonnage removedfor commercial use or sale. Colorado proposes to add Rule 1.05.1(2) toestablish exemption determination procedures for use when a person claimsone of these exemptions. Colorado's proposed rule is almost verbatim to the counterpart Federalregulation at 30 CFR 700.11(c). The proposed amendment differs from theFederal regulation only in that Colorado would issue a written determinationwithin 10 working days of a person's request for an exemption, whereasthe Federal regulation states that the regulatory authority shall makea written determination within a ``reasonable time.'' OSMRE considers the Colorado timeframe of 10 working days to be a reasonabletime. Therefore, the Director finds Colorado Rule 1.05.1(2) to be no lesseffective than its Federal counterpart at 30 CFR 700.11(c). B. Prime Farmland (1) <T3>Negative determinations</T3>. Colorado proposes to recodify existingRule 2.04.12(4) as 2.04.12(5) and add a new paragraph (4) allowing a personto request and, where appropriate, obtain a negative prime farmland determinationin advance of filing a permit application. A negative prime farmland determinationcan be made only when no land within the proposed permit areas is primefarmland historically used for cropland. Under the existing regulations,the applicant is required to submit a request for a negative determination,if appropriate and desired, as a part of the permit application. The proposedrule would allow the applicant to submit a request for a negative determination,with the accompanying rationale, prior to submitting a permit application.If granted, the negative determination would then be included in the permitapplication. The corresponding Federal rule at 30 CFR 785.17(b), as revised on May 12,1983 (48 FR 21462), no longer includes the specific provisions for negativedeterminations previously found at 30 CFR 779.27, as promulgated on March13, 1979 (44 FR 15370), but it does require that the results of a primefarmland reconnaissance inspection be included in each permit application.Since, under Rule 2.04.12(1), the prospective applicant would have to conducta similar investigation before requesting the negative determination, theDirector finds that proposed Rule 2.04.12(4) is not inconsistent with theFederal regulations at 30 CFR 785.17. (2) <T3>Soil survey handbooks</T3>. Colorado proposes to undate Rule 2.06.6(2)(a),which requires a soil survey of the permit area in accordance with certainhandbooks published by the U.S. Soil Conservation Service, to reflect handbookrevisions that have occurred since program approval. Specifically, Coloradoproposes to incorporate by reference the 1983 edition of the U.S. Departmentof Agriculture (USDA) National Soils Handbook and delete the specific incorporationby reference of USDA Handbooks 436 (``Soil Taxonomy,'' 1975 edition) and18 (``Soil Survey Manual,'' 1951 edition). The corresponding Federal regulationat 30 CFR 785.17(c)(1) references all three handbooks; however, the NationalSoils Handbook itself also incorporates the other two handbooks by reference.Therefore, the Director finds the proposed Colorado amendment to be noless effective than this Federal rule. C. Bonding and Insurance Requirements (1) <T3>Letters of credit. </T3>Colorado Rule 3.02.4(2)(d) establishes requirementsfor letters of credit used for reclamation bonding purposes. Subsection(d)(ii) specifies that a letter is irrevocable unless, at least 90 daysprior to its anniversary date, the bank otherwise notifies MLRD and thepermittee. To clarify this de facto automatic renewal provision, Coloradois adding a new subsection (d)(vii), which specifically states that lettersof credit will be automatically renewed on their anniversary dates unlessnotice is given pursuant to subsection (d)(ii). The corresponding Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.21(b) have no provisionfor automatic renewal of letters of credit, nor do they require advancenotice of any intention not to renew. By including these requirements Coloradois providing additional safeguards against lapses in bond coverage. Noneof the amendment's provisions conflicts with the Federal letter of creditrequirements. Therefore, the Director finds that the proposed amendmentto Colorado Rule 3.02.4(2)(d) is consistent with the requirements of SMCRAand the Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 800. (2) <T3>Opportunity for bond release hearing</T3>. Unlike the correspondingFederal rules at 30 CFR 800.40, the Colorado program (CRS 34-33-125 andRule 3.03.2) requires separate public notices for the bond release applicationand MLRD's subsequent proposed decision on that application. Like 30 CFR800.40(f), Colorado Rule 3.03.2 (3) allows certain government agenciesand any person with a valid legal interest which might be adversely affectedby release of the bond to file written comments, objections or requestsfor an informal conference with MLRD within 30 days of the last publicationof the bond release application notice. However, unlike 30 CFR 800.40(f),the Colorado rule does not also allow requests for public hearings to befiled at this time. Instead, such requests must be made after MLRD actuallyproposes a decision on the application. The Secretary previously approved this arrangement since the advertiseddecision on the application is proposed, not final, and since, in additionto the newspaper notice required by the State statute, Colorado Rule 3.03.2(5)requires that written notification of the proposed decision be providedto the permittee and all interested parties. This notification must includean opportunity to request a hearing. The term ``all interested parties''includes all persons and agencies who commented on the bond release application.Since the two notice periods cannot run concurrently, the Colorado programprovides more opportunity and time for public participation than do theFederal rules. As originally approved, Rule 3.03.2(6)(a) stated that requests for a hearingmust be received within 30 days of the date notice of the proposed decisionwas mailed. Colorado is now proposing to revise this timeframe to 30 days after thefirst newspaper publication of the proposed decision pursuant to CRS 34-33-125(4).In practice, the new deadline will likely be later than the one originallyapproved since the letters usually will be mailed before the notice ispublished. For this reason, and since Colorado provides a greater overallopportunity and length of time for public and interested party participationin the bond release process than SMCRA and the Federal rules, the Directorfinds that revised Rule 3.03.2 is no less stringent than section 519(f)of SMCRA and no less effective than 30 CFR 800.40(f) with respect to publicnotice and opportunity to request a hearing on proposed bond releases.D. Lands Unsuitable and Related AreasColorado proposes to amend Rule 2.07.6(2)(d)(iii) to add a new paragraph(E). This paragraph would require that, should MLRD or the Colorado MinedLand Reclamation Board be unable to determine whether a proposed operationis located on lands specified in Rule 2.07.6(d)(iii) (A) and (D) (landswhere mining is limited or prohibited), the permit application be transmittedwithin 30 days to the appropriate governmental agency for a determinationof the relevant boundaries or distances. Additionally, the National ParkService, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Forest Service(USFS) would be provided a 30-day comment period (with a 30-day extensionavailable upon request) on all requests for valid existing rights determinationson lands under their jurisdiction.The corresponding Federal regulation at 30 CFR 761.12(b)(2) is substantivelyidentical to the proposed State rule except that it does not require thatthe USFS be notified of requests for valid existing rights determinations.Since the USFS is the Federal agency with jurisdiction over some of thelands listed in Rule 2.07.6(2)(d)(iii) (A) and (D), it is logical to includeit in the notification requirements. Notification will provide an additionalsafeguard against improper authorization of mining in protected areas;it does not conflict with any Federal provisions. Therefore, the Directorfinds that Colorado's proposed Rule 2.07.6(2)(d)(iii)(E) is no less effectivethan the corresponding Federal regulation at 30 CFR 761.12(b)(2).E. Topsoil(1) <T3>Soil analyses. </T3>Colorado proposes to amend Rule 2.04.9(1)(b) toallow a waiver of the requirement that permit applications include analysesof certain specific parameters (pH, electrical conductivity, sodium absorptionratio and texture) as part of the baseline information on soils. Analysisof soil samples for one or more of these parameters could be waived ifthe applicant demonstrates that such analyses are not necessary, basedon site-specific conditions.The corresponding Federal regulation at 30 CFR 779.21 requires a descriptionof the soils but does not specify the parameters to be described. in thisrespect, the existing Colorado rule is more specific than the Federal rule.The proposed amendment would provide Colorado with the flexibility to determinewhat parameters should be analyzed based on site-specific conditions andthe ability to waive certain analyses when it is decided that they arenot needed. Therefore, the Director finds that the Colorado rule at 2.04.9(1)(b),as amended, is no less effective than the corresponding Federal regulationat 30 CFR 779.21.(2) <T3>Topsoil removal.</T3> Colorado proposes to amend Rule 4.06.2(5) todelete language giving MLRD explicit authority to limit the size of topsoilremoval areas to minimize air or water pollution. It also proposes to reviseRule 4.06.2(5)(b) to specify that, to the extent practicable, the surfacesoil layer shall be removed (rather than redistributed as in the currentrule) at a time when the physical and chemical properties of the topsoilcan be protected and erosion can be minimized. Similar standards for topsoilredistribution are being retained in Rule 4.06.4(2). Current Rule 4.06.2(5)(c),which authorizes MLRD to require such measures as are necessary to controltopsoil erosion, is also being retained as new Rule 4.06.2(6). Air pollutionwill continue to be controlled by the State Air Quality Control Division.The corresponding Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.22 and 817.22 no longercontain requirements specifically limiting the size of topsoil removalareas because, as explained in the preamble to those rules (48 FR 22099,May 16, 1983), OSMRE believes other rules concerning topsoil protection,effluent limitations and erosion control will adequately limit the sizeof such areas in a de facto sense. The preamble further states that theregulatory authority has the discretion to limit the size of disturbedareas if local soil and climatic conditions necessitate such action.Therefore, for the above reasons, the Director finds proposed ColoradoRules 4.06.2 (5) and (6) to be no less effective than the correspondingFederal topsoil regulations at 30 CFR 816.22 and 817.22 and surface stabilization(air pollution attendant to erosion) regulations at 30 CFR 816.95(a) and817.95(a).<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments</ITAG>As discussed in the section of this notice entitled ``Submission of ProposedAmendments,'' the Director solicited public comment and provided opportunityfor a public hearing on the proposed amendments. No public comments werereceived, and since no one requested an opportunity to testify at a publichearing, no hearing was held.Pursuant to section 503(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11), commentswere also solicited from various Federal agencies with an actual or potentialinterest in the Colorado program. Only the USFS provided substantive comments,which are summarized and discussed below.The first comment concerns proposed Colorado Rules 2.06.2 (4) and (5),which relate to experimental practices. The USFS is concerned that anyexperimentation conducted on a Federal lease by the Federal land managementagency may require the prior approval of a State agency. The USFS statesthat, as a matter of course, it will be involved in mining-related researchon revegetation and reclamation and the maintenance or improvement of water,air and soil quality on National Forest lands. The agency requests thatthe proposed rules be modified to provide an exemption for experimentationconducted by Federal agencies on the Federal lands for which they haveadministrative responsibility.In response, the Director notes that, in accordance with section 711 ofSMCRA, the State rules contain requirements similar to those of the Federalregulations at 30 CFR 785.13 (b) and (h). Neither the Federal rules norSMCRA provide an exemption for experimentation conducted by a Federal agency.However, OSMRE does not believe that these rules will unduly interferewith Federal land management experimentation or research activities becausethe rules apply only when such activities would require a variance froma specific State program performance standard. Most research can be accommodatedwithout resorting to such a variance.The second comment concerns proposed Colorado Rule 2.07.6(2)(d)(iii)(E),which pertains to lands on which mining is prohibited or limited. The USFSrequests that it be included by name as a Federal agency that must be contactedwhen the boundaries of such lands cannot be determined by Colorado. TheUSFS reasons that, since a majority of the lands in Rule 2.07.6(2)(d)(III)(A)(the National System of Trails, the National Wilderness Preservation System,the Wild and Scenic Rivers System, and National Recreation Areas) are locatedwithin National Forests, the USFS should be notified when there are boundaryquestions. As noted in Finding D, Colorado has modified its rule as requested.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Director's Decision</ITAG>The Director, based on the above findings, is approving the amendmentsas submitted by Colorado on May 26, 1987, and as revised and clarifiedon December 17, 1987, provided that Colorado promulgates these regulationsin a form identical to that submitted to and reviewed by OSMRE and thepublic, with the exception of the correction of typographical errors. TheDirector is amending 30 CFR Part 906 to implement this decision. This finalrule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State programamendment process and to encourage States to conform their programs tothe Federal standards without undue delay. Consistency of State and Federalstandareds is required by SMCRA.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Procedural Determinations</ITAG>Compliance with the National Environmental Policy ActThe Secretary had determined that, pursuant to section 702(d) of SMCRA,30 U.S.C. 1292(d), no environmental impact statement need be prepared onthis rulemaking.Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility ActOn July 12, 1984, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) granted OSMREan exemption from sections 3, 4, 7, and 8 of Executive Order 12291 foractions directly related to approval or conditional approval of State regulatoryprograms. Therefore, this action is exempt from preparation of a RegulatoryImpact Analysis and regulatory review by OMB. The Department of the Interiorhas determined that this rule will not have a significant economic effecton a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>). This rule will not impose any new requirements; rather,it will ensure that existing requirements established by SMCRA and theFederal rules will be met by the State.Paperwork Reduction ActThis rule does not contain information collection requirements which requireapproval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 30 CFR Part 906</ITAG>Coal mining, Intergovernmental relations, Surface mining, Underground mining.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: March 27, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Nancy C.
