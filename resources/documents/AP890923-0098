It is the first government acknowledgment that the resistance hascaptured territory in a battle seen as a crucial test of theCambodian army, which is fighting for once without Vietnamese troopsupport.   Gen. Tea Banh also said that less than 20,000 government soldiershave been killed or wounded since January 1979, when Vietnam invadedand installed Cambodia's present government.   ``I am speaking to you frankly. We do not claim that we controlall of Pailin,'' the general said of the ruby-rich town near theThai border.   Cambodia's ruby mines are centered in a 16-square-mile area nearPailin. The general said Khmer Rouge troops have seized parts of themining center.   A Soviet military observer said the Cambodian government andKhmer Rouge guerrillas have thrown their best troops into the battlefor Pailin.   He said fighting was fierce and most residents had fled or beenevacuated. The observer, who requested anonymity, spoke in Russianto an East European reporter who made his comments available to TheAssociated Press.   Tea Banh told a news conference that soldiers are exchangingmostly mortar and artillery shells.   But he said the fighting is not a serious security threat to thegovernment, which has been supported by Vietnamese troops since theinvasion that ended a bloody reign of terror by the communist KhmerRouge.   ``Only some parts of the forest have been captured and most ofthe district is in our hands,'' he said.   He indicated the government is willing to hold another round ofpeace talks with the guerrilla coalition it is battling.   In Bangkok on Saturday, Thai Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavanannounced his mediation had won agreement from Cambodian PrimeMinister Hun Sen and leaders of the three guerrilla factions toresume peace talks some time in the future.   ``We would like to continue with our national reconciliation,''Tea Banh said. ``It is very important for us to get peace _ peacethat is for the sake of the people of our country. ... If this peacecomes along with the return of the genocidal regime (of the KhmerRouge), it cannot be accepted.''   The government refuses to allow the Khmer Rouge to take part in atransitional government. Non-Communist guerrilla leaders say theyprefer to share power with the hard-line Communist Khmer Rouge thanfight it.   The Khmer Rouge killed hundreds of thousands of people inattempts at an agrarian revolution in 1975-1978.   Also Saturday, Deputy Defense Minister Gen. Nhim Vanda toldVietnamese troops celebrating their withdrawal that Cambodian troopswill be able to defend the country.   ``During the 10 years our Vietnamese comrades have been inCambodia, the Cambodian military has improved step-by-step,'' hetold a Phnom Penh gathering of Vietnamese forces from threeCambodian provinces.   The guerrillas have their bases near the Thai border, both inThailand and Cambodia, and receive the bulk of their arms viaThailand from China. They hope in the Pailin battle to secure a basedeeper inside the country as well as revenue from the ruby mines.   Vietnam says the last of 26,000 troops in Cambodia will departTuesday, ending involvement in a war that took lives of 25,000Vietnamese troops. Guerrilla leaders say the pullout is a ploy andthat Hanoi is hiding troops in Cambodia.   Tea Banh said about 10,000 Cambodian soldiers have been killed orwounded in combat and another 10,000 died or were hurt by sicknessor landmines.</TEXT></DOC>
