The Jackson forces ``were really incredulous'' at what theyconsider the snub by Dukakis who did not consult Jackson beforenaming Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, said Jackson's convention manager RonBrown.   ``Basically we were flabbergasted by the way this was handled,''Brown said. ``It seems totally contrary to the kinds of open linesof communication we were developing.''   Brown said later Wednesday that he had spoken on three occasionswith Dukakis' campaign manager, Susan Estrich, and that sheapologized for what she said was not a deliberate foulup.   ``If she says it, I believe it,'' he said, but added ``Thereneeds to be some direct contact between Michael Dukakis and JesseJackson,'' to get things back on a positive footing.   The turn of events has the Jackson camp weighing options for itsconvention demeanor. Some supporters independently have raised thepossibility of fighting the Bentsen nomination by running Jacksonfor vice president.   Jackson himself may have fueled that talk on Wednesday when hesaid in Chicago, ``I'm not suggesting that I will compete for aplace on the ticket, but the floor is wide open on Thursday nightwhen the recommendation is made,'' for the vice presidential spot.   And there is ``no chance'' Jackson will embrace the ticketbefore Wednesday's formal vote in which Jackson's name will be putin nomination against Dukakis for the presidential nod, said Brown.   Key Jackson backers are not expressing dissatisfaction withBentsen himself but rather with the way the choice was presented toJackson as a fait accompli.   Brown said Dukakis official Paul Brountas had assured him earlyon that Dukakis would run his selection by Jackson. But insteadJackson learned of the choice from reporters when his plane landedin Washington on Tuesday. He received a telephone call from Dukakisinforming him of the news about an hour later, Jackson said.   Bert Lance, the former Carter Administration official who isclose to Jackson, said he would find it incredible if the slightwas intentional.   ``If that was intentional, it was the biggest mistake they willmake,'' he said in a telephone interview.   Brown and the two advisers who attended Jackson's meeting Mondaywith Brountas, former Democratic National Committee Chairman JohnWhite and Howard University political scientist Ron Walters, saidBrountas clearly indicated Jackson was still being activelyconsidered for the second spot on the ticket.   But two other sources said Brountas told Jackson that day thathe was not to be chosen, although the running mate had not yet beendecided.   At a news conference in Washington Wednesday, Dukakis said heapologized to Jackson on Tuesday for not reaching him with apersonal phone call about the vice presidential choice before areporter revealed the decision to Jackson.   ``I told him how sorry I was I hadn't been able to get throughto him,'' Dukakis said. He said he failed to reach anotheralso-ran, Ohio Sen. John Glenn, before the news got out.   Rep. Major Owens, D-N.Y., a member of the Black CongressionalCaucus that met with Dukakis and Bentsen on Wednesday, said the wayJackson learned of the No. 2 choice was ``a demonstration ofdisrespect.''   But some of Jackson's congressional backers appeared eager for aharmonious convention and made a point of describing Bentsen as agood choice.   ``Lots of fences have been mended,'' said Rep. Mervyn Dymally,D-Calif., chairman of the caucus following the meeting with Dukakisand Bentsen. ``We have a very fruitful discussion about theconvention, the campaign and the presidency.''   Rep. Bill Gray, D-Pa., one of the highest ranking black inCongress as the chairman of the House Budget Committee, urgedJackson supporters to rally around the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket.   Gray said American blacks face ``four more years of civil rightsretrenchment'' if Vice President George Bush wins the presidencyand urged Jackson supporters to ``keep their eyes on the prize.''   ``I believe most black Americans understand the choice isbetween Dukakis and Bush, that they are far more sophisticated thansome people give them credit for,'' Gray said.   And even Owens urged Dukakis to reach out to Jackson.   ``We'd like to see a troika ... a demonstration, symbolicallyfor American television to understand that Jesse Jackson is thethird man on this team ... He's not willing to make Jesse Jackson aspecial third person on that team. He made that clear.''   Jackson's co-chairman in California, Assemblywoman MaxineWaters, raised the possibility of entering Jackson's name for thevice presidential slot, although Brown said ``that is not anythingwe are encouraging.''   He declined to say what Jackson would do if that happened.   He said decisions are up in the air about Jackson's conventionstrategy, and that a lot depends on whether Dukakis tries to makeamends.   ``You can assume we have the wherewithal to make our presencefelt on everything that happens at the convention,'' he added.   Jackson officials had been working out compromises on platformissues in private negotiations, but those have been halted, Brownsaid.   ``It's now up to Michael Dukakis to make it a unityconvention,'' by reaching out to Jackson. Jackson on Tuesdayrepeated his earlier vow to support the Democratic ticket but wasnon-committal on how much he would press is supporters to work forthe ticket in November, saying he would wait to see how theconvention turned out.   Later in the day, he emphasized:   ``It just seems to us that it would have been an absolutepriority on a matter this important and this sensitive for there tohave been direct contact with Jesse Jackson and his campaign priorto any information being disseminated.''</TEXT></DOC>
