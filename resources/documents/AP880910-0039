The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will vote next Wednesdayon the bill, which would impose a near-total trade embargo againstwhite-dominated South Africa and a near-total withdrawal of U.S.investment in the country.   Republican members of the panel, accusing Democrats of playingelection-year politics with the issue, refused a chance to offeramendments to the bill on Friday. They said they prefer the bill asit stands because it is so extensive that it will not attractenough votes to cut off a filibuster on the Senate floor.   ``My guess is that it will be approved by the committee,'' saidSen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., a principal author of the legislation.   ``But because the Republicans are apparently united it will nothave the votes to overcome a filibuster _ we won't get cloture _that's the way it looks right now,'' said Simon.   ``But even if we do nothing more than pass it out of committee,it is a signal to South Africa that we want to change the system''of forced racial separation known as apartheid, he said.   Sixty votes are required in the 100-member Senate to invokecloture and cut off debate on a bill.   The 1988 Democratic platform brands South Africa a terroriststate and Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis hassupported sanctions. Republican presidential candidate George Bushhas opposed new sanctions on they ground they would remove anyleverage the United States may have to work for change in SouthAfrica.   After a morning-long debate on the sanctions bill, Republicancommittee member Sen. Dan Evans of Washington, told reporters:   ``I think it's clearly, clearly pushed by domestic politicalconsiderations and not be the urgency of the situation in SouthAfrica. I think the bill as it now sits will not have a singleRepublican vote on the committee.''   A coalition of Democrats and Republicans enacted a milder SouthAfrican sanctions bill two years ago over President Reagan's veto.   Supporters of the present measure contend it is needed becausethe earlier and less-sweeping bill has not forced the South Africangovernment to end apartheid and to extend full citizenship rightsto the black majority.   The House adopted a similar version of the far-reaching Senatebill on Aug. 11.</TEXT></DOC>
