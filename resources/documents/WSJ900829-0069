Jobs's Next Inc. plans to introduce a slew ofnew products Sept. 18, in what may be its last bid to becomea major player in the computer market.   The rollout -- the second by Next -- will include a morepowerful workstation. Also, Lotus Development Corp. willprovide a version of its popular 1-2-3 spreadsheet for thenew machine.</LP><TEXT>   Next was founded five years ago by Mr. Jobs, whoco-founded Apple Computer Inc. only to be forced out of thecompany by the current chief executive officer, John Sculley.In October 1988, Mr. Jobs introduced Next's first computer tomuch fanfare. But the machine, dubbed the &quot;black cube,&quot; hassold poorly, dogged by criticisms that it runs too slowly,lacks a color monitor and software applications and costs toomuch. Mr. Jobs needs some hot products, fast.   &quot;Steve's going to have to perform a miracle,&quot; said RichardE. Kaplan, vice provost for research and academic computingat the University of Southern California.   However, computer enthusiasts have applauded the softwarechosen by Mr. Jobs to control the Next machine's basicfunctions. The software is a variant of Unix -- a softwareoperating system widely used with technical computers -- andit works with a novel set of screen icons and commands thatsome observers say make it the software of choice for Unixusers. The software, however, is incompatible with that usedon Apple's Macintosh computers or International BusinessMachines Corp. personal computers or their clones.   While Mr. Jobs is enamored of his version of Unix, he aimsto fix most of his machine's shortcomings with his secondNext model. He won't describe the product, but industryobservers say it will be powered by Motorola Inc.'s 68040microprocessor, a top-of-the-line chip that is expected to beavailable later this year.   The new model also will be designed to work with a colormonitor, and it will make even greater use of hard-diskdrives, a standard storage device eschewed by Mr. Jobs in hisoriginal Next box but added later.   Many observers say the new model, while an improvementover the current one, won't be enough to propel Mr. Jobs'scompany out of the also-ran category of computermanufacturers.   &quot;There still isn't a compelling reason to buy it,&quot; saidEsther Dyson, editor of Release 1.0, a newsletter oncomputers.   That's partly because many customers for fancy workstationcomputers -- the category Mr. Jobs sought to storm -- havebeen mesmerized by hardware advances delivered by suchcomputer makers as Sun Microsystems Inc. Next hasn't beenable to match these advances.   A lack of marketing focus and weak sales execution alsohave hampered Next's progress. While the company has inkedsome notable sales to corporations -- the William MorrisAgency, for instance, decided to outfit its offices with Nextmachines -- Next mainly has persuaded universities to buy itsmachines, offering deep discounts as an inducement.   Besides losing out on some technical measures to Sun andothers, Next's prices also are higher, sometimes twice ashigh, as competitors'. Currently, Sun and Hewlett-Packard Co.each offer new models that cost universities less than$3,250, half of Next's university price.   Mr. Kaplan of USC expects Next to drop its prices on Sept.18 or soon afterward, but even with such actions &quot;these other(workstation) guys are leapfrogging Next.&quot;   Mr. Jobs has countered that Next's novel softwareultimately will hook customers, but Ms. Dyson thinks theadvances contained in Next's computers aren't radical enoughto &quot;topple&quot; the desk-top computing standards popularized byIBM, Apple and Microsoft Corp., which sells MSDOS, thepersonal-computer operating system, and Windows, anextension.   Besides, while Mr. Jobs has made much of how Next'ssoftware makes it easier to create applications, somesoftware developers say that other versions of Unix actuallyare easier to work with.   &quot;It's not clear that Next brings that many advantages,&quot;said Patrick Perez, chief executive of Neuron Data, a closelyheld Palo Alto, Calif., concern that sellsartificial-intelligence programs for many computers,including Next's.   Mr. Jobs insists new applications from Lotus and otherswill provide proof that Next's operating software is the soilfrom which &quot;truly revolutionary&quot; applications will sprout.Indeed, people who have seen Lotus's 1-2-3 for the Next sayit makes an eye-opening use of graphics and eases theexchange of information with other applications.   Whether even breakthrough software can rescue Mr. Jobsfrom the margins of the computer industry remains a question.Some observers say regardless of the software Next mustexecute its plans flawlessly from here on out.   &quot;They've got to get it all right this time,&quot; said JonSeybold, editor of the Seybold Report on Desktop Publishing.&quot;There isn't another window for them.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
