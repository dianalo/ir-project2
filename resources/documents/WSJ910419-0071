The new estimates could have far-reaching effects oncongressional redistricting and the allocation of federaldollars to state and local governments.</LP><TEXT>   The findings are based on two Census Bureau projects: apost-enumeration survey conducted in selected areas after the1990 census and a demographic analysis of state, local andfederal administrative records.   The census count for 1990 is 248,709,873 nationwide.According to the post-enumeration figures, however, thecensus count should be somewhere between 252,982,000 and254,989,000.   Under a 1989 court order in a lawsuit brought by New YorkCity and several other cities, the Bush administration mustdecide by mid-July whether to adjust the 1990 count based onthe post-enumeration survey. The decision will be made afterCommerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher reviews recommendationsby the Census Bureau and several independent expertsconcerning the post-enumeration data.   The post-enumeration findings &quot;continue to strengthen thecase that failure to adjust will cause substantial damage inmany, many places across the country,&quot; said Rep. Tom Sawyer(D., Ohio), who heads the House census and populationsubcommittee.   But Census officials were quick to warn that thepost-enumeration data could reflect errors in thepost-enumeration survey itself rather than in the censuscount. &quot;We know we have the symptoms of an undercount,&quot; saidC. Louis Kincannon, bureau deputy director. But he stressedthe need to make sure that the &quot;cure is not worse than theailment.&quot;   If the population count is adjusted, California and otherWestern states probably will gain the greatest benefits,along with the District of Columbia and the rest of theSouth-Atlantic region, according to the post-enumerationestimates. In both regions, the census undercount was foundto be proportionally greater than it was for the entire U.S.   The regions that will benefit the least from an adjustmentinclude New England, the Mid-Atlantic area and the Midwest.No state figures are likely to be adjusted downward, butpopulation counts for certain cities and counties in statessuch as Pennsylvania and Ohio might be lowered, according tobureau assistant director Peter Bounpane.   Despite doubts about the post-enumeration data, it isn'tlikely the bureau's demographic analysis data will changesignificantly, Mr. Bounpane said. According to the analysis,the 1990 census missed 1.8% of the population, compared with1.3% in 1980.   The undercount appears to be particularly sharp forblacks. According to the bureau's demographic analysis, thecensus failed to count 7.2% of the black population, comparedwith 4.7% in 1980. A bureau official said the blackpopulation is harder to count than the population at large,possibly because a high proportion of blacks are low-income.A black majority in the District of Columbia may explain whythe census apparently missed a huge fraction of people livingin the bureau's back yard: According to the post-enumerationsurvey, roughly 4% to 8% of all Washington, D.C., residentswere uncounted.</TEXT></DOC>
