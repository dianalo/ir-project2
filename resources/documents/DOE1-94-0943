The sampling of hydrochloric acid, nitrous acid, nitricacid, sulfur dioxide and ammonia in the gas phase and of chlorine ions,nitrate ions and sulfate ions in suspended particulate matter can becarried out either by a multiple filter system or by an annular set inseries. Advantages and limitations of the sampling systems are discussed.The determination of the indicated species in the water extract of thefilters and in the water solution of the denuders is carried out by ionchromatography.</TEXT></DOC>
