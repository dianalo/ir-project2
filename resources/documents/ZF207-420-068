(DEC) forcomputer hardware; the Unix operating system was written for one of DEC'searly machines, the PDP-7.andP;  The earliest work on Unix was done in 1969-1970,primarily by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson of ATandamp;T Bell Labs.andP;  The Unixsystem was completely rewritten in 1973 using the newly developed Cprogramming language.andM;Because of its legal monopoly on telephone systems in the U.S.andP;  at that time,ATandamp;T was prohibited by the FCC from selling computer products.andP;  So thecompany made the operating system available at no cost to colleges anduniversities.andP;  It was a wise decision, providing a strong technical base forthe system.andP;  The early exposure of entry-level computer scientists to Unixhas certainly added to its growing market today.andM;GETTING INTO THE FACTandM;After the FCC Computer II and the court-ordered divestiture actions of themid-1980s, ATandamp;T was allowed to enter the computer retail business.andP;  But thecompany's computer hardware sales operation got off to a slow start,particularly in the U.S.andP;  retail market.andP;  Many blame ATandamp;T's initial lack ofretail success on in-house management turmoil; they also point to ATandamp;T'sreliance on Olivetti-designed PCs that weren't popular with Americanreviewers or users.andM;You can still buy 4-year-old versions of ATandamp;T Unix computers from resellersat bargain-basement prices.andP;  With the notable exception of a huge governmentcontract, its current lines of 3B2 minicomputers have not been able to make asizeable dent in the market currently owned by DEC, Data General,Hewlett-Packard, Wang, and IBM.andM;This market resistance, however, could subside.andP;  ATandamp;T's new StarLAN andStarGROUP offerings (StarGROUP is the name given to all nonhardwareproducts--the software can be bought on its own), combined with its Unixexpertise, give the company a strong position in the emergingsystems-integration market.andP;  ATandamp;T offers the major things people buyingPC-based LANs and integrated computer systems want: conformity to standards,operational features, support, and integration with higher-level computers.andM;STARLAN AND STANDARDSandM;ATandamp;T is not alone in offering solutions based on twisted-pair wiring.andP;  Soonafter the company developed the StarLAN concept, other companies announcedsimilar twisted-pair products.andP;  For a complete review of high-speedtwisted-pair LANs, see &quot;Making Connections: Fast Performance over TelephoneWire&quot; (PC Magazine, September 13, 1988).andM;The name StarLAN refers to the network wiring and signaling architecturecreated by ATandamp;T that uses (CSMA (Carrier-Sense Multiple Access) protocolsover twisted-pair wire.andP;  The ATandamp;T StarLAN system comes in two differentflavors: 1 Mbps and 10 Mbps.andP;  The 1-Mbps system has been available forseveral years, and though our tests in the PC LAN Labs always showed itsspeed to be enough for most PC applications, it never sold well.andP;  NeitherATandamp;T's marketing nor our testing could convince the people who buy networksthat 1 Mbps is a sufficiently fast transmission speed.andM;ATandamp;T's new 10-Mbps StarLAN 10 system conforms to the draft version of the10BaseT standard prepared by the IEEE (Institute of Electrical andElectronics Engineers).andP;  The 10BaseT IEEE designation refers to a 10-MHzbaseband network utilizing twisted-pair wire; the standard describes thetypes of signaling and kinds of connectors used and the configuration of thewiring system.andM;The appeal of this distribution scheme is that most building already have amodern telephone system in place.andP;  Most phone systems have the two extra wirepairs needed by 10BaseT-conforming LAN hardware, so anyone with such a systemis already wired for this type of network.andP;  The 10BaseT standard, however,makes real economic sense only if the telephone wiring in your building iswell documented, which is not often the case.andP;  If the wiring is such a messthat you will need a new installation anyway, then the only advantage of a10BaseT setup over a system like Token-Ring is the low cost of the wireitself.andM;ATandamp;T is a member of the IEEE committee working on developing the final10BaseT technical specification (its StarLAN products conform to the currentdraft standard), which ensures that its interests will be well represented.andO;The 10BaseT draft specification is about to go to a letter ballot and couldbecome an IEEE standard as early as December 1989.andP;  ATandamp;T plans to update itshardware to ensure compatibility with the standard in its final, approvedform.andM;HARDWARE OFFERINGSandM;ATandamp;T's latest hardware offerings include the ATandamp;T 6386 WGS (Work GroupSystem).andP;  This machine is a little larger than an IBM PS/2 Model 80, uses a20-MHz 80386 processor, and has AT-style expansion slots along with specialslots for 32-bit memory.andP;  The 6386 WGS lacks the rough edges, particularly inits interior layout and design, that were so evident in the early ATandamp;Tproducts.andP;  Our test machine--with 4MB of RAM and an 80MB hard disk--costsslightly over $8,200.andM;ATandamp;T designed the 6386 WGS to run the Unix operating system.andP;  As such, it isa full-blown multiuser/multitasking computer system capable of handling manyterminals.andP;  But the 6386 WGS can act as the backbone server machine in aStarGROUP network of PCs, providing capabilities on a par with Novell, 3Com,and Banyan networking systems; this is an important point for PC systemdesigners.andM;CONNECTING THE COMPUTERSandM;To cover all the types of computers that might attach to a StarLAN 10 LAN,ATandamp;T developed a number of different network interface devices.andP;  For PS/2machines, a $495 MC100 NAU (Network Access Unit) is used with an AUI(Attachment Unit Interface) adapter.andP;  The $495 PC NAU is the primaryinterface for PC- and AT-type computers.andP;  The adapter for the PC AT bus is acircuit board with direct plug-in connections for the telephone wire.andP;  Itdoesn't need the external transceiver used on ATandamp;T's Micro Channel board orfound in some versions of the competing 10-Mbps twisted-pair products.andO;Adapters for ATandamp;T's other computers, including the 3B2 minicomputer line, arealso available.andM;StarLAN 10 features a hub-type topology that matches the wiring-closet anddistribution-panel architecture used for telephones.andP;  All network connectionsrun directly from a node to a Network Hub Unit.andP;  The $1,895 unit provides 11modular jacks and 1 Ethernet transceiver port.andP;  The Ethernet transceiver portallows connections for existing coaxial-cable-based Ethernet networks.andM;The Network Hub Unit performs other functions besides serving as a tie pointfor the client machines.andP;  It also provides amplification and retiming ofnetwork signals before it retransmits them.andP;  This lets you have up to 328feet of wire between the hub and each node.andP;  The hub has lights that indicatewhether the network is operating correctly and whether it is properlyconnected to the nodes, so it is also a valuable troubleshooting tools.andM;Other StarLAN 10 devices available from ATandamp;T include an $895 fiber adapterthat permits workstations to be up to 1 kilometer away from the hub; 1:10 and10:10 network bridges that allow you to add more networks to the system; andan interface to the ATandamp;T ISN (Information Systems Network)--a packet-switchedsystem architecture for large installations.andM;STARGROUP SOFTWAREandM;ATandamp;T wants to offer a comprehensive solution to any organization's networkingneeds; this means allowing the integration of a variety of machine types anda multitude of communications media.andP;  ATandamp;T accomplishes this with itsStarGROUP software for both Unix and MS-DOS systems.andM;While Novell's NetWare, Banyan's VINES, and 3Com's 3+Open LAN Manager networkoperating systems can use many different kinds of network interface cards,StarGROUP supports only ATandamp;T's network interface adapters and a few Ethernetadapters marketed by Ungermann-Bass and Interlan.andP;  StarGROUP does not supportToken-Ring networks.andM;The Unix-based server software, StarGROUP Software LAN Server for Unix, runson ATandamp;T 3B2 and 6386 WGS machines under the Unix operating system, as well ason computers that have compatible versions of ATandamp;T's Unix V operating system,like IBM PS/2 and Compaq systems.andP;  The software and operating system requirea minimum of 4MB of RAM.andM;A Unix-based server has several advantages over a DOS-based served.andP;  For onething, the Unix machine can provide gigabytes of hard disk storage in large,contiguous files.andP;  Second, modern Unix- an DOS-based applications can sharedata files in the Unix-based server.andP;  Finally, the ability to create Unixshell scripts gives system managers and developers flexibility in controllingprinters, gathering statistical data, and performing other maintenancefunctions.andM;On the average, Unix-based servers have much faster throughput than DOS-basedservers like Lantastic, and StarGROUP is no exception.andP;  But StarGROUP stillruns as an application under Unix; the file management-software must passrequests to the Unix operating system for response.andP;  This, combined with thefact that the Unix file system isn't tuned for fast response, means that thethroughput is slower than that provided by products designed to service PCapplications through proprietary operating systems, such as NetWare.andM;The Unix server program supports up to 64 DOS clients simultaneously, with upto 512 links to the server.andP;  In this mode, the Unix operating system iscompletely transparent to the DOS workstation user--the server looks likejust another disk drive.andP;  While Novell can support 100 simultaneous clients,this is not necessarily an advantage--in most installations, several dozenactive clients can keep a server's hard disk drives and network interfaceconnections very busy.andM;MULTIUSER, MULTI-EXTRASandM;Since the underlying Unix operating system has true multiuser/multitaskingcapabilities, many other features are included as part of the StarGROUPsoftware package.andP;  Services like printer spooling and user-to-user messagingare done through Unix utilities.andP;  Devices on client machines, like attachedprinters, can also be made available to the network, freeing you from theneed to attach all the network printers to the file server.andP;  This capabilityallows a user in one department to print a report on the most convenientprinter.andM;The administrator of the StarGROUP system controls the software from any DOSPC on the network or from any terminall communicating with the Unix side ofthe computer.andP;  Since any PC can log on through the network as a Unixterminal, it's simple for the administrator to enter the StarGROUPconfiguration program.andP;  StarGROUP (both the Unix and DOS versions) includes asoftware package called Menus that you can load as an interface both for theadministrator and for users.andP;  Menus helps the administrator manage usercapabilities, file access, and printer functions.andM;You must spend a little more time configuring ATandamp;T's Menus than you have towith similar products from Novell and Banyan, which automatically readfactors like server names from the environment.andP;  The process moves quickly,though.andP;  If you don't want to load Menus, you can control the network througha command language--it is not difficult to use, and ATandamp;T's excellent manualsare a big help.andP;  Overall, the StarGROUP server software is simple to installand configure, through the menus or the command language.andM;The StarGROUP Software LAN Server for MS-DOS runs on PC hardware runningMS-DOS 3.1 or later.andP;  It provides the same basic file and printer services asthe Unix version, but it gives StarGROUP server capabilities compatible withMS-DOS machines.andP;  The software runs in either a dedicated or a nondedicatedserver mode, so a DOS system can service inrequent file and printer requestsand still run DOS application software.andM;Network applications written to industry standards, including MS-DOS 3.1 orlater and the NetBIOS programming interface of the IBM PC network, are fullysupported.andP;  We didn't benchmark test the LAN server for DOS, but you canexpect its performance to be on a par with IBM's PC Local Area NetworkProgram: both put a layer of software on top of DOS to moderate multiplesimultaneous requests for file service and pass the requests on to DOS one ata time.andP;  In both systems, DOS winds up as the bottleneck.andP;  The DOS serverprogram is useful for providing workgroup-level file service as part of alarger organizational network.andM;As for client software, the StarGROUP's client component loads on any PCrunning DOS 3.1 or later.andP;  We ran it on Dell System 200 and Compaq Deskpro386/20 computer systems.andP;  The package takes up 62K of RAM if you load itnormally, but you can take advantage of expanded memory.andM;Client-station users can choose either menus or command-line entries tocontrol links to the servers' resources.andP;  Administrators can automate theoperation of the client systems with batch files.andM;SYSTEM ADMINISTRATIONandM;You can manage StarGROUP from any workstation, but a complete set of consolecommands is available from the server's keyboard.andP;  A menu-driven programcalled Interface (Face for short) allows control over print-job queues andlogged-in stations and produces excellent on-screen reports on server andprinter activity.andM;The StarGROUP package comes with a program called Windows ServerAdministration, a special version of Microsoft Windows.andP;  If you don't likemenus or a command language, you can mouse your way through the process oflinking client stations to network resources.andM;For security, StarGROUP uses the concept of &quot;sharenames,&quot; common to manynetwork operating systems, to identify and control resources shared acrossthe network.andP;  A disk drive subdirectory, or port is assigned a specialsharename that designates the resource--the resource can also be givenpassword protection.andP;  At individual workstations, a menu or command languagelinks the local disk drive or port to the sharename.andM;Since passwords control each sharename, system administrators can have a finedegree of security control.andP;  In theory, the control of many passwords can bea burden on the system administrator, but in real networks only a fewresources usually need extra password protection.andP;  Novell's NetWare and someother network operating systems use a security system that associates aperson's rights and privileges with membership in a workgroup rather thanwith access to a resource.andP;  Overall, the administrator's workload is aboutthe same for both security plans.andM;A HOST OF OPTIONSandM;Optional 386 server packages include an asynchronous communications gatewaythat uses IBM's ACS protocol (see &quot;Building Workgroup Solutions: AsynchronousCommunications Servers,&quot; PC Magazine, May 16, 1989) and the network versionof CrossTalk XVI for terminal emulation.andP;  An asynchronous communicationsgateway enables a remote DOS workstation to establish a dial-up or directRS-232 connection with a network server.andP;  It also allows people on thenetwork to share modems or other serial devices.andM;ATandamp;T markets its own AccuNET X.25 network, so it isn't surprising that theStarGROUP software has an optional X.25 gateway and router service.andM;The increasing popularity of Unix is convincing many companies to offerapplication software that can run on both a larger, Unix-based minicomputersystem and on DOS-based PCs.andP;  One example of this is Informix's databasepackage, which provides the means to create a true distributed databasesystem.andP;  You can create data tables on a terminal through the minicomputer'smultiuser operating system and then update them from a PC.andP;  Common file areascan be created that look like DOS files to the PC and Unix-type files toterminals attached to the host.andM;ATandamp;T PMX-STARMail, a $995 component of the ATandamp;T Private Message Exchange(PMX) software family, brings DOS clients on StarLAN networks into a PMXnetwork.andP;  This package can be tailored to meet the needs of any sizeworkgroup.andP;  And gateways to IBM's DISOSS and PROFS and to HP, Wang, and DECoffice systems are provided through ATandamp;T Message Exchange.andP;  You can attachnon-ASCII files to mail messages and send them across the network.andM;ATandamp;T allows connections to IBM mainframes through its AS/Gateway SBS, whichoffers low-cost access to SNA mainframes.andP;  The network gateway emulates 3274type C cluster controllers, and the networked PCs become 3278/9 terminals.andO;Up to five sessions may be active from a single PC at any one time.andP;  (Formore information on similar LAN gateway packages, see &quot;Building WorkgroupSolutions: LAN Gateways,&quot; PC Magazine, November 29, 1988.)andM;The administrator in charge of networks consisting of 100 or more nodes canmanage the LAN's hardware and software using the StarGROUP Software NetworkManager.andP;  The software supports such things as administration andreconfiguration of network nodes, monitoring of equipment status andperformance, collection and reporting of data, and trouble-shooting andproblem isolation.andP;  The main functions of the network manager software areimplemented using an Informix-based on-line database called the NetworkConfiguration Database.andP;  This software will run on 3B2 or 6386 WGS machines.andM;SERVICE WITH A SMILEandM;ATandamp;T does more than simply drop off any of these products on your doorstep.andO;The company's size and international presence give it the resources to offera comprehensive support and service plan than can meet the needs of themajority of users.andM;First, you get the industry-standard 90-day warranty, including a toll-freehotline for questions and advice and mail-in/carry-in replacement service forhardware problems.andP;  Basic warranty holders have access to the hotline duringbusiness hours.andP;  A 24-hour hotline number is available for extended-warrantyholders.andM;Once the warranty expires, you can choose from among three types of service.andO;One is essentially the same as the service supplied with the standardwarranty, including weekday telephone support and mail-in hardwarereplacement.andP;  The second level type offers a 24-hour toll-free support numberand field maintenance.andP;  The most comprehensive coverage includes ATandamp;T'spromise of a maximum 4-hour response time for a major failure and a 24-hourresponse for minor failures.andP;  All service work is done by ATandamp;T-trainedtechnicians operating from offices in most major metropolitan areas.andM;In addition to these service plans, ATandamp;T provides two user-training courses(each costing $1,100 per student) at facilities in Chicago, Philadelphia, andSunnyvale, California.andP;  The first provides a technical overview of StarLAN;the second covers StarLAN network administration.andM;WIRED COMPETITIONandM;In the area of 10-Mbps twisted-pair systems, ATandamp;T's main competitors areHewlett-Packard, 3Com, and SynOptics Communications.andP;  HP offers a similarStarLAN 10-type product, including a $695 PC Link and a $2,995 StarLAN 10hub.andP;  The HP OfficeShare software provides file-and printer-sharing servicessimilar to the ATandamp;T products.andM;SynOptics Communications' LattisNet has been shipping longer than the othercompetitors.andP;  It provides a unique option that allows direct connection toApple Macintosh products.andP;  The PC part of the connection is accomplished viathe $495 Micom-Interlan N15210 LattisNet interface card.andO;LattisNetConcentrators, which are comparable to StarLAN hubs, start at$2,800.andM;3Com's PairTamer 10-Mbps wiring system is less expensive than any of thealternatives and uses only one wire pair.andP;  PairTamers run with any Ethernetcards.andM;SOLUTION WITH STAYING POWERandM;ATandamp;T has asked a firm claim on the still-underdeveloped twisted-pair marketwith its StarLAN 10 hardware and StarGROUP software.andP;  Expect to see morecompanies looking for compatibility with a Unix-type environment migrating toATandamp;T's types of solutions--ATandamp;T, after all, has many years of experience inthe Unix system development area.andM;If you're looking for a company that can give you a total solution, fromplanning the witing to fixing a bad interface card, look closely at ATandamp;T.andP;  Inthese days of mergers, buy-outs, and bankruptcies, it's important to dobusiness with a company that you can count on being there in the future.andP;  Ifpast history is any inidication, ATandamp;T will be around for some time to come.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
