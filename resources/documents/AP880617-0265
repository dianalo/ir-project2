BIGELOW</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Federal authorities have revised theircharges against fallen carpet-cleaning whiz kid Barry Minkow byfiling a superseding indictment that adds conspiracy andcredit-card fraud counts to the original case.   The revised 57-count indictment, filed Thursday, names the22-year-old Minkow and three other defendants as participants in analleged conspiracy to commit securities fraud, obtain fundsfraudulently and falsify legal documents.   The new indictment also alleges that Minkow's illegal conductbegan when the entrepreneur who founded the ZZZZ Bestcarpet-cleaning empire was 18 years old _ at least two yearsearlier than previously disclosed.   An added count of credit card fraud alleges that as early asOctober 1984, Minkow ``devised and participated in a scheme todefraud by making unauthorized charges to credit-card numbers ofZZZZ Best customers.''   Minkow allegedly obtained more than $29,800 from 16 customersthrough the credit-card scheme.   Minkow's defense attorney, David Kenner, could not immediatelybe reached for comment. But at a news conference a week ago, Kennerdeclared that his client was a fall guy, ``nothing more than astepchild of organized crime.''   A racketeering count, which carried a 20-year maximum sentence,has been deleted from the new charges.   Assistant U.S. Attorney James Asperger said the racketeeringcount allowed federal authorities to seize Minkow's assets. ButAsperger said those assets have become tied up in U.S. BankruptcyCourt.   The prosecutor said the revised indictment increases the maximumprison term Minkow faces, if convicted, from 350 years to 403 years.   The original indictment, which was unsealed Jan. 15, chargedMinkow and 10 other defendants with 54 counts of bank fraud, moneylaundering, tax fraud and racketeering. A 12th defendant was namedin a separate complaint.   Most of the previously filed counts are included in the newcase, although all but the four remaining defendants have pleadedguilty or are expected to do so before trial.   Minkow founded his ZZZZ Best carpet-cleaning company in hisparents garage in suburban Reseda when he was just 15.   Four years later, in 1985, he incorporated the business and theZZZZ Best Co. became a publicly traded firm in the over-the-countermarket in January 1986.   However, the revised indictment alleges that as early as March1985, Minkow and other defendants falsely claimed ZZZZ Best wasperforming restoration work on buildings damaged by water, fire andother causes.   ``At its height, the restoration work purportedly comprised over90 percent, or $43.7 million of ZZZZ Best's annual revenues,'' theindictment states. ``In fact, ZZZZ Best performed virtually norestoration work.''   When accusations concerning the fraudulent nature of Minkow'scarpet restoration work began surfacing in May 1987, the indictmentalleges Minkow ``orchestrated a cover-up in which he recruitedvarious persons to lie to attorneys, accountants and others whowere investigating'' the ZZZZ Best carpet-cleaning company.</TEXT></DOC>
