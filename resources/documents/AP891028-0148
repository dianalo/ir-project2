But paradise has a trap door.   Below its surface are plates of earth that slip and slide pasteach other with enough occasional fury to move mountains, flattenfreeways and put lives and lifestyles in peril.   The Oct. 17 quake jolted the fickle existence of NorthernCalifornians who inhabit a world so ideal that Mark Twain called it``life on the half shell.''   ``California has always represented the dream of a better life,more sunshine, more space, a perfect home. But it's also the centerof tragedy: fires, earthquakes, mudslides, all kinds ofdisasters,'' said Kevin Starr, a San Francisco historian and afourth-generation Californian.   ``To be a Californian now is not to be an escapist, but it's tobe a high-risk person.''   San Francisco was named the nation's second-most livable city byRand-McNally just a week after it got its most potent jolt since1906. It is synonymous with earthquakes the way Johnstown, Pa., iswith floods.   It's another stereotype. But Californians endure them the sameway they endure Easterners and rain, as a nuisance.   Blissful California is the land of the laid-back, tofu,self-awareness, yoga, hedonism, narcissism, wheat grass juice,kooks, nutballs and weird religions.   ``The rest of the country thinks we all sit around in hot tubswith glasses of white wine and grow organic gardens, and we do, butso what,'' said Steve Gross, a waiter at Coffee Ron's.   A waitress there swears her friend sprained his wrist whileskateboarding in an earthquake fissure.   There was no underestimating the tragedy of the earthquake. Itkilled 64 people. It sent 3,300 to hospitals and forced nearly14,000 from their homes.   ``Earthquakes are something we live with here,'' said realestate agent Jean Sinel of Albany.   And quake response in California was, well, uniquely Californian.   Nancy's Quiches of Menlo Park donated 20,000 quiches to therelief effort. Someone else gave hibachis for cooking. The NationalHolistic Institute sent 200 massage therapists to knead the aching,stressed muscles of rescue workers.   Hanson Industries, a British company that makes hot tubs, sent a$1 million check to the Red Cross to help victims of the earthquakeand Hurricane Hugo.   Costa Rican President Oscar Arias donated 2,500 pounds of coffeebeans to relief agencies in Los Gatos, Santa Cruz, Watsonville andHollister.   A city porn shop offered an ``earthquake special'' of vibratingsex toys.   The quake interrupted baseball's premier event, the WorldSeries, pitting the cross-bay rival Oakland Athletics against theSan Francisco Giants. Sports prowess is another part of the elan ofthe Bay area, also home to the Super Bowl champion 49ers.   One entrepreneur, stuck with stacks of ``Battle of the Bay''T-shirts printed a giant R over the B and came up with ``Rattle ofthe Bay.'' Another shirt read: ``I Went to Candlestick Park for theWorld Series and All I Got Was This Lousy Earthquake.'' A bumpersticker read: ``Stop Continental Drift.''   The temblor was centered 56 miles south of the city under aremote peak of Loma Prieta, or Dark Hill, in the Santa CruzMountains. It registered 7.1 on the Richter scale but didn't reachthe force of The Big One, a quake of apocalyptic proportions thatexperts warn is coming.   Smug Californians called this one The Pretty Big One.   An earthquake simulator, one of the hottest attractions on theUniversal Studios Hollywood tour, suspended operations for 48 hoursafter the quake as a sympathy gesture. ``The Big One'' is set in aSan Francisco transit station.   ``We equated closing it down to flying the flag at half staff,''said spokeswoman Joan Bullard. It is the studio's most popularattraction.   The quake knocked out bridges and freeways, forcing record useof public transit _ no easy trick for Californians who are sowedded to their cars that a hearse driver once tried in vain toclaim the body in his coffin as a passenger so he could use the carpool lane.   ``This is going to be a lifestyle change for us,'' said RodDiridon, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Commission.   Some motorists used ferries that normally carry tourists toAlcatraz and Angel Island. On Monday, gale force winds createdenough waves to cause sea-sickness.   ``I've just been through hell, but heck, I have to admit I madeit through,'' said an ashen-faced John Trowbridge, 27, of Alameda.   The San Francisco Examiner had this to say about lifestyles:``People began to talk of lifestyle changes, as if the earthquakeshad suddenly come into fashion and we had nothing in our wardrobethat matched.''   The quake smashed elegant homes in the city's Marina districtand drove the permanently homeless from the seedy Tenderloin deeperinto their shadowy world. The Moscone Convention Center was used asan emergency center but was cleared out to make room for apre-scheduled meeting of plastic surgeons.   ``The earthquake had no priority list. There's a common joltthat hit us all, every race, every class. It made us all feelfinite,'' said the Rev. Cecil Williams of the Glide Memorial UnitedMethodist Church.   This is the city where Carol Doda jiggled in America's firsttopless bar in 1964, where licentious hippies flourished inHaight-Asbury in the tie-dyed Sixties and where homosexuals cameout of the closet in the Seventies.   Evangelist Virgi Rosemond weaved those threads into the fabricof the quake as she preached this week through a bullhorn atHalladie Park, the city's version of Times Square.   ``Jesus said he would send earthquakes to Godless places. Thiscity's wicked, like Sodom and Gomorrah, where men love men morethan they love God,'' she railed on behalf of the True HopePentecostal Church of God and Christ.   Meanwhile, the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, a band of gaymen who dress in miniskirted nuns' habits and fishnet stockings,will aid earthquake victims by holding benefit dances.   ``We're sort of icons. We're as much a symbol of San Franciscoas earthquakes,'' said Kenneth Bunch, also known as Sister Vicious.``When people call California kooky and weird, they're reacting toour wide-open freedom.''   Two days after the quake, Cynthia Woods lectured reportershuddled near ruins in the Marina and told them to write about themajority of the city that wasn't damaged.   ``We're not a city of kooks,'' she shouted to no one inparticular. ``San Francisco is going to live through this. We'renot something that falls apart. We are survivors.''</TEXT></DOC>
