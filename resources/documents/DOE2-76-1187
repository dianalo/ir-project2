Such a concept involves phenomena as increasingenergy efficiency throughout society, encouraging energy conservationand use of renewable resources, and promoting life styles not needinga large consumption of goods or energy. Recent encouraging signs of energyconservation trends in Canada are offset by lags in the application ofstate of the art energy efficiency techniques in construction and manufacturing.Institutional barriers, such as division of conservation costs betweenbuilding owners and renters, are also mentioned. Some institutional innovationsare being implemented to overcome these constraints, however. Renewableenergy options considered in this paper are limited to solar thermalenergy and biomass. Waste recycling is also considered as an area ofconsiderable potential. Renewable resources in Canada include forestsand water, and expenditures to conserve these resources are seen as essentialinvestments for the future, especially in view of the fact that impactstake years to appear. In the economic sphere, a number of developmentsare outlined, relating to conserver technologies (e.g. those that reduceenvironmental impacts while recovering materials or energy) and industries.The effect of conserver strategies on employment is also examined. Aseparate section of this report discusses Quebec, its cultural developmentand its approach to the conserver society; government actions have beentaken with respect to forests, agricultural land, home energy use, recycling,and changing of public attitudes. 50 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
