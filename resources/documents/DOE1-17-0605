<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-17-0605 </DOCNO><TEXT>We provide a comprehensive analysis of the standard model of the bidirectionalring laser in which only one mode can be supported in each directionand in the limit that the polarization can be eliminated adiabatically.The interaction between the two counterpropagating modes can be derivedand it is most naturally viewed as a coupling between them via scatteringfrom a spatial grating formed in the population inversion. If the gratingis a sufficiently small modulation of the spatial average of the populationinversion, it can be approximated by a sinusoidal function. A systematicderivation of the model with only a sinusoidal grating for the homogeneouslybroadened case is presented that reveals and corrects errors in severalpreviously published analyses. The stability of the steady-state solutionis analyzed. The bidirectional steady-state solution is unstable andthe unidirectional steady-state solutions may be stable or unstable dependingon the parameters. The well-established result of bistability betweenthe two modes when the cavity is tuned to resonance is recovered, a resultthat persists, in part, even when the losses between the two modes aredifferent.</TEXT></DOC>
