He is a multimillionaire of modest manner who runs a venture-capital firm. A bearded, middle-aged businessman who wears a skullcap and an ankle-length robe, the attire of a devout Moslem, he sits behind a big desk, a computer flashing world exchange rates to his left and a screen showing market information overhead.    His Rayan Group is one of the richest and fastest-growing private companies in Egypt. The dozen or so Islamic venture-capital investment firms control as much as $8 billion in Egypt, economists say. Rayan Group has taken deposits from about 300,000 Egyptians, who have gotten returns as high as 30%.    Following Sharia, or Islamic law, Rayan offers Egyptians an alternative to bank accounts paying interest, which Sharia forbids. Mr. Abdelfattah takes deposits and, instead of interest, says it pays a share of the profits of businesses in which his company invests.    But critics in the government say Rayan has obtained such returns not from investing in fledgling enterprises but from playing the foreign-currency markets. This had been lucrative until recently as the Egyptian pound fell steadily in value.    &quot;Some of these companies are investing in Islamic feelings,&quot; says Fahmy Howeidi, an Egyptian intellectual. &quot;They are businessmen before being Moslems. Are they ready to go to jail for the cause? No.&quot;    Maybe not, but many support the faith with money. They have built daycare centers and schools and made cheap housing available to Islamic societies. As such, they fund an alternative Islamic support system that poses a threat to the secular government.
