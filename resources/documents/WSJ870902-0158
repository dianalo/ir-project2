The Trade and Industry Ministry said Korea recorded a $94 million surplus for August, down sharply from surpluses of $386 million a year earlier and $652 million in July. Trade was in surplus for the overall month despite having been in deficit by $460 million in August's first three weeks.    August's exports rose 19% from a year earlier, to $3.49 billion, while imports increased 33%, to $3.40 billion.    Auto and electronics exports have been among the shipments hardest hit by the strikes, ministry officials said.    Despite the narrowing of the surplus in August, Korea's trade surplus in 1987's first eight months widened sharply to $3.06 billion from $919 million a year earlier. </TEXT></DOC>
