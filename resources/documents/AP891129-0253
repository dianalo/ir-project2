Thinking Machines Corp. said the new computer would be capableof conducting 1 trillion mathematical operations per second, thecompany said in a statement released in Washington on Tuesday.   The grant will come from the Pentagon's Defense AdvancedResearch Projects Agency, which has been awarding grants aimed atkeeping the United States the world leader in high-speed computing.   Danny Hills, co-founder and chief scientist of ThinkingMachines, told The Washington Post in today's editions that thecompany hopes to have a model with one-tenth the capacity of thefinal model ready in 1992. He declined to predict when the finalproduct would be available commercially.   High speed computers simulate events in the physical worldnumerically. They are widely used by the government in such fieldsas nuclear weapons design and weather forecasting and are used byprivate companies for such things as semiconductor circuit designand superconductivity research.   Thinking Machines has installed supercomputers at many sitesincluding the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Dow JonesInformation Services.</TEXT></DOC>
