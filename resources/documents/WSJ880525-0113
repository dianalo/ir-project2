The move is the latest in a string of medium-sized acquisitions that Ford, whose cash hoard totals nearly $10 billion, has made in the last few years.    Many Ford-watchers expect the company to make a blockbuster, multibillion dollar acquisition, and Ford executives have said for nearly two years that they are studying possible targets in aerospace, electronics and financial services. But those executives add that they are content to wait for the right opportunity -- and meanwhile they have made a string of relatively modest acquisitions in several business fields.    A Ford spokesman yesterday called the BDM deal &quot;a moderately priced merger that doesn't prevent us from making a big acquisition when the right opportunity comes along.&quot;    Stock of Dearborn, Mich.-based Ford fell 37.5 cents to close at $45.875 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, while BDM stock jumped $3.75 to close at $34.375 in American Stock Exchange composite trading.    BDM International is based in McLean, Va., and insiders, including BDM President Earle C. Williams and BDM's three original founders, control about 80% of BDM's shares outstanding. Industry analysts say that BDM has been seeking a buyer for the past year.    BDM will become part of Ford Aerospace Corp., which mostly manufactures defense hardware such as missile systems and satellites. Ford Aerospace, however, lacks expertise in BDM's primary business of providing professional services to the military. About 93% of BDM's business is in helping the military develop computer software for such tasks as inventory control, performing defense research and development and helping the military analyze bids for defense projects.    The transaction illustrates a trend toward consolidation in the defense professional services industry -- the so-called Beltway Bandits that have sprung up over the past two decades, as the Pentagon increasingly contracted technical work to private concerns.    Takeover rumors have swirled around BDM, which earned $19.7 million in 1987 on revenue of $314 million. In late January, its stock leaped on speculation that Lockheed Corp., Ford and other major defense contractors were pursuing BDM.    At the time, analysts predicted the company would sell for as much as $40 a share, but those estimates dropped, as did BDM's stock, when the company reported lower-than-expected revenue in the first quarter. While most analysts expected BDM to increase its revenue in this year's first quarter, it dropped to $72.9 million from $80.4 million a year earlier.    Since the first quarter, BDM's attractiveness has been enhanced by its aggressive pursuit of Strategic Defense Initiative work. It recently added a $47.8 million contract for technical support and analysis on SDI, and analysts estimate that 15% of the company's revenue flows from SDI projects. </TEXT></DOC>
