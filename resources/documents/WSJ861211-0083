In a related matter, David M. Roderick, USX chairman, said that &quot;friendly&quot; negotiations between the company and New York investor Carl Icahn are continuing but aren't likely to result in any quick pact. Another meeting with Mr. Icahn was held yesterday in New York, Mr. Roderick said.    Mr. Icahn, who holds an 11% stake in USX, made a conditional bid of $31 a share, or about $7 billion, for the company in early October. The bid expired in late October. The takeover threat by Mr. Icahn was a major factor in forcing the company to study possible restructuring steps.    The USX chief executive told reporters in New York that he had &quot;exploratory rather than definitive&quot; talks in London with BP three weeks ago that centered on USX's overseas oil assets. In addition, Mr. Roderick said that &quot;about seven or eight&quot; domestic oil companies have &quot;expressed some interest in talking with us if we get into a restructuring that involves disposal of assets in our oil and gas area.&quot; But USX has held formal discussions only with BP, he said. Mr. Roderick didn't indicate whether further talks are planned with BP.    Selling energy assets has been cited by the company as one of at least a dozen potential restructuring steps. Energy assets, including Marathon Oil Co. and Texas Oil andamp; Gas Corp., represent more than 60% of USX sales.    Mr. Roderick said Pittsburgh-based USX hasn't decided to sell any of its energy assets.    Later, in an interview, Mr. Roderick said no oil companies have approached USX about buying the entire concern, then spinning off its troubled steel unit. But &quot;it's not inconceivable that somebody out there is interested&quot; in such a move, he said.    Mr. Roderick said it was possible that USX could spin off or sell part of its steel business. He also disclosed that some foreign and domestic companies have made &quot;inquiries&quot; about buying some USX mills or investing in them.    The USX executive said he expects to implement some steps toward restructuring the company by the end of January. USX retained two investment banking firms in September to prepare a study of how the company might restructure to enhance shareholder value. USX received the report late last month and is evaluating it. Mr. Roderick indicated he will likely present restructuring recommendations to directors at a meeting next month.    The USX chairman stressed that the company is &quot;not looking for a white knight&quot; in response to Mr. Icahn's takeover threat.    He acknowledged that the talks with Mr. Icahn have been complicated by the current insider-trading scandal on Wall Street involving Ivan Boesky. &quot;Clearly the uncertainties that grew out of (the Boesky scandal) have complicated or prolonged our discussions,&quot; Mr. Roderick said.    Mr. Roderick declined to comment on some financial analysts' suggestions that USX may seek to buy Mr. Icahn's stake at the market price.    Mr. Roderick also confirmed that Robert Holmes a Court, an Australian investor, has been buying USX shares, but said he was unsure of the size of the stake. Mr. Holmes a Court's original holding in USX stock, though minor and later sold, sparked the heavy trading in the company's shares that began in August, attracting Mr. Icahn and others to the stock.    Discussing the strike against the company by the United Steelworkers union, Mr. Roderick contended that &quot;the longer the strike goes, the greater the chances are&quot; that some USX steel mills will never reopen. He said that if the 133-day-old dispute continues past mid-January -- a near-certainty -- the company may lose about half its second-quarter steel orders.    He disputed earlier statements by the union that the company had promised to reopen all its mills when the labor dispute ends. &quot;They have no commitment whatsoever from USX,&quot; he maintained.    He said the &quot;two haunting matters&quot; between the company and the union are wage-and-benefit levels and subcontracting of steel mill work to outside firms. &quot;I would like to see the strike over tomorrow but it's going to last until we get a competitive agreement,&quot; he said. Mr. Roderick added that he hasn't any plans to restart USX mills with fresh recruits, &quot;but that doesn't mean we won't consider it.&quot;    Mr. Roderick said it's &quot;possible but not probable&quot; that USX will take widely anticipated charges in the current quarter to cover permanent closings of certain marginal steel mills. However, Thomas Graham, USX vice chairman, indicated that any such shutdowns would be unlikely this year. </TEXT></DOC>
