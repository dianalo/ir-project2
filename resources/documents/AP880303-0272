The new Social and Liberal Democrats Party hopes to end thedominance of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's governingConservatives and the main opposition, the socialist Labor Party.   The Social Democrats voted nearly 2-1 and the Liberals more than7-1 to merge in mail ballots after separate party conventionsapproved the merger last month. But only slightly more than halfthe party members voted.   Liberal leader David Steel, who is expected to be elected leaderof the new party, told a news conference it will give ``hope to awhole new generation.''   Steel pledged to press for rejuvenation of the ailing NationalHealth Service and run-down inner city neighborhoods.   The Social Democrats' leader, Robert Maclennan, said Britain``needs a great national party, with roots in all our communities.''   Maclennan called the Conservatives ``complacent, centralizing,autocratic'' and the Labor Party ``the complacent, inert,bureaucratic alternative.''   David Owen, who resigned as Social Democrat leader in oppositionto the union, urged members to boycott the vote and called it ``afiasco.'' He plans to continue the Social Democrats as a separateparty.   The two parties placed a distant third in last June's generalelection, in which Mrs. Thatcher won a third term as prime minister.</TEXT></DOC>
