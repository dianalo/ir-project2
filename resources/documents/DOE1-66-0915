An exponential increase in exposureto electromagnetic fields has occurred, largely because of such technologicaladvances as the growth of electrical power generation and transmissionsystems, the increased use of wireless communications, and the use ofradar. In addition, electromagnetic field generating devices have proliferatedin industrial plants, office buildings, homes, public transportationsystems, and elsewhere. Although significant increases have occurredin electromagnetic field strenghths spanning all frequency ranges, thissymposium addresses only the impact of these fields at static and extremelylow frequencies (ELF), primarily 50 and 60 Hz. This volume contains theproceedings of the symposium entitled {open_quotes}Interaction of biologicalsystems with static and ELF electric and magnetic fields{close_quotes}.The purpose of the symposium was to provide a forum for discussions ofall aspects of research on the interaction of static and ELF electromagneticfields with biological systems. These systems include simple biophysicalmodels, cell and organ preparations, whole animals, and man. Dosimetry,exposure system design, and artifacts in ELF bioeffects research werealso addressed, along with current investigations that examine fundamentalmechanisms of interactions between the fields and biological processes.Papers are indexed separately.</TEXT></DOC>
