Relating to Global Certification of Debt Securities, Filingof Proposed Rule Change </ITAG>Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on March 24, 1988, the NewYork Stock Exchange, Inc. filed with the Securities and Exchange Commissionthe proposed rule changes as described in Items I, II, and III below, whichItems have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commissionis publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule changesfrom interested persons. <ITAG tagnum="84">I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substanceof the Proposed Rule Change </ITAG>The Exchange proposes to amend its <T3>Listed Company Manual </T3>to clarify its practice of listing debtsecurities represented by a global certificate. The text of this proposedrevision is set out in Exhibit A. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, andStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change </ITAG>It its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization includedstatements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule changeand discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. Thetext of these statements may be examined at the places specified in ItemIV below and is set forth in Sections A, B, and C below. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of and StatutoryBasis for, the Proposed Rule Change The Exchange's <T3>Listed Company Manual </T3>specifies standards for the textual contentsof certificates and for technical requirements for their physical form.The Manual neither prohibits nor provides for a global certificate/bookentry system, and the engraving standards of Section 5 have been interpretedto apply only where the issuer intends to create individual certificatesfor its security holders. In 1985, the Securities and Exchange Commission determined that the useof a global certificate renders an issue a certificated issue under Article8 of the Uniform Commercial Code and recommended its use for debt securities.In August 1987, the Exchange listed a $200 million debt offering, the firstsecurity listed on the Exchange to utilize a single or global certificate.The proposed language clarifies the Exchange's practice of permitting thelisting of debt securities using a global certificate. The statutory basis under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Act'')is section 6(b)(5) and its requirement that a national securities exchangehave rules that are designed to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanismof a free and open market. B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of Burden on Competition The proposed rule change will not impose any burden on competition. C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the ProposedRule change Received from Members, Participants, or Other No written comments were solicited or received.<ITAG tagnum="84">III.
