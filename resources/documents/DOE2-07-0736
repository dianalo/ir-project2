Only 3 of the samples were showing concentrations below 0.1 mg/kg.Sites and places were found to be playing an essential role. However,the study did not succeed in finding out whether the cadmium concentrationswere varying due to different degrees of contamination in different placesor due to the different soils containing cadmium in different biologicalforms. As regards the Harz region, contamination was obviously causedby a nearly zinc smelting plant. The Berlin region clearly proved toshow excess concentrations, too. Although the Salzgitter and LueneburgHeath values were found to be lowest of all, they are still higher thanthose of mushrooms sold in stores.</TEXT></DOC>
