<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-76-0082 </DOCNO><TEXT>A thin film temperature sensor consisting of an iridium film on a ceramicsubstrate has two distinct advantages over similarly constructed platinumthin film sensors. The iridium sensor can be used in the temperaturerange of -200{sup 0}C to +400{sup 0}C without any hysteresis effects,due to the excellent match in thermal expansion coefficients of iridiumand the ceramic substrate. Since the slope of the resistance vs temperaturecurve increases for iridium (contrary to platinum), an iridium resistanceelement can easily be linearized by using a shunt resistor. The basiccharacteristics of the iridium thin film sensor are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
