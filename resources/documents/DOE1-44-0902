The method was developed based on theclassification method used for existing workings. Explanations and remarksare given together with 3 tables which can be helpful in applying themethod described. The importance of hazard classification, the standardsin force and definitions are discussed. Forecasting of methane hazardsis surveyed. A method of preliminary classification of rooms and workingsin the design process as well as squealer forecasting is described. Themethod is based on the maximum possible methane concentration in workings,and on forecasting squealers and methane buildup under the roof. 7 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
