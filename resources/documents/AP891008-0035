Manuel Antonio Noriegaduring a coup attempt last week but the uprising collapsed beforethe plan could be executed, top officials said Sunday.   President Bush made the decision near the end of a failed couplast Tuesday, and the order was conveyed to the commander of U.S.forces in Panama, Gen. Maxwell Thurman, said Secretary of StateJames A. Baker III and Brent Scowcroft, the White House nationalsecurity adviser.   ``The message that was sent was that if there were anopportunity to do this, without risking bloodshed and significantloss of American life, and to do so without open militaryinvolvement, then he was free to go ahead, the commander on theground was free to go ahead,'' Baker said on the NBC-TV program,``Meet the Press.''   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said that at the outset of thecoup, he told Thurman to be prepared to use peaceful means to takecustody of Noriega, but the chance never came.   ``After the Panamanians had contacted us and told us ... thatthey had Noriega but that they would not give him to us, I made itclear that our commander on the scene was authorized to get him ifhe could, without using military force, and that he should developan option or a plan to use military force to get him,' Cheney saidon the CBS-TV program, ``Face the Nation.''   ``We never made the decision to use military force, that wouldhave involved going in against the rebels and taking Noriega fromthem. I never thought that was a very good idea, but we told to himto be prepared in case he got the order to do so. Shortly afterthat, the coup fell apart,'' said Cheney.   The order to ready non-uniformed U.S. forces for a covert actionto grab Noriega was first reported in Sunday editions of theWashington Post.   Although that report did not attribute the decision to thepresident, Scowcroft said, ``President Bush personally wasresponsible what ever guidance was sent down, yes, personallyordered whatever guidance was sent to General Thurman.''   Baker, Cheney and Scowcroft said top presidential advisersbelieve they acted correctly during the failed coup, despitecriticism from Congress that U.S. forces should have helped therebels or to intervened to seize Noriega for trial in the UnitedStates on drug charges.   ``There is nothing like 20-20 hindsight. Given what we know nowabout what was actually happening on the ground, then, I think Iwould not change what we did,'' Scowcroft said on the ABC-TVprogram, ``This Week with David Brinkley.''   Nearly a week after the incident, it was still not 100 percentcertain that the rebels who seized Noriega's headquarters ever hadcustody of the strongman, Scowcroft said, and they told the deputyU.S. commander in Panama. Maj. Gen. Marc Cisneros, that they wouldnot hand him over.   ``The rebels never asked us, indeed when we had that one meetingwith General Cisneros, we asked them to give him, and they said,`No,''' said Scowcroft.   ``At that point, we became fairly certain, although we did notknow for sure and still have no positive proof Noriega was there.We had pretty good assurance that Noriega was in fact there,'' andthe decision was made to use non-uniformed U.S. forces to grab him,said Scowcroft.   The indication later Tuesday that Noriega was at hisheadquarters about 600 yards from the U.S. command center ``changedthe calculus of what we were prepared to do,'' said Scowcroft.   Noriega has told reporters that he was never in custody and``the last thing he has said was that, no, he was never there,''said Scowcroft.   Throughout the coup, said Scowcroft, the administration was in``the fog of war. ... You are operating without a full deck ofintelligence information.''   Changes will be made to avoid a repeat, he said, but did notspell out what steps were planned.   ``We're not happy,'' Scowcroft said. ``We certainly hope Noriegawill not remain in power. ... He is a dangerous symbol.   ``Our procedures, and in some cases some organizational things,ought to be improved as a result of it, and we will be doingthat,'' he said.   Although the rebels said they did not want open U.S. help, theydid ask American forces to block two of three overland routes tothe Noriega's headquarters.   ``The plotters came in and said, `we do not want American help.We do not want our action tainted by being involved with the UnitedStates. All we want you to do is just sort of keep thereinforcements from these two roads,''' Scowcroft said.   U.S. forces deployed to block the two roads designated by theplotters, but Bush decided that further use of uniformed Americantroops to aid the rebels was too dangerous, Scowcroft said.   ``The two roads that we blocked, the causeway and the bridgeover the canal, are ... bottlenecks. They are easy to isolate. Theyare areas within our exercise area. ... Clearly, they are they arethings that can be done within our general treaty authorities,''said Scowcroft, referring to the 1977 pact turing over the PanamaCanal to the Panamanians.   ``The third route is very different. ... It is down through theheart of old Panama City, multiple routes, crowded city, to dothat, and outside the area where U.S. troops move and exercise,that have been the overt exercise of military force, perhaps into afire fight, to block them in the heart of a heavily populatedarea,'' Scowcroft said.</TEXT></DOC>
