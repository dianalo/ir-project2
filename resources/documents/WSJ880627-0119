Yang (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> EXE </G><DATELINE> DENVER  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Backers of Michael Dukakis took full control in drafting the Democratic Party platform, brushing aside Jesse Jackson's effort to move the party to the left. But both sides played down the prospect of any divisive policy battles at next month's convention.    Finishing work on the party's basic statement of ideas and goals, the 186-member platform committee produced a short document that avoided specifics, rebuffing Mr. Jackson's position on taxes, defense spending, the use of nuclear weapons and a homeland for Palestinians.    Some Dukakis advisers privately say they would welcome a challenge on any of those issues during the Atlanta convention. They reason that they have the votes to prevail, and that turning back such efforts by Mr. Jackson would help them counter claims by Vice President George Bush that Mr. Dukakis is too liberal.    Speaking in Puerto Rico, Mr. Jackson indicated there will be challenges over the platform next month. &quot;I don't think bland is beautiful,&quot; he said. &quot;People ought to make promises; people ought to keep promises.&quot;    He said, &quot;There no doubt will be some minority positions&quot; taken to platform discussions at the convention, but that it was &quot;premature&quot; to say what those issues would be. Nevertheless, Mr. Jackson reiterated that he doesn't expect any &quot;bloodletting&quot; because of the platform.    Even as Gov. Dukakis was standing firm on the platform here, the expected Democratic presidential nominee was giving in to Mr. Jackson on changing rules for selecting delegates to the 1992 Democratic convention as the party's rules committee met in Washington.    That victory, and the way the Dukakis campaign is treating him, could influence Mr. Jackson's decision whether to press his policy differences with Mr. Dukakis at the convention. &quot;It's all part of an overall strategy decision,&quot; said Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Georgetown University law professor who represented Mr. Jackson at the platform proceedings.    Other factors to be considered, she said, would be how the Massachusetts governor receives Mr. Jackson's &quot;advice and counsel&quot; on the vice presidency and the effect a fight would have on Mr. Dukakis's chances for victory Nov. 8. &quot;It all goes into the computer,&quot; said Mrs. Norton, adding that the ultimate decision will be the candidate's. &quot;What counts is the final victory we shall achieve in November.&quot;    In general, Jackson strategists said they are pleased with the way the Dukakis campaign is treating them. Adviser Ann Lewis praised the &quot;atmosphere of respect and fair play&quot; that surrounded both the platform and the rules discussions. &quot;We knew the math,&quot; Ms. Lewis said. &quot;We wanted the fairest, the best opportunity to state our case. We've had that.&quot;    Said Mrs. Norton: &quot;We have achieved our goal to get Jackson's views in the platform.&quot;    Jackson campaign officials contrast this year to Mr. Jackson's treatment at the hands of Democratic nominee Walter Mondale four years ago. While Messrs. Dukakis and Jackson speak directly, Mr. Mondale designated aides to deal with Mr. Jackson in 1984.    A potential problem arose over the weekend, though, after newspapers reported, and Democratic Party officials confirmed, that Texas Treasurer Ann Richards would be named as the convention's keynote speaker, perhaps as soon as today. Mr. Jackson complained that he hadn't been consulted about the decision. &quot;Our constituency has every reason to be insulted,&quot; he told the Atlanta Journal and Constitution.    But during the daylong platform proceedings Saturday, which were free of acrimony, the Dukakis and Jackson campaigns found some areas of agreement, pledging, for instance, to set a specific date for U.S. corporations to leave South Africa. To counter charges by Mr. Bush, who has wrapped up the GOP nomination, that Mr. Dukakis is soft on crime, the two camps also agreed on language promising increased federal aid to local police and a ban on &quot;cop-killer&quot; bullets.    But to avoid giving Mr. Bush ammunition for his charges that Mr. Dukakis is eager to raise taxes and is weak on defense, the platform committee voted 108-44 to reject a provision proposed by Mr. Jackson's supporters calling for higher taxes on corporations and wealthy Americans and a freeze on Pentagon spending.    On a succession of voice votes, the platform committee turned back efforts by Mr. Jackson's supporters to add many of his campaign positions to the document. Among them were a call for &quot;self-determination for Israelis and Palestinians&quot; and a pledge that the U.S. wouldn't be the first to use nuclear weapons in a conflict.    The panel also rejected attempts to include such specific commitments for spending programs as doubling federal education funding and making Head Start, currently a grant program, an entitlement program.    The result is a broadly worded document of about 4,000 words, one-tenth the length of either the 1980 or 1984 party platforms. &quot;A wise man once said, 'Brevity is the soul of victory,'&quot; said Theodore Sorenson, the former John Kennedy speech writer who drafted the document.    Alabama Rep. Tom Bevill was more down-to-earth: &quot;No one has ever been defeated for something he didn't say.&quot;    The changes adopted by the rules committee in Washington had been worked out in private negotiations between the Jackson and Dukakis campaigns. They are designed to answer Mr. Jackson's complaints that current provisions unfairly kept him from getting as many delegates as he should have.    The revisions, which will be presented to the party's convention for approval, would require all states to award delegates to presidential candidates in proportion to their support in the primaries and caucuses in 1992. In addition, the number of party officials who automatically become delegates to the 1992 convention would be sharply cut.    &quot;I'm very, very pleased,&quot; Ms. Lewis, the Jackson adviser, said in Denver. &quot;Every concern we've voiced has been addressed.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
