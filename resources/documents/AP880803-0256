(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Environmental activists, claimingretailers have been playing ``hide and seek with consumer health,''said they will try to force stores to post cancer warnings for 225tobacco products, mostly cigars and pipe tobacco.   Three environmental groups and Tom Hayden's Campaign Californiapolitical organization announced plans Tuesday to file a $1.3billion lawsuit against eight major retail chains and 27 tobaccocompanies, claiming they have failed to adequately warn customersabout risks in the tobacco products.   They took the action under a ``citizen's suit'' provision ofProposition 65, a controversial 1986 ballot measure that requireswarnings for a long list of substances believed to cause cancer orbirth defects.   Proposition 65 allows private parties to sue under itsprovisions if prosecutors fail to act after receiving 60 daysnotice from the potential plaintiffs.   David Roe, an attorney for the Environmental Defense Fund, andCarl Pope of the Sierra Club announced at a news conference thatthey were giving that notice. ``If they don't act, we will,'' Roesaid.   Proposition 65 allows fines of up to $2,500 a day for aviolation. Pope and Roe said the $1.3 billion figure used by theirgroups was a ``fairly conservative estimate of the maximumpotential liability'' faced by the chains and tobacco companies.   Pope said the groups targeted the 225 tobacco products becausethey do not carry federally required package warnings likecigarettes do and have a well-documented cancer risk.   Leslie Howe, vice president for governmental affairs for theCalifornia Retailers Association, declined to discuss the issue.``This is the type of thing that attorneys talk to other attorneysabout,'' he said.   A Tobacco Institute representative in Sacramento did not returna reporter's phone call.   But Norman F. Sharp, president of the Cigar Association ofAmerica and the Pipe Tobacco Council, told The New York Times thetobacco industry took ``great pains'' to comply with the law,placing advertisements in 58 newspapers across the state andsending out more than a million notices for retailers to place onshelves.   The eight chains targeted by the environmentalists areAlbertson's Inc., the Alpha Beta Co., Lucky Stores Inc., Raley's,Ralphs Grocery Co., Safeway Stores Inc., Thrifty Drug and DiscountStores and Vons Grocery Co.   Roe said group representatives had been in some stores operatedby the chains and had not found warning signs for the tobaccoproducts.   Tobacco companies cited by the groups include R.J. Reynolds,United States Tobacco Co., Consolidated Cigar Co. and General CigarCo.</TEXT></DOC>
