The FCC had sent US Sprint a letter last month warning the phonecompany that it faced sanctions unless it did a better jobresponding to billing complaints.   The agency ordered US Sprint to explain the procedures it has inplace to investigate complaints forwarded by the FCC and outlinewhat steps the company intended to take to speed resolution ofthese complaints.   In response to the letter, US Sprint earlier this week told theFCC it is getting fewer complaints about billing problems and thatthe problems are being resolved more quickly.   The FCC's concern focused on the complaints that the agencyreceives from US Sprint customers and forwards to the company. Atthe time the letter was sent, Vogt said these complaints likelywere far fewer than the number of customer complaints sent directlyto US Sprint.   But US Sprint says it is well on the way to resolving thebilling problems that plagued the company after it was formed inJuly 1986 as a joint venture of GTE Corp.'s Sprint and UnitedTelecommunications' US Telecom. United Telecommunications will takea majority ownership of US Sprint later this year.   US Sprint officials have blamed much of their billing problemson the merging of the two phone systems.   ``We think the severe billing problems we had in the past arepretty much behind us,'' said Leon Kestenbaum, a US Sprint vicepresident who met with FCC officials about the matter on Wednesday.   ``There are always going to be some things that aren't perfect,but basically we think the problem is well over 90 percentsolved,'' he said.   Vogt said the agency was ``very pleased'' with US Sprint'sefforts to resolve quickly customer complaints about bills. Headded that the FCC will continue to monitor the company'sperformance and ``we'll see in the next few months whether theylive up to their promises.''   US Sprint is the nation's third-largest long-distance companyafter American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and MCI CommunicationsCorp.</TEXT></DOC>
