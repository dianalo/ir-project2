A siteat Zanker and Highway 237 is probably a good one, especially if it is next toa future light rail station.;    However, there is a better site that willtake advantage of a number of future transportation improvements. Nobodyenjoys sitting in traffic before or after a game.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  BRING THE GIANTS TO MILPITAS FORD PLANT  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Letters to the Editor  </MEMO><TEXT>     In the next several years, an interchange at I-880 and Tasman Drive will bebuilt and extended to Capitol Expressway to the east. Light rail could beextended, as is being planned, and be in service by late 1996. And finally,BART can be extended from Fremont to meet the light rail extension.;    At thepoint where all these improvements come together sits a large parcel ofunder-utilized industrial property mostly used for parking. They used to makeFords there.;    This site would be served by two freeways, two majorarterials and two mass transportation systems instead of one. This site wouldsurely have less environmental impact than one built on undeveloped property.It would also be preferable for having less wind and odor.;    I hope the blueribbon panel charged with finding a stadium site, will consider the Fordproperty at Capitol Expressway and Main Street in Milpitas as a possibility,and not let political boundaries prevent them from making the best choice.;   -- Neal Johnson; Pleasanton  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910626  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  236  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday June 26, 199100178005,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
