Ortega, whose country has become the Western Hemisphere'spoorest, promised better times ahead and said Nicaraguans are betteroff today than before July 19, 1979, when Sandinista guerrillasmarched victoriously into Managua.   He called on President Bush to dismantle the U.S.-backed Contrarebels, most of whom are in neighboring Honduras, and even praisedsome opposition leaders who joined the Sandinistas at the start ofthe revolution then left it, feeling betrayed.   About 200,000 people gathered at a huge plaza along the shores ofLake Managua on Wednesday for a rally, the highlight of otherwiselackluster 10th anniversary celebrations.   Observers who have been at other anniversary celebrations saidmost of those attending the 90-minute rally were either partyloyalists or public employees afraid of losing their jobs if theydidn't show up.   Ortega, who estimated the crowd at more than 300,000, said thelarge number showed the Sandinistas have at least that many votesassured for general elections set for Feb. 25.   The Sandinista show of strength at the rally might scare theopposition into abstaining from the ballot, Ortega said.   ``But let's all be very clear about this ... they can take orleave the elections, but there will be elections on Feb. 25, 1990,''he said. ``And they will be clean and honest elections, like theones in 1984.''   In a 50-minute speech, Ortega said his government is controllinginflation, which ``is not smashing us as is happening in othercountries.''   Inflation in Nicaragua surpassed 20,000 percent in 1988, butstiff austerity measures brought it down to a monthly rate of 12percent in June.   However, the cost has been high. The government has fired 35,000public employees and tightened credit restrictions and publicspending.   Foreign aid has decreased. A 10-country European tour in Apriland May from which Ortega hoped to get $250 million for the countryto survive the year, produced just $50 million.   Nevertheless, at the end of his speech, Ortega proclaimed: `Todaythe people are better off than before 1979.   ``Better days will come,'' he added.   Ortega did not elaborate and left the promises fluttering in thecool morning breeze from the lake.   He accused the United States of continuing its ``imperialistaggression'' against Nicaragua by maintaining a commercial blockadeand blocking credit.   ``The United States still hasn't decided to be respectful of therights of the nations of the Third World ... and of Nicaragua.   ``If the president of the United States is for peace ... heshould stop immediately his policy of war against the people ofNicaragua and allow the Contras to be dismantled from Honduranterritory.''   Most of the U.S.-backed rebels are known to have moved to junglecamps in neighboring Honduras after their leaders and theSandinistas signed a temporary truce in March 1988. Contra bandsstill roam northern and central Nicaragua and sporadic skirmishesstill are reported.   Ortega gave guarded praise to three members of the five-memberjunta that took control after dictator Anastasio Somoza fled thecountry on July 17, 1979. The three later left the junta, leavingonly Ortega and current Vice President Sergio Ramirez.   Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, a powerful symbol of upper-classunity with the Sandinistas against Somoza and now the leadingcontender for opposition presidential candidate, resigned April 19,1980.   She said the Sandinistas' goals were incompatible with her hopesfor a democratic Nicaragua.   Ortega said Wednesday that Mrs. Chamorro's decision not to accept``conditions that the gringos wanted to impose on the junta'' was``firm and courageous.''   Mrs. Chamorro's family owns the opposition newspaper La Prensa,shut down several times during by Somoza regime and again by theSandinistas. It did not publish on Wednesday.</TEXT></DOC>
