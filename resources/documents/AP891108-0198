East Germans disillusioned by 40 years of rigid rule andskeptical of promises continued leaving in droves. Pro-reformgroups pleaded with their countrymen to stay and help ``build areal democratic society,'' but more than 50,000 had arrived in WestGermany since Saturday.   Krenz made a stinging attack on his predecessor and mentor,Erich Honecker, and Communist authorities took the first stepstoward registering New Forum, the nation's largest pro-democracygroup.   Officials in Frankfurt an der Oder legalized New Forum locallyand the local Christian Democrats, a small party previously alliedwith the Communists, gave them space in its building, the officialnews agency ADN reported.   The party propaganda chief said free elections might be possible.   ADN said 25,000 people in Neubrandenburg rallied for freeelections, greeting the leadership's decisions with whistles, and15,000 protested in Limbach-Oberfrohna, near Karl-Marx-Stadt.   ``Our country is going through a tense and extremely difficultdevelopment,'' Krenz told the Central Committee, which unanimouslyapproved his proposal to dissolve the 21-member Politburo and forma smaller one.   Central Committee members reaffirmed Krenz, 52, as party leaderand announced the election of an 11-member Politburo. Krenz and sixother Politburo members were re-elected.   Four new members chosen for the Politburo, the nation's mostpowerful body, included Hans Modrow, the 61-year-old Dresden partychief said to be a leading advocate of reform.   Modrow was proposed for the post of premier, which has beenempty since Tuesday's resignation of Premier Willi Stoph, 75, andthe entire Council of Ministers, or Cabinet.   Parliament's presidium was to meet Thursday to set a date toelect a new Cabinet.   In Washington, deputy White House press secretary Roman Popadiuksaid the Bush administration hoped the shakeup ``is a step on theroad to stable and evolutionary reform.''   The aging Politburo members dropped were closely associated withHonecker, 77, whom Krenz replaced Oct. 18. They included Stoph;ideology chief Kurt Hager; Erich Mielke, head of the dreadedsecurity apparatus, and Parliament speaker Horst Sinderman.   Krenz accused the old guard of ``hesitant, even repellingattitudes'' and said: ``Wrong judgments were made about thesituation, and there was no reaction to questions long posed bydaily life.''   Independent, non-Communist groups would be allowed a greaterrole in society, Krenz said, because ``the Politburo thinks thatcitizens' movements that are within the constitution should belegalized.''   It was unclear how much power any such group would have becausethe constitution guarantees the leading role of the CommunistParty, and Krenz has said that is not open to debate.   The Interior Ministry has accepted New Forum's application to belegalized and the ministry will decide in three months. New Forumwas outlawed in September, but has been tolerated of late.   Krenz has been under growing pressure at home and abroad toallow free, multiparty elections like those held in Poland andplanned for Hungary.   Politburo member Guenter Schabowski, the party's new propagandachief and one of those re-elected, said such elections werepossible.   ``When we have an election law that gives all political forcesthe opportunity to draw up and represent their own programs, theCommunist Party will stand,'' he said.   Schabowski, the East Berlin party chief and a leading reformadvocate, gave no timetable or details, and said the party wouldnot embark on such a course ``with the suicidal notion that itcould be swept from the political stage.''   In Bonn, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl offered badly neededfinancial support to East Germany if the Communists surrender theirmonopoly on power.   ``We are not prepared to support a system that has lost itslegitimacy,'' Kohl said. ``But we are prepared to offerfar-reaching help if genuine and thorough-going political andeconomic reforms take root.''   The Central Committee decisions and Krenz's speech were reportedby the state news agency ADN. The Central Committee, which approvesleadership and major policy changes, has 163 members, but only 157attended Wednesday's session.   On the West German border Wednesday, police said 50,000 EastGermans had arrived since Saturday, when the Communist governmentallowed them to go West via Czechoslovakia. It was the first timeEast Germany opened a direct channel to the West since theCommunists built the Berlin Wall in 1961.   Nearly 200,000 mostly young East Germans have left their countrythis year, either by emigrating legally, or by fleeing throughHungary, Czechoslovakia or Poland. West Germany grants East Germansautomatic citizenship and helps them start new lives.   In a dramatic appearance on national TV, author Christa Wolfread an appeal from five unofficial, pro-reform groups, includingNew Forum, to East Germans to stay in their homeland.   ``Help us to build a real democratic society,'' Ms. Wolf said.``We need you ... have confidence in yourself and in us, stayhere.''</TEXT></DOC>
