The bank, plagued by a huge portfolio of nonperformingassets, said that it will add about $175 million to its loanloss reserves to offset continuing problems in the soft NewEngland real estate market.</LP><TEXT>   The third-quarter numbers, according to bank officials,will be bleak: it will lose up to $250 million. In theyear-earlier quarter, the company had a loss of $125 million.In the next few months, 1,500 employees, 8% of the bank'swork force, are expected to leave under a voluntary programof severance enhancements. The dividend, which the bankclaims is the longest standing in North America, continuouslypaid since 1785, will drop from 31 cents a share to a dime.   &quot;This corporation is clearly in a position to absorb thesekinds of problems -- even if they continue for a while,&quot; saidChairman and Chief Executive Officer Ira Stepanian. He addedthat the bank's actions yesterday, especially in terms ofincreasing loan loss reserves, &quot;ought to give people a senseof comfort. Will it? Probably not.&quot;   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,Bank of Boston shares closed at $7.125, down 37.5 cents.   The crux of the bank's problems are in its portfolio ofnonperforming assets. The bank's reduction of nonperformingassets by $100 million to $1.85 billion was due tocharge-offs of about $175 million in bad loans and another$35 million in real estate now owned by the bank. ChiefFinancial Officer Peter Manning says that the inflow of freshnonperformers has been slowing a bit, although it is still inthe hundreds of millions for the quarter.   &quot;Their nonperforming asset total has been kept level, butat a painful level,&quot; said James Moynihan, an analyst withAdvest Inc. &quot;When you realize the cost of thosenonperformers, in legal fees, much less the interest you muststill pay to depositers for holding their money, it's justastounding.&quot; Carrying nonperformers costs the bank about $180million annually.   The bank has also put aside $50 million in restructuringcosts, most of which will be paid in severance packages tothe 1,500 employees slated to leave by early 1991. Bankofficials said those employed for at least 10 years will beoffered the severance package, though it won't be extended tosenior management.   The bank said the moves it is making will reduce itsnoninterest expense level by at least $100 million annually.   &quot;These are very disturbing numbers, not just for Bank ofBoston but for all banks in the country with an exposure incommerical real estate,&quot; said Gerard Cassidy, an analyst withTucker, Anthony andamp; R.L. Day in Portland, Maine. &quot;It shows badloans are still flowing in the front door -- that we haven'thit bottom yet. To keep things under control, the bank willhave to continue to eat into its capital position.&quot;   Richard Syron, chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank ofBoston, said recently that the region's economic slide isstill a year away from hitting bottom. The concern amongbankers in New England is that another year of high realestate exposure, weak earnings and deteriorating creditquality will eat away at the capital that serves as a bank'sfinancial cushion.   On that score, the Bank of Boston, the region's largestbank with $37 billion in assets, has few worries. Its capitallevel is strong, at over 9% of total assets.</TEXT></DOC>
