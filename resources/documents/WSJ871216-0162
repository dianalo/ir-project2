But a company official cautioned that the idea &quot;is in the earliest, preliminary, trial balloon stages.&quot;    Soviet government representatives contacted Ford &quot;a few months ago,&quot; expressing interest in a joint production venture, a company spokesman said. Ford has yet to reply formally to the inquiry, the spokesman said.    The U.S. State and Commerce departments are aware of the contacts, and have indicated they have no problem with discussions of trade in nonstrategic items, the Ford spokesman said. A communique issued after the recent summit meeting contained similar language, the company spokesman said.    But Ford is concerned that any venture could be scuttled by a sudden shift in U.S.-Soviet relations. &quot;The risk of something like the Afghanistan situation&quot; derailing a commercial venture &quot;is very real,&quot; the Ford spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
