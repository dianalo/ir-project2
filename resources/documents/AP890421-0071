Several thousand radical students took part in fierce clashes atfour major colleges in Seoul, surging out of the campuses to attackriot police who fired volleys of tear gas and hurled rocks back atthe protesters.   ``Punish Roh Tae-woo!'' and ``Yankee go home!'' the studentsyelled as they beat drums and brass gongs in the third day ofserious campus protests in Seoul and other cities.   Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, said hundreds of studentsalso clashed with police in the southeastern cities of Kwangju andIri.   Police officials said there had been some injuries, but they hadno figures on injuries or arrests.   The Defense Ministry announced earlier today it would mobilizeup to 80,000 military technicians to keep key industries running ifworkers go on strike. The government has warned that growing laborunrest could cause major economic damage and foment unrest.   Students staged protests at colleges in Seoul to support laborstrikes and demand the overthrow of the conservative Rohgovernment. Student leaders called for a major drive by oppositiongroups to oust Roh.   More than 1,000 students hurling hundreds of firebombs and rocksbattled riot police for more than two hours in the streets aroundKonkuk University in eastern Seoul. Police trucks with multipletear gas launchers repeatedly fired barrages of choking gas todrive the protesters back onto the campus.   Police battled about 1,000 students at Hankook University whocharged out wielding iron pipes and wooden clubs and hurlingfirebombs. Similar clashes were reported by college officials atSeoul National and Yonsei universities.   The students claim the Roh government is a front for militaryrule and are calling for a popular uprising to topple theadministration. But the radicals and allied dissident groups lackpopular support because of their violence and extreme views.   The students are not seen as a serious threat to the government,even though they have been staging almost daily violent protests.   Roh and other government leaders are worried about the radicals'efforts to build an alliance with militant trade unions that havebeen staging strikes for higher pay and better working conditions.The government says strikes in recent months have cost the economy$2 billion in lost production.   The Defense Ministry statement today said it would use militaryengineers and other technicians to keep vital industries running ifhit by strikes. The government said earlier this week that it woulduse troops to keep important industries operating.</TEXT></DOC>
