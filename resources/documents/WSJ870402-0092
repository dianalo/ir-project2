The company said it is weighing several alternatives, including a restructuring, leveraged buyout or another suitor.    In addition, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Conrac said its board adopted a resolution instructing management not to disclose the possible terms of any such transactions or proposals and not to name the parties involved &quot;unless and until an agreement in principle&quot; is reached. The filing said premature disclosure &quot;might jeopardize the continuation of any discussions or negotiations that the corporation may conduct.&quot;    The electronics concern, which called last week's unsolicited Mark IV bid &quot;not in the best interest of Conrac and its shareholders,&quot; said none of its directors or executives intends to tender any shares under the offer, which expires 12:01 a.m. EST April 21. The board said its decision was based partly on an opinion of Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., its financial adviser, that the offer is inadequate.    A spokesman for Mark IV said the company was studying Conrac's rejection of its offer and wouldn't comment further. Mark IV, an Amherst, N.Y., maker of industrial and defense-related products, currently holds 670,400, or 9.9%, of Conrac's 6.8 million common shares outstanding.    Conrac, which makes electronic products and systems for computer-related information-display and communication markets, had 1986 net income of $7.8 million, or $1.16 a share, on revenue of $153.9 million.    In its SEC filing, Conrac said it entered into so-called golden-parachute severance agreements with Paul E. Graf, president and chief executive officer, and two other executives. Conrac also set up a severance-pay plan for 30 other employees.    Mark IV has said it expects to report net for its year ended Feb. 28 of more than $10 million, or $1.20 a share, on sales of more than $290 million.    In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Conrac shares closed at $29.50, up 62.5 cents. In American Stock Exchange composite trading, Mark IV closed at $17.875, up 50 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
