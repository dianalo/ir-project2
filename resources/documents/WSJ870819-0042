Investors have expected Kenner to reject the New World offer and come up with something better. Kenner's stock has traded well above the $41 tender offer price since mid-July.    Yesterday, Kenner stock closed at $47.25, up $1.375, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.    &quot;Clearly they're suggesting holders can do better based on the strategies the company is going to follow,&quot; said Steven Eisenberg, an analyst with Bear Stearns andamp; Co. &quot;Wall Street believes the $41 offer doesn't take into consideration the real value that exists in Kenner,&quot; he added.    In Los Angeles, a spokesman for New World said the company had no immediate response to the rejection. &quot;This is a legitimate tender offer for the company, and we will pursue it in the most businesslike fashion,&quot; James Zemelman, director of corporate legal affairs, said.    Mr. Zemelman said that New World, a comic book, movie and television company, plans to pursue its tender offer. It began the offer last Wednesday after two months of indicating its interest and buying up shares in the market.    Analysts have expressed puzzlement at why the company would make an offer that was far below the market price. New World has said it would be willing to meet with Kenner and negotiate on the price, and yesterday Kenner said it expects its representatives will meet with New World.    Kenner declined to specify what steps it will take. However, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, it said steps might include a merger with another company, an acquisition by Kenner, a sale of assets or a leveraged buy-out, among other options.    &quot;There are numerous options here,&quot; said David Leibowitz, an analyst with American Securities Corp. He suggested that Kenner might find a friendly acquirer or make an acquisition to become so big that it would be harder to acquire. He said no competing bidders have emerged since New World's announcement.    Some observers said they think that a leveraged buy-out in which management remains in charge is a strong possibility. In a leveraged buy-out, a borrower acquires a company with borrowed funds and repays it with proceeds from the acquired company. Mr. Eisenberg of Bear Stearns said he thinks such a transaction could have a value of $47 to $50 a share and added, &quot;Some on the street believe the company could LBO at prices slightly above $50 a share.&quot;    Kenner said it retained Dillon, Read andamp; Co. and Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. to explore options. It said it will pay each a fee of $1.1 million and will pay more in the case of certain transactions.    In its filings with the SEC, Kenner disclosed that it has provided severance agreements to certain management employees that would give them three years or more of salary and other benefits if they resign from the company following a change in control.    Kenner, which was spun off from General Mills Inc. in 1985, has turned around its operations. Analysts say it is expected to continue to report solid sales and earnings growth. </TEXT></DOC>
