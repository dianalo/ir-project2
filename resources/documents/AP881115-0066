A pool of prospective jurors was ordered to begin the selectionprocess again today in the trial to determine the blame for theAugust 1986 accident that killed 82 people.   ``I see some prejudice, some very genuine prejudice, to certainparties,'' said U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon, who declared amistrial Monday in the civil suit.   The new panel cannot hear any allegations that pilot WilliamKramer was dead or incapacitated before the accident, ruled Kenyon.   ``It's nothing more than a guess,'' he said at one point.   Kramer's private plane entered restricted airspace and hit anAeromexico airliner over Cerritos on Aug. 31, 1986. The pilot waskilled along with his wife and daughter, as well as 64 people on thejet and 15 on the ground.   In opening statements last week, Kramer lawyers said the pilotmay have died of heart failure two minutes before his plane collidedwith the jet.   That suggestion tainted the jury, alleged Justice Departmentlawyer Steven J. Riegel, who sought a mistrial. Riegel is defendingthe government in more than 70 lawsuits.   Although Kenyon denied the mistrial motion last Thursday, he didrule the Kramer family lawyers couldn't raise the death orincapacitation issue because it was purely speculative and theevidence couldn't support the scenario.   Riegel raised the mistrial motion again Monday. Kenyon grantedthe motion after several hours of argument.   The judge noted that the trial had just begun and no evidence hadbeen presented.   ``It seems to me much cleaner'' this way, Kenyon said, adding hedidn't want to take objecting parties ``kicking and screaming'' intothe rest of the trial, which is expected to last at least throughJanuary.   The trial will decide how to apportion liability in the crash soattorneys representing more than 75 plaintiffs can proceed withlawsuits.</TEXT></DOC>
