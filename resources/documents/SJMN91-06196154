It's not how he planned it when he began acting 50 years ago. Fame andfortune were just around the corner, but he always seemed to be on the wrongstreet.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Arts andamp; Books  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  IN WITH THE IN CROWD -- FINALLY  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Cover StoryAt Large  </MEMO><TEXT>     Not that Walker didn't manage a theatrical career filled with moments ofgreat satisfaction, great roles in great plays. He spent a half-century on thestage, a considerable portion of it in the Bay Area. But as for the gildedmovie business, he had just two tiny roles before this year.;    In ErichSegal's huge hit &quot;Love Story&quot; (1970), he was Dr. Shapely, the man who tellsRyan O'Neal the fateful news about Ali MacGraw.;    On the other end of thespectrum, there was the totally forgotten &quot;The Way We Live Now,&quot; a Barry Brownfilm.;    &quot;I played a publisher,&quot; says Walker, a sly grin on his weatheredface. &quot;The first week the film grossed some pitiful amount, like $1,000. Thesecond week it was down to $800.&quot;;    Things promise to look a whole lotbetter around Christmas, when a major new film, &quot;Prelude to a Kiss,&quot; opens inthe key markets in time for Academy Award consideration. This time Walker hasthe pivotal role of the mysterious old man who comes to the wedding of younglovers, played by Alec Baldwin and Meg Ryan, and transforms everyone's lives.;   How in the world did &quot;unknown&quot; 70-year-old Sydney Walker go from Bay Areajourneyman actor to one of the most fascinating screen roles in years? How didhe get on the right street and turn that corner?;    The affable Walker, neverone to whine and wonder, has his philosophical response: &quot;Let life find you,&quot;he says. &quot;It's better that way.&quot;;    Our tale today is about how lifesuddenly, mysteriously found Sydney Walker.;    WALKER was born inPhiladelphia in 1921. He never went to college, having decided at age 7 1/2 tobecome an actor.;    He says there must be something genetic in the decision.&quot;My grandfather was a fundamentalist minister. There's nothing more theatricalthan that.&quot;;    The first acting experience came at the Hedgerow Theater inPhiladelphia. World War II came next, and he served with the Third Army inEurope. The GI Bill paid for acting school.;    Walker, unable to find work inLos Angeles, came to San Francisco in 1950. &quot;It was foggy, and I fell inlove.&quot; He worked with the Interplayers, a repertory company.;    Walker is awonderful raconteur, talking about his career in fascinating detail,mentioning parts and playhouses. He seems to have approached every role withdelight, or at least it seems so in his telling of it now.;    He laughs aboutsummer stock in Pennsylvania where he did 15 plays in 15 weeks -- a survivalcourse, he says.;    He laughs about soap opera roles: Dr. Bruce Benning on&quot;The Guiding Light&quot; and Msgr. Quinn on &quot;The Secret Storm.&quot;;    &quot;They weregoing to call that show 'The Storm Within,' Walker says, &quot;but then the primesponsor was Alka Seltzer so they thought better of it.&quot;;    Anyway, Walker'scharacter died of pneumonia so Walker could go work with the Lincoln CenterRep.;    &quot;I loved it all, and soap opera -- that's the last form of authenticAmerican folklore -- it paid for the down payment on my house.&quot;;    Walkerseems to have a perpetual grin, and he had it long before these days ofnewfound fame. Everyone talks about him as a &quot;sweet&quot; man. He was a wonderfulScrooge for the American Conservatory Theater's &quot;A Christmas Carol,&quot; an annualevent, turning that nasty gent into a beloved Santa Claus.;    Walker spentfive years in New York in the '60s working with Ellis Rabb's esteemed APA(Association of Producing Artists) company. The company had a Hall of Fameroster of actors, including Helen Hayes, Eva Le Gallienne, Donald Moffat andNancy Walker. Nancy is not a relative, but Sydney relishes a review by WalterKerr that included a laudatory paragraph, beginning: &quot;Now a word about theWalkers . . .&quot;;    Other periods of time in New York were spent working lesscreatively with U.S. Customs, checking ship manifestos.;    Then &quot;on mysister's birthday in 1970,&quot; Walker got a call from ACT's William Ball, thefounder and artistic director: &quot; 'Sydney, I don't know if this is the secondor third time I've invited you to join ACT, but I won't take 'no' for ananswer.' &quot;;    Walker has worked with ACT for 16 years. He took breaks toperform &quot;Nathan the Wise,&quot; an 18th-century play by Gotthold Ephraim Lessingwhich Walker adapted, at the Sunnyvale Rep. And he played Prospero inShakespeare's &quot;The Tempest&quot; with the San Jose Repertory Theater at the Centerfor the Performing Arts.;    OK, now about that corner he turned.;    A coupleof years ago, Walker was asked by Berkeley Rep artistic director Sharon Ott toplay the old man in &quot;Prelude to a Kiss&quot; in Berkeley. The Craig Lucas play hadbeen done successfully at the South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa, anddirector Norman Rene was reproducing it here.;    Walker says the script&quot;fused right away -- it's a marvelous part in a marvelous play.&quot;;    It's anaturalistic story that suddenly turns into a mystical fairy tale: Boy meetsand woos lovely girl, but on their wedding day, at which an uninvited old manis present, the bride's soul and spirit are mysteriously transposed into thebody of this strange, uninvited man. And the man's spirit is transferred toher body, leaving the young groom confused and distraught.;    As written byplaywright Lucas, this isn't a silly comedy. Lucas is asking us to deal withthe essence of love and commitment in a marriage. What is love, and where doesit go when youth disappears? The affirmation of genuine caring proves to bequite moving.;    The Berkeley Rep reviews were ecstatic, and the play wasextended. And then it was taken to New York by the Circle Repertory.;   Walker himself, however, despite the rave reviews, was not invited to go withthe play. It seems the Circle Rep wanted to use its own players, and one wasBarnard Hughes, in the part of the old man. &quot;They said it would insult Hughesif they didn't use him,&quot; Walker says.;    Mary Louise Parker, another standoutas the young girl in both the South Coast Rep and Berkeley Rep productions,did get the New York opportunity -- and a Tony Award.;    Bad memories; Walker later was asked to replace Hughes for various lengths of time as theplay moved from off-Broadway to Broadway. But the money was poor, or at leastnot enough to erase Walker's memory of having been mugged a couple of times onNew York streets.;    Another explanation: &quot;After a fine career in New York, Ididn't want to return by sneaking in the back door.&quot;;    People from a laterChicago production also called Walker, but the actor, who loves to tend hisgarden, didn't want to face a Windy City winter.;    &quot;I really don't have tohave it,&quot; Walker remembers thinking. &quot;Let someone else experience it.&quot;;   When the movie was being planned, Walker was rehearsing last season's ACTproduction of &quot;1918.&quot; The role of the old man in the film had gone to AlecGuinness, and there was nothing he could say about that.;    But Guinness'wife became seriously ill, and the English actor had to bow out of theproject. According to Walker, director Rene told the producers he could nowhave the actor he wanted all along. Rene &quot;went to bat for me. The producerssuggested a screen test. But Norman said, 'No, I want Walker.';    &quot;So theonly negotiations were about money. Of course, I wasn't going to get paid whatGuinness was going to get paid. I was told that the way you negotiate is toask for twice as much as you hope to get. My agent said we should try to get$75,000. So we asked for $150,000.;    &quot;We didn't get it. But we got a lotmore than $75,000.&quot;;    Another gleeful grin crosses Walker's face. It's ahuge payday for him, though nothing record-breaking for Hollywood.;    Walkerrelishes talking about the filming, obviously a unique experience for aworkaday stage actor. He was picked up every morning in a personal limousine.He was housed each night in a comfy suite at the Ambassador East in Chicago,where the film was shot because of a New York union dispute.;    &quot;On the set,there was another sort of role reversal, between Baldwin and me. He's 33, buthe was the daddy, instructing me. He would speak for me and demand my rightsif they asked me to work too hard. He said I had to preserve my energy. Ifthey asked me to do another take at night, he'd say, 'Sydney can do that scenein the morning.' He was very protective of me.&quot;;    Walker worked threemonths, through July 8. There is some &quot;dubbing and publicizing&quot; still to do inplaces such as New York, Los Angeles and London. The film promises to getWalker the kind of attention he has never gotten.;    Indeed, Walker isdelighted with his good fortune. &quot;I feel it's a celebration,&quot; he says. &quot;I havebeen given a gigantic birthday present.&quot;;    A longtime bachelor, Walker wasmarried from 1952 to 1956, but he says the aspirations were mismatched.;   &quot;Marriage to my wife was the man coming home every night to a house behind awhite picket fence. You close the door at 6 o'clock. After that you are hers.For an actor, that doesn't work.&quot; There were no children, &quot;thank God.&quot;;   Walker seems a comfortable man, at ease with himself. He comes home when hecan and works in his garden. When his car was vandalized some years back, henever bought another one. And he says he isn't necessarily looking for anotherfilm.;    &quot;Don't say this film is the culmination of my career. It's been awonderful experience, but I don't insist that it happen again and again. Letthe thing be. I'm enjoying it.;    &quot;I don't need a limousine. I have my(public-transit) fast-pass. This is who I am. I'm a working actor who uses thebus and the subway.&quot;;    Competition fading;  But he grins and says that movieparts may be easier to get as he ages, &quot;because my competition is dying off.;   &quot;I have felt very fulfilled. I enjoy all sorts of things. I enjoy theReaders Digest videos I have been doing on national parks. I find that, too,is fulfilling. I like doing commercials. I like doing my gardening.;    &quot;Ikeep my oar in the water. Dammit, it was about time for something like this.But I don't need it, really. Not any more.;    &quot;That's the nice thing about myage. Let life find you. It's much better that way.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Murry Frymer column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910714  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,963  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday July 14, 199100196154,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
