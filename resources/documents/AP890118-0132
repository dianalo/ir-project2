The British government is stressing that it does not recognizethe PLO as the Palestinians' sole representative, does not supportthe creation of an independent Palestinian state, and has no plansfor Arafat to meet Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.   Newspaper accounts, as well as a government source, drew apicture of a prime minister who wants to leave Middle Eastpeacemaking to the Americans and appear neutral without seeming togo up against a minister in her own government.   Britain was criticized sharply by Israel this week over a meetingin Tunis between Arafat and William Waldegrave, a junior ForeignOffice minister, and the remarks Waldegrave made during and afterthe meeting.   The Israelis were particularly incensed to hear Waldegravesuggesting that Arafat and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israelboth were ex-terrorists.   Waldegrave warned Israel against ``clever-silly'' responses toArafat's new peacemaking posture, and said that if Israel failed tograsp the initiative it would be ``left behind.''   The tabloid Sun denounced Waldegrave's ``insulting attitudetoward Israel'' and the Evening Standard ran a cartoon showingBritish dignitaries from the archbishop of Canterbury downwardlining up to embrace Arafat.   Greville Janner, a veteran pro-Israel lawmaker, accusedWaldegrave of ``publicly lecturing and tactlessly attacking Israel'sdemocratically elected leaders while sitting beside a man who untilrecently was responsible for a series of savage terrorist attacks onIsrael's people.''   But other papers generally backed Waldegrave, and Janner,speaking in a parliamentary debate on the Middle East on Tuesdaynight, was a lone voice. Members of the governing Conservative Partyas well as opposition Laborites rallied around Waldegrave, and Mrs.Thatcher pointedly sat beside him through the debate.   As a member of Parliament Mrs. Thatcher represents Finchley, aLondon constituency with a large Jewish population, and is known toharbor strong personal affection for Israel.   But she already has disagreed with Israel on the PLO's recentdecision to recognize Israel and disavow terrorism, believing it isan opportunity Jerusalem should seize.   During the parliamentary debate, her contributions were guarded.She said she wanted both sides to sit down to peaceful negotiations,but cautioned that it would take a long time and that ``nothingcould be started before the new administration in the United Statesis well in position and has decided precisely what is its policy.''   The Times of London said Tuesday that Mrs. Thatcher was trying toavert a clash with Shamir and prevent the Tunis meeting, thehighest-level British-PLO encounter so far, from raising furtherdiplomatic heat.   On Wednesday, a government source speaking on condition ofanonymity indicated that the government did not want to carryWaldegrave's remarks further, and that the aim was now to ``pour oilon these troubled waters.''   The source insisted there was no change in Britain's policy ofnot recognizing the PLO as the Palestinians' sole representative,and its wish for Palestinian national aspirations to be met in aconfederation with Jordan, rather than through an independent state.The source also said Mrs. Thatcher, who has invited Shamir toLondon, had no plans to meet with Arafat.   The British are keen to knock down any notion that they aretrying to play broker.   They believe Mrs. Thatcher enjoys the respect of all the partiesinvolved, and that Britain still derives influence in the MiddleEast from its empire days.   But as the source put it Wednesday, London recognizes that ``thepeople with the real clout'' are the Americans.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Marcus Eliason is news editor in the AP's Londonbureau and previously was news editor for the AP bureau in Israel.</TEXT></DOC>
