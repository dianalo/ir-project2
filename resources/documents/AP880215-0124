GRAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Opening of negotiations and relativequiet on the warfront have sparked a glimmer of hope that twodecades of savage conflict in Cambodia can be solved throughpolitical compromise rather than more bloodshed.   After an 8-year-long stalemate, two rounds of peace talks wererecently held between key protagonists: Cambodian resistance leaderPrince Norodom Sihanouk and Prime Minister Hun Sen of the pro-Hanoiregime in Cambodia.   Vietnam, which invaded Cambodia in 1978, now says that if anacceptable political solution is reached, it may withdraw itstroops before an announced 1990 pull-out. And Moscow has indicatedit wants to heal itself of two festering Asian sores: Cambodia andAfghanistan.   Although negotiations in Paris last December and January did notproduce a mutually acceptable blueprint for peace, both sides saythey are working toward freedom from outside interference and anend to Cambodia's cycle of agony. Since 1970, Cambodia has suffereda devastating five-year war; a reign of terror by the Khmer Rouge;the Vietnamese invasion; and a continuing guerrilla war. Millionshave perished.   Deep suspicions of Vietnam's motives remain, as do fears of areturn to power of the brutal Khmer Rouge. And analysts are puzzledby the moves of the unpredictable prince, who on Jan. 30 resignedas head of a three-party resistance coalition and who regularlylashes out at his partners-in-war.   The 65-year-old Sihanouk _ onetime king, consummate survivor,enduringly popular leader _ headed a coalition of the communistKhmer Rouge, the Khmer People's National Liberation Front and hisown followers fighting the Vietnamese. China arms the coalition.The Soviet Union fuels Vietnam's war machine.   Stressing that Vietnam was eager to attract investment from theWest, Hanoi adviser Nguyen Xuan Oanh admitted recently the war inCambodia was ``a very costly proposition. It has drained ourresources.'' Besides the burden of keeping about 140,000 troops inCambodia, the opportunity costs are great: most non-Soviet blocnations continue to shun Vietnam, insisting on a troop withdrawalbefore engaging in full trade and aid relations with Hanoi.   Also widely seen as helping the process of political settlementare the rise of seemingly more flexible leaders: Mikhail Gorbachevin Moscow, Deng Xiaoping's followers in Peking, and VietnameseCommunist Party chief Nguyen van Linh in Hanoi. China cites theVietnamese grip on Cambodia as a key barrier to detente withMoscow, which appears to be seeking closer ties with Peking.   Changes are also perceived in the military situation. ``I can'ttell you who is winning the war in Cambodia ... but presently bothsides are turning to political means instead of fighting on thebattlefield,'' says Lt. Gen. Sihadaj Bunnag, spokesman ofThailand's military command.   Several Western analysts interviewed agree that in recent monthsfighting has decreased substantially, although reasons given forthis are largely speculative.   Rather than seeking combat, one theory says, the resistanceguerrillas are concentrating on grass-roots organization andpropaganda, trying to solidify support for their respective groupsin event action shifts to the political arena.   Militarily, the balance appears to be unchanged from recentyears: the estimated 50,000-strong fighters of the coalition can'tdefeat the Vietnamese but would probably rout the weak, pro-HanoiCambodian army if Hanoi pulled out. The Khmer Rouge remains themost powerful military force within the coalition.   For many Western and Thai analysts a ``worst case scenario''would be Vietnamese entrenchment in Cambodia; continued warfare;the indefinite existence of 250,000 Cambodian refugees along theThai-Cambodian border.   Perhaps the most optimistic future envisioned by Westernobservers is a Vietnamese pull-out; a coalition government inCambodia with Sihanouk as a major figure; and a withering away ofthe Khmer Rouge through defections of younger conscripts andgeneral hatred of a force robbed of its major appeal: fighting aforeign invader.   Sihanouk himself outlines a ``quadripartite provisionalgovernment,'' including the three coalition members and the Hun Senside. This foursome would work on organizing general electionsunder international supervision and be backed by a four-partynational army.   Sihanouk appears to be key to the question of peace or war inCambodia. He still enjoys widespread domestic popularity and by farthe greatest backing internationally among the coalition's leaders.His latest maneuvers may be designed to get the fractious coalitionsolidly behind his negotiation efforts.   Since his resignation, the two coalition partners have comebegging for his return. China, although the staunchest backer ofthe Khmer Rouge, stressed its support. Communist Party chief ZhaoZiyang praised Sihanouk as ``a great patriot and experiencedpolitician.'' Should the coalition sides ever compete for power inPhnom Penh, Sihanouk would need Peking's help in curbing the KhmerRouge.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Denis D.
