Maybe $60,000 to $70,000 to replaceeverything. Twenty or 30 rental apartments, all looted. Maybe$20,000 each for new contents. And two cars. I can't forgetabout the two cars.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The well-to-do businessman's shopping list, though large,isn't all that unusual in a rich nation occupied for sevenmonths not so much by an army of soldiers as an army ofthieves.   While much has been made of the $100 billion it will taketo rebuild Kuwait's battered infrastructure and industrialbase, additional mountains of cash will be needed to restockand refurnish the nation. Thus, by necessity, the Kuwaitisare poised to go on one of the greatest shopping sprees inhistory.   This portends huge opportunities for vendors here, thosein Saudi Arabia, Asia, Europe and, even the U.S., whose stockcouldn't be higher. Perhaps 60% of Kuwait's 600,000automobiles were stolen or cannibalized for parts. Virtuallyall of the thousands of houses left empty by those fleeingthe war were robbed of their contents. Nearly everygovernment building that wasn't burned or bombed was looted.Consumer goods were stolen.   &quot;Anything electronic, they stole it,&quot; says Mohammad Habebal-Qattan, a Kuwaiti engineer.   &quot;To replace all this? Such a number, how could I give itto you?&quot; says Taher al-Sahhaf, an associate professor ofchemical engineering at Kuwait University. Mr. al-Sahhaf isamong 20 or so university employees on a recent tour of theschool; prewar, it served 12,000 students, housed fivelibraries with perhaps three million books and claimed thefinest medical school in the Middle East.   The Iraqis stole virtually everything, including:furniture, computers and laboratory equipment.   Sighs Dr. Farida al-Awadi, dean of the university's schoolof applied medicine: &quot;How do you go about buying this manybooks? How can you even hope to find them all?&quot; Theuniversity's main library once held 700,000 volumes, but theIraqis took them all.   Some Kuwaitis are already beginning the effort to replacethe many stolen items. Kuwaiti officials, according toreports, have placed a $1.3 billion order with South Koreanfirms. While the order includes 33,000 refrigerators and3,000 tons of electrical cable and wire, it is mainly aimedat restocking this nation's salable supply of consumerelectronics. It's an eye-popping invoice: 60,000 colortelevisions, 60,000 videocassette recorders, 200,000radio/cassette players and four million batteries.   At the war-torn checkpoint on the Kuwaiti-Saudi Arabianborder, a six-truck convoy carrying new automobiles is seenawaiting clearance into the nation. &quot;These first cars will goto the ministers,&quot; says one Kuwaiti official there. &quot;Thepeople will have to wait longer.&quot;   In a vacant lot near this city's busy telephone bank --the only place Kuwaitis can make international calls --Ismail al-Sauq is trying to tap into the pent-up consumerdemand from the back of his Toyota station wagon.   The Kuwaiti merchant, whose clothing shop was sacked bythe Iraqis, is offering children's pajamas for $9 andpantyhose for $3 from stock he managed to hide during theoccupation. In a nearby truck, another Kuwaiti offersautomobile parts alongside bug sprayers, screwdrivers,nonalcoholic wine and sacks of lemons.   Business is brisk and the scene chaotic: two Kuwaitisoldiers -- eyeing the merchandise and not the road --collide in their jeeps.   It is only a temporary shortage of capital and a temporarylack of opportunity that prevents Kuwait from becoming onehuge shopping frenzy.   The problem for Mr. al-Sauq, on the other side of thecounter, is that like many modest Kuwaiti merchants, he issuffering a war-related cash-flow crisis. He would like tomake the short drive into Saudi Arabia to restock his goodsbut doesn't have the capital.   If Mr. al-Ansari, with his huge shopping list, is abellwether, America's merchants may fare well. Kuwaitis arealready fond of American cars -- a drive through Kuwait Cityis reminiscent of a drive through a well-to-do U.S. suburb,with full-size Chevrolets, Buicks and Cadillacs easilyoutnumbering the Toyotas, Hondas and Nissans.   Mr. al-Ansari lost two Japanese cars to the Iraqis, but&quot;on principle, I'm going to buy American cars,&quot; he says.   Some Kuwaitis also hold out slim hope of recovering someof their goods. In one of the more bizarre stories of Iraqioccupation, Kuwait University officials have uncoveredofficial Iraqi documents that disclose a squabble betweenIraqi medical schools in Basra and Baghdad over which wouldget the spoils from Kuwait's medical school.   According to the document, Saddam Hussein himself settledthe dispute by awarding the school's library books to Basra,and its equipment to Baghdad. If the Iraqi government isoverthrown and a &quot;responsible government&quot; comes to power, itmight be possible to recover some of the property, says oneuniversity official.</TEXT></DOC>
