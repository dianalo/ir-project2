Eight days after hearing arguments in Edward McNamara's case, thecourt dismissed his appeal in a one-sentence decision: ``The appealis dismissed for want of a properly presented federal question.''   There was no recorded dissent.   In his appeal, McNamara contended that his parental rights hadbeen terminated unconstitutionally by San Diego authorities.   The justices had been expected to use his case to decide whetherunwed fathers who actively seek custody of their children may bestripped of all parental rights if adoption is deemed in thechildren's best interest.   McNamara, who is 42, no longer was seeking custody of hisdaughter, Katie. He wanted to re-establish a parent-childrelationship so he could win visitation rights.   McNamara and Katie's mother, unidentified in court records, hadnot seen each other for eight months when Katie was born in 1981.McNamara did not learn of the pregnancy or birth until he was toldthat Katie, then a month old, had been placed in a foster homeawaiting adoption.   He quickly sought custody.   Katie was five months old before a trial was held on McNamara'scustody request, and a California judge ruled that it was in Katie'sbest interest to stay with the foster parents with whom she had beenliving.   The foster parents wanted to adopt Katie, and the judge ruledthat the baby girl had ``bonded'' with them.   The judge acknowledged that McNamara was a ``good parent (who)can provide a good, loving home for the child.''   The California Supreme Court reversed the ruling, stating thatcustody could not be awarded to a non-parent unless awarding custodyof the child to one of its parents who sought custody would bedetrimental to the child.   The state's highest court sent the case back to a trial court todetermine whether the passage of time had made an award of custodyto McNamara detrimental for Katie, by then adopted.   The trial court in 1985 ruled against McNamara, and stripped himof all parental rights to Katie. The judge, however, encouragedKatie's adoptive parents to make McNamara part of her life.   In arguments before the justices Nov. 28, McNamara's lawyercontended that California law unfairly discriminates against unwedfathers by making it more difficult for them to assert their rightsas parents.   San Diego County had defended the state's policy of giving anunwed mother the primary right to decide whether to surrender a chidfor adoption.   ``Biology in and of itself does not create a substantialrelationship or create a parental right,'' Lloyd Harmon Jr. hadargued for the county.   The case is McNamara vs. San Diego County Department of SocialServices, 87-5840.</TEXT></DOC>
