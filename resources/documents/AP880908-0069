(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Florida middleman arranging overseasfinancing for Jim Bakker's $172 million bid to buy back PTL hasbeen convicted of fraud and has a long criminal record, atelevision station reported.   The report Wednesday night by WBTV in Charlotte comes on the eveof deadlines today and Friday for Bakker, the leading bidder forthe embattled ministry's assets, to prove he can carry through onhis offer.   ``(There's) one complication after another, sort of like a soapopera,'' M.C. ``Red'' Benton, PTL's bankruptcy trustee, saidWednesday.   Benton said he was concerned over the report that Louis Pihakisof Pensacola, Fla., was convicted of fraud and has an extensivecriminal record. Pihakis has been coordinating arrangements withunidentified Greek businessmen planning to back Bakker's bid,Bakker attorney James Toms said.   Benton said he would meet with Bakker today.   ``I want to find out how he feels this will affect his deal ...(and hear) just what his alternatives are,'' Benton said.   Ryan Hovis, Bakker's attorney in Rock Hill, S.C., said Pihakisshould not become the issue in Bakker's bid.   ``There's no scam here. There's no payment to him. There'snothing we're risking'' on Pihakis, Hovis said.   Pihakis has ``never been the man with the money,'' Hovis said.   Asked whether Pihakis' criminal record casts doubt on thelegitimacy of the transaction, Toms said Wednesday, ``The only wayto tell is to see if the money is there.''   Earlier this week, Benton extended from Tuesday until today adeadline for Bakker to present a $3 million downpayment on hisoffer and set Friday as a deadline for contractual arrangements tobe worked out.   Bakker said Tuesday he needed only $100,000 more to reach the $3million, but Toms said Wednesday night he did not know whereBakker's total stood.   Benton faces a Saturday deadline to recommend a buyer for PTL'sassets to U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds. The assets includePTL's Christian theme park, satellite television network andundeveloped property near Fort Mill, S.C.   Also Wednesday, Canadian businessman Peter Thomas formallywithdrew his $113 million offer for the ministry's assets, butasked Benton to reopen the bidding.   Bakker resigned from PTL in March 1987, after admitting having asexual encounter with church secretary Jessica Hahn. PTL filed forprotection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code threemonths later.   WBTV said that from 1970 through 1981, Pihakis, who runsInternational Financial Consultants in Pensacola, was arrested orserved time for charges including fraud, mail fraud, conspiracy,forgery, counterfeiting and parole violations.   The station did not say where it got its information. The reportsaid Pihakis admitted to the station that he served eight months injail during that time on charges he said were trumped-up.   Pihakis' home telephone number is unlisted and he could not bereached for comment.   Toms told The Associated Press in a telephone invterviewWednesday night that neither Bakker nor his lawyers knew theidentity of the Greek businessmen.   He said they are relying on the word of longtime Bakker friendand Chicago businessman Jerry Sinclair, who led Bakker to Pihakisand has acted as a middleman between them. Toms described Pihakisas the U.S. representative for the Greek businessmen.   Sinclair, who declined to say what his business is but wasidentified by Toms as a songwriter, told the AP in a telephoneinterview from Fort Mill that he was aware that Pihakis had acriminal record, but he did not know how extensive it was.   Sinclair said he has had verification, which did not comethrough Pihakis, that the Greek financing is forthcoming.   As long as adverse publicity about Pihakis does not scare away aMidwest bank that has agreed to handle the Greek funds, the dealshould go through in a matter of days, Sinclair said.</TEXT></DOC>
