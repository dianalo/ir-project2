The government reported a trade surplus of 400 millionmarks ($228 million) for June, on the heels of a deficit of800 million marks in May. The swing ended two consecutivemonths of deficits and swelled Germany's trade surplus forthe first half to five billion marks. That compares with a64.8 billion-mark surplus for the first half of 1990,although the year-earlier figure reflected only West Germanforeign trade.</LP><TEXT>   The current account, a broader definition of Germany'spayments balance that includes merchandise trade, servicesand certain cash transfers, showed a deficit of 3.8 billionmarks in June after a revised 4.4 billion-mark deficit inMay.   For the first half, Germany showed a current accountdeficit of 20.1 billion marks, compared with a 49.4billion-mark surplus for just West Germany a year earlier.Contributing to the first half current account deficit wereBonn's multibillion-dollar payments to aid the U.S.-ledeffort in the Persian Gulf war.   Uniting the two German economies a year ago put greaterdemands on western German manufacturing capacity. Moreover,sluggish economies among Germany's leading trading partnersreduced markets for German goods, despite the competitiveGerman mark.   This reduced export flows and increased demand for importsas eastern Germans clamored for western products andequipment to rebuild their crippled industry. In the firstsix months of this year, for example, imports rose 15% whileexports slumped 5.3%, according to the government statisticsoffice.   In the past, policy makers defended Germany's trade andcurrent-account surpluses as crucial to maintaining a stablecurrency and low inflation. Yet the improved trade balancewas overshadowed by other inflationary threats to Germany'seconomic restructuring.   These include a sharp rise in deficit spending as easternGermany continues to survive chiefly on public subsidies forindustrial renewal and social programs.   An internal Finance Ministry memo disclosed Friday showedthat Germany's public-sector borrowing this year may total200.3 billion marks, including funding for the Germanrailway, postal service and the Treuhandanstalt agency, whichcontrols former East German companies.   The previously published estimate, which didn't includethe additional programs, was 156.4 billion marks in borrowingby federal, state and local authorities. This alone wouldequal 5.6% of Germany's gross national product, or totaloutput of goods and services.   The federal government has pledged to reduce deficitspending in coming years. But many fear that this will onlycome through more taxes, beginning with an increase inGermany's value-added tax on retail sales, rather thanpolitically sensitive cutbacks in subsidy programs.</TEXT></DOC>
