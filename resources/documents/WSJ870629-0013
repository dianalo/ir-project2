The 74-0 vote on Saturday was the Senate's first formal response to the violent anti-government protests in Korea.    The resolution, added to the omnibus trade bill before the body, doesn't carry the force of law or require President Reagan's signature. It was amended just before passage to attract support from conservative senators and the adminstration, according to an aide to Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D., Ariz.), the prime sponsor. The resolution said the conditions necessary for &quot;meaningful and free elections include freedom of expression, freedom of the press, respect for due process of law, an independent judiciary, the restoration of full political and civil rights and legal guarantees for the proper and humane treatment of all detainees.&quot;    According to the aide, the list originally included two other provisions: &quot;the recognition that torture has no place in a democratic society&quot; and &quot;the release of all political prisoners.&quot; The aide said these were deleted at the last minute to win administration and conservative backing. </TEXT></DOC>
