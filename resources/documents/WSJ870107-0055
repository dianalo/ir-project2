McGowan, had a heart attack two weeks ago, but the company didn't disclose the news until this week.    MCI executives said Mr. McGowan, 59 years old, will be sidelined for a month or so, recuperating at home.    Under federal securities laws, companies are required to disclose in a timely fashion &quot;material&quot; events deemed to be of interest to stockholders or to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Washington-based telecommunications concern said it withheld the news until this week partly to respect the wishes of Mr. McGowan and his wife. John R. Worthington, MCI's general counsel, said he also decided that Mr. McGowan's heart attack wasn't a &quot;material&quot; fact that would have to be disclosed to shareholders.    &quot;There was no reason for me to anticipate that this was anything but a temporary disability,&quot; he said.    Mr. McGowan is expected to be released today from Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, where he was taken by helicopter after suffering the heart attack Dec. 21 while vacationing in Virginia Beach, Va.    Though Mr. McGowan is viewed by many as the spiritual leader of MCI, analysts and company officials said they don't expect his absence to have much impact on the company. In recent years, Mr. McGowan has concentrated primarily on long-term strategic questions, leaving day-to-day operating decisions to other executives.    Bert C. Roberts Jr., the 44-year-old chief operating officer, &quot;has been running the company on a day-to-day basis anyway,&quot; an MCI spokesman said. Added Neil Yelsey, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc., &quot;McGowan has done a pretty good job of ensuring that there is more than one person providing leadership for the company.&quot;    But some analysts expressed surprise that MCI waited so long to confirm Mr. McGowan's illness, which was reported by the Washington Post yesterday. &quot;I would certainly consider it very material,&quot; said Charles Schelke of Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.    Richard M. Phillips, a securities lawyer in Washington, said a chairman's heart attack is &quot;not necessarily material,&quot; but he said the &quot;issue isn't clear.&quot; Although there are no specific reporting requirments concerning the health of executives, Mr. Phillips noted that &quot;it's something that hasn't been fully explored by the courts yet.&quot;    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, MCI closed at $6.375, down 12.5 cents.    Mr. McGowan's absence comes at a critical time for MCI. The company is trying to decide how much to cut long-distance telephone rates in response to an 11% price reduction instituted last week by American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. MCI also is restructuring its operations after laying off 15% of its employees last month in a cost-cutting move.    Mr. Roberts, the chief operating officer, said he has visited Mr. McGowan every other day at the hospital. He said the chairman is &quot;doing fine&quot; and is &quot;in good spirits.&quot; But Mr. Roberts said he wants the chairman &quot;to put his health as his No. 1 priority.&quot;    Associates say Mr. McGowan is now trying to break his longtime habit of chain-smoking cigarettes. </TEXT></DOC>
