Chief Contra negotiator Enrique Bermudez, just before headinginto the second day of talks today, said he had reason to ``doubtthe sincerity'' of the Sandinista offer of a truce and amnesty.   Bermudez said the Sandinistas did not offer a true amnesty butmerely offered to release political prisoners from jail, stoppingshort of restoring their civil and political rights.   Talks between the U.S.-backed Contra rebels and the Sandinistagovernment opened Thursday. Nicaragua's foreign minister saidbefore the talks that if the rebels agreed to demobilize, hisgovernment would meet their demands for a truce and amnesty.   The Contras countered with a plan to restore the cease-fire withthe government, which was called off last week, and discuss otherconditions _ such as demobilization _ later.   Neither proposal was accepted, despite the urging of U.N.Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to renew the cease-firethat President Daniel Ortega ended.   An estimated 12,000 people have been killed in the 8-year-oldwar.   Perez de Cuellar and his Organization of American Statescounterpart, Joao Clemente Baena Soares, turned the mediationeffort over to aides.   An election campaign is under way in Nicaragua under a regionalpeace accord signed in August. The plan calls for free and fairelections.   Voting is set for Feb. 25, and U.N. observers say the campaignis proceeding smoothly.   Foreign Minister Miguel d'Escoto of Nicaragua said before themeeting that key Contra demands would be met if demobilizationbegan by the end of November.   Documents obtained by The Associated Press showed the Contras'opening position calling for an immediate truce. The Sandinistaswould then declare a amnesty for the rebels by Nov. 20.   The estimated 12,000 Contras camped in Honduras would then moveinto Nicaragua, with their weapons, to join their comrades there insecure zones.   Diplomats said this would remove the pressure placed on Hondurasunder the Central American peace plan to shut down the Contra campsby Dec. 5.   Only after these steps had been completed would discussion ofdisbanding the Contras begin, under the rebel proposal.   Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco, who leadsNicaragua's delegation to the U.N. meeting, rejected the Contraproposal as presented.   D'Escoto, waving a copy of Sandinista proposals, said theContras say ``they require three things; the three things are metby what we are offering.''   D'Escoto said the Nicaraguan delegation was willing to stay inNew York beyond the two days allotted for the talks and would beflexible. ``This is a proposal, not an ultimatum,'' he said of theSandinista document.   In Miami, the Contras announced formation of a new``civilian-military commission'' to replace the old directorate,several of whose members have resigned and returned to Nicaragua.   Contra military spokesman Alejandro Acevedo said the U.N.negotiating team led by Contra military commander Enrique Bermudezhad recognized the new commission, which includes only one of theformer directors, Aristides Sanchez.   Ousted civilian Contra leaders compared the action to a coup.   When Bermudez arrived for the U.N. meeting, he said: ``We expectto re-establish the cease-fire and put an end to the totalitariangovernment in Nicaragua.''   In refusing to renew the cease-fire after 19 weeks, Ortega citedincreased Contra attacks in Nicaragua. Contra leaders denied therebels were attacking, which is forbidden by Congress while theystill receive U.S. aid.   Congress ended U.S. military aid to the Contras in 1988, but hascontinued non-lethal aid.   Honduras, where most of the 12,000 Contras are encamped, andCardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo of Managua are attending the peacetalks as observers.   The last direct talks between the Sandinistas and Contras brokedown in June 1988. They agreed to a 90-day cease-fire during thatsession, in March, and Nicaragua had extended it on a monthlybasis, with tacit agreement from the Contras.</TEXT></DOC>
