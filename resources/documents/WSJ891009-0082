Last Wednesday, she started a 10-day protest fast.    Sitting on a blue mattress on the floor of East Berlin's Gethsemane church, wrapped in a blanket, she explains why.    &quot;Changes are taking place in many socialist countries, but in East Germany everything has stayed the same,&quot; she says with disgust. &quot;We need changes here, too, and fast.&quot;    In recent weeks, world attention has focused on the tens of thousands of disgruntled East Germans who have fled to the West. At the same time, a development that is just as dramatic, albeit less visible, has been shaking this hard-line Communist state: the extraordinary rise of a mass protest movement for reform.    Ms. Kunze and the half-dozen people who have joined her hunger strike at Gethsemane, a Protestant church, are but one manifestation of the new mood of defiance. Last month, the nation's Protestant Church, shaking off its lingering inhibitions, went public with a call for sweeping political changes. About 1,000 East German musicians and artists have signed a resolution condemning the &quot;unbearable ignorance of the state and party leadership.&quot;    And this anniversary weekend, thousands of demonstrators defied authorities by taking to the streets of several cities. In Berlin, protesters marched for more than six hours around the town center chanting &quot;Freedom, freedom.&quot;    East German uniformed and plain-clothes police, who at first seemed at a loss as to how to deal with the protest, eventually used truncheons and water cannon to break it up and arrested several hundred demonstrators. The emergence of a fledgling organized opposition to the Communist leadership is also bolstering the new-found activism. In recent weeks, at least six new political groupings have sprung up across the country seemingly from nowhere, presenting a major challenge to the regime of Erich Honecker, the nation's ailing 77-year-old leader. Tens of thousands of the 16 million East Germans are flocking to public meetings of these groups, often in churches to avoid confrontation with security forces on the streets.    The birth of this new movement -- which is officially outlawed -- is due in part to the recent mass exodus of almost 50,000 East Germans. Many who have long harbored hopes for a less rigid and repressive system say the government's tough handling of the refugee crisis was the final straw. Others cite heavy-handed manipulation of the results of local elections last May, which has been extensively documented by activists who made independent checks.    But the new activism also attests to the spirit of change now sweeping the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. East German reformists, like their counterparts in Hungary, Poland and several Soviet republics, are plucking up the courage to air their long-standing grievances in public and to press for greater freedoms.    They are united by a belief that the system of authoritarian socialism established by Joseph Stalin in Eastern Europe four decades ago is bankrupt and on the verge of collapse. Most of the East German activists, far from being supporters of capitalism, say they want to create a new and more democratic socialist state, one in which the press can tell the truth and citizens have guaranteed rights and can genuinely participate in government.    Their road ahead is likely to be long and extremely rocky. East Berlin has rejected out of hand all their demands as &quot;anti-socialist.&quot; Pinned to the walls of Gethsemane church are lists of dozens of names of people jailed in recent weeks in Berlin, Leipzig, Dresden and elsewhere for taking part in illegal demonstrations or signing petitions.    But the activists themselves say that whatever the short-term measures taken against them, reform of some sort is inevitable in East Germany. &quot;Socialism must change or die,&quot; says Rainer Eppelmann, a Berlin pastor who heads one of the new political groups, Democratic Awakening. The country must treat its citizens with more respect if it is to keep its position as the most affluent in Eastern Europe, he says. To Mr. Honecker's chagrin, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev probably agrees with such assessments. Visiting East Berlin over the weekend, Mr. Gorbachev for the most part supported his &quot;longtime friend,&quot; Mr. Honecker. But Mr. Gorbachev also dropped clear hints that he favored some liberalization here, too.    Asked by Western reporters whether the situation in East Germany was perilous, he replied: &quot;The danger is for those who don't react to life. Those who take impulses from life and society and base their policies on them don't need to be afraid.&quot;    Attendance at a public discussion of the new reform movement shows just how far the East German leadership is out of touch with life in its society -- and thus has every reason to be afraid. The meeting, one of the biggest so far, was held in Berlin's Church of the Redeemer last Friday, only hours after a pompous official ceremony in the Palace of the Republic to mark the state's 40th anniversary.    About 1,500 people, most of them under 40, crammed the pews, aisles and balconies of the church to debate the future of East Germany -- a topic barely raised during the ceremony at the Palace of the Republic. The Protestant church was so full that latecomers had to stand outside, trying to overhear the debate through open windows.    It started with representatives from the new political groupings outlining ideas for reform and reading aloud a joint declaration demanding &quot;democratic restructuring.&quot; Rolf Henrich, an activist of &quot;New Forum,&quot; one of the groups, told how he was thrown out of the Communist Party and lost his job as a lawyer more than a decade ago because, disgusted with the system, he was writing a critical book.    The new groups are only now starting to work out their strategies. But the question of what sort of tactics they should adopt is already a hot topic for debate. Fearing a repeat of the crackdown against reformists in China, many urge extreme caution.    &quot;We must remember that there was a man named Gandhi who proved you can break a stone with gentle water,&quot; said one participant, deploring an incident in Dresden last week when protesters threw paving stones through windows. &quot;But Gandhi organized demonstrations, and we must do the same,&quot; shouted another. &quot;We need to let off steam,&quot; agreed a third.    Fear of reprisals no longer seems to scare away potential protesters as much as it did in the past. For many, the big turnout at the Redeemer Church meeting, and numerous ones like it around the country, is reassuring.    &quot;That sort of {Redeemer Church} meeting is still quite exotic,&quot; Mr. Eppelmann acknowledged the next morning, saying that the opposition must do more to organize itself. He is convinced that the reformers will eventually win out. While change from the top remains unlikely with Mr. Honecker in charge, Mr. Eppelmann hopes that Mr. Honecker's successors in the Communist Party will sooner or later realize there isn't any alternative.
