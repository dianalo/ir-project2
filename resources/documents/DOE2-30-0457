The beta alumina solid electrolyte (SE) contactshigh temperature(900-1300K) sodium and low temperature(400-800K) sodium.When heated liquid sodium is delivered to the high temperature side bya pump, ion is transfered by the driving force generated from differencebetween high and low vapour pressure, generating the electric power.The ion is neutralized and evaporated in the electrode film and condensedin the low temperature side. It is important to reduce the inner electricresistance to improve the volt-ampere characteristic and it is especiallyimportant to develop better SE and porous electrode film. The heat lossequal to or less than 0.5W/cm{sup 2} is required to make this efficiencyhigher. Ford Motor achieved the result of 0.5W/cm{sup 2} output and 1,600hrduration under the research contract with DOE. The maximum efficiencyof 19% is now established. (7 figs, 11 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
