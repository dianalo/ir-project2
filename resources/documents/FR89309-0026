Willis, FAR Secretariat,Room 4041, GS Building, Washington, DC 20405, (202) 523-4755.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2><ITAG tagnum="84"> A. Background</ITAG>The proposed rule will add submission of final, indirect cost-rate proposalsas an example of a situation when the authority to require certificationin accordance with the Truth in Negotiations Act should be exercised. Thisexample was not incorporated into the Federal Acquisition Regulation becauseit was thought to be redundant. However, to eliminate questions that havearisen because of elimination of the example and to acknowledge that itis now and always has been authorized, it is now being specifically emphasized.A review of the coverage of final, indirect rate settlements at FAR 42.705indentified ambiguities with regard to the need for contractor certificationof data.Proposed coverage revises FAR 15.804-4(i) to clarify that certificationof final indirect rate proposals is required. Revised coverage is alsoproposed to FAR 42.705-1 and -2 to reference 15.804-4. The clause at 52.216-13has been amended to make it consistent with a similar clause at 52.216-7.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq., because most contracts awardedas a result of negotiations are awarded to large businesses. Furthermore,the proposed revisions merely illustrate the nature of records Governmentauditors have access to and do not change existing requirements. An initialregulatory flexibility analysis has therefore not been performed. Commentsare invited from small businesses and other interested parties. Commentsfrom small entities concerning the affected FAR Subpart will also be consideredin accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submittedseparately and cite FAR Case 88-610 in correspondence.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The Paperwork Reduction Act (Pub. L. 96-511) does not apply because theproposed rule changes no recordkeeping or information collection requirementsor collection of information from offerors, contractors, or members ofthe public which require the approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 15, 42, and 52</ITAG>Government procurement.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: February 27, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Harry S.
