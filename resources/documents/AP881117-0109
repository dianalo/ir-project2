The flag-waving procession swept aside a cordon of about 20 riotpolice on the outskirts of the capital, Pristina, and ignored pleasby local Communist officials to return to Titova Mitrovica, 30 milesaway.   Kacusa Jasari, the president of Kosovo's Communist Party,announced her resignation during a meeting to discuss personnelchanges in the provincial leadership, the state-run Tanjug newsagency said. It must be approved by the party presidium.   Jasari said Azem Vlasi will no longer be a member of Kosovo'spresidium because of a recent federal decision that prohibitsCentral Committee members from membership in local party bodies,Tanjug said.   Vlasi, the former provincial party president, is a member of thenational party's Central Committee.   The two Albanian leaders have been the main target of resignationdemands by Serbia's communist party chief, Slobodan Milosevic, inhis drive to bring Kosovo under tighter Serbian control.   Although administratively part of Serbia, Kosovo enjoys wideautonomy under the constitution adopted under the late Josip BrozTito. Serbs claim they are harassed by the Albanian majority.   The marching miners carried pictures of Tito. The protest,involving about 4,000, was believed to be the largest by ethnicAlbanians since ethnic riots in 1981 left at least nine people deadin Pristina.   The Pristina meeting, described as crucial by the Belgrade press,was convened after severe criticism of Kosovo's mostly ethnicAlbanian leadership by Serbs.   ``Despite having shown considerable initiative in her duties, shehas to bear objective responsibility for the situation'' in Kosovo,said a statement by Kosovo's leadership, carried by Tanjug.   Jasari replaced Vlasi as head of the provincial Communist Partylast year.   Seven Kosovo leaders have stepped down in the past month.   Milosevic, backed by mass rallies attended by hundreds ofthousands of Serbs in recent months, has blamed Kosovo's leadershipfor ethnic tensions in the province.   Jasari said in her opening speech that the provincial leadership``had to insist with greater determination on preventing'' bothAlbanian and Serbian nationalism in Kosovo, Tanjug reported.   The demands for the replacement of the provincial leadership arebased on claims they have been unable to cope with Albaniannationalism that has allegedly been simmering since 1981.</TEXT></DOC>
