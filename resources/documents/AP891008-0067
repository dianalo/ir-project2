A number of people were injured and at least 30 people weredetained in the police actions Sunday in East Berlin, witnessessaid. No official reports were given.   Paramilitary troops and police with attack dogs forceddemonstrators into sidestreets as the protesters shouted ``We wantfreedom!'' and ``No violence!'' Residents held candles out theirwindows in support of the demonstrators.   It was the second day of violence between police andanti-government demonstrators.   Hundreds of people were arrested during demonstrations in thecapital and five other major cities Saturday, which marked thecommunist country's 40th anniversary.   About 5,000 people had been in or near Gethsemane Church duringa pro-democracy vigil and an estimated 2,000 people staged a sit-inon the nearby Schoenhauser Allee after authorities blocked themfrom joining the church vigil, witnesses said.   Thousands of the activists left the church area after successfulnegotiations between church officials and police to begin lettingthe demonstrators through police lines, witnesses said. Many thenjoined the protesters on the Schoenhauser Allee.   However, police moved in to drive demonstrators into sidestreetsseveral times, beating many of them with truncheons and clubs andusing trucks with steel-mesh barriers in front, witnesses said.   Many apartment dwellers lighted candles in their windows and onbalconies to show solidarity with the demonstrators.   A middle-age man who watched the action from his apartmentwindow said: ``It's getting worse and worse. Someday soon, rocksand Molotov cocktails are going to fly.''   East Germany accused the Western news media of encouragingSaturday's protests. It refused to renew the visas of dozens ofWestern journalists who were in East Berlin for the two-day visitof Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev that ended Saturday. Thereporters were told to leave the city when their visas expired atmidnight Sunday.   Hundreds of injuries were reported as police swinging truncheonsrepeatedly charged demonstrators in East Berlin on Saturday andearly Sunday. Police punched, kicked, beat and dragged theprotesters away, and roughed up Western journalists covering thedemonstrations.   At least one Western reporter, Sunday Times of Londoncorrespondent Peter Millar, was detained for six hours.   The East German protests were the largest since a workers'uprising was put down by Soviet forces in 1953.   Gorbachev's reform policies have made him popular among manyEast Germans and protesters chanted his name and called for hissupport.   Despite the growing unrest and the exodus of thousands of EastGermans to the West, East German leader Erich Honecker said duringtalks with Gorbachev Saturday that he would stick to his hard-linecourse.   Also Sunday, a group of pro-democracy activists announced theyhad formed a Social Democratic Party. The party's charter wassigned by 43 people in Schwante, near Berlin.   The group's charter calls for a ``rigorous democratization ofstate and society'' and says the party wants to ``work with alldemocratic initiatives, groups and people in our land.'' Leaders ofthe group indicated they would not immediately apply for the partyto be legalized.   A prominent reform group, Neues Forum or New Forum, was recentlybanned by the communist government. New Forum says it has grownfrom its original 30 members to more than 11,000.   An estimated 15,000 people joined in pro-reform demonstationsover the weekend in East Berlin, Leipzig, Dresden, Potsdam, Jenaand Plauen, according to West German television and witnessaccounts.   The Hessischer Rundfunk radio station in Frankfurt, WestGermany, said 700 protesters had been arrested in East Berlinalone, although witnesses said the number could be more than 1,000.   Lutheran church leaders called for the release of the detaineesand appealed for calm.   ARD, a West German television network, showed television footageof helmeted East German police in riot gear charging demonstratorsin the historic city of Leipzig, hitting them with truncheons evenafter the protest had been broken up.   In East Berlin the official East German news agency called theprotesters ``troublemakers.''   There were strong indications of support even from those who didnot take to the streets.   Apartment dwellers rushed to their balconies to urge onthousands of protesters with sparklers, cheers and applause. In acrowded, smoke-filled bar, a young East Berliner shouted ``HappyBirthday police state.''   For three hours early Sunday, AP-Dow Jones reporter IgorReichlin hid in the apartment of an East German family after he waschased by police when trying to cover the protests. The familyrisked prison sentences by refusing to open the door to the police.   For the fourth straight day Sunday, East Germany barred Westerntourists from entering East Berlin. Tourists were turned away afterbeing told ``it is not possible today'' with no further explanation.   The exodus of tens of thousands of East Germans via Hungary,Czechoslovakia and Poland deeply embarrassed East Berlin'sleadership during the weekend anniversary celebrations.   More than 48,000 East Germans have fled to West Germany sinceSept. 11, when Hungary defied its Warsaw Pact ally and opened itswestern border. From early Saturday until early Sunday, 941 EastGermans reached West Germany, all via Hungary, West Germanofficials said.</TEXT></DOC>
