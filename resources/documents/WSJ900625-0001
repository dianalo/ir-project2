So it has come as a surprise for the Hong Kong StockExchange to learn from a survey that the colony'sstock-owning public numbers only about 363,000 people, or 9%of the adult population. &quot;The figure is disappointingly low.It's a shock,&quot; said Francis Yuen, the exchange's chiefexecutive officer.</LP><TEXT>   Commissioned by the exchange and conducted late last year,the survey points to a big gap in efforts to repair the localstock market's dented image. Such efforts have been under waysince the 1987 Black Monday crash exposed serious managementflaws in Hong Kong's market. They took on added urgency afterlast year's brutal suppression on June 4 of pro-democracyprotests in Beijing. In addition to exacerbating publicconcern over this British colony's 1997 return to Chineserule, that event helped underscore local stocks'vulnerability to political turmoil in China.   The consequent market reforms and promotion campaignsundertaken by the government and the exchange have been aimedmainly at allaying concerns of foreign investors. Little,though, has been done to woo the local public. One result, asthe survey indicates, is dwindling participation by Hong Konginvestors.   Professing alarm at the phenomenon, the stock exchange ismoving to win back its home market. Its campaign, announcedThursday in conjunction with release of the survey, consistsof a five-week promotional exhibition. Moving from site tosite in mostly middle-income neighborhoods, the exchange'sdisplay is designed to remind the public that Hong Kong has astock market and that people should consider putting money init.   &quot;Too much has been done since 1987 to promote the stockmarket to foreign investors,&quot; Mr. Yuen said. &quot;It's theindividuals we need to do more for.&quot;   By his estimate, trading activity used to be splitrelatively evenly among three camps -- rich localindividuals, small local investors and institutions, most ofthem based overseas. With data only on those localindividuals, rich and otherwise, who owned stock as of late1989, the survey doesn't show how the overall trading patternhas changed over the years. Mr. Yuen argued nevertheless thatthe role of small-time local investors has diminishednoticeably since the 1987 crash.   Investment interest generally has picked up over the pastcouple of months as the market slowly regains ground. As aresult, the value of shares traded each session on manyrecent days has exceeded HK$2 billion (US$256.8 million),double the daily average during the first quarter of 1990.Much of the increase is attributed to Taiwan investorsswitching out of their ailing market. But Mr. Yuen said HongKong can't count on such a boon to last and must try harderto rebuild investor confidence at home.   He cited comparable surveys that put stock-ownershiplevels in the U.S. and Canada at around 16% of the adultpopulation, saying Hong Kong should do at least as well. Butjudging by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange's survey, much morethan the five-week promotion may be needed to address whatmay be a lack of confidence by the colony's potentialinvestors.   &quot;Some of it may be just the result of misconceptions aboutthe market,&quot; Mr. Yuen said. &quot;But it will take a long time tocorrect.&quot;   Hong Kong's survey, conducted from September to December,bases its conclusions on 2,000 randomly selected adults. Forthe survey's purposes, the term stock owners refers only tothose who invest directly in stocks and not those who do soonly indirectly, such as through unit trusts. Among those2,000, 307 owners and 301 non-owners were picked for in-depthinterviews.   Among the respondents who previously owned stock but nolonger did so at the time of the survey, the most oft-citedreason for not investing is that they have had an &quot;unpleasantexperience&quot; in the market. Though not specified in thesurvey, such experiences, according to Mr. Yuen, stem mainlyfrom losses suffered in the 1987 crash or during last year'sJune 4 political crisis.   As for stock owners, the survey undermines to some extentthe often-cited stereotype of them as greedy, ill-informedspeculators willing to take illogical risks.   White-collar workers, at 29.2%, form a core of thestock-owning population. Professionals and businessmen followwith 28.1%. Next come blue-collar workers at 21.7%,housewives at 12.5%, the retired at 7.3% and, finally,students and the unemployed at 1.2%.   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          Tokyo stocks ended lower in thin trading Friday asparticipants took conservative positions ahead of theweekend, while the yen's softness discouraged buying, traderssaid.   London shares were moderately higher.   The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues was down 392.70points at 31694.57. The index slipped 0.49 point Thursday.   In early trading in Tokyo Monday, the Nikkei index gave upanother 339.09 points to 31355.48.   Friday's volume on the First Section was estimated at 350million shares, down from 409 million Thursday.   Losing issues outnumbered winning issues, 703 to 227,while 189 were unchanged.   The Tokyo Stock Price Index (Topix) of all issues listedin the first section, which fell 5.24 points Thursday, sank20.50 points, or 0.87%, to 2341.06.   The second section index, which rose 4.15 points Thursday,fell 16.31 points, or 0.39%, to close at 4135.42. Volume inthe second section was estimated at 20 million shares, downfrom 24.5 million Thursday.   Growing concern that Japan may not be able to avoidinflation in the coming months is suppressing buyingactivity, although volume indicates that the bearishnesshasn't gotten out of hand, observers said.   Issues hit by moderate profit-taking and generalbearishness Friday included Canon Sales, down 140 yen (91cents) to 4,880 yen, Chubu Electric, down 100 to 3,300,Fujisawa Pharmaceutical, down 30 to 2,020, and DainipponPharmaceutical, off 30 to 3,160.

London share prices finished moderately higher asinvestors chose to sit out the session before the opening ofthis week's new trading account and expiration of Junestock-index futures and options contracts.   Dealers said there were too many corporate and economicuncertainties lurking in the background for institutionalinvestors to get more deeply involved in the market.Moreover, ongoing major U.K. sporting events, combined withan unimpressive start on Wall Street, set the market adriftfor most of the session.   The broad-based Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-shareindex closed up 8.2 points at 2378.5, down from the intradaypeak of 2381.1 just after the release of British tradefigures. The day's low of 2368.2, reached after one hour ofofficial trading, was down 2.1 on the day.   At the final tally, the narrower FT 30-share index was up5.2 points at 1913.5. Volume registered a moderate 497.8million shares compared with the 415.4 million tradedThursday.   In the futures market, the June FT-SE 100 index contractclosed at 2390.0, up from its close of 2389.0 Thursday.   Midmorning trade figures, which were slightly better thanmarket expectations, had only a temporary impact on anotherwise sluggish market. There was little incentive toshift existing positions before the forthcoming close of thesecond quarter, market professionals added.   May's current account deficit stood at #1.32 billion($2.27 billion), down from #1.60 billion in April andcompared with estimates of #1.35 billion.   Amid a session of sparse corporate developments, shares inpharmaceutical company Wellcome were the biggest gainers onthe day. Dealers said the move came in the wake of a heftysell-off earlier in the week on bearish forecasts for thecompany's Retrovir drug used to combat the effects of the HIVvirus. Dealers contended the drop was overdone and Wellcomegained 25 pence (43 cents) to 625 pence on volume of 1.6million shares.   Stocks closed higher in Paris, Frankfurt, Zurich,Amsterdam and Madrid and lower in Milan. Stockholm was closedfor a holiday. South African gold stocks closed mixed.   Share prices closed lower in Taipei and Wellington, weremixed in Hong Kong and Singapore and higher in Sydney, Seouland Manila.
