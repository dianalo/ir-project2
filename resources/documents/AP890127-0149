(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man who helped develop New Mexico'sonly heart transplant program died Friday after his own heart wasstricken suddenly by a viral infection and a donor organ could notbe found, officials said.   Robert Shafer, 46, assistant administrator for medical staffaffairs at Presbyterian Hospital, suffered the attack last week, andhis condition rapidly deteriorated.   ``The feeling of helplessness has gripped us all,'' said hospitalspokeswoman Lynn Villella. ``The donor program has done everythinghumanly possible.''   Shafer left work Jan. 19 with flu-like symptoms and was admittedto the hospital Monday. He was put on a list of transplantcandidates Tuesday and placed on a heart-lung machine Wednesdayafter his heart failed.   On Friday morning, his family requested he be taken off themachine after all his organs began to deteriorate, she said.   Shafer, an administrator at the hospital for 20 years, oversawits heart program when it began in 1969 and helped direct itsdevelopment since then, Ms. Villella said.   The program began transplants in 1986 and since then has done 32,plus one heart-lung transplant.   Gov. Garrey Carruthers had issued an appeal for a donor, as didShafer's wife, Joyce, who pledged to work to increase publicawareness of the need for donor organs. ``This should never happento anyone else,'' she said in a statement.   Many viruses can either attack the heart directly or cause thebody's immune system to damage the heart, said Dr. Ronnie Garner, aPresbyterian pathologist.   Shafer's case was particularly unusual because of the quickprogression to complete heart failure, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
