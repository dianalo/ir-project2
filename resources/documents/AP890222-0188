The cloistered committee of guerrilla field commanders andscholars was handed the job of proposing a provisional governmentafter rebel leaders paralyzed by differences failed to make anyheadway, rebel sources said.   At the United Nations, meanwhile, the Afghan government againaccused Pakistan and the United States of supporting Afghan rebelraids and asked for U.N. help.   ``Nobody knows where they (committee members) are. Not even theleaders,'' said Wahab, a spokesman for the Yunis Khalis faction ofHezb-e-Islami rebel group. ``They have no one with them, not evenguards.''   The committee's recommendation will be put to a vote by more than400 delegates attending the special Afghan council, or ``shura.''Delays and suspensions have marked the shura since it convened Feb.10.   Days of acrimonious debate among the top political leaders of theseven major guerrilla parties based in Pakistan failed to come upwith a consensus on an interim government.   ``It stagnated,'' a rebel spokesman said on condition ofanonymity. Delegates to the council have become ``very fed up withtoo many delays and too much fuss.''   Shiite Afghan guerrillas based in Iran, where about 2 millionAfghan war refugees live, have boycotted the shura, alleging unfairrepresentation.   The Pakistani-based fighters belong to the Sunni sect of Islam,as do most of Afghanistan's 15 million people.   The Pakistan-based Afghan fighters, who are supported by theUnited States, are loosely divided into Islamic moderates andfundamentalists.   The political maneuvering by Afghan guerrillas, called mujahedeenor Islamic warriors, assumes the ruling communists in Kabul will betoppled now that Moscow has ended its military intervention there.   The guerrillas are fighting to establish an Islamic republic inAfghanistan, and they have predicted the government will fall withinmonths or even weeks.   The last Soviet soldier left Afghanistan on Feb. 15, ending nineyears of Soviet military involvement in the civil war. More than100,000 Red Army troops were in Afghanistan at the height of Sovietinvolvement.   The Afghan government has claimed Pakistan and the United Stateshave continued to aid the rebels and have violated terms of theU.N.-brokered agreement that resulted in the withdrawal of Soviettroops.   In New York, Afghan Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil said in a letterto Security Council president Jai Pratap Rana of Nepal that ``theterritory of Pakistan is used for the purpose of training,equipping, financing, and recruitment of mercenaries.   ``Even today there are 120 training camps of armed extremistgroups in Pakistan,'' said Wakil, adding that the U.N. Good OfficesMission to Afghanistan and Pakistan had been informed of the problem38 times.   In the nine months since the signing of the withdrawal accord, hesaid, the rebels have launched 557 armed attacks ``mostly oncivilian targets,'' 403 bomb explosions, and fired 201,000 rocketsand missiles on cities, killing hundreds of people and injuring over12,200, said Wakil.   Afghanistan has asked Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellarto deploy U.N. peacekeeping troops to prevent cross-border raids andcut supply lines.</TEXT></DOC>
