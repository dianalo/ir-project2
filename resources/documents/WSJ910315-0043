The pact is also likely to become a political issue forthe Teamsters, which is facing its first direct election oftop officers to be held under government monitoring. Theagreement was negotiated by a team headed by R.V. Durham, aunion vice president from North Carolina who has the blessingof the current president, William McCarthy. Mr. McCarthyisn't running for re-election.</LP><TEXT>   The negotiators, meeting in Chicago, agreed on wageincreases of about 3% a year, involving boosts of 50 cents anhour the first year of the contract and 45 cents an hour inthe second and third years. Part of the 45-cent raises wouldhinge on increases in the cost of living.   This is slimmer than the wage package the Teamstersreached last summer with United Parcel Service of AmericaInc. That contract was expected to set a precedent for thetrucking pact and other Teamsters negotiations.   The truckers' wage and benefit package adds up to anestimated $2.45 an hour over three years, compared with about$2.73 an hour for the UPS pact. That kind of comparison isexpected to be one issue for Teamsters members.   The Teamsters leaders, in fact, had recommendedrank-and-file rejection of the UPS contract as inadequate,even as they submitted it for ratification last year. It wasratified, however.   They'll present the trucking agreement, which covers160,000 of the union's 1.4 million members, to local leadersat a meeting in Chicago next Tuesday. Ballots will be mailedout for ratification late this month, and trucking memberswill have until late April to vote. Meanwhile, the oldcontract, which was to expire midnight March 31, will beextended to allow for ratification.   This time, only a simple majority vote against the pact isneeded to reject it and authorize a strike. In 1988, beforethe union changed its bylaws, 64% of the vote went againstthe trucking agreement, but it was ratified because atwo-thirds &quot;no&quot; vote was needed.   But the new agreement seems certain to come in for sharpcriticism, especially by challengers to Mr. Durham forpresident, and Weldon Mathis, who is seeking re-election assecretary-treasurer.   Ronald Carey, who is head of a big New York UPS Teamsterslocal and is backed by the dissident Teamsters for aDemocratic Union, is also running for president. So too, isWalter Shea, a Teamsters vice president and longtimeexecutive assistant to the union's president, who was firedfrom that job by Mr. McCarthy when Mr. Shea declared for thepresidency. Mr. Shea's running mate, bidding for thesecretary-treasurer job, is Daniel Ligurotis, a vicepresident from Chicago.   Major U.S. truckers, including Consolidated FreightwaysInc., Menlo Park, Calif., and Roadway Services Inc., Akron,Ohio, declined to comment on the tentative agreement. Butsuch &quot;less-than-truckload&quot; carriers, which carry severalshipments in a trailer, are expected to go ahead withfreight-rate increases next month to cover higher labor andother costs.   In anticipation of the Teamsters agreement, severaltruck-rate bureaus, which set rates collectively for theindustry, announced plans to raise rates between 5.5% and 6%on April 1. The carriers raised rates 4% last June, but someof that increase has been gradually eroded by pricediscounting as freight volumes slackened. General increasesdon't necessarily raise prices for all shippers, becauseabout 70% of carrier revenues today are derived throughcontract rates negotiated individually with shippers.   Shippers said they were heartened that the agreement wasreached two weeks before the March 31 deadline. &quot;The newaccord seems to be reasonable and should enhance theproductivity of the trucking industry,&quot; said Joseph F.H.Cutrona, executive director of the National Small ShipmentsTraffic Conference, a Washington-based group representingsome 300 less-than-truckload shippers.</TEXT></DOC>
