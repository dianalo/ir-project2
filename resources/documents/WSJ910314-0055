The panel passed the measure 15-7 with Democrats votingfor it and Republicans opposing it. The bill is given a goodchance of passage in the House but faces a tougher fight inthe Senate. In addition, the administration has threatened aveto.</LP><TEXT>   Unions contend that employers often threaten to replaceworkers permanently if they strike, damping union efforts toorganize workers and to negotiate contracts effectively. Foryears, employers rarely took advantage of a 1938 SupremeCourt decision that affirmed their right to replace strikerspermanently, but more have been doing so lately, such as inthe Eastern Airlines and New York Daily News strikes.Employers are fighting the bill.   The measure would prohibit employers from hiring permanentreplacements for striking workers, though they could hiretemporary replacements while a strike is in progress and usethem later to fill vacancies. It would also bar employersfrom giving job preference, over strikers, to workers whodon't walk out or who cross picket lines and return to workduring a strike.   Opponents have said the bill's language suggests that evenif nonunion workers leave their jobs, say, to protestgrievances, they couldn't be permanently replaced. But Rep.Pat Williams (D., Mont.), the subcommittee chairman, andother proponents have repeatedly insisted that the measureapplies only to strikes by unionized workers.</TEXT></DOC>
