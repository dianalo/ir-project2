A little girl in cheerleader attire puts itall together and yells out: &quot;The First Amendment means youcan have any religion you want.&quot; The teacher beams.   To grade-school teachers and others, instructing aboutreligion in public schools is the wave of the future -- andan approach cultivating compassion between peoples. &quot;Theoutcome will be a more peaceful society,&quot; Ms. Stafford says.   As educators throughout the country launch efforts toresurrect teaching about religion, however, unholy wars havebroken out among parents, religious groups and school boards.Some critics contend the movement inevitably favors America'spredominant faith, Christianity, and worry such teachingmight be used to proselytize. Others wonder about which ofthe world's 3,000 religions will be included -- only five areto be taught in California's new program -- and how their ownparticular faiths are to be described.   Meanwhile, parents have been challenging whether childrenthey have raised to believe in one God should be exposed tothe smorgasbord of deities worshiped around the world. A fewyears ago, a comparative exercise similar to Ms. Stafford'scaused a furor among fundamentalist parents in Texas, whoeventually failed to persuade schools to stop equatingChristianity with other religions.   &quot;This is fraught with practical, constitutional andintellectual perils,&quot; says Barry W. Lynn, legislative counselfor the American Civil Liberties Union. &quot;It isn't a violationto emphasize one political system over another, or capitalismover Marxism&quot; in a classroom, he says. &quot;But promoting oremphasizing one religion over others or none can be aconstitutional violation.&quot;   God, lately a taboo topic in public schools, nonethelessseems to be making a comeback in this comparative form.Recently, five states offered pilot programs with areligious-liberty curriculum issued by First LibertyInstitute, a coalition of educators and religious groupsformed in 1988 and partly funded by insurance giant Mutual ofAmerica Life. This month, Georgia will begin trainingteachers statewide in how to use the curriculum from theinstitute, which is based at George Mason University inFairfax, Va.   Two months ago, California adopted statewide textbooks forkindergarten through eighth grade that teach aboutChristianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism. BecauseCalifornia texts often are adopted by other states --Arkansas, Indiana, Oregon and West Virginia have alreadyadopted the new books -- religion education seems destinedfor much of the nation's 16,000 other school districts.   The California classroom experience illustrates how thecontroversy can be carried home. &quot;How do you know whatreligion you want to be?&quot; one soul-searching seventh graderasked Clovis teacher Peggy Ulrich, who says she has alreadytackled many tough questions. &quot;How can people kill each otherover religion? How do you have a war that is holy?&quot; a seventhgrader recently asked Clovis teacher Roberta Wells in adiscussion about the Muslim Jihad holy war.   Class discussions can be highly charged. In aneighth-grade class taught by Fresno history teacher CarolRoberson, a Christian girl berated a Muslim boy for beliefsshe felt ran counter to the Bible. &quot;He's wrong, and he'sgoing to hell,&quot; the girl chastised. Ms. Roberson, who herselfwas raised a born-again charismatic Christian, told the classthat the two have different philosophies, neither &quot;correct.&quot;Other children comforted the Muslim, saying they didn't thinkhe was hellbound.   Similarly, when teacher Gerald Anderson asked his Fresnohigh schoolers why Jews have been persecuted, an exchangeerupted between Christian students believing that the Jewskilled Jesus, and the class's lone Jewish boy, who arguedthat it was the Romans. The next day, seeking to set thingsstraight, Mr. Anderson explained that only the Roman role isclear historically, and that the issue of Jewish complicityis outlined mainly in New Testament texts written many yearslater.   For most teachers, heading into such turbulent waters issomething quite new. After the Supreme Court bannedpublic-school prayer, schools in the 1960s interpreted thedecision to mean they should avoid mentioning religion evenin academic ways. &quot;We were told not to talk about religion --that it is a personal, private thing,&quot; says Ms. Wells.Teachers feared lawsuits or the possibility of becomingembroiled in controversy.   Textbook publishers, concerned that controversy mightderail a possible sale, made matters worse. Of 31 textssurveyed in 1986 by People for the American Way, aconstitutional-issues group, almost all treated religion &quot;byexclusion or by brief and simplistic reference.&quot; One leadingtextbook defined the Pilgrims only as people who went on longjourneys. Another failed to mention that Martin Luther KingJr. was a Christian minister.   &quot;Almost every great social movement of any significance inthe U.S. has been inspired by religious convictions,&quot; saysCharles C. Haynes, executive director of First LibertyInstitute. &quot;For far too long, we've had a remarkable silenceon teaching about religion in the nation's public schools,&quot;Ernest L. Boyer, president of the Carnegie Foundation for theAdvancement of Teaching, said last year.   Without teaching about religion's role, much of history,literature, art or contemporary life is unintelligible, manyeducators now argue. Some see a civic duty: A 1988 surveyfound 67% of Americans unaware that the First Amendmentincludes freedom of religion. Others say as the U.S. becomesmore culturally diverse, children should learn to respectindividual differences and rights.   Still others see such teaching as a guiding light. &quot;A lotof pathology we see -- hostility, malice, failure to vote,teenage pregnancy -- is from a lack of ethical behavior,&quot;says Bill Honig, California's education superintendent, whowants children to strive for a &quot;higher plane.&quot;   Yet, California's pioneering path has been a bumpy one.Christian groups here began lobbying as early as 1987 to getprominent play for Christianity in the texts; and in publichearings last year, each major religious group protested itscharacterization. About 400 Muslims wrote or testified thatthe books presented them as violent, nomadic fanatics. &quot;It'soffensive,&quot; says Shabbir Mansuri, a Muslim who got involvedwith the issue after his daughter brought home a textbookthat he says described Muslims as praying by rubbing theirfaces in the sand.   Jewish groups were most vocal in their objections. TheJewish Community Relations Councils of California, theAmerican Jewish Committee, the American Jewish Congress andthe Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith joined in astatement saying that Judaism is portrayed as a primitivebelief system replaced by a superior one -- Christianity.That, consequently, &quot;places the schools in the position ofadvocating Christianity,&quot; the groups said. They added thatone version of a textbook, later changed, called on childrento act out the final days of Jesus, with Jews in the role ofturning him in to the Romans.   &quot;We don't want to see a textbook that accuses Jews againof being Christ killers,&quot; says an emotional Annette Lawrence,director of the commission on public education for the JewishFederation Council in Los Angeles. &quot;We are going to protectthese kids from becoming anti-Semites.&quot;   Groups questioning the new religious thrust in Californiaschools recently unsuccessfully campaigned to keep new textsfrom being adopted by Long Beach and are waging a similarfight in Oakland.   California's Department of Education argues that revisionshave made the books balanced. Still, Houghton Mifflin Co.,which published the texts, expects more controversy when theyhit most California classrooms in the fall. &quot;It's almost likethe Middle East,&quot; says a Houghton Mifflin spokesman. &quot;We arecaught in a religious quagmire.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
