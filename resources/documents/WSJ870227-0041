The three-member panel headed by former Republican Sen. John Tower of Texas, a staunch supporter of the president, reported yesterday that Mr. Reagan was driven by his desire to free the American hostages in Lebanon. But it said he was unaware of the consequences of his actions, ignorant of what his aides were doing in his name, uninterested in the details of his own foreign policy, and unable to remember some of his most important decisions.    The report paints a devastating picture of how some of the president's top aides undermined their own policies on terrorism and Iran, secretly managed the insurrection against the Nicaraguan government in defiance of Congress, then tried to deceive the public, one another, and even Mr. Reagan himself about what they had done.    &quot;If but one of the major policy mistakes we examined had been avoided, the nation's history would bear one less scar, one less embarrassment, one less opportunity for opponents to reverse the principles this nation seeks to preserve and advance in the world,&quot; the commission said.    These harsh findings are another bodyblow to an administration already reeling from four months of piecemeal disclosures about the scandal, which have badly undermined Mr. Reagan's popularity, his support in Congress and his credibility overseas.    The Tower Commission's report, which includes dozens of previously unreleased internal memoranda and a wealth of new details about both the Iran and Nicaragua operations, is by far the most complete account yet of the disaster that threatens to eclipse what's left of Mr. Reagan's presidency. In the past, the president's aloof management style often deflected criticism onto his advisers, but the report strongly suggests that Mr. Reagan's own failings encouraged the excesses of his aides.    The commission concluded that some of those aides, including White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan, former National Security Advisers Robert McFarlane and Vice Adm. John Poindexter, former Central Intelligence Agency Director William Casey, Secretary of State George Shultz and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, served the president poorly.    Mr. Regan &quot;must bear primary responsibility for the chaos that descended upon the White House&quot; after the secret Iran arms sales were disclosed last November, the panel said. Adm. Poindexter, the report concluded, &quot;failed grievously&quot; to corral the runaway Contra aid operation managed by a zealous subordinate, fired NSC aide Lt. Col. Oliver North.    Mr. McFarlane confessed to the panel that he tried to falsify some of the history of the Iran arms affair to &quot;gild the president's motives&quot; for selling arms to Iran. Mr. Casey failed to police either the Contra operation or the Iran arms sales, although he knew a good deal about both, the report says. Mr. Shultz asked not to be told what was going on, and he and Mr. Weinberger &quot;simply distanced themselves from the program&quot; to protect their own reputations, the commission concluded.    Gen. Brent Scowcroft, a former national security adviser and a member of the Tower Commission, emphasized at a news conference that while much of the criticism is leveled at the NSC, &quot;the president is accountable for its successes and its failures.&quot; The organization, he said, is &quot;unequivocably his.&quot; And former Secretary of State Edmund Muskie, the panel's third member, said the president's detached leadership approach &quot;places an especially heavy responsibility on his key advisers.&quot;    As damning as its conclusions are, the report concedes that some aspects of the affair remain &quot;an enigma.&quot; The panel hadn't any subpoena power, was unable to elicit testimony from three crucial witnesses -- Adm. Poindexter, Col. North and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord -- or from Israeli middlemen in the Iran operation, and hadn't time to untangle the web of front companies and secret bank accounts Col. North used to deliver arms to Iran and to the Nicaraguan rebels.    What's more, the unsworn testimony taken by the commission is replete with instances in which the most senior officials of the administration, including the president, weren't able to agree on or even to recall at all key details of highly important meetings.    While his aides were selling arms and delivering sensitive U.S. intelligence to Iran and thinking up ways to skirt a congressional ban on U.S. military aid to the Nicaraguan rebels, the president generally remained aloof and passive, according to the report.    In a letter to the commission Feb. 20, Mr. Reagan tried to explain why he had changed his testimony on the crucial question of whether he had given advance approval for Israeli arms sales to Iran in 1985, first saying he had, then two weeks later telling the panel he didn't recall doing so.    The president also told the commission, according to the report, that &quot;no one ever discussed with him the provision of intelligence to Iran.&quot; Yet the Jan. 17 directive he signed explicitly authorized the government to provide &quot;intelligence&quot; to outsiders in support of the dealings with Iran. Adm. Poindexter and Col. North repeatedly cited this provision of the directive in overruling the objections of CIA officials to four 1986 deliveries of secret intelligence materials to Tehran via middlemen.    Mr. McFarlane, in recalling his version of the president's approval for the Israeli sales, also offered a rare insight into Mr. Reagan's operating style. According to Mr. McFarlane, the president simply telephoned him in August 1985 and told him to &quot;go ahead with&quot; a plan for Israeli arms sales to Iran in an effort to win the release of the American hostages in Lebanon. &quot;And that, frankly, was more the way the president dealt with an issue, as opposed to saying: 'Well, I like Option 1, 2, 3 or 4,'&quot; Mr. McFarlane told the panel.    Mr. McFarlane told the commission that during the phone conversation he stopped the president to spell out exactly what was involved in approving the Israeli sales, and stopped him two more times to make sure he understood that Messrs. Shultz and Weinberger opposed the idea.    The report also gives details of how, in the three weeks after the secret Iran arms sales were published by a Lebanese magazine, White House officials led by Mr. Regan and Adm. Poindexter scrambled to assemble a history of their policy.    It reports, without comment, that some of the falsehoods concocted by White House aides, including the claims that the administration hadn't traded weapons for hostages and hadn't condoned Israeli arms sales to Iran in 1985, found their way into the president's Nov. 13 speech and his subsequent Nov. 19 news conference.    &quot;There was a deliberate effort to mislead by those who prepared these materials,&quot; Mr. Tower told the news conference. &quot;I don't believe that the president wittingly misled the American people. I think the president was convinced himself of the veracity of what he was saying.&quot;    The aides' strategy of deception, according to the report, included concocting as many as a dozen different chronologies over a 15-day period last November to try to shield Mr. Reagan from the political fallout and to &quot;gild the president's motives&quot; for the arms sales, as Mr. McFarlane acknowledged in his testimony to the commission. There was an &quot;obvious effort&quot; at the White House, Mr. McFarlane testified, to &quot;distance and blur the president's role,&quot; especially concerning prior U.S. approval of the initial Israeli arms sales to Iran.    Adm. Poindexter, Col. North, Mr. McFarlane and others oversaw or helped draft false or misleading chronologies indicating, among other things, that the president never approved the 1985 Israeli sales and &quot;under no circumstances&quot; authorized trading of arms for hostages. The chronologies even gave three different dates for when Mr. Reagan signed a classified directive, called a &quot;finding,&quot; authorizing U.S. arms sales to Iran.    Adm. Poindexter, who was in charge of preparing the account, reportedly said at the time that the orders to prepare a chronology came directly from the president through Mr. Regan, his chief of staff, according to the report.    The commission concluded that the president didn't &quot;intend to mislead the American public or cover up unlawful conduct,&quot; and it didn't draw any conclusions about whether Mr. Regan, in ordering up a chronology, instructed subordinates to incorporate information they knew was false. Mr. Regan has denied doing anything improper.    Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh, however, is investigating the embattled chief of staff's role in the preparation and approval of the final chronology, as well as Mr. Regan's sworn congressional testimony asserting that the president found out about the initial Israeli shipment after the fact.    In some of its strongest language, the commission said it found considerable indications that Col. North &quot;was involved in an effort, over time, to conceal or withhold important information&quot; after the secret initiative to Iran unraveled. The report says that Col. North -- whose secretary has told investigators that he helped her destroy, alter or remove various White House documents last November -- &quot;either on his own or at the behest of others, actively sought to conceal important information&quot; from investigators.    The commission also pointedly raised the possibility, and referred to Mr. Walsh for further investigation, that Adm. Poindexter and Mr. Casey may have participated in a cover-up by lying to Congress last November in explaining the Iran-Contra affair.    Discussing Adm. Poindexter's actions in the aftermath of the arms sales, the commission confirmed reports that first appeared in The Wall Street Journal that some of the former NSC aides' records are missing or can't be located. The commission said it is &quot;concerned that various notes&quot; are missing relating to meetings where Adm. Poindexter &quot;was the official note-taker.&quot;    Nevertheless, the president's commission assembled the most detailed account yet of why and how the U.S. found itself trying to barter anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles for the lives of Americans held captive in Lebanon. The panel's report strongly suggests that the president's desire to free the hostages helped drive his aides, especially Col. North, deeper and deeper into the clutches of untrustworthy middlemen and deceitful Iranian officials who continually raised the prices they had placed on the hostages' heads.    Again, the report suggests that a quality that has served the president well in the past, his optimism, conspired to undo him.    Mr. McFarlane told the commission that when he returned from a meeting with an Iranian intermediary in London in December 1985 and recommended that the operation be abandoned, the president plainly was unhappy. &quot;The president,&quot; Mr. McFarlane said, &quot;was always very hopeful, optimistic . . . always looking for the bright side or the possibility that it could be salvaged.&quot;    Administration officials, in the doctored chronology of the Iran affair and elsewhere, have claimed it was the Israelis who revived the operation in January 1986, when then-Prime Minister Shimon Peres sent his adviser on terrorism, Amiran Nir, to Washington.    But the commission found that although his boss, Mr. McFarlane, had concluded the arms sales were a bad idea, Col. North had prepared a detailed proposal for resuming them on Dec. 9, 1985 -- a month before Mr. Nir came to Washington. In that proposal, and in a separate memo to Adm. Poindexter on Dec. 4, Col. North argued that the secret arms-for-hostages operation couldn't be stopped without risking the lives of the hostages.    In recounting the president's decision to shift gears secretly and to veer away from his tough public stance against terrorists, the report lays bare the bureaucratic squabbling that allowed NSC officials to override objections of cabinet officers and to mislead or withhold crucial information from Secretary Shultz and others.    In the summer of 1985, for example, after Messrs. Shultz and Weinberger expressed strong opposition to selling arms to Iran, NSC officials were forced to shelve their plans temporarily. &quot;Under no circumstances,&quot; Mr. Weinberger told Mr. McFarlane, &quot;should we now ease our restrictions&quot; because &quot;a policy reversal would be seen as inexplicably inconsistent&quot; by other countries.    After that rebuff, according to the report, Mr. McFarlane and his aides decided to pursue their goal by circumventing the administration's formal interagency decision-making procedures.    The Israeli government's offer a few weeks later to serve as an intermediary provided a vehicle for such sales, but the report emphasizes that &quot;it is of paramount importance&quot; to understand that the president &quot;never opposed the idea&quot; of providing Iran with weapons. &quot;Even if Mr. McFarlane did not have the president's explicit prior approval,&quot; according to the report, &quot;he clearly had his full support.&quot;    But the report suggests that the administration may have broken the law by allowing Israel to sell American weapons to Iran without a formal presidential directive. &quot;The legal underpinning of the Iran initiative during 1985 was at best highly questionable,&quot; the report said. &quot; . . . Even if the president approved of these transactions, it is difficult to conclude that his actions constituted adequate legal authority.&quot;    The report paints unflattering portraits of Mr. McFarlane, Adm. Poindexter and Col. North, the three officials most responsible for the execution of the Iran-Contra policies.    Mr. McFarlane emerges as well-meaning but weak, slow to recognize the pitfalls of selling arms to Iran, unable to stop them when he did, and too willing to help fabricate a cover story to protect both the failed policy and the president.    Col. North, according to the report, wasn't the lone ranger his detractors made him out to be, and in fact kept Adm. Poindexter &quot;exhaustively informed&quot; of his byzantine operations to bring home the hostages and to keep the Contras supplied. But the report says the fired NSC aide misrepresented his access to the president, invented fanciful stories of conversations with Mr. Reagan, and misled an Iranian representative about major shifts in U.S. policy toward the Iran-Iraq war.    Adm. Poindexter not only failed to control Col. North's freewheeling and possibly illegal support for the Contras and sought to cover up evidence of possible illegalities, the report says, but repeatedly tried to deceive his colleagues, Congress and the public about NSC activities.    Adm. Poindexter and Col. North have refused to comment on their roles in the Iran-Contra affair. Mr. McFarlane, in a statement released by his lawyer, Leonard Garment, acknowledged that the report has &quot;some hard things to say&quot; but is &quot;full of lessons&quot; and &quot;should be welcomed by anyone who cares about the making of foreign policy.&quot;    (See related story: &quot;Officials in Administration Channeled Military Aid To Rebels During Ban&quot; -- WSJ Feb. 27, 1987)    ---              What Went Wrong at the White House   Here's how the Special Review Board report characterizesthe roles of President Reagan and his principal advisers inthe sale of arms to Iran, in the diversion of funds to theContras or in efforts to limit disclosure of what happened.   -- President Reagan &quot;did not seem to be aware of the wayin which the operation was implemented and the fullconsequences of U.S. participation.&quot;   -- Chief of Staff Donald Regan &quot;as much as anyone, shouldhave insisted that an orderly process be observed. . . .

Col. Oliver North, a member of the NationalSecurity Council staff, &quot;either on his own or at the behestof others, actively sought to conceal important information.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
