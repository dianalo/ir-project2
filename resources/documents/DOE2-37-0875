<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-37-0875 </DOCNO><TEXT>In the authors' model of DNA damage produced by /sup 125/I, the M-XY Augerelectron energy range corresponds with the diameter of a solenoid fiberin chromatin structure. Cell survival studies confirm the cytotoxicityof /sup 125/I decay especially when /sup 125/I is randomly incorporatedinto the nuclear genome (D/sub 0/=96 decays/cell) and not in other subcellularorganelles (e.g. mitochondrial DNA). Within the nucleus, cytotoxicityis increased three fold when only 5% of the nuclear genome is labelledwith /sup 125/I (D/sub 0/=30 decays/cell). Incorporation of /sup 125/Iinto only 5% of the genome was achieved by labelling cells in the presenceof aphidicolin. The mechanism of the increased radiosensitivity is notdue to a predisposed state in the cells to altered DNA damage or repairas measured by alkaline filter elution nor to selective irradiation ofreplication forks.</TEXT></DOC>
