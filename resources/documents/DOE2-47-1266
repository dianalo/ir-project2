The experimental results confirmthat a new algorithm developed at Materials Research Laboratory has potentialfor the automatic inspection of these assemblies and of others that containdiscrete components. The algorithm was applied to images that containa range of grey levels and has been found to be tolerant to image variationsencountered under simulated production conditions.</TEXT></DOC>
