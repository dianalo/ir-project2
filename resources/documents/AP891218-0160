The president, meanwhile, urged critics of his China policy to``be a little patient.''   Word of the July trip came as Bush was still defending himselffrom criticism for having sent aides to Beijing earlier this month.Brent Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser, ledboth missions, accompanied by Lawrence Eagleburger, the deputysecretary of state.   Scowcroft's first trip, kept secret until now, came a monthafter Chinese troops crushed a pro-democracy movement, killinghundreds of demonstrators.   Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., chairman of the Subcommittee onInternational Economic Policy and Trade of the House ForeignAffairs Committee, said Bush had ``misled the American people andthe Congress.''   ``How does the White House square that (earlier trip) with theirstatements at the time that high-level contacts with the Chinesewere cut off,'' Gejdenson said.   Ron Brown, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said,``There has not been a decision so out of touch with Americanvalues since the sale of arms to the Ayatollah. ... President Bushhas demonstrated yet again that he doesn't see the connectionbetween human lives, human rights and an effectvie foreign policy.''   A White House statement Monday said the July trip was intendedto underscore U.S. ``shock and concern about the violence inTiananmen Square and to impress upon the Chinese government theseriousness with which this incident was viewed in the UnitedStates.''   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said he could notrule out the possibility that Scowcroft or other U.S. officials hadmade other trips to China that still remain secret.   The White House confirmed the July visit only because it wasreported by the Cable News Network, Fitzwater said. The Decembervisit was disclosed after Scowcroft and Eagleburger had landed inBeijing.   Of the July trip, Fitzwater said, ``The president has had yearsof experience with China, and he knows that face-to-facedeclarations are important to them.''   Bush, meanwhile, said that criticism ignited by news of the Dec.8 trip was subsiding and that remaining skeptics should ``be alittle patient and wait and see'' how Beijing responds.   ``They've been dealing with emotion and not facts. Once theydeal with a full deck, I expect people will understand it,'' Bushsaid.   He refused to say whether China had offered any concessions inreturn for his decision to rekindle relations with Beijing in theaftermath of the June killings.   Bush said he does not know when Chinese dissident Fang Lizhiwould be able to leave the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, where he hastaken refuge since the crackdown. Fitzwater said Scowcroft haddenied there were any negotiations going on with China about anacceptable country where Fang might go.   The president, who has been accused by Democrats of``kowtowing'' to the Chinese leaders, said, ``I'm just going tostay with my position and take on a little heat from time to time.''   Already, Bush said, ``I notice now that some of the critics whowere so opposed and using this fantastically, diabolically anti-melanguage, they come up now saying, `Well, if you get a, b and c,then it will be all right or then we'll understand. Let them juststay tuned in.''   Bush made his comments in a year-end interview with TheAssociated Press and three other news agencies.   On other topics, the president:   _Said a bill he signed to bail out the savings and loan industrywas ``a major accomplishment but I continue to worry about theSandamp;Ls.'' He did not elaborate.   _Said his pledge against raising taxes this year was good for1990 ``as far as I`m concerned.'' He said he had kept his vow in1989 ``and I want to continue keeping it.''   _Scoffed at reports that Colombian drug lords had put up a $30million assassination contract on his life. ``There is nothing toit,'' Bush said. ``Let me take this opportunity to reassure theAmerican people that we will not unduly risk anyone's life here andthat ... I feel confident that the security provisions in Cartagenawill guarantee the safety of the president of the United States.''Bush plans to attend a meeting of Andean leaders in the Colombiancity in February to discuss the drug fight.   _Said he felt ``enormous frustration'' that Americans are stillheld as hostages in Lebanon. ``It's on my mind an awful lot,'' Bushsaid, adding that he had written notes recently to families of thehostages. The president said the tone of moderation in Iran afterthe death of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini has not been backed upby action.   _Said the United States will not compel Israel to deal with thePalestine Liberation Organization to get peace in the Middle East.Bush also said he was frustrated by the violence in Lebanon.   _Declared the United States will play ``an active andappropriate role'' in encouraging democratic reforms in EasternEurope but said those changes will not automatically translate intohuge spending cuts for the Pentagon.   On another matter, Bush said he felt ``enormous frustration''that Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega remained in powerdespite U.S. sanctions and support for a failed coup attempt inOctober.   The president said the weekend slaying of an American officer inPanama was ``an enormous outrage and a matter of enormous concernto this president.''   Asked if the United States was powerless to act, Bush said, ``Ithink a president, all presidents, have options, but they don'tdiscuss what they might be.'' He repeated that answer when asked ifmilitary steps were being considered.</TEXT></DOC>
