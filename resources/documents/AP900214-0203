Promoters put it this way: Break rocks. Get muddy and sweaty.Dig in the dirt. Sleep with rhododendron, laurel and bears. Splitlogs. Bridge bogs with the logs you split.   If that isn't incentive enough, the Appalachian Trail Conferencepromises that volunteers will ``get a strange T-shirt your oldfriends won't understand and your mother won't want you to wear.''   Volunteers conceived and built the hiking trail in the 1920s and1930s and have managed and maintained the path ever since.Gradually, the trail gained support from national forest and parkauthorities and from the states involved.   In 1968, the route was officially designated by Congress as anational scenic trail. The 65-year-old private, non-profitAppalachian Trail Conference was appointed the footpath'sday-to-day caretaker in 1984.   The Forest Service in the Agriculture Department and theNational Park Service in the Interior Department are majorsponsors. The trail connects eight national forests, six nationalpark units and more than 60 state park, game and forest lands.   ``It winds its way along the crests of the mountains, acrossfarm valleys, and through rugged and secluded high country,'' saysthe conference. ``Almost all the trail is located on lands ownedeither by the National Park Service, the U.S. Forest Service,states or other public bodies.''   Spokesman Brian King said in a telephone interview fromconference headquarters in Harpers Ferry, W.Va., that he had notabulation of 1989 work for the entire trail but that the southerncrew, for example, had 80 volunteers who worked 8,500 hours andbuilt 7.7 miles of footpath, along with bridges, one shelter andthree outhouses.   The seasonal crews of volunteers began in 1983 in southwesternVirginia, and a mid-Atlantic crew started in Pennsylvania in 1984.The conference also works with New England clubs to finance andrecruit season workers in that area.   The conference is comprised of 31 clubs and 24,000 individualand family members.   The southern crew, which works in Virginia, North Carolina andTennessee in the late spring and summer, is based in the MountRogers National Recreation Area in southwestern Virginia.   Mid-Atlantic operations are scheduled in September and Octoberin Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York andNew Jersey.   King said volunteers have come from all across the United Statesand there are usually two or three from overseas, often fromBritain.   The conference's recruiting literature says the volunteer teams``concentrate on trail construction and resource-managementprojects that might not otherwise be tackled by local maintainingclubs or public agencies with limited budgets.''   Work includes trail design and construction, shelter and bridgeconstruction, rough carpentry, rehabilitation of eroded trails,clearing and open-area management.   ``The work is often physically demanding, requiring perseveranceand patience while living with limited comforts in the outdoors,''the report said. ``Trail crews of four to six volunteers are led bya skilled leader on projects from Thursday through Monday andreturn to a base camp for Tuesday-Wednesday weekends, when membersmay explore area attractions.''   Volunteer crew members can opt to work for a week or the wholeseason. Anyone age 18 or older, male and female, can apply. Thereis no age limit.   ``Enthusiasm, good health and adaptabilaity are importantprerequisites,'' the report said. ``Willingness to followinginstruction and safety rules and to share equally in camp chores isessential. Previous experience is helpful but not necessary.''   Once a volunteer reachs a base camp, most expenses are covered,including lodging, food, transportation to and from work sites,tools, safety equipment, group camping gear (as available), and ``asmall weekly stipend'' for laundry and incidentals.
