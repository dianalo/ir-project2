North and his co-defendantsperpetrated ``a classic fraud on government'' when they divertedprofits from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to help arm the Nicaraguanrebels, prosecutors said.   Responding to North's contention that he did not defraud thegovernment, prosecutors said the four Iran-Contra defendants createda ``secret slush fund'' for activities ``outside the normal channelsof governmental accountability.''   By overcharging Iran for weapons in the arms-for-hostagetransactions, North and the others undermined President Reagan'sinitiative to free Americans held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian groups,independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh said in pleadings filedTuesday.   North and former national security adviser John M. Poindexter``chose to advance their private, unauthorized ends at the cost ofputting at hazard the ends they were supposed to be pursuing,including that of saving the lives of the Americans held hostage inLebanon.''   North, Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakim and retired AirForce Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord are charged with conspiring todefraud the government and theft by diverting more than $14 millionin arms-sale profits to a criminal ``enterprise'' that secretlyfinanced the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.   North's lawyers contended in pleadings filed Oct. 11 that therewas no fraud or theft because the government didn't own the weaponsafter they were sold to Secord and Hakim, who acted as middlemen inthe transactions.   But Walsh said the alleged scheme ``constitutes a classic fraudon the government.''   ``The thrust of the fraud is the breach of the public trust:Poindexter's and North's discharge of their official duties (e.g.,execution of the Iran initiative) was driven by a concealed andwholly improper motive _ a desire to generate a slush fund for usein financing unauthorized activities designated by them.''   Prosecutors said North, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel,``exploited his position to exact from Iranians a high sellingprice, while concealing from the government the nature of the pricespread and his control over the excess profits.''   ``The goals of establishing improved relations with Iran andpotentially securing the release of American hostages held by groupssympathetic to that country were undermined and put seriously atrisk by the conspirators' private motive to charge prices well inexcess of what otherwise might have been charged in order to secureadditional profits,'' the prosecution said.   ``Defendants Secord and Hakim agreed to hold funds generated byNorth and to apply them to purposes selected by North and Poindexteroutside the normal challenges of governmental accountability,''prosecutors said.   Secord and Hakim ``reaped lucrative profits from the money Northsteered to them'' as middlemen in the transactions, prosecutors said.   Prosecutors said they were not required to show that thedefendants' activities undermined Reagan's effort to free thehostages. ``It is enough that it was reasonably foreseeable thatthey would have that effect, as it clearly was.''   No date has been set for the trial of North, the first of fourtrials ordered by U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell.</TEXT></DOC>
