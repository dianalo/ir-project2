Telephone (202)523-8151.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>In June 1986, OSHA issued revised standardsgoverning occupational exposure to asbestos, tremolite, anthophyllite andactinolite for general industry and construction which were to be effectiveon July 21, 1986. (See 51 FR 22812 <T3>et seq.</T3>, June 20, 1986).On October 17, 1986 OSHA issued a partial stay of the revised standardsinsofar as they apply to occupational exposure to non-asbestiform tremolite,anthophyllite and actinolite, in order to enable the Agency to review newsubmissions raising questions about the appropriateness of regulating theseminerals in the revised asbestos standards, and to allow sufficient timeto reopen the rulemaking record and conduct supplemental rulemaking proceedingslimited to this issue (51 FR 37002).OSHA extended the stay until July 21, 1988 in a notice published on April30, 1987. (52 FR 15722). At that time OSHA stated that it was beginningto draft a notice of proposed rulemaking and was collecting data relatingto the issue of whether and how to regulate these non-asbestiform mineralsincluding the feasibility of regulating all impacted industries. The lengthof the initial partial stay had proven inadequate for the Agency to completethe rulemaking procedures contemplated because of the variety of the impactedindustries.Because of the problems described in the previous notice, OSHA now anticipatesthat it can publish a notice of proposed rulemaking concerning how to regulaterulemaking concerning how to regulate the non-asbestiform minerals in October1988. Thus, the stay extension announced in this notice is necessary tocontinue to collect and analyze sufficient health and feasibility data,to draft a supplemental rulemaking proposal and to complete the rulemakingcalled for. The agency believes, based on its current priorities and theestimates of agency staff and contractors, that the extension announcedin this notice, <T3>i.e.</T3> until July 21, 1989, realistically reflects the time neededto conclude supplemental rulemaking on the regulation of non-asbestiformtremolite, anthophyllite and actinolite.As was the case with the initial partial stay, the 1972 standard governingoccupational exposure to asbestos (redesignated 29 CFR 1910.1101) willremain in effect to the extent of the stay during the period of the extension.The full text of the stay with respect to these non-asbestiform mineralswas published in the October 17, 1986 <T4>Federal Register</T4> (51 FR 37002).With respect to the extension of the partial stay, OSHA finds that advancenotice and opportunity for comment are impractical and unnecessary withinthe meaning of 5 U.S.C. 553 in view of the limited duration of the extensionand the continued applicability of the 1972 standard (29 CFR 1910.1101)to cover the gaps in coverage created by the partial stay.The minor amendments to the notes to 29 CFR 1910.1001, 1910.1101, and 1926.58,similarly are made without advance notice and opportunity for comment.OSHA finds such process unnecessary and impracticable in that the changesmerely reference the extension of the stay and restate the applicabilityof the 1972 standard.No evidentiary issues are involved.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 29 CFR Parts 1910 and 1926</ITAG>Asbestos, Occupational safety and health.<ITAG tagnum="84">Authority and Signature</ITAG>This document was prepared under the direction of John A.
