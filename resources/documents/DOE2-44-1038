<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-44-1038 </DOCNO><TEXT>A two dimensional fault simulation model has been developed which permitsrelative movement of the faulted blocks (normal and reverse), and openor closed fluid flow conditions. Simultaneous simulation of a numberof vertical line faults, horst and grabens is included, giving the modelgreat flexibility. Application to the Pinedale anticline, Green RiverBasin, Wyoming, showed that the model can (1) simulate sedimentationprocesses, including normal sedimentation, erosion and hiatus, (2) simulatestructural development, including general structural styles (anticlinalor synclinal), faults, and horst and grabens, and (3) predict the geothermalhistory and the evolution of geological parameters such as formationtemperature, fluid pressure, abnormal pressure and vitrinite reflectance.From these parameters maturation of organic matter is assessed. Finally,(4) the model can quantify oil generation, migration and accumulationthrough geological time. The results are shown to be consistent withdownhole experimental data and can be presented as graphs either in oneor two dimensions, providing a pictorial representation of evolutionof the Pinedale Anticline.</TEXT></DOC>
