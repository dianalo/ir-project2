<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-39-0394 </DOCNO><TEXT>The book deals intensively with two interpretations of the nuclear controversy,their different approaches formulating two poles of conceivable criticismof the role of the political parties in the nuclear controversy: 1) Conservativeinterpretations nourish frustration over the stop of the nuclear powerprogramme and put the blame exclusively on the political parties, sothat their role appears dysfunctional in the process of technologicalprocess that is determined by the technical facts. 2) Materialistic analysesanticipate the smooth functioning of the nuclear power programme andforget about the political parties, so that their role in this approachappears to be irrelevant to the enforcement of capitalistic logics orof the interests of the nuclear power industry. An empirical criticismof the case opposes both approaches. Arguments against the one show thatthe political parties played a relevant role in the development of nuclearpower technology in the F.R.G., and arguments against the other showthat the parties' influence in the process was by no means dysfunctional.The concluding statement is that the blocking impact of the Social DemocraticParty has been quite a functional one in the economic development ofthe nuclear power programme within the framework set by the 'Modell Deutschland'.The Social Democratic Party actually got hooked up in a dilemma in thewake of the nuclear controversy, and the book analyses the Party's currentsituation.
