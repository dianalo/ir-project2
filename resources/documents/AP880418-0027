The rate policy adopted after the breakup of American Telephoneandamp; Telegraph Co. requires long-distance carriers to bear _ and share_ some of the equipment and distribution costs of local telephonecompanies.   But the Northeast-Midwest Institute, a research and lobbyinggroup serving 18 states, says pooling rates to spread out thenon-traffic costs favors the South and West at the expense of the``Rust Belt.''   ``The Federal Communications Commission requires the averagetelephone subscriber in the Northeast-Midwest to pay more foraccess than it actually costs to provide,'' it said in a recentreport on telecommunications policy.   ``The additional payments are then used to subsidizelong-distance access for subscribers in states such as Florida,California and Colorado.''   Although the FCC has begun eliminating pooling gradually, theinstitute said it should have followed the lead of Illinois andstarted the phaseout years ago.   Illinois has been shifting an increasing share of non-trafficcosts from long-distance carriers to local-calling companies since1984, Madelon Kuchera of the Illinois Commerce Commission saidFriday.   ``Every year that we transition more to the end-user, thelong-distance carriers are forced to pass those savings along inlower rates,'' she said. ``So within Illinois, long-distance rateshave decreased almost 30 percent.''   For example, Candamp;P Telephone Co. in the nation's capital said itcosts 71 cents for a three-minute, direct-dial call fromSpringfield to Belleville in Illinois during weekday business hours.   In comparison, it said a similar call covering about the samedistance in Texas, from Austin to San Antonio, costs 99 cents _ 39percent more than the Illinois call.   Similar savings could be achieved on calls outside the state'sborders if the rate structure was not inflated to help otherregions, Ms. Kuchera said.   ``We've always argued that we don't like subsidizing Florida andCalifornia,'' she said. ``If we could have the rates reflect ourtrue costs, they would be much less.''</TEXT></DOC>
