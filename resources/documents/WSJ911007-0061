A few weeks ago, some analysts were predicting gold priceswould skid to $300 an ounce or maybe even to $250 -- thelowest levels since the 1970s. Adjusted for inflation, spotgold at the recent low of $341 had already fallen to 1978levels.</LP><TEXT>   But now, with gold for October delivery rising every daylast week and closing Friday at $359, up nearly $10 for theweek, some of those market-watchers are raising theirforecasts as fears of heavy Soviet gold sales subside.   David Lundgren, an analyst with Technical Data, previouslythought prices were setting up for another wave of selling to$300 and perhaps $281. The strength in gold prices last week,however, has changed the technical indicators, he says, andprices are poised to move up.   The market environment has moved away from heavynegativism amid disclosures that the Soviet Union doesn'thave as much gold as people thought, Mr. Lundgren says.Unless something happens to alter that perception again, thefloor on gold prices should be around $350, he says.   Jeffrey Nichols, the Boca Raton, Fla., publisher of MetalsFax newsletter, said he thought gold was oversold last monthbut saw the possibility of a further plunge to $325. He stillsays trader nervousness could cause gold to drop to around$325 on any bearish news or rumors, but he sees a moreprobable range for gold at $345 to $365 through year's end.   Some analysts still stick to their pessimistic views.Joseph Rosta, analyst at CPM Group in New York, says priceshad been falling on technical factors -- investors sold offwhen spot gold fell below the psychologically and technicallyimportant level of $350. He sees prices drifting down to the$330s and $320s within six weeks.   August Arace, co-manager of the Freedom Gold andamp; GovernmentTrust, still sees gold prices in the low $300s, with a 50-50chance of prices falling as low as $250 within the next sixmonths to a year.   And James Steel, analyst at Refco, stands firm in hisprediction that gold prices, though they could rally in theshort term, will fall to $325 by Christmas.   The turmoil in the Soviet Union is partly to blame for thelingering bearish sentiment. But even before the Sovietproblems surfaced, investors were disappointed by gold'slackluster performance. Gold prices have declined about 20%from their 1987 average of $446.07, and trading has beenstuck between $350 and $425 for almost three years.   As a result, gold futures volume on the Commodity Exchangethis year was off by a third through September. In August,volume was 62% lower than a year earlier, and September wasdown 42%.   Even as gold prices have weakened, the supply-and-demandpicture has been improving. Jewelry demand in the first sixmonths matched record highs of a year earlier, and Juneshowed an increase of 6.1%, according to the World GoldCouncil.   And over the longer term, the market won't have to absorba swelling supply as it has in recent years. Between 1985 and1990, Western mine production grew 40%, according to GoldFields Mineral Services. Looking ahead, however, a survey bythe Gold Institute, an industry association, indicates worldproduction will grow 4% next year, then slow to 1% growth in1993 and to no growth in 1994.   Those improving fundamentals lead Gordon Parker, chairmanof Newmont Gold Co., to believe gold prices have hit bottomor are close to it. But he adds that he doesn't expect muchstrength, citing a lack of investor interest.   &quot;For whatever reason, investors haven't been active in themarket for some time,&quot; he says. &quot;Until they return there'snot going to be a significant upward movement.&quot; Newmont,which produces 1.5 million ounces of gold a year, hasresponded to lower prices by trimming its cash productioncosts to $208 an ounce from $218 last year.   Harry Conger, chairman of Homestake Mining Co., whichproduces about a million ounces of gold a year, says that byany historical measure, gold prices are low. There's no wayof knowing whether this is the absolute low, he says, but,&quot;I'm in the camp that says it is the bottom and has one wayto go -- up.&quot; Mr. Conger has reason to hope for higherprices: Gold at current levels is coming uncomfortably closeto Homestake's cash production costs of about $320 to $325.   Some gold bulls stand by their outlooks as well. PeterBorish, director of research for Tudor Investment Corp. inNew York, says nothing has changed to alter his view thatgold's relative attractiveness as an investment will grow. Hesays recent Federal Reserve actions such as lowering interestrates will tend to support gold in the longer run. &quot;Ourprevious thoughts haven't changed that much, even though ourequity has,&quot; he says, implying that Tudor has lost money onits gold positions. &quot;Unfortunately, the market is alwaysright.&quot;   James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observernewsletter, also sticks to his forecast of higher gold pricesdown the road, but he says they could fall first.   Eventually people's &quot;devout faith&quot; in central banks'ability to manipulate the economy will be shattered, hepredicted, and they will turn to the monetary asset thatisn't connected with the commercial or central bankingsystems -- gold.   Ian MacDonald, vice president of precious metals at CreditSuisse, says he doubts prices will drop below $300 an ouncebecause so many mines would be forced to close at that pricethat supply would be severely curtailed. And demand, whichhas been increasing sharply each time the price tumbles,would limit price declines, he says.   Still, he adds, gold's troubles aren't over. While demandthis year could match last year's record level, there hasbeen more supply this year, he says. Gold will have to gothrough a few more tests of the lows, he says, &quot;to see ifwe're out of the woods.&quot;   Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week:                                                                                                          Grains and Soybeans                                                                                                          Wheat and soybean futures prices will get a boost todayfrom an allocation of U.S. export credits to the Soviet Unionthat provides for large purchases of the two grains and theirbyproducts. The allocation for corn purchases, however, wasmuch smaller than most analysts had predicted, and cornfutures prices are expected to decline today.   The final $400 million in U.S. export credits granted thisyear by the Bush administration breaks down as $132 millionfor wheat; $99 million for protein meal, including soybeanmeal; $73 million for soybeans; $51 million for feed grains,including corn; $15 million for poultry; and $30 million forshipping.   Perhaps the biggest surprise in the package was the $51million allocation for feed grains, which will allow forpurchases of only about 400,000 metric tons of corn. Analystshad been expecting the Soviets to buy roughly three timestimes that much corn, and the corn futures market at theChicago Board of Trade had built its prices around the higherexpectations.   The large allocation for purchases of soybeans and soybeanmeal may indicate that the Soviet need for shelf-ready foodproducts is less acute than was thought, said Daniel W.Basse, market research director for AgResource Co., Chicago.Soybeans and their byproducts require time-consumingprocessing, and Moscow could have used its credit to buy moreimmediately usable foods if it needed them, Mr. Basse said.   Also this week, traders will be speculating on thecontents of a monthly U.S. Agriculture Department cropproduction report due out Thursday. The report will containthe department's projections of the damage, if any, thatearly frost inflicted on crops throughout the northernMidwest and Plains states.                                                                                                          Energy                                                                                                          The Soviet Union's oil export capabilities and thevagaries of fall weather are among the uncertainties thatprobably will continue to bolster crude oil prices. Despitebearish inventory reports last week, crude oil prices movedhigher on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Traders seemedinclined to bet on some currently unforeseen event or seriesof events tightening up world supplies of crude. Even withthe determined bullishness in the market, however, prices areapparently beginning to encounter some resistance to movinghigher. Friday's trading on the Merc ended with Novembercrude six cents a barrel lower at $22.61.</TEXT></DOC>
