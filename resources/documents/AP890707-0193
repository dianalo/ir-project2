She stars in the NBC comedy series ``Just the Ten of Us'' as oneof the daughters, and she's the spokeswoman for Hasbro's Maxie dollin commercials and personal appearances.   She also recently boarded a cruise ship for an NBC movietentatively called ``Semester at Sea,'' and in ``Nightmare on ElmStreet IV: The Dreammaster'' last year, she turned into a giantcockroach.   Theiss tries hard because she has to. She suffers from a learningdisability called dyslexia.   ``I make personal appearances before girls' groups and talk aboutmy dyslexia and being held back,'' she said.   ``I almost flunked kindergarten. I couldn't read. It wasn't untilthe third grade that I was tested and diagnosed as having dyslexia.I didn't know my left from my right. I have trouble dialing thetelephone. Everyone has some problem. I've learned some otherartists have dyslexia _ Tom Cruise, Cher, writer Stephen Cannell.''   She took special classes in school and learned to read withrelative ease. But she also admits that ``we were a little toopampered in some classes. I'd even use dyslexia as an excuse untilcollege. I wasn't really motivated until then.''   After high school, she attended New York University, which shesaid has a special program for dyslexics. All of her books wereavailable on audio tape.   She grew up in Los Angeles, the daughter of an advertisingexecutive and a real estate saleswoman. But acting was in her genes.Her mother, Kathy Mitchell, had been a model and actress whoappeared in many live television productions in the 1950s. Herfather, Dick Thies, had played the villain in Western movies beforegoing into advertising. Brooke changed the spelling of her last nameto make it easier to pronounce.   Her first break was the contract to represent the Maxie doll.   ``They were looking for someone who looked like the doll,'' saidTheiss, a petite blonde who looks younger than her 19 years. ``Ihave a big wig and clothes that look like all her costumes. Parentsbring their kids to my personal appearances and talk to me like I'm12 years old.   ``The Maxie doll is a fashion doll for children too young forBarbie. When you're 12 you don't think about a career. You dreamabout going to the prom and getting your driver's license.''   She had just returned to New York from filming some dollcommercials when she got a call to appear on ABC's ``GrowingPains.'' The comedy ``Just the Ten of Us'' began as a spinoff of``Growing Pains'' in January 1988.   Flying to Los Angeles on Sunday, she auditioned on Monday, gotthe role later that day and began work on Wednesday.   She plays Wendy Lubbock, one of eight children of the footballcoach at an all-boys school. Jamie Luner is her twin sister, Cindy,and Bill Kirchenbauer and Deborah Harmon are the parents.   ``We play them as 16,'' she said. ``Wendy is very rambunctiousand rowdy. She's fun-loving and has no regrets. She takes risks,she's the instigator. Cindy's more sensible and subtle. All the kidsare different and have well-developed personalities.''   Prior to the spinoff she'd made a guest appearance on ``GrowingPains'' as another character.   She was first cast in a small role in the movie ``LittleNikita,'' which starred Sidney Poitier and River Phoenix.   ``When they screened the movie I went with my mother andgrandmother,'' she said. ``I told my mother when my part was comingup. They cut my part out of the movie. My grandmother, who doesn'thear well, said very loudly, `Did they cut it?'''   Her new movie is about a shipboard rivalry between the studentsfrom two schools on a cruise-and-study tour. NBC will telecast themovie next season. It's being filmed on a five-day cruise toCatalina and Ensenada, Mexico.   She remembers ``Nightmare on Elm Street'' as one of her mostenjoyable roles.   ``I was in makeup two hours every day to play the cockroach,''said Theiss. ``I ran into a cockroach trap and have this slimy stuffall over me. It's the gooey stuff they use for filled donuts. I hadto stick my face in it. I thought it was so funny.   ``My costume was made of rubber foam. I had extra legs andantennae sticking out. I remember once at three o'clock in themorning, I had cables all over me to control the legs and antennaeand all these people manipulating the cables. At the end, they didme in. I got squashed.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions July 21-23</NOTE></DOC>
