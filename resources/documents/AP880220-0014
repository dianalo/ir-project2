MILLER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>GUATEMALA CITY (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Peace talks between Nicaragua's leftistSandinista government and Contra rebels are right back where theybegan _ mired in a dispute over what comes first, democracy or atruce.   Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, the Nicaraguan Roman CatholicChurch leader who has been mediating the negotiations, abruptlysuspended the latest round of talks Friday, indirectly blaming theSandinistas for their failure.   Obando y Bravo said he was disappointed that both sides had notaccepted, at least in principle, a proposal he put forth Thursdayin an attempt to break a deadlock that arose in the first hours ofthe talks.   That impasse stemmed from what the cardinal said was theinability of the two sides to agree on whether they shouldnegotiate a cease-fire to obtain democracy, or negotiate democracyto obtain a cease-fire.   More than 40,000 people have been killed since November 1981,when the Contras began fighting the Sandinista government.   The cardinal's plan called on the Contras to accept a truce inexchange for four major concessions by the government. They wereconcessions the Contras have long sought, and they quickly acceptedthe proposal in principle.   But Victor Hugo Tinoco, Nicaragua's deputy foreign minister,said the cardinal suspended the talks in mid-afternoon Fridaybefore he could deliver his government's formal, written response,which also conditionally accepted the plan.   The confusion apparently arose because President Daniel Ortegainitially instructed his negotiators to reject Obando y Bravo'sproposal as unsuitable for discussion at talks the Sandinistaleader felt should be aimed solely at the mechanics of achieving acease-fire.   The government apparently changed its mind later and authorizedTinoco to accept conditionally the cardinal's plan. By then, Obandoy Bravo had suspended the negotiations without setting a time orplace for a new round of talks.   Contra negotiators announced their tentative acceptance ofObando y Bravo's proposal at a news conference Thursday night.Shortly afterward, Tinoco told reporters the plan was ``interestingand constructive,'' but needed clarification.   Paul Reichler, a Washington, D.C., attorney advising theSandinistas, said Ortega advised the government negotiators duringa telephone conference later Thursday evening to reject Obando yBravo's proposal.   Reichler quoted Ortega as saying that if Obando y Bravo felt theissues he raised in his proposal were of vital importance to theNicaraguan people, the president would discuss them with thecardinal personally.   But Reichler said Ortega's initial reaction was that he wouldnot discuss political issues at the bargaining table with theContras _ a position the Nicaraguan leader has long held.   Obando y Bravo's plan called for the Contras to move intounspecified ``enclaves or zones'' with their arms and equipmentduring a 30-day truce, during which talks would continue toward amore lasting cease-fire.   In exchange, the cardinal called on the Nicaraguan government to:   _Grant a ``full, general'' amnesty to the several thousandpolitical prisoners in Nicaraguan jails, including members of theNational Guard of former dictator Gen. Anastasio Somoza, whom theSandinistas overthrew in 1979.   _Permit ``unrestricted'' freedom of the press, a right nowgranted only to a few mass media, including the oppositionnewspaper La Prensa and Radio Catolica, the voice of the CatholicChurch.   _``Reconsider'' mandatory military draft law, which has provokedviolent disturbances by youths and mothers of draft-age people inseveral Nicaraguan cities.   _Reopen a dialogue with its internal opposition, including 14dissident political parties and a coalition of business, labor andpolitical groups known as the Democratic Coordinating Council.Those talks broke down late last year.   Tinoco's initial response and the government's later writtenstatement said the Obando y Bravo plan needed clarification on thesize and location of the cease-fire zones, when the truce wouldstart, how it would be verified and how the Contras would besupplied during the cessation of hostilities.   Reichler said Ortega suggested that Roger Fisher, a Harvardprofessor who heads the Center for Conflict Resolution in Boston,draw up a new cease-fire proposal, drawing on plans alreadysubmitted by both sides.   But in announcing suspension of the talks, Obando y Bravo issueda communique rejecting Fisher's participation in the negotiations.The communique said such work was the proper task of each side'stechnical advisers.</TEXT></DOC>
