Terms weren't disclosed.    Sterling Faucet is a Schaumburg, Ill.-based maker of bathroom faucets. It is a unit of closely held Kohler Co.    Owens-Corning is selling the division, which makes bathroom fixtures, as part of a restructuring and recapitalization plan that was formulated to stave off a $2.1 billion hostile tender offer by Wickes Cos. last year. The unit had sales of about $52 million in 1986.    Owens-Corning Fiberglas makes glass-fiber insulation and construction products. </TEXT></DOC>
