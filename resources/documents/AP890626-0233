VHS-Beta, $89.95.Rated R)      ``True Believer'' is fun to watch. Unfortunately, it is notbelievable.   James Woods plays, with his trademark intensity, Eddie Dodd, apioneering civil rights lawyer who lost his 1960s spirit on the wayto the '80s. He finds himself defending mostly drug dealers, anddefending himself for doing so.   Along comes a young lawyer, Roger (Robert Downey Jr.), whoworships Dodd's earlier work, and an 8-year-old murder case in whichthe defendant might actually be innocent. Dodd is reluctant to takethe case, and Roger sneers, ``It was close, huh? We almost defendedsomeone who wasn't a drug dealer.''   But Dodd plunges into the case, and he also finds he's fightingpublic corruption and various urban evils.   The problem with the movie, directed by Joseph Ruben, is thatinstead of taking a close look at Dodd's disillusionment, or at therelationship between Dodd and Roger, ``True Believer'' takes theeasy way out and goes for the thrills.   For starters, the old murder is recreated, Dodd is beaten up by aphony white supremacist, and there's a crazy and dangerous chasethrough a plumbing supply factory. On the good side, the ending isclever.   Downey is fine, as is Yuji Okumoto playing the convict andMargaret Colin as a private detective.   _ By Mary MacVean, Associated Press Writer.</TEXT><TEXT>      ``The Midnight Hour'' (Vidmark, VHS-Beta, $89.95)      ``The Midnight Hour'' is a good little vampire, witches andghouls tale starring Shari Belafonte-Harper as a witch who bringsterror to a small town on Halloween.   Although there are recognizable names in the movie, the actingleaves much to be desired. Co-starring are: Levar Burton, LeeMontgomery, Dick Van Patten, Kevin McCarthy, Jonelle Allen, DedeePfeifer and Cindy Morgan.   And for a horror flick, the chills are as lacking as the thespianskills.   Nonetheless, it is still an enjoyable romp as the the town'scemetery residents climb out of their graves and munch, rip andmutilate their way through the night, joining trick-or-treaters andcrashing a halloween party.   The game then becomes how to get the baddies back in the graveand the townsfolk back to normal. Along the way, there are a fewchuckles.   And despite all its flaws, ``The Midnight Hour'' is an adequatelittle horror flick for a rainy Saturday afternoon.   _ By Chris French, Associated Press Writer</TEXT><TEXT>   Motion Picture Association of America rating definitions:   G _ General audiences.
