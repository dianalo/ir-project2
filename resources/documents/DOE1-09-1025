<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-09-1025 </DOCNO><TEXT>Electric wires for power and telephone circuit installed overhead alongthe road as well as their poles have several problematic points suchas interference to fine fighting activities, causes of accidents on theoccasion of earthquake, hindrance to pedestrian passage, obstacles tovehicle drivers' view, unsightliness to the appearance of urban areaand the like, which leads to urgent necessity of changing them to undergroundsystem. As a conventional method of installing underground system, theone called a tube system was generally employed. But the latter has severaldrowbacks such as inability to respond to the increase of demands largerthan a certain amount, necessity of intermittent digging up of the roadfor the service entrances to customers newly settled along the road,difficulties in cable maintenance jobs, frequent accidents caused byother installation work for dedicated services, and so on. As a new undergroundsystem to cope with these problems the CAB system is proposed. This systemis a duct provided with cover plate and installed mainly in the pedestrianwalk, the sidewall of which is a knock-out type one provided with a thinthickness portions made of unreinforced concrete and in which varioussorts of wires are installed collectively. The progress hitherto andfuture prospect of this system are described and examples of installationwork thereof are presented. (7 figs, 3 tabs, 3 photos)</TEXT></DOC>
