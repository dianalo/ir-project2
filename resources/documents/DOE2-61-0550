In 1987, Storaproduced about 160,000 tonnes of market pulp where their resource baseincreasingly consisted of hardwood. The company uses hardwood chips fora growing percentage of its annual pulp production and for its hog fuelboiler, but became faced with having to use more local hardwoods whichcontributes to the resin problem. Their solution was to construct a 12-tpdchlorine dioxide generator, a process using dry sodium chlorate addedto concentrated H/sub 2/SO/sub 4/, The products are chlorine dioxideand highly concentrated sulphuric acid resulting from the eliminationof water at the starting point. This will eliminate the acid effluentfrom the generator and the sulphuric acid will be recycled to the topof the chlorine dioxide generation process. In the new process, ClCO/sub2/ replaces 70% of the chlorine in the first stage, with 100% substitutiona goal. In addition to eliminating the chlorine, other benefits includean increase in pulp production, a nominal increase in pulp strength,lower production costs, and an economic incentive to harvest the area'smixed-wood stands.</TEXT></DOC>
