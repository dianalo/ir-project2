Rep. Fred Blair, a Democrat, said he asked Gov. Bill Clements toallow legislators to repeal the law during a special session thatends July 19.   ``I think the need at this time is to repeal the bill because ofwhat is going on now and because of the future misapplication of thebill,'' said Blair.   The law, which went into effect June 14 and is thought to be thefirst of its kind in the nation, allows police, fire and otheragencies to withhold felony victims' names, addresses or otherinformation that could lead to their identification.   Previously, police reports were open to the public.   Sponsors of the law said they meant to protect crime victims fromsales pitches by security and alarm companies and that their intentwas misinterpreted.   Now, the news media in some cities cannot get routine crimeinformation, such as the names of people killed in drunken-drivingaccidents. State troopers have been instructed to withhold suchinformation.   Amid calls from legislators to amend the law, the Odessa Americannewspaper Wednesday left a blank space where its police blotter goes.   ``It's absurd,'' M. Olaf Frandsen, managing editor of The OdessaAmerican, wrote. ``You no longer are entitled to know if a burglaris working your neighborhood, or if an acquaintance or relative hasbeen traumatized by a criminal and could use your help.''   Odessa police have sealed arrest reports, though the Ector Countysheriff hasn't changed his release policy, Frandsen said.   Rebecca Daugherty of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of thePress in Washington said a scan of the agency's records showed noother state has enacted a law summarily closing victim informationto the public.   State Sens. Kent Caperton and Cyndi Krier said they will ask Gov.Bill Clements to put the issue on the special session agenda.   ``We need to repeal the harm that is done by this bill,'' saidCaperton. It ``just slipped through.''   Clements said Wednesday he was surprised by the reaction and howthe bill has been interpreted. When he signed it, the governor saidhe thought ``certain victims would be reasonably protected ... but Ididn't think that the records would be put in seclusion, so tospeak.''   Blair and Sen. John Leedom said they sponsored the bill for theDallas Police Department, which has had voluminous requests bysecurity companies for crime reports that can help them make sales.   Texas Media, a freedom of information lobby composed of severalstatewide news associations, is discussing how to respond to the law.   In Fort Worth, Police Chief Thomas Windham said he doesn't likethe law but his department would be risking a lawsuit if it did notstrictly follow it. Police will not be able to tell the public abouthomicide victims, or even newsworthy crimes of a less seriousnature, the chief said.   ``If the mayor's car gets stolen _ like it did a while back _ wewouldn't be able to make that a news story,'' he said. ``It sureplaces us in a tremendous confused state over here.''</TEXT></DOC>
