The necessity to work out nonlinear parameters of correlationof crack propagation rates at high temperatures alongside with the useof fracture linear-elastic mechanics parameters is pointed out. The importanceof metallographic researches when studying fracture processes for thecomprehension of crack formation and propagation mechanisms on microscopiclevel is emphasized. The role of microstructure is illustrated usingas an example type 316 steel. 143 refs.; 34 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
