He said the ``unprecedented'' Iraqi offensive, in which villageshave been burned to the ground, was launched Monday all across the4,000 square miles of Kurdish-held Iraqi territory.   ``The army is deploying at least 60,000 troops, with tanks,aircraft, helicopter gunships, artillery and chemical weapons,'' hesaid. ``The army is burning down villages and killing people onsight and leaving carnage behind.'' The official, based in a WestEuropean capital, spoke on condition of anonymity for ``securityreasons.''   There was no way to confirm the report independently. ButKurdish guerrilla groups have been bracing for an all-out Iraqioffensive for several weeks.   The spokesman said casualty reports were sketchy because radiocontact with the Kurdish stronghold south of the Turkish border wasdifficult.   But he said Kurdish guerrillas destroyed Iraq's 66th specialforces brigade, killing at least 400 men in the mountainous Sidikanregion on Monday.   He said 54 guerrillas and more than 100 Kurdish civilians werekilled and that the Iraqis suffered ``heavy losses.''   The official said the Iraqi forces comprised the northern-based1st and 5th army corps reinforced with units of the elitePresidential Guard, special forces and the 7th army corps normallybased in the south.   He said the Kurds had about 15,000 guerrillas backed by about30,000 reservists.   Diplomats in Baghdad said Iraq has taken advantage of the Aug.20 cease-fire in the eight-year war with Iran to intensifyoperations against the Kurds, who seek autonomy and who sided withthe Iranians.   Turkey, which is fighting its own Kurdish rebels, has allowedcivilians fleeing the fighting into its territory on humanitariangrounds after appeals from Kurdish Democratic Party leader MassoudBarzani, officials in Ankara said today.   The party spokesman said Turkey has announced that it willaccept 30,000 refugees and that ``several thousand'' already havecrossed into Turkey.   He said the brunt of the Iraqi assault was aimed at rebelstrongholds in Zakho, Dahok, Mosul and Erbil provinces.   Iraqi jets dropped poison gas bombs, outlawed under a 1925Geneva treaty, on villages and guerrilla positions in the Zakhoregion Monday and Tuesday, he said.   It was not immediately known how many died from the gas attacks.But Barzani said 500 people were killed and 3,000 wounded inchemical attacks this month in the buildup to the offensive.   The spokesman said: ``We have no gas masks, protective clothing,or antidotes for the chemical weapons. It's causing panic among thepopulation.''   About 20 million Kurds live in the mountains where the Turkish,Iraqi and Iranian borders meet. Syria and the Soviet Union alsohave Kurdish enclaves.   Iraq's 3.5 million Kurds have waged a sporadic war for anautonomous homeland for 50 years.   Sources in Baghdad said Nuzhei Kandemir, undersecratry ofTurkey's Foreign Ministry, flew to the Iraqi capital Monday andcomplained about the use of chemical weapons on the Turkish border.   Kurdish and Iranian officials said more than 50 villages werehit by gas attacks in recent weeks.   Iraq has admitted using chemical weapons during the war withIran, but said Iran used them first. Tehran denied that. The U.N.Security Council has blamed Iraq for gas attacks on Iran severaltimes.   The Kurds said 5,000 of their civilians were killed in March ingas attacks on Halabja, when it was captured by rebels aided byIranian fighters.   Foreign reporters taken to Halabja by the Iranians saw thebodies of hundreds of men, women and children sprawled around thetown, unmarked by shrapnel or bullet wounds.</TEXT></DOC>
