The report by Japan's Economic Planning Agency was the latest ina string of reports on the island nation's growing wealth. Forexample, the Tokyo Stock Exchange has become the world's largest,and most of the world's largest banks are Japanese.   The agency said Japan's per-capita gross national product _ theoutput of goods and services for each member of the population _reached the equivalent of $19,642 in 1987, compared with $18,403 inthe United States.   Japan's ascendance was made possible partly by a strong 4.2percent increase in its total gross national product. Moreimportant, though, was a 17 percent rise in the value of theJapanese yen vs. the dollar from one year to the next.   When the yen is strong, it makes Japan's economic output morevaluable in terms of dollars. It also increases Japan's financialmuscle in the United States and other markets.   ``As an economic power, the United States has already beensurpassed,'' Ezra Vogel, a Harvard University expert in East Asianaffairs, said in reaction to the report.   ``The critical question is who has the leverage, who has thestrategy, who has the critical assets that influence the course ofworld economic development,'' Vogel said.   ``The key people who are able to make new loans are theJapanese. People begin to look to the rules of the game as thelender defines it,'' he said.   ``Unfortunately, it's continuing to happen,'' he added. ``Japanis continuing to collect more chips and the United States iscontinuing to lose chips.''   The report drew a different reaction from Japanese observers,who contended it gives an unrealistic picture because it is basedon what they regard as an overvaluation of the Japanese yen vs. thedollar.   ``It's kind of magic _ numerical magic. It has no sense in reallife,'' said Yoshihisa Kitai, the economist in the New York officeof the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan.   Japan has indeed grown wealthier, but the Japanese people stillfeel poor when they compare their buying power with that ofAmericans, Kitai said. Land costs are high because ofoverprotection of farmland, and an inefficient distribution systemkeeps retail prices high, he said.   In 1986, when calculations were based on $1 trading at 168.51yen, the U.S. gross national product per capita was $17,464 andJapan's was $16,330. In 1987, the calculations were based on $1 for144.62 yen. The dollar currently is trading at about 127 yen.   It is difficult to tell what nation has the highest grossnational product per capita because of drastic fluctuations fromyear to year caused by exchange-rate shifts and the rise and fallof oil prices.   The United Arab Emirates was the world's leader in 1985 at$19,120 per capita, followed by the Sultanate of Brunei at $17,580,the United States at $16,400 and Switzerland at $16,380, accordingto World Bank Atlas 1987. Japan ranked well back at $11,330, theatlas said.   Although more recent numbers are not available, it is known thatthe oil-producing nations have fallen in rank because of lower oilprices, while Western Europe and Japan have risen because ofstronger currencies.   Japan had about 122 million people as of the middle of lastyear, half of the United States' 244 million. But its economicoutput is more than half that of the United States.   Japan's inflation-adjusted GNP growth of 4.2 percent in thecalendar year 1987 was up from 2.4 percent the previous year,helped by gains in housing and industrial equipment investment.   The Economic Planning Agency said Japan's GNP grew by aninflation-adjusted 1.7 percent in the October-December quarter fromthe July-September quarter.   The agency said the government's target of 3.7 percent growthfor fiscal 1987, which ends March 31, was in reach.   The original target was 3.5 percent, but it was revised upwardin December based on signs of an encouraging recovery in themanufacturing sector. Manufacturing earlier had been slumpingbecause of the yen's rise, which makes Japanese products moreexpensive and less competitive abroad.</TEXT></DOC>
