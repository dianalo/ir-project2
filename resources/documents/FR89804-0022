Discussion of Amendment</ITAG>By letter dated June 9, 1987, OSMRE notified Kentucky of State regulationsthat must be amended to be consistent with revised Federal regulations.OSMRE's letter, pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17, identified 5 changes neededin the Kentucky regulatory program for cultural and historic resources.In responses to the OSMRE letter Kentucky submitted on December 21, 1988,(Administrative Record No. KY-841) proposed program amendments to the culturaland historic resource regulations contained in the Kentucky program. OnJanuary 24, 1989, (54 FR 3493), OSMRE announced receipt of the proposedamendment and the procedures for public comment period and a public hearing.No public hearing was requested and none was held. On February 28, 1989,the comment period was closed.By letter dated July 5, 1989, (Administrative Record No. KY-903), Kentuckyre-submitted to OSMRE a proposed amendment on cultural and historic resources.This amendment supersedes the December 21, 1988, proposed amendment submittal.The proposed amendments modify portions of the Kentucky AdministrativeRegulations (KAR) Title 405 Chapters 8 and 24. Specifically, the proposedamendments revise 405 KAR 8:010 by including information on the natureand location of archaeological resources on public and Indian lands asconfidential information, and by adding a requirement for a new writtenfindings by the Cabinet relating to properties listed or eligible for listingon the National Register of Historic Places. The proposed amendments revise405 KAR 8:020 to require the inclusion of information on cultural, historic,and known archaeological resources in the narrative description of eachexploration and reclamation operations plan. The proposed amendments revisethe permits requirements at 405 KAR 8:030 and 405 KAR 8:040 to specifythat Kentucky may require the applicant to identify and evaluate importanthistoric and archaeological resources. In addition, the proposed regulationsrequire that each plan contain a description of measures to be used toprevent adverse impacts to public parks or places listed on the NationalRegister of Historic Places and allows the Cabinet to require the applicantto utilize appropriate mitigation and treatment measures. The proposedamendments also revise the Kentucky Regulations at 405 KAR 24:040 to permitthe relocation of cemeteries if authorized by applicable State law or regulations.Also, the amendment contains pursuant to 30 CFR 731.14(g)(17) a Memorandumof Agreement (MOA) between the SHPO and NREPC.

Compliance With the National Environmental Policy Act The Secretary had determined that, pursuant to section 702(d) of SMCRA,30 U.S.C. 1292(d), no environmental impact statement need be prepared onthis rulemaking.2. Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. On July 12, 1984, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) granted OSMREand exemption from sections 3, 4, 7 and 8 of Executive Order 12291 foractions directly related to approval or conditional approval of State regulatoryprograms. Therefore, this action is exempt from preparation of a RegulatoryImpact Analysis and regulatory review by OMB. The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not havea significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entitiesunder the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>). This rule will not impose any new requirements; rather,it will ensure that existing requirements established by SMCRA and theFederal rules will be met by the State.3. Paperwork Reduction Act This rule does not contain information collection requirements which requireapproval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subject in 30 CFR Part 917 </ITAG>Coal mining, Intergovernmental relations, Surface mining, Underground mining.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 21, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Carl C.
