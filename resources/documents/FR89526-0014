Background</ITAG>On May 18, 1982 the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved theKentucky program. Information pertinent to the general background, revisions,modifications, and amendments to the proposed permanent program submission,as well as the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments and adetailed explanation of the conditions of approval can be found in theMay 18, 1982, <T4>Federal Register </T4>(47 FR 21404-21435). Subsequent actions concerningthe conditions of approval and program amendments are identified at 30CFR 917.11, 917.15, 917.16, and 917.17.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Discussion of Amendment</ITAG>By letter dated July 29, 1986, (Administrative Record No. KY-717), Kentuckysubmitted proposed regulations to implement Senate Bill No. 374. Theseregulations were intended to address the requirement at 30 CFR 917.16(c)(2)which states that Kentucky is required, prior to implementation of SenateBill No. 374, to submit proposed regulations to the Director and to receivethe Director's approval. On November 26, 1986, OSMRE announced (51 FR 42267),that Kentucky had withdrawn the proposed regulations.On August 4, 1987, (Administrative Record No. KY-751), Kentucky resubmittedto OSMRE, pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17, a proposed amendment on remining.On September 16, 1987, (52 FR 34932-34933), OSMRE announced receipt ofthe resubmitted proposed amendment and procedures for a public commentperiod and a public hearing (Administrative Record No. KY-762). Numerouscomments were received on the substance of the proposed amendment priorto the close of the public comment on October 16, 1987. No public hearingwas requested and none was held.On January 14, 1988, a meeting was held between OSMRE and the KentuckyDepartment for Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (DSMRE) to discussthe comments received and to further clarify the proposed amendments.By letter dated January 22, 1988, (Administrative Record No. KY-789), OSMREinformed Kentucky that the proposed amendment was less effective than theFederal regulations and could not be approved. On November 22, 1988, (AdministrativeRecord No. KY-840), Kentucky informally submitted revised regulations onremining. In a letter dated January 12, 1989, (Administrative Record No.KY-843), OSMRE found the informal submittal to contain regulations lesseffective than the Federal regulations. On February 28, 1989, (AdministrativeRecord No. KY-855), Kentucky withdrew the August 4, 1987, proposed amendmenton remining.On April 24, 1989, (Administrative Record No. KY-879), Kentucky resubmittedregulations to implement Senate Bill No. 374. This proposed amendment modifiessections of the Kentucky Administrative Regulations (KAR) at 405 KAR 8:060,and 405 KAR 20:090 as summarized below.1. Kentucky proposes to add a new regulation 405 KAR 8:060 to set forthpermit application requirements for special reclamation of abandoned minelands. Special reclamation permits are for remining previously mined landsand for secondary coal recovery operations. The proposed rule includessections on applicability, definitions; general provisions; environmentalresources information; maps, drawings and cross-sections; and mining andreclamation plans.2. Kentucky proposes to add a new regulation, 405 KAR 20:090, to establishperformance standards to apply to special reclamation permits. The applicabilitysection of the rule proposes that requirements of 405 KAR Chapters 16,18, and 20 (the approved program performance standards for surface mines,underground mines, and special categories) would not apply to such landsexcept as specifically stated in the rule. The rule establishes hydrologicprotection requirements, requirements for backfilling and grading, andrevegetation standards for special reclamation permits.<ITAG tagnum="84">III.
