(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Expert systems are like idiots savants.andP;  Like Dustin Hoffman's character inthe film Rain Man, they have exceptionalability in only one area, the taskthey're built for But that's the secret of their success.andP;  In fact expertsystems are the most commercially viable part of the mulfifaceted field ofartifical intelligence (Al).andM;Expert systems first proved their practical power at Stanford University inthe early '70s with MYCIN, a program that provided advice on bacterial bloodinfections and meningitis to physicians who weren't experts in hematology andneurology.andP;  MYCIN was viable but not as a generalpurpose savant.andP;  It couldexplain why it required information and how it drew a conclusion, but itcould make a diagnosis only after precise input and it was accurate only 65percent of the time.andP;  (if that seems low, consider that MYCIN's humancounterparts accurately prescribed treatment only 42.5 to 62.5 percent of thetime.andP;  Idiots savants indeed.)andM;Expert systems are decision-making tools.andP;  They capture knowledge from humanexperts and make it available quickly and accurately.andP;  But expert systemsdon't provide black-and-white answers as tax-deduction programs do.andP;  Theiranswers are good rather than perfect.andP;  That's because expert systems manageexpertise.andP;  When we speak of data repositories on computers, we call themdatabases.andP;  But data is only a small part of a business equation.andP;  A humanbeing must look over the data to identify meaningful patterns - using aunique ability we identify as intelligence.andP;  AI researchers hope to capturethat intelligence one day, but in the meantime, in Me limited areas in whichexpert systems are applied, they have made tremendous progress.andP;  In manycases, expect systems perform more consistently and more quickly than theirhuman counterparts,andM;Expert systems are currently in use in a wide range of business areas.andO;BehaviorTech, for example, has developed an expert system called Exemplar tohelp reinforce learning in training situations.andP;  Federal Express moves yourovernight deliveries through rapid and complex trails by means ofinventory-control and customer-service expert systems.andP;  At Motorola, home ofthe microprocessor that powers your Mac, an expert system called Helpdeskwalks customer-service representatives through service-request calls and thenguides callers through hardware and software solutions for the computers itis programmed to offer advice on.andP;  In the financial arena, Peat Marwick Mainandamp; Co.andP;  has developed another expert system, Loan Probe, to evaluate loanapplications.andM;If expert systems can serve in such important roles, then why do manymanagement-information-system (MIS) directors continue to deride them? Thefirst reason is political: In many cases, an expert system is a grass-rootseffort that travels paths outside traditional MIS development procedures,threatening the MIS &quot;priesthood.andP;  &quot; The second reason is technicalExpert-system technology is difficult to introduce when you're up to yourneck in broken-down FORTRAN code and inundated with requests to enhanceexisting manufacturing, accounting, and engineering systems.andM;The technical issues should be easier to deal with than the political ones.andO;Expert systems are not that complex if they are programmed well.andP;  When MeMYCIN experiments were over, Stanford researchers realized they had done somefundamental research on a new class of programs.andP;  By stripping out the expertknowledge on blood from MYCIN, they retained the shell of the program.andP;  Todaywe continue to call expertsystem programming packages shells.andM;A dozen expert-system shells are now available for the Macintosh.andP;  We providesome quick takes on them here.andP;  Newcomers to the field can take a detour no wto get some basics on the structure of such shells by reading the 'Anatomy ofan Expert-System Shell&quot; sidebar Those who are already familiar with expertsystems should stay in line to read about Nexpert Object one of the hottestexpert systems on the Mac.andM;Navigating with Nexpert ObjectandM;As the glow of Mac II screens cascade s over cubicles that seem ripped fromthe side of a Sherman tank, Neuron Data engineers are honing one of the mostinnovative programs on the Macintosh.andP;  Nexpert Object, a $5,000 hybridexpert-system shell, may seem esoteric and costly for the practicalMacintosh, but this AI tool, with its sophisticated interface, is far fromesoteric.andP;  With ail estimated 40 percent of the high-end expertsystem market,Nexpert Object competes with LISP-based tools such as IntelliCorp's KEE,Inference's ART, and Carnegie Group's Knowledge Craft.andP;  All of these systemsare hybrids, mixing the traditional AI world of logical declarations withtheexpressiveness of intelligent object-oriented programming, but theyrequire $35,000-to$200,000 LISP machines, plus $10,000 to $50,000 insoftware.andP;  No wonder such systems Have been branded esoteric.andM;Nexpert functions on a Mac Plus with I megabyte of RAM for the comparativelylow startup cost of $5,000.andP;  And with the exception of custom interfaces,Nexpert systems developed on the Macintosh are fully transportable to IBMPCs; Apollo, Sun, and HewlettPackard workstations; VAX millicomputers; andIBM mainframes another key reason for its market share.andM;Lower-priced and less-capable expert systems such as MacSmarts,Instant-Expert Plus, and Level5/ Macintosh are excellent products for smallstand-alone applications.andP;  Many of these shells can be linked to HyperCard orExcel, but they lack the richness of the Nexpert Object environment.andO;Nexpert's ability to act as an embedded logic engine in computer-aided-design(CAD) software or gather information from mainframe databases puts it in aclass above its entry-level cousins.andM;The Structure of Nexpert ObjectandM;Developing systems in Nexpert is a pleasure.andP;  Nexpert's hybrid designcombines rules for inferencing and control with objects for representingthings and ideas (see Figure 1).andP;  A highly graphical interface provideseditors for rules, objects, classes, and other Nexpert elements.andP;  Nexpert'sediting environment makes extensive use of pop-up menus to help simplifyentry and save keystrokes associated with commands.andP;  Systems such as OPS5 andLevel5iMac intosh, on the other hand, restrict developers to text editorsduring development.andP;  OPS5 works iii the LISP environment, so its rules becomeavailable after entry, but syntax checking is nonexistent.andP;  Level5/Macintoshuses a compileand-run method that checks syntax when it is compiled, so itsrules are not available until a successful compile is completed, WithNexpert, rule syntax is checked rule by rule after the OK button is clicked.andO;Once the rule is entered in the editor, it becomes an active member of thecurrent knowledge base.andP;  Objects, classes, and other elements are alsoincrementally compiled.andM;With OPS5, graphic representations of rules are impossible unless you writeyour own LISP code or travel to expensive OPS5 environments such as ART orKnowledge Craft.andP;  And Level5/Macintosh provides only a simple anddifficult-toread rule tree.andP;  With Nexpert, network windows visually describethe relationships between rules and objects in a knowledge base (see Figures2 and 3).andP;  These networks are not snapshots in time but living documentsupdated during a Nexpert consultation that illustrate what rules have been&quot;fired,&quot; the direction Nexpert is heading, and what objects and classes havebeen affected by the session.andM;The editors make Nexpert easy to use, but it's the inference engine thatgives Nexpert Object its reasoning power.andP;  Nexpert's primary inferencemethodology is called opportunistic reasoning.andP;  In most expert systems,designers must choose between a forward- or backward-inferencing engine.andO;Backward-chaining systems such as Leve15/Macintosh begin their inference witha conclusion, such as &quot;My picture tube is blown.&quot; The inference engine thengoes backward through the knowledge base, trying to confirm or deny thestatement.andP;  Most diagnostic systems are backward chaining in nature.andO;Forwardchaining systems, such as Charles Forgey's OPS5 algorithm, take dataas input and then search for rules that use this data and try to determinewhat advice to provide.andM;Nexpert Object combines these two methods so designers can create expertsystems that more precisely emulate the human expert.andP;  If you enter Mypicture tube is blown into Nexpert and it proves to be false, Nexpert mayrecommend &quot;Fix the color PC board&quot; because during its attempt to confirm thatthe picture tube was blown, it found that the color PC board was the problem.andO;Nexpert's choice of inference methods depends on static and dynamicstrategies that the designer controls.andP;  Static strategies globally controlwhat type of information is placed in the knowledge queue.andP;  They can bechanged by rules and objects to engage or disengage several fact-forwardingmechanisms, such as forward chaining on false rules or explicit actionsdescribed in a rule or object.andP;  Several tools, including Current Rule,Current Hypothesis, Transcript, and Full Report windows, give developersinsight into Nexpert's reasoning methods.andP;  A skilled Nexpert developer canalso use the Rule Network to watch the progression of newly programmed setsof inferences.andM;Working through a problem serially, however, is not what makes an expert anexpert.andP;  The capacity to adapt is what's important.andP;  Like human experts,Nexpert Object has the ability to rethink a problem as situations change.andO;This ability, known as nonmonotonic reasoning, allows facts to be forgottenand beliefs to be revised, based on the condition of a model.andP;  If Changeslots in Nexpert objects are invoked when an object's value is changed.andO;These slots enable nonmonotonic reasoning because they're the first to detecta change in the surroundings.andM;LISP-based products such as ART and KEE allow designers to drop into the LISPprogramming language to modify the expert-system environment.andP;  AlthoughNexpert does not have interactive language extensions as LISP shells do,Nexpert's open interface accommodates programs or specific functions writtenin C or Pascal.andP;  In an expert system for manufacturing, for example, it couldincotporate a C routine that performed mathematical visualization functionsthat would be difficult, if not impossible, in the Nexpert environment.andM;For many users, outside programs may hold little interest, but outsidedatabases are a key concern.andP;  Nexpert's ability to integrate with databasesfar surpasses that of any tool in its price range.andP;  Nexpert can communicatewith SYLK spreadsheet/database files, Excel files saved in Lotus 1-2-3format, or Oracle through Struc tured Query Language (SQL).andP;  With the CL/1connectivity language, Nexpert can retrieve records from mainframe andminicomputer SQL databases.andM;No ObjectionsandM;Creating objects is Nexpert's way of representing the world.andP;  You can easilyrepresent a coffee table or the philosophical gleanings of Rabbi Moses BenMaimon as a Nexpert object.andP;  Nexpert's abundant object base consists ofclasses, subclasses, objects, subobjects, and properties.andP;  No other expertsystem running on a standard Mac has the object-creation and inheritancetalents of Nexpert Object,andM;The highest level of object abstraction in Nexpert is the class.andP;  A class inNexpert is similar to a class in taxonomy.andP;  All members of a class havecertain things in common, although there may be local variations.andP;  Say youhave a class of all tables.andP;  The class has several properties related to it,such as color, number of legs, and style.andP;  The local variations can besubclasses or objects.andP;  Subclasses are fine-tunings of the class.andP;  A subclassof tables might include all countryFrench tables, all modem tables, or allsixth-century-B.C.andP;  dirt tables of Gondwannaland.andM;Class and object properties not only store values but also have controlmechanisms that they use during an inference session.andP;  These controlmechanisms are called meta-slots.andP;  When an object, such as a table, is linkedto a class, it inherits properties and meta-slots.andP;  The washed-pinecountry-French table that resides in my living room is an instance of thetable class.andP;  This particular countryFrench table, when represented in anexpert system, inherits the properties of color, number of legs, and stylefrom the table class.andM;Inheritance in Nexpert does not occur in one direction only.andP;  The ability toinherit values from &quot;children&quot; is one of Nexpert's important differences fromother object systems.andP;  Called upward inheritance, this ability can be appliedin the design when several objects suggest a class after they are entered.andP;  Avalue such as the color might be inherited by a &quot;parent&quot; object called tableif the color of the legs is always deteimined first.andP;  Nexpert's inheritanceschemes can be fully controlled with rules and meta-slots.andM;Every Nexpert object or class that is born without a property isautomatically given a property called value, which is a generic property thatis used in objects that have no definition and cannot be inherited.andP;  Such anobject with no parent or child objects is called a flat object.andP;  Propertiesin Nexpert, like classes, do not hold information themselves; they are onlydefinitions.andP;  The property hypo might be created for all hypotheses.andP;  Thisproperty resides in the system as a simple Boolean description until it isattached to an object in the following way: Determine Windows Covering.hypo,at which time it can receive a TRUE, FALSE, or NOTKNOWN value.andM;Meta-slots are Neuron Data's implementation of classic AI methods calleddemons, which are suspended processes that wait for a particular kind ofevent to occur.andP;  When it does, they automatically perform their job andeither terminate or suspend themselves, waiting for the next event.andP;  Youaccess meta-slots by clicking on the meta-slot box ill the object editor orby calling the metaslot editor from the Edit menu.andP;  All demons are stored inthe If Change or Order of Sources slots of the properties.andP;  An If Change slotis invoked only when the value of a slot changes.andP;  Order of Sources slotsdetermine where an object will look for its value.andM;Immediately after the value of an object property changes, the If Change slotis invoked.andP;  The If Change slots connected with properties can assign valuesthrough LET and DO; force backward chaining by invoking a rule's hypothesiswith DO; reset rules, objects, or strategies through Reset and Strategies; orperform 11 other Nexpert functions.andP;  If Change slots are very important toreal-time expert systems that monitor operations.andP;  If the voltage aninstrument measures changes from 50 to 60 volts, that condition may require acompletely new look at the world.andP;  By writing an If Change slot thatevaluates the value of a voltage every time it changes, Nexpert can alwaysprocess the best rules for its current situation.andP;  The If Change slots areexecuted sequentially until all functions have been performed.andM;The Order of Sources slot is also in the meta-slot editor, and it tells aNexpert property how to obtain a value.andP;  Default values can be establishedwith InitValue.andP;  DO and LET assign values, and inheritance operators modifythe object so values can either be obtained from parent objects/classes,child objects/classes, or sibling objects/classes or be turned off so noinheritance takes place.andP;  If nothing is entered into the Order of Sourcesslot, the system first looks backward for rules that will establish a valueand then at inheritance from parent objects.andP;  If upward inheritance isestablished, it will try to inherit from child objects.andP;  When Nexpert cannotestablish a value within itself, it asks the user for the answer.andP;  Order ofSources ceases to be active when Nexpert finds an answer.andM;Nexpert's default question reads something like &quot;What is the value of .andP;  .  .andO;.&quot;With the meta-slot prompt line, you can write questions that give yourquery more precision.andP;  Using the @V function in the prompt, you can addvariables to the question for clarity.andP;  The ability to add values in theprompt line, also found in Level5/ Macintosh, is an important interfacedesigntool for portability.andP;  Both Nexpert and Level5/Macintosh run on severalplatforms, and custom interfaces are often too costly to develop.andP;  By usingvalues from the knowledge base in question, you are able to create amore-custom-looking delivery environment.andM;Nexpert objects are also important links to the outside world.andP;  With theirability to call external routines and map to databases, they can bridge theinformation available in common applications such as AEC Information Manager,Excel, FileMaker II, and Double Helix.andP;  When the selected information is readinto Nexpert, each record becomes a dynamic object that inherits propertiesfrom a class.andP;  If you were retrieving a table description from a database ofinterior design, you would map database fields toobject properties.andO;Meta-slots from the class are also inherited by the dynamic objects.andP;  Nexpenturns information about real-world objects into dynamic representations thatact not only as repositories but also as changing and reasoning entities.andM;Much of Nexpert's power comes from its ability to create and interact withdynamic objects.andP;  Dynamic objects differ from static objects in that theydisappear when you restart an inference; static objects are a fixed pan ofyour knowledge base that you must delete to remove.andP;  By capitalizing onNexpert's facility with dynamic objects, you can create virtual factories inwhich parts interact and combine to become assemblies, schedules changebecause an object is not available, and random failure is introduced by rulesto add shadows to the idyllic silicon and electronic workplace.andM;Ruling the RoostandM;We spend our entire lives trying to break rules, but rules are what we learnin school and on the job, and they're the knowledge we pass on to others.andP;  Avirtual factory can be thought of as a set of things in an actual factorythat are controlled by rules that govern how they behave.andP;  Processes andlogic in Nexpert Object are built with rules.andP;  Rules in most expert-systemshells are composed of English words arranged in IF/ THEN statements.andO;Nexpert Object augments the IF/THEN rule with the IF/THEN/DO format, whichallows Nexpert to incorporate many complex structures such as rule-modifiedinferencing and creation of new object collections.andM;Nexpert's rules are a bundle of objects categorized as conditionalstatements, a hypothesis, and actions, all displayed in the rule editor (seeFigure 4).andP;  Its rules also contain various control fields that help resolveconflicts between two rules that otherwise seem equally valid.andP;  On theleft-hand side (LHS) of the rule editor are the conditions, the set of itemsthat must be satisfied before a hypothesis is true.andP;  If a hypothesis is true,Nexpert processes the right-hand side (RHS) of the rule, or actions.andP;  Here isan example of a rule:andM;IFandM;YES The sky is cloudy andandM;NO I do not possessandM;an - umbrellaandM;THEN I should haveandM;an umbrellaandM;EXECUTE Robotic umbrellaandM;bringer routineandM;The YES and NO statements are Boolean conditions, the THEN statement is thehypothesis, and the EXECUTE statement is an action.andP;  The Nexpert Objectlanguage is rich and diverse.andP;  All the terms are easily accessible throughpop-up windows.andP;  It is impossible to forget what reserved words areavailable, but their syntax ' is a bit tricky.andM;Conditional statements can use I of 19 reserved words to compare what theexpert system is told against what it is looking for.andP;  Boolean YES and NOtest black-and-white answers.andP;  Since a hypothesis is a Boolean object, YESand NO are very important in structuring a knowledge base.andM;A hypothesis in a condition of a rule forces Nexpert to backwardchain to thereferenced rule and prove it before proceeding.andP;  This type of linkage iscalled a strong link.andP;  Nexpen rules can also be weakly linked through aContext.andP;  The Context lists a group of hypotheses that the system mustexamine before ending a consultation, even if the hypotheses do not haveanything in common.andP;  Contexts can be used to group loosely organized itemssuch as a series of checklists.andM;The symbols andgt;, andless;, andless;andgt;, =, andgt;=, and andless;= test numeric values.andP;  Numeric values inNexpert can be numbers entered by a user or can be calculations performedwithin the rules.andP;  Equal and NotEqual are for comparing variables with eachother.andP;  If Door.color and Frame.color both have the value blue, they areequal.andP;  IS and ISNOT test for string variables or keywords.andP;  You can use ISto test IS TODAY &quot;Tuesday.&quot; IS and ISNOT can also test internal values ofNexpert, such as the state of a hypothesis.andP;  This type of rule might bewritten as is HypothesisX KNOWN.andM;Name and Show are nottests but assigment operators.andP;  Name sets a variable toa given value, and Show displays a text file or PICT or MacPaint picture tohelp the user through the question.andP;  Name is also for passing messagesbetween objects.andP;  An action such as Name Door.color Frame.color passes thecurrent value of Door.color to the Frame.color slot.andM;Manipulating lists is very important in AI applications and makes Nexpert anexcellent database front end.andP;  The Member and NotMember operators are used tocheck the elements of a list.andP;  Nexpert's patternmatching capabilities allowlists of objects to be created from the examination of a class or group ofobjects.andP;  Existential pattern matching might test to see if any draperies instock are paisley, and Universal pattern matching might verify that all itemsof a checklist are completed.andM;The final part of a rule is called an action.andP;  Actions can perform 1 2functions.andP;  With actions, you can assign variable values with DO and LET.andO;You can reset rules and other Nexpert elements.andP;  Resetting, for example, isused to make Nexpert forget that it knew something.andP;  When the weather changesfrom sunny to rainy, you might reset items in a traffic-control expert systemsuch as number of intersection patrol persons and issue raincoats.andP;  Createand Delete Object are used in Nexpert to create new groups of objects or todelete objects that are no longer useful.andP;  If pattern matching has honed downa list of eligible cars for a purchaser, Create Object can be used to linkthat list to a new class called eligible-cars.andP;  The Execute operator callsexternal routines that enhance the data-processing capabilities of Nexpert.andO;Show displays PICT and MacPaint graphics.andP;  Retrieve and Write are used indatabase functions.andM;The LoadKB (where KB stands for knowledge base) and UnloadKB operators arefor dynamic management of knowledge bases.andP;  After your initial session withan accountant, the accountant's expert system might unload its preliminaryknowledge base and load either the longform or short-form knowledge base.andO;Knowledge-base loading and unloading is an excellent opportunity to useNexpert's interpreted statements.andP;  When you put backslashes around an object,the object becomes generic.andP;  An interpreted statement such as \filename\ canbe set with LET to the name 1040short or 1040long.andP;  This way the same rulecan be used for both conditions.andM;Nexpert's rule language is full of intricacies and possibilities.andP;  It is notsomething you will master over a cup of coffee and a doughnut.andP;  But onceyou've mastered it, you can transform your Macintosh into a reasoningmachine.andP;  Level5 offers simple rules with mathematical capabilities, butNexpert's inter-play of objects and rules offers infinitely morepossibilities than Level5 does.andP;  And although OPS5 is blessed with excellentpattern-matching skills, its arcane LISP-based architecture anddifficult-to-master syntax make it undesirable unless you are willing to makeconsultants a permanent fixture of your operation.andP;  With patience, mostcomputer-literate people will easily acclimate to the Nexpert Objectrule-editing environment, with its visual webs and watchful debugging tools.andM;At the Frontiers of KnowledgeandM;Although Nexpert is an excellent companion for knowledge engineering, it isnot without deficiencies: My training required the excellent classes of theBechtel AI Institute, contracted by Neuron Data.andP;  Nexpert is an involvedproduct to learn, and its manual is a complex document to read.andP;  Now that Iknow the basics, I use the manual as a reference for its finer points.andP;  Newusers, however, can lose their way quickly in its maze of cross-referencesand allusions.andM;Nexpert is a relatively complete knowledge-engineering tool, but certaintechnical elements, such as multivalued variables and true intelligentobjects, are missing.andP;  There are annoyances such as the inability to cut andpaste between fields because some other platforms, such as UNIX workstations,can't handle this function.andP;  Nexpert also has a frustrating copy-protectionscheme that won't let you make archival copies.andP;  To install Nexpert, youexecute the floppy-disk version and install it on your hard-disk drive, butif you lose your hard-disk drive and get another, you can't use the floppydisk to reinstall the software.andP;  On the PC, Neuron Data uses securityhardware that is equally aggravating.andM;But these flaws are minor compared with the usefulness of the tool.andP;  Thedevelopment environment of Nexpert is an excellent example of what Macintoshapplications need to evolve into.andP;  Notebooks that hold data, objects,classes, or rules can, with a single click of the mouse, become editors.andO;Sprawling overviews of your knowledge base or object representation can befocused for clarity or expanded for context.andP;  Clicking on almost anything inNexpert reveals a pop-up menu that simplires data entry or eliminates thetime-consuming shuffling of windows.andM;Nexpert Object is an elegant product for developing knowledge-based software.andO;Occasional users will complain of complexity when returning to Nexpert afteran absence, because it's a tool that must be used constantly and consistentlyto be learned well.andP;  Nexpert Object is a program racing toward theconvergence of hypertext, databases, and intelligent assistants.andP;  Futureversions of Nexpert will incorporate more features, such as direct links toOracle and HyperCard.andP;  An upcoming module, Nextra, will add a powerful toolfor knowledge acquisition.andP;  And with the release of the Open InterfaceToolbox (OIT), on which Nexpert is built and which enables Nexpert'swell-known portability, Nexpert users and software engineers alike willbenefit from OIT's machine-independent resources.andP;  When that happens, Nexpertwill be a key link in the Mac's ability to adapt to the future, where dataand information are transformed into knowledge.andM;Nexpept Object ****l/2andM;Follows Macintosh Interface 5andM;Printed Documentation 3 1/2andM;On-Screen Help 1andM;Performance 5andM;Consumer Value 4 1/2 Comments: An excellent C-based expert system for theMacintosh.andP;

 MacSmarts' main attribute is itseasy-to-implement hypergraphics interface, The program is ideal for anentry-level system to automate help-desk functions.andP;  MacSmarts Professional,which should be shipping as you read this, adds variables and calculations tothe standard MacSmarts fare.andP;  Cognition Technology, 55 Wheeler St.,andO;Cambridge, MA 02138; (617) 492-0246.andP;  $195.andM;Anatomy of an Expert System ShellandM;Expert-system shells consist of four basic components: knowledge-acquisitiontools, explanation facilities, the system interface, and the inferenceengine.andP;  In combination with the working memory in a computer and a knowledgebase, expert systems can perform their reasoning tasks.andM;In most expert systems, the knowledge-acquisition tools are rule templatesthat act as guidelines for knowledge engineers.andP;  Entering IF/THEN rules abouta particular domain of knowledge builds the knowledge base as each rule isentered.andP;  Nexpert Object, Intelligent Developer, and Instant-Expert work thisway.andP;  Some expert-systems shells, such as Level5, have noknowledge-engineering interface and accept knowledge through standard textfiles.andP;  Programs such as MacSmarts can accept both rules and historical datafor inducing knowledge.andP;  Using an algorithm called ID3, MacSmarts can inducerules from a series of examples entered in a spreadsheet format.andP;  ID3 looksfor patterns in the examples to find rules.andP;  New programs, such as NeuronData's Nextra, are adding sophisticated automated psychological inquirytechniques to the knowledge engineer's arsenal.andM;Having rules alone is like having a ticker tape and nobroker: They're goodtoknow, but you can't do anything with them.andP;  The inference engine of anexpert-system shell is what transforms IF/THEN statements into reasonableconclusions.andP;  Inference engines come in three varieties: forward chaining,backward chaining, and mixed mode.andP;  Forward-chaining expert systems requiredata to go to the expert system first.andP;  As the data is entered, the inferenceengine searches for rules that the data satisfies.andP;  As rules &quot;fire,&quot;newconclusions are arrived at by the inference engine, which drives thesystem closer to a final conclusion.andP;  Forward-chaining systems are ideallysuited to planning and evaluation problems.andP;  Backward-chaining inferenceengines, such as Level5's, are good diagnostic systems.andP;  If you walk intoyour car dealer and say your car has a burned-out taillight, abackward-chaining inference engine will look for the most-likely cause of thetaillight's failure first and then backward-chain deeper into its knowledgebase (perhaps suggesting that fusesand wiring be cheeked) until it confirmsor denies your guess.andP;  Mixed-mode expert systems such as Nexpert Objectcombine these two techniques to better approximate the reasoning of a humanexpert.andM;When experts reason, you rarely need to ask why they arrived at a particularsolution or asked a certain question.andP;  But such questions often come up intraining situations and are required with automation.andP;  During the MYCINexperiments (see main Nexpert article), the Stanford researchers endowedMYCIN with HOW and WHY facilities.andP;  These terms have propagated throughcommercial products.andP;  Asking an expert system HOW it came to a conclusionreveals a trace of the rules that led to its advice.andP;  Asking WHY aquestionisbeing asked tells the expert system to expose its current train ofthought.andM;These three elements, along with the system interface for opening files andprinting reports, combine to create the expert-system environment.andP;  Only afew lines of code are necessary to implement an expert-system inferenceengine.andP;  Much of the code goes into building the interface.andP;  That's becauseAI researchers and corporations want knowledge engineers to concentrate oncreating systems to solve problems, not on entering problems into a system.andM;The Expert Is In  At Koller Partners AG, Nexpert Object, a solid-modelingsystem, and the Oracle database are used to transform design ideas intoproduction documents and machine data about factors such as machining timeand marching costs.andP;  Kollier, like many other manufacturing companies, facesthe problem of keeping its design engineers in touch with manufacturingreality.andP;  Keller's system, CAP-ES (Computer Aided Planning-Expert System),interacts with design engineers to verify that designs are correct.andP;  TheCATIA solid-modeling system is for building detailed views of machined pads.andO;At any point during the designing process, Nexpert can be invoked to checkthe consistency of a design against engineering standards or to verify that apad can actually be manufactured.andP;  Design engineers can also call expedsystemfunctions to obtain accurate estimates of machine time and costs for theincipient part.andM;Nexpert's knowledge-processing skills are also valuable inside factories.andP;  AtPirelli Tires, total quality control means a visual inspection of each tire.andO;As details about defects are brought to thequality manager, hemust makechanges in the manufacturing process to prevent future defects, The qualitymanager often has to choose among several possible solutions to decide whichis most the cost-effective and most important to Implement.andP;  With NexpertObject, two knowledge engineers, two experts, and about six months ofintensive work, Pirelli developed the Total Quality Assistant, or TQA, TQAgathers defect data from the factory, defines repair actions, and computesthe cost of various solutions.andP;  TQA is currently installed in one ofPirelli's Italian tire factories.andM;Nexpert is not limited to factory-floor and manufacturing problems.andP;  At FocusTechnologies, biologists use 18 knowledge bases, the Oracle database, andfour expert systems embedded in C applications to perform laboratory testing,risk analysis, and behavioral counseling for individuals with health risks.andO;Focus is using Nexpert for its expert-system development, but reporting ishandled through publishing software, graphical interfaces are written in C,and Oracle is accessed through an SOL precompiler.andP;  At Focus, Nexpert is anintegral component of a collage approach to systems design that includes thebest products in several categories.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
