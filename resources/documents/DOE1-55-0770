To ascertain the extent and distributionof ischemic alterations in the brains of these small animals, we modifiedthe Sakurada technique to measure regional cerebral blood flow usingcarbon-14 autoradiography. Seven-day-old rats underwent right commoncarotid artery ligation following which they were rendered hypoxic with8% O2 at 37 degrees C. Before and during hypoxia, the rat pups receivedan injection of iodo[{sup 14}C]antipyrine for determination of regionalcerebral blood flow. Blood flows to individual structures of the ipsilateralcerebral hemisphere were not influenced by arterial occlusion alone;flows to the contralateral hemisphere and to the brainstem and cerebellumactually increased by 25-50%. Hypoxia-ischemia was associated with decreasesin regional cerebral blood flow of the ipsilateral hemisphere such thatby 2 hours, flows to subcortical white matter, neocortex, striatum, andthalamus were 15, 17, 34, and 41% of control, respectively. The hierarchyof the blood flow reductions correlated closely with the distributionand extent of ischemic neuronal necrosis. However, unlike the pathologicpattern of this model, the degree of ischemia appeared homogeneous withineach brain region. Blood flows to contralateral cerebral hemisphericstructures were relatively unchanged from prehypoxic values, whereasflows to the brainstem and cerebellum nearly doubled and tripled, respectively.Thus, ischemia is the predominant factor that determines the topographyof tissue injury to major regions of immature rat brain, whereas metabolicfactors may influence the heterogeneous pattern of damage seen withinindividual structures.</TEXT></DOC>
