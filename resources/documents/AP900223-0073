The farmer, Wilhelm Rabe, was fined the equivalent of $40 onFeb. 12 for assaulting Ekati Xaba last year on a farm near theeastern border with Swaziland.   Magistrate J.D. Jacquire accepted evidence that Rabe had beatenXaba with an electric cord, but rejected testimony that the workeralso was thrown to the ground and kicked.   Jacquire said there was no proof that the beating caused thebrain haemmorrhage and ruptured spleen that were blamed for Xaba'sdeath the day after the beating.   Lester Fuchs, a Parliament member for the anti-apartheidDemocratic Party, said the sentence was excessively lenient andcould cause negative publicity for South Africa at a time when thegovernment is promoting racial reconciliation. He asked thatJustice Minister Kobie Coetsee account for the magistrate's ruling.   According to The Sowetan, the country's largest black-orienteddaily newspaper, two people who witnessed the beating had givenstatements to police but were never called to testify in court.   The Sowetan said Xaba's widow and six children were forced toleave the farm after his death and now live in a one-room cardboardshack.   There have been at least two other similar cases in the pastthree years, in which white farmers avoided prison despite beingconvicted of fatal assaults of black employees.   Several blacks convicted of murdering white farmers are on DeathRow, facing hanging if the government lifts a recently declaredmoratorium on executions.</TEXT></DOC>
