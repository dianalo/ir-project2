Garcia</HL><DD> 11/03/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   The stock market broke out of its Monday meltdown syndrome as prices advanced in moderate trading yesterday.    After a brief drop of about 25 points as trading got under way, the Dow Jones Industrial Average reversed course. The average recovered all of its early losses by midday and climbed pretty steadily throughout the rest of the session, ending 20.56 higher at 2014.09.    Two weeks ago yesterday, the stock market crashed as the industrial average suffered its biggest drop ever, 508 points. After a brief recovery that week, the average tumbled nearly 157 points last Monday. But it moved higher during the rest of the week and again yesterday, gaining a total of more than 220 points.    Yesterday's advance went beyond the blue chips, but it wasn't as broad as Friday's move. Yesterday, gainers on the New York Stock Exchange had less than a 2-to-1 lead over losers; Friday, they led by an overwhelming 8-to-1 margin.    Trading activity finally slowed after the surge in the past two weeks. Big Board volume fell to 176 million shares from 303.4 million Friday. It was the slowest day since Oct. 13, when 172.9 million shares changed hands.    &quot;There were moderate activity and moderate price moves. It was almost back to normal,&quot; sighed a weary trader at a New York brokerage firm yesterday.    Despite slightly higher interest rates, utility stocks continued to gain ground. These stocks fared far better than any other group in the stock market last month. Electric utility issues fell only 3.5%, while the industrial average dropped 23.2%. Yesterday, the Dow Jones Utility Average rose 3.32 to 185.87.    Transportation stocks also had a good day, as the Dow Jones Transportation Average moved ahead 27.14 to 784.38. Traders said a possible bid for Santa Fe Southern Pacific from Henley Group stirred up some interest in the rail stocks.    USAir Group and Piedmont Aviation got approval from the government to go ahead with their planned merger. But most airlines stocks also were stronger. One analyst said that the airlines as well as the lodging industry are among the groups now perceived to benefit from a lower dollar and an increased flow of foreign tourists to the U.S.    Institutional investors have also ventured back into the over-the-counter market, said Peter DaPuzzo, senior executive vice president in charge of retail trading at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in New York.    The Nasdaq OTC composite moved up 5.03 to 328.33, but volume fell to 133 million shares from 208.1 million shares. Institutional investors bid up prices on 1,606 issues, while 1,061 issues fell back. Mr. DaPuzzo said that although investors are willing to pay as much as 1/2-point over the last sale for a stock that they want, most aren't willing to chase highflying issues as they did earlier in the year.    Monte Gordon, director of research at Dreyfus Corp., believes the stock market is in the process of adjusting to its stunning and rapid decline from its late-August peak. While he chooses to view the recent crash as just a correction because the stock market has lived with the problems of budget and trade deficits, a lower dollar and greater inflation risk for some years now, he also doesn't see much room for further advances here.    Progress on trimming the budget deficit would help remove some of the uncertainty facing the market now, Mr. Gordon added.    Hopes of a quick and meaningful solution in Washington on the budget question are fading every day, Wall Street professionals said. Yesterday, President Reagan and lawmakers adjourned after a brief session in which little progress on budget cutting was made.    Oil stocks, like utility issues, escaped the horrors of October with less damage than the rest of the market, falling just 14.7%. Yesterday, most of these issues advanced. Exxon rose 1 to 43 5/8; Mobil added 1 3/8 to 41 3/4; Atlantic Richfield moved up 2 1/2 to 80; Royal Dutch added 3/8 to 110 7/8; Texaco gained 1 5/8 to 34 1/4, and Amoco increased 1 5/8 to 72 1/8.    Salomon Brothers' analyst Paul Mlotok expects international oil companies -- Chevron, Exxon, Royal Dutch and Shell Transport -- to outperform the rest of the market in the next six to 12 months. Strong cash flow, high dividends and the chance that earnings can grow more than 10% annually in the next five years are the attractive features he sees in these companies.    Technology stocks were mixed. Unisys lost 1/2 to 33 1/2. The computer maker introduced a line of personal workstations. Digital Equipment added 2 5/8 to 139; Honeywell rose 4 to 62 1/4, and International Business Machines gained 2 to 124 1/2.    Citicorp rose 3/4 to 41 1/4. Citicorp Investment Bank has arranged to assume PaineWebber's commercial paper business, which includes more than 50 major issues. The move will make the bank's commercial paper operation the fifth largest in the U.S.    A PaineWebber spokesman said the move had been under consideration for some time and doesn't reflect current market conditions. PaineWebber eased 1/4 to 16 3/4. Other brokerage stocks were little changed, except Morgan Stanley, which fell 2 3/8 to 51.    Union Carbide rose 7/8 to 22 on more than 7.6 million shares. DPL Inc. eased 3/8 to 23 1/8 on volume of more than two million shares. Dividend-capture strategies have served up some big losses for investors in the market's severe drop recently. But traders attributed the huge volume in these two issues to investors' wanting to capture forthcoming quarterly payouts by these two companies.    Santa Fe Southern Pacific rose 4 3/4 to 55 on news that Henley Group is negotiating to acquire the company for $63 a share. Henley made the statement in an SEC filing, in which it stated that it had raised its stake in Santa Fe to 14.7% from 14.1%. Henley fell 1 5/8 to 20 5/8 in OTC trading.    Piedmont Aviation jumped 7 3/8 to 70 3/8. The Transportation Department late Friday approved USAir Group's $1.56 billion acquisition of Piedmont. In September, an administrative law judge had urged that the merger not be allowed because of potentially anticompetitive consequences. Piedmont will continue to operate as a separate airline for at least nine months. USAir moved up 1 3/8 to 32 5/8.    USG Corp. added 1/2 to 35 3/4. Members of USG's senior management said they have no intention of participating in a leveraged buy-out proposed by Desert Partners. The Desert group, which has a 9.9% stake in USG and is being led by Texas oil men Jack E. Brown and Cyril Wagner Jr., had indicated that it might pay more than $50 a share in a friendly merger. USG has sued to stop the group from buying any more shares.    Bell andamp; Howell advanced 3 1/2 to 55. An investor group, including Fort Worth, Texas, investor Robert M. Bass, raised its stake in Bell andamp; Howell to 15.9%. In an SEC filing, the group said it purchased the shares between Oct. 12 and last Wednesday at $41.16 to $69.05 a share.    Several other stocks involved in mergers or in which corporate raiders have established a substantial stake were also higher yesterday. Singer rose 3 1/8 to 47 1/4; Brockway gained 6 to 51; Telex moved up 4 3/4 to 55 7/8, and Southland added 3 3/8 to 61 5/8.    DynCorp, formerly Dynalectron Corp., fell 3/4 to 17 7/8. The company accepted an offer from a management group to be acquired for $19.50 in cash and $3.50 in debt securities. </TEXT></DOC>
