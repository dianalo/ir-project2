(both now part of ComputerAssociates, Garden City, N.Y.); Cincom, Cincinnati; IBM; and Software AG,Reston, Va.andP;  The finalists were software AG, with Adabase, ADR, withDatacom/DB, and Cincom, with Supra.andM;SW AG SATISFIED USERSandM;&quot;We visted two or three users of each DBMS we were interested in,&quot; Othicsaid.andP;  &quot;We wanted to be sure users were happy with the DBMS before we made aselection.andP;  The company finally selected Adabas because of its &quot;integratedapproach and the feedback we got from Adabas users.&quot;andM;The utility then decided to design all new applications for Adabas.andP;  Thecompany ruled against converting IMS applications to Adabas, fearing that IBMsupport for IMS may decline.andP;  &quot;A lot of our IMS systems will expireeventually.andP;  Within five to 10 years, we won't need them,&quot; Othic said.andM;Othic also noted that the Human Resource Management System from InformationScience Inc., Montvale, N.J., a key IMS package used by the company, wasrecently ported to Adabas.andP;  &quot;That will take care of a lot of problems forus,&quot; he said.andM;Public Service of New Mexico found the active data dictionary and integratedfamily of products they wanted in Software AG's Predict Data Dictionary andIntegrated Software Architecture (ISA).andM;Integration of hardware and operating system environments was the top issuefor Maritime Life Assurance Company of Halifax, Nova Scotia.andM;&quot;Having an integrated environment that promoted productivity for ourdevelopers was very important to us,&quot; said Madeleine Clare, manager ofsystems development, &quot;We wanted to migrate to an environment that wouldimprove productivity and accessibility of data of our developers and endusers.&quot;andM;Like Public Service of New Mexico, Maritime Life carefully analyzed thevarious offerings, but the insurance carrier selected CA-Datacom/DB, fromComputer Associates.andM;&quot;We defined a specific strategy for conducting the selection and reviewprocess,&quot; Clare said.andP;  &quot;The primary objectives were a database managementsystem, in active data dictionary, application development tools, a queryfacility and a multi-platform environment.&quot;andM;The company also sought input from other insurance companies using variousDBMS products.andM;&quot;Our project team consisted of three internal full-time people for three orfour months,&quot; Clare said.andP;  &quot;We also used consultants from the DMR Group.&quot;andM;Meanwhile, during the evaluation process, Computer Associates acquiredADR--adding another issue to be resolved.andM;&quot;Initially, we were nervous about it,&quot; says Clare.andP;  &quot;We extended our pilotand we visited the Dallas office of Computer Associates to talk to theproduct developers.andP;  We extended our evaluation period until ComputerAssociates issued their position paper on database directions.andP;  We found thatthe position papers matched our plans for where we wanted to go with thetechnology.&quot;andM;Clare said, &quot;A strategic part of our decision to go with Datacom/DB washaving SQL compatibility.&quot;andP;  Computer Associates has promised to incorporateSQL in its DBMS software.andM;&quot;What's important about relational is that you adhere to the logical modeland the relational model addresses the logical implentation of data--not thephysical implementation,&quot; says George Van Schaick, vice president ofmarketing in the CAI Information Management Software organization.andM;&quot;SQL happens to be the language the industry has latched onto to talk to themodel,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;The model does not address how you physically implementthe data.&quot;andM;THE SWISSAIR STORYandM;Swissair inZurich installed IMS in 1976 and has since invested hundreds ofthousands of Swiss francs in IMS applications.andM;Peter Sturzenegger, division manager for technical support and applicationdevelopment at Swissair, said, &quot;Many installations feel that the way toimprove on IMS is to implement whatever IBM offers.andP;  We tried that.andP;  Weinstalled DB2 for a year as a technical improvement over the IMS environment.andM;&quot;But we decided we needed a more integrated environment than we had,&quot; hesaid.andP;  &quot;We wanted a development language integrated with the DBMS and we werevery interested in haing an integrated data catalog.&quot;andM;The finalists for the contract were Supra, Model 204 from Computer Corp. ofAmerica, Cambridge, Mass., and Adabas from Software AG.andM;The Cincom offering was selected after Swissair officials saw a presentationon its use at Hershey Chocolate in Heshey, Pa.andM;&quot;That introduced us to the three-schema architecture,&quot; Sturzenegger said.andO;&quot;That was when we saw the value of an integrated data dictionary.andP;  We alsosaw the value of the Ansi Sparc committee's work on the three-schema model tomake applications independent of the underlying DBMS.andM;Meanwhile, &quot;to protect our investment in IMS, Cincom agreed to create anISM/Supra bridge for us,&quot; Sturzenegger said.andP;  &quot;A full function, synchronizedupdate of both Supra and the bridge product have been promised by Cincom toship in April.&quot;andM;&quot;We feel we have created an application development environment where we canprotect our existing investment in IMS and yet migrate to new applications inMantis and Supra.andP;  We feel very safe with our decision,&quot; he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
