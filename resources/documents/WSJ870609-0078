They are surely the most learned people in the world on the habits and the flavors of squid, and if that doesn't earn them a place in heaven, it at least wins them the respect of squid illiterates who couldn't even guess the answers to: (1) What is the fastest invertebrate in the world? and (2) What invertebrate has the largest eyes?    The answer to both questions is, you guessed it, squid, the almighty squid, which the people of Monterey honor and eat every Memorial Day weekend at their annual squid festival. The festival, in its fourth year, is a fund raiser for charities of the Monterey Kiwanis Club, and a booster for the local squid industry, the largest in the U.S.    Two tons of squid were consumed during the two-day festival, and served in such forms as squid kabob, squid pie, squid chowder, barbecued squid, squid ceviche, deep-fried squid, squid sandwich, squid salad, squid teriyaki, squid marinara, squid pizza, and scads of other squiddities.    One of the purposes of the festival was to educate people and their palates to squid's delights, said festival manager Bob Massaro. Unless the students of squid were completely turned off by the taste of say, squid doughnuts, they had about 30 other squid concoctions to sample in their personal research.    While munching deep-fried squid legs (there are 10 of them a creature), the 20,319 festival-goers could round out their squiducation by viewing a video of squid mating (the act takes about four seconds), watching live squid dart frontward and backward in a tropical-fish aquarium (squid move by an internal water propulsion system), and reading displays on the local industry (Monterey squid fishermen catch about 10,000 tons of squid in a good year).    But they saved all the fun stuff for the kiddies -- slathering dead squids with tempera paint and making squid prints on paper. The kids could then take their squid prints home to tack on their bedroom wall or stick on the refrigerator with a squid magnet purchased at the souvenir booth.    There was a long line at the squid face-painting booth, from which small children emerged with large squid bodies painted on their foreheads and 10 squid legs extending down their cheeks. There was also a Kids' Squid Skit at which employees of the Monterey Aquarium dressed three bemused children in squid costumes and made them pretend they were a school of squid.    It was obvious that some people attending the festival weren't quite sure why they were there. When local fish market and restaurant owner Johnny Favaloro held up a squid to begin his squid-cleaning demonstration, part of his audience gasped with horror or groaned with revulsion. A few women actually screamed when Mr. Favaloro popped a piece of raw squid in his mouth.    For those people, there were other food items for sale, such as barbecued ribs and pork kabobs. But anyone who couldn't get his fill of squid could look forward to next year's festival, when the repertoire of squid offerings will be expanded by the 1987 winners in the annual squid-recipe contest.    If the squid doughnut didn't make you want to squidaddle, you might be interested in some of these new ideas for cooking this versatile cephalopod. How about a squid version of cheese blintzes, or a squid version of chili rellenos? The grand prize in the recipe contest went to Kay Covert for &quot;Squid Benedict.&quot; Try it at your next power breakfast.    ---   Ms. Hauser is a free-lance writer based in Portland, Ore. </TEXT></DOC>
