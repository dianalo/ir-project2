On the New York Mercantile Exchange, wholesale unleaded gasolinefor October delivery closed down 1.39 cents at 45.63 cents a gallonon Thursday after rising 3.21 cents in the previous session.   The October wholesale heating oil contract fell 1.37 cents agallon to close at 42.70 cents after a 2.24-cent rise on Wednesday.   The October contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarkgrade of U.S. crude, settled 50 cents lower at $14.90 per barrelfollowing an 84-cent rise in volatile trading on Wednesday.   Crude prices generally had been rising since plunging briefly totwo-year lows on Monday. But factors that strengthened the marketrecently began to fade early in the trading day Thursday along withreports that Hurricane Gilbert was headed for the U.S. Gulf ofMexico coast, analysts said.   Oil and gas companies operating in the Gulf had evacuated manyof their personnel from refineries and oil platforms, but observerssaid the prospect of a major disruption in oil supplies due to theapproaching hurricane waned.   ``Traders seem to feel that (Hurricane) Gilbert is not going todo a lot of damage now,'' said John Hill of Merrill Lynch EnergyFutures.   Companies reporting the evacuation of oil platforms andrefineries along the Gulf indicated they would not restartoperations until next week.   But analysts said it was unlikely there would be any spotshortages of oil products such as gasoline and heating oil and noeffect on contracts scheduled for October delivery.   Approximately 870,000 barrels per day of oil and 8 million cubicfeet of natural gas are produced at Gulf facilities, according tothe Minerals Management Service.   Also depressing prices Thursday was a statement from Iraq's oilminister that his country would not lower its oil output if askedto do so by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries andinstead might raise production.   The minister's statement punctured the upward momentum thatbegan Monday when Saudi Arabia's King Fahd made a rare publicstatement calling for cooperation among OPEC and non-OPECoil-producing nations in restraining oil production.   Iraq has refused to abide by its OPEC-assigned quota of 1.5million barrels a day and is reported to be producing about 2.7million barrels a day. Some observers hoped that after a recentcease-fire in its 8-year-old war with Iran, Iraq would join withother OPEC nations in setting production limits that would helpraise prices.   Other OPEC nations also are exceeding quotas.   The Iraqi statement also dampened hopes that a Sept. 25 meetingof OPEC's price monitoring committee would produce substantiveresults.</TEXT></DOC>
