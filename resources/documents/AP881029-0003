The Army selected a partnership formed by divisions of GeneralMotors Corp. and Allied Signal Aerospace Co. to develop the enginefor its new light attack and observation helicopter for use beyondthe end of this century.   The new craft is to replace aging fleets of Vietnam-era AH-1Cobra, OH-6 Cayuse and OH-58 Kiowa choppers.   The winning team, called Light Helicopter Turbine Co., iscomposed of the GM's Allison Gas Turbine Division and AlliedSignal's Garrett Engine Division. The group previously had receiveda contract worth $132.4 million and the deal announced Friday wasfor another $75.4 million to continue the work.   The two partners are expected eventually to compete forproduction awards. The engine work ultimately is expected to beworth more than $1.5 billion to the two companies.   First deliveries are scheduled for 1995.   The Army also gave the go-ahead to two other groups to competefor the job of designing the rest of the chopper. One of the groupsis a joint venture of Boeing Helicopters and United Technology'sSikorsky Aircraft; the other is a partnership that includes units ofMcDonnell Douglas Corp. and Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. Each teamreceived $158 million to pursue their design work.   The Army hopes to purchase 2,096 of the new helicopters at a costof roughly $40 billion.   The computer contract awarded to ATandamp;T, for $929.1 million,establishes the company's position in the industry for years to comewith what has been described as the computer contract of the century.   The Air Force, which acted as the executive agent for the otherservices in overseeing the bidding, said an ATandamp;T subsidiary, ATandamp;TTechnologies Inc., had been selected over five competitors and wouldbe expected to deliver about 20,000 minicomputers over the next fiveyears.   ATandamp;T said the award was the largest computer contract everawarded by the federal government. Company officials said the valuecould exceed $1 billion depending on the options exercised.   The Air Force is buying the computers for its own use as well asthat of the Army, Navy, Coast Guard, Defense Communications Agencyand Defense Logistics Agency.</TEXT></DOC>
