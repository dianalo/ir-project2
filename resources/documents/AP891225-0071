But after copies of an alleged transcript were leaked on CapitolHill, Baize found himself out of a job and at the center of aninternational intrigue that has touched Minnesota's agriculturecommissioner _ and apparently angered Agriculture Secretary ClaytonYeutter.   At a yearend news conference Thursday, Yeutter appealed forbroad support of liberalized trade policies being advocated inGeneva in ongoing negotiations under the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade.   Yeutter said he believes there is broad support for the Bushadministration's proposals but noted that ``we have seen someevidence of undercutting here and there by particular groups,''which he did not identify.   Kelly Shipp, his press secretary, later told The AssociatedPress that Yeutter referred mostly to Minnesota AgricultureCommissioner Jim Nichols, a Democrat, and not specifically to anyfarm organizations.   Pressed about Nichols, she said only that Nichols was ``the onethat's on his mind.''   In an interview Friday, Nichols said the ``Baize incident'' andYeutter's complaints are linked, and he is not Yeutter's onlyopponent on GATT issues.   Nichols' farm policy analyst, Mark Ritchie, is responsible forcirculating copies of Baize's interview with the European studentto Minnesota sugar beet growers _ who have a stake in protectingthe government's strict quotas on sugar imports. Those commentsended up on Capitol Hill and sparked the furor that led to Baize'sresignation on Nov. 10 from the job he had held since 1979.   As Baize's comments were circulated anonymously on Capitol Hill,Ritchie also was circulating GATT documents in Congress from theU.S. Trade Representative, which Nichols contended pitted soybeanfarmers against sugar producers.   Baize believes the student who taped the August interview _which he thought was to be an academic discussion to help her writea thesis on agricultural trade _ turned the tape over to anorganization in France.   Baize said the French group apparently gave the interview toRitchie, who acknowledges providing summaries to Minnesota sugarbeet growers.   Those growers contacted others in the sugar industry and thetranscript was suddenly being ``faxed all over the Hill,'' Baizesaid.   Marlyn Jorgensen, president of the American Soybean Association,moved to assure Rep. Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, chairman of theHouse Agriculture Committee, that the ASA does not oppose the U.S.sugar program.   In a letter dated Oct. 25, Jorgensen told de la Garza, whosedistrict includes Texas' sugar cane growers, that Baize's commentshad been taken out of context and ``it appears that ASA has beenused for purposes that many of us do not know.''   `I cant' believe John lost his job over this deal,'' Nicholssaid. ``John's said it for years.''   Said Baize: ``I had a frank, academic discussion and Iunderstood and was told it was to be off the record. I resentanyone using an off-the-record interview, taking things out ofcontext, with a malicious intent to injure me. But so be it.''   Baize, a Gatesville, Texas, native, said his sources say thestudent was told before she left Europe to specifically interviewhim, and that when she returned, the group asked for only oneinterview tape out of 25 or 30 _ his.   Baize said he may have been singled out because he was thearchitect of the Soybean Association's charge that the EuropeanCommunity's oilseed subsidies were illegal under internationaltrading rules.   A dispute settlement panel of GATT ruled ``the U.S. position was100 percent correct,'' Baize said.   ``The fact that we filed the case and were very aggressive inpersuing it here and in Europe, angered a lot of people in theoilseed industry in France and Europe,'' Baize said.   Ritchie, the farm policy analyst, claims Baize knew theinterview was on the record and that the student's report would bepublished in Europe.   Ritchie, who is on a technical review committee for thestudent's thesis, said Baize's comments put his state's $370million sugar beet industry at risk by giving Europe moreammunition to fight the U.S. sugar program in GATT.   Baize, meanwhile, said he has ``other irons in the fire,'' andis not bitter at his former employer.   ``I guess I've always been a sucker for these students who comein and want to learn something,'' Baize said.</TEXT></DOC>
