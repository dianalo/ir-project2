(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Eastman Kodak Co. said Wednesday itsfirst-quarter earnings dipped 6 percent, while sales fell slightly.   Kodak Chairman Colby H. Chandler said he still expects to seepositive results from the company's major restructuring last yearin the second half of 1990.   ``Barring unexpected developments in the economy, we believe therecovery forecast for Kodak will come about,'' Chandler said.   A strong showing by Kodak's core imaging segment was offset bylower profits in its chemicals and information segments, thecompany said.   ``While first-quarter results were slightly below those reportedat this time last year, they are consistent with the company'sbusiness plan for 1990, which calls for higher sales and earningsfor the full year,'' he said.   Income for the quarter ending March 31 was $199 million, or 61cents per share, compared to $212 million, or 65 cents per share,in the first quarter of 1989.   Sales for the first quarter dipped 2 percent to $4.1 billionfrom $4.2 billion in the same period last year. Chandler said saleswould have been about level if an extra week of business activityhad been excluded from the first quarter of 1989.   Figures for 1989 were restated to reflect the company's changefrom a 13-period to a 12-month calendar year.   The Rochester-based photographic giant began a $549 millionrestructuring in 1989, selling or consolidating about 20 businessesand eliminating 7,500 jobs.   Chandler has said he expects to see the restructuring translateinto better earnings and improved cash flows in the second half of1990.   David Nelson, an industry analyst with Shearson Lehman HuttonInc. in New York, said the first-quarter drop was not unexpected.   ``The numbers are mixed, but on balance positive,'' Nelson said.``The improvements from last year's restructuring have not hit theincome statement yet.''   In the first quarter, ``Kodak margins held steady, cash flow waspositive, and debt was reduced,'' Chandler said.   Earnings improved by more than 50 percent in the company's coreimaging segment because of lower operating costs and higher prices.Profits dropped 38 percent in the chemicals segment and 20 percentin the information segment.   Chandler blamed the decline in chemicals earnings on high rawmaterial costs and a power outage that shut down the company'sKingsport, Tenn., plant temporarily.   The information segment was affected by a soft U.S. market forbusiness equipment, he said. Health segment earnings declined 3percent for the quarter.</TEXT></DOC>
