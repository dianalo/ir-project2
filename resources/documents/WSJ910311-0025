Between December and late February, Mexico sold oilfutures contracts that locked in some of the gains from lastyear's surge in prices that followed Iraq's invasion ofKuwait. It was the first time Mexico has hedged itsproduction in this way, but its initial foray into futureswas anything but timid. Mexico sold futures contractscovering about three months' worth of crude exports, whichhave averaged 1.3 million barrels a day.</LP><TEXT>   Oil futures contracts guarantee the seller a specifiedprice -- and the buyer a specified supply -- at some futuredate.   Mexico's overall strategy was to ensure that it receivedat least $17 a barrel, the price used as the basis for its1991 budget, no matter what might happen to oil prices duringthe year.   According to traders in New York who asked not to beidentified, Mexico began the hedging process in December, andit locked in prices of more than $20 a barrel for some monthsahead. Those transactions, which were apparently made througha number of firms that trade oil, now look pretty smart:Crude oil for April delivery closed Friday at $19.31 abarrel, down 11 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.The May contract ended at $19.02 a barrel, and later monthssettled at less than $19.   A Mexican Finance Ministry official said the country usedseveral intermediaries to market its futures contracts, buthe declined to identify them. Traders frequently mentionGoldman, Sachs andamp; Co. as one of the firms involved. Goldman'ssenior oil trader, Steve Semlitz, declined to discuss anylarge oil trades that the Mexicans had entered into with hisfirm or any other company.   By dispersing its business among a number ofintermediaries, Mexico limited the extent to which itsactions affected the market, traders said. Spreading thetransactions among several months' contracts also diluted theeffect, they noted.   The quantity of production Mexico sold on the futuresmarket did seem unusually large to some analysts --especially for Mexico. Oil is the emblem of Mexicannationalism, and the government has often been reluctant totreat it like other commodities. &quot;Selling that quantity ofoil seems to reflect a sharper, more hardheaded attitude bythe Mexicans,&quot; said a trader familiar with Mexico.   The Finance Ministry official explained the reasoning: &quot;Itis extremely important for us that investors know that, nomatter what happens to the price of oil, the economic programis on for 1991. Regardless of what happens, we've got $17 abarrel . . . and there's enough in the kitty.&quot;   And what has happened is that since the end of the war,the weighted average dollar price per barrel of Mexico'sthree types of crude oil has fallen to the low teens,compared with around $25 at several peak Mideast crisistimes. Mexico won't know exactly how well it did on itsfutures trades for five or six months, when delivery will bedue on some of its later contracts. But analysts generallyexpect continued weakness in oil prices for some time, whichwould make Mexico's strategy a winner.   The futures trading was &quot;a very, very wise decision,&quot; saysprivate economist Benito Solis. &quot;It's a healthy change fromgovernment policy during the last oil price rise, wheneveryone was betting that oil could only go up.&quot; Mexico'sexuberance during the 1970s oil boom prompted the governmentto borrow heavily against future oil earnings. When pricescollapsed, Mexico tumbled into a morass of debt.   Mexico's current president, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, wascareful not to repeat that mistake. Even though Mexico wascheered by the extra $3 billion in oil revenue it earned fromlast year's price surge, Mr. Salinas and Finance MinisterPedro Aspe have tried to insulate the economy against adownturn in prices. Some of the extra oil revenue, along with$1.5 billion taken in from the sale of the state telephonemonopoly, has been set aside in a special contingency fund.   As a result of the government's approach, Mexicaninvestors have taken the recent oil price decline in stride.Over the past week, interest rates, a bellwether of investorconfidence, have held steady, and the stock market hasstrengthened.   Chile and Brazil also have tried to turn oil-pricevolatility to their advantage, Wall Street traders said,though as buyers rather than sellers. Chile in recent weekslocked in oil supplies at relatively good prices of less than$20 a barrel, according to one trader. But Brazil hasn'tfared so well, he said: It bought some contracts atrelatively high prices toward the end of last year.   Mexico's move into oil futures isn't unprecedented for aproducing country. &quot;It's not unusual for a country to use thesystem of hedging -- and, in most cases we've seen, tobenefit from it,&quot; says Peter Beutel, energy director ofPegasus Econometric Group, Hoboken, N.J. Market sources saidNorway has played the futures market in the past and thatVenezuela is looking into it.   Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:                                                                                                          Grains and Soybeans                                                                                                          After the close of trading today, the U.S. AgricultureDepartment is widely expected to lower its forecast ofsoybean production in Brazil because of dry weather in somegrowing regions there.   According to Don Roose, an analyst at U.S. CommoditiesInc., Des Moines, Iowa, traders expect the department to trimits February forecast of a 17.5 million metric ton harvest inBrazil by at least 500,000 metric tons. A metric ton is2,204.6 pounds.   Brazil is a major competitor of the U.S. as a worldsoybean supplier. U.S. soybean prices climbed Friday inanticipation of the U.S. government forecast. Soybeans forMay delivery closed at $6.0950 a bushel on the Chicago Boardof Trade, up eight cents.   Traders this week also will continue to watch the weatherin Kansas and Oklahoma, where a dry spell has led to concernabout growing conditions for the winter wheat crop. Somemeteorologists, however, see an increased chance of rain inthe area this week.                                                                                                          Precious Metals                                                                                                          Traders and investors will be looking to see whethersilver's streak can last.   The May futures contract surged as high as $4.24 an ounceFriday before ending at $4.207, up 19.2 cents. Since Feb. 22,the May silver contract has risen 65 cents, or 18%.   April-delivery platinum, meanwhile, streaked to $413.50 anounce at one point Friday and finished at $411.40, up $10.90.Its price has gained $34.70, or 9%, since Feb. 25. Gold forApril delivery gained $2.70 an ounce to $371.20.   Analysts attributed the rise in silver and gold to buyingof bullion by Swiss investors. Until early last week,silver's rally was largely driven by technical factors,analysts said. But &quot;fresh, quality&quot; buying extended the rallylater in the week, said William O'Neill, senior futuresstrategist at Merrill Lynch.   Labor strife at a silver mine in Mexico has caused somesupply disruptions, and demand from the jewelry industry hasincreased recently, said Dinsa Mehta, chief bullion trader atChase Manhattan Bank. He also said investors now think therecession didn't hurt silver demand as much as was previouslybelieved. He said silver could rise to $4.50 an ounce.   Mr. O'Neill and Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst atPaineWebber, are cautious in their outlook. Risingunemployment doesn't bode well for investment demand, Mr.Savaiko said, because silver is considered &quot;the poor man'sgold.&quot; He anticipates a silver-price correction, possibly asteep one.   Mr. O'Neill is on the watch for signs of producers -- whohave held back in recent weeks -- starting to sell into therally. In the past two years, he said, producers have killedevery rally in precious metals prices.                                                                                                          CRB Futures Index                                                                                                          After surging from four-year lows the week before, theindex sputtered last week as it encountered some technicalresistance above 220. It rose 0.93 Friday to end at 221.84, arise of 5.6% since Feb. 22.   Edward Yardeni, chief economist for Prudential SecuritiesInc., said the Commodity Research Bureau price index's risesuggests there is speculation that the U.S. economy willstrengthen soon and demand for commodities will rise. Andrising commodity prices, he said, also would portend animproving world economy.   A move above 223 on the CRB index might suggest totraders, and to the Federal Reserve, that inflation isrising, some analysts say. And John Murphy, president of JJMTechnical Advisors Inc. in River Edge, N.J., said he thinksthe index will break through that level in the next severaldays.   Mr. Yardeni predicts that the index will settle down forthe next couple of weeks to await harder evidence that theeconomy is recovering. But he said he expects the index torise to between 230 and 240 by midyear.</TEXT></DOC>
