Animal data are frequently resortedfor risk assessment calculations. Such a decision should account forpotential errors in animal to human risk extrapolations, which may beof 1 or 2 orders of magnitude or more. Because historical human exposurecan usually be estimated with confidence that the errors would be considerablyless than 1 order of magnitude, it follows that human studies shouldgenerally take precedence over animal studies, even when crude assumptionshave to be made concerning human exposure levels. This paper illustratesthis with cancer risk assessments for vinyl chloride and antimony, bothof which relied on use of the stipulated average cohort exposure levelswithout use of any individual exposure data for cohort members. Linearextrapolations of risk to low exposures were used in both instances.Non-cancer risk assessments were illustrated by examining results ofexperimental studies of effects of ozone on ventilatory function. A simpleapproach, in this case involving visual inspection of study results,was again recommended. Consideration was given to concerns about synergisticeffects of low-level exposure to chemical mixtures. Calculations werepresented to demonstrate that estimating risks by multiplying effectsof individual chemicals produces the same risk estimated by adding effects,provided that exposure levels were sufficiently low for each individualagent. It was concluded that epidemiology has much to offer to environmentalhealth risk assessment, but that epidemiologists need to be more effectivein justifying the scientific basis of the design and interpretation ofepidemiological studies to laboratory scientists, who frequently rejectepidemiological findings for inappropriate reasons.</TEXT></DOC>
