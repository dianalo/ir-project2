Leases may be structuredin a variety of ways, and the tax advantages/disadvantages of leasingare discussed. Mention is made of the tax validity of leasing and theability of the parties involved to deduct rental payments as a businessexpense or to use capital cost allowances. In the context of energy projectfinancing, the long life of typical project facilities introduces difficulties.Under present tax rules, transferring title to the lessee after the lessorhas recovered his investment and the required return could render thelease arrangement invalid for tax purposes. This would have the resultthat the lessor could not claim the capital cost allowance that had alreadybeen factored into the pricing of the lease. Possible solutions includestructuring the lease to allow transferring of the lessor's interestto a third party at the end of the initial lease term. Leasing is alsodiscussed as a means for financing large projects. Leveraged leasing,where the financier can obtain full ownership of the equipment and accordinglythe full tax benefits of ownership without paying the full cost, providesbenefits to the financier through the earnings from the investment ofthe deferred taxes. This paper concludes with a presentation of the advantagesand disadvantages of leasing, and the possible risks for the partiesinvolved.</TEXT></DOC>
