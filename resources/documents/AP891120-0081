In what may, or may not, be the last word in theirink-splattered battle over which one of them hurt President Reaganmore, the former White House chief of staff said Mrs. Reagan``seems incapable of understanding how her words and deeds mightseem selfish, hypocritical and, indeed, even frightening to thoseon the outside.''   She and her ghostwriter, William Novak, ``have produced aclassic of inadvertent confession,'' Regan wrote in a Washingtonianmagazine review of ``My Turn,'' Mrs. Reagan's memoirs.   ``Very sadly, and most of all, this book gives aid and comfortto those who still believe that Ronald Reagan never should havebeen elected president in the first place,'' Regan said.   The story so far:   _In May 1988, Regan, having been fired 13 months earlier,published his memoirs. They pictured Mrs. Reagan as a scheming,``shadowy, distaff presidency'' and disclosed her use of astrologerJoan Quigley.   ``Virtually every major move and decision the Reagans madeduring my time as White House chief of staff was cleared in advancewith a woman in San Francisco who drew up horoscopes,'' he wrote.   _Last month, in ``My Turn,'' Mrs. Reagan got even. She wrotethat Regan had often ``acted as if he were president'' and deservedto be fired because the Iran-Contra affair occurred ``on hiswatch.''   She also acknowledged turning to Ms. Quigley for advice, butonly for scheduling decisions, not policy or politics. She accusedRegan of having ``betrayed'' a confidential relationship with theastrologer. She said she never guessed he would take that fact``and twist it to seek his revenge on Ronnie and me.''   Taking his turn, Regan said astrology played a bigger role thanMrs. Reagan was willing to admit.   ``I wrote about astrology because it was an essential truthabout the way the Reagans operated,'' Regan wrote.   ``It was a daily, sometimes hourly, factor in every decisionaffecting the president's schedule ... He _ or in this case she _who controls the president's schedule controls the workings of thepresidency.''   Regan also raised security questions, saying the nation owes Ms.Quigley a vote of gratitude for not revealing to a potentialassassin ``intimidate details of presidential movements.''   As for the larger question, Regan asserted that Mrs. Reagan _ inacidly criticizing many of Ronald Reagan's closest advisers,including Edwin Meese III, James Baker III, David Stockman,Alexander M. Haig, William Clark and William Casey _ ``damages herhusband and his presidency,'' Regan said.   ``After all,'' he wrote, ``these were Ronald Reagan's choices,made after close consultation with his financial and politicalsupporters and friends in California; he must have thought thatthey met his own standards.''</TEXT></DOC>
