You read theinstructions five times. You double-checked all the numbersbackward and forward. You even licked the stamp twice.   Now you get a letter from the folks at the InternalRevenue Service saying they don't buy the result.</LP><TEXT>   Should you appeal?   Absolutely -- if the money involved is significant, taxprofessionals say.   In fact, the service has set up a detailed procedure forpeople like you. It covers everything from minordisagreements and &quot;document mismatches,&quot; which you can handleby correspondence, to the more complicated disagreements thatend up in Tax Court. You can even handle small claimsyourself without an accountant or attorney in certainstreamlined, simplified systems.   And, contrary to popular opinion, the IRS doesn't &quot;punish&quot;taxpayers who appeal their taxes by automatically auditingthem every year thereafter. So don't let fear of retributionkeep you from appealing.   That said, there are still reasons to think twice aboutgoing to the mat with the IRS, especially if the amount atissue is small.   For one thing, the costs can quickly add up if you pushthe matter far enough that you have to hire a CPA or anattorney. &quot;You may prevail -- but can you afford justice?&quot;asks Julian Block, a Larchmont, N.Y., tax specialist, writerand attorney.   The same is true if further examination of your returnmight open other areas to IRS questioning. &quot;Before startingthe IRS appeals process, a taxpayer should figure out whatthe whole thing will cost and what are his chances ofsuccess,&quot; says Saul Braverman, managing partner of BravermanCodron andamp; Co., a Beverly Hills, Calif., CPA firm. &quot;There'salways the danger of opening up latent issues.&quot;   And while your appeal is winding its way through thebureaucratic maze, interest of 11% annually is being assessedagainst your back taxes. If you lose, you'll have to pay thatinterest plus any penalties.   &quot;So unless the IRS is flat wrong or there is some law onyour side, it's not going to pay to dispute it,&quot; says Mr.Block.   With that caution, here's a look at how the IRS appealsprocess works, and some tips from tax pros on how to navigateits tortuous maze.                                                                                                          THE SIMPLEST DISAGREEMENT                                                                                                          If you get an ominous-looking letter from the IRS, thechances are pretty good it's going to be something called aCP2000. That's a form advising you that, for example, theinterest or dividend numbers you put on your tax return don'tgibe with the numbers the IRS has.   Don't panic. This is the most common type of disagreementwith the IRS. It's a mismatch of information on your taxreturn with information also reported to the IRS from a thirdparty.   Typically, you may have reported interest payments of$200, and the IRS may have 1099 forms from banks thatindicate you received interest of $400. Sometimes theinformation the IRS has is incorrect because of a clerical ormathematical error.   If the IRS is wrong, write a letter explaining your case,attaching any documentation you have and the original IRSnotice you received. That should be the end of it if you havea logical explanation, says Rob Giannangeli, Los Angelespublic affairs director for the IRS. &quot;The matter should betaken care of in six weeks,&quot; he says.   When the IRS doesn't agree, it should explain why, andlater send you a bill for the additional tax. If you don'tagree and can't resolve the question through the mail, callyour district office to set up a personal interview.                                                                                                          THE SERIOUS DISPUTE                                                                                                          All right, let's say your return is audited, and youdisagree with the examiner's finding. There's just no way youowe that much additional tax. Now what do you do?   Your first level of appeal is the examiner's supervisor.But don't expect too much. &quot;It's unusual for the supervisorto make a different finding than the agent,&quot; says WilliamRaby, senior tax lecturer at Arizona State University and atax newsletter editor. &quot;Supervisors tend to back up theexaminer, who is part of their office.&quot;   Assuming that's what happens in your case, the next stepis to take the matter to a regional appeals office. Write toyour local district director or service center director torequest an appeals conference. And take heart: The appealsoffice is independent of your local district.   The IRS allows you to represent yourself at the appealsconference or to have a CPA, enrolled agent or attorney speakon your behalf. But do some serious thinking before going italone.   Sure, having a pro there will probably be expensive. &quot;Youmay be talking of 10 to 20 hours of professional time,&quot; Mr.Raby says. &quot;At $175 to $250 an hour, that adds up to a bigbill.&quot;   But it may be worth it. An experienced tax professionalcan &quot;save you the time and aggravation,&quot; says Mr. Raby. Andthe pros tend to get better results. Most appeals cases aresettled with the individual paying 40% to 45% of the originalamount the agent proposed, according to Mr. Raby. &quot;Thewealthier taxpayers have the best CPAs and lawyers helpingthem, and the little guys acting for themselves don't do aswell.&quot;   Many pros don't even like to bring their clients along tomeetings with appeals officers. &quot;Clients are usually toodefensive and annoyed,&quot; says William Brennan, tax partner atErnst andamp; Young in Washington, D.C. &quot;They say more than isnecessary, bring up peripheral issues and get themselves infurther trouble.&quot;   Tax pros like dealing with the IRS appeals office becausethey can cut a deal. Gary Glassman, managing tax partner atWeber Lipshie andamp; Co., a New York CPA firm, says he has hadmore success at the appeals office than with IRS agents orsupervisors. Why? Appeals officers &quot;are more practical,&quot; hesays. &quot;They weigh the hazards of litigation and can settlecases on the spot. They have flexibility.&quot; Many appealsofficers are attorneys.                                                                                                          A TRIP TO TAX COURT                                                                                                          Say you're still not satisfied. Avenues are still open.You can go to court.   Most taxpayers take the Tax Court route because that waythey don't have to pay the tax first and then sue to get arefund, says Thomas Boyle, Los Angeles tax partner for CPAsDeloitte andamp; Touche. &quot;They like the idea that the governmentwill have to take the money from them if they want to getit.&quot;   You have 90 days after receiving a formal IRS &quot;notice ofdeficiency&quot; to file a petition with the Tax Court.   And there is still one last chance for thedo-it-yourselfer. If your dispute is $10,000 or less, you canask to have your case heard under &quot;small claims simplifiedprocedures&quot; in Tax Court.   And you can represent yourself. It's not necessarily truehere that taxpayers who represent themselves have fools forclients. Mr. Raby says that individuals &quot;can do well {insmall-claims tax court} if they are reasonably intelligentand get a briefing from a CPA on the technical issuesinvolved.&quot;   But beware: A case settled under the small-claimsprocedure can't be appealed. Once you take this path, thereis no way out.   To have your case heard before the regular Tax Court, youmust hire a lawyer or a professional who has passed a specialtest for admission to practice there. Once your case is onthe court's docket, you and your attorney will have theopportunity to meet with IRS lawyers.   Even the U.S. government prefers to settle instead oftaking the time and money for a full court trial. In nine of10 cases, the dispute is settled in a compromise before itever gets into the courtroom, Mr. Raby says. If your casegets into court, it may take as long as five years after yourreturn was originally filed to get a final determination, headds.   Remember that if you lose, the interest and penaltiesmounting during those years could loom even larger than theoriginal amount of your dispute.                                                                                                          THE MERCIFUL GENERAL COURT?                                                                                                          It's also possible to bypass Tax Court, and have your casedecided by a jury in a general court. But in this approach,you must pay the disputed tax in full and then file for arefund. If the IRS disallows your claim, you may take yourcase to the U.S. Claims Court or your U.S. district court.                                                                                                          THE LAST RESORT                                                                                                          The IRS appeals procedure sounds logical. But what if --like a number of unfortunate taxpayers every year -- youthink you have settled your case but you continue to getdunning notices? And the IRS threatens to place a lien onyour assets to pay the disputed tax?   Call the IRS Problem Resolution Program in your district.This is a special office set up for taxpayers who've beenunable to resolve their disputes. &quot;We use it as much as wecan,&quot; says Mr. Braverman, the Beverly Hills CPA. &quot;These aretopnotch people who act as ombudsmen.
