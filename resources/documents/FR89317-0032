Legal Authority </ITAG>The amendments described in this notice are promulgated under authorityof sections 301, 304, 306, 307, 308, and 501 of the Clean Water Act (theFederal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1251et seq., as amended by the Clean Water Act of 1977, Pub. L. 95-217 as amendedby the Water Quality Act of 1987 Pub. L. 100-4.). <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Background </ITAG>A. Rulemaking On March 5, 1984, EPA proposed a regulation to establish Best PracticableControl Technology Currently Available (BPT) and Best Available TechnologyEconomically Achievable (BAT) effluent limitations guidelines, New SourcePerformance Standards (NSPS), Pretreatment Standards for Existing Sources(PSES), and Pretreatment Standards for New Sources (PSNS) for the nonferrousmetals forming and metal powders (nonferrous metals forming) point sourcecategory (49 FR 8112). The final regulation for the nonferrous metals formingpoint source category was promulgated on August 23, 1985 (50 FR 34242)and established effluent limitations guidelines and standards to controlspecific toxic, nonconventional and conventional pollutants for ten subcategoriesin the nonferrous metals forming and metal powders point source category.Only two of these subcategories, the nickel-cobalt forming subcategory(Subpart C) and the zirconium-hafnium forming subcategory (Subpart I),are affected by today's promulgation. The subcategories are comprised of various elements or building blockswhich are used to calculate the final effluent limits for each discharger.Today's promulgation only affects the tube reducing building blocks insubparts C and I. Tube reducing is a forming operation which may combineamines and nitrates or nitrites in the coolant-lubricant with the highenergy input of the process to generate nitrosamine compounds in the wastewaterdischarge. In sampling conducted by the Agency, nitrosamines have beenfound in tube reducing process wastewaters. Accordingly, in the final regulationthe Agency required that there be no discharge of process wastewater pollutantsfrom tube reducing operations in Subparts C and I. The Agency costed contracthauling as the model treatment technology for these subcategories. B. Settlement Agreement for Nonferrous Metals Forming After publication of the nonferrous metals forming regulation, Inco AlloysInternational, General Electric Co., Oregon Metallurgical Corporation,Teledyne WaChang, AMAX Inc. and Westinghouse Corp. filed petitions forreview of the regulation. Oregon Metallurgical Corp., Westinghouse and Teledyne WaChang subsequentlydismissed their petitions for review of the regulation. AMAX Inc. enteredinto a settlement agreement with EPA on June 29, 1987. That agreement isnot the subject of this promulgation. The two remaining petitioners, INCOAlloys International and General Electric Company entered into a settlementagreement with the Agency on November 5, 1986, which resolved all issuesraised by these petitioners. That agreement, which is the subject of thisrulemaking, only affects the nickel-cobalt forming subcategory (SubpartC) and the zirconium-hafnium forming subcategory (Subpart I). Copies ofthe Settlement Agreement have been sent to all EPA Regional Offices andto applicable State permitting authorities. As part of this Settlement Agreement, on November 5, 1986 the parties jointlyrequested the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit to staythe effectiveness of those portions of 40 CFR Part 471 which EPA proposedto amend, pending final action by EPA on the proposed amendments. On February17, 1987, the Court entered an order staying the following sections ofthe regulation promulgated on August 23, 1985: 40 CFR 471.31(d); 471.32(d);471.33(d); 471.34(d); 471.35(d); 471.91(g); 471.92(g); 471.93(g); 471.94(g);and 471.95(g). All limitations and standards contained in the final nonferrousmetals forming regulation published on August 23, 1985, which are not specificallylisted in today's amendments are not affected by today's rulemaking andare unchanged. The Agency proposed the amendments based on the settlement agreement onJuly 11, 1988, (53 FR 21774). EPA is now finalizing those amendments asproposed (except typographical corrections). Under the settlement agreement,the petitioners have the obligation to seek voluntary dismissal of theirpetitions for review. The petitioners have also agreed not to seek judicialreview of any of these amendments as they are consistent with the SettlementAgreement. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Amendments to the Nonferrous Metals Forming and Metal PowdersRegulation </ITAG>The regulation promulgated in 1985 stated that there shall be no dischargeof process wastewater pollutants from tube reducing spent lubricants. BecauseEPA found a nitrosamine compound (N-nitrosodiphenylamine) in a sample takenfrom a tube reducing spent lubricant used at one facility at a concentrationof 28.2 mg/1, EPA established a zero discharge requirement to prevent therelease of nitrosamine compounds into the environment from tube reducingspent lubricant wastewater. GE and Inco expressed concern that this regulationwould require contract hauling of the process waste stream even in caseswhere there are no measurable amounts of nitrosamines. EPA is amendingthe regulation to allow the discharge of tube reducing spent lubricantin the nickel-cobalt and zirconium-hafnium forming subcategories, as analternative limitation, provided that the spent lubricant process wastewateris analyzed once per month and found not to contain concentrations of threenitrosamines in excess of the method detection limits established for EPA'sapproved test method 1625 (40 CFR Part 136). These nitrosamines and correspondinglimits of 0.050 mg/1 of N-nitrosodimethylamine, 0.020 mg/1 of N/nitrosodiphenylamine,and 0.020 mg/1 of N-nitrosodi-n-propylamine. These three nitrosamines aremembers of the family of nitrosamine compounds that are referenced in Section307(a) of the Clean Water Act of 1977. The Agency believes that demonstratingthe presence or absence of these three nitrosamine compounds should indicatethe presence or absence of the other nitrosamine compounds because theyall are formed from the same precursors, i.e., nitrates or nitrites andamines. If, after six months of sampling, none of the samples of the tubereducing lubricant wastewater is found to contain nitrosamines above theconcentrations stated above, the frequency of sampling may be reduced toonce per quarter. Under the alternative limitation there is no mass allowancefor any pollutant discharged. Nitrosamines can be formed in the presence of precursors under the conditionscreated by the tube reducing process. If nitrosamines are found in tubereducing spent lubricant, the best method to remove them is to change thetube reducing lubricant to a new formulation in which the precursors arenot present; if the precursors are absent, then nitrosamines are not likelyto be formed. The Agency believes this control method is technically feasibleand should not result in any economic impact beyond that expected underthe original regulation. The cost of the new tube reducing lubricant shouldnot be significantly more than the cost of the old tube reducing lubricant.In any case, the facility retains the option of complying with the currentregulation (i.e., no discharge of process wastewater pollutants), whichas stated earlier, is based on contract hauling. EPA determined that thistechnology was economically achievable during the initial nonferrous metalsforming rulemaking. For all these reasons, EPA finds that this amendmentis economically achievable. This alternative limitation should result insimilar effluent reduction benefits as the previously promulgated limitationbecause plants will be prevented from discharging measurable amounts ofnitrosamines. The amendment has the additional advantage of creating anincentive to avoid the formation of nitrosamine compounds in the tube reducingprocess. All other relevant findings made in the original rulemaking areincorporated by reference into this amendment.Subparagraph (5) of the amendment specifies that the concentration limitsfor the three nitrosamine compounds listed in subparagraph (2) apply atthe point of discharge from the tube reducing process. This provision isintended to make clear that the discharge limits of subparagraph (2), whichare expressed in terms of concentration, are not to be met merely by meansof dilution. It does not mean, however, that the wastewater must be <T3>sampled </T3>at the point of discharge from the tube reducing process.Nor does it imply that the wastewater must be sampled before being treatedor commingled with other wastewater.To the contrary, because of difficulties in analyzing for nitrosaminesat very low concentration levels in an oily matrix, it may very well benecessary to treat the tube reducing spent lubricant wastewater beforesampling to determine compliance with subparagraph (2). And, in order totreat the wastewater in an economical manner, it may very well be necessaryto commingle it with other wastewater before treatment. Subparagraph (5)allows commingling or treatment of the tube reducing spent lubricant wastewaterbefore sampling. However, if commingling occurs before sampling, any dilutioncaused by the other wastewater must be taken into account in determiningcompliance with the concentration limits of subparagraph (2). This wouldmean that the concentrations of the three nitrosamine compounds in thecommingled wastewater would have to be sufficiently lower than the dischargeconcentrations specified in subparagraph (2), so that, after back-calculatingto account for the dilution, it can be determined that the concentrationsof the three nitrosamine compounds at the point of discharge from the tubereducing process did not exceed the concentration limits set forth in subparagraph(2). Subparagraph (5) provides that, where sampling occurs after commingling,the analytical method used must be sensitive enough to measure the threenitrosamine compounds at levels sufficiently low as to permit a back-calculationto account for the dilution.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Environmental Impact of the Amendments to the Nonferrous MetalsForming Regulation</ITAG>The amendment described above may affect 58 facilities in the nickel-cobaltforming and zirconim-hafnium forming subcategories. Under this amendment,tube-reducing operations would be allowed to discharge wastewater undercontrolled conditions but would not be allowed to increase that mass ofpollutants allowed to be discharged by the August 1985 regulation. Therefore,this regulation should not have any significant environmental impact. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Economic Impact of the Amendments </ITAG>The amendments do not alter the model technologies for complying with thenonferrous metals forming regulation. The Agency considered the economicimpact of the regulation when the final regulation was promulgated (see50 FR 34242). EPA concluded at that time that the regulation was economicallyachievable. Because today's amendments are based on the same model technologies,EPA's conclusions as to economic impact and achievability are unaffected.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Public Participation and Response to Major Comments</ITAG>Since proposal of these amendments two commenters have submitted commentson the proposal. These commenters are: General Electric Company and IncoInternational Alloys. The most significant of these comments are summarizedbelow:1. Both commenters generally supported the amendments proposed by the Agencyand recommended that these amendments be promulgated.2. Both commenters pointed out typographical errors in the proposal. TheAgency has made these corrections.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Executive Order 12291</ITAG>Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``major''and therefore subject to the requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis.Major rules are defined as rules that impose an annual cost to the economyof $100 million or more, or meet other economic criteria. This proposedregulation, which modestly reduces regulatory requirements, is not a majorrule.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ITAG>Pub. L. 96-354 requires that EPA prepare a Regulatory Flexibility Analysisfor regulations that have a significant impact on a substantial numberof small entities. In the preamble to the August 23, 1985 final nonferrousmetals forming regulation, the Agency concluded that there would not bea significant impact on a substantial number of small entities (49 FR 8775).for the reason, the Agency determined that a formal regulatory flexibilityanalysis was not required. That conclusion is equally applicable to theseamendments, because the amendments slightly reduce the regulatory requirements.<ITAG tagnum="84">IX. OMB Review</ITAG>This regulation was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget forreview as required by Executive Order 12291. Any comments from OMB to EPAand any EPA response to those comments are available for public inspectionat Room M2404, U.S. EPA, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460 from 9:00a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Monday through Friday, excluding Federal holidays.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 471</ITAG>Metals, nonferrous metals forming, water pollution control, waste treatmentand disposal.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: March 9, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William K.
