 For multi-user databases, fast file transfers, multivendor networks orjust a larger volume of network flow, you need bigger pipes.andP;  Ethernet is thebigger pipe of choice for most Macintosh users.andM;While Ethernet is not as simple to set up and maintain as LocalTalk, it ismuch faster.andP;  The cost for that performance has been high compared withLocalTalk, but it is becoming more reasonable, and there are several cablingalternatives that make it relatively easy to install.andM;Routers: LocalTalk to Ethernet and back.andP;  All routers physically connect atleast two networks and, with software, direct network traffic to the correctdestinations.andP;  Software Ethernet routers run on a Macintosh with at least oneEthernet card.andP;  They also run in the background; if the Macintosh they run onis used interactively, your performance can be worse, and there is anincreased chance of user error that would remove the router from the network.andO;They are especially useful for limited applications, such as accessing aLocalTalk laser printer.andM;There are now at least seven hardware routers, ranging in price from $1,495for Compatible Systems Corp.'s Ether*Route to $2,795 for a FastPath fromShiva Corp. or for Cayman Systems Inc.'s GatorBox.andP;  There are also threesoftware routers: Apple's AppleTalk Internet Router ($399), Infosphere Inc.'sLiaison ($295) and Network Resources Corp.'s MultiGate Mac ($795).andM;&quot;Generally, all I want to get to on LocalTalk is printing,&quot; said Randy Ovesonof Rude Boy Systems, a networking consulting group in Newport Beach, Calif.andO;&quot;I can just stick in a Liaison bridge and connect as many LocalTalk printersas I need to Ethernet.&quot; (See story, Page 48.)andM;Hardware routers not only offer better performance but also additionalservices.andP;  Dr. Steven Erde, technical director of the PathMAC lab at CornellMedical College in New York, is using several EtherRoutes with his200-Macintosh network because they're inexpensive.andP;  Erde added, &quot;We also willneed TCP/IP support soon, and the two LocalTalk ports are useful.&quot;andM;Du Pont, as one of Apple's biggest customers, can negotiate very favorableprices, so other issues are important.andP;  Du Pont's Imaging division in Newark,Del., uses Cayman GatorBoxes with TCP/IP support.andP;  &quot;Other boxes are good,&quot;said Bill Milles, a senior software consultant and network administrator inthe division, &quot;but the GatorBoxes can be booted remotely if the system goesdown.andP;  That's important when you have 600 Macs and 1,100 total machines onthe network.&quot;andM;The Wollongong Group Inc. recently announced its MacGateway box ($2,295),which is the &quot;no-brainer of networking,&quot; said Brian Lichorwic, a Wollongongspokesman.andP;  &quot;It configures itself like a big Ethernet card for the wholenetwork.&quot; Wollongong also sells TCP/IP and network filing system software forthe Mac, and the company hopes that customers for those products will buy itsMacGateway as well.andM;Ethernet Cards: Direct connection.andP;  &quot;LocalTalk is a fine network as long asyou only want to print and copy files every now and then,&quot; Oveson said.andP;  &quot;Butfor any graphics, large spreadsheets or multi-user databases, it's simplyinsufficient.&quot; Oveson likes to put all Macs directly onto Ethernet byinstalling Ethernet cards.andM;The cards connect Macs to Ethernet so they can be full members of an Ethernetnetwork without going through LocalTalk.andP;  There are nearly 20 vendors makingMacintosh Ethernet cards, and prices range from about $400 to $800.andP;  Thereare NuBus cards for Macintosh IIs and specific cards for SE/30s and SEs, aswell as external Ethernet boxes that plug into the SCSI port so that a Plusor Portable also can sit directly on Ethernet.andM;&quot;We have a very large network with multiple file servers with over 3 Gbytesof educational information,&quot; Erde said.andP;  &quot;For trivial file transfer, you canstay on LocalTalk, but anybody who needs access to the medical images needsan Ethernet card.andP;  A typical 150-Kbyte image can be loaded over Ethernet inone to one-and-a-half seconds.andP;  It would be a long wait through a router.&quot;andM;Case Western Reserve University of Cleveland has more than 1,000 Macs but noLocalTalk at all.andP;  &quot;About a year and a half ago, we decided to put everythinginto fiber,&quot; said Dell Klingensmith, Case director of network services.andO;&quot;Every dorm room and office has face plates with two multimode fibers, foursingle-mode fibers, six twisted pair of copper, and coaxial connections.andO;Each student, faculty member or staff member is provided with an Ethernetcard with fiber connector.andP;  All they have to do is call us up and we turn ontheir port.&quot;andM;Case is using Cabletron Systems Inc.'s E-series cards ($699) because theycome with management software that allows total control of the network.andP;  &quot;Ifthere's a problem, we can get down to the actual card from any node and turnit off,&quot; Klingensmith said.andP;  Case has become a model of large fast networks,and Klingensmith estimates that between 60 to 100 groups or companies havetoured the network during the past year.andP;  &quot;The University wanted to be on theforefront, but not out where nobody was behind us,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;There's noreason why Exxon couldn't do the same thing.&quot;andM;Other connections.andP;  Ethernet products come wired for either thick or thincoaxial cable or for both.andP;  There are several companies that also have addedtwisted-pair connections or 10BASE T. The thicker the wire, the longer themaximum network distance, but thicker cables are also more difficult to layand more expensive.andP;  10BASE T holds the promise of extremely low-cost, easilyinstalled Ethernet networks because you can use standard telephone wires in ahub configuration.andP;  A host of vendors, including Farallon Computing Inc.,andO;Technology Works Inc., Novell Inc. and Asante Technologies Inc., now have10BASE T Ethernet routers and cards.andM;The simplicity of 10BASE T wiring coupled with the decreasing cost ofEthernet cards is making Ethernet more attractive.andP;  Lower costs areimportant.andM;&quot;Users aren't screaming for Ethernet, because it costs $800 to $900 pernode,&quot; said Chris Veal, a partner and member of the networking task force ofErnst andamp; Young in San Jose, Calif.andP;  The company has no Ethernet now, but Vealthinks that might change in about a year.andP;  &quot;Ethernet with 10BASE T will bevery cheap soon,&quot; Veal said.andP;  &quot;When that happens, Mac users will start to putit in.andP;  As the competition increases and prices fall to $250 per node, theperformance gain might be worth the extra money.&quot;andM;A developer of multi-user databases, Carter Taylor of Taylor andamp; Co. inAtlanta, said, &quot;Ethernet is the ideal.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
