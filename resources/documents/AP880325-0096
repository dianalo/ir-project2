(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Surrogate mother Mary BethWhitehead-Gould has asked for twice-a-week visitation with Baby M,while the child's father wants to block all visitation, accordingto court briefs.   ``... Only a suspension of visitation will ensure that Melissais provided with a loving, supportive, nurturing and peacefulenvironment, free from interference, at the critical stages of herdevelopment,'' said Gary Skoloff, a lawyer for the girl's father,William Stern.   In legal papers released today by Superior Court Judge Birger M.Sween, Skoloff said he will present testimony at a visitationhearing Monday that will show the child's psychological welfare isat stake.   ``Indeed it is contended that the proofs will indicate that theemotional and psychological burden which Melissa will have tosustain in establishing a relationship with Mrs. Whitehead will besignificantly more damaging than any benefit which might occur toher as a result of visitation at this time,'' Skoloff said in the25-page brief.   The visitation hearing was ordered by the state Supreme Court inits landmark ruling Feb. 3 that restored Mrs. Whitehead-Gould'sparental rights while awarding custody of the baby, now known asMelissa, to Stern and his wife, Elizabeth.   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould has been allowed to see Melissa once aweek, for two hours, under supervision at a youth center here.Court papers released Thursday by Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's attorneycalled that schedule ``insufficient.''   The East Brunswick housewife, who gained notoriety by refusingto turn over the child she agreed to bear under a $10,000 contract,says in court papers that she wants her visits with the child to beexpanded eventually to half the summer and some holidays.   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould also rejected a request by Stern toterminate contact between mother and child for at least six years.She contends that a break in visitation could be harmful to thechild.   ``Mrs. Whitehead-Gould has fashioned an excellent relationshipwith Melissa and is devoted to promoting an even more flourishingand productive relationship,'' her attorney argued.   Legal briefs from both sides were filed with Sween earlier thisweek. The judge released them today after he had time to reviewthem. However, Harold Cassidy, an attorney for Mrs.Whitehead-Gould, released his brief Thursday.   ``The warm, satisfying relationship which has come intoexistence over the past two years would be lost to Melissa ifvisitation were suspended,'' Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's attorneys said.   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould requested that the visits be expandedimmediately to two days a week, eight hours each time, at her homefor the next six months.   She also requested the scheduled be expanded to allow her to seeMelissa overnight every other week, alternate weekends when Melissais 3, and half the summer and one week of Christmas vacation whenthe child is 5.   The court papers say that when Melissa is 12 she may ``voice adesire for more or less visitation.''   Skoloff has said the Sterns want to delay visitations ``as longas possible.''</TEXT></DOC>
