The major factors important tothe fabrication of these fibers are described in general terms includingsome of the issues relating to the strength and flexibility of the wires.Measurements of the three parameters which most easily characterize thesuperconducting properties of the fibers, T/sub c/, H/sub c2/, and J/subc/, are described, particularly the critical current density, J/sub c/.19 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
