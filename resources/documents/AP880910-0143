The rally was held on the eve of the anniversary of the Sept.11, 1973, military coup that crushed the Allende's electedgovernment. Allende perished during the fighting at thePresidential Palace.   Organizers said about 80,000 people attended the festive andpeaceful rally along a broad avenue in a working-class district ofthe capital. Reporters estimated the crowd at around 40,000.   The rally was called by the United Left, a seven-party coalitionthat includes the outlawed Communist Party.   Red communist flags clearly ounumbered the banners of otherparties waved by people in the enthusiastic crowd.   As a police helicopter hovered overhead the people booed andchanted, ``Murderers! Murderers!'' Police did not intervene andremained several blocks away.   Among those at the rally were several people who, like delCanto, had been ranking officials in the Allende administration.They returned to Chile after President Augusto Pinochet issued adecree 10 days ago abolishing the policy of political exile.   Pinochet, 72, is the army commander and led the coup againstAllende. His military government has ruled since the coup and he isseeking to remain in office for eight more years through apresidential referendum set for next month.   Speakers called for unity to defeat Pinochet in the referendumscheduled for Oct. 5. Pinochet was picked by himself and thecommanders of the air force, navy and national police as the onlycandidate in the referendum in which the voters will accept orreject him.   ``Without us, victory will not be possible in the referendum,''said Anibal Palma, a socialist and president of the coalition.``Without us, it will not be possible to put an end to thedictatorship and recover democracy.''   More than 100,000 people joined in an opposition rally inSantiago on Monday, but that was dominated by centrist parties andSaturday's gathering was the first to be held only by the leftistssince military rule began.   Police battled demonstrators at Monday's rally and three peoplewere killed, 21 injured and more than 1,000 detained.   On Saturday, speakers repeatedly called on the crowd to disbandpeacefully, ``avoiding violence, disturbances and provocations.''</TEXT></DOC>
