(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A British nobleman who managed abillionaire's private game preserve testified Wednesday that heknew hawks and other protected birds were being killed on theestate but denied killing any himself.   Sir Richard Musgrave, 66, the huntsman of the preserve, said henever saw any hawks killed, but he knew his gamekeepers were doingtheir jobs if they were killing the birds, which preyed onpheasants raised for hunters.   ``I've not killed a thing, sir,'' he said in U.S. District Courthere.   Musgrave also testified that he never told the owners of the850-acre Albemarle County property, businessman John Kluge and hiswife, Patricia, about the killings.   Kluge, 73, is chief owner of Metromedia, a telecommunicationsand technology holding company. Last fall, Forbes magazine listedhim as the second-richest man in America, putting his worth at $3billion.   He and his wife were not charged.   Earlier Wednesday, gamekeeper David Amos, 20, admitted killingas many as 25 hawks and owls on the preserve over the past twoyears, saying he knew killing hawks was illegal but did not realizethe seriousness of the offense.   Musgrave, Amos and fellow gamekeeper Paul Shardlow, 25, facemisdemeanor charges of conspiring to violate federal game laws. Allthree defendants are British citizens.   Musgrave owned a sporting consultant business and was hired tomanage the Albemarle County preserve. He carries the title ``Sir''because he is a baronet, a holder of a hereditary title in Britishnobility.   Amos' testimony on the trial's fifth day paralleled that ofShardlow, who told the court Tuesday that he killed about 25 hawksand owls during his two years as gamekeeper.   Under cross-examination by U.S. Attorney John Perry Alderman,Shardlow denied being ordered to kill the birds. He also said theKluges knew nothing about the killings.   Like Amos, Shardlow said he knew killing the birds was illegalbut thought it was ``equivalent to a speeding ticket.''   Asked why he killed the birds, Shardlow replied, ``To keep myjob, sir.''   If the predator birds had not been destroyed, pheasants andducks stocked at the preserve to be hunted by guests would not havesurvived and and the preserve would have been closed, Shardlow said.   The chief prosecution witness, former gamekeeper Brian Heath,has said as many as 400 hawks were killed on the preserve duringthe past two years.   Amos and Shardlow testified that Heath's estimate was much toohigh.   If convicted, Musgrave faces a maximum sentence of 3{ years inprison and a $35,000 fine. Shardlow could get 2{ years in prison ata $25,000 fine. Amos could be sentenced to a year and fined $10,000.</TEXT></DOC>
