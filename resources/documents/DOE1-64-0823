The questionof the British and French nuclear forces presented a stumbling blockduring the Geneva euro-missile negotiations. If the European industrialplutonium complex ever led to vertical proliferation on a European scale,then the situation would become inextricable at a negotiation level,and the risk of deploying tactical nuclear weapons on the European scenewould drastically increase. This holds true not only for Western Europebut also for the Eastern bloc and potentially for the United States.Likewise, the situation will worsen once the Soviet Union begins to exploitfast breeders - currently in expansion - for military purposes. Therefore,in order to limit the dangers, both production and international transfersof burnt fuel from civilian nuclear plants should be restricted, andthe transfer of plutonium should be authorized only on condition thatinternational fullscope safeguards would cover the entire fast breederfuel cycle, plutonium storage included. Mere control of the breeder reactoritself would prove meaningless, since diversion of the blanket weapon-gradeplutonium can, in principle, only be carried out at the reprocessingplant.</TEXT></DOC>
