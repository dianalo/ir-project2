Carroll (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> UIS T SUNW </CO><IN> EDP </IN><TEXT>   Unisys Corp. said it is joining American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and Sun Microsystems Inc. in their effort to develop a new standard for high-performance computers.    The announcement by Blue Bell, Pa.-based Unisys, a major manufacturer of computers that use ATandamp;T's Unix operating system -- a key software product -- marks the most significant endorsement yet for the ambitious ATandamp;T-Sun alliance.    ATandamp;T and Sun signed a technology-sharing agreement last fall calling for ATandamp;T to license Mountain View, Calif.-based Sun's design for a new microprocessor chip and for Sun to assist ATandamp;T in devising a standardized version of its Unix operating system.    Separately, Unisys confirmed it plans to announce Tuesday a long-awaited mid-range computer to bolster one of its aging lines.    The goal of the ATandamp;T-Sun alliance is to establish a new Unix version, in combination with Sun's chip, as an industry standard for machines ranging from personal to mainframe computers. Currently, different variations of the Unix operating system are widely used, making it difficult for companies to integrate their systems. An operating-system program is the software that controls the flow of data within computers.    The ATandamp;T-Sun plan emulates the standardization that International Business Machines Corp. was able to accomplish with Microsoft Corp.'s MS-DOS operating system in the personal computer arena.    To achieve its goal, Sun and ATandamp;T need other computer makers to adopt their technologies, and that's exactly what Unisys said it will do. Specifically, Unisys said it is helping ATandamp;T &quot;in significantly enhancing the commercial functionality&quot; of Unix, and licensing Sun's new chip, &quot;as the basis for future high-performance Unix system computers.&quot;    Executives close to Sun said the company plans to announce next week that at least one more computer company is joining the bandwagon with ATandamp;T.    Unisys' decision to support the ATandamp;T-Sun plan is particularly important because of Unisys' sizable role in the Unix-based computer market. Unisys garners revenue of more than $500 million a year from Unix machines, much of it in business markets, like banking and insurance, where Sun is weak. Sun sells about $1 billion a year of Unix-based machines.    &quot;This gives Sun's young management a lot more credibility,&quot; said Richard Shaffer, editor of Technologic Computer Letter, an industry newsletter. &quot;Unisys has a substantial installed base (of existing machines) and a large sales force that knows how to sell to the business market.&quot;    W. Michael Blumenthal, Unisys' chairman and chief executive officer, said in an interview that the Sun and ATandamp;T agreements are consistent with Unisys' pledge to accommodate emerging industry standards. He said customers have made it clear that they don't want to be locked into using products from only one company.    &quot;In the past, when we focused just on our own proprietary architectures, we might have had a somewhat protected market but it was a small market,&quot; he said.    Moreover, licensing Sun's new chip gives Unisys a frontier technology called reduced-instruction-set-computing, or RISC, which is supposed to enhance the power and flexibility of computers while lowering their manufacturing costs. In the past year, other computer companies like Hewlett-Packard Co. and MIPS Computer Systems Inc. have announced their own RISC-based machines.    By joining Sun and ATandamp;T -- instead of developing its own technology -- Unisys is taking a calculated risk that computer companies can rise together, instead of sinking separately.    In contrast, most other major computer makers have been extremely wary of the Sun-ATandamp;T alliance, fearing it could be a ruse to eventually force them to use standards that will never quite work as well in their machines as in those of Sun and ATandamp;T. The competitors have even formed an informal club to express their concerns over what they call the &quot;privatization of the Unix standard.&quot;    &quot;By my definition, Unisys clearly is not part of this group&quot; of concerned companies, said Mark Hatch, manager of portable software products for Chelmsford, Mass.-based Apollo Computer Inc., a Sun rival. &quot;Unisys' decision to go with (ATandamp;T-Sun) is not an indication of the feelings of the rest of the industry.&quot;    Unisys said it probably wouldn't start shipping its new Unix machines until the middle of next year.    Unisys' new mid-range computer to be unveiled next week will be a version of its 1100 line long sold by Sperry Corp., according to Mr. Blumenthal. Sperry merged with Burroughs more than a year ago to form Unisys.    Mr. Blumenthal wouldn't provide details about the new machine, but the industry source said the mid-range computer, to be called the 2200-400, will replace the models 1160, 1170 and 1180. Those models are said to account for more than half of the $14 billion of machines Unisys has sold in the 1100 family.    The new mid-range model is expected to be comparable in power to IBM's 9370 and 4381 models, and will be priced about 25% lower, in anticipation of price cuts from IBM and others in the fiercely competitive market. </TEXT></DOC>
