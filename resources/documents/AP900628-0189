The measure said the Iraqi government has ``systematicallydetained, tortured and executed'' thousands of citizens,depopulated Kurdish areas of the country and murdered and torturedchildren to punish their parents.   The fate of the bill in the Senate is uncertain. The Bushadministration has opposed the measure.   The legislation would require the United States to oppose anylending to Iraq by international financial institutions and barU.S. government credits to the country.   That would cost Iraq $200 million a year in credits through theExport-Import Bank as well as even larger amounts in loanguarantees used to buy U.S. farm products.</TEXT></DOC>
