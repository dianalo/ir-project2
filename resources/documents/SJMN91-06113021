A micron is one-thousandth of a millimeter.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  ATandamp;T, NEC IN PACTTHEY'LL DEVELOP CHIP TECHNOLOGY  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     The technology will be used for manufacturing by mid-1995, the companiessaid in a statement.;    As manufacturers pack more and more components ontoeach tiny semiconductor chip, the size of the circuits and parts on each chiphas to be reduced and the costs of developing the manufacturing technologygrows.;    The circuits are etched on the surface of semiconductors in aprocess somewhat similar to photography.;    William J. Warwick, president ofATandamp;T Microelectronics, said the agreement would allow the companies to shareresources, lower risks and develop technology more quickly.;    The agreementis to extend through Jan. 1, 1993.;    The joint development efforts will beconducted at NEC's laboratories in Japan and at the American company'sfacilities in Allentown, Pa., and Orlando, Fla., the companies said.;    Theysaid they may share products and production lines in the future based on theircommon 0.35-micron production technology.;    The two companies already have acooperative agreement in semiconductors under which NEC provides ATandamp;TMicroelectronics with application-specific integrated circuit technology, andin exchange uses the American company's semiconductors in some of itsequipment.;    NEC is the world's largest producer of semiconductors and alsomakes a wide range of computers and other electronic equipment.;    ATandamp;TMicroelectronics produces semiconductors and other electronic components andpower supplies.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Tokyo  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910422  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  11D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  269  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday April 22, 199100113021,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
