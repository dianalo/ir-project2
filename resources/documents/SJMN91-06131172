Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.;    Dorgan said he wants to scrap fast-track becauseU.S. trade negotiators &quot;promise the moon . . . but then they promptly forgettheir promises.&quot;;    Fast-track authority gives U.S. officials the power tonegotiate trade agreements with the guarantee that the pacts will not beamended by Congress. Lawmakers would have an up-or-down vote on the pacts, butGephardt said the House could technically amend an agreement's implementinglanguage if it didn't like it.;    Fast-track will remain in effect for twoyears unless it is killed by either the House or Senate by June 1.;    Dorgansaid he has 92 co-sponsors in the 435-member House for his legislation to killfast-track. But because of Gephardt's leadership position and his long-timeinterest in trade issues, his support for fast-track was viewed as importantfor the administration.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910510  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  226  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday May 10, 199100131172,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
