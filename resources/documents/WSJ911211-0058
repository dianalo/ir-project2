The dollar hit an intraday high of 1.5860 marks on anInterfax news agency report that one of Mr. Gorbachev'sprincipal advisers told young politicians &quot;you will not waitlong for Mikhail Gorbachev's departure.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   But the dollar eased after Mr. Gorbachev's spokesmandenied the report.   Late in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.5795 marks,up from 1.5711 marks late Monday in New York. The U.S.currency also was changing hands at 128.78 yen, up from128.28 yen. Sterling fetched $1.8070, down from $1.8114.   Early Wednesday in Tokyo, the dollar was trading at 128.78yen, up from Tokyo's close Tuesday of 128.32 yen, and at1.5810 marks, up from 1.5656 marks at Tuesday's close.   Bob Near, a corporate foreign exchange trader at the Bankof New York, said Tuesday that the dollar's steep gain cameprimarily because the traders had &quot;gone particularly short&quot;on dollars in Asian and European trading. The dollar hit alow of 1.5627 marks, a level not seen since March 8, when thedollar was at 1.5435 marks.   By taking a short position in a currency, a trader isbetting that it will lose value and can be repurchased atlower levels. Political events often compel purchases of thecurrency to cover the position, especially in the dollarwhich has a tradition as a haven in times of turmoil.   Mr. Near said he was somewhat surprised at the trading theGorbachev rumor inspired. &quot;It's certainly not the first timewe've heard&quot; rumors that Mr. Gorbachev would step down, Mr.Near said.   Even in the event of a Gorbachev resignation, Mr. Nearargued the impact probably would be minimal. The market wouldbuy dollars quickly, &quot;but in the absence of real turmoil&quot; orbloodshed, the resignation would soon &quot;cease to be a factor&quot;in trading, Mr. Near said.   Despite uncertainties about the Soviet situation, Mr. Nearsaid he expects the dollar to &quot;continue to ratchet down&quot; inthe coming weeks, particularly as anticipation builds for acut in interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve.   It's widely expected that the Fed will reduce the federalfunds rate, the key U.S. domestic money market rate, by 1/4percentage point to 4.25%, and the discount rate, the rate atwhich the Fed lends to commercial banks, by 1/2 percentagepoint to 4%.   Traders said speculation was in the market yesterday thatthe Fed would cut the discount rate by 3/4 percentage point.Many traders expect the Fed to make its decision at the Dec.17 to Dec. 18 meeting of the policy-making Federal OpenMarket Committee.   Although the market has been expecting lower U.S. interestrates for several weeks, Mr. Near said he is &quot;not convinced{the cut} is fully factored&quot; into current exchange rates.   Mr. Near said a move by the Deutsche Bundesbank to raiseGerman rates in December, in addition to the expected U.S.easing, could push the dollar as low as 1.5000 marks in theshort term.   And the &quot;only thing that's going to support the dollar inthe medium term&quot; is a possible package of economic proposalsexpected from President Bush in his State of the Unionaddress in January, Mr. Near added.   Judy Rubenstein, vice president at Bank of America in LosAngeles, said comments yesterday by President Bush that theeconomy needs a boost are a clue that the U.S. administrationmay be seriously planning an economic stimulus.   Mr. Bush promised to give the economy &quot;a kick,&quot; as hespoke to traders at the Chicago Board of Trade. He concededthat the economy is in a slump, but said there are &quot;someencouraging signs.&quot;   Ms. Rubenstein said she sees the dollar making a pushhigher this month. She said the dollar has the potential to&quot;slide back a bit&quot; in the next few days, but added that sheexpects the currency to push toward 1.6200 marks before yearend.</TEXT></DOC>
