RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court on Wednesday made it moredifficult for people to win lawsuits against a city governmentbased on claims that low-ranking officials violated their rights.   But the decision in a St. Louis case yielded no clear-cutmajority view and left some key questions unanswered   By a 7-1 vote, the justices threw out a $15,000 award St. Louiswas ordered to pay James J. Praprotnik, a fired city architect.   But only four of the seven justices voting to overturn the awardjoined in the court's main opinion, creating the possibility that afuture case could prompt a different result.   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who wrote the court's main opinion,said generally only the highest ranking city officials can commitconstitutional violations that make the city liable.   In the case of St. Louis, that is limited to the mayor, cityaldermen and the civil service commission, she said.   Cities may not be held liable unless those who claim theirrights were violated prove the ``existence of an unconstitutionalmunicipal policy,'' O'Connor said.   A city cannot be sued successfully based on the claim thathigh-ranking officials failed to override a subordinate's decisionthat violated someone's rights, she added.   ``Simply going along with discretionary decisions made by one'ssubordinates ... is not a delegation to them of the authority tomake policy,'' O'Connor said.   She also said that state law, and not a jury's examination ofthe facts in a particular case, determines who the policy makersare in a city.   Justice William J. Brennan, in a separate opinion, saidO'Connor's opinion ``turns a blind eye to reality'' in assuming whomakes policy in a particular community.   Brennan said O'Connor's opinion ``ultimately would permitmunicipalities to insulate themselves from liability for the actsof all but a small minority of actual city policy makers.''   Brennan's opinion was joined by Justices Thurgood Marshall andHarry A. Blackmun. Nonetheless, all three voted with O'Connor andthree other justices to throw out Praprotnik's $15,000 award. Theysaid a St. Louis official who transferred Praprotnik to a job thatled to his firing lacked policy-making authority.   O'Connor's opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H.Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White and Antonin Scalia.   Justice John Paul Stevens dissented, voting to upholdPraprotnik's lower court victory. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, whoonly recently joined the court, did not take part in the decision.   Praprotnik was a mid-level manager in St. Louis' communitydevelopment agency when in 1980 he became embroiled with hissuperiors over the proposed installation by the city of acontroversial sculpture.   Praprotnik was suspended for 15 days by a superior for havingaccepted outside employment without prior approval. But after heappealed to the city civil service commission, he was reinstatedwith back pay.   Then in 1982 he was transferred to another city agency, and hisjob responsibilities were reduced. He was fired, in what the citysaid was a budget-cutting move, on Dec. 30, 1983.   Praprotnik then sued under a federal civil rights law, charginghe was shunted to a dead-end job and then kicked out because of hisappeal to the civil service commission for his suspension back in1980.   A jury awarded him $30,000. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals reduced the amount to $15,000 while ruling he was fired forexercising his constitutional rights.   The appeals court said the city was liable, even though the juryexonerated the individual officials sued by Praprotnik.   The justices on Wednesday ordered further lower court hearingsfor Praprotnik to determine whether he still has a viable case.   In another ruling, the justices, by a 4-4 vote, ruled that anairline may be forced to continue to collect union dues fromworkers after its contract with employees has expired.   The court upheld rulings that forced Trans World Airlines tocontinue the dues check-off for replacement employees during astrike by flight attendants in 1986. TWA also was forced to collectdues from the strikers once they returned to work.   The ruling was not accompanied by any written opinion or by anyindication of how each individual justice voted.</TEXT></DOC>
