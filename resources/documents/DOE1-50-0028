Some of these taskswere hitherto performed by lateral X-ray images of the dorsal and lumbarspine, which in future might be replaced by an automatic evaluation ofthe survey scannigrams obtained by quantitative CT. The other type ofinformation needed requires quantitative measurement of the calcium saltcontents of peripheral and of central skeletal sections. Computed tomographyis the best available method for complete radiologic diagnosis of osteoporosis,not only for reasons of the medical results delivered by the method,but also for organizational and logistic reasons.</TEXT></DOC>
