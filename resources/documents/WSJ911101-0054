A Wells Fargo representative said the bank signed a letterof intent to sell the loans to Bear Stearns andamp; Co. But onefailed bidder said Bear Stearns is reselling part or all ofthe package to Apollo Advisors, an investment company headedby Leon Black, a former executive with Drexel BurnhamLambert, which arranged financing for dozens of suchbuy-outs. An Apollo spokesman declined to comment. A BearStearns official would only say that it is &quot;acting asprincipal&quot; on the deal.</LP><TEXT>   Some analysts were surprised not only by the relativelysmall discount but also by the fact that the loans sold inbulk rather than individually. They say Wells Fargo's successcould prod other banks to sell portions of their so-calledhighly leveraged transaction portfolios, which regulatorshave forced many banks to write down.   Wells Fargo has been particularly hard hit, taking a $350million charge in the second quarter mainly for reserves andlosses related to its $3.5 billion HLT portfolio. A completedsale, expected within two months, &quot;wouldn't have asignificant impact on the {fourth} quarter,&quot; a Wells Fargorepresentative said, because the bank is adequately reservedfor the discount offered in the sale.   Active trading in such loans has been slow to develop, inpart because each borrower's debt has unique characteristicsand may also involve legal liabilities that are difficult toevaluate.   So far this year, financial institutions have sold anestimated $2.5 billion of HLT loans to third parties, marketplayers say. Few banks have managed to sell off much of theirhuge portfolios of commercial real estate loans, though mostwould dearly love to. Debt traders say these credits arestill viewed as too risky because real estate values have notstabilized.   The Wells Fargo package includes loans to nine companiesthat underwent leveraged buy-outs: Revco D.S., Insilco Corp.,Charter Medical Corp., West Point-Pepperel, SpecialityEquipment Cos., SCI Television Inc., Gillett Holdings Inc.,Hillsborough Holdings Inc. and Best Products Co.</TEXT></DOC>
