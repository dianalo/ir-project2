The 110-3 vote almost ensures the legislation will take effect early next year; the Swiss upper house approved a similar measure a year ago. Minor differences could be ironed out in time for approval by both houses tomorrow, officials said. Otherwise, clearance must wait until December.    Switzerland's minister of justice, Elisabeth Kopp, would like to see the law passed before she visits the U.S. next month. During her visit she is expected to sign a U.S.-Swiss memorandum of understanding on legal assistance.    The measure calls for prison sentences of as long as three years and fines of as much as 40,000 Swiss francs ($26,000) for those who profit from or help others gain from confidential knowledge that could &quot;significantly&quot; influence the price of a stock or other financial instruments. The bill defines an insider as anyone with a special relationship to a company -- including directors, executives, auditors, public officials and their assistants. Third-party tipsters also would face prosecution.    The legislation puts Swiss insider laws more in line with those of other European countries. Switzerland currently allows the insider to go free but can punish those who profit from a tip. Meanwhile, an informal pact between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Swiss Bankers Association concerning insider-trading investigations has existed since 1982. The pact requires a customer of Swiss banks to waive secrecy rights if the customer is linked to an insider-trading case by the SEC.    Despite the new measure's strong support in both Swiss houses, legislators expressed scant enthusiasm for a law that many think has been imposed on Switzerland by the U.S.    Ms. Kopp denied that &quot;this law is 'made in U.S.A.'&quot; and said its passage was merely accelerated by U.S. complaints about Swiss slowness in providing data.    She said her ministry first proposed insider-trading legislation two years before scandals on U.S. stock exchanges focused attention on investors benefiting from Swiss banking secrecy.    However, in approving the law, the Swiss parliament stressed that investigators shouldn't get tied up in petty cases.    Under the law, violations must involve insider trading on mergers, takeovers, security issues and other important events, or a key change in a company's business status. Originally, the Swiss government wanted this point left open to encompass all possible forms of insider trading.    Swiss bankers have supported the law, expecting such moves to be inevitable.    The Social Democratic party also backed the measure, although they insisted that insider trading is an institutional fact in Switzerland, where banks engage in brokerage activities and investment banking and sit on corporate boards.    The law exists not because of &quot;the idea that insider trading is so immoral, but so that our banks don't face any disadvantage&quot; in the U.S, said Moritz Leuenberger, a spokesman for the Social Democrats.    The earliest major case of U.S.-Swiss tension over insider trading evolved in 1981 when Washington sought Swiss help in investigating alleged stock-market manipulations connected with the takeover of Santa Fe International Corp., a U.S. oil-and-gas engineering company, by Kuwait Petroleum Co. The case was resolved only when a 1985 Swiss court decree forced banks to hand over Santa Fe documents. That led to the SEC accord.    Although parliamentary approval of the new law could be challenged by a referendum if opponents gather the required 50,000 signatures, it is considered unlikely. </TEXT></DOC>
