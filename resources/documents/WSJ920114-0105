Barbara Boxer (D., Calif.) for failing toresolve what she called &quot;outrageous&quot; conflicts of interestinvolving safety inspectors monitoring railroads they may goback to work for.   Rep. Boxer, chairwoman of the House Government Activitiesand Transportation Subcommittee, said at a hearing thatdozens of FRA inspectors have re-employment rights with therailroads they monitor and should be assigned to other lines.She didn't provide any examples.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This isn't a case of the fox guarding the chicken coop,&quot;she said. &quot;It's the fox inside the chicken coop.&quot; She saidthe agency tried to correct the situation a decade ago, butdidn't follow through.   In response, FRA officials who testified at the hearingsaid that they were moving to resolve the issue. &quot;We agreethat these rights . . . do constitute an appearance of aconflict,&quot; said Grady Cothen Jr., associate FRA administratorfor safety.   FRA Chief Counsel Mark Lindsey, who appeared with Mr.Cothen, said the agency last year directed 72 employees togive up their re-employment rights, which are provided as aresult of collective-bargaining agreements between therailroads and their unions.   Of that number, he said, 16 did so, and the rest appealedto the FRA administrator, Gilbert Carmichael, who isreviewing the cases. The inspectors will be permitted toappeal Mr. Carmichael's decision to the general counsel'soffice of the Transportation Department.   But Rep. Boxer said that the last time the FRA tried toget rid of re-employment rights, the effort foundered whenthe Transportation Department's general counsel failed to acton the inspectors' appeals. The appeals went into the generalcounsel's office and &quot;disappeared,&quot; Mr. Cothen said. &quot;Noaction came out.&quot;   But the FRA officials said it was unlikely that theinspectors with re-employment rights show favoritism to theirformer employers. Because of the relatively high level ofanimosity between labor and management in the rail industry,&quot;these aren't people who are going to favor their oldemployers,&quot; said Mr. Lindsey.</TEXT></DOC>
