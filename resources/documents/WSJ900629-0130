Specifically, the researchers combined a human gene thatproduces a clot-dissolving protein with a bovine geneinvolved in milk production in cattle. When the combinedhuman-bovine genetic material was inserted into test mice,the mice began producing milk that was rich in the humanclot-dissolving protein.</LP><TEXT>   The same genetic trick is now being attempted in dairycows in hopes the cows will produce milk rich in a number ofhuman proteins of medicinal and nutritional value, saidJonathan MacQuitty, president of GenPharm International Inc.,a closely held Dutch-American biotechnology company based inMountain View, Calif., and Leyden, the Netherlands.   The significance of the new genetic trick rests inresearchers' selection of a bovine gene that could prompt theanimal, whether mouse or cow, to produce a human protein inthe milk in potentially commercial quantities.   The researchers said that in their experiment, thegenetically altered mice were producing the humanclot-dissolving protein at the rate of one to two milligramsper milliliter of milk. Had the same trick been accomplishedin a cow, the cow would produce five gallons of milk a daycontaining 20 grams of the protein.   The researchers reported their feat in the May issue ofBio/Technology, a scientific and trade journal. Theexperiment was carried out by Elizabeth Lacy and Nils Lonbergof Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York andHarry Meade and Liora Gates of Biogen Inc. in Cambridge,Mass. Mr. Lonberg subsequently went to GenPharm in MountainView which, under a license from Biogen, is extending theresearch into cattle.   In recent years, genetic engineers have talked seriouslyof having animals produce genetically engineered drugs intheir milk. The ultimate goal is for cows, nanny goats orpossibly ewes to replace the bacterial fermentation tanksthat currently produce genetically engineered drugs. So doingrequires the foreign gene that makes the drug to be&quot;expressed&quot; or turned on in the mammary tissue of the animal.   In other experiments in the past three years geneticallyaltered mice have produced foreign proteins in their milk. Inthese cases, scientists took human genes and linked them tomouse genes that function in the mouse mammary glands. Themice produced the human proteins in their milk but in amountstoo small to be commercially important.   The new trick differs in that the scientists hooked ahuman gene to a bovine gene directly involved in making milkin a cow. The bovine gene produces casein, a protein thataccounts for about a third of the total protein found incow's milk. In a move that proved to be vitally important,the researchers also plucked out the pieces of geneticmaterial at each end of the casein gene that control itsfunctioning, the so-called regulatory segments.   The research team then took the gene for human urokinaseand spliced it into the middle of the casein gene. Urokinaseis a protein, normally produced in the kidney, which candissolve blood clots. It is commercially produced by AbbottLaboratories as a pharmaceutical.   The hybrid bovine-human gene, complete with the regulatorysegments, was then implanted in mouse embryos. Three micecarrying the gene were subsequently born, one of which passedthe gene along to its progeny to create a line of inbred micewith the hybrid bovine-human gene.   The lactating females of this line of mice are producingmilk containing large amounts of human urokinase. The key tothe trick, the researchers said, was including theall-important regulatory segments with the hybrid gene.&quot;Because these bovine regulatory sequences function correctlyin mice, we assume they should be at least as effective . . .in transgenic cows,&quot; they suggested.   GenPharm's Mr. MacQuitty said researchers in theNetherlands have now used the bovine casein gene and itsregulatory segments to splice other foreign genes into theembryos of cattle.</TEXT></DOC>
