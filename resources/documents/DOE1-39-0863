In June, 1985 Saskatchewan extended its oil royalty/taxincentive program until the end of 1986. The latter part of the fiscalyear brought a dramatic 60% drop in world crude oil prices. The province,in consultation with the oil industry, developed a temporary programto help maintain oilfield employment during unstable prices. Over $1billion was spent by oil and gas companies on exploration and development.Oil production increased by 7.2% in 1985 over previous year. Land salesrevenue totalled $122.8 million. A natural gas policy announced July,1985 was designed to help achieve the goal of self sufficiency in gasproduction by early 1990s. Export gas and direct sales to new industrialprojects, are permitted under the policy. As well, the policy restructuresthe regulated pricing system for gas produced from new wells. Furtherchanges were made when the governments of Canada, Saskatchewan, Albertaand British Columbia signed the Agreement to Deregulate InterprovincialGas Markets on October 31, 1985. Natural gas drilling activity remainedstrong in 1985 with 437 wells drilled. Saskatchewan's long term objectiveto develop its heavy oil resource was achieved in part with the confirmationof a 50,000 barrel per day heavy oil upgrader. Important research inheavy oil development continued under the Heavy Oil/Fossil Fuels ResearchProgram. 16 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
