This report provides summary documentationof studies that subdivide the section into hydrogeologic units basedon their judged relative capacities for transmitting water. This particularstudy area comprises eight counties in Texas, including Swisher County.Underground patterns of rock distribution are delineated from a hydrologicperspective and at a level of detail appropriate for numerical modelingof regional ground-water flow. Hydrogeologic units are defined and characterizedso that appropriate porosity and permeability values can be assignedto each during construction of the numerical models and so that modelerscan combine units where necessary. Hydrogeologic units have been definedas mappable, physically continuous rock bodies that function in bulkas water-transmitting or water-retarding units relative to adjacent rocks.Interpretations are made primarily from geophysical logs. Hydrologiccharacteristics are assessed on the basis of properties typically associatedwith certain lithologies (e.g., sandstones are more pervious than shales)and on the basis of gross variations in effective porosity (particularlyin carbonate sequences). 15 refs., 52 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
