Since the space groups of both phases have been determinedit is possible to perform the group-theoretical analysis, in particularto find out the symmetry of the soft mode. The irreducible representationin the basis of soft-mode amplitudes inducing the structural phase transitionD/sub 4h//sup 17/ -andgt; D/sub 2h//sup 18/ is given.</TEXT></DOC>
