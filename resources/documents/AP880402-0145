President Carter considered offering $10 million in militaryspare parts for 52 Americans held hostage at the U.S. Embassy inTehran, The Miami Herald reported in Sunday editions.   However, the administration backed away from the plan afterdeciding arms dealer Houshang Lavi did not have the backing ofAbolhassan Bani-Sadr, then president of Iran, the newspaperreported.   Under the Reagan administration, the U.S. sold arms to Iran inexchange for the release of some American hostages held in Lebanon.Funds from the sale were diverted to Contra rebels at a time whensuch aid was banned by Congress.   The declassified documents, mostly Carter-era CIA and StateDepartment memos, provide the first detailed account of Carterefforts to extricate the hostages before the 1980 election, whichRonald Reagan won by a landslide.   Lavi, an Iranian-born resident of New York's Long Island, becameinvolved with the Carter administration after first contacting thecampaign of independent presidential candidate John Anderson. Thedocuments gave no indication whether the Reagan campaign wasapproached.   The documents were turned over to Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich.,chairman of the House Judiciary criminal justice subcommittee, aspart of his investigation into whether Reagan's 1980 campaign madea secret arms-for-hostages deal with Iran.   One of the CIA memos, dated Oct. 3, 1980, mentioned aconversation between an unidentified agency officer and Lavi inwhich he offered to make the hostage exchange and handed over a aseven-page list of F-14 parts.   Lavi ``wished to arrange the delivery to Iran of $8 (million) to$10 million of F-14 spare parts,'' the memo said, adding he ``wouldarrange the swap of all the hostages upon the delivery of the spareparts'' and U.S. agreement to unfreeze Iranian assets, forgiveclaims against Iran and stay out of internal Iranian affairs.   The CIA officer recommended against pursuing the offer.   The memos indicate Carter officials ended contacts with Lavi onOct. 19, 1980, after a foreign ambassador in Tehran reported thatBani-Sadr had not been aware of Lavi's offer.   WLS-TV in Chicago reported Oct. 15, 1980, that arms-for-hostagestalks were under way, and a 1984 congressional investigationconcluded the leak came from a ``highly placed member of the U.S.intelligence community'' associated with the Reagan campaign.</TEXT></DOC>
