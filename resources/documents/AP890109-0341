(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The massive securities fraud trial overWashington Public Power Supply System's $2.25 billion bond defaultofficially ended Monday with formal dismissal of the jury.   The trial had been expected to last at least a year, butout-of-court settlements with all the defendants made theproceedings unnecessary.   The 11 women and seven men on the panel had sat in court for 32days since Sept. 7 and heard 27 days of testimony from a singlewitness, a WPPSS employee who was the liaison with 88 public utilitydistricts.   Those districts had contracted with WPPSS to build the powerplants, which were abandoned unfinished in 1982. In 1983 WPPSSdefaulted on the bonds sold to finance the project.   A class of more than 24,000 bond investors and Chemical Bank ofNew York, a trustee for bondholders, sued more than 100 agencies,consultants and individuals. They charged that the defendantsconspired to lie to prospective bond buyers.   Many jurors said they followed U.S. District Judge William D.Browning's instructions against forming an opinion on the case untilthey heard all the evidence.   However, Tucson meat cutter Filiberto Islas, 53, said he was``kind of leaning'' toward the defendants, saying he heard nothingthat would indicate conspiracy or fraud.   Don Valdez, 36, a Tucson elementary school teacher, said he``couldn't really form an opinion'' based on the sole witness'stestimony.   Juror Jane Gerdes said she would have liked to deliberate averdict but felt the settlements saved the court money and gavebondholders some compensation.   ``I was thinking that if they settled, it would be financiallybetter for everybody,'' she said.   Browning told the jurors he felt the case ``would not havesettled had we not sat you down and started this trial. So yourservice here was very valuable.'' He also praised them forattentiveness to the complexities.   By the time the jury heard opening arguments, 20 defendantsremained in the trial.   With out-of-court settlements, the number had dwindled to onedefendant and the class plaintiff when the trial recessed Dec. 5 fora month.   Blyth Eastman PaineWebber Inc., the WPPSS former finanicalconsultant, ended need for continuing the trial by agreeing tosettle out of court for $25 million.   Browning still must hold hearings on the fairness of 16settlements and how the money should be distributed. Those arescheduled to be in the spring in Seattle, although a date has notyet been set.   A new trial would be ordered for the parties in any settlementBrowning might reject.   With the three other settlements worth $107 million Browning hadapproved in June, the settlements total $700 million, plus whateverthe plaintiffs can recover from $50 million in disputed insuranceclaims.   WPPSS will not pay any money as part of its settlement with theplaintiffs. The state of Washington pledged $10 million and thefederal Bonneville Power Administration, the power broker for thePacific Northwest, agreed to pay $35 million into the settlement pot.</TEXT></DOC>
