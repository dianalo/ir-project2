(``NASD'') filed withthe Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rulechange as described in Items, I, II, and III below, which Items have beenprepared by the NASD. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicitecomments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. <ITAG tagnum="85">I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substanceof the Proposed Rule Change</ITAG>The proposed amendment would modify the quantitative designation criteriafor NASDAQ National Market System (``NASDAQ/NMS'') securities containedin Part III of Schedule D to the NASD By-Laws and would add to the non-quantitativecriteria in that Part a requirement for shareholder approval of certaincorporate transactions. <ITAG tagnum="85">II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, andStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</ITAG>In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerningthe purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed anycomments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statementsmay be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD hasprepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of themost significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and StatutoryBasis for, the Proposed Rule Change The proposed rule changes would amend Parts I and III of Schedule D tothe NASD's By-Laws relating to qualification standards for NASDAQ/NMS issuers.The proposed rule changes are derived primarily out of discussions amongrepresentatives of the Commission, the NASD, certain of the registeredsecurities exchanges, and the North American Securities AdministratorsAssociation (``NASAA''), which were directed toward developing a set ofminimum quantitative and non-quantitative listing criteria that would providea basis for a uniform exemption from state securities registration requirementsfor all securities traded in markets with such listing criteria. The minimumlisting criteria and terms of the uniform marketplace exemption are setforth in a memorandum of understanding executed on March 16, 1988 by thepresidents of NASAA and the NASD. The proposed rule changes reflect theterms of the memorandum of understanding. The quantitative criteria in the proposed rule change would amend the existingNASDAQ/NMS designation criteria to make them substantially equivalent tothe criteria imposed by the American Stock Exchange prior to February 1987.The NASD believes that such levels are consistent with designating securitiesin which there is a national level of interest among investors and whichwould therefore most greatly benefit from exemption from the state registrationof securities provisions while providing sufficient safeguards to investorsto warrant such an exemption. The proposed amendment to Section 5(b) of Part III would modify the requirementsimposed upon issuers with respect to interim reports by removing the requirementthat such reports be distributed to shareholders and substituting the requirementthat such reports be made available to shareholders. The NASD notes thatmany issuers routinely distribute interim reports to shareholders but believesthat in some instances a mandatory distribution of such reports may beunduly burdensome and costly to issuers. The NASD also notes that neitherthe New York nor the American Stock Exchange require mandatory distributionof interim reports to shareholders. The NASD therefore believes that ifissuers make such reports available to shareholders upon request, the purposeof keeping investors informed will be served without undue burden uponthe issuer. The proposed new provision to Section 5 of Part III would impose upon NASDAQ/NMSissuers the requirement to obtain shareholder approval of certain significantcorporate transactions. The purpose of this proposal is to provide to shareholdersof NASDAQ/NMS issuers a greater level of participation in corporate affairsby enhancing the non-quantitative requirement for NASDAQ/NMS designationwhich were first implemented after Commission approval in August of 1987.The NASD believes that implementation of the shareholder approval requirement,is another important step in the continuing development of the NationalMarket System segment of the NASDAQ system and that such a requirementprovides further shareholder protections concomitant with the stature ofthe issuers comprising that market. Some of the registered securities exchangescurrently impose similar shareholder approval requirements. In addition,the NASD notes that the Commission, in its recent release adopting Rule19c-4, in its discussion of the possible applicability of that rule to``lock-up'' plans noted the existence of the shareholder approval requirementsof the exchanges and suggested that the NASD consider adopting a similarrule as a part of its implementation of Rule 19c-4. The proposed rule changewill accomplish this purpose. The NASD believes that the proposed rule changes are consistent with Section15A(b)(6) of the Act which requires that the NASD's rules be designed toprevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to remove impedimentsto and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and, in general,protect investors in the public interest. The NASD believes that the proposedrules protect investors and are consistent with the purposes of the Actin permitting greater participation in corporate affairs by those investors.The NASD also believes that the proposed rule changes are consistent withthe provisions of section 11A(a) (1) and (2) of the Act in that such changeswill help to assure fair competition among marketplaces and in generalwill serve to enhance the development of the national market system mandatedby Congress in that the standards will assure that issuers traded in theNASDAQ National Market System will meet quantitative criteria consistentwith the national interest in those securities and to the degree that suchsecurities are exempted from state securities registration, the proposedrule changes will serve to remove impediments to the development of a nationalmarket system in securities. The NASD also believes that the proposed rulechanges are consistent with section 19(c) of the Securities Act of 1933which seeks cooperation among the Commission and representatives of thestate governments and maximum uniformity of federal and state regulatorystandards in that the amendments should facilitate a national standardfor granting of exemptions from state securities regulation. B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition The NASD believes that the proposed rule changes do not impose any burdenon competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposesof the Act. C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the ProposedRule Change Received from Members, Participants, or Others Comments on the proposed rule changes were neither solicited nor received.<ITAG tagnum="84">III.
