Andthe study was intended to obtain data to decrease cost and increase efficiencyon energy balance by studying the promotion of efficiency on workmanshipand equipment while coordinating the preceding and succeeding manufacturingprocesses. based on the conventional manufacturing condition of a castwafer. And on casting technologies, the effect of various factors suchas solidifying speed, cooling method, heat treatment, mold configurationetc. was investigated. As a result, it was found that the solidifyingspeed and thermal history after the solidification had a great effecton a conversion efficiency. On the research and development of a continuouscasting furnace an experimental furnace of a fused metal pouring systemseparating the smelting and solidification was designed and manufactured.The furnace was to manufacture a box style ingot, and simultaneouslya graphite mold was developed also. 28 kg of the feed stock was smeltedin a quartz crucible, and was poured in a mold with a cross section of20 cm X 20 cm for solidification. By means of the operation of the furnacea good prospect for the manufacture of a low cost ingot by a large scaledpouring system was obtained. On the processing technology, in an externalconfiguration processing process, by the improvement of the casting technology,the working time per ingot was reduced to the half from about 12 hoursto about 5 hours. On the wire, reuse was tried for cost reduction. (8figs)</TEXT></DOC>
