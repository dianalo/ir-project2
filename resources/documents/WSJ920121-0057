Just yesterday, Burlington Industries Equity Inc. said itplans a $855 million initial public stock offering.Burlington, a big textile company controlled by MorganStanley andamp; Co., went private in a 1987 LBO. Other buy-outcompanies that recently filed plans to go public includelawn-care company Scott Co., conglomerate Coltec HoldingsInc. and small-appliance maker Toastmaster Inc.</LP><TEXT>   Some bigger names may be waiting in the wings. Futuregoing-public candidates, according to investment bankers,include American Standard Inc., part or all of Borg-WarnerCorp. and General Nutrition Cos.   &quot;Taking a former LBO company public is a hot topic thesedays,&quot; says Stephen Waters, an investment banker at MorganStanley. &quot;We've got folks in touch with all the major buy-outfirms.&quot;   Mark Solow, head of corporate finance at Chemical BankingCorp., says: &quot;We're starting to see a much larger number ofcompanies&quot; considering going public &quot;than we have in sometime.&quot; Other executives at Chemical say they are working ongoing-public transactions for four large corporations thathaven't yet been announced.   Last year Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., the leading LBOinvestment firm, took public four sizable companies that itcontrols, including battery maker Duracell International Inc.and glass company Owens-Illinois Inc.   This year, with the stock market at record levels, thepotential profits from taking buy-out companies public lookeven more compelling. If stock prices falter, however, theflurry of IPOs could come to a quick halt. Currently, lowerinterest rates are offering companies the chance to refinancedebt at much lower rates.   Borg-Warner, a Chicago-based security and auto-partscompany, was taken private in 1986 by a buy-out group led byMerrill Lynch andamp; Co. Borg-Warner's chief executive officer,Donald Trauscht, confirmed that Borg-Warner is considering aninitial public offering either of the entire business or ofits security division, which operates under the Wells Fargoand Burns International names.   &quot;Sooner or later, Merrill Lynch has to have an exitstrategy to give returns to its investors,&quot; Mr. Trauschtobserved. While he said there isn't any firm timetable yetfor a Borg-Warner offering, &quot;with the stock market at anall-time high, sooner is better than later.&quot;   American Standard, meanwhile, is likely to put&quot;significantly more equity on the balance sheet,&quot; predictsMariel Clemensen, head of junk-bond research at ShearsonLehman Brothers Inc. The plumbing and air-conditioningcompany was taken private in 1988 in a $3 billion buy-out ledby Kelso andamp; Co.   Fred Allardyce, American Standard's chief financialofficer, is coy about his intentions. &quot;At some point, we maybe a publicly held company,&quot; Mr. Allardyce says. He saysthere aren't any current plans to sell stock to the public;he won't say when that might change.   Investment bankers and analysts speculate that investmentbank Morgan Stanley, which controls a wide assortment ofindustrial companies through its buy-out funds, may want totake more of them public this year. Morgan Stanley alreadyhas filed stock offerings for Coltec and Burlington; twofuture candidates, analysts say, are Fort Howard Corp. andContainer Corp., both paper and packaging companies. A MorganStanley spokeswoman declined to comment.   Another private company that investment bankers considerlikely to go public is General Nutrition. Last October, itfiled plans to sell $100 million of stock, but postponed itsoffering in December after the stock market stumbled briefly.   Stocks currently are selling at an average 23 timesper-share earnings for the previous 12 months. Such loftyvaluations have been seen only twice before in the past 35years -- for brief stretches in 1961 and 1987, according toGoldman Sachs andamp; Co. portfolio strategist Steven Einhorn.   As a result, some investment bankers are even hoping thatlong-time closely held companies might be coaxed into sellingstock to the public for the first time.   But companies such as Cargill Inc., Hallmark Cards Inc.,Mars Inc. and United Parcel Service of America Inc. say theydon't have any plans to sell stock to the public --regardless of how high a valuation they might be able tocommand in the current stock market.   &quot;We're probably the last company you should ask,&quot; saysKent Nelson, chief executive of United Parcel. &quot;We have arich tradition of being owned by our active employees. We'venever talked seriously about going public in my 32 years atthe company.&quot;   Executives at Cargill Inc., the largest private company inthe U.S., with about $54 billion in annual sales, are evenmore adamant about staying that way. Says Garland West, avice president at the Minneapolis-based trading company:&quot;We'll go public the week after snowballs form in hell.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
