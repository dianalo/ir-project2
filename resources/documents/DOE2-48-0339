This does not mean that screening is the main problemin processing technology; it can be said, however, that screening hasto accomplish an essential function. Successful separation on processingmachines, such as jigs or HMS, often substantially depends on previousaccurate screening. Grading of washed coal also demands high screeningaccuracy. Blinding of screens caused by grains which have got stuck inthe mesh openings and are not discharged either to the top or to thebottom by the machine acceleration, constitutes an essential problemin screening. Moist and gluey material, especially such of high fine-graincontent, smudges and obstructs the screen openings. Important criteriaof screening difficulty are: - content of grain size between mesh widthand half mesh width; - moisture; - content minus 100 {mu}m (150 mesh),especially for moisture; - loamy and clayish components. This problemhas gained in importance in the last decade due to new mining methodsand extracting equipment which have constantly increased the moisturecontent of raw coal. The intensifying competition calls for rationalizationmeasures in the light of plants demanding not much personnel, maintenanceand cleaning. Modern machines have to comply with these requirements.</TEXT></DOC>
