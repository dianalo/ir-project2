<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-43-0657 </DOCNO><TEXT>Highlights two technological schemes for selective coal cutting by meansof large-capacity hydraulic excavators applied at the Bogutovo Selo brown-coalsurface mine. Longitudinal and perpendicular blocks were cut, and theinfluence of this excavating technology on coal quality and utilizationof mining equipment was investigated. Combined use of excavators andbulldozers resulted in satisfactory excavation of inclined coal seams.Waste intercalations thicker than 0.7 m may be excavated selectivelyin a 22-26 m thick coal seam. Coal layers thinner than 0.7 m should beexcavated simultaneously with overburden or waste intercalation and sentto spoil banks in order to keep costs within tolerable limits. 5 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
