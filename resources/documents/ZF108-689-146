 There were bit-mappedfonts for screen display and dot-matrix printer output, and PostScriptoutline fonts for output to LaserWriters or Linotronics.andP;  Bit-mapped fontswere commonplace, and PostScript fonts were available from only a fewvendors.andP;  Now, jargon like &quot;Type 1,&quot; &quot;Type 3&quot; and &quot;TrueType&quot; litters thatpreviously clean landscape, provoking fears about compatibility and confusingbuyers.andP;  However, the situation is actually getting better, not worse, as newtechnologies solve earlier problems and the overall quality of Mac typeimproves.andM;In this review, we look at Mac fonts -- where they come from, how they workand what to look for when buying them.andP;  Almost 60 vendors now produce outlinefonts for the Mac.andP;  Many more produce bit-mapped fonts for dot-matrixprinters.andP;  But this distinction has become blurred with the introduction ofAdobe Type Manager (ATM) and the coming of Apple's TrueType.andP;  Here, we focuson high-quality outline fonts.andM;Where do typefaces come from?andP;  Typeface designs come from many sources.andP;  Someare new, original designs.andP;  Some are revivals of old faces that are now inthe public domain.andP;  Some are derivatives or a particular designer's style ofold faces.andP;  And some typefaces are licensed by vendors from other typefoundries.andM;No copyright protection exists for typeface designs themselves; only typefacenames and the computer code that generates character outlines can beprotected.andP;  So to use the name &quot;Helvetica,&quot; it must be licensed from thetrademark holder (in this case, Linotype Co.).andP;  However, if a type foundrywishes to release a similar design and call it something else, it may.andP;  Themany similar designs from different vendors dictate a close inspection of thequality of their renderings when choosing a font.andM;There are many players in the typeface game, and not all sell directly to endusers.andP;  Vendors also license technology and typeface names and designs toeach other, making things doubly confusing.andM;One often-mentioned player in the type-licensing game is InternationalTypeface Corp.andP;  Its library includes original faces, revivals of older facesand typeface designs licensed from other type foundries.andP;  ITC was set up as atypeface clearinghouse and does not do in-house type design, but commissionsand licenses work from outside designers, develops weights and extendedcharacter sets, then licenses these typeface designs and names to typesettingequipment manufacturers, such as Agfa Compugraphic (a division of Agfa Corp.)andO;and Linotype, and to type foundries, such as Adobe Systems Inc. and BitstreamInc.andP;  ITC does not sell to end users.andM;URW, another large type foundry, also does not sell directly to end us-ersbut licenses faces to other found-ries, such as The Font Company and DigitalTypeface Corp.andP;  In addition to licensing its library, URW will digitizetypefaces for other type found-ries, using its IKARUS software.andM;Adobe's type library consists of typefaces that have been licensed from suchfoundries as Linotype, ITC and others, as well as original typeface designs.andO;The Adobe type library is also licensed to other companies such as Agfa,Linotype and Monotype Typography Inc.andP;  In this arrangement, the reseller doesnot modify Adobe's faces, although they may be repackaged.andP;  Most of thesecompanies also market typefaces from their own libraries, which do notduplicate those in the Adobe library, giving the manufacturer's customers asingle source for typefaces.andM;How type works on the Mac.andP;  PostScript fonts come with two kinds of files.andP;  Abit-mapped font is used for screen display or dot-matrix printing, and anoutline font is used for printing to a PostScript device.andM;Apple's original scheme for identifying which font the user specifiedrequired a unique ID number for each typeface.andP;  Unfortunately, Apple's methodonly allowed for 255 ID numbers.andP;  As typefaces proliferated on the Mac,font-ID conflicts became a major headache for end users and service bureausalike (see MacInTouch, May 17).andP;  Thankfully, this problem has been alleviatedfor the most part by a new numbering scheme that allows for more than 32,000ID numbers and by new rules for identifying fonts by name rather than bynumber.andP;  Wrong fonts still occasionally crop up as a result of namingconflicts, but it is much less of a problem with current technology.andM;There are two kinds of Post-Script outline fonts, Type 1 and Type 3, and theyhave some important differences.andP;  These differences are largely invisible tothe casual user.andP;  The most obvious distinction is that most Type 1 fonts willwork with ATM and Type 3 fonts will not.andP;  To the expert user, however, theType 1 format is preferable to Type 3 for several reasons:andM;andgt;It results in smaller files.andM;andgt;It includes mechanisms for &quot;hinting&quot; that optimize character shapes at lowresolutions.andM;andgt;It's faster.andM;andgt;Its fill routines are more accurate.andM;Until recently, Type 1 was a proprietary Adobe format licensed to only aselect group of large found-ries; with the publication of the Type 1specification, however, many vendors are releasing Type 1 ver-sions of theirfonts.andM;However, this does not mean that Type 3 fonts are obsolete.andP;  Type 1 cannothandle stroked or very complex characters, and it is possible for Type 3fonts to be hinted.andM;Other font formats.andP;  There are other outline printer font formats besidesPostScript.andP;  GCC Technologies Inc.'s PLP II, PLP IIS, WriteMove andWriteImpact printers all use a proprietary outline format.andP;  GCC'sprinter-driver software converts outline data into an appropriate bit map fortransmission to the printer.andP;  These font outlines have been licensed fromBitstream Inc., and the format is based on Bitstream's Type F format.andO;Bitstream Type F fonts can be run through the MacFontware Converter,available from GCC, to put them into GCC's proprietary format.andP;  A bit-mappedversion of each font is still required for screen display on the Mac.andM;Hewlett-Packard Co.'s Desk-Writer, PaintWriter, PaintJet and PaintJet XL useAgfa Compugraphic's Intellifont outline-font technology.andP;  Intellifont isbuilt into the printer-driver software and works with the DeskWriter Seriesfonts from Agfa.andP;  Again, bit-mapped fonts must be installed for screendisplay, and the PaintJet printers also require that HP's Color PrintKitsoftware be installed.andM;With the release of ATM, these GCC and HP printers and other non-PostScriptprinters, such as Apple's LaserWriter IISC and ImageWriters, can also usePost-Script outline fonts.andP;  In addition to opening the PostScript Type 1 fontmarket to non-PostScript printers, ATM also offers the advantage ofhigh-quality screen rendering of fonts, a feature not available with theMacFontware and Intellifont technologies as they are implemented on theseprinters.andM;Choosing a typeface.andP;  Typefaces fall into three basic categories: text facesused for body copy; display type used for large sizes and decorativepurposes; and special-purpose symbol fonts for applications such as math,music, science and mapping.andM;Assuming you have chosen a type family for your project -- ITC Galliard, forexample -- how do you then choose which version to buy?andP;  Several vendorssupply the face, each with slightly different features.andM;Important criteria in choosing a typeface and supplier are:andM;andgt;Whether you must exactly match type used in an existing publication.andM;andgt;Whether the type family includes all the weights and styles needed (light,regular, bold, italic and so on).andM;andgt;Whether the font is in Type 1 format so that it is hinted for best-quality300-dpi output and is compatible with ATM.andM;andgt;The quality and quantity of kerning pairs.andM;andgt;Whether any special symbols needed are included.andM;Trueness of cut (how well an implementation of a face matches an originalstandard) may be an important issue if you need to match typefaces that wereused in the past for similar projects.andP;  Probably the most important thing tobe aware of is that matching fonts from different manufacturers are notguaranteed to have the same metrics (in other words, to generate the sameline endings).andM;A variety of type weights adds tremendously to the versatility of a typefamily.andP;  To add interest to a page without adding the potential visualconfusion of another typeface of a different design, it's often useful to usedifferent weights of a single typeface to distinguish functions of particularparts of the copy.andP;  Sans-serif faces such as Avant Garde, Helvetica andUnivers usually are available in the widest range of weights, typicallylight, regular, medium and bold, but often with ultralight and ultrabold orheavy added to the ends of this range.andP;  Of the large type foundries,Bitstream generally offers the widest range of weights for a given typefamily.andM;Italics are used primarily as an auxiliary to Roman typefaces but are alsouseful as primary typefaces.andP;  So, purchasing a type family with an italicthat's distinctively different in shape from the Roman (as opposed to simplya slanted Roman) will stretch your type dollar and look more professional.andO;Italics come in a variety of forms, from the merely oblique, typical ofsans-serif faces, to modified sloped Romans, typical of faces such as Meliorand Trump Mediaeval, to true cursive italics, typical of faces such asGalliard.andM;Hinting gives the printer extra information about the shape of each characterto help it make intelligent decisions about which printer dots to turn on forthe best possible rendering of that character.andP;  Hinting is particularlyimportant at small text sizes on low-resolution (300-dpi) devices.andP;  Withouthinting, small type will tend to have an uneven appearance; some of thestrokes may be wider than others when they should all be the same width.andO;Hinting is not necessary at large sizes (more than 24 points) or onhigh-resolution devices for any type size.andM;Fonts from Adobe, Monotype and Treacyfaces Inc., among others, are hinted andin Type 1 format for use with ATM.andP;  Bitstream and The Font Company also shipType 1-format fonts but without hinting; these fonts are intended for use onhigh-resolution devices at 1,000 dpi or greater, but 300-dpi output issuitable for proofreading.andM;Kerning is the adjustment of space between pairs of letters such as &quot;To&quot; and&quot;WA.&quot; Typically, kerning tightens the spacing between such pairs so theydon't look like they're floating apart, but there are also character pairsthat need to be loosened.andP;  Some typeface designs require more kerning thanothers for an even appearance that enhances readability.andP;  Kerning is alsomore important at larger type sizes.andM;But the critical point about kerning-pair information built into a font isn'thow many kerning pairs there are; it's how well they've been designed.andO;Several applications are available that allow you to adjust the kerning-pairdata in your fonts or use predefined kerning-pair tables (see MacWEEKcomparison, Dec.andP;  12, 1989), and page-layout packages often let you adjustkerning pairs on the fly.andP;  Bitstream, The Font Company and Treacyfaces areknown for the quality and quantity of kerning pair data included in theirfonts.andM;Special characters, such as fractions, old-style and proportionally spacedfigures, and de-signed small caps, are most important in book typesetting,and are included in expert collections from Adobe and Monotype.andP;  Swashes anddecorations are also available in alternate character sets.andP;  EmDash,NeoScribe International and Page Studio Graphics sell fraction fonts matchingsome of the built-in PostScript fonts.andM;Conclusions.andP;  In choosing Mac type, look carefully at both the rendering ofthe face and the manufacturer's reputation.andP;  Also consider whether thespecial features available in the family meet your project's needs.andP;  Type 1fonts are usually preferable to Type 3.andM;An excellent resource in the quest for the right font is your local servicebureau.andP;  Typesetting service bureaus tend to have a broad range of experiencewith typefaces from many manufacturers and can warn you of problems they'veexperienced in working with them.andP;  Your service bureau also may be able torefer you to expert advice on design and choosing typefaces.andP;  And when it'stime to make that critical decision, consider running test prints there toanticipate problems before it's too late to solve them.andM;Matthew Carter, Lowell Halvorson, Lance Hidy, Mike Parker, Louis Rosenblum,Kathleen Hinkle and Joe Treacy provided background material for this article.andM;In choosing a typeface, you must be able to examine printed samples,preferably ones that include at least a full uppercase and lowercase alphabetfor each font.andP;  A complete specimen book also includes ragged-right ratherthan justified settings of text type at several different sizes that show thetype's color (the shade of gray that a block of copy will assume on thepage), and alphabets at several text and display sizes.andP;  An indication of theface's set width is helpful for identifying which fonts will set wider ornarrower than others.andM;Beyond the usual free marketing literature, several font manufacturerspublish catalogs that present more-complete information.andP;  The Adobe TypeGuide ($20) shows a complete character set as well as a 10-point text samplefor an indication of type color.andP;  The catalog covers the entire Adobe typelibrary through package 123 (Tekton).andP;  Adobe's Font andamp; Function, a freequarterly catalog, is unique in that it also shows some of Adobe's typefacesin use, offering useful design ideas and showing fonts in a more attractivelight than straight alphabet listings do.andM;The Font Company's catalog is $9.95, which is credited to your first fontorder.andP;  Unfortunately, the listings are one-liners that don't include a wholealphabet, so typeface identification must be done with the help of someoneelse's specimen book.andM;Image Club Graphics Inc.'s Typeface Catalog is $5, or free with a fontpurchase.andP;  It shows complete uppercase and lowercase alphabets, numerals andspecial characters for each font.andP;  There's also a short text setting for anindication of type color.andM;The MacTography Type Sampler is a catalog of nearly 3,500 typefaces from 32companies, all for sale through MacTography.andP;  The book is $75, plus $80 forone year of updates.andP;  Listings for each font include a complete character setand a text setting.andP;  We wish the book was in a smaller format, but weappreciate the easy-to-update loose-leaf binder.andP;  MacTography is aninvaluable cross-reference and buyer's guide.andM;The Communications Company Inc. publishes The WYG (What You Get) Guide($14.95), the first in its series of PostScript typeface specimen books.andO;Type samples are of Adobe fonts through package 16 (Melior).andM;Each font's listing is composed of complete uppercase and lowercasealphabets, numerals, and some punctuation and special symbols.andP;  Both settingsinclude a swatch of reversed type.andP;  This is hardly an exhaustive guide toMacintosh PostScript typefaces, but it includes examples of 300-dpi vs.andO;2,540-dpi gray-tint screens with reversed and surprinted rules and type, andcomplete character sets and keystrokes for Adobe's pi fonts.andM;FontShop USA Inc. publishes its type offerings of more than 1,300 fonts in abeautifully designed catalog for $24.95 (free with a font purchase of $149),including updates for one year.andP;  FontShop sells fonts from companies such asAdobe, Agfa Compugraphic, Letraset and Monotype, as well as those fromsmaller, harder-to-find companies such as EmDash, Emigre Graphics, The FontBureau Inc. and NeoScribe.andP;  The catalog doesn't show a complete character setfor each font but includes a text setting to show color and the typefacedesign.andP;  The book is small and loose-leaf-bound, so it is easy to use andupdate.andM;The Communications Company Inc. is located at 6401 Pontiac Drive, Indian HeadPark, LaGrange, Ill.andP;

 Choosing the right incremental version of theMacintosh system software is almost like a game of roulette.andP;  The Mac hasgrown so complex that there are thousands of variables, and Apple itselfcontrols only a few of them.andP;  Depending on what mix of hardware and softwareyou have, one version of the system software may crash frequently whileanother works fine.andM;Varying recommendations from different groups at Apple have contributed tothe confusion.andP;  An &quot;AppleGram&quot; recommended using Version 6.0.4 for certainmachines, although Apple is shipping 6.0.5 with all new Macs.andM;In the confusion of choices and information, there is one approach that canhelp bring order to the desktop.andP;  In the world of large computers, it isoften termed &quot;change management.&quot;andM;Your starting point is the new Mac at the time of purchase, with the systemsoftware included in the package.andP;  Hardware and software changes should beapplied systematically to that base from the time the computer is new.andM;For example, if you are starting with System 6.0.2 on a Mac II and need toupgrade to 32-bit color, Apple recommends installing System 6.0.5 (seeMacWEEK, April 3).andP;  First, upgrade only the system software (paying attentionto the heap-size issue covered in Mac-WEEK, June 19) and then attack anyproblems that develop.andP;  Don't install a slew of Startup documents (INITs),virtual-memory software, desktop video and LaserWriter 6.0 at the same time.andO;Instead, work component by component, leaving a few days to shake outproblems from each change.andM;If your Macintosh is working OK with System 6.0.2 or higher, there is noreason to upgrade until you install hardware or software that requires anewer version.andP;  (Of course, certain bugs may necessitate upgrading to get thefix, such as the Apple File Exchange bug with dual-floppy SEs, which wasfixed in System 6.0.5.)andM;Apple recommends that all Macs (Mac Plus and newer) use at least Version6.0.2, since the original 6.0 release had many compatibil-ity problems.andO;(System 6.0.1 was never released.)andM;System 6.0.5 is required only for the Mac IIfx, although Apple alsorecommends it for use with the Portable and IIci and with 32-bit QuickDrawapplications.andP;  Systems 6.0.2, 6.0.3, 6.0.4 and 6.0.5 can be used together onthe same network.andM;Going backward in versions is generally a bad idea.andP;  No system software olderthan that originally shipped with the machine should ever be used.andP;  Applealso recommends against using the Installer's Remove button to attempt toreturn to an earlier version of the system.andP;  If you must go back to an olderrelease because of insurmountable problems, you should restore the softwarefrom a backup.andP;  Failing that, you can delete the System files and re-installthe software from scratch, using locked Apple System disks at the desiredrelease level.andM;The secret of success is not to fix anything that isn't broken.andP;  That, alongwith systematic change management and Apple's latest system change historydocuments (available on AppleLink or from dealers) should help keep confusionin check until Apple develops an installer with more artificial intelligence.andM;More gremlin tricks.andP;  In our recent discussion of the Mac II-familyserial-port &quot;gremlin&quot; (see MacWEEK, July 10), we missed a simple solution tothe problem, according to readers who subsequently wrote in with the tip.andM;Jeff Lee at NASA in Wallops Island, Va., and David Ulrich of Royal GlassCorp. of Englewood, N.J., used the standard Apple ImageWriter driver to fixthe problem when it occurred.andP;  Selecting the ImageWriter in the Chooser andswitching back and forth between the printer port and modem port apparentlyresets the critical area of parameter RAM, zapping the gremlin.andM;We welcome comments at MacWEEK, 4 Cambridge Center, Third Floor, Cambridge,Mass.andP;

 For example, you can purchase the Bitstream Typeface Library onhard disk for $19,995, and many other vendors will sell their libraries inthat format.andM;The distribution scheme that makes the most sense right now is CD-ROM, andthree manufacturers -- Agfa Compugraphic, Image Club Graphics Inc. and NECTechnologies Inc. -- have released type libraries in this format.andP;  Image Clubsells its own library, Agfa offers both its own typefaces and the Adobelibrary, and NEC OEMs the Adobe library.andM;You can purchase each vendor's whole library or, through a special decryptingprocedure, purchase only those typefaces that you need.andP;  This method makes iteasy to create a type collection at your own pace with a maximum ofconvenience.andP;  When you wish to buy a font, you call the company with a listof typefaces to purchase and are given an electronic &quot;key&quot; that makes thosefonts visible on the disc.andM;All three companies use the same application to unlock typefaces: a simpleControl Panel device (cdev) developed by the AND Group of Calgary, Alberta.andO;We used this program with NEC's Type Gallery CD-ROM and found it simple touse.andP;  Once the keys have been entered, the fonts will be unlocked on the CDas long as the cdev is present.andP;  The only concern is ensuring that you have abackup of the cdev (which saves the keys you have entered) in the event yourhard drive crashes.andM;Pricing for the initial purchase of the different CD-ROMs is varied.andP;  The NECCD sells for $399 and includes purchase of three typeface families; theunlocked disc with the entire library and a CD-ROM drive is $10,999.andP;  Agfa'sCD-ROM is priced at $169 with one typeface family included; $975 for thedisc, 20 font families and a CD-ROM drive; and $16,995 for a package thatincludes a drive and the entire Adobe and Agfa libraries.andP;  Image Club'sCD-ROM is priced at $199 and includes 20 typefaces (10 of which are prechosenby the company) and one volume of clip art; the unlocked disk is availablefor $5,399 with a CD-ROM drive.andM;If you are looking to acquire an entire type library and gain increasedprinting performance, Adobe's Font Folio is a good option.andP;  Font Folio is an80-Mbyte hard drive that connects to the SCSI port of a PostScript peripheraland comes in two versions.andP;  Font Folio 1 contains Adobe typeface packages 1to 69 and sells for $9,600.andP;  Font Folio 2 contains packages 1 through 105 andis priced at $14,200.andM;For backup purposes, as well as for use with Adobe Type Manager (ATM), Adobeincludes floppy disk versions of the library as well.andP;  If you wish to keepcurrent with the Adobe Type Library after purchasing Font Folio, Adobe offersa subscription service that will automatically send you the company'stypefaces as they are released.andP;  Font Folio also includes Fifth GenerationSystems Inc.'s Suitcase II utility.andM;Currently, there are only a few printers that support the Font Folio, such asApple's LaserWriter IINTX, GCC Technologies' Business LaserPrinter and QMSInc.'s PS-820 Turbo, but users of those machines will be able to detect aspeed improvement of 15 percent to 20 percent when printing.andP;  This speedimprovement becomes especially pronounced when printing long, complexdocuments that use downloadable fonts.andM;The one complaint we have about Font Folio is with the floppy disk backup.andO;Adobe should either offer the library in a different Mac storage medium, suchas CD-ROM, or on another hard disk.andP;  This would make using the Font Foliomuch more convenient, especially with utilities such as ATM.andM;If you have a printer that can accept a SCSI drive but do not want to investin an entire library, most SCSI hard drives sold today will work properly.andO;(Many early SCSI drives will not work, mainly because of the way that theSCSI standard was implemented.) Even a 20-Mbyte disk will give you enoughroom for a wide number of typefaces and speed improvements.andP;  -- By RickLePageandM;Digital type is considered to be typeset quality at 1,200-dpi printerresolution.andP;  At this resolution, printer dots are small enough and there areenough of them that characters can be well-rendered by translating outlinesdirectly into dot patterns, without using hinting.andP;  On low-resolutiondevices, it's another story entirely; printer dots are relatively large, andthere are fewer available to render characters.andP;  This makes the choice ofwhich dots to turn on critical to the legibility of a character.andP;  Type 1PostScript fonts are hinted to improve their rendering on low-resolutionoutput devices.andM;Macintosh screen or bit-mapped fonts are designed for 72-dpi resolution.andP;  Forapplications that are accomplished entirely on-screen, such as formscompletion, the most-legible fonts will be simple in design, reasonably largein size (10 points minimum), and have complete bit maps for bold and italicstyles.andM;We've found that fonts designed for dot-matrix printing, such as Geneva andNew York from Apple and Boston II (shareware), are easier to read on thescreen than PostScript font bit maps.andM;These hand-tuned bit maps produce the best possible rendering of a font at agiven size and resolution.andP;  It's much easier for the human eye to make thesubjective judgments necessary when creating a bit map, particularly at smallsizes, than it is to build that kind of intelligence into a computer programsuch as Adobe Type Manager (ATM).andM;The major disadvantage of depending entirely upon hand-tuned bit maps forfonts is that a separate bit map is required for each size and style of thetypeface, at the expense of a lot of hard disk space.andP;  However, ATM providesa full range of screen font sizes for Type 1 PostScript fonts, whiledot-matrix fonts typically are supplied in only six or seven point sizes.andO;ATM works best at 14 points and larger, so hand-tuned bit maps are stillneeded for small sizes.andM;Some typefaces will never render well at low resolution, specifically faceswith subtle design characteristics and shallow curves.andP;  Simpler designs withstraight serifs or lacking serifs are better-suited for this environment.andM;Non-PostScript printers that require a bit-mapped font for printing needdouble-, triple- or quadruple-size fonts to print properly; the size isdependent on printer resolution.andP;  These bit maps can be generated on the flyby ATM.andP;  (Note that not every Type 1 font is ATM-compatible; ask themanufacturer.)andM;Fax machines require triple-size bit maps for the best-quality digitaltransmission.andP;  The fax environment is a particularly hostile one, so theissue of typeface design is even more critical than it is with otherlow-resolution devices.andP;  Digitally transmitted faxes contain the cleanestimages because they come directly from the Mac.andP;  Scanned faxes tend to losefine details in type, such as very thin strokes and serifs.andP;  Retransmittedfaxes are even further degraded.andM;In general, stick with faces that are highly legible, have open counters(spaces inside letters), and don't have a great deal of contrast betweenthick and thin strokes.andP;  ITC Lucida and Stone Sans from Adobe, and BitstreamCharter hold up well in this environment.andP;  -- By Mary Jane Westland</TEXT></DOC>
