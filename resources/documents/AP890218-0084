Signs of insider trading on takeover stocks have been noticed byseveral ticker-tape scrutinizers.   Also, in the past week, Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., one of the Street'sbiggest investment firms, abandoned a suspension of computerizedprogram trading, blamed by many investors for wild price swings instocks and mentioned by some studies as a catalyst in the Oct. 19,1987 crash.   Insider trading and program trading were prominent in the5-year-long bull market that collapsed on Black Monday. A crackdownon securities fraud and post-crash limits on program trading by bigbrokerages pushed those two activities into relative obscurity for awhile.   Although market officials responsible for policing trades haven'tdisclosed a resurgence of insider trading, irksome signs of theactivity _ particularly in takeover-target stock prices _ have beengetting more frequent.   ``My impression is the stocks are very definitely running upprior to bids,'' said Charles M. LaLoggia, author of SpecialSituation Report, a widely read newsletter that focuses on takeoverstocks.   ``It's just the sort of environment we saw in 1986 and 1987 allover again,'' LaLoggia said. ``Apparently, it's insider trading. Forsome reason, I'd say over last three or four months, there'sdefinitely been an upsurge.''   One of the most conspicuous moves lately was in Coleman Co., therecreational equipment maker. That usually sleepy stock jumped invalue days before management disclosed plans last Tuesday for adebt-financed takeover.   In another questionable predisclosure move, the value of UnionCarbide Corp. stock shot up a week before the chemical giantannounced it had settled the Bhopal gas-leak disaster case with theIndian government. In addition, there have been recurring rumors ofa possible takeover bid for Carbide.   New York Stock Exchange surveillance officials declined to returntelephone calls for comment on possibly suspicious trades. Jay Bono,head of the American Stock Exchange's surveillance unit, said hisstaff had not detected any significant resurgence in pre-takeoverannouncement stock moves.   ``Things are hopping, but there's definitely no greater incidenceof evidence of insider trading,'' he said.   Some of the activity could be attributed to the Wall Street rumormill, which is running overtime as usual. Rumors on possibletakeover attempts abound, and traders can't afford to ignore thereports, regardless how factual, for fear of missing another RJRNabisco.   To be sure, many investment professionals believe the stockmarket's situation today differs sharply from the careless precrashdays. For one thing, prices still remain depressed relative to thattime. For another, they say, higher corporate profits and dividendshave justified the market's resurgence.   ``My feeling is, investors aren't getting into the 1987-typetrap,'' said Rao Chalasani, a market strategist at Prescott Ball andamp;Turben Inc., a Cleveland-based investment firm. Nonetheless,Chalasani said, Morgan Stanley's resumption of program tradingraised troubling questions.   The strategy involves the simultaneous sale of massive amounts ofstock in New York and purchase of stock-index futures in Chicago toprofit from price differences, and can jolt prices regardless ofunderlying values.   ``I do have some concern about the orderliness of the market andhow orderly it will be,'' Chalasani said. ``Anything that's affectedthe market in the past could do so again in the future.''   In other business and economic news this past week:   _General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. reported record profitsfor 1988 but the performance was tainted by heavy costs for rebatesand generous credit deals to customers.   _Foreign crackdowns on fraudulent market activities accelerated.French authorities indicted five people on insider trading charges,Mexican prosecutors arrested four top securities brokers, andJapanese police seized a former Labor Ministry aide implicated in asensational stock scandal.   _Government statistics suggested the nation's trade-balanceimprovement has stalled although the economy continues to showconsiderable strength. The December trade deficit shrank onlyslightly, January industrial output climbed and factory utilizationremained the highest in nearly a decade.</TEXT><NOTE>End adv weekend editions Feb. 18-19.</NOTE></DOC>
