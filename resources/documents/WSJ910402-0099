In the union's first court-run, more democratic election,an election officer has so far certified 840 of the 1,942delegates being picked by local members for the Junenominating convention in Florida. R.V. Durham, a vicepresident backed by the retiring incumbent, claims nearly 80%of delegates to date; many aren't formally committed. But hecould lose some support to candidate Walter Shea, a formerstaff man.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Durham last week won 11 delegates by a 2-to-1 marginin Kernersville, N.C., stopping a bid by New Yorker RonaldCarey to embarrass Mr. Durham at his home local. Mr. Carey,backed by dissident Teamsters, is a vigorous campaigner andclaims over 200 delegates. William Genoese, head of theairline division and a newcomer to the race, insists it's&quot;wide open.&quot;   It takes only 5% of the delegates' votes to get on theDecember election ballot, but the delegate count shows acandidate's strength.                                                                                                          A NEW IDEA for more investing options gains employers'favor.   A Labor Department proposal would exempt overseers ofretirement plans that let workers make investment decisionsfrom fiduciary responsibility only if three or more options,such as equity funds or guaranteed investment contracts, areoffered. Switches must be allowed quarterly. &quot;It's a win-winsituation&quot; for managers and workers, says Dow Jones treasurerLeonard Doherty.   Time Warner and Hughes Aircraft say they already offerample flexibility. Some firms think offering several optionsis costly and try to protect employees' &quot;bad decisions,&quot;Hughes says. But this may be a &quot;rare&quot; time when employercompliance benefits participants, too, says consultant KwashaLipton.                                                                                                          ANOTHER NATIONAL TEST? This one would be job-oriented.   A 31-member commission named by the Labor Secretary thisspring will likely call for a national board to assess workskills of high school students. The plan is coming as aseparate debate rages over the merits of national exams togauge the education of elementary and high school students.The board would, instead, certify high-schoolers' specificjob-readiness levels.   The plan builds on a report last summer by another panelon work-force skills, which urged school and work changes soworkers can better handle high-tech jobs. Former LaborSecretary William Brock, head of both panels, says theassessments would help schools define needed work skills, andwould help employers judge the abilities of new workers.   If doctors used the same methods schools do, they wouldtreat first, wait five months to diagnose and then blame sickpatients, Mr. Brock says.                                                                                                          SAFETY AND HEALTH agencies at the Labor Department joinforces to decide what regulations are needed after theSupreme Court ruled employers can't transfer women, for theirprotection, from jobs exposing them to lead. OSHA and themine safety agency are focusing on hazards affecting womenand older workers.                                                                                                          GOING TOO FAR? The National Labor Relations Board generalcounsel rules that the Ladies Garment Workers is illegallytrying to stop fashion designer R.M. Perelman Co. from doingbusiness with nonunion truckers, or forming ventures with orbuying accessories from nonunion firms. Barring a settlement,a hearing will be set.                                                                                                          NOT HIRING TODAY: The Interstate Conference of EmploymentSecurity Agencies blames the federal government forrebuild-Kuwait promotions that wrongly suggest &quot;thousands ofjobs&quot; are at hand. Employment Service offices are inundatedwith calls from job-seekers; to date, an interstate job banklisted three such jobs.                                                                                                          THE AUTOMATION AGE: A Gallup Organization survey of 500offices, for Ricoh Corp., an office equipment firm, found faxmachines in 78%, copiers in 94%, personal computers in 87%and laser printers in 57%. Machines aren't just in centrallocations anymore, Ricoh says.                                                                                                          STUDENT CONFIDENCE fades, amid recession blues.   College seniors in 1990 saw themselves as&quot;executives-in-training,&quot; not entry-level workers, a surveyof 300 graduates by Dante Personnel Services showed. But thecurrent slump is humbling seniors, says Janet LaRose,University of Detroit career planning director; they'll takeless money and aren't picky about location. University ofMichigan grads know they must look longer and start lower, anofficial says.   &quot;This is the toughest year I've seen,&quot; a St. LawrenceUniversity official says. Some students at DePaul Universityin Chicago write a &quot;dream job&quot; resume, and another realisticone. Counselors at San Francisco State University urgeseniors to look harder at small firms.   Convincing University of California grads to leave the SanFrancisco area remains tough, a spokeswoman says.
