Lemasters chairman, chief executive officer and president.    Mr. Lemasters, 54 years old, succeeds David Yoder, 52, as chairman. In the positions of chief executive and president, he succeeds Edward J. Schneider, 57. Mr. Lemasters formerly was president and chief executive officer of Atlanta-based Contel Corp., a telecommunications concern.    The company, which makes power conversion units and measurement and control devices, said that Mr. Yoder will continue as a director and that Mr. Schneider will continue as president of its largest segment, the power conversion group.    Separately, Computer Products reported a net loss of $13 million for the fourth quarter ended Jan. 1, including a loss from discontinued operations of $8 million. For the year-earlier quarter, the company had a net loss of $3.6 million, including a loss from discontinued operations of $432,000. Revenue rose 19% to $27 million from $22.6 million.    For the year, the company reported a net loss of $12.3 million, including $9.4 million in losses from discontinued operations. In the previous year, it had a net loss of $9.3 million, including losses from discontinued operations of $3.6 million. Revenue rose 3% to $108.8 million from $105.3 million.    It said the fourth-quarter loss stemmed in large part from its unsuccessful attempt to sell its TCS process systems business. The company said it is still looking for a buyer, but that it took a $7.4 million charge by writing down the assets of that business.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Computer Products shares closed at $2.25, down 6.25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
