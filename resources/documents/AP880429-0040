Peter W. Rodino Jr.,D-N.J., said. ``Consequently, plastic firearms offer the potentialterrorist a window of opportunity and pose a serious threat to thepublic safety of all Americans.''   On Thursday, Rodino's committee approved, by voice vote,legislation sponsored by Rep. Bill Hughes, D-N.J., to ban themanufacture, sale or possession of undetectable plastic firearms.   The approval came after the panel defeated 23-12 an amendment byRep. George W. Gekas, R-Pa., that would have led to the deathpenalty for anyone using a so-called ``plastic gun'' in thecommission of a crime.   Law enforcement agencies and gun control groups have beenlobbying intensely for standards that would prevent terrorists fromconcealing plastic guns and slipping them past detectors.   No plastic gun has been manufactured, but a Florida company hasa patent on one that it has said it will manufacture for lawenforcement agencies in about two years.   Hughes, chairman of the Judiciary crime subcommittee, said thelegislation will not affect existing firearms but takes aim at anew generation of plastic firearms experts believe will bedeveloped and perfected in the near future.   ``This legislation is a fair and reasonable attempt to head offa serious law enforcement problem before it happens,'' said Hughes.``It's apparent that plastic guns would become the weapons ofchoice for terrorists and other criminals if they becameavailable.''   Under the bill, guns must contain at least 3.7 ounces ofelectronically detectable metal to make sure they can be picked upby magnetometer devices. It also requires that firearm componentsgenerate accurate X-ray images to assist in their detection.   The bill makes it a federal offense to knowingly manufacture,import, sell, transfer or possess a plastic firearm. It sets finesof up to $250,000 for individuals and $1 million for organizations,and up to five years in jail.   The legislation is similar to one agreed to by the JusticeDepartment, law enforcement groups and the National RifleAssociation which has opposed any changes in the law. That measureis expected to see quick passage in the Senate.   Mary Kaaren Jolly, NRA federal liaison, applauded the HouseJudiciary action, saying, ``We think it is the best piece oflegislation introduced to date in either the House or Senate side.''</TEXT></DOC>
