Sixty-four planes were damaged _ 42 at McCarran InternationalAirport here and 22 at Sky Harbor Airport in nearby Henderson _when hurricane-force wind ripped through the Las Vegas Valley onTuesday evening. Ten aircraft were heavily damaged or destroyed atMcCarran; 13 were destroyed at Sky Harbor.   No injuries were reported.   No commercial aircraft were damaged although some commercialflights were barred from taking off or landing until the stormpassed, McCarran spokeswoman Vicki Donaldson said.   Damage was ``well into the millions'' and could reach as high as$14 million, Ms. Donaldson said. Damage also was estimated in themillions at Sky Harbor.   Two aircraft used by Scenic Airlines Inc. for Grand Canyon tourswere blown into each other. The roof of the Scenic terminal, on thenorthern edge of the sprawling McCarran field, suffered heavydamage.   A hangar belonging to Circus Circus Enterprises was nearlydemolished, with one private jet left resting atop another.   One airplane was blown some 200 feet at McCarran, airportspokesman Sam Ingalls said. A number of aircraft were flipped, andtwo corporate hangars were destroyed, he added.   A large door on a hangar housing a $1 million Lockheed jetbelonging to entertainer Wayne Newton was blown away but the jetwas undamaged.   ``We have no idea where the door went,'' one of Newton's pilots,Mike Cotton, said Wednesday.   Damage at the airports was the only significant loss reported.There was some minor flooding and downed power lines, policespokesman Matt Alberto said. About 35,000 homes and businesses werewithout power for a period.   Some residents were rattled by the fierce wind and rain.   ``It was out of control. We could not see out of the windows ofour agency,'' said Karen Kerr, who was working at Golden ValleyTravel. ``The winds were blowing so hard. All of our phones andelectricity was out for about three hours.''   National Weather Service instruments recorded winds up to 90miles per hour before lightning knocked out service at about 6 p.m.That is the highest windspeed recorded in the Las Vegas Valley,said Charlie Schlott of the weather service's airport office.   George Feick, supervisor of the Federal AviationAdministration's control tower at McCarran, said FAA equipmentregistered one gust at 99 mph.   ``I've been here a few years and that's the highest windspeedI've ever seen,'' Feick said. ``It was pretty nasty, the tower wasswaying quite a bit.''</TEXT></DOC>
