The primary goal ofPURPA was to encourage more efficient use of the fuels that produce electricaland thermal energy for industrial, commercial, heating, and cooling purposes.A number of companies have since been formed to take advantage of thisopportunity. One of them, an unregulated subsidiary of the Southern CaliforniaEdison electric utility, was formed to create the Kern River cogenerationProject. Subsequent projects and subsidiaries were eventually consolidatedwith the Kern River Project into a single subsidiary known as the MissionEnergy Co. Mission Energy has expanded its original charter to providefor the production of additional forms of energy. Its goal now is todevelop and operated cogeneration, geothermal, hydroelectric, and conventionaloil-, gas-, and coal-fired steam and electric power plants.</TEXT></DOC>
