The chick should free itself by early Saturday, said TomHanscom, spokesman at the San Diego Wild Animal Park, where thechick was conceived by the only known active breeding pair of thenearly extinct California condors.   ``(The hole) makes our condor people's job easier,'' Hanscomsaid. ``They've been monitoring the chick's activity by closeobservation to detect movement of egg itself. Now with a directview of the chick, we can tell every time it moves.''   The chick dislodged the dime-sized bit of shell Thursday on itssecond day of pecking at the egg, accompanied by a recording ofvultures making hissing and grunting sounds. The recording wasplayed at two-hour intervals to try to duplicate the sounds thechick would hear in a natural nesting environment.   Condor keepers also occasionally tap the egg lightly with ametal rod to match the prodding encouragement of a parent condor.   ``We are still getting response from the egg when we tap andplay vulture sounds,'' Hanscom said. ``We are happy at theresponse. It indicates to us the chick is still alive and strong.At this point, we just to continue to watch.''   Park officials have set a 72-hour deadline _ ending at 4 a.m.Saturday _ at which time keepers will intervene with forceps andtweezers and gently chip small parks of the shell until they canpull the chick out, he said.   Officials don't want to intervene prematurely because of thedanger of rupturing blood vessels linked to egg membranes, whichcould trigger fatal internal bleeding.   ``It's an exciting time but a very anxious time,'' said Hanscom.``We do fear for over-exhaustion on the part of the chick. We'llall breathe a lot easier when we have a chick out of its shell andit indicates to us it is healthy and functioning correctly.''   The 10-ounce egg, about 5 inches long, has been under a 24-hourwatch since 4 a.m. Wednesday, when keepers noticed cracks in oneend. The ``pip'' cracks signaled the start of hatching, whichusually takes about three days.   A successful hatching would bring to 28 the known population ofNorth America's largest land bird, a member of the vulture familywith a wing span of 10 feet at maturity. All 27 California condorsknown to exist are in captivity _ 14 at the Wild Animal Park and 13at the Los Angeles Zoo.</TEXT></DOC>
