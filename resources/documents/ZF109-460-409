(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The ways in which we store data have made rapid advances ina ccess time andcapacity, but the market seems to favor more tradition technology.andP;  Here arethe variable that determine efficient storage--the balance between accesstime and cost per bit.andM;Memory and storage.andP;  Picture a pyramid.andP;  At the apex we find electronicmemory, with the least capacity for storage, but with the fastest access timeto data.andP;  Moving to the center of the pyramid, we come to on-line storage,slower to access than electronic memory, but able to accommodate moreinformation.andP;  We finally discover, at the base of the pyramid, off-linestorage, with a protracted access time, but a data storage capacity that islimited only by physical storage facilities.andM;The pyramid is the standard way to view memory and storage; it qualitativelyillustrates the trade-off between technology capabilities in terms of accesstime and associated cost per bit, cost per bit providing the metric forsetting the capacity available at each level.andM;Solid-state technology is used where performance demands call for the minimumin access time (with capacity limited by cost considerations) while magnetictape is used for off-line storage where masses of data need to be stored atthe lowest cost per bit.andP;  The hard disk drive (HDD) represents a uniquecompromise between access time, which can satisfy user interactivetransaction processing, and  low cost per bit.andP;  The on-line disk driverepresents about 90 % of the storage market revenue (as used here the termstorage refers to data storage devices that involve mechanical motion).andP;  Inspite of many technological approaches the pyramid today essentially can beviewed as composed of three identifiable levels: electronic memory, on-lineDASD (direct access storage devices) in the form of magnetic hard diskdrives, and off-line removable magnetic tape cartridges (associated with afew manually loaded tape drive stations).andP;  (For larger installations,automated libraries, in which removable cartridges are transported to I/Odrives under system control, are now being identified as an intermediatelevel between on-line and off-line, called near-line by Storagetek.) The harddisk drive (HDD) represents a unique compromise between access time and lowcost per bit that has not only survived and prospered but withuser-interactive, real-time transactions-oriented capabilities, has been thekey element in the growth of new applications.andP;  This article will focus onthe two major storage levels in the pyramid, then address automatic librariesand finally alternatives to magnetic disk and tape.andM;On-Line Storage.andP;  Hard Disk Drives.andP;  The first commercial disk drive (IBMRamac, 1956) used 50, 24-inch diameter disks, which provided a non-volatiledirect-overwrite store with a capacity of 5 megabytes and an access time ofalmost one second.andP;  Today the volume leader at the low end is 3 1/2 inches indiameter.andP;  Some models with a height of one inch can store up to 210megabytes with an access time of less than 20 milliseconds.andP;  Moreover,production is now gearing up for a 2 1/2 inch drive that will fit in a shirtpocket and store 40 megabytes.andP;  Twenty-megabyte drives of this size now areappearing in commercial laptops.andM;Two technical innovations that led to this dramatic progress were:andM;*The first disk drive required a complex compressor system to providepressurized air to the head for setting and controlling head-to-disk spacing.andO;All drives since then use a flying head that rides on the boundary layer ofair carried by the disk, providing a simplified means to place one or moreheads on a disk surface, as well as offer the promise of very small spacings.andO;Head-to-medium separation on the most- advanced drives is now in the range of4 to 6 microinches, more than 166 times smaller than the Ramac (1000microinches).andM;*Head-positioning systems have changed from open loop to closed loop with theposition error signal derived from patterned servo information on the surfaceof a disk.andP;  From twenty tracks per inch on the Ramac, track densities are nowin the range of 2000 tracks per inch.andM;Status and trends.andP;  Component technologies.andP;  Advances in materials andair-bearing design have led to flying heights of 4 millionths of an inch;this achievement is accompanied by the confidence that even lower spacingsare possible.andP;  The study of contact recording has gained more adherents.andO;Accompanied by higher-coercivity recording media and magnetic heads, such asthe dual-element magneto-resistive read (MR) inductive write head, thepotential for much higher storage densities has been demonstrated.andP;  Inaddition to being able to optimize separately for the write and readoperations, by making the read element narrower than the write, noise from&quot;old&quot; and adjacent track information can be minimized.andM;A recent IBM one gigabit/inch study serves as an existence theorem for theeventual achievement of at least another factor of ten in the densitycapabilities of digital magnetic disk recording (see Figure 1).andP;  Anotherfeature of this work, one that departed from current practice, was the use ofa partial response maximum likelihood (PRML) rather than a conventional peaksensing channel.andP;  The PRML can offer almost a 3 dB gain in SNR.andM;Disk form factor.andP;  As storage density increases, the same capacity andperformance can be offered in a much smaller package.andP;  To reduce queuingdelays in accessing data there is a limit to how much capacity should beassociated with a single access path (actuator) to the data.andP;  Further, majorincreases in the I/O data rate are required with increasing CPU performance,and are attainable through parallel data channels.andP;  These factors are leadingto systems that have more and more smaller-diameter drives attached.andO;Advantages in power, cost, packaging, and the like are by-products ofdownsizing.andP;  A major distinction between small disk drives and semiconductormemory is that the former represents an assembly of precision componentswhile the latter uses photolithography to form a dense packing of memoryelements.andP;  The smallest possible size of disk diameters can be debated, butclearly there is one vision in which disk units will plug into a card and bepowered from the main board.andM;Disk subsystems.andP;  More sophisticated controllers have led to systemsinnovations which provide value added extensions to any given level oftechnology.andP;  Zoned Bit Recording (ZBR) commercially introduced by Imprimis(now part of Seagate), increases the recording data rate as the track radiusincreases.andP;  The increased recording record achieves near-maximum lineardensities over the entire recording band rather than only at the innerdiameter.andP;  This feature increases the capacity by 30 to 50 percent.andP;  Inaddition, with the advances being made in VLSI the implementation ofdata-compression algorithms to further increase storage capacity are nowbeing explored and in some instances already implemented.andP;  System andcontroller design optimization issues have begun to focus on arrays of disks.andO;From the remarks above it is clear that disk storage subsystems will be madeup of increasingly large numbers of small and relatively inexpensive disks.andO;Already techniques such as shadowing or mirroring, pairing two disk drivesand writing to both to achieve reliability and fault tolerance, and striping,writing the data in a parallel mode over a number of disk drives, havealready become common.andP;  More sophisticated methods of configuring diskarrays, using redundant drives and hot spares as well as securing both highdata rate and high access rates by control of the large number of actuators(or data paths) that will be available, will be aggressively pursued.andM;Off-Line Removable Storage Media.andP;  Magnetic Tape.andP;  Removable media can beviewed as the storage level where the dominant need is for low cost per bit.andO;Applications include archives, backup, data interchange, etc.andP;  Tape access todata within a cartridge is sequential, whereas with a disk cartridge directaccess is possible.andP;  So, there are applications trade-offs that offeropportunities for optical disks.andP;  However, the maximum recording area perunit volume becomes a key technology criterion and consequently, with theirthin substrates and by spooling of tape, tape cartridges stand alone in theirinherent advantage in bits per cubic inch.andM;Similar to the situation with magnetic disk, continued technical advances inheads and media for tape devices, will offer s increases in recordingdensity.andP;  Metal evaporated tape, MET, is the newest advance that is beginningto enter the market.andM;Longitudinal tape devices.andP;  The one-half inch cartridge.andP;  The 3480 IBM tapedrive uses 1/2 -inch tape, an 18-track head, and due to the parallel transferof data, operates at 3 MB per second.andP;  The IBM 1/2 inch cartridge has becomea de facto standard.andP;  The low-track densities associated with conventionallongitudinal tape drives result in relatively low cartridge capacities.andP;  TheIBM 3480 cartridges records at only 32 tracks per inch and stores just 200megabytes.andP;  The path taken to upgrade performance has been to providedata-compression capabilities.andP;  Data compression is a method for increasingthe effective capacity (and hence data rate) by essentially removingredundancy in the encoded data.andP;  The algorithms can lead, depending on thecharacter of the source files, to a compression factor of 2 to 4 or 5.andP;  Onthe readback, the inverse operation restores the original data.andM;Like ZBR, data compression adds performance gains, with given levels ofcomponent technology, by systems-oriented techniques.andM;Kodak is pursuing a new tape format with servo tracks included on the tape inorder to combine the high data-rate possibilities of longitudinal recordingwith high track densities to make these devices more competitive in terms ofcapacity.andP;  With many more options now available, particularly the rotary- orhelical-scan devices, the necessity of yet another format is not assured.andM;The quarter-inch cartridge, now serving the role of the backup device ofchoice for low-end systems, has its position threatened by the new rotarydrives coming on the market (see below).andP;  To achieve low cost, the simplestdrives uses a single magnetic head for data transfer and step the head acrossthe tape as it reverses in what is called serpentine recording.andP;  In responseto this competitive market pressure, the technology is being aggressivelypushed and a 1.3 GB cartridge has been announced, a dramatic increase incapacity beyond previous offerings.andP;  An advantage is its potential for higherdata-transfer rate than low-end rotary devices by using some form ofmulti-track head assembly.andM;Rotary-Head Devices.andP;  Rotary-head tape devices have made dramatic technicaladvances in response to the huge consumer market in audio and videorecording.andP;  These helical-scan devices offer very high track density (900 toalmost 2000 tpi) in addition to high linear density.andP;  It was only naturalthat this capability would attract the interest of the computer data storagearea.andP;  This head/tape configuration favors high track density (and hence highcapacity), but uses a single active-head channel.andP;  The high relative speed ofthe spinning head assembly gives respectable data rates, although they arefar less than that provided by parallel-track longitudinal recording.andM;The first company to establish itself is Exabyte with its 8mm (Sony)cartridge.andP;  The drive uses the mechanism of the Handycam 8mm camera and thesame cartridge standard.andP;  The product was initially introduced with 2.3 GB ofdata on a single cartridge and quickly found acceptance for storing largefiles and exchanging data among scientific users.andP;  Al capacity has beendoubled and IBM announced that this device would be available on its 6000series of workstations.andM;The Digital Audio Tape (DAT) drive mechanism and cartridge (4mm) is alsobeing exploited for data storage.andP;  The computer-oriented version holds 1.3 GBof data.andP;  Copy-protection issues have cause the delay in the consumerintroduction of DAT and slowed its application to data storage since low costdepends on the growth of a mass consumer market for digital audio tape.andM;In addition, larger-size cartridges (19mm) are being standardized forprofessional audio and video, as well as instrumentation digitalapplications, and with the greater tape surface area per cartridge, eachcartridge can allow more than 50 GB of storage.andM;Floppy dish drives.andP;  Insite Corporation has announced a 20-megabyte floppythat includes a number of exciting innovations.andP;  The disk is a standard 31/2-inch floppy consisting of very narrow tracks formed on the recordingsurface with a different reflectively from the remaining disk surface.andP;  Thesetracks are sensed optically and provide a means to position a conventionalmagnetic head that records in the region between them.andP;  A combined magnetic-and optical-head structure that can be servoed optically allows 1250 tpi(compared with the standard floppy disk drive which operates at 135 tpi).andP;  Amuch higher-capacity floppy would seem to be attractive for programdistribution (many applications require up to 12 conventional diskettes); fornotebook computers, it could be considered as a substitute for a hard disk.andO;However, these features must be obtained while still being compatible withexisting floppy formats and at a cost commensurate with floppy disk drives.andO;A much higher product cost would require that the device begin to approachthe performance range of a small hard disk to be competitive.andM;Niche categories.andP;  CD-ROM.andM;The technology is available, and the costs have been decreasing steadily asthe devices piggyback on the CD audio disk.andP;  The opportunities and challengestoday are in the database, publications, and data distribution businesses.andO;More CD-ROM devices will be attached as peripheral units as computerapplications become more audio/visual-oriented.andM;Write Once.andP;  A write-once medium offers assurance that data (images oforiginal documents, etc.) cannot be deliberately modified.andP;  Many microficheapplications are obvious candidates to migrate to WORM, as well aspaper-intensive record systems.andP;  The potential opportunities for write onceoptical media have been deferred from consideration in anticipation oferasable optical drives.andP;  Now that such drives are entering the market thelong term role of WORM should become clear.andM;Automated Libraries.andP;  Automating the handling of removable media and placingremovable storage under system control, meets the needs of a growingcommunity of users.andP;  The number of users with increasingly large databases isexpanding continuously.andP;  The key to the success of the Storagetek near-lineautomated system is the use of the standard 1/2 -inch tape cartridge and arelatively simple software interface.andM;The basic unit uses a silo filled with cartridges; these are accessed by apicker located at the center that has both rotary and axial positioningmotions.andP;  A selected cartridge is delivered to a port where a 1/2-inchcartridge drive is located.andP;  The design allows terabytes of storage to beaccessed without need for manual intervention.andM;The cartridge removability offered by tape and optical disk suggests thatthese technologies will compete directly in some applications.andP;  The highercost of the optical-media cartridge makes the implementation of optical jukeboxes a particularly attractive option, since more competitivecost/performance trade-offs can be possible.andM;Alternatives to Magnetic Disk and Tape.andP;  Erasable Optical Disk.andP;  Now,magneto-optical drives are being marketed, almost exclusively by Japanesecompanies.andP;  In terms of capacity they offer from one-half to over a gigabyteper cartridge.andP;  However, access to all the data on a disk is not possiblewithout flipping the disk over.andP;  Seek time is much less than that of harddisk drives due to the greater mass of an optical head.andP;  The power availablewith current laser diodes limits the writing rate; combined with the flexibledisk substrate, the drive has a rotational speed of 1800 rpm (half that ofthe standard magnetic disk drive), resulting in twice the latency.andM;Current magneto-optical drives also are not able to directly overwrite, butrather take two revolutions to write data.andP;  During writing the laser heatsthe bit cell as it passes.andP;  The elevated temperature allows the direction ofthe cell magnetization to be set (up or down) by a magnetic field oriented inthe corresponding direction.andP;  Unfortunately, a large magnetic field isnecessary; it can only be switched relatively slowly, well below the datarate.andP;  Thus one revolution is used to erase the record to the zero state andon a second revolution the laser is pulsed to insert the ones.andM;Unlike magnetic data storage, the limits of optical storage density areeasily related to the wavelength of the laser that is used.andP;  Thus, futurehigher-density product generations will require the commercial availabilityof a shorter-wavelength laser source.andP;  The relatively small installed baseand the sophistication of the removable cartridge currently make thecartridge fairly expensive, particularly when compared with magnetic tape.andO;Applications for erasable optical drives are being explored intensivelybecause they do offer a high capacity in a removable disk format.andM;Solid-State Memory.andP;  The need for more on-line capacity is increasing fasterthan the storage density advances of dynamic RAM (DRAM) and hard disk drives,but both will continue to see a growing market.andP;  To date, the lowering costof solid state memory has been to the advantage of disk drives through theincreasing feasibility of disk caching to enhance performance by maskingaccess time., etc.andP;  The increase of on-line disk storage parallels thecontinued expansion in main memory.andP;  While some extrapolations suggest thatby the year 2010, the cost per bit of solid-state memory could reach that ofhard disk drives; this is not a widely held view.andP;  The fact is that with adisk drive, the cost of relatively simple mechanics for access is pro-ratedover a high density medium; and has proven intrinsically more cost effectivethan complex interconnections to each bit cell required in electronic memory.andM;Memory Alternatives.andP;  Ferro-electric memory is new approach to non-mechanicalstorage that, like magnetic is non-volatile.andP;  In fact, magnetic bubbleconcepts continue to be developed.andP;  These approaches should be viewed asalternatives to DRAM rather than hard disk.andP;  For them to succeed in themarket they first must capture the substantial memory-market volume held byDRAM in order to realize a cost base that would allow these technologies tocompete with magnetic disk.andM;Given the large market that must be satisfied, a new technology faces greatobstacles to entry until the mainstream approaches falter or reachtechnological limits.andP;  Neither of these situations applies to magneticrecording or semiconductor memory devices.andP;  In fact, hard disk drivescontinue to advance at their historical rate and we have more theoretical andexperimental evidence today that the limits are far beyond the current stateof the art.andP;  Magnetic tape is now seeing a renaissance in which its potentialis identified in terms of technology potential rather than standards.andO;Optical drives have now entered the marketplace and will find increasingacceptance, but in applications where they do not have to competehead-to-head with hard disk drives or strictly in terms of cost per bit withtape.andP;  There is no question that solid-state devices will hold more and moredata that formerly, for cost reasons, resided on disk.andP;  As the technologyadvances and cost per bit comes down, data once stored on tape can now beeconomically moved to disk.andP;  But with the total increase in storage required,near- and off-line storage also will grow.andP;  All the basic storage levels inthe hierarchy should prosper.andM;By any measure, memory and storage are technologies with an almostunbelievable track record in advances.andP;  While alternatives continue to bepursued, given the size of the market, the barriers to entry posed byentrenched technologies (that in their own right are advancing rapidly) areformidable.andM;Albert S. Hoagland is director of the Institute for Information StorageTechnology at Santa Clara University and a EECS professor in SCU's School ofEngineering.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
