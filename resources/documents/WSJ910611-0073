Placements decline 40% to 50% for programs inSouth Bend, Ind., and Boston. A Philadelphia group seesplacements falling 27%, to 800, even as 12% more youthsinterview for jobs.</LP><TEXT>   A Decatur, Ga., council canceled a jobs fair when onlythree firms signed up, down from 50 in past years. It alsohalted job applications early. An Indiana group trimmedrecruitment efforts. But the New York summer program willextend hiring through July and step up its pitch toemployers, trying to find 45,000 jobs. Boston and Trenton,N.J., programs bolster jobseeking staffs.   A Cleveland group is trying to sell each kid's strongpoints instead of just seeking job pledges from firms.                                                                                                          EMPLOYER GROUPS cautiously praise a Senate health-carebill.   The legislation, introduced by Democratic leaders lastweek, would make employers provide health coverage forworkers or pay into a pool to cover the uninsured. TheWashington Business Group on Health, which represents largeemployers, says the &quot;play-or-pay&quot; measure will open&quot;productive&quot; debate by addressing issues of costs andunneeded or fragmented medical care. But, the group warns,the bill is &quot;controversial.&quot;   The measure is the first congressional health-care reformproposal responding to employers' desires to keep privatecoverage and contain costs, but its cost controls don't gofar enough and other provisions would create administrativenightmares, says the Erisa Industry Committee, anotherlarge-firm group. National Small Business United calls thebill a step forward, but with &quot;harmful&quot; and &quot;costly&quot;elements.                                                                                                          DIVIDED UNION RANKS muddle lobbying for a health-careoverhaul.   The AFL-CIO backs the Senate Democrats' bill. But thefront isn't solid; unions initially split 8 to 8 on the issueat the AFL-CIO's winter meeting. Service Employees chief JohnSweeney says unions favor the Democrats' limited plan as allthat's politically realistic now. The building-trades, steeland other unions agree.   But the American Federation of State, County and MunicipalEmployees and the auto and other unions prefer Canadian-stylenational health insurance as the only way to curb costs.AFSCME head Gerald McEntee scores the &quot;play-or-pay&quot; plan ascutting few costs while raising many employers' expenses andtrimming their workers' wages. Why try to &quot;patch up a systemthat cannot even meet the needs of the middle class?&quot; heasks.   A Senate staffer says he would prefer that unions be &quot;allgung-ho&quot; for the Democrats' bill, but says unions still will&quot;use all their muscle to move it.&quot;                                                                                                          OUT OF THE PAST: Elliot Richardson and Joseph Califano,health secretaries in the Nixon and Carter administrationsrespectively, are expected to support the concept of theSenate Democrats' health-care bill in a Labor Committeehearing today. Nixon proposed a similar plan in 1971.                                                                                                          GETTING THEIR DUE? Of 100 chief executives of publiclyheld savings and loan associations studied by consultantGrant Thornton, one-third took pay cuts, averaging 13%, in1990. Raises for others averaged 0.5% last year, down from 7%in 1989. The thrifts' average return on assets fell 51%.                                                                                                          BANK EMPLOYEES, meanwhile, are getting more nervous; 51%of more than 58,000 workers in 52 banks surveyed by HumanResource Services felt less secure than a year ago. Over 25%were dissatisfied with their jobs, up from 15% in a 1988study.                                                                                                          JOB SATISFACTION isn't so important to a University ofNorth Carolina business school class taught by Ph.D.candidate Mabel Miguel. Fully 73% feel it unnecessary to becompletely satisfied with a job; about half want &quot;big bucks&quot;a lot, only 3% not at all.                                                                                                          EMPLOYEE BENEFITS at small firms lag far behind those inbigger ones.   The Bureau of Labor Statistics, in its first study ofbenefits provided by small employers, dramatizes the knowngap. Medical care was offered to full-time workers by 69% offirms with fewer than 100 workers in 1990, and life insuranceby 64%, compared with 92% and 94%, respectively, of largercompanies in 1989.   Only 42% of small firms offered retirement plans tofull-time employees, while 81% of larger ones did so. Unpaidmaternity leave was provided by 17% of small employers, but37% of larger firms offered it. Paid holidays or vacationswere given by 83% and 88% of small companies, respectively,and by 97% of larger employers.   The small firms offered health and life insurance to only6% of part-time help, while 10% had a retirement plan and 29%got paid vacations.                                                                                                          THE CHECKOFF: Time needed for the average job search fellto 15 weeks in the first quarter from 20 weeks in all lastyear, consultant Right Associates says. . . . The AFL-CIObacks a &quot;Toycott&quot; campaign to boycott Chinese-made toys. Itwas begun by youth and Chinese and Tibetan groups protestingChina's alleged use of prison labor and other human rightsviolations. . . .
