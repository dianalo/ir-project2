Sunnow includes most of its software free with its work stations; it alsolicenses it to makers of Sun clones.;     Though Sun has pioneered thecommercialization of the Unix operating system, several observers said thesoftware side of the business sometimes gets lost. But they predicted thatwill change with Wednesday' announcement of the formation of the wholly ownedsubsidiaries, both of which will be charged with making a profit.;    And bygiving its software operations new focus, Sun is also positioning itself forthe decline in prices and profit margins that is inevitable in the world ofhardware.;    Edward J. Zander, formerly vice president of marketing, has beennamed president of Sunsoft, and Eric E. Schmidt, previously vice president ofSun's general systems group, will lead Suntech.;    If Sunsoft's name bringsto mind another software company -- Microsoft -- it's probably not accidental,as Sun clearly hopes to be the sole supplier of operating system software tothe booming work-station market, in the same way that Microsoft supplies thepersonal computer marketplace.;    Sun even said it might consider selling itssoftware for other computer systems, though it gave no word on when that mighthappen. Machines using Intel Corp.'s microprocessors are a likely candidate.;   &quot;(Sun President) Scott McNealy sees (Microsoft Chairman) Bill Gates with hisbillions in the bank and says, 'Why can't we do that?' &quot; said Sam Gibbs,president of Avcom Systems Inc., a large Sun dealer in Palo Alto. &quot;Sun isalready licensing hardware like Intel. Now they'll be licensing software likeMicrosoft. They see it as the best of both worlds.&quot;;    Such a move would notcome without competition. Microsoft, for one, has made it clear it has its ownideas on who should supply the work-station market.;    Several firms sellingsoftware for the Sun market said they did not worry about competition from Sunbut instead expected better support from the new outfits.;    &quot;I think it'sgreat for us,&quot; said Richard J. Davis, executive vice president of Applix Inc.of Westboro, Mass., which sells office software for Sun machines.;    AllanSnell, vice president of marketing at Solbourne Computer Inc., a maker ofSun-compatible computers, said software firms that had been reluctant to enterthe Sun marketplace because of a wariness about working with Sun might now bepersuaded to do so, since they would perceive the software firms as beingseparate from the main company.;    Sun also announced Wednesday that it wasforming Sun Laboratories to conduct long-range research. Wayne Rosing,formerly vice president of the desk-top systems and graphics group, will headSun Labs.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  LEE GOMES, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910214  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  581  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday February 14, 199100045157,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
