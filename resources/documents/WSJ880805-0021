Stewart and Daniel Hertzberg (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK SCR </IN><G> JUS </G><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal grand jury indicted five partners of Princeton/Newport Partners and a former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. official on charges of racketeering, conspiracy, and mail and wire fraud.    The case, which was expected, marks the first time officials of securities firms have been charged with violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO. The charges demonstrate the government's resolve to prosecute those accused in the current Wall Street insider-trading scandal with the strongest weapons in its arsenal, usually reserved for organized crime and drug cases.    Named in the indictment are James Sutton Regan, a managing general partner of Princeton/Newport, and four Princeton/Newport partners: Jack Rabinowitz, Charles M. Zarzecki, Paul Berkman and Steven Ari Smotrich. Each was charged with 32 counts of mail and wire fraud.    The former Drexel official charged is Bruce Lee Newberg, a trader of convertible securities who worked in Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif., office until earlier this year. He was charged with 26 counts of mail and wire fraud.    All six defendants also were charged with single counts of conspiracy, racketeering and racketeering conspiracy.    Lawyers for four of the defendants asserted their clients' innocence, vowed to vigorously contest the charges and protested the use of RICO in what they said should be, at most, a civil tax case. Theodore Wells, the lawyer for Mr. Regan, said the government is attempting to criminalize charges that have &quot;previously been viewed as purely technical and deserving of civil reprimand, at worst.&quot;    Lawyers for Messrs. Smotrich and Newberg couldn't be reached for comment.    A Drexel spokesman said, &quot;Obviously, today's indictment of Bruce Newberg, a former employee of the firm, is deeply disturbing. We have only recently become acquainted with some of the allegations in the case. We have been informed by Bruce Newberg's lawyer that he intends to plead not guilty. It would be unfair for us to prejudge the case or to comment further at this time.&quot;    The indictment in the case against the six men outlines an alleged tax scheme in which Princeton/Newport officials created false long-term capital gains and short-term capital losses for the firm by engaging in numerous &quot;rigged&quot; and &quot;pre-arranged&quot; transactions with Drexel. This enabled Princeton/Newport to generate more than $13 million in &quot;bogus&quot; tax losses from November 1984 through February 1986, the indictment charges.    The indictment also alleges a &quot;sham sale&quot; of securities in which Drexel parked Mattel Inc. securities with Princeton/Newport to evade federal capital requirements for securities firms.    The indictment contains what the government alleges is a transcript of portions of a Princeton/Newport tape recording of a telephone conversation between Mr. Regan and Mr. Newberg on April 8, 1985. The two allegedly argued about the carrying, or financing, costs that Princeton/Newport was charging Drexel for parking Drexel's position in Mattel, a major toy maker.    &quot;I've carried plenty of positions for you, in case you haven't been realizing it,&quot; Mr. Newberg allegedly told Mr. Regan. &quot;I've been charging you my cost to carry.&quot;    Mr. Regan allegedly replied: &quot;What I carry on my books now, is your position.&quot; The two then agreed to unwind the parked position, the indictment charges.    The indictment also contains alleged quotes from a tape of an April 11, 1985, telephone conversation between Princeton/Newport's Mr. Zarzecki and Mr. Newberg, in which the two allegedly arranged to illegally drive down the price of C.O.M.B. Co. stock prior to a 1985 Drexel offering of securities in the merchandiser. The indictment gave no motive for driving down the price. However, there are a variety of situations where an underwriter can benefit when the price of a security declines.    According to the indictment, C.O.M.B. stock was trading at about $16, and Mr. Newberg told Mr. Zarzecki that:   &quot;I don't want this thing to be 16 bid . . . I want you to, you know, to get rid of it . . . I want it down to at least 15 3/4 and hopefully lower . . . I wouldn't mind you selling a little bit first. And . . . you're indemnified . . . you know what I'm saying.&quot;    The indictment alleges that Princeton/Newport that day sold 40,000 shares of C.O.M.B. as part of the scheme.    Not mentioned in the indictment is Cary Maultasch, a Drexel employee who has been named in Securities and Exchange Commission civil charges against Drexel that have been approved by the SEC, but not filed, as part of the government's broader investigation of Drexel. As previously reported, Mr. Maultasch was among those expected to be charged yesterday.    People familiar with the case said that Mr. Maultasch's attorney received a call late Wednesday night or early yesterday from a prosecutor. According to the people, the prosecutor said that Mr. Maultasch wouldn't be indicted immediately and could come into the U.S. attorney's office next week and try to convince the government that he shouldn't be charged. Mr. Maultasch's lawyer couldn't be reached for comment.    Princeton/Newport has had business relationships with two people who are subjects of wider government investigations in the insider trading scandal. One is Michael Milken, the head of Drexel's high-yield bond department in Beverly Hills. The other is Robert Freeman, head of arbitrage at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. Mr. Regan was a Dartmouth College classmate and is described as a close friend of Mr. Freeman.    Mr. Regan has worked with Mr. Milken for years, buying securities through Drexel's Beverly Hills office and investing with Mr. Milken in other ventures. He is a regular participant at Drexel's annual bond conferences in Beverly Hills.    The indictment alleges that Drexel's Mr. Newberg &quot;reported directly to the head&quot; of Drexel's high-yield bond department. At a news conference yesterday, where he was asked repeatedly whether Mr. Milken knew about the alleged schemes, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani said that &quot;at this moment the charges are as regards to Mr. Newberg, and I can't go beyond that.&quot; He said the government's investigation continues.    A spokeswoman for Mr. Milken declined comment yesterday.    Defense lawyers charged that prosecutors are misusing the RICO statute to attempt to bludgeon their clients into testifying against Messrs. Milken and Freeman. Jack Arseneault, the lawyer for Mr. Berkman, said that last Jan. 5 Assistant U.S. Attorney Bruce Baird told him, &quot;We have no real interest&quot; in Mr. Berkman or Princeton/Newport, but that &quot;Princeton can help us with Drexel Burnham and others . . . If you cooperate, fine. If you don't, we are going to roll right over you to get where we want to go.&quot;    Mr. Baird, who heads the Manhattan U.S. attorney's securities-fraud unit, denied the quote attributed to him.    ---   Ann Hagedorn contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
