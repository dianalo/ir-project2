STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A high East German official rejected thedemocratic reforms some Soviet bloc allies have embraced and saidThursday that communism will continue to dominate society.   Another said the government will listen to ``all parts of thepopulation'' clamoring for change as long as they do not insist onscrapping the current social order.   There were signs of strong differences within the leadershipover how to deal with the flight of tens of thousands of citizensto the West and growing demand at home for a freer society. Reportspersisted that 77-year-old Erich Honecker, the nation's hard-lineleader, was in trouble.   Bild, a mass-circulation West German newspaper, quoted CommunistParty sources it did not identify as saying Honecker would bereplaced Oct. 18.   Eduard Lintner, inter-German affairs spokesman for ChristianDemocrats in the West German parliament, was quoted in the dailyPassauer Neue Presse as saying Honecker's departure was``immediately at hand.''   Communist Party sources in East Germany said an increasingnumber of ranking party figures are displeased with how Honeckerhandled the exodus of young, skilled workers and recentpro-democracy protests.   The official news agency ADN carried a routine dispatch Thursdaythat omitted his title as head of the Communist Party, the morepowerful of his two posts. ADN usually refers to him as bothCommunist Party leader and head of state.   Honecker's picture has not appeared on the front pages of partynewspapers for two days. It usually appears daily.   Der Tagesspiegel, a West Berlin paper, said Thursday ``a strongmajority'' in the ruling 21-member Politburo favored Honecker'sdeparture.   After what sources said was a volatile meeting, the Politburopromised on Wednesday to examine the causes of the flight and theprotests. It said the government would be willing to discussreforms.   Lutheran Church sources in East Berlin said late Thursday thatLeipzig officials were preparing to release all those arrested inprotests there since Sept. 11. The number was not immediatelyknown, but up to 500 people are believed still to be in jail.   Whatever the hints of a more liberal attitude, a commentary inthe Berliner Zeitung newspaper Thursday by Central Committee memberOtto Reinhold emphasized ``the leading role of the party'' inbringing about any change.   Reinhold said he wanted to distinguish the role of the party inEast Germany from the ``ever-increasing variety'' of changes inother Socialist countries.   The statement was obviously a reference to East Germany'spreviously sharp repudiations of the dramatic democratic reformssweeping East bloc allies Hungary and Poland.   ``Reforms for the sake of reforms aren't in demand, but ratherchanges which will serve the further development of socialism,''Reinhold said.   Kurt Hager, East German Communist Party ideology chief andanother influential Politburo member, offered a more conciliatoryline.   He was quoted by West Germany's ZDF television as saying thatthere was no ``differences of opinion'' in the party leadership. Hesaid leaders had agreed it was necessary to open a dialogue ``allparts of the population.''   But Hager strongly indicated that he did not include the growingopposition movement among them.   ``If they want to question our social order, then that's not abasis for discussions,'' said Hager.   Hager's remarks came during a trip to Moscow for the opening ofa culture exhibition. Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, duringa visit to East Berlin last week, urged Honecker to undertakereforms.   Meanwhile, reaction was cautious Thursday to the statement theday before by the Politburo, which is trying to appease somewhatthe forces of unrest while still presenting a unified frontcommitted to socialism.   Manfred Stolpe, a top Lutheran Church official in East Berlin,welcomed the government's commitment to dialogue as ``an importantstep.''   But Baerbel Bohley, co-founder of the opposition group NewForum, described the Politburo statement as a ``verbal shift thatdoes not take into account real life.''   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwilerwelcomed the East German offer of a dialogue but said ``dialogueshould be meaningful and not just a tactical move to relievedomestic and international pressure.''   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief of staff, RudolfSeiters, said Kohl was optimistic.   ``This could be the first positive signal to the populace thatthe East German leadership has given,'' Seiters said of thePolitburo statement. ``But we must wait to see what concretemeasures it carries.''</TEXT></DOC>
