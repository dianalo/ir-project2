Vanguard, a Valley Forge, Pa., vendor of low-cost funds with $33 billion under management, proposed to succeed Liberty Asset Management Co. as manager of the $453 million diversified stock fund.    In a proposal to the fund's trustees, Vanguard argued that the switch would benefit the Liberty fund's shareholders by cutting annual fund expenses by about $2 million a year to $675,000.    Hostile takeovers are rare in the mutual fund industry. Vanguard is pressing Liberty's trustees to convert the fund, which has a so-called closed-end structure, to open-end status, said John Bogle, Vanguard's chairman.    That move would be an immediate boon to the Liberty fund's shareholders, who would receive the difference between Liberty's currently discounted share price and the value of the portfolio.    Closed-end funds issue a fixed number of shares that trade at a premium or discount to their net-asset value on the open market. Open-end funds don't trade publicly, but continually issue and redeem shares on demand.    Yesterday, Liberty shares surged 75 cents to $7.625 on the New York Stock Exchange composite tape. The fund's portfolio value was unchanged at $8.43 a share -- trimming the discount to 9.5% from more than 18%.    Liberty's trustees said in a statement late yesterday that Vanguard's proposal would be &quot;inconsistent with both the basic philosophy of the fund and shareholders' best interests.&quot;    This isn't the first time Vanguard tried to take over Liberty. A similar move last December was rejected by Liberty's management on a technicality because Mr. Bogle hadn't held his Liberty shares for a full year. (Mr. Bogle currently owns 1,000 shares.)    The unusual bid faces hurdles. Liberty has several provisions, including a staggered board, that would make gaining control difficult. And, said Thomas Herzfeld, a Miami-based investment manager who specializes in closed-end funds: &quot;Shareholders tend to vote with the existing management.&quot;    Vanguard asked that its proposal be included in proxy material for the fund's 1989 annual meeting. A meeting date hasn't been set, Liberty officials said, but it's expected to be in the spring.    Liberty uses a rare &quot;multi-management&quot; approach, dividing fund assets among five outside management firms. Those managers -- Cooke andamp; Bieler Inc.; Dreman Value Management Inc.; W.H. Newbold's Son andamp; Co.'s Newbold's Asset Management Inc. unit; Provident Investment Council Inc. and Phoenix Mutual Life Insurance Co.'s Phoenix Investment Council affiliate -- were sought because of their superior performance records.    But the group hasn't lived up to its all-star expectations. Since the fund was launched two years ago, the portfolio's value has badly lagged the broad market averages, declining about 16%. But John Benning, Liberty's corporate secretary, said during that time the fund also has paid shareholders cash distributions totaling $1.62 a share.    Mr. Bogle sought to portray the move as &quot;justice.&quot; But for Vanguard, it's clearly a good business deal: The group would pick up 50,000 shareholders and more than $450 million at a time when funds are scrapping for new customers. </TEXT></DOC>
