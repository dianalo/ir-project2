Fighting involving 5,000 students occurred at five campuses inSeoul, Kwangju, Taejon and Chonju after riot police blocked studentsfrom marching into the streets, police officials said. Protesterssurged out of the campuses to attack police with hundreds offirebombs.   ``Punish Roh Tae-woo!'' and ``Down with dictatorship!''protesters yelled.   Police officials said there were numerous minor injuries, butthey had no reports of arrests.   Student leaders called for the overthrow of Roh and demanded tobe allowed to take part in a youth festival next month in communistNorth Korea. South Korea's government has refused to allow thestudents to take part in the 13th World Youth Festival in Pyongyang,the capital of North Korea, on July 1-8.   ``March to Pyongyang!'' students chanted as they beat drums andwaved flags.   Peaceful anti-government protests were also held today at manycolleges in Seoul and other cities, but police said they had nofigures on how many.   The fighting marked the second day of widespread campus clashesin Seoul and other cities and indicated radical students hadabandoned a self-imposed ban on firebombs. Some student groups saidthey would stop using the weapons after seven riot police werekilled in a May 3 campus clash, but other groups continued to usefirebombs.   The students and allied dissident groups have little publicsupport because of their extremist views and violent tactics.   Student leaders who refused to be identified said they had beenforced to use firebombs as self-defense against police attacks. Butthe fighting today all appeared to have been started by studentswhen police blocked the marches.   About 2,000 students from at least six colleges battled hundredsof police at Hankuk University in Seoul. Riot police surrounding theschool hurled rocks at the protesters but did not use tear gas.   Students marched out of the school and attacked riot policeblocking the road with wooden clubs and iron bars. Protesters thenattacked with firebombs, and several officers were set ablaze. Thefires were put out quickly by other troopers.   Protesters knocked down parts of the school's wall to makeammunition to hurl at police. Police set up iron barricades in thestreets to hold students back during the fighting, which lasted morethan an hour.   Also today, opposition leader Kim Dae-jung demanded that theUnited States apologize for its alleged role in a 1980 pro-democracycivil uprising in the southern city of Kwangju that left about 200people dead. Kim is head of the largest opposition group, the Partyfor Peace and Democracy.   Kim likened recent incidents in China to the 1980 civil uprisingin Kwangju, the capital city of his home province, South Cholla.   One day after Kim and many opposition figures were arrested bymartial law authorities on May 17, 1980, student-led demonstratorsin Kwangju rose up against the government, drove out police andseized control of the city. Tank-led army troops ended the revolt innine days.   Kim and many government critics believe the United Statesacquiesced in the military suppression of the Kwangju revolt. Theysay a South Korean army division under operational control of thetop U.S. army commander in Seoul was used to crush the Kwangjuuprising.   The United States had denied the allegations.</TEXT></DOC>
