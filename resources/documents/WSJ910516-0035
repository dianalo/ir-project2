Profit in the quarter ended April 28 was $76.4 million, or60 cents a share, compared with $54.6 million, or 42 cents ashare, a year earlier. Sales rose 3% to $1.52 billion,excluding divested and discontinued businesses.</LP><TEXT>   The consensus on Wall Street had been that Campbell wouldearn 55 cents a share, but the higher-than-anticipatedresults nonetheless drew scant praise from some analysts.They questioned the durability of Campbell's turnaround,noting that the record earnings were achieved almost entirelythrough improved margins, rather than from sales and volumegrowth.   &quot;Margin improvements aren't sustainable after a certainpoint,&quot; said William Leach, an analyst at Donaldson Lufkin andamp;Jenrette Securities. &quot;Eventually, they will have to get thetop line going again.&quot;   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Campbellslipped $1 to $76.375.   Campbell North America, the largest division whichaccounted for about 85% of earnings, reported a 36% increasein operating profit, to $143.7 million. Unit volume in thecore soup business rose a healthy 4% in the quarter, helpedby the timing of trade promotions and advertising. But on anine-month basis volume was flat.   In Campbell North America's other big businesses, unitvolume of convenience meals, which includes Swansons, Le Menuand Mrs. Paul's, fell 8% in the quarter. Volume in thecompany's grocery business, which includes Prego spaghettisauce and V-8 juice, fell 8% as did volume at PepperidgeFarm.   Donaldson Lufkin's Mr. Leach noted that advertising andpromotion expenditures were down between 1% asnd 2% in thethird quarter and added: &quot;When you look at the volume trends,they shouldn't be cutting back on advertising, but to someextent it appears that they are milking the business tosatisfy the Dorrances.&quot;   Campbell's founding Dorrance family controls 60% of thecompany's stock. For more than a year, certain dissidentfamily members with a 14% stake have been pressing for thesale of the company.   Leonard Griehs, Campbell's director of investor relations,disagreed with Mr. Leach's observations on the advertisingcutback. &quot;If you look at the history of our advertising andmarketing, we went up 15% a year for the past few years andgot no volume out of it,&quot; he said. &quot;What we are doing now isto be disciplined about ad spending and our plans are tofocus on profitable volume.&quot;   For the nine months, Campbell's net rose 33% to $316.8million, or $2.49 a share, up from $242.8 million, or $1.87 ashare. Sales rose 6% to $4.86 billion, excluding divested anddiscontinued businesses.</TEXT></DOC>
