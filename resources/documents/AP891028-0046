Ferguson said ``well over'' 300,000 students are registered totake the Enhanced ACT Assessment test nationwide today. Mostcolleges in 28 U.S. states weigh the ACT test results in theirapplication procedures.   The new ACT test includes 215 questions and takes 2 hours and 55minutes to complete. The old test had 219 questions and took 2hours and 40 minutes.   Work on the new exam began seven or eight years ago and ACTofficials have studied, surveyed and tested it over the last threeor four years, Ferguson said.   ``There won't be surprises for us,'' he said. ``We know how itwill work.''   The new test will give more detailed information on students tohigh schools and colleges, Ferguson said.   The English section includes questions that measure a student'sawareness of decisions a person makes when writing, including styleand audience.   The range of questions has increased in the math section toinclude easier and more difficult questions and has been lengthenedby 10 questions and 10 minutes.   The new reading section includes fiction and readings in thehumanities.   The knowledge-of-facts items have been dropped from the ScienceReasoning section, which now focuses on the process of science. Thesection still includes material from science areas covered in highschool.   The enhanced test also includes subscores in English, math andreading, which the old test did not compile.   ACT officials expect higher scores but say it is not easier.   ``On the average, the test will not be more difficult than itwas before. We are simply testing some different things,'' Fergusonsaid.   Overall scoring has changed so that a 15 composite score lastyear might be comparable to an 18 composite this year, officialssaid. The range is from 1 to 36.</TEXT></DOC>
