The earth's responseto the observed deglaciation history is predicted using a 3-D viscoelasticmodel, in which the mantle viscosity and lithosphere thickness is allowedto vary. Agreement with the uplift data is achieved by a lithospherethickness of 90 km, a 75km channel of viscosity 0,7 x 10/sup 2/0 poisein the upper mantle, and a low viscosity lower mantle. 14 drawings, 19references.</TEXT></DOC>
