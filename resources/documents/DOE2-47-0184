Safety requirements forprevention of spontaneous combustion and explosions are outlined. Detailsof cable line installation concern maximum wire length, current at linefault, use of cable ducts made from plastics or rubber, insulation, sealingof connections, arrangement of wiring, use of passive fire protection(cable coating and mortar), cable supports and cable ducts from one buildingroom to the next. Cable ducts through walls and ceilings have to ensurethat fire and explosion safety of rooms is not diminished. Examples forsealing electric cable ducts (by mineral wool, mortar, water glass etc)are provided. Specific dust deposition on cables is further shown ina graph, with the conclusion made that cables in a diameter 25 mm orhigher have to be installed as a separate line in order to prevent dustbuildup. Details of installing electric cables in closed-in belt conveyorsare given along with a drawing of cable arrangement.</TEXT></DOC>
