Mr. North, the former National Security Council stafferwho was at the heart of the scandal, makes the assertion in abook that is being released this week. He claims that he wasimplicitly and explicitly pressured by superiors and Reagansupporters to exonerate the former president from blame inthe scandal, in which funds from secret arms sales to Iranwere diverted to support Contra rebels in Nicaragua at a timewhen U.S. aid to the rebels was banned.</LP><TEXT>   The book also discloses the existence of a phoneconversation, accidentally taped by a private bank'sautomatic recording system, in which two men seem to discussPresident Reagan's knowledge of the affair. In thatconversation, one speaker, indicating he has just testifiedbefore the congressional committees investigating thescandal, declares that &quot;Reagan knows. Reagan has all thememos.&quot; But Mr. North claims that the identities of the twomen in the recorded conversation couldn't be clearlyestablished and that the recording couldn't be used in court.   But excerpts of the book released over the weekend by Timemagazine, which is publishing them this week, don't disclosefurther evidence of direct presidential knowledge beyond whatMr. North previously discussed in his own testimony beforethe congressional committees in July 1987. At that time, Mr.North said, &quot;I thought that I had received authority from thepresident&quot; for the diversion of funds to the Contras. And hedisclosed that he had written five different memos in 1986seeking presidential approval.   In the book, Mr. North declares, &quot;And now, five yearslater, I am even more convinced: President Reagan kneweverything. Ronald Reagan knew of and approved a great dealof what went on with both the Iranian initiative and privateefforts on behalf of the Contras . . . I have no doubt thathe was told about the use of residuals for the Contras, andthat he approved it. Enthusiastically.&quot; &quot;Residuals&quot; is theterm Mr. North used -- rather than &quot;diversion&quot; -- to describethe money from Iranian arms sales that was sent to theContras.   The main difference between Mr. North's testimony in 1987and his account in the book, called &quot;Under Fire,&quot; seems to bea sharp decline in his willingness to give Mr. Reagan a clearopening to deny detailed knowledge.   No one could be reached for comment at Mr. Reagan's officein California.   In his congressional testimony, Mr. North stressedrepeatedly that he had no indication that any of his memos onthe diversion of funds ever reached Mr. Reagan and that noneever was returned with an indication of approval by thepresident. &quot;I want to make it very clear that no memorandumever came back to me with the president's initials on it, orthe president's name on it or a note from the president onit. None of these memoranda.&quot; When congressionalinvestigators tried repeatedly to extract from the formerMarine lieutenant colonel a hint that Mr. Reagan had beentold, Mr. North parried the questions.   But the book excerpts indicate that Mr. North feels badlyserved by the Reagan White House. He portrays himself as ascapegoat and complains that Mr. Reagan &quot;sure as hell wasn'tsupportive.&quot; In fact, he asserts that the Reagan teampurposely focused attention on the diversion of Iranianarms-sales funds to the Contras in an attempt to distract thenation from the president's knowledge of the broader effortsto arm the Contras and help Iran in an effort to win freedomfor American hostages in the Middle East.   While Mr. North directs his ire at President Reagan, whohas left office, there isn't any indication from the excerptsthat his book further implicates President Bush, who was vicepresident at the time. Mr. Bush's office plays a part in oneepisode, though. Mr. North asserts that a &quot;military aide&quot; tothe then-vice president approached him and his lawyer inDecember 1986 and urged Mr. North to &quot;waive my FifthAmendment rights and absolve&quot; Mr. Reagan of responsibility inthe Iran-Contra affair.   Mr. North doesn't identify the Bush aide. He cites thatincident as one of three in which he was directly urged toexonerate Mr. Reagan. He says Texas businessman H. Ross Perotalso met with him and his lawyer to urge him to say &quot;thepresident doesn't know&quot; and to offer to take care of Mr.North's family and give him a job afterward if he went tojail as a result. In addition, Mr. North asserts that formerSen. Paul Laxalt, a close friend of Mr. Reagan, once sent alegal memorandum that he wouldn't be waiving his FifthAmendment rights against self-incrimination if &quot;I chose tostate publicly that the president did not know about thediversion.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
