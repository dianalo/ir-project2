ARREST OFKING  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  California News.  </MEMO><TEXT>     Pacifica Hospital records indicate the darts were thrown out the night ofthe beating, Mike Botula, a spokesman for the District Attorney's Office, saidSunday.;    Briseno, Sgt. Stacey C. Koon and officers Timothy Wind andLaurence M. Powell pleaded not guilty to felony assault charges in the March 3beating of King during a traffic stop in Lake View Terrace.;    The Taserstun-gun darts are significant because their apparent failure to affect Kingmay have led officers to believe he was under the influence of thehallucinogenic drug PCP, Barnett said.;    &quot;If they reasonably believed he wasunder the influence of PCP, then the level of force and the amount of forcethat is permitted is far different,&quot; Barnett said.;    Botula dismissed thedarts' importance.;    &quot;We do not consider it a make-or-break bit of evidence.We certainly don't believe in the dismissal of charges,&quot; Botula said. &quot;Whatwe're looking at is the overall conduct of the officers.&quot;;    A witness'svideotape of the beating indicates King was hit more than 50 times with policebatons. King was taken to Pacifica Hospital in Sun Valley for treatment of hisinjuries.;    Prosecutors planned today to file responses to the dismissalrequest and other defense motions. A hearing on the motions is scheduled forMay 6.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Los Angeles  </CITY><EDITION>  South County  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910429  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  285  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday April 29, 199100120108,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
