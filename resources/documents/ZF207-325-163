(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>MANAGE THOSE FILESandM;Since saving and retrieving files are among the first tasks a 1-2-3 novicelearns, it's safe to assume that you are familiar with the File menu.andP;  Buthave you ever used a wild card to retrieve a file or tried to combine aportion of one file into another?andP;  Do you know about the File commands thatsave you the trouble of exiting to DOS to accomplish file- anddata-management chores?andP;  If not, read on for a review of each option on theFile menu shown in figure 1.andM;Many of the File commands prompt you for a file name, which consists of twoparts: a one-to-eight-character descriptive name and a three-characterfile-name extension.andP;  You select the file name.andP;  1-2-3 automatically suppliesthe appropriate file-name extension: WK1 (in 1-2-3 Release 1A, WKS) for aworksheet file, PRN for a print file, and PIC for a graph file.andM;File names and extensions can contain any combination of letters and numbers,plus the underscore character.andP;  1-2-3 Release 2/2.01 accepts these additionalcharacters: ! @ # $ % * andamp; ( ) - [ ] [is approx.] ' '  The following areexamples of valid file names: SALESFIG.WKS (1-2-3 Release 1A worksheet file)A5.PRN (print file) 4-4-88.PIC (graph file) COSTS[2].WK1 (1-2-3 Release2/2.01 worksheet file)andM;RETRIEVING WORKSHEETSandM;When you select /File Retrieve, 1-2-3 displays a list of all worksheet filesin the current directory, as well as the names of all the othersubdirectories.andP;  To select a file, highlight the file name and press Return.andO;1-2-3 loads the file into memory and displays it on the screen.andP;  To get alist of the files in any listed subdirectory, highlight the subdirectory nameand press Return.andP;  To select a file in that subdirectory, highlight the filename and press Return.andP;  Alternatively, you can type the file name and pressReturn.andM;1-2-3 file lists appear on one line.andP;  If you have more files andsubdirectories than fit across the line, use the arrow keys to scroll thepointer through the list.andP;  For a full list like the one figure 2, press theNAME key and use the arrow keys to move the pointer through the list.andP;  Thename, size, and time and date of creation of the highlighted file appear atthe top of the list.andM;When you are retrieving a worksheet, you can use the two wild-cardcharacters, the question mark and the asterisk, to restrict the files listed.andO;The question mark stands for any single character; the asterisk stands for aseries of characters.andP;  For example, if you had a disk with files namedINV.WK1, INV1.WK1, and INV_JUNE.WK1, INV*.WK1 causes all three files to belisted, whereas INV?.WK1 lists only INV1.WK1.andM;Here are some examples of how you can use wild-card characters:andM;*.* instructs 1-2-3 to display all files regardless of their names andfile-name extensions.andM;*.WK? instructs 1-2-3 to display all files with a WK extension followed byany single character.andM;????.PRN instructs 1-2-3 to display all files with a four-character name anda PRN extension.andM;INV*.WK1 instructs 1-2-3 to display all 1-2-3 Release 2/2.01 worksheet fileswhose names begin with INV.andM;Note that the appearance of a file name doesn't mean you can retrieve thefile.andP;  If you try to retrieve a PRN file, for example, you'll get the errormessage Not a valid worksheet file.andP;  You must select /File Import to retrievea PRN file.andM;If you use 1-2-3 Release 2/2.01, you can retrieve worksheet files created inearlier releases of 1-2-3 or in Symphony by using *.WK? as the filespecification.andP;  When you save the file, 1-2-3 Release 2/2.01 warns you thatit will save it under the same file name but with a WK1 file extension.andO;Therefore you end up with two copies, one with the original file-nameextension, which does not contain your latest changes, and one with the WK1extension, which does contain your latest changes.andM;SAVING WORKSHEETSandM;When you create a worksheet, it is temporarily stored in RAM.andP;  When you exitfrom 1-2-3 or turn off your computer, you lose whatever is currently in RAM.andO;To save a copy of a file to a floppy or hard disk, use the File Save command.andM;When you save a worksheet for the first time, you must assign it a name.andO;After you select /File Save, 1-2-3 prompts you to enter a file name.andP;  Inaddition, 1-2-3 displays a list of the existing files in the currentdirectory.andP;  Enter a file name and press Return.andP;  1-2-3 appends the extension.WK1 (in 1-2-3 Release a 1A, .WKS), saves the file on the disk, and returnsto Ready mode.andP;  If you specify a name already in use, 1-2-3 gives you achance to cancel the File Save operation or replace the existing file withthe current worksheet.andM;If you try to save a file you previously named, 1-2-3 assumes that you wantto save it under the existing name and displays Enter save file name,followed by the current directory (the current directory doesn't appear in1-2-3 Release 1A) and the existing file name.andP;  To accept that name, pressReturn.andP;  To specify a new file name, press Escape to erase the displayed filename and enter a new one.andM;EXTRACTING PORTIONS OF WORKSHEETSandM;Sometimes a file is so cumbersome that you need to chop it into moremanageable chunks.andP;  Use the File Xtract command to save a portion of aworksheet in a separate worksheet file.andM;The File Xtract command prompts you to supply the format that the commandshould use for the extracted data (formulas or values), a file name, and arange.andP;  Extracting formulas saves the current worksheet's formulas, labels,numbers, and results of formulas in the new worksheet.andP;  Extracting valuessaves labels, numbers, and only the results of the current worksheet'sformulas in the new worksheet.andP;  After you select either formulas or values,specify a file name for the new worksheet and indicate the range of cells tobe extracted.andP;  To indicate a range, you can use Point mode to highlight thearea, enter the range address (for example, A1..C2000), or enter a namedrange.andP;  1-2-3 saves the range you specify under the file name you indicated.andO;The original worksheet file remains unchanged.andM;When you extract formulas, all cell references, whether relative or absolute,adjust to reflect their new positions in the worksheet.andP;  For example, if youextract range D4..F7, the contents of those cells will be in range A1..C4 inthe new worksheet.andP;  If cell D4 contains the formula + E4, then cell A1 in thenew worksheet will contain the formula + B1.andM;COMBINING WORKSHEETSandM;The File Combine command lets you combine all or part of an existing fileinto the current worksheet.andP;  After you select /File Combine, you may chooseto copy, add, or subtract the incoming values.andM;The Copy option replaces the contents of cells in the current worksheet withthe contents of the corresponding cells in the incoming worksheet.andP;  However,a blank cell in the incoming worksheet does not overwrite the correspondingcell in the current worksheet.andM;The Add option adds the incoming values to the values in the correspondingcells in the current worksheet.andP;  An incoming value replaces a blank cell.andP;  Anincoming cell that is blank or that contains a label or label-returningstring formula does not affect the current worksheet.andM;The Subtract option subtracts the incoming values from the existing values inthe current worksheet.andP;  As you might expect, a positive incoming valuesubtracted from a blank cell produces a negative result.andM;After you select /File Combine and specify copy, add, or subtract, you mustindicate whether you want to merge the entire incoming file or just a namedrange (for example, budget) or specified range (for example, A1..B200).andP;  Ifyou select the latter, enter a named range or range address.andP;  In 1-2-3Release 1A, you can choose to combine the entire file or a named range.andM;Next, 1-2-3 prompts you for the name of the incoming file.andP;  You can eitherenter the incoming file name or highlight the file name.andP;  The upper-left cellin the incoming file or range is combined into the cell containing the cellpointer.andP;  The remainder of the incoming file or range is combined into thecorresponding positions below and to the right of this cell.andP;  If youaccidentally position the pointer so that the combined file operation extendspast the right or bottom worksheet boundaries, you get a Worksheet full errormessage.andM;The File Combine operation can be a little tricky.andP;  As a precautionarymeasure, save the file before you combine another file with it.andP;  And rememberthat while 1-2-3 is executing the File Combine command, the incoming file orrange and the current file remain intact on the disk.andP;  If you fail to get theresults you want, don't save the worksheet.andP;  Instead, retrieve the file intowhich you want to combine the incoming file and start over.andP;  For more on thefile combine command, see &quot;Getting It All Together with File Combine&quot;(January 1987).andM;IMPORTING A FILEandM;The File Import command makes it possible for you to pull data into thecurrent worksheet from an ASCII text file, which most word processors andmany other programs, including 1-2-3, can create.andP;  The data appears at thelocation of the cell pointer.andM;The File Import command can handle text or numbers.andP;  If you select /FileImport Numbers, 1-2-3 searches the ASCII file for labels enclosed inquotation marks and for numbers.andP;  Each number appears in a cell as a value;each quoted label appears in a cell as a label.andP;  Characters in the incomingfile that are not quoted are ignored.andP;  Look at the adjacent ASCII file namedSALES:andM;If you're in a blank worksheet with the cell pointer in cell A1, select /FileImport Numbers, and specify the file SALES.andP;  Here are the results:andM;The labels Month, Sales, January, and February appear in cells A1, B1, A2,and A3, respectively.andP;  The value 1345 appears in cell B2, 1422 appears incell B3, and 2767 appears in cell A4.andP;  However, because the word total wasnot enclosed in quotation marks in the original file, 1-2-3 ignored it.andM;The File Import Text command imports each line in an ASCII file as a single,left-aligned label.andP;  This results in a column of long labels.andM;DIRECTORY, LIST, ERASEandM;The File Directory, File List, and File Erase commands are utilities thathelp you manage your 1-2-3 files.andM;The File Directory command lets you change the default 1-2-3 directory forthe current work session.andP;  This command is handy.andP;  Suppose your globaldefault directory setting is C:\123files.andP;  Each time you use a 1-2-3 Filecommand, the program automatically assumes that you want to work with filesin the subdirectory 123files.andP;  What if, for one work session, you want toaccess files on a floppy disk in drive A?andP;  Use the File Directory command tochange the default directory setting to A:\.andM;The File List command displays a list of files in the current directory.andP;  Tolist all files, select /File List Other.andP;  You may choose to limit the listingto worksheet, graph, or print files.andP;  1-2-3 automatically displays afull-screen list.andP;  As you move the pointer through the list, the name, size,and time and date of the file's creation appear.andM;Finally, when you're sure you no longer need a particular file, use the FileErase command to delete it.andP;  You can also use the wild-card characters (? and*) to ease your file deletion chores.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
