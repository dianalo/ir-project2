The decision, announced by Assistant Secretary of State AllenHolmes to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, was viewed as adesire to influence a handful of sanctions bills that appear tostand a good chance of approval.   It also reflected the conciliatory tone adopted by the newadministration toward Congress on foreign policy issues such as theagreement reached between the White House and Congress last monthfor aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.   ``We ... welcome the opportunity to work with Congress tostrengthen our tools for combatting CW (chemical weapons)proliferation,'' Holmes said. ``In doing so, we accept in principlethat some form of sanctions, if appropriately formulated, wouldgive the administration an additional instrument against countriesthat use CW and companies that aid proliferation.''   The president already has open to him sanctions he can invokeagainst countries that produce and use chemical weapons. He hasimposed such sanctions against Libya, Syria, Iraq and Iran inrecent years.   But in light of revelations that Iraq used nerve gas and otherchemical weapons against its Kurdish minority and against Iranduring the nine-year Gulf war, Congress wants to legislatemandatory sanctions.   The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen.Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., and the ranking Republican on the panel,Jesse Helms of North Carolina, introduced two sanctions billsfollowing revelations last year that West German firms had helpedLibya build a chemical weapons plant near the town of Rabta.   Both bills will probably be voted on next month. There are alsoseveral other similar measures in the Senate and House, all ofwhich would impose automatic penalties on countries and companies.   ``There's a lot of sentiment in Congress to take the whole thingout of the president's hands and just mandate it,'' said Rep. DanteFascell, D-Fla., chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.Nonetheless, he praised ``signs of hope and change both in Congressand in the executive branch,'' and said ``my hope is that we willbe able to join together in adopting a comprehensive policy.''   Holmes argued that mandatory, automatic sanctions would tie thepresident's hands. ``He has got to be able to tailor our responsesto individual circumstances and individual countries,'' Holmes said.   Mandatory sanctions would also hamper U.S. attempts to rallyother countries around a global chemical weapons ban beingnegotiated in Geneva and around various export-control measuresbeing debated by the so-called Australia Group.   The group, which is comprised of the 12-nation European EconomicCommunity, the United States, Japan, Canada, Norway andSwitzerland, is meeting in Paris next week.</TEXT></DOC>
