Twenty-eight armygenerals were fired.   Brig. Gen. Omar Hassan Ahmed el-Bashir told a meeting of seniorgovernment officials that the peace overtures begun last month byPrime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi, whom he toppled on Friday, were``political machinations and not serious.''   The 6-year-old war crippled the economy and led to widespeadfamine that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives.   The brigadier general, 44, led a military junta of 15 officers inthe bloodless coup, the fourth military upheaval in Sudan's 33 yearsof independence.   Calling itself the command council of the National SalvationRevolution, the junta immediately assumed dictatorial powers,including a ban on dissent.   The National Salvation Revolution council today announced thefiring of 28 army generals, including the commander-in-chief, Gen.Fat'hi Ahmed Ali, and the chief of staff, Gen. Babu Nimir, a strongsupporter of el-Mahdi.   The meet was broadcast over official Radio Omdurman.   Khartoum remained under a nighttime curfew decreed after thecoup, but the city appeared returning to normal today despite tightsecurity.   Hundreds of troops were seen on the streets, stopping andsearching cars. Tanks and armored cars were posted at thepresidential palace, army headquarters and bridges spanning theWhite Nile and Blue Nile rivers.   Telex and telephone communications with Khartoum, cut immediatelyafter the coup, were restored today. Khartoum Airport reopened foreight hours today for planes carrying Moslem pilgrims to SaudiArabia but remained closed to other international traffic.   El-Bashir criticized el-Mahdi's efforts to negotiate peace withsouthern rebels at a meeting of government undersecretaries. But hemade clear that his government is committed to peace.   ``Our primary goal is peace, and we (the army) are the peoplemostly suffering from war,'' he said. ``I will enlist the help ofall experts in the quest for peace.''   Radio Omdurman frequently interrupted its programming tobroadcast messages of support from military units for el-Bashir.   The coup leaders on Friday issued decrees that suspended theconstitution and shut down independent newspapers. They bannedpolitical parties, declared a national state of emergency and theindefinite nighttime curfew.   El-Bashir named himself prime minister, defense minister andarmed forces commander.   The fate of el-Mahdi following the coup remained unclear. Onereport said he escaped arrest. Another said he was seen being drivenfrom his home by soldiers.   In Washington, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler of the U.S. StateDepartment alluded Friday to reports that a number of Cabinetminister were arrested.   ``We regret the military is taking action to overthrow Sudan'sdemocratically elected government, and we urge an early return todemocracy,'' she said.   El-Bashir has pledged a non-partisan government and goodrelations with all countries. He made no mention of restoringcivilian rule.   The coup leaders have disavowed any connection with the formermilitary dictator, President Gaafar Nimeiri, who was ousted by histop generals in April 1985.   Nimeiri, in power for 16 years, recently pledged from exile inCairo to overthrow el-Mahdi and return to power. A Nimeiri aidereached by telephone said the former president was in the Egyptiancapital but unavailable for comment.   El-Bashir is said to be apolitical, although he is a member ofthe religious sect that forms the power base of the oppositionDemocratic Unionists.   Another Cairo newspaper, Al-Gomhuriya, described el-Bashir as a``well-liked, sociable'' officer who studied in the Soviet Union butis considered anti-communist.   A former commander of paratroopers fighting in the civil war insouthern Sudan, el-Bashir was the third-ranking officer in the corpsbefore the coup.   The war has caused widespread famine and turned many southernersinto refugees.   Like most ranking Sudanese officers and government officials,Bashir is a northern Moslem of Arab extraction. The rebels areChristians and animists of African descent who demand more autonomyfor the south.</TEXT></DOC>
