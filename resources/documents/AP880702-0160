MILLER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A committee including U.S. lawmakersfrom the Democratic Party urged the Reagan administration Saturdayto end sanctions against Panama, saying the measures are destroyingthat country's middle class.   Patrick J. Lucey, former governor of Wisconsin and ambassador toMexico during the Carter administration, called the sanctions ``anunloaded gun pointed at Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.'' Noriega isthe commander of Panama's Defense Forces and controls the civiliangovernment.   Lucey called on President Reagan to appoint a special envoy toexamine the situation first-hand and to recommend changes in ``whatis clearly a policy gone awry.''   Lucey and four other members of the ``July 4th EmergencyCommittee for Justice in Panama'' issued a report in San Josefollowing a three-day visit to Panama that ended Friday night.   The report said the sanctions were devastating the privatebusiness sector and causing suffering among workers who lost theirjobs because of private business closings.   ``Thus U.S. policy is leading thousands of Panamanian workers toview private enterprise as less attractive than working for thegovernment,'' the report said.   Washington imposed economic sanctions on Panama earlier thisyear in an attempt to force Noriega out of office following hisindictments by federal grand juries in Florida last February thataccused the general of drug trafficking.   Lucey is the founder and one of three co-chairmen of thecommittee for justice in Panama. Another co-chairman is GeorgeMcGovern, a former Democratic senator and presidential candidatefrom South Dakota.   Lucey is pledged as a delegate to Michael Dukakis and has workedactively in the Massachusetts governor's presidential campaign forthe Democratic nomination. He denied, however, that his committeewas tied to either the Dukakis campaign or the Democratic NationalCommittee.   He said his group proposed no solutions and its mission was ``toassess the damage caused by the sanctions to the Panamanianeconomy, to the Panamanian social structure, to the Panamanianpeople and to U.S.-Panamanian relations.''   The report said the committee ``strongly supports the objectiveof seeing that Gen. Noriega ... is brought to justice,'' buteconomic sanctions have left him firmly in power.   It also claimed the sanctions were forcing Panamanian importersto seek supply channels other than the United States, leading tocloser ties between Panama and ``opportunistic Arab countries'' aswell as Japan.   Other committee members include Rep. Robert Kastenmeier (D-Wis.)and three Democratic state legislators from Colorado: Philip A.Fernandez, Tony Hernandez and Robert Martinez.</TEXT></DOC>
