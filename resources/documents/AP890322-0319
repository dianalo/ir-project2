On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May contract for WestTexas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, finishedoff 1 cent at $20.04 a barrel after gaining 71 cents on Tuesday.   Refined petroleum products traded on the exchange had a bettershowing.   Heating oil for April delivery rose 0.57 cent to 56 cents agallon. The April contract for unleaded gasoline rose 0.21 cent to57.35 cents a gallon.   Linda Simard, an energy broker at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,said many traders had expected a big sell-off after Tuesday's strongperformance but the market held up well despite industry figuresthat showed a buildup in crude oil stocks.   The American Petroleum Institute reported late Tuesday after themarket closed that crude oil stocks expanded by 7.1 million barrelsin the week ended March 17. Heating oil declined 1.2 million barrelsand gasoline slipped by 630,000 barrels.   ``Everybody was expecting a big sell-off but the market lookssteady,'' she said.   Crude oil ended the day significantly above its lowest levels ofthe session; the May contract had been down more than 30 cents atone point.   Traders said speculative buying interest and a belief thatfundamentally the market is strong due to OPEC's apparent success inabiding by its production quota has supported the market.   Energy market participants have expressed optimism that theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries can stick to itsagreement to lower production.   In an attempt to shore up oil prices that had been weighed downby an abundance of oil on world markets, the cartel last yearestablished a new lower output quota.   OPEC's new quota of 18.5 million barrels a day took effect Jan. 1and extends for six months. Reports last month indicated the cartelwas still producing above 19 million barrels, but new estimates arethat OPEC output is closer to the target.</TEXT></DOC>
