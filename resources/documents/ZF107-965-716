 A critical piece of a projectrunning hopelessly over deadline, jamming up all of the other pieces.andP;  Asupplier that fails to deliver on time or fails to deliver at all.andP;  Inventorythat's eating up the budget like Godzilla going through Tokyo.andM;In the best of times, failure to optimally manage complex projects can leadto such corporate nightmares.andP;  In next year's economic grind, such failuresmay very well make or break the next crucial project, let alone the projectmanager.andM;But there is hope.andP;  Project management software, the corporate Holy Grail,will give managers clear vision to recognize, prepare for and respond to thesnags that inevitably occur in the course of any extensive undertaking,whether it is developing that new software application or building the HooverDam.andM;In recent interviews, experienced users of project management packages cite aplethora of benefits, including full return on investment in a matter ofmonths, increased project control, decreased costs, improved quality andbetter employee communication.andP;  And these benefits cut across allfunctions--from research and development to manufacturing--in virtually everyindustry.andM;More and more companies are evaluating whether the technology can help themnegotiate the life cycle of their projects.andP;  In today's corporate climate,project management software is rapidly moving out from under the hard hat andinto the boardroom, bank and laboratory as projects become increasinglycomplex, delays more fiscally dangerous and quality demands ever morestringent.andM;In fact, the Sierra Group, a market research and consulting company in Tempe,Ariz., recently conducted a survey of MIS managers in a wide range of fieldsindicating that 27.3 percent of 1,327 respondents plan to purchase projectmanagement software.andM;Those findings contrast sharply with a study conducted by ComputerIntelligence, a market research company in La Jolla, Calif., of current usersin the United States, in which only 1.5 percent of the 12,000 VAX sitescanvassed report using project management software.andP;  The software industryand CASE environments, long beset by missed deadlines and overextendedresources, are among the first to join the established ranks of projectmanagement users in the construction and utility industries.andM;Although converts to computerized project management extol its virtues,first-time users must realize that the software package is no substitute fora well-constructed project plan.andP;  Successful implementation depends on theproject manager's fundamental understanding of the entire project, how toperform the tasks that make up the project and how to integrate the projectmanagement tool effectively into the structure of the corporation performingthe project.andM;The project management package is a resource-tracking and status-checkingfacility whose most important function is to provide information to theproject managers.andP;  The information provided by the software gives themanagers a quantitative global and historical view of activities andresources.andP;  With this information, they can then monitor and adjust anenterprise's ongoing efforts.andM;Like any other program, however, the project management application will beonly as good as the creator's logical construct and the user'simplementation.andM;In short, project management software may help managers identify and head offproblems at the pass but it cannot tell them how to wage the fight.andM;Moreover, project management software is a tool that could embody one ofseveral methodologies.andP;  When evaluating a package, it's important to match apackage's project management methodology with the job at hand.andP;  Utilizedcorrectly, project management software provides an accurate means ofscheduling and managing individual tasks; helps users work together andcommunicate in a more standardized, effective manner; and increases anunderstanding of the company's goals and how to meet them.andM;Despite the rousing qualitative and quantitative advantages of a computerizedproject management system, the benefits come neither quickly, easily norcheaply.andP;  A typical 12-user system, consisting of a MicroVAX 3400, projectmanagement software from a leading vendor, training and consulting, can runmore than $115,000.andM;An initial $12,000 software investment in a low-end VAX-based projectmanagement software system for a five-user site can easily grow to more than$70,000 when hardware, training and consulting are added in.andM;Getting started also requires an investment of time.andP;  Software evaluation andselection, installation, user training, standardization of report formats andprocedures, and data entry all require an up-front investment.andP;  This can takehalf a year or more and can cost as much as $30,000.andM;However, this investment can be worthwhile if managers carefully plan theintroduction of project management methodology and software to deliver apayback-- usually within two years--that more than justifies the investment.andM;For example, a report by Duncan Associates, a consulting company inLexington, Mass., cites a client corporation that spent considerable timeimplementing both a project management methodology and software.andM;Before implementing project management, the company tracked the course ofseveral manufacturing projects, and the managers realized that thecorporation was typically spending $1 million to $1.5 million on projectsoriginally budgeted at $400,000 to $500,000.andP;  The company determined thatusing a project management methodology and software could cut that margin oferror to less than 15 percent.andP;  The company is now estimating projects moreaccurately, and it no longer spends money on projects that would produce alow return.andM;In another application, a large defense electronics company uses projectmanagement techniques for resource analysis.andP;  The company is earning bonusesby finishing projects before the completion dates specified in its contracts.andO;Consequently, the company estimates it is gaining income of between $500,000and $600,000 per project, income that otherwise would have been lost.andM;A project manager at a U.S.andP;  nuclear utility plant used project managementsoftware to design and implement a just-in-time delivery system for theconstruction of a new nuclear facility.andP;  The savings over 10 years totaledapproximately $500 million.andM;According to officials at a Tennessee manufacturing company, a conservativeestimate of a company's savings from using a project managementsystem--including hardware, software, time and personnel resources--rangesfrom 1.5 percent to 2 percent of its capital budget--for a total of $4million to $4.5 million a year.andM;These companies achieved their successes by recognizing that projectmanagement--not just project management software--is the key to return oninvestment.andP;  Employees who have a solid understanding of project managementterms and techniques are those most likely to make the best use of the tools.andO;(See &quot;Shifting High-Cost Activities,&quot; page 38.)andM;In its simplest form, a project is a number of tasks that need to becompleted within a defined timeframe to achieve a distinct, measurable set ofobjectives.andP;  Project management is a methodology that consists of a number oftechniques, tools and processes used to assemble and control a project.andM;The Project management methodology evolved from the development of theProgram Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) and the critical Path Method(CPM) for better control of scheduling and costs and more effectivemanagement of large-scale systems development efforts.andM;PERT has its roots in World War II, when the U.S.andP;  Navy developed it tocoordinate large-scale, time-critical manufacturing efforts.andP;  At the time,PERT calculations were performed manually.andM;Ten years later, during the development of the Polaris missile weaponssystems, the Navy computerized PERT to coordinate the complex task-forcemanagement and deployment that was necessary for underwater weapons retrievalvia the Polaris submarine.andM;PERT uses three time estimates to predict a project's completion date.andP;  The&quot;earliest time given&quot; is an estimate of a project's completion date underideal conditions, the &quot;most likely time&quot; is the completion date under averageconditions, and the &quot;longest possible time&quot; shows a completion date based onMurphy's Law--as if anything that could go wrong did.andM;The project manager using PERT creates a probability distribution chart todetermine the best way to complete a project, usually based on the timeestimates.andM;CPM was developed in the commercial sector Managers at E.I.andP;  Du Pont deNemours andamp; Co. created CPM to manage construction and plant maintenanceturnaround.andP;  When the company closed a plant for repairs or renovation,managers used CPM to assess the costs associated with the shutdown and anyprojects scheduled for that facility, as well as how the shutdown wouldaffect the cost of the projects.andM;TAKE YOUR PICKandM;Today's project management techniques--and project management software--arebased on PERT and CPM.andP;  Each one provides a different method for movingthrough the event sequence of a project.andM;CPM identifies the interrelated activities and tasks (called critical events)that are indispensable to the project's completion and provides estimates ofhow long it will take to complete those activities.andP;  The duration of theproject is defined as the longest activities sequence (critical path).andM;The minimum amount of time needed to finish a project is determined by thecritical path.andP;  All of the events along this path have no float time toabsorb delays.andP;  Any interruptions in the completion of the critical eventscan delay the project and add to its costs.andM;CPM produces time and cost estimates for normal and emergency operations.andP;  Ifan emergency or delay occurs, the project manager can rearrange resources andevent times throughout the critical path to stay on schedule.andM;PERT's advantage over CPM is that it is often the more practical way toestimate critical paths because it is based on statistical probability.andP;  CPMforces the user to estimate activity lengths and resources in relation to oneanother.andP;  Some advanced CPM packages can now do probabilistic modeling, too.andM;Whether based on the CPM or PERT methods, the fundamental elements of projectmanagement are the same: project planning, time and resource estimation,basic scheduling, time/cost trade-offs, resource allocation and projectcontrol.andP;  With each method, changes and updates are made regularly to adjustand account for the differences between actual and projected progress.andM;Only the people directly involved in the project will know which solutionwill work best.andP;  The important point is that project management software letsmanagers familiar with the methodology quickly see the possible impact of arelatively minor change in resources.andP;  The software enables a manager torespond to changes with informed contingency plas that provide a realisticsolution in a minimal amount of time.andM;Evaluating and choosing project management software can be an exercise inproject management itself.andP;  (See &quot;Selecting Project Management Software, page43.)andM;Therefore, it's especially important for companies new to project managementmethodologies to ensure the effort is spearheaded by a consultant or managerwho is thoroughly familiar with the techniques.andP;  (See &quot;Charting TheImplementation of a Project Management System,&quot; page 35).andM;Throughout the process, the manager or consultant can teach and reinforce thefundamentals and details of project planning and can control and modelproject management skills as well.andM;By assigning a task force of future project management software users tooversee software evaluation and selection, managers can foster a sense ofteamwork and interdependency.andP;  This will later smooth the introduction anduse of project management techniques.andM;The time investment needed varies from company to company, generallyaveraging one work-month for companies that have an internal project managerwho is familiar with the process.andM;Despite the expense, which ranges from $800 to $1,500 per day (plus expense),companies that are unfamiliar with project management techniques might wantto hire a consultant to train department managers.andP;  (See &quot;Cost of Ownershipfor Multiuser Configurations,&quot; page 40.)andM;Project management consultants usually specialize in one or a few industries,and their experience can reduce the costs and frustration associated with anew technology by getting a project off to a good start.andP;  The ProjectManagement Institute in Drexel Hill, Penn., provides companies with lists ofconsultants and their areas of expertise.andM;Generally, the more industry-specific experience a consultant has, the higherhis or her fees will be.andP;  Ideally, the initial meeting with the consultantwould be a two- to three-day training session on project management thatemphasizes the management issues of teamwork; clear, consistentcommunication; employee empowerment; task identification; estimating;scheduling; and controlling.andM;During the initial meeting, participants should define the company's goalsand problems, then assess the nature of the projects to determine whichproject management techniques and software should be employed.andM;To encourage appreciation of the complexity of project management, it isuseful tot ake one project and break it down, showing the thousands of tasks,hundreds of resources and intricate dependencies and availabilities needed tocomplete the project.andP;  Managers will quickly realize that the ability toaccurately track resources, schedules and costs is crucial to complete theproject and reach corporate goals.andM;What will also become clear is the different requirements that projectmanagement software must meet for various levels of employees.andP;  For example,line managers will need a package that enables them to examine the details ofindividual activities.andP;  Project managers, however, often look for forecastingand earned value reporting components to ensure that projected overruns canbe found while it is still early enough to take corrective action.andO;High-level executives might want a capability that allows&quot;executive-friendly,&quot; presentation-quality, summarized status reports in aneasily understood format.andM;A &quot;requirements definition,&quot; or criteria, can be drafted to outline thecapabilities the ideal software package would have, such as the ability toschedule resources by weeks, days, hours and minutes; graphics; simulationand &quot;what if&quot; capabilities; and interfaces to mainframes or microcomputers.andM;Following the initial project planning and training meetings, companiesshould expect to bring the trainer back for regular, on-the-job training inthe form of periodic independent formal reviews of project status andperformance.andP;  Before formal project management begins, junior managers andsenior-level executives should also receive an abbreviated version of thetraining.andM;Although the project management software itself will cost anywhere from$1,200 for a simple PC-based package to $300,000 for high-end software, manyapplications will likely incur additional expenses because they requirecustomization.andM;This can be done in the initial stages of software implementation or afterusers have had a chance to get up to speed and determine what other resourcesthey need.andM;Expect to pay about $100 an hour to have a vendor customize software.andP;  Mostvendors need two to 40 hours to design customer interfaces and reports.andP;  Ifthe customization will take only a few hours, some vendors will customize thesoftware for free.andM;Companies can also hire consultants to customze the software.andP;  Of course,users who have a certain level of expertise can do the customizationthemselves.andP;  Most vendors offer some training in customization for about $800a day.andM;Maintenance costs and update fees are another area that can add to the costof a project management system.andP;  Usually incurred in the second year, theseexpenses run about $2,000 per year for low-end systems to $3,000 to $5,000per year for midrange systems.andP;  Prices vary depending on the vendor andnumber of users, but they are usually about 15 percent of the price of thelicense.andM;The cheaper packages are sufficient to handle relatively simple, short-term,one-user projects with a small number of activities, but a sophisticated,powerful package is required to handle complex, long-term, multiuserprojects.andP;  Most packages are interactive, and many allow managers to monitordifferent parts of a project simultaneously.andP;  (See &quot;Platforms Running ProjectManagement Software at Fortune 500 Sites,&quot; page 42.)andM;High-end packages frequently provide resource-leveling capabilities, whichlet project managers extend the use of high-cost resources like unionizedlabor over a specified period to avoid unnecessary costs such as overtime.andM;THE CHICKEN OR THE EGGandM;Scheduling capacity is often what separates high-end packages from low-endand midrange packages in terms of price and power.andP;  Companies that have largeprojects consisting of 2,000 activities or more need a program that can groupproject activities into logical categories easily.andM;Two popular methods for accomplishing this are organizational breakdownstructure (OBS) and work breakdown structure (WBS).andM;OBS can be used to highlight activities by criteria, such as job site, typeof work and location.andP;  An OBS organizational diagram of a software vendorwould show the functional departments within the company as a hierarchicaltree.andP;  For example, the departments could include research and development,testing and marketing.andM;By plotting tasks and planned achievements in ascending order of detail, WBSstructures activities into a hierarchy of work stages, then shows theintermediate phases and the activities those phases comprise.andM;For example, when developing a new product, a software company could use WBSto show which divisions could include development (such as functional andtechnical design), testing (unit, integration and volume testing),documentation, marketing (including research and ad design) and selling(hiring and training staff).andM;Project management software must be sophsticated and powerfulandM;Users Control Cost With Big SystemsandM;The respondents to DR Strategies' Project Management Poll tended to be fromlarge companies--more than 63 percent indicated annual revenues of $10million or more.andP;  Thirty-two percent said their company has annual revenuesof more than $100 million.andM;The respondents were fairly experienced; more than 71 percent said they havebeen using project management software for more than two years.andP;  Sixty-sixpercent said it took less than 11 months to implement their system, includingthe time spent selecting a vendor.andM;Surprisingly, nearly 70 percent indicated they did not hire a consultant tohelp implement their present project management system.andP;  Among the remaining30 percent, more than three-fourths said they spent more than $25,000 on aconsultant or on training.andM;Conducted by Beta Research of Syossett, N.Y., the survey covered VAX sitesselected randomly from a list provided by Computer Intelligence, a marketresearch company in La Jolla, Calif.andP;  Respondents were asked to identify thechief benefit of using a project management system.andP;  More than 63 percentsaid it was the ability to control costs.andP;  Sixty-one percent indicated thatproject management software improved communication among departments.andP;  Theability to quickly change plans came in third, at 55 percent.andP;  Another 54percent of the respondents said that using the software shortened the overalltime spent on projects.andP;  Fifty-four percent of the respondents said theirmajor concern about project management software was performance; 50 percentsaid they were dissatisfied with their user interface.andP;  Another 50 percentsaid the cost of administration and operation was too high.andP;  Forty-twopercent of the respondents expressed a desire for better scheduling features.andM;The construction, mining, oil, utility and engineering industries accountedfor 53 percent of the respondents.andP;  Government defense sites accounted for 17percent of the sites, followed by manufacturing at 16 percent.andP;  Financing andbanking represented 7 percent.andM;The number of projects tracked by the respondents at any one time was spreadfairly evenly in the range of two to 20.andP;  The largest group, 32 percent,indicated they track two to four projects at once.andP;  Forty-seven percent  ofthe respondents said their projects last longer than 18 months, and about 44percent said they track fewer than 50 resources at a time.andP;  Thirteen percenttrack more than 300 resources at a time.andM;Nearly 90 percent of those polled run project management software on a largeVAX;9 percent said they use more than one platform.andP;  About 15 percent saidthey developed their system in-house, and 13 percent use more than onecommercial program.andM;Improved Scheduling Brings BonusesandM;When they first broke into the general contracting and cement business,LaCheezi andamp; Sons Cement of Newark, N.J., struggled for a long time.andP;  Now,however, the fictitious, 50-employee company is suffering growing pains.andP;  Ithas missed out on some new business because its managers submitted bids late.andO;A recent project had so many scheduling foul-ups the company only narrowlyavoided late fines specified in the contract.andP;  The deadline was met, butLaCheezi failed to garner the lucrative early completion bonus.andM;Cement plant time, trucks, drivers, paving machines and laborers arescheduled by a project manager with the help of three clerks and adispatcher.andP;  The staff uses paper job logs, triplicate order forms andrequisitions filled out by drivers, dispatchers and site foremen to monitorresources and schedule jobs, such as maintenance.andP;  Raw materials arestockpiled two months ahead.andM;Last year, LaCheezi automated its office functions, and now the officemanager has determined that it could be cost-effective to invest in projectmanagement software that will run on the MicroVAX that LaCheezi already owns.andM;After analysis, the manager's choice comes down to one project managementsystem that has features necessary to keep LaCheezi pouring cement.andP;  The planinvolves buying a concurrent four-user project management system license for$18,900 plus $2,835 per year for maintenance beginning in the second year.andO;The manager determines that he will need to spend $10,500 for three dataentry terminals and two graphics terminals.andP;  A $4,000 terminal server willalso be needed, as well as a $3,900 plotter.andP;  Yearly hardware maintenancewill be $1,612, also beginning in the second year.andM;The office manager decides a consultant should be brought in to help withcoding and implementation.andP;  The total cost for six weeks will be $30,000.andO;One week of off-site training for four employees will also be scheduled, at acost of $7,500.andM;Using this model, LaCheezi decided it could hire a professional projectmanager to oversee the office at a cost of $70,000, including salary andbenefits.andP;  The manager's salary would be increased at the rate of 5 percent ayear.andM;As far as immediate savings go, the improved scheduling will allow LaCheezito cut the driver's overtime account by $51,000.andP;  Using the projectmanagement system's report writer feature, the company expects to submithighly detailed bids in a more timely fashion.andP;  Because the program willallow LaCheezi to implement an automated just-in-time program for thedelivery of cement-plant raw materials, carrying charges will be reduced by$9,800.andM;Again, by making better use of resources, LaCheezi expects to finish projectsahead of schedule and to earn substantial bonuses.andP;  A conservative estimateputs the bonus income at $45,000.andP;  First-year income and savings is estimatedat $165,800 which, in compliance with corporate guidelines, will be adjustedfor salary increases and inflation at the rate of 5 percent a year.andM;To evaluate the investment in a project management system, the office managercalculates a 15 percent discount rate for money and a cash flow value overfive years of $142,483.andM;Next he calculates the internal rate of return at a whopping 125.2 percent.andO;Payback on the initial investment comes in the first month of the secondyear.andP;  Clearly, LaCheezi andamp; Sons can't afford not to invest in a projectmanagement system.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
