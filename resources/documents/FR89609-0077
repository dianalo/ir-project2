This is a one-time collection.  <T3>Abstract: </T3>This action requests chemical data from manufacturersof chemicals and aqueous cleaners that can be substituted for fully halogenatedCFCs and halons. EPA will use the information to help assess environmentalrisks associated with the use and disposal of these products.  <T3>Burden Statement: </T3>The estimated public burden for this collectionof information is 8 hours per response.  <T3>Respondents: </T3>Manufacturers of substitutes for fully halogenatedCFCs and halons.  <T3>Estimated No. of Respondents: </T3>59.  <T3>Estimated Total Burden on Respondents: </T3>472 hours.  <T3>Frequency of Collection: </T3>One time only.  <T3>Expedited Review: </T3>The request for expedited review is made underthe Paperwork Reduction Act (5 CFR, 1320.18). The Office of Air and Radiationis requesting information under authority of section 114 of the Clean AirAct. The requested data is needed to assist Agency staff in assessing thehealth and safety hazards associated with substitutes for fully halogenatedCFCs and halons. EPA has contacted affected manufacturers and has discussedAgency plans for collecting the needed information. This fact combinedwith the need to prepare technical assessments for review by the internationalcommunity later this summer, demands expedited review under the PaperworkReduction Act. The Agency has requested OMB clearance by June 14, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: June 6, 1989.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Paul Lapsley,  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director, Information and Regulatory Systems Division.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Letter to Manufacturers of Aqueous Cleaners   </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Dear:The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is developing additionalbackground information on aqueous cleaners for use in possible furtherregulation of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)-based solvents under section 157(b)of the Clean Air Act (CAA). That section authorizes EPA to regulate, asneeded, to protect stratospheric ozone, taking into account the feasibilityand cost of such regulation. Fully halogenated CFCs, like CFC-113, havebeen found to endanger stratospheric ozone, and EPA has promulgated limitson future production and consumption of these CFCs. (<T3>See </T3>53 FR 30566 notice). The Agency is still considering the needto target certain uses of CFCs, including the use of CFC-113 as a solvent,for further regulation. (<T3>See </T3>53 FR 30604). In this context, EPA needs information on likelysubstitutes for CFC-113, so that it may assess the cost and feasibilityof further regulating that substance. As the Agency noted in the ANPRM,aqueous and terpene cleaners are likely to replace up to 50% of the CFC-113currently used in electronics precision and metal cleaning. EPA is thereforerequesting that producers of aqueous cleaners provide the information specifiedin the enclosure.  The Agency requests this information under Section 114 of the CAA, whichgives EPA authority to secure information, even confidential business information,needed to carry out the provisions of the Act, including section 157(b).You may assert a claim of business confidentiality for any of the informationwhich you submit by clearly marking that information as ``confidential''.Such information will be treated in accordance with the EPA's proceduresfor handling information claimed as confidential under 40 CFR Part 2, SubpartB, and will only be disclosed if EPA determines that the information isnot entitled to confidential treatment. Procedures to be used for makingconfidentiality determinations, substantive criteria to be used in suchdeterminations, and special rules governing information obtained underSection 114 are set forth in 40 CFR Part 2. You must assert any claim ofconfidentiality at the time you submit this information. If no claim ofconfidentiality accompanies the information when it is received by EPA,it may be made available to the public by EPA without further notice toyou (40 CFR 2.203).  EPA intends to utilize the services of ICF Incorporated, under contractnumber 68-02-460, to provide technical assistance and support for EPA'sevaluation of the data requested here. This contractor will be designedas the authorized representative of the Agency and will be provided theinformation submitted in response to this request, including any informationclaimed to be confidential. Disclosure of this information to the contractoris necessary for the performance of this contract. As the authorized representative,this contractor will be subject to the provisions of 40 CFR 2.301 (h).You may include in your submission any comments concerning such disclosureof confidential business information to ICF Incorporated. No disclosureof confidential information will be made sooner than 10 days after yourreceipt of this notice.  I would appreciate your providing a response to this letter no later thanJuly 15, 1989. If you have specific questions on the information that isrequired under this request please call Karla Perri, Senior Policy Analysts,Division of Global Change, at (202) 475-7496.

Currently, the Montreal Protocoland the EPA regulation require a 50 percent phased-in reduction in theproduction and consumption of specified fully-halogenated CFCs by 1998,and a freeze at 1986 levels of specified halons beginning in 1992. On March3, 1989, however, President Bush announced that the United States wouldsupport a 100% phase-out of all fully-halogenated CFCs and halons by theyear 2000, providing safe substitutes are available. This announcementmakes imperative the need to find a replacement for all of the fully-halogenatedCFCs and halons sooner then these rules indicate.In the ANPRM EPA stated that it expects 50 percent of the CFC-113 currentlyused for electronics and metal cleaning to be replaced with aqueous andterpene solutions. EPA wants to evaluate the human health or environmentalrisks that these alternative solutions may pose. Therefore, the Agencyis requesting confidential business data for every aqueous cleaner youproduce, which can replace CFC-113 and any other chlorinated solvent usedfor electronics, precision, and general metal cleaning uses.EPA is under extremely short deadlines in trying to addresss these humanhealth and environmental concerns. The Agency appreciates that you haveother priorities. Nevertheless, the EPA asks that you comply with the deadlineof June 15, 1989, as requested in this letter.
