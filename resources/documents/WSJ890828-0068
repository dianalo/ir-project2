And it will get there the old-fashioned way: Investors hunting for values.    The industrial average smashed through its pre-crash high last Thursday to a record 2734.64. The average eased back a bit in profit-taking Friday, and there's no lack of skeptics who think the market is headed for substantial declines.    Undeterred, the bulls predict further gains in the months ahead as investors sniff out unrealized potential. One aspect of this strategy is the takeover, and these analysts don't discount the possibility that one or more of the 30 blue chips in the Dow industrials might become a target.    Though the market has been generally recovering since the October 1987 crash, the rally that eventually carried the Dow to unprecedented heights began Nov. 16, 1988. Since then, stocks considered to be &quot;defensive&quot; issues against a slowing or declining economy have outperformed the market. Fearing a possible recession, investors have moved into such Dow stocks as Coca-Cola Co., Procter andamp; Gamble, Philip Morris and Merck, all of which in past downturns have managed to maintain earnings momentum.    But the leadership for the Dow's next 300-point climb will most likely be in the cyclical stocks -- those belonging to companies whose profits wax when the economy grows and wane when it shrinks -- says Michael Metz, market strategist for Oppenheimer andamp; Co.    &quot;They are heavily weighted in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and they are the real bargains,&quot; Mr. Metz declares. Such Dow industrials stocks as Alcoa, Du Pont, International Paper and, to some extent, United Technologies and Allied-Signal are viewed as cyclical stocks.    Investors stampeded out of these and similar stocks earlier this year as the recession alarms rang. As a result, these stocks trail the market in both price performance alone and in ratio of their prices to annual per-share earnings, a basic standard for many value-oriented money managers.    Mr. Metz also expects many of the Dow's high-profile stocks, such as Coca-Cola, to maintain their current performance. So, he says, the Dow industrials soon will begin to outperform such broader market barometers as Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index. In the race to climb back to pre-crash highs, by contrast, the Sandamp;P 500 and several other broad indexes beat the Dow by several weeks.    Not even the most starry-eyed optimists foresee a straight-up move without corrections. William Raftery, technical analyst for Smith Barney, says temporary sell-offs are typical when investors switch from one sector of stocks to another. But he, too, thinks investors must move into cyclical issues if the market is to move significantly higher.    &quot;If we are going to 3000 or even higher it will be with Alcoa, Deere, and Du Pont rather than Kellogg,&quot; Mr. Raftery says.    The essence of the bulls' analysis is that over the past several years of restructuring, America's basic industries have added to their production capacity and upgraded their equipment. Now those moves are beginning to pay off in higher profits, and many of the companies are building up their stores of cash because their big capital purchases are behind them.    All of which is good news for investors. Higher profits usually result in fatter dividends and climbing stock prices. And because some of these companies will use cash to buy back their own stock, their share prices will get an extra boost. Also, strong cash flow and assets that aren't fully valued in share prices are the chief characteristics of takeover candidates.    &quot;With their high cash flows and under-leveraged balance sheets, a buy-out of one of the Dow stocks is quite within reason,&quot; says Mr. Metz of Oppenheimer.    Here are how bullish analysts are looking at some of the lagging cyclical stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average:    --Allied-Signal is selling at a P/E ratio of about 10, compared with 13 for all 500 stocks in the Sandamp;P index. This maker of aerospace and automotive parts and chemicals has about 35% of its capital as debt, which is low when compared with many companies that have restructured.    The company should earn about $3.50 a share this year and about $3.80 in 1990, predicts Eli Lustgarten, first vice president at PaineWebber. Allied-Signal's stake in Union Texas Petroleum is at about the value the company would like to sell it for -- close to $1.1 billion. After taxes, that would give the company about $900 million to buy back stock or redeem debt.    Allied-Signal should also start to build a significant amount of cash in 1990 after it completes some special payments for a federally mandated pollution cleanup project, Mr. Lustgarten says.    --United Technologies is slightly undervalued to the market, says Phillip Brannon, Merrill Lynch first vice president. United is less cyclical than some of its counterparts in the Dow average. The company has some interests in the automotive industry, but its main businesses are spare parts for elevators and jet engines.    About 33% of the company's capital is debt. Mr. Brannon expects the company to at least match last year's per-share earnings of $5.05 this year, and perhaps pull ahead to $5.20. United's aerospace interests -- Sikorsky helicopters and a subsidiary that produces aircraft parts -- may be attractive spinoff assets if the company is targeted for takeover, or in defense against a buy-out. But Mr. Brannon says he is &quot;on the fence&quot; about the company's takeover candidacy, because the Pentagon might oppose such an acquisition of a defense contractor.    --International Paper stock is trading at a P/E ratio of about 8. Cash is flowing into the company at a strong rate, and it is buying back its shares, says George Adler, managing director at Smith Barney. Earnings should rise to about $7.45 a share this year from $6.57 last year, Mr. Adler estimates.    Though the company has fallen into favor with many money mangers because of its low P/E ratio, Mr. Adler recommends that investors hold up for the time being in buying the stock. Current profit margins probably aren't sustainable, Mr. Adler says. But IP has one feature that is undoubtedly of interest to takeover strategists: acres upon acres of undervalued timber land.    ---@ Market Sector Performance @ Percentage change in price for the eight sectors of the Dow Jones Equity Market Index from Nov. 16, 1988 through Aug. 24, and for the stocks of the Dow Jones Industrial Average that are included in each sector. @ % CHANGE @ FROM 11/16/88 @ SECTOR/COMPANY TO 8/24/89 @ Consumer, Non-cyclical 44.90% @ Coca-Cola 64.65 @ Merck 40.09 @ Philip Morris 74.73 @ Procter andamp; Gamble 65.30 @ Consumer, Cyclical 38.04 @ Eastman Kodak 15.71 @ General Motors 17.98 @ Goodyear 8.97 @ McDonald's 31.30 @ Sears Roebuck 13.75 @ Woolworth 33.83 @ Conglomerates 35.73 @ General Electric 36.76 @ Financial 35.38 @ American Express 42.38 @ Primerica 29.17 @ Basic Materials 32.33 @ Alcoa 49.02 @ Bethlehem Steel 4.22 @ Du Pont 50.63 @ International Paper 32.65 @ Union Carbide 14.85 @ Industrial 29.26 @ Allied-Signal 21.24 @ Navistar 2.56 @ Westinghouse 40.05 @ Energy 28.86 @ Chevron 28.24 @ Exxon 7.93 @ Texaco 18.36 @ USX Corp. 32.38 @ Technology 19.74 @ ATandamp;T 45.25 @ Boeing 36.14 @ IBM 0.43 @ Minnesota Mining 34.74 @ United Technologies 45.93 @ Dow Jones Equity Market Index 32.86 @ Dow Jones Industrial Average 34.14 @ Note: Data adjusted for stock splits but not for dividends @ Source: IDD Information Services/Tradeline    ---   Friday's Market Activity    Thursday's record-breaking close gave way to profit-taking Friday, and stocks finished at a slight loss.    Solid gains among many of the blue chips held the Dow Jones Industrial Average's loss to 2.28 to close at 2732.36.    Some 165,930,000 shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, down sharply from Thursday's 225,520,000.    The Dow industrials fared much better than broader measures. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index dropped 1 -- the equivalent of a 7 1/2-point loss in the Dow industrials -- to finish the week at 350.52. The Dow Jones Equity Market Index went down 0.68 to 329.05 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index fell 0.50 to 194.79.    The Dow industrials easily ran its string of consecutive weekly gains to eight by rising 44.39 points, or 1.7%. The Sandamp;P 500 and the Dow equity index both added 1.3% during the week, while the New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.1%    Actively traded blue-chip issues showing strength included General Motors, which went up 1 1/8 to 47 7/8 on Big Board composite volume of 2.5 million shares; General Electric, up 1/2 to 58 5/8 on 1.5 million shares, and Union Carbide, 3/8 higher to 29 3/8 on 2.2 million shares. Other standout advancers among blue chips included Philip Morris, which gained 2 1/8 to 161 1/8, and Woolworth, which rose 1 3/8 to 68 5/8.    UAL jumped 10 to 278 as investor Marvin Davis provided details of the financing for his $275-a-share takeover offer. Mr. Davis has announced a plan to borrow $7 billion in bank financing from two units of Citicorp; in addition, a Davis family partnership will provide $1 billion of equity.    Other airline issues rallied along with UAL, the owner of United Airlines; the gains resulted in another all-time high for the Dow Jones Transportation Average, which rose 19.20 to 1467.99. AMR, which owns American Airlines, jumped 1 7/8 to 79 1/8; Delta Air Lines added 1 to 77 3/4, and Southwest Airlines gained 5/8 to 26 3/8.    BankAmerica went up 7/8 to 32 1/2 on 2.4 million shares. Dean Witter Reynolds repeated its buy recommendation on the stock and said it expects the company to increase the dividend by as much as 50% in January.    Phillips Petroleum climbed 1 3/8 to 29 1/2 in the third consecutive day of heavy trading, fueled by ongoing takeover speculation. The stock was also the New York Stock Exchange's most active, with nearly three million shares changing hands.    Speculative buying spread to other oil issues as well: Unocal rose 1 7/8 to 52 1/2, Kerr-McGee advanced 1 1/8 to 49 1/2, Louisiana Land andamp; Exploration rose 3/4 to 42 and Tosco gained 1 5/8 to 21 3/8.    Several stocks that had rallied earlier last week on takeover-related buying were among the market's losers. Maytag fell 1 1/4 to 25 1/4 on 2.1 million shares, Holiday retreated 1 1/2 to 81 1/2 and International Minerals andamp; Chemical tumbled 2 3/8 to 52 5/8.    Campbell Soup plunged 3 1/4 to 50 1/4 as its restructuring plans, calling for the closing of four U.S. plants and the elimination of about 2,800 jobs, cooled speculation about a possible offer for the company.    Marion Laboratories fell 1 1/8 to 34 5/8 after Dow Chemical completed its $38-a-share tender offer, the first phase of a two-part transaction in which Marion will merge with Dow's pharmaceutical unit.    Tiffany jumped 5 to 59. In an appearance on Cable News Network, financial reporter Dan Dorfman said the company's stock may be under accumulation by a potential suitor and mentioned an estimated takeover price of $80 a share, or about $700 million. Tiffany said it has received no takeover bid.    Motel 6 rose 5/8 to 15 7/8. Michael G. Mueller, an analyst at Montgomery Securities, told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report the partnership could be sold for as much as $30 a unit, based on the price Holiday obtained for its Holiday Inn chain.    Federal-Mogul jumped 2 3/4 to 26. Nortek received federal clearance to acquire more than $15 million of its common shares. Separately, the company completed a joint-venture agreement with G. Bruss G.m.b.H. andamp; Co., a West German firm.    Amax dropped 3/4 to 28 3/4. Falconbridge withdrew its recommendation of the company's takeover proposal and endorsed a rival offer for Falconbridge, made jointly by Noranda Inc. and Trelleborg AB.    Spain Fund went down 7/8 to 17 3/8. The Wall Street Journal reported that even bullish analysts and money managers are puzzled that the mutual fund has been trading at a premium of more than 33% to its net asset value.    OHM gained 3/4 to 13 3/4. The company said its O.H. Materials unit was awarded a five-year federal contract, worth as much as $50 million, to clean up hazardous waste sites.    The American Stock Exchange Index dropped 0.27 to 381.18, reducing its gain for the week to 0.5%.    Texas Air, by far the most active issue on the Amex, advanced 7/8 to 20 3/4 on 2.1 million shares. Chairman Frank Lorenzo said the company may consider selling a minority or controlling stake in its Continental Airlines unit. </TEXT></DOC>
