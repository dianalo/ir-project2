Today, Jesse Jackson is saying government is the answer -- lots of government.    The Jackson platform includes a long list of new government programs, including national health insurance, a doubling of the education budget and a variety of other economic, social, environmental and energy programs. His issue papers include nearly every major new federal program proposed over the past 20 years, from a &quot;national child care office&quot; to a domestic version of the World Bank. The total cost could easily run to $100 billion a year or more.    And that isn't all. The Rev. Jackson's campaign literature also suggests he has plans for a vast expansion of government regulation of the economy. He would not only roll back the &quot;deregulation&quot; trend that began under President Jimmy Carter but also impose an array of new regulations on corporations. Among other things, he says he would &quot;elaborate a code of conduct for American business.&quot;    Such sweeping federal activism might have been popular among voters two decades ago, but it isn't at all clear that even Democratic voters are willing to support it now.    &quot;There has been a major shift in attitude over the last two years toward a more activist government role,&quot; Democratic pollster Paul Maslin says. &quot;But this still isn't the halcyon days of the New Deal or the 1960s.&quot;    In a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll this year, voters were asked which they think is &quot;more of a threat to the nation's economy -- big government or big business.&quot; A majority -- 54% -- chose big government as the larger evil; even among Democratic voters, 47% said big government.    Jackson supporters argue that each of the proposed programs is justified.    &quot;We weren't just hunting for things to do,&quot; says issues adviser Mark Steitz. &quot;These are urgent national needs.&quot;    Jackson adviser Ann Lewis says: &quot;People don't think of the government as an abstraction. If you look at the programs individually, then I think there is strong support.&quot;    Mr. Jackson also has done more than the other presidential candidates to spell out how he would pay for this largesse. He proposes a tax increase of $40 billion a year for corporations and the wealthy, cuts of $60 billion a year in defense spending and other measures that could raise a further $20 billion or more a year.    The most expensive item on Mr. Jackson's list is a program of &quot;universal and comprehensive health care&quot; that guarantees &quot;cradle-to-grave protection.&quot; He foresees extending the Medicare program for the elderly to &quot;all U.S. citizens and residents&quot; and expanding it to provide not only basic care but also long-term health care, care for catastrophic illnesses and a variety of other services.    Reagan administration estimates are that long-term health care alone could cost $20 billion to $30 billion a year by early in the next century. The price of the broader health program envisioned by Mr. Jackson could easily soar above $50 billion a year.    Mr. Jackson has advocated doubling the nation's education budget, now at $20 billion, and increasing the funding for a variety of special programs including bilingual education. He also calls for a domestic version of the World Bank to finance development projects in the U.S. And he calls for a government program that would channel billions of dollars from public pension funds into low-income housing, neighborhood revitalization and investments in infrastructure.    Although the government would only have to pay for projects that go sour, the program still would divert $60 billion from private investment.    The Rev. Jackson also has proposed a comprehensive national child care policy, with increased funding and tax credits. He supports significantly increased funding for the Supplemental Security Income program, public transportation and national parks. And he would institute new or expanded programs for family security, family counseling, help for teen-age parents, adult education and literacy.    The Jackson plan also includes new programs to address drug and alcohol abuse, sexual responsibility and school drop-out prevention. He favors a comprehensive national nutrition and hunger policy, including increased food stamps and nutritional education.    On energy issues, Mr. Jackson calls for a major federal investment in renewable energy from solar, water, wind and agricultural sources and a major federal program to rebuild and insulate homes. He calls for a massive federally funded program to combat acquired immune deficiency syndrome and a &quot;Marshall Plan&quot; development program for the Third World.    But the reach of the Jackson plan goes beyond these direct government programs to include a vast new regulatory regime.    Mr. Jackson would support a federal initiative establishing the principle of pay equity, would require manufacturers to change their &quot;production processes&quot; to reduce pollution, wants to eliminate unsafe toxic-waste dumps, would cut the use of pesticides and would increase aid for recycling programs. He also has stated his opposition to the deregulation of airlines and banks.    On regulatory issues, Mr. Jackson may find support among voters for specific programs. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll in March, for instance, found that 61% of the respondents favored more government regulation of the environment and 50% favored more regulation of on-the-job health and safety.    But when asked whether they thought there is too much, not enough or just about the right amount of government regulation of the economy, a plurality -- 38% -- said &quot;too much.&quot;    Jackson campaign officials insist that their program is economically sound. Asked whether it is politically feasible, Mr. Steitz, the issues adviser, responds: &quot;That's what elections are for.&quot;    (See related story: &quot;...And His Call for Activist Uncle Sam Appears to Be Selling Well on the Stump&quot; -- WSJ April 8, 1988)   ---         How Jackson Would Pay For His New Programs    Raise personal tax rate to    38.5% for top income                 $20 million    Raise corporate tax rate             $20 million    Cut defense spending                 $60 billion    Tax to discourage mergers    and speculation                      $10 billion    Additional loophole closings         $10 billion    Total available for deficit-    reduction and new programs           $120 billion</TEXT></DOC>
