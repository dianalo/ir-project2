He was referring to the Emirates' announcement it was increasingits crude production to 1.5 million barrels a day from its OPEC-setquota of 948,000 barrels.   Santos said the announcement had a ``devastating effect'' on theworld oil market.   ``The commitment to a production ceiling is based on theunderstanding that all the countries must respect it. If a countrydoes not respect its quota, the other 12 member countries willconsider themselves free to produce as much as they considernecessary,'' he said.   Ecuador and the United Arab Emirates are among OPEC's 13 membernations.   Santos said the average price of Ecuador's oil has dropped from$14.19 a barrel since June 1 to $12.83 a barrel on June 29.   With an average daily production of 300,000 barrels, Ecuador isone of the smallest producers in OPEC. But oil exports supply morethan 60 percent of the country's dollar earnings.   The government had based this year's budget on an expected priceof $17 a barrel, Santos said.   In Manama, Bahrain, it was reported Monday that the biggest oilproducer in the Emirates, Abu Dhabi, has posted low prices for Juneretroactive crude oil sales without indicating any substantial cutsin July.   The reported action by the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. promptedspeculation that the Emirates was unlikely to overshoot itsproduction quota as fixed by OPEC, at least in the short term.   Oil industry executives said the company, in telexes sent to itsterm-contract customers, set prices for its June delivery atbetween $1.10 and $1.13 lower than May's retroactive levels.   The state-owned oil refining and marketing company moved toretroactive crude-oil pricing in March after world oil pricessubstantially weakened and the company was unable to maintainofficial prices decreed by OPEC.   The sources, who cannot be identified under standing rules, saidthat since there was no indication of any pricing policy change inthe telex it could mean the company meant to market sufficientvolumes of crude oil this month to substantially boost oil outputas recently threatened by Emirates officials.   Emirates Oil Minister Mana Said al Oteiba said his country wasrightfully entitled to 1.5 million barrels a day, instead of theOPEC quota.   Abu Dhabi is the major oil producer among the seven emiratesfederated in the United Arab Emirates, whose central governmentlater supported Oteiba's statements.   But it has remained unclear whether the Emirates planned toincrease production at once or were only jockeying for positionmonths ahead of the December biannual meeting of OPEC, whereproduction levels will come up for consideration.   Officials in Abu Dhabi oil companies, who spoke on conditionthey not be identified, challenged reports that the Emirates willincrease their output in the near future in the face of theEmirates' standing demand for a higher OPEC quota.   ``It is the huge surplus in the market and the vast oil reservesin Japan, the UAE's major oil importer, which determines the sizeof UAE's production and not adherence to OPEC's quota,'' oneofficial told The Associated Press.   Denying reports that orders were given by the Abu Dhabigovernment to increase the companies' July output, the source said:``We have not received any order to this effect. The Abu Dhabigovernment realizes that it cannot market any oil quantity over itspresent quota with a reasonable price.''   The sources said Japan was pressing for discounts, both in theUnited Arab Emirates as well as in other Persian Gulf oil-producingstates. Japan depends for more than 60 percent of its oil needs onthe gulf.</TEXT></DOC>
