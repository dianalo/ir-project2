Trading in petroleum-futures contracts on the New YorkMercantile Exchange was very light yesterday as traderscontinued to hold tight, waiting for news out of the OPECgathering. When the trading day was over, July crude oil wasunchanged at $21.13 a barrel, and gasoline and heating oilfor July were slightly lower.   Meanwhile, the Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil ministers, both newat their jobs, conceded that their countries' abilities toproduce remain sharply curtailed -- by United Nation'ssanctions against Iraq and by the severe damages inflicted onKuwait's oil wells by departing Iraqi troops when the PersianGulf War ended in February. Still, both insisted separatelythat they expect the 11 other exporting nations to make roomfor them -- to the full extent of their OPEC quotas -- assoon as they are able to export in significant amounts.   &quot;Our quota is 1.5 million barrels a day, and we aresticking to it,&quot; Homoud Al-Rqobah, Kuwait's oil minister,said. &quot;It's our share.&quot;   Kuwait isn't producing at all at the moment. But,according to its minister, it should be able to resumeproduction within weeks, if not days, despite itsstill-burning wells. &quot;Soon we will be producing the first50,000 barrels a day -- this month or next,&quot; he said.   Iraq is already producing much more than that, its oilminister said. &quot;We are going up very fast,&quot; he said.   The Iraqi minister, Osama Abdul Razzak Al-Hiti, citedcurrent production of 450,000 to 500,000 barrels a day. Thatis enough, he said, for domestic consumption and for exportsof 55,000 barrels a day of crude to Jordan, allowed undersanctions. And he said Iraq could produce more than onemillion barrels a day in &quot;a short time&quot; after the U.N. banagainst its oil is lifted.   Mr. Al-Hiti denied that Iraq will seek a new OPECproduction allotment at this time. &quot;We don't need to,&quot; hesaid. &quot;We have the quota already.&quot;   Asked when Iraq expects to reach its old quota of 3.1million barrels a day, Mr. Al-Hiti replied: &quot;We will be inthat area next year.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
