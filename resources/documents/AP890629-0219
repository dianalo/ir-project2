The government also denounced the European Economic Community forcondemning the attack on the student-led movement.   Government-run newspapers on Friday continued quoting leaders'criticism that foreign lands were trying to isolate China in thename of human rights.   The China Daily quoted President Yang Shangkun as telling adelegation from Bolivia Thursday he hoped the world ``willunderstand that the suppression of the rebellion represents areasonable act in handlng our internal affairs.''   The steering committee of China's legislature held a specialmeeting to endorse the Communist Party's suppression of dissent as``legal, correct and necessary.''   Li said many nations had shown understanding for China's toughstance.   ``At the same time, China has also noticed an anti-China adversecurrent. Under the banner of human rights, these people have madeunwarranted accusations of China for its quelling of thecounterrevolutionary rebellion and punishment of criminals accordingto law.''   The official Xinhua News Agency said Li made the comments in ameeting with Foreign Minister Carlos Da Graca of Sao Tome andPrincipe, a tiny island nation off the west coast of Africa.   ``Your visit is a support for China,'' Li told Da Graca, thehighest-level foreign dignitary to visit China since soldiersmarched on Beijing the night of June 3-4 and crushed the movementfor a freer society.   The troops, backed by tanks, fired on unarmed civilians and drovethousands of protesters from Tiananmen Square. The government says200 to 300 people, most of them soldiers, were killed in theconfrontation. Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence reportssay that most of the dead were civilians and that the toll was ashigh as 3,000.   Authorities since have arrested more than 1,800 people andexecuted 27, and China has become increasingly isolated from theinternational community.   The 12-nation EEC on Tuesday condemned the ``brutal repressiontaking place in China'' and called for an embargo on arms sales. Italso urged the World Bank to postpone new loans to Beijing.   The United States, Canada, Japan and Australia have taken similarsteps.   Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Li Jinhua said the EEC had made``presumptuous accusations against China and unilaterally adopteddecisions jeopardizing the bilateral relations.''   ``The Chinese government cannot but express deep regret over thisunreasonable act of the European Council,'' she said.   Wan Li, chairman of the Standing Committee of the NationalPeople's Congress, opened the committee meeting by praising theparty and government for taking ``resolute measures to quell thecounterrevolutionary rebellion.''   ``This decision was in line with the fundamental interests ofpeople of all nationalities in China, and thus was legal, correctand necessary,'' Xinhua quoted him as telling the 133 memberspresent.   The full congress has about 3,000 members and meets once a year.It has limited powers and mainly serves as a forum for endorsingparty policy.   The committee meeting was part of a nationwide campaign to unifyChina's 1.1 billion people behind the crackdown on the seven-weekpro-democracy movement.   The committee canceled a June 20 session, at which it had plannedto discuss political reforms demanded by students. The demands,including a freer press, were replaced on Thursday's agenda with aproposal to tighten control over people's rights to stage ralliesand demonstrations.   ``Stability represents China's highest interest,'' said Wan, onceconsidered a moderate.   The Communist Party last week dismissed party chief Zhao Ziyang,also considered a moderate, because he had expressed sympathy forthe student protesters demands.   The party replaced him with Shanghai party boss Jiang Zemin, whoin his first public statement Wednesday called for ``severepunishments'' for leaders of the movement.   Jiang and other newly appointed hard-line members of thePolitburo Standing Committee, the party's top decision-making body,appeared Thursday with hundreds of military officers to celebratethe 68th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party, which isSaturday.   Jiang, standing next to Premier Li, sang patriotic songs with theofficers.</TEXT></DOC>
