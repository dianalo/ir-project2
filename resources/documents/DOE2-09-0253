In a time of increasing surplus crop reserves, dwindlingfuel resources, widening foreign trade deficits, and record unemployment,the federal government established a new and progressive program, theAlcohol Fuels Program. The program was intended to create a renewablefuel source, reduce foreign trade deficits, stabilize the agriculturalmarket, provide a more environmentally acceptable fuel source, createnew jobs, and reduce American dependence on foreign oil. The New EnergyCompany of Indiana was formed to play an important role in this new ethanolindustry. New Energy Company of Indiana operates a new 60-million-gallons-per-yeargrassroots production facility in South Bend, Indiana. Design of thisfacility has incorporated some of the latest technological innovationsto ensure efficient and reliable production. The New Energy plant processesmore than 22 million bushels of corn per year to produce alcohol, carbondioxide, and animal feed. The facility has brought over 1,000 new jobsto the state and added needed dollars to the local tax base. The futureof this new industry, and the rewards to be realized by the Americanpeople, are dependent upon facilities such as the one operated by theNew Energy Company.</TEXT></DOC>
