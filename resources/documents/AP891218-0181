The move came as President Carlos Menem struggles to carry out atricky program of privatization of state-run businesses,deregulation and reduced government spending to remedy decade-longinflation and related economic problems.   When banks reopen after a government-ordered banking holidaythat began Friday, the value of the austral, the beleaguerednational currency, will be determined by market forces, new EconomyMinister Antonio Erman Gonzalez said.   Most prices will also be set in the marketplace.   However, the holiday will continue at least through Tuesday,said the spokesman for the Economy Ministry, Miguel Alurralde.   Erman Gonzalez announced the new measures Monday in a 10-minutespeech that followed his swearing-in to replace Nestor Rapanelli.Rapanelli resigned Friday after a plunge in the value of theaustral on the black market.   The importance of the measures was underlined by the fact thatthe speech was broadcast nationwide from Government House. Inattendance were the president, vice president, Cabinet ministers,business and union leaders, and top brass of the armed forces.   In his own short speech, Menem insisted his economic programwould continue. He said it is the only hope for remedying thecountry's economic problems.   ``On this flight, we are all on board, absolutely everyone, andthis plane has no parachutes,'' Menem said. ``Anyone who wants tojump may jump, knowing the consequences.''   Erman Gonzalez, the third economy minister in Menem's5-month-old government, takes over amid economic distress thatthreatens to become a political crisis for Menem.   The president risks losing public support he needs in the shortrun until his reforms produce long-term benefits. A wide segment oforganized labor, a powerful force in Argentina, and business haveattacked his plans.   Even Menem's own labor-based Peronist Party has shown onlylukewarm support for the reforms.   Inflation that moderated to 6.5 percent in November from 197percent in July is projected to top 30 percent in December.   One of the causes of economic deterioration the past week wasmassive buying of dollars. Analysts said the buying was triggeredby the government's unexpected decision to suspend repayment ofprincipal on internal bonds for two years and raise taxes onexports.   Erman Gonzalez instead annulled the unpopular tax hikes and saidthe government would try to repay the principal on time.   While price controls for food and many consumer and industrialproducts will be lifted, Erman Gonzalez said the government willcontinue to regulate rates for gas, electricity, water, telephones,bus and commuter train fares, and other public services.   To help Argentines pay for the rates, Erman Gonzalez authorizeda monthly pay increase for public and private workers of about $20.   Lifting controls on the austral means exporters may converttheir dollars at the Central Bank at a much higher rate. The moveis intended to induce them to turn in dollars it has been hoardingfrom overseas sales of beef and grain.   The Central Bank has previously been regulating the exchangemarket.</TEXT></DOC>
