They are right. In the 1964 presidential election, nearly 70% of those eligible said they voted, according to the Census Bureau. But by 1984 that figure had slipped to 60%.    Barring the nomination of some truly uninspiring candidates, however, voter turnout should rise for at least the next four presidential elections. That's because younger people, who don't vote nearly as often as middle-aged or older people, will be a smaller proportion of eligible voters.    The number of potential voters under age 35, less than half of whom vote, peaked in 1984 at 40% of the electorate and is projected to be only about 30% of potential voters by the year 2000. By contrast, the number of people age 45 to 64 -- nearly three-quarters of whom voted in 1984 -- is growing fast. The Census Bureau projects that group to grow 34% in the next 12 years, an increase of 15 million people.    Women Outnumber   Men at the Polls   ONE MAJOR change in the voting booth has been the shift in turnouts among men and women. In the 1964 election (and probably in all previous elections), more men than women voted: 72% of eligible men vs. 67% of eligible women. By 1984, however, 61% of women voted, compared with 59% of men.    Changes in population mean that women will probably continue to outnumber men at the polls. This fall, the U.S. will have a record 183 million potential voters, 95 million women and 87 million men. According to the Census Bureau, the biggest increase will be among voters 25 to 44 years old, who will make up nearly half of the electorate. Increases are also projected for voters 45 to 64, and 65 and older. But the number of young voters -- age 18 to 24 -- is expected to decline.    These trends favor women, since female voters are more numerous among middle-aged and older voters. For example, among people 65 and older, two-thirds of whom vote, six out of every 10 potential voters are projected to be women.    In November, then, there could be between six million and seven million more votes cast by women than men. Considering how close the 1986 senatorial races were, that difference out of a projected 100 million votes could swing the election.    Fewer People Move   From State to State   AMERICANS may like to think of themselves as a restless people, but more individuals appear to be content with -- or resigned to -- the place where they're living.    Between 1980 and 1985, according to Census Bureau statistics, 8.7% of surveyed adults moved to a different state. That's down from 9.1% in 1975-80 and 9.3% in 1970-75.    The surveys found large differences in interstate mobility when respondents were divided into age groups. Between 1980 and 1985, for example, about one out of every six people age 25 to 29 (16%) had moved to a different state, but only one out of every 18 people age 45 to 54 (6%) had done so. The lowest mobility was among people 65 and older. A mere 3.3% of them -- only one out of every 30 -- moved to another state between 1980 and 1985.    The same trends are apparent when all moves -- between states and within states -- are considered. Nearly three-quarters of the population age 45 to 54 were at the same residence in 1985 as they were in 1980, vs. only about onequarter of people age 25 to 29.    Strong Housing Sales   Linked to Baby Boomers   AS THE NUMBER of people age 25 to 29 shrinks in size over the next 12 years (down 21%) and the number of people age 45 to 54 increases (up 55%), one set of business people may be quite unhappy with families' decisions to stay where they are: real-estate agents.    The cream of the U.S. housing market is the single-family dwelling in the suburbs that is sold mostly to married couples. The National Association of Realtors estimates that about 3.5 million such homes were sold in 1987 for a total of $371 billion.    Housing sales in the short term are sensitive to factors like interest rates, consumer confidence and the stock market. But in the long term, selling an existing home means having a family move. In future years that may be a less-frequent occurrence.    Most of the baby-boom generation is still in its late 20s and 30s. But as its members move into their 40s, according to one scenario, they will settle down and buy a house to live in for a relatively long time. If so, turnover would be reduced, and it would be harder to find buyers for those homes that do go on the market.    Working against this scenario is the fact that many baby-boom couples have no children. The absence of children, particularly school-age ones, makes it easier for couples to move, thus increasing turnover and ultimately home sales. </TEXT></DOC>
