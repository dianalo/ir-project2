In theUSA, there are fifty three examples on carbon dioxide miscible floodingand thirty one examples on carbon dioxide immiscible flooding. The enhancedrates of oil recovery by carbon dioxide miscible flooding are 7 to 13%. In Hungary, the oil reservior pressures were increased rapidly dueto the carbon dioxide injection and the push by water, and the recoveryrates of 24 % and more were achieved. In Turkey, carbon dioxide immiscibleflooding is in a trial stage. In these countries, carbon dioxide canbe provided comparatively easily owing to the existences of the carbondioxide fields, and the advantageous conditions are utilized. In Japan,the pilot tests are carried out with main research subjects on the phasebehavior of carbon dioxide-oil system, prospect for performance of carbondioxide miscible flooding by oil reservior simulation.
