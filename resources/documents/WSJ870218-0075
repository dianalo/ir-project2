The leveraged buyout is contingent on Becor Western selling its Western Gear Corp. aerospace unit to Lucas Industries PLC of England for about $117 million. The management group, which also includes Broad Street Investment Fund I L.P., will pay Western Gear's debt of about $15 million. The adviser for the management group is Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., which is also a general partner of Broad Street.    Once that sale is completed, South Milwaukee, Wis.-based Becor Western's main business will be the manufacture of mining machinery, which was profitable last year, according to the company's chairman and chief executive officer, Norris K. Ekstrom.    Demand for mining machinery is expected to be about flat this year, but analysts say Becor Western can be profitable in the business because of parts demand and because of continued cost-cutting at the company. Goldman Sachs vice president Mikael Salovaara said the newly formed private company has no plans to diversify.    &quot;It's a cyclical business. The idea is to get hunkered down until demand for new machines comes back,&quot; says John Mackin, an analyst with Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.    Mr. Ekstrom said the company was selling Western Gear, which he said had a loss in 1986, because of a move in the industry to buy aerospace systems rather than just parts. He added that the investment necessary to keep the unit competitive was prohibitive.    Birmingham, England-based Lucas Industries, which is buying Western Gear, makes aerospace, automotive and industrial products.    In 1986, Becor Western had a net loss of $13.1 million, compared with net income of $3.1 million in 1985. The recent year's results include a charge of $22.1 million, which was partially offset by gains totalling $14.9 million. Last year's profit included a $4.1 million gain.    The leveraged-buyout offer is being led by Becor Western's president, William B. Winter, and other senior executives of the company. Management will own a majority of the newly formed company. Mr. Ekstrom isn't involved in the buyout. He said he had personal plans, but wouldn't elaborate.    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company largely with debt that ultimately is paid with funds generated by the acquired company.    The management group plans to buy each of Becor Western's 16.5 million common shares for $10.45 in cash and $4 face amount of senior sinking fund debentures. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Becor Western closed at $14, up 87.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
