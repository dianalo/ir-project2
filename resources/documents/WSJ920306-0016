Immune Response's president had indicated last June thatclinical trials of uninfected patients using the company'sHIV vaccine would begin by the end of 1991.</LP><TEXT>   And Immune Response has long maintained that a vaccine,based on an approach first suggested by polio pioneer andImmune Response founder Jonas Salk of using whole butinactivated AIDS viruses to inoculate people against thedreaded disease is completely safe. The company hashighlighted its safe completion of testing of the vaccine onhumans already infected with the AIDS virus.   But many in the medical community have long disagreed.Some believe that a glitch in quality control in theproduction of the vaccine or other factors make it too riskyfor a mass-prevention strategy. As a parallel, they oftennote that the polio vaccine has at times given people thepolio disease.   Where other researchers use genetically engineered orsynthetic virus proteins, Dr. Salk has chosen to use livevirus killed with gamma radiation.   A spokesman for the company said that &quot;we intend to do thestudy,&quot; on uninfected individuals but that some &quot;logisticalissues&quot; involving product liability have to be worked outfirst and have dragged on longer than expected. It's unclearwhen the company will press forward with the study, whichwould launch clinical trials of the company's HIV vaccine on10 to 15 uninfected patients in California. That cadre ofpatients would include Dr. Salk.   &quot;This is an issue,&quot; said Brandon Fradd, a biotechnologyanalyst with Montgomery Securities. &quot;Even if the virus isdead, what if someone got HIV and was somehow infected fromthis thing? The chances of this happening are extraordinarilyremote, but not zero.&quot; He notes that a batch of the virusmight not be properly inactivated. Mr. Fradd adds, however,that the company's main focus has always been to use such avaccine as a therapy for individuals already infected withHIV.   Scott Putney, a leading AIDS scientist now with AlkermesInc., says that &quot;it's theoretically possible that a problemcould happen, but it would be a very rare event.&quot; He addsthat the technology to make such vaccines has been developedto the point that &quot;you could assure with great certainty thatthe virus has been inactivated.&quot; Dr. Putney says his realreservation with such a killed-virus vaccine is that itsimply may not work on uninfected patients.   The Immune Response spokesman stressed that &quot;our focus,and 99% of our efforts so far have been dedicated toward atreatment for already infected patients.&quot; The San Diegocompany has no product sales as yet, but all of its $4.3million in total research revenue for 1991 were for clinicaltrials and work on infected patients.   In late over-the-counter trading, Immune Response shareswere quoted at $28.50, up 25 cents a share.   In addition to disclosing the delay in the clinicaltrials, Immune Response yesterday announced that it hascompleted a study showing that a certain method or &quot;surrogatemarker&quot; can successfully identify the amount of the viruspresent in human blood, and that higher virus quantitiescorrelate with different stages of AIDS. The results of thestudy, published in the current issue of AIDS Research andHuman Retroviruses, give the company a more reliablebenchmark to measure progress or lack of such in patientsundergoing clinical trials of Immune Response's HIV vaccine.   Last November, a Food and Drug Administration advisorypanel said that one such surrogate marker couldn't be used asthe sole indicator for regulatory approval and that clinicalindicators, which typically involve longer trial periods,would remain an important factor. But the Immune Responsespokesman said the company hoped that its marker, combinedwith others being studied, would prompt the FDA to reconsiderthe issue.</TEXT></DOC>
