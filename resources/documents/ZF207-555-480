(excerpts from book on hacker espionage)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Stoll, Clifford.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>Me, a wizard?andM;Until a week before, I had been an astronomer, contentedly designingtelescope optics.andP;  But then I found myself transferred from the KeckObservatory at the Lawrence Berkeley Lab (LBL) down to the computer center inthe basement of the same building.andM;On either side of my new cubicle were the offices of two systems people,Wayne Graves and Dave Cleveland, the old hands of the system.andP;  Together,Wayne, Dave, and I were to run the computers as a labwide utility.andP;  Wemanaged a dozen mainframe computers-giant workhorses for solving physicsproblems, together worth around $6 million.andP;  The scientists using thecomputers were supposed to see a simple, powerful computing system, asreliable as the electric company.andP;  This meant keeping the machines runningfull-time, around the clock.andP;  And just like a utility company, we charged forevery cycle of computing that was used.andM;On my second day, Dave was mumbling about a hiccup in the Unix accountingsystem.andP;  Someone must have used a few seconds of computing time withoutpaying for it.andP;  The computer's books didn't quite balance; last month's billsof $2,387 showed a 75-cent shortfall.andM;Now, an error of a few thousand dollars is obvious, and isn't hard to find.andO;But errors in the pennies column arise from deeply buried problems, sofinding these bugs is a natural test for a budding software wizard.andM;Around about 7 p.m., my eye caught the name of one user, Hunter.andP;  This guydidn't have a valid billing address.andP;  Ha! Hunter had used 75 cents of time inthe past month, but nobody had paid for him.andP;  Here was the source of ourimbalance.andP;  Someone had screwed up while adding a user to our system.andP;  Atrivial problem caused by a trivial error.andM;A day later, an obscure computer named Dockmaster sent us an electronic-mailmessage.andP;  Its system manager claimed that someone from our laboratory hadtried to break into his computer over the weekend.andP;  I guessed Dockmaster wassome navy shipyard.andP;  It wasn't important, but it seemed worth spending a fewminutes looking into.andM;The message gave the date and time when someone on our Unix computer tried tolog in to Dockmaster's computer.andP;  Our stock Unix accounting file showed auser, Sventek, logging in to our system at 8:25, doing nothing for half anhour, and then disconnecting.andP;  No time-stamped activity in between.andP;  Ourhomebrew software also recorded Sventek's activity, but it showed him usingthe networks from 8:31 until 9:01 a.m.andM;Jeez.andP;  Another accounting problem.andP;  The timestamps didn't agree.andP;  Onerecorded activity when the other account said everything was dormant.andM;Why were the two accounting systems keeping different times? And why was someactivity logged in one file without showing up in the other? Was this relatedto the earlier accounting problem? Had I screwed things up when I pokedaround before? Or was there some other explanation-was there a hacker on theloose?andM;So how do you find a hacker? I figured it was simple: just watch for anyoneusing Sventek's accounts, and try to trace the connection.andP;  I spent Thursdaywatching people log in to the computer.andP;  I wrote a program to beep myterminal whenever someone connected.andM;At 12:33 on Thursday afternoon, Sventek logged in.andP;  I felt a rush ofadrenaline, then a complete letdown when he disappeared within a minute.andO;Where was he? The only pointer left for me was the identifier of histerminal: he had used terminal port tt23.andP;  I suspected a dial-in modem,connected ftom some telephone line, but it might conceivably be someone atthe laboratory.andM;By lucky accident, the connection had left some footprints behind.andP;  PaulMurray, a reclusive hardware technician who hides in thickets of telephonewire, had been collecting statistics on how many people used ourcommunications switchyard.andP;  By chance he had recorded the port numbers ofeach connection for the past month.andP;  Since I knew when Sventek was active onport tt23, we could figure out where he came from.andP;  The printout of thestatistics showed a one-minute, 1,200-bit-per-second connection had takenplace at 12:33.andM;Any lab employee here on the hill would run at high speed-9,600 or 19,200bps.andP;  Only someone calling through a modem would let his data dribble out a1,200-bps soda straw.andP;  But how to catch him? About the only place to watchour incoming traffic was in between the modems and the computers.andP;  Our modemlines were flat, 25-conductor wires, snaking underneath the switchyard'sfalse floor.andP;  A printer or personal computer could be wired in parallel witheach of these lines, recording every keystroke that came through.andM;A kludge? Yes.andP;  Workable? Maybe.andM;All we'd need were 50 teletypes, printers, and portable computers.andP;  I roundedthem up; strewn with four dozen obsolete teletypes and portable terminals,the floor looked like a computer engineer's nightmare.andP;  I slept in themiddle, nursing the printers and computers.andP;  Each was grabbing data from adifferent line, and whenever someone dialed our system, I'd wake up to thechatter of their typing.andP;  Every half-hour, a printer would run out of paperor a computer out of disk space, so I'd have to roll over and reload.andO;Saturday morning, a coworker shook me awake.andP;  &quot;Well, where's your hacker?&quot;andM;The first 49 printers and monitors showed nothing interesting.andP;  But from the50th trailed 80 feet of printout.andP;  During the night, someone had sneaked inthrough a hole in the operating system.andM;For three hours a hacker had strolled through my system, reading whatever hewished.andP;  Unknown to him, my DECwriter had saved his session on singlespacedcomputer paper.andP;  Here was every command he issued, every typing mistake, andevery response from the computer.andM;This printer monitored the line from Tymnet, a communications company thatinterconnected computers around the world.andP;  Our hacker might be anywhere.andM;How the Cuckoo Laid Its EggandM;The hacker had become a super-user.andP;  He was like a cuckoo bird.andP;  The cuckoois a nesting parasite that lays her eggs in other birds' nests: some otherbird will raise her young.andP;  The survival of cuckoo chicks depends on theignorance of other species.andP;  Our mysterious visitor had laid an egg-programinto our computer, letting the system hatch it and feed it privileges.andM;That morning, the hacker wrote a short program to grab privileges.andP;  Normally,Unix won't allow such a program to run, since it never gives privilegesbeyond what a user is assigned.andP;  But if our hacker ran this program from aprivileged account, he'd become privileged.andP;  His problem was to masqueradethis special program-the cuckoo's egg-so that it would be hatched by thesystem.andM;Every five minutes, the Unix system executes its own program called atrun.andO;In turn, atnin schedules other jobs and does routine housecleaning tasks.andP;  Itruns in a privileged mode, with the full power and trust of the operatingsystem behind it.andP;  If a bogus atrun program were substituted, it would beexecuted within five minutes, with full system privileges.andP;  For this reason,atrun sits in a protected area of the system, available only to the systemmanager.andP;  Nobody else has license to tamper with atrun.andM;Here was the cuckoo's nest: for five minutes he would swap his egg for thesystem's atrun program.andP;  For this attack, he needed to find a way to move hisegg-program into the protected systems nest.andP;  The operating system's barriersare built specifically to prevent this.andP;  But there was a wildcard that we'dnever noticed.andM;We used a powerful editing program called GnuEmacs.andP;  But Gnu's much more thanjust a text editor-it's a foundation upon which other programs can be built.andO;It even has its own mail facility built in.andP;  just one problem: there's a bugin that software.andM;Because of the way it was installed on our Unix computer, the Gnu-Emacseditor lets you forward a mail file from your own directory to anyone else's.andO;It doesn't check to see who's receiving it, or even whether they want thefile.andP;  No problem to send a file from your area to mine.andP;  But you'd betternot be able to move a file into the protected systems area: only the systemsmanager is allowed there.andM;Gnu didn't check.andP;  It let anyone move a file into protected systems space.andO;The hacker knew this; we didn't.andP;  He used Gnu to swap his special atrun filefor the system's legitimate version.andP;  Five minutes later, the system hatchedhis egg, and he held the keys to my computer.andM;In front of me, the first few feet of the printout showed the cuckoopreparing the nest, laying the egg, and waiting for it to hatch.andP;  The next 70feet showed the fledgling cuckoo testing its wings.andM;As a super-user, he had the run of our system and could read anybody's work.andO;By studying several scientists' command files and scripts, he discoveredpathways into other lab computers.andP;  Every night, our computer automaticallycalls 20 others, to exchange mail and network news.andP;  When the hacker readthese phone numbers, he learned 20 new targets.andM;I had to weave a net fine enough to catch the hacker but coarse enough to letour scientists through.andP;  I'd have to detect the hacker as soon as he cameonline and call Tymnet's technicians to trace the call.andM;If I knew the stolen account names, it would be easy to write a program thatwatched for the bad guy to show up.andP;  No need to check out every person usingthe computer; just ring a bell when a stolen account was in use.andP;  But I alsohad to stay invisible to the hacker, so I wrote the program for a new Unix-8system we had just installed.andP;  I could connect it to our local area network,secure it against all possible attacks, and let it watch the other computers,all the while recording the traffic on printers.andM;Wednesday afternoon, September 3, 1986, marked a week since we'd firstdetected the hacker.andP;  Suddenly, the terminal beeped twice: Sventek's accountwas active.andP;  I ran to the switchyard; the top of the ream of paper showedthat the hacker had logged in at 2:26 and was still active.andM;Logged in as Sventek, he first listed the names of everyone connected.andO;Lucky-there was nobody but the usual gang of physicists and astronomers; mywatchdog program was well concealed within the Unix-8 computer.andM;He didn't become a super-user; rather, he checked that the Gnu-Emacs filehadn't been modified.andP;  At 2:37, 11 minutes after logging in, he abruptlylogged off.andP;  But not before we'd started the trace.andM;Ron Vivier traces Tymnet's network within North America 'In a couple ofminutes he had traced the connection from LBL's Tymnet port into an OaklandTymnet office, where someone had dialed in.andM;It's easier to call straight into our Berkeley lab than to go throughOakland's Tymnet office.andP;  Calling the local Tymnet access number instead ofour lab was like taking the interstate to drive three blocks.andP;  But callingvia Tymnet added one more layer to trace.andP;  Whoever was at the other end ofthe line knew how to hide.andM;The morning after we had watched the hacker break in to our system, my bossmet with Aletha Owens, the lab's attorney.andP;  She wasted no time in calling theFBI.andM;Our local FBI office didn't raise an eyebrow.andP;  Fred Wyniken, special agentwith the Oakland resident agency, asked incredulously&quot;You're calling usbecause you've lost 75 cents in computer time?&quot; Owens tried explaininginformation security and the value of our data.andP;  Wyniken interrupted, &quot;Look,if you can demonstrate a loss of more than a million dollars, or thatsomeone's prying through classified data, then we'll open an investigation.andO;Until then, leave us alone.&quot;andM;Wednesday, September 10, at 7:51 a.m., the hacker appeared in our system forsix minutes.andP;  I wasn't at the lab to watch, but the printer saved three pagesof his trail.andP;  He logged in to our computer from Tymnet as Sventek, thenjumped into another network.andP;  Using Milnet, a network that links militarycomputers, he connected to address 26.0.0.113.andP;  He logged in there as Hunter,checked that they had a copy of Gnu-Emacs, and disappeared.andM;The hacker left an indelible trail downstream to the Redstone Army Depot inAnniston, Alabama, the home of the army's Redstone missile complex2,000 milesfrom Berkeley.andP;  He listed files at the Anniston system.andP;  judging from thedates of these files, he'd been in Anniston's computers since early June.andO;For four months, an illegitimate system manager had been using an armycomputer.andP;  Yet he'd been discovered by accident, not through some logic bombor lost information.andM;Looking closely at the morning's printout, I saw that, on the Annistoncomputer, the hacker had changed Hunter's password to Hedges.andP;  A clue atlast: of zillions of possible passwords, he'd chosen Hedges.andP;  Hedges Hunter?andO;Hunter Hedges? A hedge hunter?andM;Time was running out; if I didn't catch the hacker soon, the lab would shutdown my tracking operation and put me on other work.andP;  At 2:30 in theafternoon, the printer advanced a page and the hacker logged in with a newstolen account, Goran.andP;  A minute after the hacker connected, I called thephone company and Ron Vivier at Tymnet.andP;  I took notes as Ron mumbled.andP;  &quot;He'scoming into your port 14 and entering Tymnet from Oakland.andP;  It's our port322, which is, uh, let me see here.&quot; I could hear him tapping his keyboard.andO;&quot;Yeah, it's 2902.andP;  430-2902.andP;  That's the number to trace.'andM;The phone company, by law, couldn't reveal information about the trace to me,but my printers showed his every move.andP;  While I talked to Tymnet and thetelephone techs, the hacker had prowled through my computer.andP;  He wasn'tsatisfied reading the system manager's mail; he also snooped through mail forseveral nuclear physicists.andM;After 15 minutes of reading our mail, he jumped back into Goran's stolenaccount, using a new password, Benson.andP;  He started a program that searchedour users' files for passwords; while that executed, he called up the MilnetNetwork Information Center and asked for a pathway into the CIA.andM;Instead of their computer, though, he found four people who worked at theCIA.andP;  Later, I phoned one of them.andM;I didn't know where to begin.andP;  How do you introduce yourself to a spy?andM;&quot;Uh, you don't know me, but I'm a computer manager, and we've been followinga computer hacker.&quot;andM;&quot;Uh-huh.&quot; &quot;Well, he searched for a pathway to try to get into the CIA'scomputers.andP;  He found your name and phone number.&quot;andM;&quot;Who are you?&quot; Nervously, I told him, expecting him to send over a gang ofhit men in trench coats.andP;  I described our laboratory, making sure heunderstood that the People's Republic of Berkeley didn't have officialdiplomatic relations with his organization.andM;He sent over a delegation several days later.andP;  OK, so they didn't wear trenchcoats.andP;  Not even sunglasses.andP;  just boring suits and ties.andP;  Wayne saw the fourof them walk up the drive and flashed a message to my terminal: &quot;All hands ondeck.andP;  Sales reps approach through starboard portal.andP;  Charcoal gray suits.andO;Set warp speed to avoid IBM sales pitch.&quot; If only he knew.andM;The four spooks introduced themselves.andP;  One guy in his fifties said he wasthere as a &quot;navigator&quot; and didn't give his name-he just sat there quietly thewhole time.andP;  The second spy, Greg Fennel, I guessed to be a computer jockey,because he seemed uncomfortable in a suit.andP;  The third agent, Teejay, wasbuilt like a halfback.andP;  The fourth guy must have been the bigwig: everyoneshut up when he talked.andP;  Together, they looked more like bureaucrats thanspies.andM;The four of them sat quietly while we gave them an overview of what we'dseen.andP;  Mr.andP;  Big nodded and asked, &quot;What keywords has he scanned for?&quot;andM;&quot;He looks for words like password, nuclear, SDI, and Norad He's picked somecurious passwords: lblhack hedges, jaeger, hunter, and benson.andP;  The accountshe stole, Goran, Sventek, Whitberg, and Mark don't say much about him,because the names are people here at the laboratory.&quot;andM;Mr.andP;  Big nodded and asked, &quot;Tell me, what did he do at Anniston?&quot;andM;&quot;I don't have much of a printout there,&quot; I said.andP;  &quot;He was into their systemfor several months, perhaps as long as a year.andP;  Now, since he knows they'vedetected him, he logs in only for a moment.&quot;andM;Mr.andP;  Big fidgeted a bit, meaning that the meeting was about to break up.andO;Greg asked one more question.andP;  &quot;What machines has he attacked?&quot;andM;&quot;Ours, of course, and the army base in Anniston.andP;  He's tried to get intoWhite Sands Missile Range, and some navy shipyard in Maryland.andP;  I think it'scalled Dockmaster.&quot;andM;&quot;Shit!&quot; Greg and Teejay simultaneously exclaimed.andP;  Greg said, &quot;How do youknow he hit Dockmaster?&quot;andM;&quot;About the same time he screwed up our accounting, this Dockmaster place sentus a message saying that someone had tried to break in there.&quot;andM;&quot;Did he succeed?&quot; &quot;I don't think so.andP;  What is this Dockmaster place, anyway?andO;Aren't they some navy shipyard?&quot;andM;They whispered among themselves, and Mr.andP;  Big nodded.andP;  Greg explained:&quot;Dockmaster isn't a navy shipyard.andP;  It's run by the National SecurityAgency.&quot;andM;A hacker breaking into the NSA? Bizarre.andP;  This wanted to get into the CIA,the NSA, army missile bases, and the NorthandM;American Air Defense headquarters.andP;  &quot;Dockmaster is NSA's only unclassifiedcomputer,&quot; Greg said.andP;  &quot;It belongs to its computer security group, which isactually public.&quot;andM;Mr.andP;  Big started talking slowly.andP;  &quot;There's not much we can do about thisaffair.andP;  I think there's no evidence of foreign espionage.&quot;andM;&quot;Well, who should be working on this case?&quot; I asked.andM;&quot;The FBI.andP;  I'm sorry, but this isn't our bailiwick.andP;  Our entire involvementhas been the exposure of four names-names that are already in the publicdomain, I might add.&quot;andM;Then they were gone.andM;The spooks were no help, so I was on my own again.andP;  I searched the Berkeleyphone book for Jaegers and Bensons; I figured I ought to try Stanford aswell.andP;  So I stopped by the library.andP;  Maggie Morley, our 45-year-olddocumentmeister, plays rough-and-tumble Scrabble: posted on her door is alist of all legal three-letter Scrabble words.andM;&quot;I need a Stanford telephone book,&quot; I I'm looking for everyone in SiliconValley named Jaeger or Benson.&quot;andM;'Jaeger.andP;  A word that's been kind to me,&quot; Maggie smiled.andP;  &quot;Worth 16 points,but I once won a game with it, when the [J] landed on a triple-letter score.andO;Turned into 75 points.&quot;andM;&quot;Yeah, but I need it because it's the hacker's password.andP;  Hey, I didn't knownames were legal in Scrabble.&quot;andM;&quot;Jaeger's not a name.andP;  Well, maybe it's a nameEllsworth jaeger, the famousomithologist, for instance-but it's a type of bird.andP;  Gets its name from theGerman word meaning hunter.&quot;andM;&quot;Huh? Did you say hunter?&quot;andM;&quot;Yes.andP;  Jaegers are hunting birds that badger other birds with full beaks.andO;They harass weaker birds until they drop their prey.&quot;andM;&quot;Hot ziggity! You answered my question.andP;  I don't need the phone book.&quot;andM;&quot;Well, what else I can do for you?&quot;andM;&quot;How about explaining the relationship between the words hedges, jaeger,hunter, and benson?&quot;andM;&quot;Well, jaeger and hunter is obvious to anyone who knows German.andP;  And smokersknow Benson andamp; Hedges.&quot;andM;Omigod-my hacker smokes Benson andamp; Hedges.andP;  Maggie had won on a triple-wordscore.andM;During one of the phone traces, I had copied down all the numbers and digitsI heard from the technician.andP;  I called all combinations of them and ended upat a computer modem at Mitre, a defense contractor just down the road fromCIA headquarters in McLean, Virginia.andP;  How deeply was Mitre's systeminfested? By listing its directory, I saw that the hacker had created aTrojan horse there on June 17.andP;  For six months, someone had silentlybooby-trapped Mitre's computers.andM;In alllikelihood, Mitre served as a way station, a stepping-stone on the wayto breaking into other computers.andP;  Someone dialed into Mitre, turned around,and dialed out from it.andP;  This way, Mitre paid the bills both ways: theincoming Tymnet connection and the outgoing long-distance phone call.andP;  Evennicer, Mitre served as a hiding place, a hole in the wall that couldn't betraced.andM;Monday morning, I called a man named Bill Chandler at Mitre and told him thenews.andP;  Bill wanted me to be quiet about the problems I had found.andP;  Well, yes,but I had a price.andM;&quot;Say, Bill, could you send me copies of your computer's phone bills?&quot;andM;&quot;What for?&quot; &quot;It might be fun to see where else this hacker got into.&quot;andM;Two weeks later, a thick envelope arrived, stuffed with long-distance billsfrom Chesapeake and Potomac.andP;  Six months of phone bills.andP;  Dates, times, phonenumbers, and cities.andP;  Probably 5,000 in all.andP;  So many that I couldn't analyzethem by hand.andP;  Perfect for analyzing on a computer-there's plenty of softwaredesigned to search out correlations.andP;  All I had to do was enter them into myMacintosh computer and run a few programs.andM;Ever type 5,000 phone numbers? It's as boring as it sounds.andP;  And I had to doit twice, to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.andP;  Took me two days.andM;After running an analysis, I found that this hacker hadn't just broken intomy computer.andP;  He was into more than six, and possibly a dozen.andM;From Mitre, the hacker had made long connections to Norfolk, Oak Ridge,Omaha, San Diego, Pasadena, Livermore, and Atlanta.andM;At least as interesting: he had made hundreds of one-minute phone calls, allacross the country.andP;  To air force bases, navy shipyards, aircraft builders,and defense contractors.andP;  What can you learn from a oneminute phone call toan army proving ground?andM;For six months, this hacker had been breaking into bases and computers allacross the country.andP;  Nobody knew it.andP;  He was out there, alone, silent,anonymous, persistent, and apparently successful-but why? What was he after?andO;What had he already learned? And what was he doing with this information?andO;Friday, December 5, the hacker showed up again at 1:21 in the afternoon.andO;Nine minutes later, he disappeared.andM;Enough time for me to trace the connection to Tymnet.andP;  But the network'ssorcerer, Ron Vivier, was taking a long lunch that day, soandM;Tymnet couldn't make the trace.andP;  Another chance lost.andM;Ron returned my call an hour later.andM;&quot;Hey, Cliff, how come you never call me at night?&quot;andM;&quot;Guess the hacker doesn't show up at night.andP;  I wonder why.&quot; He started methinking.andP;  My logbook recorded every time the hacker had shown up.andP;  On theaverage, when was he active?andM;I'd remembered him on at 6 a.m.andP;  and at 7 p.m.andP;  But never at midnight.andP;  Isn'tmidnight operation the very image of a hacker?andM;On the average, the hacker showed up at noon, Pacific time.andP;  So what did thismean? Suppose he lives in California.andP;  Then he's hacking during the day.andP;  Ifhe's on the East Coast, he's three hours ahead of us, so he works around 3 or4 in the afternoon.andM;This didn't make sense.andP;  He'd work at night to save on long-distancetelephone fees.andP;  To avoid network congestion.andP;  And to avoid detection.andP;  Yethe brazenly breaks in during the day.andP;  Why?andM;When it's noon in California, I wondered, where is it evening? Lunchtime inBerkeley is bedtime in Europe.andP;  Was the hacker coming from Europe?andM;On a Saturday afternoon, the hacker hit again.andP;  I called Tymnet's Ron Vivierat home.andM;&quot;I've got a live one for you,&quot; I gasped.andP;  &quot;Just trace my port 14.&quot;andM;&quot;Right.andP;  It'll take a minute.&quot; A couple of eons passed, and Ron came back onthe line.andP;  &quot;Hey, Cliff, are you certain that it's the same guy?,&quot;andM;I watched the hacker searching for the word ]DI on our computer&quot;Yes, it'shim.&quot;andM;&quot;He's coming in from a gateway that I've never heard of.andP;  I'm locked onto hisnetwork address, so it doesn't matter if he hangs up.andP;  But the guy's comingfrom somewhere strange.&quot;andM;&quot;Where's that?&quot;andM;&quot;I don't know.andP;  It's Tymnet node 3513, which is a strange one.andP;  I'll have tolook it up in our directory.&quot; In the background, Ron's keyboard clicked.andO;&quot;Here it is.andP;  Your hacker is coming from outside the Tymnet system.andP;  He'sentering Tymnet from a communications line operated by the InternationalTelephone and Telegraph company.&quot;andM;&quot;So what?&quot;andM;&quot;ITT takes a Westar downlink, the communications satellite over the Atlantic.andO;It handles ten or twenty thousand phone calls at once.&quot;andM;&quot;So my hacker is coming from Europe?&quot;andM;&quot;For sure.&quot;andM;&quot;Where?&quot;andM;&quot;That's the part I don't know, and I probably can't find out.andP;  But hold on,and I'll see what's there.&quot; More keyboard clicks.andM;Ron came back to the phone.andP;  &quot;Well, ITT identifies the line as DSEA 744031.andO;That's their line number.andP;  It can connect to either Spain, France, Germany,or Britain.&quot;andM;&quot;Well, which is it?&quot; &quot;Sorry, I don't know.andP;  In three days they'll send usbilling information, and then I can find out.andP;  Meantime, I can't tell youmuch more than that.&quot;andM;Ron rang off, but the hacker was still on my computer, trying to chisel intothe Navy Research Labs, when one of Tymnet's international specialists, SteveWhite, called.andM;&quot;Ron can't trace any farther,&quot; Steve said.andP;  &quot;I'll do the trace myself&quot;andM;I kept watching the hacker on my screen, hoping that he wouldn't hang upwhile Steve made the trace.andM;Steve came back on the line.andP;  In his modulated, almost theatrical Britishaccent, he said, &quot;Your hacker has the calling address DNIC dash 2624 dash542104214.&quot;andM;&quot;So where's the hacker coming from?&quot;andM;&quot;West Germany.andP;  The German Datex network.&quot;andM;&quot;What's that?&quot;andM;&quot;It's their national network to connect computers together.andP;  We'll have tocall the Bundespost to find out more.&quot;andM;&quot;Who's the Bundespost?&quot;andM;&quot;They're the German national postal office.andP;  The government communicationsmonopoly.&quot;andM;Steve seemed pessimistic about completing a successful &quot;We know where heconnects into the system.andP;  But there's a couple of possibilities there.andP;  Thehacker might be at a computer in Germany, simply connected over the GermanDatex network.andP;  If that's the case, then we've got him cold, We know hisaddress, the address points to his computer, and the computer points to him.&quot;andM;&quot;It is unlikely.andP;  More likely, the hacker is coming into the German Datexnetwork through a dial-in modem.&quot;andM;Just like Tymnet, Datex let anyone dial into its system and connect tocomputers on the network.andP;  Perfect for businesspeople and scientists.andP;  Andhackers.andM;&quot;The real problem is in German law,&quot; Steve said.andP;  &quot;I don't think theyrecognize hacking as a crime.&quot;andM;&quot;You're kidding, of course.&quot; &quot;No,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;A lot of countries haveoutdated laws.andP;  In Canada, a hacker who broke into a computer was convictedof stealing electricity, ratherandM;than trespassing.andP;  He was prosecuted only because the connection had used amicrowatt of power from the computer.&quot;andM;Steve's pessimism was contagious.andP;  But his trace jogged my spirits.andP;  So whatif we couldn't nail the hacker-our circle was closing around him.andM;Germany.andP;  I remembered my librarian recognizing the hacker's password.andO;&quot;Jaeger-it's a German word meaning hunter.&quot; The answer had been right infront of me, but I'd been blind.andM;Some details were still fuzzy, but I understood how he operated.andP;  Somewherein Europe, the hacker called into the German Datex network.andP;  He asked forTymnet, and the Bundespost made the connection.andP;  Once he reached the States,he connected to my laboratory and hacked his way around Milnet.andM;Mitre must have been his stopover point.andP;
