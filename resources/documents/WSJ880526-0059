Rundle (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FGRP BTI EUROP MDEST </CO><IN> TNM INS </IN><DATELINE> LOS ANGELES  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Farmers Group Inc. said that ownership or control of B.A.T Industries PLC stock by British government entities and by other foreign governments might be an obstacle to B.A.T's $4.5 billion hostile takeover bid for Farmers.    Based on Farmers' calculation, about 13.4% of B.A.T's shares are owned or controlled by Abu Dhabi, Kuwait and Brunei and by various British government entities. B.A.T disputes that figure, but a spokesman said he couldn't immediately give a correct percentage, or say whether any B.A.T shares are owned by any foreign government.    &quot;There is no government ownership of B.A.T under our interpretation of the statute,&quot; the spokesman stated. B.A.T is a London-based tobacco, retailing and financial services concern.    The California state insurance code prohibits ownership, operation or control of insurance companies by domestic or foreign government entities, both sides agree. But they disagree on what constitutes ownership or control, and over the definition of a &quot;government entity.&quot;    The dispute surfaced earlier this week in hearings before the state insurance department on B.A.T's application for regulatory clearance of its $63-a-share tender offer for Los Angeles-based Farmers. Farmers has rejected the bid as inadequate and is fighting B.A.T's applications for permission from nine states to acquire Farmers.    Farmers maintains that in past California insurance department reviews of change-of-ownership requests, ownership of any percentage of stock by a foreign government has been deemed to violate the code. B.A.T, relying on a 1984 letter written by the department's chief counsel, says individual foreign ownership stakes of 2% or less are &quot;insignificant&quot; and shouldn't trigger the code prohibition.    Under Farmers' interpretation, &quot;Farmers' itself couldn't operate&quot; in California, the B.A.T spokesman asserted. Shares in &quot;more than 300 California insurance companies,&quot; including Farmers, are owned by state pension funds, which Farmers defines as &quot;government entities,&quot; he said.    Roxani Gillespie, the state insurance commissioner, said it would be &quot;inappropriate&quot; to comment until the matter is decided. She said the department will rule on B.A.T's application within two weeks after the hearings end, which is expected tomorrow.    B.A.T's takeover bid would be dealt a setback if any state denies regulatory approval, but B.A.T could appeal the decision to a state court. None of the states has yet ruled. </TEXT></DOC>
