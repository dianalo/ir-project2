He and his bride of 13 months were planning to cookThanksgiving dinner for my wife and I, so to make it more enjoyable, I broughtsome 1960 Cabernet Sauvignon from Charles Krug, as well as a 1960 LouisMartini Cabernet Sauvignon to match the turkey, stuffing and salad.;   Dessert was pecan pie, pumpkin pie and cherry pie. With the desserts, my sonoffered a 1978 Croft Qunita de Roeda Port.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Food  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  HOW TO FIND GREAT WINES FROM BAD VINTAGES  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Food and Wine  </MEMO><TEXT>     Now 1978 was a disaster for port. It was so bad that only four of the 65port producers declared 1978 as a vintage wine. Croft was one of them. Winelike this is rarely seen in the United States because there is so little ofit, and if any were shipped to the States, the price would be high.;    Iasked Christopher where he found this wine and he said he had been an hourearly for an appointment in Albany, so he browsed around Solano Cellars wineshop.;    &quot;I saw this '78 port,&quot; he said, &quot;and remembered what you taught usabout vintages. I knew it had to be a bargain.&quot; I was flattered by thecompliment, but the advice was not original. It came from my friend AlexisLichine.;    I met Lichine in the fall of 1960 when he accepted my invitationto conduct a wine tasting for the press at the Chicago Press Club.;   Afterward Lichine and I talked into the wee hours of the morning about foodand wine. We got around to the subject of vintage charts and how useful theywere and he had plenty to say.;    &quot;Vintage charts are only overviews of aregion,&quot; Lichine said. &quot;You can't condemn a winery because the region didn'tfare very well. You have to look at each individual wine. No respectful winerywould put their name on a bad bottle of wine.&quot;;    Lichine then told me thesecret of drinking great wines at bargain prices: Pick vintages that have beendowngraded and wines made from that vintage.;    One of my favorite wines is aFrench burgundy from Morey St. Denis, called Clos de Tart. The first time Itasted this wine was in the fall of 1961. The vintage was 1955. It was thefinest French burgundy I had ever tasted. So I bought as much of the '55 as Icould afford.;    In the ensuing years, I drank other vintages. So when I sawa 1975 Clos de Tart in a South Bay wine shop at $39 a bottle in a vintage thatwas written off as a disaster, I recalled what Lichine had said aboutrespectful wineries. Two months later, the wine was on sale for $29. Still toorich. Two more months past and the price dropped to $19. Six months later, thewine was put in the closeout barrel where it was $9.95 a bottle. I bought thelast 17 bottles the store had. The wine is superb.;    My son Christopher didthe same thing with the port. He knew that 1978 was a bad year for port. Healso knew that Croft is an impeccable port house and they wouldn't taint theirname by offering bad bottles of port. In addition, the price was lowered to$14.95 from $25. The wine is excellent, drinkable now and can be held untilthe year 2000. I have added some to my cellar. So has Christopher.;    Here ishow to use this secret to your advantage:;    (check) Make a list of the winesyou cannot do without.;    (check) Make a list of the poor vintages. One ofthe best books detailing vintages of red and white bordeauxs, red and whiteburgundys, German wines, champagnes, port, madeira, tokay, sherry, Californiaand Australian wines, is Michael Broadbent's &quot;The Great Vintage Wine Book&quot;published by Alfred Knopf.

Add the wine,  saltand pepper. Cover and cook the mixture until the onions are soft. Add thepaprika and reduce the liquid until it evaporates. Remove the mixture and keepit warm. Flour the breasts.

Serves 2.;    Winesuggestions: Try a 1989 Navarro Gewurztraminer, Anderson Valley. It's a dry,flowery wine blended from four cuvees and aged in German and French oak or a1987 Clos du Bois Merlot that boasts a 23 percent mixture of cabernetsauvignon, which adds balance and length to this wine.; Bad vintages; Here's alook at off years that might produce some special finds.; France; Bordeaux                          1972, 1977; Sauternes              1972, 1974, 1977,1984; Red burgundy                 1975, 1980, 1984; White burgundy              1975, 1980, 1984; Rhone                                    1984; ...;Germany; Mosel/Saar/Ruwer  1977, 1978, 1980, 1982, 1984; Rhine 1977, 1978,            1980, 1982, 1984; ...; Italy; Chianti                            1976, 1984; Barolo            1975, 1976, 1977, 1981, 1984; Amarone                            1981, 1984; ...; California; Cabernet                        1979; ...; Portugal; Port                             1978  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Malcolm Hebert column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910109  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  CHART  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,002  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, January 9, 199100009073,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
