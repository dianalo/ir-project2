The new ceiling takes effect today. On April 13, VA officials raised the rate for the first time in more than two years, to 9.5%, in response to sharp rate increases in the private mortgage market. Rates had been falling steadily, reaching 8.5% in January. The current increase marks the first time since March 1986 that the VA rate was at 10% or above.    The increased rate raises the monthly payment on the average $70,000, 30-year fixed-rate mortgage to $614 from $589. The VA also raised rates on its other loan programs, including home improvement loans, by half a percentage point.    Private mortgage lenders welcomed the increase, saying it demonstrates &quot;responsiveness to market conditions,&quot; according to Warren Lasko, executive vice president of the Mortgage Bankers Association. &quot;Interest rates have taken off like a rocket in recent weeks.&quot;    Because the VA rate has lagged behind the private mortgage market, lenders have been asking as many as 10 discount points on VA loans, said Mr. Lasko. A point is 1% of the loan amount. </TEXT></DOC>
