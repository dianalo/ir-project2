The independent South African Press Association said an officialU.S. announcement ``is expected to be made soon,'' saying SouthAfrica would not meet its Tuesday target to begin withdrawing fromthe territory, popularly called Namibia.   The withdrawal was to lead to June 1 independence electionssupervised by the United Nations, which Pretoria defied to continueits 73-year rule of Namibia.   South Africa set the Tuesday date and the government's officialstance Monday was that the target holds, but it would not beresponsible if other parties were not ready.   South African newspapers have reported recently that PresidentP.W. Botha is seeking to begin the independence process on Jan. 1,1989, since it became clear Tuesday's deadline would not be met.   ``We're prepared to move at any time,'' said Louis Pienaar,South Africa's administrator for the territory.   But South Africa's proposal was contingent on an agreement forthe departure of 50,000 Cuban troops supporting the Marxistgovernment in Angola, Namibia's northern neighbor.   South Africa, Cuba, Angola and U.S. mediators have held periodictalks since May, but have been unable to set a timetable for Cubantroops to withdraw. No new date has been set to resume negotiations.   The South African agency said that in New York early this month,U.S. mediator Chester Crocker had asked for responses to thecompromise plan by Oct. 12. Crocker is Undersecretary of State forAfrican Affairs.   ``South Africa, according to informed sources here, met thedeadline, but the other two have not yet responded,'' SAPA reportedfrom Pretoria.   It said the U.S. plan called for half the Cubans to leave Angolabefore elections in Namibia and the remainder to move north of the15th parallel. This would distance them from the Namibian border sothey could not support South-West Africa People's Organizationguerrillas who have been fighting South African rule for more thantwo decades.   The second stage, SAPA reported, would involve reducing theCuban strength to one-fourth its present strength by the end of thefirst year. Remaining Cuban troops would leave by the end of thesecond year.</TEXT></DOC>
