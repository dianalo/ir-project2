But the reaction of Albert L. Sieg, a U.S. businessman inTokyo, is more subdued. &quot;The parties have agreed at thenegotiating level,&quot; said the president of the Eastman Kodak(Japan) Ltd. subsidiary, and a vice president of the AmericanChamber of Commerce in Japan. &quot;But we've been talking aboutnegotiations and commitments for a long, long time. Thequestion is whether there's any follow-through or not. Thereisn't any reason Americans shouldn't be skeptical.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   It took four days of around-the-clock bargaining last weekto produce blueprints for reforming the Japanese and U.S.economies. But the two governments still put off until Julythe key question in the minds of American government andbusiness veterans of the bilateral trade battle: how theagreement will be monitored and enforced. That, they say,will determine whether this is truly a turning point, orlargely an academic exercise.   Japan's 32-page plan is filled with many potentiallysignificant promises for reform. But they are largely vaguestatements about &quot;strictly enforcing&quot; certain laws and&quot;resorting to more formal actions.&quot; Many have been madebefore. Even the few specific pledges, such as simplifyingJapan's contorted distribution system, face political hurdlesbefore they can be adopted.   And even then, such changes can be effectively thwarted byother measures. Less than an hour after the talks broke up inWashington Thursday night, the Ministry of InternationalTrade and Industry held a news conference in Tokyo stressingthe limits of what the Japanese had promised.   Thus, most Americans invoke the conventional wisdom thatunless the U.S. applies continual pressure, the Japanesegovernment won't have the power or conviction to fulfill itspromises. &quot;It's imperative that there be a full Americanstaff in Tokyo with adequate authority to follow up,&quot; arguesJohn P. Stern, head of the American Electronics Association'sJapan office. &quot;I'm concerned the U.S. does not have adequateresources in Japan to monitor enforcement of the agreement.&quot;   The document released last week was the interim report ofthe Structural Impediments Initiative, sweeping discussionsborn last year out of frustration with the endlesssector-specific trade haggles. The idea was to knock downsome of the systemic causes of the $49 billion bilateraltrade imbalance. Thus, the focus was on long-term reformsthat likely won't bear fruit soon, such as shifting theorientation of Japan's economy toward consumption and awayfrom production. The final report is due by early July.   On the U.S. side of the ledger, American trade officialsthemselves acknowledge that most of the problems are domestic-- a low savings rate, a high federal budget deficit and poorpublic education to name a few. The structural talks aresupposed to be a &quot;two-way street,&quot; and the plan to change theU.S. economy, also released last week, is as vague as theJapanese. Moreover, the reforms cited may prove even moredifficult to bring about given the political and fiscalconstraints faced by the Bush administration.   But, as a top member of the American delegation said afterthe reports were released, &quot;one side {of the street} islonger than the other,&quot; meaning that most of the pressurefalls on Japan.   The Japanese plan, if totally implemented as the Americansunderstand it, would mean dramatic societal changes,essentially wresting major decisions from the big businessesand big government that so heavily rule the economy, andturning more control over to the free market.   But Japan has made such pledges before. In 1986,then-Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone commissioned a studyunder Bank of Japan's former governor, Haruo Maekawa, whichcalled for &quot;economic structural adjustment for internationalharmony.&quot; That report helped trigger a major shift in theJapanese economy from one driven by exports to one pushed bydomestic demand. Yet it failed to deliver many liberalizingmeasures, some of which are repeated in last week's report.   Many of the political obstacles to change three years agostill exist today. The most significant proposal in Japan'sSII interim plan is an overhaul of a law protectinginefficient mom-and-pop shops.   The Americans say the law effectively blocks many foreignstores from setting up in Japan, and also discourages theopening of large Japanese stores, which are more likely tocarry imported goods. The Japanese government itself says thelaw hurts consumers.   But any talk of change irritates the politically powerful1.6 million small retailers. &quot;The decision will do nothingbut weaken minor retailers, devastate shopping districts, andslow down economic and cultural development of the community,the Federation of Specialty Stores Associations said in astatement. The group vowed to do its best to prevent thedecisions from being enforced.   It has many levers to pull. Some of the changes requirelegislative approval, and the ruling Liberal DemocraticParty, which has endorsed the package, doesn't control theupper house of the Diet. The opposition parties may try tograb even more of the LDP power base by promising to rejectthe revisions of the law. So far, however, the opposition hasbeen surprisingly quiet on the SII proposals.   The retailers say they will also appeal to localauthorities, who may have the power to enact their ownlegislation effectively nullifying any change made at thenational level. A recent survey of a dozen major municipalgovernments showed many would consider enacting some sort ofprotection if the national changes proved damaging to smallretailers. &quot;There's a concern that the regions will respondby tightening laws -- they don't feel the pressure from theU.S.,&quot; said Weeks Ringle, a retail analyst with W.I. Carr(Overseas) Ltd., a unit of France's Banque Indosuez, inTokyo.   Other reforms mentioned in the Japanese package remainvague. The government said it would increase the penalty forantitrust violations, but doesn't mention a number. Itpromises to increase spending on public works -- a moveAmericans say will shift the orientation of the economyfurther away from exports and more toward domesticconsumption -- but doesn't specify by how much.   Some of those details will likely appear in the Julyreport, and then give a clearer picture about how seriouslythe Japanese government takes the U.S. government's demands.   But other promises require general changes in everdaybehavior and attitudes, and are almost impossible to writeinto an agreement. Many of the proposals, aimed at curbingclose business ties, rely on a more vigorous Japan Fair TradeCommission. But even increasing the staff and budget of thatbureaucracy won't guarantee that the commission, which has ahistory of lax enforcement, will pursue cases Americansconsider antitrust violations. Some American businessmen feara tougher FTC will simply target them. Indeed, a recent JFTCreport concluded that a major cause of high prices in Japanwas high markups by importers.</TEXT></DOC>
