(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A wild golden eagle was recoveringWednesday from surgery on both wings after it was found shot, andveterinarians concentrated on building up the feeble bird's strength.   State and federal authorities sought the public's help indetermining who shot the bird in southern Kentucky.   ``It's in a very poor nutritional state,'' said Dr. Loran Wagonerof the Skyline Animal Clinic. ``It apparently had been shot forabout a week before it was caught.''   The adult male, 10 pounds with a 6-foot wingspan, was foundTuesday by three state highway department employees near SharonGrove. The workers turned the wounded bird over to Sgt. GeraldBarnett of the state Department of Fish and Wildlife in Elkton.   Four veterinarians performed surgery on the eagle at the animalclinic.   ``The upper bones in both wings were broken'' when the eagle washit with buckshot, Wagoner said. ``We have intramedullary pinsholding the bones tight. It will be a matter of him strengtheninghis bones again before he can fly.''   Of more immediate concern to Wagoner is building the eagle'sstrength so it can be taken to the Louisville Zoo for recovery.   ``Right now, we're trying to feed him chicken parts and beef,''he said. ``We've managed to get a little bit down by force-feedinghim.''   Wagner said it's important that the eagle be transferred to thezoo soon.   ``They lose the will to live,'' he explained. ``Even though thezoo has a controlled environment, it is more familiar to the bird.It's important not to handle them any more than necessary.''   Although the bird is weak, its ability to perch is a goodindicator that it may recover, Wagoner said.   Barnett said a substantial reward would be offered forinformation on the shooting. Shooting a golden eagle or a bald eaglecarries a federal penalty of up to a $100,000 fine or one year inprison.</TEXT></DOC>
