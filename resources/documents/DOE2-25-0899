Even though the vast data base available at present canprovide only a site specific description of the phenomenon, already thismaterial gives relevant information on plutonium retention, metamictization,fission product release, hydrogeochemical stability and migration offission products. Generalized conclusions applicable to other nuclearwaste repository would require the quantitative reconstruction of t scoupled thermo-hydrologic-chemical processes. This could be achievedby studying the deviations in the /sup 2/H//sup 1/H and /sup 18/O//sup16/O ratios of minerals at Oklo. A further generalization of the findingsfrom Oklo could be realized by examining the newly-discovered reactorzone 10, which was active under very different thermal conditions thanthe other reactors. 205 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
