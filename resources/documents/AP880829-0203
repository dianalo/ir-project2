Although the National Action Party, or PAN, traditionallyMexico's leading opposition, maintains its presidential showingresulted largely through vote fraud, its leaders here and in otherregions are looking for new supporters for local elections inNovember and next year.   ``The PAN has a good product to sell to citizens but I thinkwhat's been missing is the knowledge of how to sell it,'' said RaulMonter, PAN committee president in Monterrey, the Nuevo Leon statecapital and northern Mexico's largest city with 2.8 million people.   Municipal elections are scheduled for Nuevo Leon state Nov. 9and these are seen as a crucial test for the PAN.   ``It's a problem of better organization, better preparation,''said Guillermo Prieto, PAN's president in northern Chihuahua state,where mayoral elections are set for next year.   The government's Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, wonthe July 6 presidential election with just barely more than 50percent of the vote. But it was an upstart center-left coalitionled by PRI-defector Cuauhtemoc Cardenas that loosened the PRI'stight grip on power in Mexico for 59 years.   The Cardenas front took 31 percent of the presidential vote andwon four Senate seats, a first-ever feat for an opposition ticketagainst the PRI.   At the same time, the PAN refuses to accept the presidentialresults on grounds of alleged PRI vote rigging.   While PAN joins the Cardenas opposition in formal protestsagainst the PRI, it still contends that the center-left coalitiondid so well in July because it is part of the ``PRI-government''system.   ``The government had to create an opposition to receive votesfrom those who are discontent with the system, to let them havetriumphs they never would have given the PAN,'' said Pablo EmilioMadero, PAN president for Nuevo Leon.   The PAN, which is nearly 50 years old, professes to be the onlyparty that can cleanse Mexico of government corruption, which itsays is the root of the current economic crisis and inadequateinfrastructure necessary for development.   With that platform, the PAN has won dozens of mayoral victories,especially in the northern states.   At one time the PAN held mayoralties representing 75 percent ofthe Chihuahua state population.   But it never has won a governorship in any of Mexico's 31states, and in most recent mayoral elections the PRI hassteamrolled back to power.   The result is that supporters who might ordinarily vote for PANoften stay home on election day in the belief they had little hopeof victory against the PRI.   ``The government achieves two goals when it commits voterfraud,'' claimed Madero. ``It wins elections and it discouragescitizen participation.''   Yet as candidate selection progresses for Nuevo Leon's mayoralelections, party leaders are acknowledging their failure to developa strong grassroots organization.   ``We need to go to the people, go to small meetings so thepeople can express their doubts,'' Madero said in an interview.``We need to convince more people to work for the party.''   Teresa Garcia de Madero, a Nuevo Leon state legislator who isseeking the nomination as PAN mayoral candidate for Monterrey, saidthe party needs candidates ``who don't campaign from behind adesk.''   Yet the PAN's ability to get candidates at all is an achievementin itself.   The PAN refuses to accept government funds available to allopposition parties, opting to raise money through donations orraffles. Most candidates finance their own campaigns, eliminatingthose who come from modest backgrounds.   ``Entering the PAN is not good business,'' said Ms. Garcia.   PRI candidates, meanwhile, have the unlimited backing of thegovernment treasury, and government employees are recruited to workfor the party.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Fri AMs, Sept. 2</NOTE></DOC>
