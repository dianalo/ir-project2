The restructuring, announced last December, blocked a $1.93 billion hostile takeover bid by Retail Partners, a company formed by Columbus, Ohio-based Limited Inc. and Edward J. DeBartolo Corp., a shopping center builder.    Carter Hawley disclosed the expected second-quarter loss as well as a deficit for its first half in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing covering $325 million of senior subordinated notes and debentures that are part of the restructuring plan. The latest second quarter ends August 1; in the year-earlier period, Carter Hawley earned $11.6 million, or 20 cents a share, on sales of $890.8 million. For the half, earnings were $26.1 million, on sales of $1.76 billion.    For the fourth quarter, Carter Hawley took a pre-tax charge of $25 million related to restructuring costs and reported a net loss of $24.2 million. The company had fourth-quarter operating income of $5.1 million before accounting for a separate $29.3 million net charge from early retirement of debt.    In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Carter Hawley shares closed at $66.125, up 37.5 cents.    The SEC filing said the second-quarter charges &quot;will result from direct transaction costs, the effect of a proposed change in fiscal year and possible reserves for potential operational and organizational changes.&quot; The change in the fiscal year would move the end of the year from Jan. 31 to July 31, and result in a second-quarter charge of $10.7 million stemming from the allocation of some fixed buying and other costs. A company spokesman declined to elaborate.    The restructuring plan requires shareholder approval. A meeting date hasn't been set, although the company has set June 29 as record date for the meeting.    Carter Hawley's restructuring plan calls for it to spin off its specialty chains, including Neiman-Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman, in a separate, publicly traded company. It would retain its department store chains, including The Broadway and Emporium Capwell. The specialty store company would be controlled by General Cinema Corp. of Chestnut Hill, Mass., which holds an option on 50.1% of Carter Hawley's stock.    The SEC filing said that Carter Hawley would use most of the proceeds of the offering to pay down existing debt and make a previously announced $17-a-share cash payment to shareholders.    The company further said it will allow shareholders the option of receiving Carter Hawley shares or stock in the new specialty store company in lieu of cash.    Under the plan, public stockholders would receive one share of stock in the new specialty store company and the cash payment, and would also keep their original Carter Hawley common shares.    Carter Hawley said it would finance the restructuring with debt including the $325 million of subordinated notes and debentures through Morgan Stanley and Co.; up to $350 million of mortgage financing through Prudential Insurance Co. of America, and a working capital loan of $318 million and a bridge loan of $80 million through Bankers Trust Co. of New York. </TEXT></DOC>
