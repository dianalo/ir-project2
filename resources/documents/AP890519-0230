The Senate gave final approval to next year's spending planThursday on a 63-37 vote. A majority of Democrats and Republicansvoted for the plan, and it was the earliest lawmakers have disposedof their guide for subsequent spending and taxing bills since 1978.   But things did not go quite as smoothly with the veterans'money, which lawmakers have been hoping to provide before they gohome for the upcoming Memorial Day recess.   On a voice vote, the House provided $1.2 billion for theDepartment of Veterans Affairs to help see the agency through theSept. 30 end of the 1989 fiscal year. The money would be forcompensation payments, health care, and other programs.   The Senate, on its own voice vote, only provided the agency withenough money to see it through June 15, estimated to be about $75million.   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said the Senate action``assures America's veterans that we've acted responsibly'' toprovide some funds while the differences with the House are ironedout.   Because Congress cannot send bills to the president for hissignature unless both chambers approve identical measures, thediscrepancy meant final action is not possible until the Housereturns to the capital next week.   The Senate left town Thursday evening until May 31, meaning thatif the House refuses to adopt the Senate's bill, the veterans'money will be unavailable at least until then.   The department and GOP lawmakers have said delays in providingthe money will mean diminished care for veterans at hospitals andclinics. Democrats have said that without the money, servicecutbacks would not occur for several weeks.   By providing only a piece of the veterans' money, the Senateleft the potential for a must-pass bill _ future legislationcontaining the rest of the veterans' funds _ to which otherprograms favored by senators can eventually be attached.   Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.,said there are ``many, many programs'' that need extra money thisyear. He cited $6.6 million he would like for a program that givessubsidies to air carriers that serve remote communities.   The veterans money had been held up in the House for severalweeks because it was part of a multi-billion-dollar packageproviding money for many programs this year. Hours of bargainingamong party leaders resulted in the veterans' funds being split offand considered separately.   An $822 million chunk of the original measure was for anti-drugprograms, which Democrats said was needed immediately andRepublicans said could wait until next year. Lawmakers plan toresume their dueling on that issue next week.   Congress' work on the 1990 budget proved predictablyuncontentious because the plan merely ratified a deficit-reductiondeal shaped last month between President Bush and congressionalleaders.   That pact achieved a claimed $28 billion in savings, cutting theprojected deficit to $99.7 billion _ just within the Gramm-Rudmanbalanced-budget law's 1990 target of $100 billion.   That agreement allowed Bush to honor his campaign pledge of ``nonew taxes,'' and Democrats to shield domestic programs fromspending slashes. This preserved political priorities, but evensupporters admitted it limited their ability to shrink the deficit.   ``For fiscal year 1990, there simply is no broad consensus inthis body in favor of higher taxes or deeper spending cuts,'' saidSenate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn.   The budget would pour additional money next year into domesticefforts for space, health, education and low-income assistance. Itrestrains the growth of defense spending to below the inflationrate, limiting it to $299.2 billion.   Additional tax receipts of $5.8 billion would have to becollected. Other savings would come from paring the growth ofMedicare by $2.3 billion, selling $5.7 billion worth of federalassets, and raising government fees by $2.7 billion.   About 15 percent of federal spending next year _ $181 billion _would go to pay interest on the national debt, which is projectedto grow to $2.8 trillion this summer.   The budget does not require the president's signature.</TEXT></DOC>
