BackgroundThe quality of mass transportation service depends in large part on thequality of the equipment used. Inspection of equipment at the time of itspurchase for compliance with the buyer's requirements is essential to ensuringquality mass transportation. Such inspection also assists in ensuring theproper use of Federal financial assistance. UMTA requires a recipient ofFederal financial assistance to provide adequate technical inspection andsupervision of all work in progress when it purchases equipment. UMTA permitsthis inspection and supervision to be done directly by the recipient orthrough technical consultants. The cost of the technical inspection andsupervision has always been eligible for UMTA funding. Additionally, UMTArequires that recipients comply with all the terms of their grant agreements,applicable statutes, codes, ordinances and safety standards.Because Congress was concerned about the quality of mass transportationequipment purchased with Federal financial assistance, and the inspectionand verification procedures used in the procurement process, the SurfaceTransportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987, Pub. L. 100-17,mandated pre-award and post-delivery audits with respect to any UMTA grantfor the purchase of buses or other rolling stock. Specifically, section319 of that Act directs UMTA, by delegation from the Secretary, to requirepre-award and post-delivery audits to ensure compliance with Federal motorvehicle safety requirements, the Buy America requirements of section 165of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982, as amended, and therecipient's own specified bid requirements. Additionally, section 319 providesthat UMTA must require independent inspection and audits, noting that amanufacturer's certification of compliance with certain requirements isnot sufficient. This notice of proposed rulemaking is issued to implementsection 319.B. The Proposed RegulationThe provisions of section 319 of the Surface Transportation and UniformRelocation Assistance Act of 1987 require a recipient of Federal financialassistance to take steps to ensure the quality of the equipment it purchaseswith that assistance. While section 319 applies to funds made availableunder the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964, as amended, UMTA intendsto extend the coverage of the proposed regulation to purchases of revenue-producingrolling stock with funds available under 23 U.S.C. 103(e)(4) and section14 of the National Capital Transportation Act of 1969, as amended (Stark-Harrislegislation; Pub. L. 96-184). UMTA does this under the general authorityavailable to the Secretary provided in the UMT Act and under the othertwo laws. UMTA believes that this consistency in approach will enhancethe Federal oversight of the transit program.The audits required by section 319 are to function as a double check forcompliance with existing requirements. While Congress made it clear thata certification from a manufacturer would not meet the requirements ofsection 319, language in the bill's conference report also provides that``[i]t is the intent of the Conferees that any paperwork requirements imposedby this provision will not create a significant cost burden.'' (House Report100-27, p. 231.) In an effort to limit the cost burden on grantees, theproposed regulation would allow the use of certifications by the granteewith independent support documentation whereever possible. These certificationswould be similar to other self-certifications UMTA currently uses underthe section 9 program, and would be maintained as part of a grantee's filesand subject to UMTA verification during the triennial review process orother UMTA audit or grant oversight review.Consistent with the provision's legislative history, the proposed regulation'sapplication is limited to rolling stock which carries passengers in revenueservice (House Report 99-665, p. 74). The proposed regulation would affectthe procurement of transit vehicles generally considered to be revenuerolling stock, including buses, vans, cars, railcars, locomotives, trolleycars and buses, ferry boats, and vehicles for fixed guideways and inclineplanes. The proposed regulation would not affect the procurement of vehiclesused for maintenance purposes, or other rolling stock which does not carrypassengers in revenue service. UMTA recognizes that cars and vans are certifiedfor safety by the manufacturer and that such certification is routinelyaccepted for other government purposes. UMTA requests comment on whethercars and vans should be treated differently than other rolling stock forpurposes of safety certification.C. Section-By-Section AnalysisThe proposed regulation is divided into three subparts. Subpart A setsout general information on the audit requirements. Subpart B describesthe pre-award audit and Subpart C describes the post-delivery audit.Subpart A has general information about the audit requirements. Sections663.1 and 663.3 set out the purpose and scope of the regulation. Section663.5 defines the terms used in the regulation, including ``revenue service''and ``rolling stock''. Section 663.7 sets out the pre-award and post-deliveryrequirement of section 319 of the Surface Transportation and Uniform RelocationAssistance Act of 1987. Section 663.9 reflects the language of section319 of the Act and lists the three components of the required audits. Theaudits are to verify compliance with (1) applicable Federal safety requirements,(2) Buy America requirements, and (3) bid specifications. This sectionalso states that these audits are separate from the single annual auditrequired by the Office of Management and Budget. In order to be consistentwith the law, the proposed regulation uses the term ``audit'' to referto the reviews mandated by the law. However, UMTA does not intend thatthe standards used for financial audits should be used on audits underthis proposed regulation. Section 663.11 reflects UMTA's position thatthe costs of testing and auditing a rolling stock purchase are eligiblecosts of an UMTA grant. Section 663.13 provides that this regulation doesnot change the compliance or verification of compliance provisions of theBuy America regulation in 49 CFR Part 661, but is in addition to them.Subpart B sets out the specifics of the pre-award audits. Section 663.21specifies that a pre-award audit must be complete before a recipient entersinto a formal contract to purchase the rolling stock.Section 663.23 explains that a pre-award audit consists of a report withthree separate certifications regarding each of the three items listedin section 319: A safety certification, a Buy America certification, anda purchaser's requirements certification.Section 663.25 describes the safety certification. The safety certificationmust be made by a person who is not an agent or employee of the manufacturerand it must state that the rolling stock the recipient is purchasing hasbeen tested by an independent laboratory and found to comply with all applicableFederal motor vehicle safety standards. In some cases, the National HighwayTraffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) may have tested a vehicle for compliance.If this is so, a certification from NHTSA may be substituted for that ofthe independent laboratory. UMTA recognizes that not all rolling stockwhich would be audited under this part is subject to the Federal motorvehicle safety standards and the regulation provides for certificationof non-applicability. In order to avoid duplication of effort, this sectionalso provides that a laboratory or NHTSA may reissue a safety certificationit issued for one recipient if another recipient is purchasing the samerolling stock. It was of particular concern to Congress that transit agenciesbe able to share this information. (House Report 99-665, p. 74.) This provisionattempts to address that concern.Section 663.27 describes the pre-award Buy America certification. The pre-awardBuy America certification must be made by a person who is not an agentor employee of the manufacturer and it must state that there is a letterfrom UMTA which determines that the rolling stock to be purchased has receiveda waiver under the Buy America requirements or that the person making thecertification is satisfied that the rolling stock to be purchased meetsthe Buy America requirements of 49 CFR Part 661. Before a person can makethis certification, the person must have reviewed documentation providedby the manufacturer as to the cost of the components and subcomponentsof the rolling stock, their country of origin and the location of finalassembly and the activities that will take place at that location. UMTAanticipates that the review required by this section will be performedby an independent contractor in most instances since the information thatmust be reviewed is generally considered proprietary. However, a recipientmay perform the review required by this section if the manufacturer willprovide the recipient with the information necessary.Section 663.29 describes the pre-award purchaser's requirements certification.The pre-award purchaser's requirements certification must be made by aperson who is not an agent or employee of the manufacturer and it muststate that the rolling stock to be purchased meets the purchaser's requirementsas set out in the bid specifications or request for proposals.Subpart C sets out the specifics of a post-delivery audit. Section 663.31specifies the time period for the post-delivery audit. This post-deliveryaudit is in addition to the in-plant inspections which are done throughoutthe manufacturing process.Section 663.33 describes the post-delivery audit, which consists of a post-deliveryBuy America certification and a post-delivery purchaser's requirementscertification. The regulation does not require a post-delivery safety certificationbecause the pre-award safety certification is based on documentation regardingthe particular model purchased. However, the post-delivery purchaser'srequirements certification must be based on visual inspection and operationaltesting of the rolling stock. It is UMTA's position that the pre-awardaudit of safety standards combined with the purchaser's visual inspectionand operational testing should adequately ensure compliance with Federalmotor vehicle safety requirements.Section 663.35 describes the post-delivery Buy America certification. Thepost-delivery Buy America certification must be made by a person who isnot an agent or employee of the manufacturer and, like the pre-award BuyAmerica certification, must state that there is a letter from UMTA whichdetermines that the rolling stock to be purchased has received a waiverunder the Buy America requirements or that the person making the certificationis satisfied that the rolling stock to be purchased meets the Buy Americarequirements of 49 CFR Part 661. Before a person can make this certification,the person must have reviewed documentation provided by the manufactureras to the cost of the components and subcomponents of the rolling stock,their country of origin and the location of final assembly and the activitiesthat took place at that location.Section 663.37 describes the post-delivery purchaser's requirements certification.The post-delivery purchaser's requirements certification must be made bya person who is not an agent or employee of the manufacturer and it muststate that the rolling stock received has been visually inspected and operationallytested and determined to meet the terms of the contract. Visual inspectionwould include verifying design features and could even include lookingat the label on the seats to see if they are marked with their countryof origin and that the country of origin matches the documentation suppliedfor the post-delivery Buy America certification. Operational inspectionwould include making sure the various systems and ancillary equipment allwork at the time of delivery.Section 663.39 prohibits the recipient from finally accepting the rollingstock if it cannot certify that the rolling stock meets applicable BuyAmerica requirements. The section also states that the recipient does nothave to accept the rolling stock if the recipient cannot certify that therolling stock meets the terms of the contract.D. Request for CommentsAccordingly, this notice of proposed rulemaking seeks comment on this proposedregulation requiring pre-award and post-delivery audits of rolling stockpurchases. Because Congress was concerned that this regulation not imposea significant cost burden, UMTA particularly seeks comment on the anticipatedcost of compliance with the proposed regulation, as published today.Commenters wishing acknowledgement of their comments should include a self-addressed,stamped postcard with their comments. The Docket Clerk will stamp the cardwith the date and time the comments are received and return the card tothe commenter.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Regulatory Impacts</ITAG>A. Executive Order 12291This action has been reviewed under Executive Order 12291, and it has beendetermined that it is not a major rule. It will not result in an annualeffect on the economy of $100 million or more.B. Regulatory EvaluationThis regulation is not significant under the Department's Regulatory Policiesand Procedures. UMTA has prepared a preliminary regulatory evaluation insupport of this rulemaking. This preliminary regulatory evaluation is onfile as part of the docket to this rulemaking. A final regulatory evaluationwill be prepared before this proposed rule becomes final.C. Regulatory Flexibility ActIn accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), as added by the Regulatory FlexibilityAct, Pub. L. 96-354, UMTA certifies that this rule will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaningof the Act.D. Paperwork Reduction ActThe collection of information requirements in this rule are subject tothe Paperwork Reduction Act, Pub. L. 96-511, 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35. Section319 of the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Actspecifically requires a grantee to perform pre-award and post-deliveryaudits. These required audits are reflected in this rule and are beingsubmitted to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the Officeof Management and Budget (OMB) for approval.E. Federalism_Executive Order 12612UMTA has reviewed this proposed rule in light of the Federalism considerationsset forth in Executive Order 12612. Although this rule would have definiteFederalism implications because it would impose additional requirementson States, local governments, and public transit operators receiving Federalfinancial assistance from UMTA, this rulemaking is required by statute.UMTA considered the Federalism implications of this rulemaking in formulatingthis proposal, and has designed it to provide recipients with as much flexibilityas possible under the law. UMTA does not expect that this proposed rulewill have a substantial direct effect on the relationship between the FederalGovernment and the States or the distribution of power and responsibilitiesamong the various levels of government. In addition, UMTA has consideredthe Federalism implications of this rulemaking on public transit operatorswhich are quasi-governmental or instrumentalities of States and local governments,and UMTA does not expect that this proposed rule will have a substantialdirect effect on the relationship between those public operators and thegovernmental entities with which they are associated. Accordingly, UMTAhas determined that the preparation of a Federalism Assessment under ExecutiveOrder 12612 is not warranted.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 663</ITAG>Government contracts, Grant programs_transportation, Mass transportation.<ITAG tagnum="84">III.
