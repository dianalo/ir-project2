These managementmeasures were adopted by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council)at its April 4-7 meeting and were submitted to the Secretary for his review,approval, and implementation by regulatory notice. After a full reviewof all the issues, and a determination that the Council's recommended measureswere consistent with the Fishery Management Plan for Ocean Salmon Fisheriesoff the Coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California (FMP), the MagnusonAct, and other applicable law, the Secretary approved and implemented theseason measures effective May 1. The three west coast states also adoptedregulations for their marine waters consistent with the Federal regulations.During Council proceedings, commercial ocean salmon fishermen from Californiaopposed the Council's proposed measures for managing Klamath River fallchinook salmon because of the restrictions these measures would imposeon ocean trolling south and north of the Klamath Management Zone (KMZ).The trollers particularly objected to the season structure (quotas, areas,openings-closings) adopted by the Council because it included extensiveclosures both to the south and north of the KMZ (Orford Reef Red Buoy,Oregon, to Horse Mountain, California) that were considered necessary bythe Council to allow a modest level of fishing within the KMZ. By the endof the Council's April meeting, certain commercial ocean fishermen requestedtotal closure of the KMZ in order to provide maximum fishing opportunityoutside the KMZ. The Council considered this option, but chose to moderateadverse socio-economic impacts on local fishermen in the KMZ by allowingsome fishing time in the zone and spreading closures over a greater areawhile still meeting the spawning escapement rate required by Amendment9 (implemented effective May 1). (It is noted that at its April meeting,the Council considered the option of a one week, coastwide closure duringlate June, but did not adopt it. This option was also one of the proposedmanagement alternatives in preseason documents provided for public commentbefore the meeting.) The season measures implemented May 1 followed the usual procedure requiredby the framework FMP and implementing regulations by inviting public commentsfor 15 days after promulgation. Because of the controversial aspects ofthe Council's management decisions for Klamath fall chinook salmon, theSecretary invited particular comment on this issue. During the comment period, several letters were received from Californiacommercial trollers' representatives requesting a redistribution of salmonfishing opportunity among California ports as a means of reallocating economicbenefits and costs. The proposed redistribution of fishing opportunityinvolved closing commercial salmon fishing for seven days (June 17-23)in the area from Horse Mountain, California, to the U.S.-Mexico borderto eliminate eight days of the scheduled closure set for July 15-28 inthe area from Horse Mountain to Point Arena, California. The trollers statedthat their proposed closure would distribute more fairly the burden ofconserving Klamath River salmon stocks within California and would reducethe economic hardship on small-scale fishermen operating around the northernCalifornia ports of Fort Bragg and Shelter Cove, while still fulfillingthe conservation goals for the Klamath River chinook salmon. The measuressuggested would not, according to the proponents, reduce fishing opportunitiesfor fishermen from Oregon or Washington. The California commenters werealso concerned that the scheduled extended closures in the Fort Bragg/ShelterCove area would result in severe crowding on those fishing grounds to thesouth that will still be open to fishing, as well as posing greater riskto smaller Fort Bragg boats that might attempt to travel to open southernareas during rough sea conditions. The California trollers' representatives estimated that their proposalto redistribute the necessary closures would increase the Fort Bragg/ShelterCove area catch by some 30,400 fish, and that the concurrent (coastwide)closure would reduce shifts in fishing efforts and allow more orderly productflow to markets due to the shorter closed period. NMFS biologists projectedthat an overall catch reduction of nearly 24,000 salmon to California trollerswould result if the adjustment were accepted. The trollers who could beaffected by such a reduction were optimistic that a loss of that magnitudewould not occur, and in any case, were willing to accept the risk of overalllower catches to redress what they perceived as an imbalance within theCalifornia catch distribution.In its comments, a major association of California trollers indicated that,because the Council adopted the final option for the troll industry onlyminutes before adjourning its April meeting, it was unable to review theeconomic impacts of the combined 45 closed days on the area immediatelysouth of the KMZ. Additionally, the association alleges that it was notfully apprised at the Council's April 7 meeting as to the projected Klamathimpacts south of Point Arena. This association indicates that its membershipunanimously supports a 7-day coastwide closure, which would eliminate 8of the scheduled 45 days closed between Horse Mountain and Point Arena,and that this position is consistent with an earlier formal decision ofthe association's board of directors. Letters supporting the California trollers' proposal were received fromseveral Federal and State legislators and from local community officials.Subsequent to its April meeting, the Council was requested by the Californiatrollers to conduct a meeting by telephone conference call to reconsiderthe issue. On April 28, the Council Chairman determined that a majorityof the Council members felt a meeting was unnecessary, and the telephoneconference was therefore not held. The decision not to reconsider thisissue was based on the Council's determination that no new informationhad become available since the April meeting, and that the issue had beensufficiently discussed by the Council and commented on by the public atthat time. The NOAA Assistant Administrator has reviewed all comments received onthe season measures and was impressed that the salmon fishermen from theFort Bragg and Shelter Cove areas presented a case for their proposal thatwas not objected to by fishermen who would be adversely affected by thespecific season changes. The trollers' objections to the Council's decisionsand to the season setting process deserves careful consideration by theagency and by the Council, particularly their belief that substantial improvementsshould be made in the annual procedure used by the Council to resolve userconflicts and to negotiate compromises necessary in allocating limitedsalmon resources. The Council clearly was faced with a very difficult and complex problemin developing the 1989 salmon regulations. Multiple, and to a significantdegree, incompatible management objectives had to be addressed: meetingthe spawning escapement rate required by Amendment 9, satisfying in-riverfisheries' needs, and addressing the social and economic needs of all coastalcommercial and recreational fishermen and associated community businesses.Under these circumstances, necessary and numerous compromises still willnot result in all users being fully accommodated. NOAA Fisheries believesthat the Fishery Management Councils have the responsibility, under theMagnuson Act, for resolving these very difficult issues. Council decisionsregarding fishery allocations or other measures will be supported by theSecretary unless evidence is presented to show that a Council decisionis based on incorrect information, is inconsistent with an approved andimplemented FMP or amendment, is reached in a manner denying the publicreasonable opportunity for input, or violates the national standards forfishery conservation and management, other provisions of the Magnuson Act,or other applicable law. The agency has encouraged the California trollersand coastal communities to work within the Council forum and process toresolve differences as early as possible in the annual season setting process.While the Council was not convinced to adopt the California trollers' suggestedseason change, considerable support was developed for their position whichshould be considered in any subsequent Council action. In considering the California trollers' request, NOAA Fisheries reviewedthe Secretary's authority to modify the Council's season measures. Accordingto the framework FMP, the Secretary is limited to accepting or rejectingin total the Council's preseason recommendations for the annual managementmeasures. If the Secretary rejects the Council's recommendations, the Councilmust be advised of the rejection and its basis as soon as possible so thatit may reconsider its proposal. While this constraint is not a specificpart of the FMP's implementing regulations, it is binding on the Secretaryas an approved requirement of the FMP. The Secretary is able to departfrom the recommendations of the Council without Council consent only byexercising his authority under Sections 304(c) [Secretarial amendment]or 305(e) [Secretarial emergency action] of the Magnuson Act. Any actionpursuant to section 305(e) must be accompanied by a showing that an emergencyexists involving the fishery. While the lengthy closures in the Fort Braggarea represent problems for the small-scale fishermen of this community,the information thus far presented by the Council and the public is insufficientto support a finding that an emergency exists in the fishery. Use of the inseason management provisions at 50 CFR  661.21 (b) and Appendixsection III.B. by the agency in responding to the troller's request wasconsidered. These provisions give the Regional Director the authority tomodify the regulations during the season to meet the Council's managementobjectives under limited circumstances following consultation with theChairman of the Council and the appropriate State Directors of Fisheries.It was concluded that use of the inseason management authority is not appropriatein this case. Neither the Secretary nor his designee, the Regional Director,can take an action during the season which they could not have taken beforethe season without the consent of the Council. To interpret the RegionalDirector's authority otherwise would undermine the clear expression ofCouncil intent to restrict the Secretary's authority without the Council'sconsent to the use of sections 304(c) or 305(e) of the Magnuson Act. Thisprinciple is no less binding during the season than at the beginning ofthe season, before the annual management measures have been approved. For the reasons indicated above, the Council's season measures will remainunchanged in response to the California trollers' request.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: June 9, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
