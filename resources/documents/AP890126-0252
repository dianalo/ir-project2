The results, which ATandamp;T had projected last month, resulted from a$6.72 billion pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter that covers thecost of scrapping outdated equipment and moving, retiring or layingoff 16,000 employees.   ATandamp;T's stock was rock solid after the announcement, unchanged at$30.87{ at midmorning in consolidated New York Stock Exchangetrading.   ``You say, `My gosh, what a huge charge.' But when it's ATandamp;T andit's such a large company, people just brush it off and look aheadto the next quarter. Most companies, it would just wipe them rightout,'' said Audrey Stevoff, an analyst at Duff andamp; Phelps Inc. inChicago.   ATandamp;T has previously said the charge would have no effect on itscash flow, its ability to pay dividends or the money available forinvestment. Revenue in the fourth quarter and the full year setrecords for the period since the 1984 breakup of the Bell System.   ATandamp;T said it had a net loss of $3.34 billion for the three monthsended Dec. 31, compared with profits of $498 million, or 46 cents ashare, a year earlier.

Revenuerose to $35.2 billion from $33.8 billion.   Nynex Corp., one of the companies spun off from ATandamp;T in the 1984breakup, separately reported a 6.1 percent rise in itsfourth-quarter profit.   The charge that resulted in ATandamp;T's historic annual loss came fromspeeding up its program of getting rid of old phone equipment andputting in new digital switches and other equipment that uses thelanguage of computers.   ATandamp;T said the changes would put the company in a better positionto lower long-distance prices and meet the competition. ATandamp;T is in afierce battle for customers, especially big businesses, with MCICommunications Corp. and US Sprint Communications Co.   ``The charge for network modernization, despite its effect onshort-term results, was driven by our determination to continuewinning customers in the marketplace,'' said Robert E. Allen, ATandamp;Tchairman. ``Underlying this action are clear indications that 1988was a year of steady improvement in our operations.''
