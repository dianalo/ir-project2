But officials at the U.S. Embassy in London, the FAA and theWhite House denied a report today in the tabloid Daily Express thatU.S. diplomats and military personnel had been notified of thewarning. They also denied that the warning said the hijacking couldoccur over Easter weekend.   A spokesman for the U.S. European Command, which is in charge ofU.S. military forces in Europe, said it was aware of the warning butdid not pass it along to military personnel. The spokesman, ArmyMaj. Dennis Pinkham, spoke with The Associated Press from Stuttgartand refused to elaborate.   The front-page Daily Express report came during a politicaldebate in Britain over whether airlines were properly informed abouta radio-cassette bomb before Pan Am Flight 103, a Boeing 747 boundfor New York, was blown apart over Lockerbie in Scotland, Dec. 21,killing 270 people.   Airports in England, Italy, Belgium and West Germany stepped upsecurity after receiving the warning, but no additional precautionswere reported today at airports in the Netherlands, Greece or Spain.   The White House press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, said today thewarning was issued March 16 and that it was ``similar to many, manysimilar kinds of information and security bulletins that go out.''   Fitzwater said in Washington that ``it was not given to anymilitary or diplomatic personnel but rather just to security expertsat aviation airports and airlines.'' The notice did not mention anyspecific time period, such as Easter, Fitzwater said, nor did itmention a specific airline or airport.   The FAA said in a statement in Washington that the securitybulletin was issued to provide information to air carriers andairports about ``the possibility of a hijacking of a U.S. airlinerin Western Europe.'' The FAA said the bulletin was sensitiveinformation not designed for public distribution.   ``The release of this information by unauthorized persons can becounterproductive to the civil aviation community's efforts toprovide a totally effective security system,'' the FAA said.   The FAA said the bulletin did not refer to a time period or namean airline or airport, nor was there any reference to the EasternHoliday period. It said no warning was issued to U.S. governmentemployees.   Richard Calder, a spokesman at the embassy press office inLondon, said the FAA office in London passed on the warning toBritain's Department of Transport and to U.S. carriers in Britain.   In Bonn today, officials said the West German Interior Ministryand U.S. government offices were notified of a threatened terroristattack but that they did not issue a warning to the public. Flight103 originated in West Germany.   An Interior Ministry spokesman, Roland Bachmeier, said Bonnauthorities received ``a vague warning'' that a hijack threat hadbeen made, but declined to give any details of the threat or how itwas received.   In another development, Independent Television News today showedvideotape taken by three youths who said they were able to board anempty British Airways jumbo jet at Heathrow on Monday without beingchallenged. The video included a shot of one youth sitting in thecaptain's seat in the cockpit.   ``They say they are cracking down on security and they areconfident no one else can do what happened at Lockerbie,'' said oneof the youths, identified only as Shoaib Khan. ``It is just nottrue.''   British Airways said in a statement it regarded the incident as``extremely serious'' and was investigating.   The London tabloid the Daily Express said the possible hijackthreat was detailed in a secret memorandum dated March 17 from theFAA. The paper said it had been given a copy of the memorandum.   Britain's Department of Transport said in a statement: ``We don'tdiscuss security matters.''   The Daily Express said:   ``American military personnel and diplomats and their familieshave been told of the threat, which centers on U.S. airlines. Theywere advised to alter routine plans to return home from Europe forEaster.''   The Daily Express said the FAA memo ``warns all airlines andsecurity forces in the U.S., Britain and the rest of Europe. It waspassed to the Department of Transport in London'' It quotes``security sources'' as saying a copy of the memo arrived at theLondon offices of International Aviation Security, a company ownedby Trans World Airlines.''   The Daily Express printed part of the memorandum, which read inpart:   ``Possible: 3 Lebanese Palestinians may try to hijack a U.S.airliner in Europe. Possible names: Jamel Hahmud Talid Muhammed:Ahmed Muhammad Salim Abuzayni: Khalour Muhammed Jafar.   ``Alias passports: Bahrain, Pakistan, North Yemen, possiblegenuine@forged or altered.   ``Above information credible although not confirmed.'</TEXT></DOC>
