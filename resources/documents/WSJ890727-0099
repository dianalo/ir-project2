Although many of those testifying said they felt they were victims of isolated retaliation, most said changes are necessary in the IRS's internal-security system to ensure that employee misconduct is uncovered and corrected.    &quot;I have seen instances of preferred treatment for senior officials of the IRS and a coerced resignation of an employee who had uncovered malfeasance by a senior management official,&quot; said Stanley Shirai, a special agent in the IRS's Los Angeles office who investigates income-tax evasion.    The employees testified on the second day of hearings by the Commerce, Consumer and Monetary Affairs Subcommittee into ethical conduct and standards at the IRS. The hearings, which follow a year-long investigation by the panel, focused on eight cases of alleged wrongdoing by 25 senior IRS officials, including taking gratuities from a businessman while providing him with confidential tax information and improperly intervening in a Justice Department tax investigation. Committee investigators say they have turned up at least 25 more incidents of what they regard as serious misconduct.    The subcommittee has been paying particular attention to how the IRS investigated the employees once the allegations came to light and whether it disciplined them appropriately.    In one case, three former employees and one current employee in the IRS's Los Angeles office said there was a perception in the office that an inspection supervisor -- responsible for examining charges of employee misconduct -- was too close to the people she was supposed to be investigating. One employee who complained that the perception was discouraging witnesses from talking about one case was told by Washington that headquarters officials had decided against taking her off the case.    The subcommittee also heard from three employees who in 1984 told a regional inspector that their supervisor had been providing confidential tax information to a Chicago businessman, accepting theater tickets and other gifts from the businessman, and otherwise violating agency rules.    Two of the employees, Stanley Welli and Ronald Koperniak, said they were snubbed after the incident and eventually demoted. They have since been restored to their positions, after appealing to higher IRS officials. The third, George Ecola, said he was ordered to transfer to another city. After he refused to move &quot;because it was retaliation,&quot; his superiors withdrew their order. But he said he stopped receiving merit pay increases, and that in 1985, for the first time in 22 years of service, his performance rating was less than &quot;above average.&quot;    Mr. Koperniak said a regional inspector said to the three employees: &quot;The organization will get you.&quot;    An IRS spokeswoman said, &quot;Our basic longstanding policy is all employees have an obligation to report wrongdoing they see. And the corollary to that is you have to feel confident you can report it, and it will be investigated properly, and not have any fear you will be retaliated against.&quot;    The subcommittee may seek to have the IRS's internal inspection operations put under a special inspector general's office answering only to the IRS commissioner. It might also seek to transfer some inspection functions to the Treasury Department's inspector general. Though the IRS is part of Treasury, the Treasury inspector general's office normally only reviews IRS cases; it isn't actively involved in them. </TEXT></DOC>
