The Soviet Union now meets allof its international human rights obligations, he added.</LP><TEXT>   Though it doesn't take effect until 1993, the new lawcould be crucial to the Soviet Union's bid for Western andespecially U.S. financial aid. With the Soviet economycontinuing to deteriorate -- overall production fell 8% inthe first quarter -- Moscow recently asked the U.S. for $1.5billion in export credits for U.S. grain under a specialwaiver of the Jackson-Vanik amendment. The amendment linksthe granting of export credits and most-favored-nation tradestatus to increased emigration.   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman MargaretTutwiler called the new Soviet law a &quot;positive development,&quot;though the U.S. would have preferred that it be implementedsooner. She wouldn't predict if the action would result inthe U.S. granting most-favored-nation trading status toMoscow, saying the department hadn't seen details of thelegislation.   But other U.S. officials said the Bush administration islikely to grant such status to the Soviets, though notimmediately.   The need for a quick infusion of cash could be a reasonwhy conservative opposition to the bill collapsed in the faceof what deputies say was last-minute lobbying by Sovietleader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. One official close to Mr.Gorbachev said the possibility of Western aid played a role.&quot;The need for credits isn't the main reason for the law'spassage, but is closely connected to it,&quot; he said.   But Mr. Gorbachev's position wasn't taken without proddingby Western leaders. Mr. Burlatsky said the Soviet presidentoriginally leaned toward urging deputies to delay the bill,fearing a brain drain and high costs associated with the newlaw. But Mr. Gorbachev changed his mind after President Bushand French President Francois Mitterrand urged him to supportit. &quot;The president's position was taken not without theinfluence of Bush and Mitterrand,&quot; Mr. Burlatsky said.   Under the new law, authorities must rule within one orthree months, respectively, on requests for an internationalpassport to travel or to emigrate. The procedure has beenpainstakingly involved and often fruitless. People have theright to contest a refusal in court. A version of theemigration bill that would have gone into effect in mid-1992failed in a parliamentary vote last week amid heated debateover its economic costs. In a second vote yesterday themeasure passed, but with implementation delayed until Jan. 1,1993.   The reason for the delay, lawmakers said, is the need toorganize transportation, customs and other services necessaryto handle the expected flood of entries and exits. Othershope that in the 19 months until the law is enacted thecountry can implement economic reforms that will persuadesome would-be emigrants to change their minds.   Many young professionals who could earn considerably moreabroad are undecided. &quot;I'm afraid I'd be a second-classcitizen in the West,&quot; said one researcher in MoscowUniversity's chemistry department.   When Soviet leaders began allowing increasing numbers ofcitizens to emigrate last year 452,000 people left the SovietUnion, chiefly Jews, Armenians, and Germans -- they expectedto receive most-favored-nation status, which reduces tariffson recipient's exports to the U.S. Instead, in 1989 the U.S.Congress added another requirement to the Jackson-Vanikamendment -- that a formal law on free emigration must beadopted before the Soviet Union could receive extensivecredits.   The State Labor and Social Affairs Committee estimatesthat two million Soviet citizens are ready to go abroad insearch of jobs, but only between 2.5 million and sevenmillion Soviets can find foreign work during the next decade.Roughly 500,000 will be emigrating annually, the committeeestimates.   The Soviets will continue to lose top scientists and otherprofessionals, but this should be offset by hard currencyremittances from workers abroad. Officials also hope thatfree movement will bring in Western technology and spurcompetition.   But as the Soviet Union lets down its barriers, the Westis erecting new ones. U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock recentlytold the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda that free entry and exitfrom one's country is a right, but entry into another countryis &quot;a privilege.&quot; Currently, the U.S. accepts as many as50,000 Soviet immigrants a year.</TEXT></DOC>
