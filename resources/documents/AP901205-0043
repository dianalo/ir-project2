The left-leaning Social Democrats are a party without aplatform. They are crippled by internal divisions and desperatelyseeking a new leader of the caliber of senior party member WillyBrandt, the former chancellor.   Lafontaine said Tuesday that he is too busy as governor ofSaarland state to assume the chairmanship.   But he also complained about the half-hearted support hiscampaign received among some Social Democrats before Sunday'selection.   ``It is impossible to conduct an election campaign withoutsolidarity,'' Lafontaine said Tuesday..   Lafontaine refused to fully embrace German unity during thecampaign.   The resulting damage was especially severe in what had been EastGermany, where the party captured just 25 percent of the vote.Social Democrats are now viewed by many there as political pariahs.   Lafontaine, 47, spent most of his campaign warning against thepitfalls of unification, rather than proposing how unity's problems- like high unemployment in the eastern lands - can be solved.   ``The SPD should wholeheartedly say that unification is apositive development,'' said Renate Koecher, a researcher at theAllensbach polling institute.   ``Secondly, they should see the new German states (East Germany)as new turf where they have to be intensively engaged.''   The party lost a half-million votes to Kohl's ChristianDemocrats in the opposition party's worst electoral showing since1957. It was the Social Democrats' third defeat by Kohl since hecame to power eight years ago.   Kohl's grasp on Germany's leadership is already being comparedto that of Konrad Adenauer, West Germany's first chancellor, whoheld office for 14 years.   ``It really is now a fairly unbalanced political system, with avery strong predominance of the government parties,'' said PeterPulzer, an Oxford University Germany specialist who observed theelections.   The governing parties, led by the Christian Democrats, alsoinclude the Christian Social Union and Free Democrats.   It took Brandt finally to dislodge Adenauer's ChristianDemocrats in 1969. The Social Democrats are now hunting for aleader who can do the same to Kohl.   Brandt, 76, is the Social Democrats' most popular member and isrespected throughout the party.   ``The party leadership needs rejuvenation,'' said nationalchairman Hans-Jochen Vogel, who on Tuesday announced plans to stepdown.   Possible candidates for the top party job include Johannes Rau,Walter Momper and Bjoern Engholm.   Rau, 59, is the popular governor of North Rhine-Westphalia, buthe lost heavily to Kohl in the 1987 chancellor race.   Momper, the 45-year-old former mayor of Berlin, had been seen asa rising star within the Social Democrats' ranks, but he lost inBerlin city elections on Sunday.   Engholm, the 51-year-old governor of Schleswig-Holstein state,is a dapper, pipe-smoking intellectual popular in his home state.   One of the Social Democrats' best orators - 47-year-old HertaDaeubler-Gmelin - has also been mentioned for the job.</TEXT></DOC>
