Planners believe that U.S. and allied pilots flying asmany as 2,000 missions a day can lay waste to much of Iraq'sessential infrastructure and cripple its forces in theKuwaiti desert.</LP><TEXT>   U.S. spy satellites passing silently thousands of milesoverhead will assess the damage on an almost hourly basis.The data they beam down will quickly be analyzed and passedback to military targeters, who would then send the pilots ontheir next missions. The pilots are using &quot;smart weapons,&quot;precision-guided missiles and bombs, that will home in on thetroublesome targets that remain, probably including thebunker of Saddam Hussein. The U.S. will also usesophisticated electronic jamming technology to try to stallIraqi weapons and communications.   When units of the 690,000 U.S. and allied troops in theGulf region are ordered into the fray, they are expected totry to punch through or outflank Iraqi lines in a blitzlikemovement. The ground assault will be spearheaded by the M-1A1tank, which can go more than 40 miles an hour while firing120mm guns that analysts think can penetrate the armor ofIraq's Soviet-made tanks. Heavy waves of &quot;softening up&quot;bombing from B-52s will ease the way for the ground effort.   If such a war goes according to plan, it ends in as littleas two weeks. But that is when additional troubles couldbegin: There has been much planning for this war, but littleopen discussion about how it might end, and how a safestability might be grafted onto the bloody stump of theremaining Iraqi forces and given to the nation'slong-suffering citizenry.   This war pits the new maneuver-style fighting doctrines ofthe Army and the Marine Corps against an enemy that wastrained and equipped by the Red Army of the Brezhnev era. Andit pits electronic sophistication and agility against anentrenched, centrally controlled force accustomed to fightingdefensive battles behind armor, artillery and theshock-absorbing capacity of sand.   &quot;You couldn't pick a better enemy to fight than Iraq,&quot;says Edward C. Meyer, a former Army chief of staff who helpeddevelop the Army's basic fighting doctrine, known as AirlandBattle. &quot;Iraq is essentially a Soviet-style force. It usesSoviet doctrine. Our people are going to go into battlefeeling very confident.&quot;   Joshua M. Epstein, a military analyst at the BrookingsInstitution and an authority on computerized war gaming,calculates that there are 1,343 targets, mostly inside Iraq,that are important enough to be attacked by U.S. bombers inthe first four to six days of war. These include bridges,radars, communication sites, rocket launchers, air bases,dams, power plants and Iraq's nuclear, chemical andbiological weapons-related sites.   The bitter lessons of the Vietnam War, condensed andtaught in Army war colleges since the early 1980s, hold thatthe combined air-ground attack, synchronized and waged deeplyinto enemy territory, is the most potent force.   Among the major hidden enemies of such an intenselychoreographed attack, the most potent may be Murphy's Law,the World War II dictum that holds, &quot;Whatever can go wrong,will.&quot;   There is particular concern over the U.S. arsenal ofhigh-technology weapons, which, in addition to the Apachehelicopter, include the Air Force's new air-to-air Amraammissile, designed to find, track and kill enemy aircraft fromas far as 40 miles away; and the Navy's sea-launched cruisemissile, the Tomahawk, designed to follow the contours of theearth and detect and blow up specific buildings 300 miles ormore distant from the launch site. Most of these weaponshaven't been used in battle before.   Murphy's Law certainly could apply in the Gulf, butmitigating it will be the amount of time the U.S. militaryhas had to prepare for this confrontation.   The generals and the admirals have had six months toposition their units and ready their weaponry -- an unusualluxury compared with the havoc, mistakes and slaughter thatattended the first American units injected into combat inNorth Africa in World War II, and into Korea and Vietnam.   Among the most delicate and dangerous maneuvers that musttake place before the ground attack begins is one called&quot;passage of lines,&quot; the advance of U.S. armored units thatwould spearhead the attack, through the Saudi and other Arabarmies that have arrayed themselves along the Kuwait-Iraqborder. The danger is that they will shoot at each other.   &quot;Passage is difficult during the day between armies thatspeak the same language,&quot; explains one Army official. &quot;We mayhave to attempt this at night.&quot;   U.S. Special Forces units, paratroops and helicopter-bornecavalry and Marine units will probably be raising havocbehind enemy lines as Iraqi commanders weigh the problem ofwhat to do with their remaining reserves. A large Marineamphibious force that has moved into the Gulf will force themto keep as many as 100,000 troops guarding their beaches.   Another threat is the possibility that U.S., British andArab armored forces will attempt to punch through or outflankIraqi forces from the west, moving rapidly over thepebble-flecked, hard-packed desert near the border where abus or a jeep can move at 60 mph.   According to Pete Williams, the Pentagon's spokesman, itis the flanking attack that appears to worry Iraqi commandersthe most. The major change in Iraqi lines during the last fewweeks, he says, is a &quot;westward expansion&quot; of Iraq's elaboratedefenses, including high, protective mounds of sand.   Using computer-generated models, Mr. Epstein of theBrookings Institution estimates 3,300 U.S. casualties with1,049 dead as his best-case scenario, with war lasting onlytwo weeks. If the war goes more slowly and the U.S. makeserrors, his worst case is 16,059 U.S. casualties, with 4,136dead.   But Mr. Epstein believes even under this scenario the warwill only last three weeks. Other analysts say the worst casewould be a war lasting several months and involving thousandsmore U.S. deaths. Some believe that Iraqi losses couldoutnumber U.S. casualties by as much as 20 to 30 to one.</TEXT></DOC>
