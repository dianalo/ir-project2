The oil industry rightly objects to hisrestrictions on their merits, but we suspect he got thepolitics of the situation pretty near right. Given thepsuedo-environmentalist ethic now in force, little newcoastal extraction was to be expected soon in any case. Ofcourse, White House leadership on difficult issues iswelcome, but the greater responsibility in this case lieswith Congressmen and state officials, including conservativeRepublicans, who formed a near-solid wall of opposition todrilling; with judges, who've demonstrated hair-triggersensitivity to anti-drilling lawsuits; and with that segmentof the public that wants cheap gasoline but is intolerant ofthe hazards of either tankers or less risky drillingplatforms off the coast. In time, as oil grows dearer, thematter may become riper for rational choices.</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
