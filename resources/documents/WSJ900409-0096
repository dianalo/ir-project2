As a black South African, Mr. Mandela wanted to be hereyesterday, one of 20,000 burying the latest group of blackmartyrs killed by the South African police. But as the deputypresident of the African National Congress, he found himselfon a plane heading to Lusaka, Zambia, to brief theorganization's exile leadership on his recent talks with theSouth African government. His body was there, but his heartwas here. After 27 years in prison, he wants to follow hispeople, to be part of them. But he knows he must also lead.</LP><TEXT>   Such is the dilemma of Mr. Mandela as he walks the thinline between talks with the government and solidarity withhis people. While trying to unify the country's blackmajority, which has been systematically divided by the whitegovernment over the decades, Mr. Mandela is battling to catchup and move forward at the same time. Wherever he goes in thecountry, he finds himself having to balance black emotionsover the past with black aspirations for the future.   Sebokeng, a vast gathering of shacks south of Johannesburgthat has often been a flashpoint of conflict and a target ofrepression, provided his first true test, when, on March 26,police opened fire on residents marching to protest highrents and poor living conditions. Several blacks were killedimmediately (the death toll is now 17, according to communityleaders) and hundreds were injured. The ANC leadershipexpressed outrage at the shootings, but initially said thetragedy shouldn't derail the opening of ANC-government talksset for April 11. But when Mr. Mandela and other leadersvisited the injured and the families of the dead, there wasno mistaking the community's anger at the police andgovernment. Mr. Mandela and the ANC announced a suspension ofthe talks.   Although the decision seemed to highlight divisions withinthe ANC -- between Mr. Mandela and others anxious to beginpower-sharing talks with the government and hard-linersopposed to negotiations -- and subjected the ANC to muchinternational criticism, Mr. Mandela and his colleaguesreally had no choice.   &quot;For the ANC leaders to go on talking with the governmentwhile ANC members are being killed by the police would havegiven a very negative impression to our people,&quot; says MichaelMile, a young ANC supporter who has come to mourn his fallenfriends. &quot;To talk while the killing goes on would have shownno unity at all.&quot;   While the suspension of talks may have left the ANClooking in disarray, the Sebokeng shootings actually servedto crystallize both the organization's strategy and Mr.Mandela's stature in the black community. The ANC is nowtelling other black groups and leaders inside the countrythat the time has come to choose between it and thegovernment, between those who were shot and those who did theshooting.   &quot;There is no longer room for anyone to be neutral,&quot; ANCleader Walter Sisulu said at yesterday's funeral. &quot;Either youare with the regime or you are with us.&quot;   After pulling out of this week's scheduled talks withPretoria, Mr. Mandela began working to isolate thegovernment. He spoke with the leaders of six black homelandswho were to meet with the government last week, and four ofthem agreed to back out of their talks. Also, the ANC haspersuaded a host of black town councilors around the countryto resign, or pledge to work for the end of the municipalgovernment structures. The government, which accuses the ANCof intimidation tactics, had been fervently hoping that thehomeland leaders and black councilors -- its allies inadministering the country's segregated political structure --would be on its side in future power-sharing negotiations.   Following these moves, Mr. Mandela met with President F.W.de Klerk for three hours late last week and agreed toreschedule the ANC-government talks for May 2-4. He alsopressed Mr. de Klerk into opening a judicial inquiry into whythe police opened fire in Sebokeng.   &quot;We see that Mandela did raise the grievances of thepeople,&quot; says Benjamin Hlanyane, one of yesterday's mourners.&quot;The people now understand that the ANC does represent them.&quot;   Still, the ANC has its opponents. Its bitter differenceswith Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who heads the KwaZuluhomeland, have widened in recent weeks as the fightingbetween his supporters and ANC sympathizers in Natal Provinceintensifies. And the Pan African Congress, which advocates ablack takeover of power and is opposed to negotiations withthe government, accuses the ANC of selling out blacks. OnSaturday, Mr. Mandela met with supporters of the PAC, and thetwo groups issued a joint statement saying, &quot;Unity in actionand peace among our people require urgent resolution.&quot;   But in burying its dead yesterday, the ANC resurrected itsdream of black unity. &quot;There are only two roads to take, thegovernment or the people,&quot; shouted Mr. Sisulu. &quot;It is time tostand united . . . to follow the road traveled by the peoplewe bury today.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
