However, sufficient study has not yet been made about the detailsof the experimental method, therefore, the following conditions weretemporarily set. Only electrons are detected at the final state of neutrondecay. The identification of electrons in the neutron decay reactionis carried out by distinguishing it as the event allowable in a phasespace. For the purpose, as the performance required for the detectors,the range of energy measurement is 100 - 800 keV, and the energy resolutionis not more than 50 keV. The space of the decay region that the detectorscover is not larger than the cross section 15 x 15 cm/sup 2/ and thelength 30 cm. A magnetic field is added. Under these conditions, thepractically conceivable electron detectors are the following three types,that is gas amplification type chamber, plastic scintillation counterand silicon semiconductor detector. The silicon semiconductor detectorsare practically usable as the detectors for this experiment, accordingto the investigation by the authors on the general matters, the materialand the method of making the detectors. The plastic scintillation countersand the silicon semiconductor detectors are to be examined without makingthe final selection. (Kako, I.).</TEXT></DOC>
