By buying directly into the offshore drilling venture, the universities plan to benefit from depressed exploration costs and, they hope, from any future rebound in the price of natural gas. They also are taking advantage of another new trend in the oil business: the growing ability of small independent oil companies to gain valuable exploration acreage in the Gulf of Mexico that major oil companies previously kept for themselves.    The operator of the venture is Brooklyn Union Exploration Co., the Houston-based exploration unit of Brooklyn Union Gas Co., a New York-based gas utility, whose own investment could range from $100 million to $145 million. The institutional investors are participating through a $145 million financing of Brooklyn Union's 50% partner, Smith Offshore Exploration Co., a closely held independent oil company based in Houston.    While current natural gas prices are far below their peaks of a few years ago, many analysts expect the price to rise over the next several years as the current surplus of gas supplies dwindles. Most figure that the U.S. is using at least twice as much natural gas as oil companies are finding through their reduced exploration programs.    James Floyd, president of Brooklyn Union Exploration, said he is aiming at prospects that will be profitable at current depressed prices and even more lucrative if gas prices rebound. While few analysts agree on the timing of a turnaround in gas prices, &quot;There aren't many people who project that energy prices are going to be lower than they are today,&quot; Mr. Floyd said.    Although any such exploration venture includes the near-certainty of drilling at least a few dry holes, the investors say the overall program could produce significant profits as natural gas is sold over the next dozen years. &quot;You can lose 100% of your money on a given well, but you can make 20,000% on another one,&quot; notes Scott Sperling, a partner in Harvard Management Co., which has committed $50 million to the venture. By spreading the risk of the three-year drilling program over many wells, Mr. Sperling said, Harvard is &quot;shooting for substantially in excess&quot; of a 35% annual rate of return.    Other investors, whose commitments are far smaller than Harvard's, include Yale University, Duke University, the University of North Carolina, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Pension Reserves Investment Trust and Wellesley College.    Because oil companies are hard-pressed to scrape up outside financing from traditional sources, new investors such as Harvard and the others have a rare chance to participate in oil patch transactions once reserved for insiders, Mr. Sperling noted. &quot;The saying used to be that by the time a deal got to Boston it wasn't worth investing in,&quot; he said.    Lester Smith, president of Smith Offshore, said that when he first raised the possibility of seeking funds from Eastern universities, &quot;I thought they were going to revoke my membership in the Petroleum Club.&quot; But, he noted, while the oil patch was awash in investment capital a few years ago, &quot;today there are too many deals chasing too few dollars.&quot;    Brooklyn Union Exploration and Smith are just two of the several Houston independent oil companies that are raising money to drill wells in the Gulf of Mexico on acreage leased by large independents and major oil companies during the early 1980s.    As the big oil companies cut back on their own drilling plans, they are increasingly allowing smaller oil companies to drill on their hundreds of unexplored tracts; in return, the major companies receive a percentage of any future revenue. Current owners of the tracts must either begin exploration within the next few years or surrender thousands of unexplored tracts to the federal government. By allowing others to drill, the owners avoid giving up hundreds of millions of dollars of original lease payments. </TEXT></DOC>
