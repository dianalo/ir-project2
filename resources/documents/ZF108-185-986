(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Spinning Systems In the PacificandM;Silk spun in Thailand is noted for its elegant designs and enduringqualities.andP;  Costumes made from this rich silk enhance the performance ofancient Thai dances.andP;  Similarly, Rohm and Haas Co.'s IS staff has woventogether systems from IBM, MCI Communications Corp. and Soft-Switch Inc. tocreate a distinct electronic fabric that's enhancing our company's businessperformance in the Asia-Pacific region.andM;This set of systems, which forms a thread linking Bangkok and a dozen otherPacific locations to critical corporate information, is tailored to meet therequirements of Rohm and Haas, a $ 2.5 billion Philadelphia-based chemicalmanufacturer with worldwide operations.andM;From the air, the cities of the Asia-Pacific region, with their toweringskylines and sophisticated road systems, suggest a Western philosophy ofcommerce.andP;  But Chinese, Indonesian, Korean and other Far Eastern cultureshave their own distinct attitudes toward business and information.andP;  Theseattitudes, along with the region's numerous languages, immense distances anddivergences in deeply held beliefs about social organizations pose challengesto Rohm and Haas as it seeks to expand its business in the Pacific Rim.andM;Helping the company in its Pacific push is information technology.andP;  Overall,information systems at Rohm and Haas facilitate the manufacturing ofspecialty chemicals and their distribution.andP;  An IBM 3090-600 installed at ourPhiladelphia headquarters runs both MVS and VM operating systems.andP;  The 3090tracks a good share of worldwide sales, delivers various database andanalytical services and provides IBM PROFS electronic mail services.andO;Complementary services are provided by midrange IBM S/3Xs and AS/400s and byDigital Equipment Corp. VAXs.andM;The information systems serving our Pacific operations, although consistentwith the systems in the rest of the Company, have been targeted to meet theparticular requirements of the region.andP;  While business in this area has beensteadily increasing, it still represents only about 10% of Rohm and Haas'total volume.andM;Two ObjectivesandM;There are two primary objectives governing our systems plans in theAsia-Pacific region: to provide systems that are tightly integrated andfacilitate the company's global business initiatives and to satisfy the needsof the various Pacific Rim cultures.andM;We've  taken actions to satisfy these objectives, recognizing that littleguidance exists for this type of systems implementation in Asia-Pacific.andP;  Thefirst step we've taken is to augment our PROFS e-mail system with the IBMSystem/36-based Personal Services/36 and with the public MCI Mail network.andO;Both services deliver basic text communications to about 90% of ourAsia-Pacific locations.andP;  Although business in the region is normallyconducted in the native language, Rohm and Haas professionals at alllocations understand English and can thus use e-mail.andM;Second, we've begun implementing associated services built upon this e-mailfoundation.andP;  These include directory, database, order-processing and networkservices.andM;The heart of all of our systems in the Asia-Pacific region is the IBM3090-based electronic mail software.andP;  We use Soft-Switch software that runsunder both MVS and VM, as well as with IBM's Distributed Office SupportSystem (DISOSS) to provide communications protocol conversions.andP;  This enablesus to tie together three systems that do not exchange e-mail in their nativeforms: PROFS, MCI Mail and Personal Services/36.andM;On the surface, it may have seemed easier simply to extend our widely usedPROFS system to the Asia-Pacific.andP;  However, the cost of using PROFS (eitherthrough remote emulation or by adding small System/370 nodes) in the Pacificwould have been excessively high.andM;Using both MCI and Personal Services/36 allowed us to tailor systems thatwere low cost and easy to use.andP;  Since access to MCI requires only a PC and amodem, our smaller offices that can't justify a midrange system can still belinked into the e-mail network via their PCs.andM;Personal Services/36 is an incremental application on our existingSystem/36s.andP;  Therefore, we didn't need to purchase any new hardware toimplement the service.andP;  And we expect a smooth migration to AS/400s over thenext few years.andM;While the AS/400s will provide essential database and networking facilitiesfor the future, directory services for our Pacific region e-mail users aremandatory today.andP;  Rohm and Haas has built an on-line directory into PROFSthat permits simple lookup services by last name.andP;  This directory isregenerated daily in a process that combines a variety of personnel files.andO;The PROFS directory for the Asia-Pacific area includes the name, user ID andthe node of our MCI and System/36 users.andP;  This complete list is available online only in PROFS; we distribute a hard copy of the directory to our Pacificlocations.andM;The directory problem is in reality a distributed database problem.andP;  It's notyet clear how we'll provide on-line directory access from all nodes or how wewill ensure that all nodal directories are synchronized.andP;  We also are notsure yet how we will provide flexible searching capabilities that will, forexample, allow us to locate all of our export managers worldwide.andP;  We expectthat in the long term we'll use a combination of systems from third partiesand from IBM, perhaps software that integrates DB/2, AS/400 and OS/2 databasefacilities.andM;Creating robust directory services is admittedly a tough problem.andP;  Incontrast, properly implemented database systems currently offer the promiseof streamlining work flow and providing rapid access to accurate information.andO;We've identifield several classes of database systems for use in ourAsia-Pacific region and have already begun delivering a broad range ofservices.andP;  The most common type of database system holds transaction andbusiness information.andP;  These data help Rohm and Haas track such essentialinformation as inventory, sales and shipments.andM;Text databases are another class of stored information that's useful in Rohmand Haas' wordlwide chemical business.andP;  We use text databases to store basicproduct research studies, sales call reports and industry publications ofinterest.andP;  Both full-text and index-searching capabilities for these textdatabases are being developed.andM;The Infancy of Order ProcessingandM;The technical challenge associated with database services is to determinewhere the data should be stored and how it should be accessed.andP;  Rohm and Haasis striving to provide its peripatetic staff members with effective access toinformation.andP;  No vendor, however, yet offers an ideal solution that works inharmony across our workstation, local area network, midrange and System/370platforms.andM;We're now planning to provide various types of database information to ourmanagers and analysts in the Asia-Pacific region through e-mail.andP;  Soft-Switchwill provide improved access to information by offering applicationprogramming interfaces, which will allow us to more tightly link databases toe-mail services.andM;In contrast to the other services described, order-processing services arestill in their infancy in our Pacific region.andP;  We're currently relying ontraditional data-processing systems at plant locations to store order,inventory and billing information.andP;  And we're starting to use e-mail to placeorders for products imported to the Asia-Pacific from our European and NorthAmerican plants.andP;  In addition, we have established a few electronic links tofreight carriers, banks and other organizations.andM;But the real payoff in terms of order processing will come fromintegration--of both our internal order-handling systems and our customers'and suppliers' systems.andP;  With true integration, we'll be able to expediteprocessing, reduce errors and collect meaningful data for future analyses.andM;Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) standards promise to simplify ourintegration efforts.andP;  These standards will allow us to write EDI-basedinterfaces to our existing order and inventtory systems.andM;The final category of services being set up in our Pacific region is networkservices.andP;  We feel that it's essential to build an understanding among ourPacific users of the data transport services we're using to deliver vitalinformation to them.andM;We're currently supplying packet-switched services to about half of ourlocations in the Pacific.andP;  By the end of this year, we expect to complete theimplementation of these services for all locations.andP;  MCI has provided a greatdeal of assistance with this implementation for PCs, eliminating the need forus to evaluate and select carriers in distant countries.andM;The Importance of NetworksandM;Providing packet-switch connectivity for our IBM System/36 installations hasbeen a more difficult task.andP;  We've been working with the public telephonecarriers in the Pacific to establish packet services to our 3090.andP;  And we'vealso had our systems-programming analysts at work fine-tuning ourcommunications setup.andP;  In addition, we've installed IBM's Network PacketSwitch Interface (NPSI) software on our 37xx communications controllers toprovide midrange packet-switch connectivity.andM;In the Pacific, Rohm and Haas is pursuing two information systems paths.andP;  Onthe first path, we've chosen to deliver current functionality to users andvalue to our business by developing automated e-mail, directory, database,order-processing systems and network service.andM;Along the second path, we're creating a foundation that will eventually leadto systems built upon emerging and de facto standards.andP;  In time, we'll beimplementing the X.400 international standard for e-mail and IBM's structuredquery language fordatabase access.andP;  In the meantime, we're managing userexpectations by pacing the delivery of future functions.andM;From a technical standpoint, we're forced by economics to face thecomplexities of a distributed systems world.andP;  But the challenge inAsia-Pacific runs even deeper.andM;In our experience, cost/benefit analyses are often not persuasive proof ofthe merit of new systems implementations in areas such as Japan, wheremaintenance of harmony transcends other considerations.andP;  In Asian cultures,systems such as e-mail, which are characterized by a straightforward flow ofinformation, generally gain acceptance fairly easily.andP;  But significantlyharder to promote in Asia are systems with more abstract information flows.andM;In order to implement systems in Asia-Pacific, we must address issues andconcerns that are specific to the region.andP;  One major problem is thecomplexity of the languages in that part of the world.andP;  Chinese, Korean andJapanese character sets pose major hurdles hindering creation of usablesystems.andP;  Systems security is also crucial since Asian concerns aboutsecurity and privacy extend beyond those of most Western cultures.andP;  Also,individual roles have deep roots in Asian societies and must be givenconsideration if a systems implementation is to be successful.andM;The five systems services--e-mail, directory, database, order-processing andnetwork services--that we are implementing in the Asia-Pacific region areallowing Rohm and Haas to collect accurate data and to perform deeperanalyses.andP;  The benefits of timely data and soldi information are madepossible by systems integration--the intricate electronic fabric woven bynetwork analysts, applications developers and third parties.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
