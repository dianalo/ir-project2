And the fight says a lot about Western intellectual-property disputes with Japan.    Earlier this year, Fusion Systems Corp. of Rockville, Md., made waves by publicly accusing Mitsubishi Electric Corp. of copying a sophisticated Fusion microwave lamp. Fusion charged that Mitsubishi then applied for hundreds of &quot;knock-off&quot; patents that threaten the U.S. company's use of its own technology in Japan.    Now Fusion says Mitsubishi is dragging its feet on resolving the four-year patent dispute. When Fusion President Donald Spero visited Tokyo last week, Mitsubishi executives refused to meet with him. Says Mr. Spero: &quot;It seems obvious they have no intention of reaching a settlement.&quot;    Mitsubishi says Fusion is trying to extort concessions by cozying up to the American government and the media. Fusion's claims are &quot;groundless,&quot; the Japanese company charges, adding that Fusion is actually infringing on Mitsubishi patents. Each claims the other isn't negotiating in good faith. &quot;It's become a mud-slinging match,&quot; admits Mitsubishi lawyer Masakatsu Odagiri.    Outsiders familiar with the case agree about the mud, but say it isn't clear who has the stronger case. Whatever the merits of Fusion's claims, the stalemate has become a critical test of how the U.S. and Japan work out differences over intellectual-property rights. Fusion testified about its patent difficulties before a congressional committee last June and U.S. trade negotiators often bring up the case in talks with Japan.    The real problem is that Japanese and American companies diverge radically in how they use patents. That difference could spark even fiercer battles to come. &quot;It's inevitable that intellectual property rights will become the focus of U.S.-Japan trade conflict,&quot; says a Japanese Foreign Ministry official.    The enormous difficulty of reconciling two cultures' views of rights to arcane new technologies has spurred some companies to abandon the court system altogether. International Business Machines Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd. turned to a private arbitrator to settle one of the most complex high-tech disputes ever, over software copyrights. Another long-running intellectual property battle, between Japan's NEC Corp. and Silicon Valley chip maker Intel Corp., is proceeding so sluggishly through U.S. courts that some lawyers argue the case needs an outside arbitrator.    U.S.-Japan patent clashes often stem from how the nations innovate. American technological prowess often lies in small companies such as Fusion that focus on narrow niche markets; Japan's technological might rests in mammoth conglomerates like Mitsubishi that want to do everything and have the deep pockets to do it.    These mammoths have long practiced what is called &quot;patent flooding.&quot; The practice is perfectly legal. But U.S. industry officials complain that it can work against a small U.S. company in this way: U.S. Company A introduces a widget and applies for several broad patents in Japan. Japanese Company B creates its own version of the widget and applies for hundreds of Japanese patents that make slight changes in Company A's original patents. Thus, almost any improvement A wants to make on its original technology risks violating B's patents. Company B then asks for cross licensing, a contractual agreement in which A and B would freely use each other's patents.    Fusion claims its battle with Mitsubishi fits the pattern. In 1977 a Mitsubishi research lab bought one of Fusion's &quot;electrodeless microwave lamps,&quot; used as high-quality light sources in printing, graphic arts and semiconductor production. Two years later, Mitsubishi began inundating the patent office with applications related to its own microwave lamps.    If Fusion can't quash Mitsubishi's patents or reach a licensing settlement, &quot;Fusion will be in the position someday of infringing on its own technology,&quot; says Peter Miller, Fusion's representative in Japan.    Patent flooding and cross-licensing work well for Japanese companies, which have cash hoards to fight each others' patent deluges and have thousands of patents to swap. But small U.S. companies are dwarfed by the strategy and often can't afford to fight back. Fusion has about 20 Japanese patents; Mitsubishi has filed for more than 200 Japanese patents related to the microwave-lamp technology that Fusion accuses it of stealing.    Patent flooding isn't a common ploy in America, because U.S. application laws make the cost prohibitive, one New York patent attorney says. In Japan the process is relatively inexpensive. Moreover, U.S. examiners generally award patents only for significant advances or differences in technology, while in Japan they are issued for products that differ only slightly from those covered by other patents.    Fusion estimates it would cost as much as $50,000 to contest each patent, a stiff price for any small company. Fusion is safe for now because Mitsubishi doesn't export the product and Fusion dominates the Japanese market, selling about $6 million of the lamps in Japan to Mitsubishi's $2 million. But, Mr. Spero says, it could take Fusion 20 years and $10 million dollars to block Mitsubishi's &quot;unfair&quot; patents. &quot;By that time, they've eaten us alive.&quot;    And the outlook for a settlement isn't good. Mitsubishi is furious about losing face early this year when Fusion took its beef to the press. Mr. Spero &quot;is using the press, TV, the Congress, the government, U.S. trade representative,&quot; says Shinichi Yufu, Mitsubishi's executive vice president. &quot;That is unfair.&quot;    Mitsubishi says it independently came up with the technologies in its lamp and that the Mitsubishi products that Fusion claims are copies work in a fundamentally different way from Fusion's. Mitsubishi points out that Fusion's original patented lamps, for example, were tube-like while Mitsubishi's are spherical bulbs.    Fusion retorts that Mitsubishi is making minute &quot;artificial distinctions.&quot; Fusion demanded a license for Mitsubishi's patents in 1985 and the two have been negotiating ever since. Talks have broken down many times, most recently in June when Mitsubishi offered to license its patents to Fusion if the U.S. company promised never to mention Mitsubishi's name in public and never to sell more than 10% of its shares to Japanese companies.    Fusion's Mr. Miller, who does the negotiating here, even pleaded with Mitsubishi to have a heart. Fusion is a small company, he argued, and the lamp technology represents its entire product line. The response, he says: &quot;Mitsubishi said 'We're a small, poor company, too.'&quot; (Mitsubishi's sales last year were $18.9 billion; Fusion's were $25 million.)    Fusion formally opposed three key Mitsubishi patents. The patent office initially ruled in Fusion's favor, then reversed its ruling. Fusion has appealed the ruling. Mitsubishi says the patent office's ruling proves there wasn't an infringement. Mitsubishi is willing to sell Fusion a license to its patents, says Mr. Odagiri: &quot;But unless they change their view that Mitsubishi stole technology, it'll be very difficult to reach an agreement.&quot;    In fact, Mr. Odagiri says, Fusion is trying to sully Mitsubishi's image by falsely accusing it of copying. If the bullying-and-lobbying tactics continue, he says, Mitsubishi will sue Fusion for infringement of at least one Mitsubishi patent in the U.S. and Japan. </TEXT></DOC>
