The announcement came a day after about 80,000 students fromthroughout China marched in Beijing to recharge their campaign fora freer society with less corruption.   They also demanded the fall of conservative Premier Li Peng, whodeclared martial law in the city May 20 to suppress the movement.   ``We cannot leave the square,'' student loudspeakers blared.``If the People's Liberation Army suppresses us we will become anexemplary model for all future movements to come.''   The announcers, who said they were from a leadership group,claimed 30,000 students from Beijing remained on the increasinglydirty, foul-smelling square. The numbers were inflated.   The announcement further confused the question of who is leadingthe student movement.   Activists from Beijing proposed Saturday that the occupation endTuesday and that the students concentrate on propaganda work,informing the masses of the movement's goals. Thousands of studentsare returning to their home provinces daily to spread the word.   But many of the largely out-of-town students remaining in thesquare say they will refuse to go.   Students from most of China's 31 provinces paraded through thenarrow streets of the capital's old quarters Sunday.   ``We'll keep coming until Li Peng steps down,'' the marcherschanted.   ``Li Peng is a big political thug,'' said a student from coastalShandong province.   Also Sunday, sources said government hardliners formed acensorship group to assert more control of the increasinglyindependent state-run media, which have been largely sympathetic tostudent demands.   Another 30,000 students marched against Li in Shanghai, with onebanner depicting the premier as a cockroach with a military cap.Thousands of Chinese also marched in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Sydney,Australia, to show solidarity.   Unlike demonstrations last week that drew up to 1 millionpeople, there were few non-students in the Beijing march.``Factories are now taking economic measures against workers whoparticipate,'' one student leader said.   But large crowds of residents continued to applaud protestersand to gather around university gates, reading student posters andlistening to student broadcasts.   Hardliners led by Li, who is believed to be acting for seniorleader Deng Xiaoping, reportedly have placed moderate CommunistParty General Secretary Zhao Ziyang under house arrest and removedhim from his post.   Zhao had expressed sympathy for the students, whose demandsincluded talks with the government on a freer society and an end tocorruption and profiteering by officials.   Martial law was declared in response to the student occupationof Tiananmen Square, which entered its 16th day Sunday. About10,000 students remain in the 100-acre square, down from a peak ofabout 200,000.   Beijing activists have proposed that the occupation end Tuesdayand that the students concentrate on informing the masses of themovement's goals. Thousands of students are returning to their homeprovinces daily.   But many of the students they will stay, at least until June 20,when China's legislature is expected to meet.   ``We will not leave ... We haven't achieved our goals,'' saidYao Gangfu, a sophomore at Jiangsu Chemical Engineering Institute.   People's Liberation Army troops were rushed to the outskirts ofBeijing to enforce martial law but were prevented from entering thecity by throngs of residents. Soldiers have retreated to nearbycamps and roads have cleared.   One Western analyst said about 200,000 troops have been sent toBeijing, but he believes such large numbers were called in as partof the leadership power struggle, not merely to suppress students.   Official media continued to report support for the martial lawdecree, with nationwide television saying the country's largestunion was behind the move, even though many of its members marchedwith the students.   In another step to end the protest, the party Central Committeeand the State Council ``fully affirmed (the students') patrioticenthusiasm and will not investigate and punish those students whohave voiced and committed extremist words and acts,'' the state-runXinhua News Agency reported.   A party Central Committee meeting is expected to be convenedsoon to approve the reported purge of Zhao.   Sources said the conservatives still may be determining whataccusations to make publicly against the party leader.   A document circulated among high-level party members accusesZhao of forming an anti-party coalition and using the studentmovement to seize power, one diplomatic source said.   But another document distributed to lower-level officials isless harsh, saying Zhao betrayed the party and revolution, helpedincite the demonstrations and tried to split the army, the sourcesaid.   Defense Minister Qin Jiwei, party propaganda chief Hu Qili, andVice Premier Tian Jiyun are believed included in a purge, the scopeof which remains unclear.   Many analysts feel that after Zhao's purge, Li Peng may be nextto fall because of his unpopularity.</TEXT></DOC>
