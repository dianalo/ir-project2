All three rulings were written by judges appointed by President Reagan.    Long after Mr. Reagan leaves office, his legacy will be felt in the nation's federal courtrooms. He has appointed an unprecedented 334 federal judges, 45% of the total. These judges are transforming the federal courts, which not long ago were seen as paramount protectors of individual liberties and minority rights, into stern enforcers of criminal law, narrow interpreters of the Constitution and defenders of executive authority.    Among the results, according to new academic studies and interviews with legal experts: Prison sentences for those convicted of federal crimes grow longer. Death-row inmates find it harder to convince federal judges that their rights were violated at their trials. Claims that employers or local governments discriminated based on race, sex or age become tougher to win. Plaintiffs face more procedural hurdles at the courthouse door. And many liberal lawyers are taking their cases to state courts instead of federal courts when they have that option.    &quot;The Reagan court-packing is definitely tilting the courts to the right on some issues, although it is a bit early to see the full effect,&quot; says Herman Schwartz, a liberal professor at American University's law school here who has just written a book on the president's judicial appointments. With Senate approval of Mr. Reagan's third Supreme Court justice, Judge Anthony Kennedy, likely Wednesday, conservative leadership at the top of the judiciary is increasing as well.    Conservatives applaud Mr. Reagan's judicial record. &quot;There is no question that this is the most lasting and significant achievement of the Reagan administration,&quot; says James McClellan, the director of the Center for Judicial Studies. &quot;The impact of these appointments will spill over to the next century.&quot;    Administration officials say their aim isn't to find judges to carry out a conservative agenda but to find judges who will follow the law and practice restraint. &quot;The best things some of our judges may do . . . relate to the decisions they don't hand down, institutions they don't try to administer, new rights they don't concoct,&quot; says Stephen Markman, an assistant attorney general who oversees Justice Department judicial selection. &quot;We're looking for judges who understand that their job is not to do justice but to do justice under law.&quot; He says many of the 264 judges President Carter named have used the courts for liberal goals.    Some changes in the federal courts, although subtle, suggest judges pursuing a conservative agenda. On several appeals courts where Reagan appointees are in the majority, the number of full-court reviews of three-judge-panel decisions, while still small, has increased. One reason is that when the losing party in a panel decision seeks review, the Reagan appointees sometimes vote as a bloc to review and reverse rulings. Such judges also are using decisions to send messages to the Supreme Court.    Some decisions by Reagan appointees are more obvious signs of change:   --Last May, two federal appeals judges in Chicago, Richard Posner and Frank Easterbrook, voted to uphold a Chicago law imposing tough conditions on landlords. But in a separate opinion, they went out of their way to criticize it as bad law, faulted its economic impact and suggested other legal arguments that could be used to fight it.    --Judges Daniel Mahoney and Richard Cardamone of the appeals court in New York City ruled in December that the government may, in effect, by seizing tainted assets, make it more difficult for drug and racketeering defendants to hire lawyers. Last month Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson, a Reagan appointee on the appeals court in Richmond, took a similar view of a 1984 federal law that permits seizure of some defendants' assets.    --In January 1987, Judge Edith Jones of the appeals court in New Orleans wrote an opinion throwing out a judge's order that Texas transfer 279 mentally retarded people from state schools to community centers. Joined by a fellow Reagan appointee, Judge Eugene Davis, she said a federal court had no authority to impose such a requirement on a state.    --District Judge Thomas Hull ruled in October 1986 that some fundamentalist Christian families in Tennessee could keep their children out of public-school reading classes because of religious objections to the textbooks. A federal appeals court, including one Reagan appointee, reversed the decision, 3-0.    The most obvious conservative push by President Reagan's appointees is on affirmative action, where decisions curbing racial preferences correspond to the administration's own position.    Last March, Judge Alex Kozinski of the appeals court in San Francisco struck down a San Francisco plan earmarking 30% of city contracts for minority-owned businesses and 10% for firms owned by women. He said a city can use racial preferences only if it has discriminated itself and not to correct general societal bias, a view that has split the Supreme Court and failed to gain a majority there.    In an appeals-court ruling last July, Judge Wilkinson rejected Richmond's goal of 30% of its construction business for minority contractors. Judge Robert Krupansky of the appeals court in Cincinnati wrote an opinion last November voiding Michigan's preference in state contracts for businesses owned by blacks and women. In Washington, D.C., last year, Appeals Judges Kenneth Starr and Laurence Silberman twice ruled against an affirmative-action plan for black firefighters.    In an appeal of the Richmond case to the Supreme Court, the National League of Cities and the U.S. Conference of Mayors warn in a brief that the appeals court's rationale threatens affirmative action in 32 states and 160 cities and counties.    Mr. Reagan's appointees have had an impact on other civil-rights issues. A study of district-court decisions from 1981 through 1985 says Carter appointees voted for those claiming race bias 59% of the time, Reagan appointees 13%. Carter appointees found bias against the handicapped 61% of the time, Reagan appointees 25%, according to the study by two political science professors, C.K. Rowland of the University of Kansas and Robert Carp of the University of Houston.    A recent Columbia Law Review study of federal appeals courts, while showing that Reagan appointees are generally no more conservative than those of other Republican presidents, says the Reagan appointees are more likely than other Republican-selected judges to disagree with Democratic-appointed colleagues in civil-rights cases.    In criminal cases from 1981 through 1984, according to Profs. Rowland and Carp, Mr. Reagan's district-court appointees supported defendants 24% of the time, Carter appointees 47% and those appointed by President Nixon 32%.    In death-penalty appeals, in which inmates assert that their constitutional rights were violated by police or prosecutors, &quot;Reagan appointees have been categorically opposed to relief for people on death row,&quot; says Robert McGlassen, a professor at the University of Texas Law School Capital Punishment Clinic.    One phenomenon, says Eric Schnapper of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc., is that Reagan appeals-court judges are more likely to overturn jury verdicts in civil cases, an idea he says is difficult to reconcile with restraint. Three-judge panels with one or more Reagan appointees overturned juries 55% of the time in Mr. Schnapper's study of decisions from the fall of 1984 to the fall of 1985. Panels with no Reagan appointees reversed juries 41% of the time.    The makeup of the courts also is changing in terms of sex and race. Mr. Reagan has appointed 28 women and 20 members of minority groups, while President Carter named 40 women and 55 minority-group members -- a difference that will get a critical examination at a Judiciary Committee hearing tomorrow initiated by Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts. &quot;We appear to be going back to a male-dominated judiciary,&quot; says Prof. Sheldon Goldman of the University of Massachusetts, who studies the backgrounds of judges.    Compared with other judges, says Prof. Goldman, the Reagan appointees are also somewhat younger, especially the appeals-court judges, and therefore likely to serve longer; they are somewhat wealthier; and they include fewer nominees from the other party.    The current battleground is in Congress. The administration charges that the same Democratic-controlled Judiciary Committee that helped bring down the Supreme Court nomination of federal Judge Robert Bork is dragging its feet on 27 federal court nominees. But the administration has yet to fill an additional 28 spots. And administration officials themselves delayed the nomination of William Dwyer in Seattle when they thought he was too moderate. They also moved slowly on vacancies in Pennsylvania while looking for conservatives.    Democrats express a concern, as Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont said last year, about a &quot;decline in the caliber&quot; of nominees. A number of the pending nominations face controversy as the debate over the Reagan appointees grows.    To conservatives, the Reagan judges are balancing liberal excesses of the past. &quot;In the civil-rights area, some plaintiffs are attempting to make public policy through the courts, and Reagan judges properly reject that,&quot; says Jeffery Troutt, the director of the Free Congress Foundation's Judicial Reform Project.    Many liberal lawyers say they fear taking to federal court rights cases that they now could lose, thus risking a scaling back rather than an expansion of existing law. Says Robert Lehrer, deputy director of the Legal Assistance Foundation in Chicago: &quot;I'm just not going to approve an aggressive case that is trying to expand the boundaries of some right.&quot;    ---      Number of Federal Judges Appointed by Presidents                          Appeals Courts   District Courts    Reagan                      76               258    Carter                      58               206    Ford                        12                52    Nixon                       45               179    Johnson                     40               122</TEXT></DOC>
