But the job does carry with it a sobering potential responsibility: to succeed the president in case of death, resignation or impeachment.    This fact has given vital significance to the public scrutiny of Messrs. Quayle and Bentsen and to their debate last week. But for the first 50 years of our nation's history, the position of vice president held no such importance: According to the way many political leaders of those years read the Constitution, there was no clear line of succession. No president had died in office, so the issue never had come up.    However, when the ninth president, William Henry Harrison, died a month after taking office in 1841, there arose around his vice president, John Tyler, one of the fiercest political controversies in U.S. history. There was, of course, no precedent for whether the vice president should be accorded the full power of the president or be regarded simply as acting chief executive. And the Constitution's language contributed to the problem, stating that &quot;in case of the removal of the President from office or his death, resignation or inability to discharge the powers and duties of said office, the same shall devolve on the vice-president.&quot;    Did &quot;the same&quot; mean the office or the duties? Tyler said it meant the office, but his interpretation was not accepted by all Whig or Democratic leaders, newspaper editors or even his own inherited cabinet. Many maintained that the Founding Fathers did not intend the office to devolve on the vice president, just the duties.    Despite the doubts, Tyler acted decisively. Harrison died at 12:30 a.m. on Sunday, April 4. Tyler, who had returned to his home in Williamsburg following the inauguration, rode 53 hours on horseback after receiving the news of Harrison's death. He reached Washington around 5 a.m. Tuesday, April 6, convinced that he was the actual president, not an ad interim administrator. He felt the oath that he had taken as vice president was sufficient to assume the office of president, but in order to forestall any problems, he took a second oath. He was sworn into office by William Cranch, chief judge of the circuit court of Washington, D.C. Chief Justice Roger Taney was nearby in Baltimore, but refused to administer the oath because he hadn't been officially requested to do so.    As a vice presidential candidate on the Whig ticket, Tyler had done little campaigning, and he was not perceived as an important leader by politicians or the public. In fact, in the famous 1840 campaign slogan -- &quot;Tippecanoe and Tyler Too&quot; -- his name came as a sort of afterthought. As vice president, he had been expected to have little responsibility.    Now that he claimed the presidency, he met strong resistance, especially from former President John Quincy Adams, who insisted that Tyler was merely an &quot;acting president.&quot; Adams felt Tyler's ascent to the presidency was &quot;in direct violation both of grammar and context of the Constitution.&quot;    Certainly the Whigs were stunned by the turn of events. In Tyler, they found themselves with a party leader who subscribed to few, if any, of their policies. Tyler had been a Democrat and was still a Democrat at heart who supported states' rights and opposed a national bank, in direct contrast to the beliefs of Henry Clay, the most powerful Whig.    Tyler held firm and won the day, although nearly six weeks after taking office his official status was still being questioned by Congress. On May 31, New York Rep. John McKeon rose in the House to inquire if Tyler was indeed officially the &quot;president.&quot;    Not surprisingly, Tyler's nearly four-year term as president was a stormy one. He was constantly at odds with the Whigs, who controlled both houses. They were especially angered by his repeated vetoes of the national bank and high-tariff bills. Eventually, the Whigs disowned and denounced him, leading Henry Clay to call him the &quot;president without a party.&quot;    Dissatisfaction with Tyler eventually led to impeachment proceedings against him, the first president to be so dubiously honored. The impeachment resolution, however, was defeated, 127-83, in the House.    Despite all his problems, Tyler decided to run for re-election in 1844 as a Democrat. He was nominated at a Baltimore convention, but was persuaded to withdraw from the campaign several months later. This move was thought to have helped elect Democrat &quot;dark horse&quot; James Polk while defeating Tyler's nemesis Henry Clay.    ---   Mr. Sparks is a writer in York, Pa. </TEXT></DOC>
