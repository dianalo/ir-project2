Reagan, who commanded vast audiences until he left office inJanuary ago, is now out of the limelight, retired into the selectclub of former presidents that includes Gerald Ford, Richard Nixonand Jimmy Carter.   Occasionally, the former president pops back into the news. BothPresident Bush and Vice President Quayle visited him this week inSouthern California. And his name came up more negatively inrepeated references during the Iran-Contra trial of former WhiteHouse aide Oliver North.   Would one have expected a less reclusive retirement givenReagan's popularity during his two-term tenure?   Probably not, agree president watchers. They differ, however, onwhether it's the nature of the man or the nature of the systemwhich is responsible.   ``It's not unusual and not at all atypical historically for aformer president to slip from sight,'' said Stephen Hess, apresidential scholar at the Brookings Institution, an independentthink tank.   The advent of a new president is accompanied by a flurry ofmedia attention and public curiosity, Hess said, and the formerWhite House occupant generally just drifts away from power, Hesssaid.   Reagan, 78, works in his offices atop a Los Angeles skyscraper,say his aides. He writes speeches on such favorite topics as theneed for a line-item veto, a balanced budget amendment and an endto the two-term limit for presidents. He has joined the board ofthe conservative magazine National Review and also is planning towrite his memoirs.   Reagan has been virtually mum on the presidency of hissuccessor, and he is rarely mentioned in Washington.   One way for former presidents to step back into the limelight isto take a shot at their predecessor. Thus, Jimmy Carter made thenews in 1981 when he criticized Reagan's budget proposal forplacing too much emphasis on defense spending and not enough ondomestic programs.   ``But most ex-presidents are obliging and they stay out of thehair of the current occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,'' saidBenjamin Ginsberg, a professor of government at Cornell University.   Bush also has been careful to avoid criticism of hispredecessor. Last month, White House Chief of Staff John Sununuadmonished aides to refrain from unfavorable comparisons of Reaganand Bush.   Some former presidents have made a comeback several years later,returning to vogue once a historical perspective of theirpresidency has been established. Such was the case with HarryTruman, who left office in 1953 an unpopular leader but was seen ina far more favorable light in the 1960s and until he died in 1972.   Presidents who cannot bear the obscurity of retirement are rare.Theodore Roosevelt didn't want to be an ex-president so he ranagainst fellow Republican William Howard Taft in 1912. His runsplit the Republican vote, and gave Democrat Woodrow Wilson theWhite House.   ``Reagan is not about to upstage Bush,'' said Tom Korologos, alobbyist and Reagan friend who once served the Nixon and Fordadministrations as a legislative aide. ``Reagan did more for Bushthan any other president has done for his VP, and now he knows it'stime to get out of the picture,'' he said.   Ginsberg and several other scholars and consultants believe Bushaides are particularly anxious that Reagan maintain a low profilefor the time being. ``Bush lived in Reagan's shadow for eightyears. Now he needs to establish himself as an independent anddistance himself in some ways,'' Ginsberg said.   Bush himself doesn't mention his predecessor very often as heseeks to move subtly away from some of the domestic and foreignpolicies known as the Reagan legacy.   For example, in reaching a compromise agreement with Congress onaid to the Nicaraguan Contras, Bush effectively killed futuremilitary aid to the rebels _ a cause dear to Reagan's heart.   ``It's a mark of Reagan's respect for Bush that he has bittenhis lip and avoided statements even on the things he felt sopassionately about like the Contras,'' said Stuart Eizenstat, whoserved as Carter's domestic policy adviser and is now a politicalconsultant.</TEXT></DOC>
