Concentrating collectors turned out to beunsuitable in this application. The amount of solar energy which canbe used is too small. The mechanism of the louvre system turned out tobe unsuitable for the strong temperature changes. As far as the unitcould be operated, satisfactory results were obtained. The two remainingsystems saved about 20% of the energy required after subtracting theauxiliary power. The greenhouse used as a collector seemed to be favourable.The project was continued from 1983 to 1985 with two solar systems anda reference greenhouse. The new foil collector and the greenhouse usedas a collector were not profitable from the economic point of view. Withimproved insulation of the houses good results were obtained. The projectwas accompanied by systems analysis and simulation models. An analysisof the plants showed that the light reduction inherent within the systemsled to a retardation in plant growth. In the greenhouse used as a collector,a good growth rate was observed. With 5 refs., 12 tabs., 50 figs..</TEXT></DOC>
