The results areencouraging in the case where for R142b, the experimental values arein agreement with the theory and enable one to envisage energy productionat 95 deg C and where for non-azeotropic mixtures, experiences revealthe mysteries which prevail upon their behaviour in the presence of systemleaks of the heat pumps.</TEXT></DOC>
