Border Posts On Afghan-Pakistan Frontier</HEAD><HEAD>With AM-Afghanistan</HEAD><BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Soviet Union said Tuesday it wantsU.N. military observers posted between Afghanistan and Pakistan tostop cross-border raids by the Islamic guerrillas seeking to topplethe communist government in Kabul.   ``It is very important now to look into the situation on theborder between Afghanistan and Pakistan,'' Soviet U.N. AmbassadorAleksandr M. Belonogov said after meeting with Secretary-GeneralJavier Perez de Cuellar.   ``The government of Afghanistan is suggesting that UnitedNations (military) observers should be posted in the border area,and we think this is the right idea.''   The 50 military observers of the U.N. Good Offices Mission inAfghanistan and Pakistan monitored the Soviet troop withdrawal fromAfghanistan that ended Feb. 15.   Belonogov said the observers now should focus on what he saidwas Pakistan's policy of allowing the guerrillas to operate frombases in Pakistan.   He said he believes ``the situation now demands much moreattention by ... (the Good Offices Mission) to the border areabetween Afghanistan and Pakistan.''   U.S. officials were unavailable for comment.   Earlier in the day, the State Department declined comment whentwo lower-ranking Soviet diplomats suggested in Washington that theUnited Nations consider posting U.N. border monitors.   Belonogov said that he ``also drew the attention of thesecretary-general to the inadequate situation with regard to theimplementation of the Geneva Accords,'' under which the Soviet armyleft Afghanistan.   Those accords, signed last April 14, require Afghanistan andPakistan not to interfere in each others' internal affairs.   ``We are proud that we honored our obligations under theagreements and that at the moment there are no Soviet soldiers onAfghan soil, but at the same time we are concerned that these arenot honored, they are disregarded by Pakistan,'' said Belonogov.   ``We are now witnessing deeper involvement by Pakistan into theinternal affairs of Afghanistan.''   The Soviets and Afghanistan accuse Pakistan of letting therebels maintain bases on its territory and launch cross-borderraids. They also say the United States violates the accords bysupplying the guerrillas with weapons.   The rebels also received support from China and Saudi Arabia.Other rebels operating in western Pakistan receive aid from Iran.   Afghan officers have accused Pakistani officers of directing thecurrent rebel seige of the Afghan city of Jalalabad, 75 miles eastof Kabul.</TEXT></DOC>
