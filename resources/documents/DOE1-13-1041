For the accomplishment of this task a detailed analysisof the morphological data is undertaken. The results of the analysislead to a mathematical structure model. Based on this model the recognitionand measuring of the object in an adaptive heuristic process is undertaken.In this case it dealt with a desmodontal split, whose change is indicatedby a periodontal bone atrophy. The contour recognition is embedded ina newly created image processing system, which allows itself to be usedgenerally and is shown using the presentation of coronary vessels asan example. The exactness of the automatic image evaluation in comparisonto the measuring done by the doctor is discussed. (orig./TRV).</TEXT></DOC>
