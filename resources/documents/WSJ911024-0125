Outside monitors of production by the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries confirmed yesterday that Kuwaitalready is producing more than 400,000 barrels a day, avolume it hadn't been expected to reach until late this year.</LP><TEXT>   The additional supplies, which could put downward pressureon oil prices, are coming at a time when they may not beneeded unless the winter is particularly severe and demandincreases faster than anticipated.   Kuwaiti officials recently have noted that the remainderof the oil-well fires set by departing Iraqi troops will beextinguished by next month. Also, new wells are beingdrilled, and the officials have indicated increasingconfidence of reaching their target of one million barrels aday by mid-1992.   Just before the Iraqi invasion in August 1990, Kuwait wasproducing at its OPEC quota of 1.5 million barrels a day. Butearlier, it had regularly cheated on its quota to producearound two million barrels a day. And there were suggestionsyesterday that Kuwait plans to return to thattwo-million-barrel level as soon as it can.   According to Dow Jones International Petroleum Report, adraft memorandum sent by Kuwaiti officials to bankers inconnection with the $5 billion in loans they are seeking saysKuwait's production should reach 1.7 million barrels a day bythe 1993 third quarter. Also, the memorandum says, production&quot;is expected to rise to two million barrels a day shortlythereafter.&quot;   Largely because of the pace at which the Kuwaiti oilindustry is recovering from the severe damage it receivedfrom the Persian Gulf War and from Iraqi sabotage, OPECoutput also is nearing former levels. According to themonitors of OPEC's production, output now is at least 23.8million barrels a day, some 200,000 barrels a day higher thanin September, and is expected to rise further before Octoberends.   &quot;We should see an average of 23.9 million or 24 million{barrels a day} for the month of October,&quot; said ConradGerber, president of Petro-Logistics Ltd., a Geneva concernwhich tracks OPEC output for its clients, including some ofthe 13 OPEC member nations.   OPEC most recently produced at these levels in the firsthalf of 1990. That was before the Persian Gulf crisis thattriggered the United Nations embargo against Iraqi oilexports and the subsequent damage to Kuwaiti oil facilities.   The figures suggest the world's oil supplies will beplentiful this winter despite the recent rally in petroleumprices and recurring reports that the Soviet Union's oilexports now have fallen by one-third this year, to some twomillion barrels a day. Still, oil analysts maintain thatthere isn't any room for surprises such as an unusually coldwinter or some other disruption in oil supplies.   &quot;Supply and demand are in a pretty fragile balance,&quot; saidCristina Haus, who monitors OPEC production for EnergySecurity Analysis Inc. of Washington. She estimates OPECproduction will average 23.9 million barrels a day forOctober, on its way to 24 million. But she noted that thatlevel will likely be the peak for the fourth quarter. &quot;Theproblem,&quot; she added, &quot;is that there is not much sparecapacity except in Kuwait.&quot;   Although the UN has approved a temporary lifting of theembargo against Iraqi oil to permit sales of $1.6 billion forhumanitarian reasons, Iraq still isn't exporting any oilexcept for small volumes being sent to Jordan. But Iraq hasenormous potential. And this week, Osama A.R. Al-Hiti, Iraq'soil minister, told a Baghdad news conference that foreign oilcompanies would be offered attractive terms to help Iraqdevelop some of its new oil fields.   For the moment, however, Kuwait offers the chief prospectfor additional oil. Production within its borders is nowestimated at around 270,000 barrels a day for October.Additionally, one-half the Neutral Zone's 300,000 barrels ofoil a day is produced for Kuwait's account. The remaindergoes to Saudi Arabia.</TEXT></DOC>
