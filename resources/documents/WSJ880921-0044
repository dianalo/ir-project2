The December contract rose 3.21 cents a pound to $1.2713, near the high of the day.    The International Coffee Organization's full 75-member council began two weeks of deliberations in London Monday to establish export quotas and the price ranges that can affect the quotas for the 1988-89 ICO coffee year, which begins Oct. 1.    Consuming countries have had problems obtaining sufficient quantities of higher-quality mild coffees to meet their needs. At the beginning of the current season, the overall global export quota was 58 million bags, but this was whittled down to 51.5 million bags because of quota reductions triggered by weak prices. The coffee pact uses export quotas to prop up prices.    The smaller export quotas exacerbated the tightness of mild coffee supplies, while other types, such as Robustas, are available in ample quantities.    Speculation before the talks began was that consuming countries, led by the U.S., would fight for a change in quota allocations to permit increased amounts of mild coffees to enter the world market.    &quot;Apparently traders took as positive the statement by U.S. negotiator Jon Rosenbaum that the U.S. wouldn't seek to change the producer allocation formula agreed upon last year and would, instead, try to ensure larger amounts of mild coffees through other means, such as making those growths exempt from quota cuts,&quot; said Sandra Kaul, analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., New York.    The 1988-89 allocation formula would work exactly the opposite of consumers' current needs, Ms. Kaul said. It calls for an increase in exports by Brazil, the world's top producer, and reductions in Colombian and other mild coffee export quotas, she said. Even if mild coffees were exempt from quota cuts, she added, these growths would still be in tight supply because such an action wouldn't add more milds to the market, only maintain the status quo.    &quot;It looks like the U.S. may be willing to write off this year and make a stand next year, when the agreement itself is scheduled to expire,&quot; Ms. Kaul said.    A coffee dealer who is familiar with ICO negotiations said the U.S. was in a difficult spot. &quot;The allocation formula was dictated by the U.S. last year,&quot; he said. &quot;The U.S. can hardly come in now and say a mistake has been made and should be changed.&quot;    One partial solution, he said, would be to change rules about exporting in equal quarterly amounts so that larger quantities can be shipped from October through December. That is when roasters increase their purchases of green, unroasted beans in preparation for the peak consumption period in January and February.    The dealer said that, although it is still too early to tell, he thought an overall global export quota of 58 million bags was likely to be agreed upon.    &quot;It wouldn't solve the consuming countries' problems through the end of September 1989, but when the ICO convenes in September of next year, the consuming countries could have a weapon in a threat to walk away from the agreement totally and return to a completely free market, which would pit the producers into competition with each other, something they don't want,&quot; he said.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   COPPER: Futures prices continued to rise, with the September contract again setting a new high on tight supplies and steady demand. September delivery copper ended at $1.1385 a pound, up 1.45 cents, after rising to a life-of-contract high of $1.1465 in earlier trading. Fred Demler, metal specialist for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., noted that dealer premiums for copper have risen sharply. &quot;Back in July copper was offered to the U.S. Mint at 0.10 cent below the September futures price. Today, September delivery copper in the cash market commands a 4 1/2-cents premium,&quot; he said. Mr. Demler cited production problems in Peru and Chile, which have hampered shipments of the metal, and a production drop of about 10% in Zambia and Zaire from year-earlier levels. Global output of refined copper in the first quarter of this year was up about 8% from the year-earlier period, but in the second quarter was flat, he said. However, he noted, consumption of refined copper rose steadily and was up 1% in the first half of this year. U.S. producer stocks are at record lows and stocks in exchange warehouses are starting to fall again, he added.    COTTON: Futures prices were narrowly mixed as increased rainfall helped Texas crops. December delivery cotton declined 0.06 cent a pound to 50.62, but most other contracts were slightly higher. According to an analyst, rains from Hurricane Gilbert moved into north central and western Texas. &quot;Those are the areas where there is still cotton standing in Texas,&quot; he said. &quot;They needed the rain. They got between one and three inches, and welcomed it.&quot;    PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices eased under continued selling. December delivery gold ended at $411.30 an ounce for a loss of $4.10, after dropping to a new life-of-contract low of $407 during the session. December silver was off 11.8 cents an ounce to $6.357, while October platinum declined $8.10 an ounce to $494.90, dropping below the $500 support level that drew buying on Monday. There was no new price-depressing news, according to one analyst, who said that bearish fundamental factors continued to dominate the market and draw sellers into it. Another analyst said that investors seem apathetic about buying bullion, particularly as fears of inflation wane.    LIVESTOCK AND MEAT: Live hog futures rose sharply amid anticipation that a government report will show a slowdown in the rate of increase in breeding hogs. The Agriculture Department report, a 10-state hog population survey set for release Friday, is expected to show that the number of breeding hogs as of Sept. 1 rose, at most, 2% from year-earlier levels. Last year's September report showed a 7% increase. &quot;The growth of the breeding herd has been slowing,&quot; said Thomas Morgan, a livestock analyst at Sterling Research Corp., Arlington Heights, Ill. Analysts cited the rising cost of feed grain. Also, yesterday's rally was spurred by anticipation that retailers will advertise more pork specials in early October. Live cattle futures rose modestly. </TEXT></DOC>
