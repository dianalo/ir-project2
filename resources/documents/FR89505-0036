Theseamendments are proposed to conform the Income Tax Regulations to section67 of the Tax Reform Act of 1984 (Pub. L. No. 98-369; 98 Stat. 585), whichadded sections 280G and 4999 to the Code and amended Code sections 275(a)(6)and 3121(v)(2)(A), and to section 1804(j) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986(Pub. L. No. 99-514; 100 Stat. 2807) and section 1018(d) (6)-(8) of theTechnical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 (Pub. L. No. 100-647; 102Stat. 3581), which amended Code section 280G. These provisions relate togolden parachute payments. Specifically, section 280G denies a deductionfor any ``excess parachute payment,'' section 4999 imposes a 20- percentexcise tax on the recipient of any excess parachute payment, section 275(a)(6)denies a deduction for the section 4999 excise tax, and section 3121(v)(2)(A)relates to FICA. <ITAG tagnum="84">Overview of Statutory Provisions </ITAG>In applying the golden parachute provisions, the first step is to identifypayments that constitute ``parachute payments.'' Section 280G(b)(2)(A)defines a ``parachute payment'' as any payment that meets all of the followingfour conditions: (a) The payment is in the nature of compensation; (b)the payment is to, or for the benefit of, a disqualified individual; (c)the payment is contingent on a change in the ownership of a corporation,the effective control of a corporation, or the ownership of a substantialportion of the assets of a corporation (``change in ownership or control'');and (d) the payment has (together with other payments described above in(a), (b), and (c) with respect to the same individual) an aggregate presentvalue of at least 3 times the individual's base amount. For this purpose, an individual's base amount is, in general, the individual'saverage annualized includible compensation for the most recent 5 taxableyears ending before the change in ownership or control. Section 280G(b)(2)(B) provides that the term ``parachute payment'' alsoincludes any payment in the nature of compensation to, or for the benefitof, a disqualified individual if the payment is pursuant to an agreementthat violates any generally enforced securities laws or regulations (``securitiesviolation parachute payment''). Once payments are identified as ``parachute payments'', the next step isto determine any ``excess'' portion of the payments. Section 280G(b)(1)defines the term ``excess parachute payment'' as an amount equal to theexcess of any parachute payment over the portion of the disqualified individual'sbase amount that is allocated to such payment. For this purpose, the portionof the base amount allocated to a parachute payment is the amount thatbears the same ratio to the base amount as the present value of the parachutepayment bears to the aggregate present value of all such payments to thesame disqualified individual. Generally, excess parachute payments may be reduced by certain amountsof reasonable compensation. Section 280G(b)(4)(B) provides that exceptin the case of securities violation parachute payments, the amount of anexcess parachute payment is reduced by any portion of the payment thatthe taxpayer establishes by clear and convincing evidence is reasonablecompensation for personal services actually rendered by the disqualifiedindividual before the date of change in ownership or control. Such reasonablecompensation is first offset against the portion of the base amount allocatedto the payment. <ITAG tagnum="84">Exempt Payments</ITAG>Section 280G specifically exempts several types of payments from the definitionof the term ``parachute payment.'' Deductions for payments exempt from the definition of ``parachute payment''are not disallowed by section 280G, and such exempt payments are not subjectto the 20-percent excise tax of section 4999. In addition, such exemptpayments are not taken into account in applying the threetimes-base-amounttest of section 280G(b)(2)(A)(ii). Section 280G(b)(5) provides an exemption for payments with respect to certaincorporations. Pursuant to that section, the term ``parachute payment''does not include any payment made to a disqualified individual with respectto a corporation which, immediately before the change in ownership or control,was a small business corporation (as defined in section 1361(b) but withoutregard to paragraph (1)(C) thereof). In addition, the term ``parachutepayment'' does not include any payment made with respect to a corporationif, immediately before the change in ownership or control, no stock inthe corporation was readily tradable on an established securities market(or otherwise) and certain shareholder approval requirements are met withrespect to the payment. For this purpose, stock that is described in section1504 (a)(4) is not treated as being readily tradable on an establishedsecurities market if the payment does not adversely affect the shareho1der'sredemption and liquidation rights. The proposed regulations provide guidanceon applying the exemptions contained in section 280G(b)(5). Section 280G(b)(6) exempts certain payments under a qualified plan. Pursuantto that section, the term ``parachute payment'' does not include any paymentto or from: (a) A plan described in section 401(a) which includes a trustexempt from tax under section 501(a); (b) an annuity plan described insection 403(a); or (c) a simplified employee pension as defined in section408(k). Finally, section 280G(b)(4)(A) exempts certain payments of reasonable compensation.Pursuant to that section, except in the case of securities violation parachutepayments, the term ``parachute payment'' does not include the portion ofany payment which the taxpayer establishes by clear and convincing evidenceis reasonable compensation for personal services to be rendered on or afterthe date of the change in ownership or control. The proposed regulationsprovide guidance for determining amounts of reasonable compensation. <ITAG tagnum="84">Disqualified Individuals </ITAG>To be a parachute payment, a payment must be made to (or for the benefitof) a ``disqualified individual.'' Section 280G(c) defines the term ``disqualifiedindividual'' to include any individual who (a) is an employee or independentcontractor who performs personal services for a corporation, and (b) isan officer, shareholder, or highlycompensated individual. The proposedregulations provide guidance on who will be treated as an ``officer,''a ``shareholder,'' and a ``highly-compensated individual'' for this purpose.Section 280G(c) provides that a ``highly-compensated individual'' withrespect to a corporation only includes an individual who is (or would beif the individual were an employee) a member of the group consisting ofthe highest paid l percent of the employees of the corporation or, if less,the 250 highest paid employees of the corporation. The proposed regulationsprovide rules for applying this definition. In addition, the proposed regulationsprovide that no individual whose annual compensation is less than $75,000will be treated as a highly compensated individual. The proposed regulationsalso provide an exception to the definition of ``highly-compensated individual''to prevent fees earned by independent service providers (such as independentbrokers, attorneys, and investment bankers) from becoming subject to section280G when they perform services in connection with a change in ownershipor control. With respect to who will be treated as a ``shareholder'' for purposes ofsection 280G(c), the proposed regulations provide a <T3>de minimis </T3>rule. Pursuant to this rule, only an individual whoowns stock of a corporation having a value that exceeds the lesser of $1million, or l percent of the total value of the outstanding shares of allclasses of the corporation's stock, is treated as a disqualified individualwith respect to the corporation by reason of stock ownership. For purposesof determining the amount of the stock owned by an individual, the constructiveownership rules of section 318(a) shall apply. The proposed regulations also limit the number of employees who will betreated as disqualified individuals with respect to a corporation by reasonof being ``officers'' of the corporation. The proposed regulations providethat no more than 50 employees (or, if less, the greater of 3 employeesor 10 percent of the employees of the corporation) will be treated as disqualifiedindividuals with respect to a corporation by reason of being an officerof the corporation. In the case of an affiliated group treated as one corporation,the previous sentence will be applied to each member of such group. <ITAG tagnum="84">Contingent on Change </ITAG>To be a parachute payment, a payment must be contingent on a change inownership or control. The proposed regulations provide rules on when apayment will be treated as so ``contingent.''In general, a payment will be treated as contingent on a change in ownershipor control if the payment would not in fact have been made had no changein ownership or control occurred. A payment generally will be treated asone which would not in fact have been made in the absence of a change inownership or control unless it is substantially certain, at the time ofthe change, that the payment would have been made whether or not the changeoccurred. In addition, a payment generally is treated as contingent ona change in ownership of control if (a) the payment is contingent on anevent that is closely associated with such a change, (b) a change in ownershipor control actually occurs, and (c) the event is materially related tothe change in ownership or control. Some types of events that are consideredclosely associated with a change in ownership or control are the onsetof a tender offer, the termination of the disqualified individual's employment,and a significant reduction in the disqualified individual's job responsibilities.Moreover, a payment will be treated as contingent on a change in ownershipor control if the change accelerates the time at which the payment is made.However, if it is substantially certain at the time of the change thatthe payment would have been made whether or not the change occurred, butthe payment is treated as contingent on the change solely because the changeaccelerates the time at which the payment is made, only a portion of thepayment will be treated as contingent on the change. In such case, theportion of the payment that will be treated as contingent on the changeis the amount by which the amount of the accelerated payment exceeds thepresent value of the payment absent the acceleration. In addition, if apayment is accelerated by a change in ownership or control and the paymentis substantially certain, at the time of the change, to have been madewithout regard to such change provided that the disqualified individualhad continued to perform services for the corporation for a specified periodof time, only a portion of the payment is treated as contingent on thechange. The proposed regulations provide rules for determining the portionof the payment so treated. The proposed regulations provide that paymentsmade pursuant to an agreement that is entered into after a change in ownershipor control wiIl not be treated as contingent on the change. However, forthis purpose, an agreement that is executed after a change in ownershipor control pursuant to a legally enforceable agreement that was enteredinto before the change will be considered to have been entered into beforethe change. <ITAG tagnum="84">Presumption That Payment Is Contingent on Change </ITAG>Section 280G(b)(2)(C) provides a presumption that certain payments arecontingent on a change in ownership or control. Specifically, this provisionprovides that any payment pursuant to an agreement (or an amendment ofa previous agreement) that is entered into within one year before a changein ownership or control is presumed to be contingent on such change unlessthe contrary is established by clear and convincing evidence. The proposed regulations provide that an amendment of a previous agreementtriggers this presumption only if the previous agreement is amended ``inany significant respect.'' The proposed regulations also provide that whenthe presumption is triggered by an amendment, only the portion of a paymentthat exceeds the amount of such payment that would have been made in theabsence of the amendment is presumed, by reason of the amendment, to becontingent on the change in ownership or control. In addition, the proposed regulations provide that if an agreement is enteredinto within one year before the date of a change in ownership or control,clear and convincing evidence that the agreement is (a) a nondiscriminatoryemployee plan or program; (b) a contract that replaces a prior contractentered into by the same parties more than one year before the change inownership or control (if the new contract meets certain requirements);or (c) a contract between a corporation and a disqualified individual whodid not perform services for the corporation prior to the individual'staxable year in which the change in ownership or control occurs (if thecontract meets certain requirements); generally will rebut the presumptionthat payments under the agreement are contingent on the change. <ITAG tagnum="84">Change in Ownership or Control </ITAG>The proposed regulations also provide guidance on when a change in ownershipor control will be considered to occur. The regulations provide that achange in the ownership of a corporation occurs when any one person, ormore than one person acting as a group, acquires ownership of stock ofthe corporation that, together with stock held by such person or group,has more than 50 percent of the total fair market value or voting powerof all of the corporation's outstanding stock. Section 318(a) will applyin determining stock ownership for this purpose.The proposed regulations provide that a change in the ownership of a substantialportion of the assets of a corporation occurs when any one person, or morethan one person acting as a group, acquires (or has acquired during the12 months ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such personor persons) assets from the corporation that have a total fair market valueequal to or more than one third of the total fair market value of all ofthe assets of the corporation immediately prior to such acquisition oracquisitions. However, the proposed regulations provide that a transferof assets by a corporation will not be treated as a change in ownershipif the assets are transferred to certain shareholders of the corporationor to an entity at least 50 percent of the total value or voting powerof which is owned by the corporation. Under the proposed regulations, a change in the effective control of acorporation is presumed to occur when either of the following events occurs:(a) Any one person, or more than one person acting as a group acquires(or has acquired during the 12 month period ending on the date of the mostrecent acquisition) ownership of stock of the corporation possessing 20percent or more of the total voting power of the stock of the corporation;or (b) a majority of the members of the corporation's board of directorsis replaced during any 12-month period by directors whose appointment orelection is not endorsed by a majority of the members of the corporation'sboard of directors prior to the appointment or election. Under the proposed regulations, a taxpayer may rebut the presumption describedin the preceding paragraph by establishing that such acquisition or acquisitionsof the corporation's stock, or such replacement of the majority of themembers of the corporation's board of directors, does not transfer thepower to control (directly or indirectly) the management and policies ofthe corporation from any one person or group to another person or group.<ITAG tagnum="84">Securities Violation Parachute Payments </ITAG>The proposed regulation implement section 280G(b)(2)(B) by providing thatthe term ``parachute payment'' also includes any payment in the natureof compensation to (or for the benefit of) a disqualified individual ifsuch payment is made (a) pursuant to an agreement that violates any generallyenforced Federal or State securities law or regulation, and (b) in connectionwith a potential or actual change in ownership or control. However, a violationwill not be taken into account for this purpose if it is merely technicalin character or is not materially prejudicial to shareholders or potentialshareholders. Generally, a securities violation will be presumed not toexist unless the existence of the violation has been determined or admittedin a civil or criminal action (or an administrative action by a regulatorybody charged with enforcing the particular securities law or regulation)which has been resolved by adjudication or consent. <ITAG tagnum="84">Reasonable Compensation </ITAG>As previously mentioned, section 280G(b)(4)(A) provides that except inthe case of securities violation parachute payments, the amount of a paymenttreated as a parachute payment shall not include the portion of such paymentwhich the taxpayer establishes by clear and convincing evidence is reasonablecompensation for personal services to be rendered on or after the dateof the change in ownership or control. Section 280G(b)(4)(B) provides that except in the case of securities violationparachute payments, the amount of a payment treated as an excess parachutepayment is reduced by any portion of the payment that the taxpayer establishesby clear and convincing evidence is reasonable compensation for personalservices actually rendered by the disqualified individual before the dateof the change in ownership or control. Such reasonable compensation isfirst offset against the portion of the base amount allocated to the payment.The proposed regulations provide criteria for determining whether paymentsare reasonable compensation. In general, whether payments are reasonablecompensation is determined on the basis of all the facts and circumstancesin the particular case. Factors relevant to such a determination includethe nature of the services rendered or to be rendered, the individual'shistoric compensation for performing such services, and the compensationof individuals performing comparable services in situations where the compensationis not contingent on the change. The proposed regulations also providethat payments made under certain nondiscriminatory employee plans or programswill generally be considered to be clear and convincing evidence that thepayments are reasonable compensation. Generally, clear and convincing evidence of reasonable compensation forpersonal services to be rendered on or after the change in ownership orcontrol will not exist if the individual does not, in fact, perform theservices. However, the proposed regulations provide that damages paid forthe breach of an employment contract may be reasonable compensation forsuch services if certain factors are shown. One of these factors is thatthe damages must be reduced by mitigation. For this purpose, damages willbe treated as being mitigated if the damages are reduced (or any paymentof such damages is returned) to the extent of the disqualified individual'searned income during the remainder of the contract term. The proposed regulationsdo not provide a rule concerning the method of establishing mitigationof damages in other situations, such as where the disqualified individualdoes not accept alternative employment during the remainder of the contractterm or where the individual and the corporation considered mitigationin determining the amount of a lump-sum settlement agreement, because theService is concerned about the administrability of such a rule. Accordingly,the Service solicits comment on how a rule which would allow damages tobe treated as mitigated in such cases could be administered.Finally, the proposed regulations provide that for purposes of section280G, severance payments will not be considered as reasonable compensation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Issues on Which Comments are Requested </ITAG>In addition to the issue concerning mitigation of damages, the Servicesolicits comment on the following issues: (a) How the present value of a payment to be made in the future shouldbe determined if such value depends on some uncertain future event or condition(and what adjustments, if any, are to be made if the amount of the actualpayment differs from the amount used in determining present value). SeeQ/A-31, Q/A-32, and Q/A-33 of the proposed regulations. (b) How the special rules of section 280G should interact with specialincome deferral rules such as those contained in section 83. See Q/A-12and Q/A-13 of the proposed regulations. (c) Whether the rules for identifying the disqualified individuals of acorporation (including the rules relating to the time period that shouldbe utilized to determine who the disqualified individuals are and how thecompensation for such a time period should be determined) could be simplified.See Q/A-20 and Q/A-21 of the proposed regulations. (d) How severance payments should be treated. See Q/A-44 of the proposedregulations. (e) Whether any of the rules contained in the proposed regulations shouldbe given only prospective effect. <ITAG tagnum="84">Special Analyses </ITAG>The Commissioner of Internal Revenue has determined that this proposedrule is not a major rule as defined in Executive Order 12291 and that aRegulatory Impact Analysis is therefore not required. Although this document is a notice of proposed rulemaking which solicitspublic comments, the Internal Revenue Service has concluded that the regulationsproposed herein are interpretative and that the notice and public procedurerequirements of 5 U.S.C. 553 do not apply. Accordingly, these proposedregulations do not constitute regulations subject to the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (5 U.S.C. Chapter 6). <ITAG tagnum="84">Comments and Requests for a Public Hearing </ITAG>Before these proposed regulations are adopted consideration will be givento any written comments that are submitted to the Commissioner of InternalRevenue. All comments will be available for public inspection and copying.A public hearing will be held upon written request to the Commissionerby any person who has submitted written comments. If a public hearing isheld, notice of the time and place will be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. <ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information </ITAG>The principal author of these proposed regulations is Stuart G. Wesslerof the Office of Chief Counsel, Internal Revenue Service.

A-1: Section 280G disallows a deduction for any ``excess parachute payment''paid or accrued. For rules relating to the imposition of a nondeductible20-percent excise tax on the recipient of any excess parachute payment,see Code sections 4999, 275(a)(6), and 3121(v)(2)(A). Q-2: What is a ``parachute payment'' for purposes of section 280G? A-2: (a) The term ``parachute payment'' means any payment (other than apayment with respect to certain corporations exempted under Q/A-6 of thissection, a payment under a qualified plan exempted under Q/A-8 of thissection, or a payment of reasonable compensation exempted under Q/A-9 ofthis section) that_ (1) Is in the nature of compensation; (2) Is made or is to be made to (or for the benefit of) a ``disqualifiedindividual;''(3) Is contingent on a change_(i) In the ownership of a corporation, (ii) In the effective control of a corporation, or (iii) In the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of a corporation;and (4) Has (together with other payments described in paragraph (a) (1), (2),and (3) of this A-2 with respect to the same disqualified individual) anaggregate present value of at least 3 times the individual's ``base amount.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Hereinafter, a change referred to in paragraph (a)(3) of this A-2is referred to as a ``change in ownership or control.'' For a discussionof the application of paragraph (a)(1), see Q/A-11 through Q/A-14; paragraph(a)(2), Q/A-l5 through Q/A-21; paragraph (a) (3), Q/A-22 through Q/A-29;and paragraph (a)(4), Q/A-30 through Q/A-36. (b) The term ``parachute payment'' also includes any payment in the natureof compensation to (or for the benefit of) a disqualified individual thatis pursuant to an agreement that violates a generally enforced securitieslaw or regulation. This type of parachute payment is referred to in thissection as a ``securities violation parachute payment.'' See Q/A-37 forthe definition and treatment of securities violation parachute payments.Q-3: What is an ``excess parachute payment'' for purposes of section 280G?A-3: The term ``excess parachute payment'' means an amount equal to theexcess of any parachute payment over the portion of the ``base amount''allocated to such payment. Subject to certain exceptions and limitations,an excess parachute payment is reduced by any portion of the payment whichthe taxpayer establishes by clear and convincing evidence is reasonablecompensation for personal services actually rendered by the disqualifiedindividual before the date of the change in ownership or control. For adiscussion of the computation of excess parachute payments and their reductionby reasonable compensation, see Q/A-38 through Q/A-44. For a discussionof the nonreduction of a securities violation parachute payment by reasonablecompensation, see Q/A-37. Q-4: What is the effective date of section 280G and this section? A-4: In general, section 280G and this section apply to payments underagreements entered into or renewed after June 14, 1984. Section 280G andthis section also apply to certain payments under agreements entered intoon or before June 14, 1984, and amended or supplemented in significantrelevant respect after that date. For a discussion of the application ofthe effective date, see Q/A-47 through Q/A-52. Exempt Payments Q-5: Are some types of payments exempt from the definition of the term``parachute payment''? A-5: Yes. The following four types of payments are exempt from the definitionof ``parachute payment'': (a) Payments with respect to a small businesscorporation (described in Q/A-6 of this section); (b) certain paymentswith respect to a corporation no stock in which is readily tradable onan established securities market (or otherwise) (described in Q/A-6 ofthis section); (c) payments to or from a qualified plan (described in Q/A-8of this section); and (d) certain payments of reasonable compensation (describedin Q/A-9 of this section). Deductions for payments exempt from the definitionof ``parachute payment'' are not disallowed by section 280G, and such exemptpayments are not subject to the 20-percent excise tax of section 4999.In addition, such exempt payments are not taken into account in applyingthe three-times-base-amount test of Q/A-30 of this section. Q-6: Which payments with respect to a corporation referred to in paragraph(a) or (b) of A-5 of this section are exempt from the definition of ``parachutepayment''? A-6: (a) The term ``parachute payment'' does not include_(1) Any payment to a disqualified individual with respect to a corporationwhich (immediately before the change in ownership or control) was a smallbusiness corporation (as defined in section 1361(b) but without regardto paragraph (1)(C) thereof), or (2) Any payment to a disqualified individual with respect to a corporation(other than a small business corporation described in paragraph (a)(1)of this A-6) if_(i) Immediately before the change in ownership or control, no stock insuch corporation was readily tradable on an established securities marketor otherwise, and (ii) The shareholder approval requirements described in Q/A-7 of this sectionare met with respect to such payment. (b) For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this A-6, the members of an affiliatedgroup are not treated as one corporation.(c) The requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this A-6 are not met ifa substantial portion of the assets of any entity consists (directly orindirectly) of stock in such corporation and any ownership interest insuch entity is readily tradable on an established securities market orotherwise. For this purpose, such stock constitutes a substantial portionof the assets of an entity if the total fair market value of the stockis equal to or more than one third of the total fair market value of allof the assets of the entity. If a corporation is a member of an affiliatedgroup (which group is treated as one corporation under A-46 of this section),the requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this A-6 are not met if anystock in any member of such group is readily tradable on an establishedsecurities market or otherwise. (d) For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this A-6, the term ``stock''does not include stock described in section 1504(a)(4) if the payment doesnot adversely affect the redemption and liquidation rights of any shareholderowning such stock. (e) For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this A-6, stock shall be treatedas readily tradable if it is regularly quoted by brokers or dealers makinga market in such stock. (f) For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this A-6, the term ``establishedsecurities market'' means an established securities market as defined inandSection; 1.897-1(m). (g) The following examples illustrate the application of this exemption:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1).</T3> A small business corporation (within the meaningof paragraph (a)(1) of this section) operates two businesses. The corporationsells the assets of one of its businesses, and these assets represent asubstantial portion of the assets of the corporation. Because of the sale,the corporation terminates its employment relationship with persons employedin the business the assets of which are sold. Several of these employeesare highly-compensated individuals to whom the owners of the corporationmake severance payments in excess of 3 times each employee's base amount.Since the corporation is a small business corporation immediately beforethe change in ownership or control, the payments are not parachute payments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2).</T3> Assume the same facts as in example (1), except thatthe corporation is not a small business corporation within the meaningof paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If no stock in the corporation isreadily tradable on an established securities market (or otherwise) immediatelybefore the change in ownership or control and the shareholder approvalrequirements described in Q/A-7 of this section are met, the payments arenot parachute payments. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (3).</T3> Seventy percent of the stock of Corporation S isowned by Corporation P, stock in which is readily tradable on an establishedsecurities market. The Corporation S stock represents a substantial portionof the assets of Corporation P. Corporation P sells all of its stock inCorporation S to Corporation X. Because of the sale, Corporation S makesseverance payments to several of its highly-compensated individuals inexcess of 3 times each individual's base amount. Since stock in CorporationP is readily tradable on an established securities market, the paymentsare not exempt from the definition of ``parachute payments'' under thisA-6.</ITAG>Q-7: How are the shareholder approval requirements referred to in paragraph(a)(2)(ii) of A-6 of this section met? A-7: (a) The shareholder approval requirements referred to in paragraph(a)(2)(ii) of A-6 of this section are met with respect to any payment if_(1) Such payment was approved by a separate vote of the persons who owned,immediately before the change in ownership or control, more than 75 percentof the voting power of all outstanding stock of the corporation, and (2) There was adequate disclosure, to all persons entitled to vote underparagraph (a)(1) of this A-7, of all material facts concerning all materialpayments which (but for Q/A-6 of this section) would be parachute paymentswith respect to a disqualified individual.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The vote described in paragraph (a)(1) of this A-7 must determinethe right of the disqualified individual to receive the payment, or, inthe case of a payment made before the vote, the right of the disqualifiedindividual to retain the payment. (b) Approval of a payment by any shareholder that is not an individual(``entity shareholder'') generally must be made by the person authorizedby the entity shareholder to approve the payment. However, if a substantialportion of the assets of an entity shareholder consists (directly or indirectly)of stock in the corporation undergoing the change in ownership or control,approval of the payment by that entity shareholder must be made by a separatevote of the persons who hold, immediately before the change in ownershipor control, more than 75 percent of the voting power of the entity shareholder.The preceding sentence does not apply if the value of the stock of thecorporation owned, directly or indirectly, by or for the entity shareholderdoes not exceed 1 percent of the total value of the outstanding stock ofthe corporation. Where approval of a payment by an entity shareholder mustbe made by a separate vote of the owners of the entity shareholder, thenormal voting rights of the entity shareholder determine which owners shallvote.(c) In determining the persons who comprise the ``more than 75 percent''group referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this A-7, stock is not countedas outstanding stock if the stock is actually owned or constructively ownedunder section 318(a) by or for a disqualified individual who receives (oris to receive) payments that would be parachute payments if the shareholderapproval requirements described in paragraph (a) of this A-7 were not met.Likewise, stock is not counted as outstanding stock if the owner is consideredunder section 318(a) to own any part of the stock owned directly or indirectlyby or for a disqualified individual described in the preceding sentence.However, if all persons who hold voting power in the corporation or theentity shareholder are disqualified individuals or related persons describedin either of the two preceding sentences, then stock owned by such personsis counted as outstanding stock. (d) To be adequate disclosure for purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of thisA-7, disclosure must be full and truthful disclosure of the material factsand such additional information as is necessary to make the disclosurenot materially misleading at the time the disclosure was made. An omittedfact is considered a material fact if there is a substantial likelihoodthat a reasonable shareholder would consider it important. (e) The following examples illustrate the application of this A-7:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>Corporation S has two shareholders_ Corporation P,which owns 76 percent of the stock of Corporation S, and A, an individual.No stock of Corporation P is readily tradable on an established securitiesmarket (or otherwise). Stock of Corporation S represents a substantialportion of the assets of Corporation P. All of the stock of CorporationS is sold to Corporation M. Contingent on the change in ownership of CorporationS, severance payments are made to the officers of Corporation S in excessof 3 times each officer's base amount. If the payments are approved bya separate vote of the persons who hold, immediately before the sale, morethan 75 percent of the voting power of the outstanding stock of CorporationP and the disclosure rules of paragraph  (a)(2) of this A-7 are compiledwith, the shareholder approval requirements of this A-7 are met, and thepayments are exempt from the definition of ``parachute payment'' pursuantto A-6 of this section. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>Corporation M is wholly owned by Partnership P, nointerest in which is readily tradable on an established securities market(or otherwise). Stock of Corporation M represents a substantial portionof the assets of Partnership P. Partnership P has one general partner and200 limited partners. None of the limited partners are entitled to voteon issues involving the management of the partnership investments. If thepayments are approved by the general partner and the disclosure rules ofparagraph (a)(2) of this A-7 are complied with, the shareholder approvalrequirements of this A-7 are met, and the payments are exempt from thedefinition of ``parachute payment'' pursuant to A-6 of this section.</ITAG>Q-8: Which payments under a qualified plan are exempt from the definitionof ``parachute payment''? A-8: The term ``parachute payment'' does not include any payment to orfrom_ (a) A plan described in section 401(a) which includes a trust exempt fromtax under section 501(a), (b) An annuity plan described in section 403(a), or (c) A simplified employee pension (as defined in section 408(k)). Q-9: Which payments of reasonable compensation are exempt from the definitionof ``parachute payment''? A-9: Except in the case of securities violation parachute payments, theterm ``parachute payment'' does not include any payment (or portion thereof)which the taxpayer establishes by clear and convincing evidence is reasonablecompensation for personal services to be rendered by the disqualified individualon or after the date of the change in ownership or control. See Q/A-38through Q/A-44 for rules on determining amounts of reasonable compensation.See Q/A-37 for the definition and treatment of securities violation parachutepayments. Payor of Parachute Payments Q-10: Who may be the payor of parachute payments? A-10: Parachute payments within the meaning of Q/A-2 of this section maybe paid directly or indirectly by the corporation referred to in paragraph(a)(3) of A-2 of this section, by a person acquiring ownership or effectivecontrol of that corporation or ownership of a substantial portion of thatcorporation's assets, or by any person whose relationship to such corporationor other person is such as to require attribution of stock ownership betweenthe parties under section 318(a). Payments in the Nature of Compensation Q-11: What types of payments are in the nature of compensation? A-11: (a) In general, for purposes of this section, all payments_in whateverform_are payments in the nature of compensation if they arise out of anemployment relationship or are associated with the performance of services.For this purpose, the performance of services includes holding oneselfout as available to perform services and refraining from performing services(such as under a covenant not to compete or similar arrangement). Paymentsin the nature of compensation include (but are not limited to) wages andsalary, bonuses, severance pay, fringe benefits, and pension benefits andother deferred compensation (including any amount characterized by theparties as interest thereon). However, payments in the nature of compensationdo not include attorney's fees or court costs paid or incurred in connectionwith the payment of any amount described in paragraph (a) (1), (2), and(3) of A-2 of this section.(b) Transfers of property are treated as payments for purposes of thisA-11. See Q/A-12 for rules on determining when such payments are consideredmade and the amount of such payments. See Q/A-13 for special rules on transfersof nonqualified stock options. Q-12: If a property transfer to a disqualified individual is a paymentin the nature of compensation, when is the payment considered made (orto be made), and how is the amount of the payment determined? A-12: (a) Except as provided in this A-12 and A-13 of this section, a transferof property is considered a payment made (or to be made) in the taxableyear in which the property transferred is includible in the gross incomeof the disqualified individual under section 83 and the regulations thereunder.Thus, in general, such a payment is considered made (or to be made) whenthe property is transferred (as defined in andSection; 1.83 3(a)) to thedisqualified individual and becomes substantially vested (as defined inandSection; 1.83-3(b)) in such individual. In such case, the amount of thepayment is determined under section 83 and the regulations thereunder.Thus, in general, the amount of the payment is equal to the excess of thefair market value of the transferred property (determined without regardto any lapse restriction, as defined in andSection; 1.83-3(i)) at the timethat the property becomes substantially vested, over the amount (if any)paid for the property. (b) An election made by a disqualified individual under section 83(b) withrespect to transferred property will not apply for purposes of this A-12.Thus, even if such an election is made with respect to a property transferthat is a payment in the nature of compensation, the payment is generallyconsidered made (or to be made) when the property is transferred to andbecomes substantially vested in such individual. (c) See Q/A-13 for rules on applying this A-12 to transfers of nonqualifiedstock options.<ITAG tagnum="21">(d) <T3>Example. </T3>On January 1, 1986, Corporation M gives to A, a disqualifiedindividual, in connection with his performance of services to CorporationM, a bonus of 100 shares of Corporation M stock. Under the terms of thebonus arrangement A is obligated to return the Corporation M stock to CcrporationM unless the earnings of Corporation M double by January 1, 1989, or thereis a change in ownership or control of Corporation M before that date.A's rights in the stock are treated as substantially nonvested (withinthe meaning of andSection; 1.83-3(b)) during that period because A's rightsin the stock are subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture (within themeaning of andSection; 1.83-3(c)) and are nontransferable (within the meaningof andSection; 1.83-3(d)). On January 1, 1988, a change in the ownershipof Corporation M occurs. On that day, the fair market value of the CorporationM stock is $250 per share. Since A's rights in the Corporation M stockbecome substantially vested (within the meaning of andSection; 1.83-3 (b))on that day, the payment is considered made on that day, and the amountof the payment for purposes of this section is equal to $25,000 (100 andmultiply;$250). See Q/A-39 for rules relating to the reduction of the excess parachutepayment by the portion of the payment which is established to be reasonablecompensation for personal services actually rendered before the date ofa change in ownership or control.</ITAG>Q-13: How are nonqualified stock options treated? A-13: (a) For purposes of this section, if an option to which section 42l(relating generally to certain qualified and other options) does not applyhas an ascertainable fair market value (whether or not readily ascertainableas defined in andSection; 1.83-7(b)) at the time the option becomes substantiallyvested (as defined in andSection; 1.83-3(b), the option shall be treatedas property that is transferred not later than the time at which the optionbecomes substantially vested. Thus, for purposes of this section, the vestingof such an option is treated as a payment in the nature of compensation.The value of an option with a readily ascertainable fair market value atthe time the option vests shall be determined by applying the rules setforth in andSection; 1.83-7(b). The value of an option with an ascertainablefair market value at the time the option vests is determined under allthe facts and circumstances in the particular case. Factors relevant tosuch a determination include, but are not limited to: (1) The differencebetween the option's exercise price and the value of the property subjectto the option the time of vesting; (2) the probability of the value ofsuch property increasing or decreasing; and (3) the length of the periodduring which the option can be exercised. See Q/A-33 for the treatmentof options the vesting of which is contingent on a change in ownershipor control and that do not have an ascertainable fair market value at thetime of vesting. (b) Any money or other property transferred to the disqualified individualupon the exercise, or as consideration upon the sale or other disposition,of an option described in paragraph (a) of this A-14 after the time suchoption vests is not treated as a payment in the nature of compensationto the disqualified individual under A-11 of this section. Nonetheless,the amount of the otherwise allowable deduction under section 162 or 212with respect to such transfer shall be reduced by the amount of the paymentdescribed in paragraph (a) of this section treated as an excess parachutepayment.(c) (The issue of whether an option to which section 421 applies will betreated as a payment for purposes of this section at the time of grantor at a later time is reserved for future regulations.) Q-14: Are payments in the nature of compensation reduced by considerationpaid by the disqualified individual? A-14: Yes. To the extent not otherwise taken into account under Q/A-12and  Q/A-13 of this section, the amount of any payment in the nature ofcompensation is reduced by the amount of any money or the fair market valueof any property (owned by the disqualified individual without restriction)that is (or will be) transferred by the disqualified individual in exchangefor the payment. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the fair marketvalue of property is determined as of the date the property is transferredby the disqualified individual. Disqualified Individuals Q-15: Who is a ``disqualified individual''? A-15: For purposes of this section, an individual is a disqualified individualwith respect to a corporation if, at any time during the ``disqualifiedindividual determination period'' (as defined in  Q/A-20 of this section),the individual is an employee or independent contractor of the corporationand is, with respect to the corporation_ (a) A shareholder (but see Q/A-17), (b) An officer (see Q/A-18), or (c) A highly-compensated individual (see Q/A-19). Q-16: Is a personal service corporation treated as an individual? A-16: (a) Yes. For purposes of this section, a personal service corporation(as defined in section 269A(b)(1)), or a noncorporate entity that wouldbe a personal service corporation if it were a corporation, is treatedas an individual. (b) Example. Corporation N, a personal service corporation (as definedin section 269A (b) (1)), has a single individual as its sole shareholderand employee. Corporation N performs personal services for CorporationM as an independent contractor. The compensation paid to Corporation Nby Corporation M puts Corporation N within the group of the highly-compensatedindividuals of Corporation M as determined under A-18 of this section.Hence, Corporation N is treated as a highly-compensated individual withrespect to Corporation M. Q-17: Are all shareholders of a corporation considered shareholders forpurposes of paragraph (a) of A-15 of this section?A-17: No. Only an individual who owns stock of a corporation having a fairmarket value that exceeds the lesser of $1 million, or 1 percent of thetotal fair market value of the outstanding shares of all classes of thecorporation's stock, is treated as a disqualified individual with respectto the corporation by reason of stock ownership. An individual who ownsa lesser amount of stock may, however, be a disqualified individual withrespect to the corporation by reason of being an officer or highly-compensatedindividual with respect to the corporation. For purposes of determiningthe amount of stock owned by an individual, the constructive ownershiprules of section 318(a) shall apply. Q-18: Who is an officer? A-18: (a) For purposes of this section, whether an individual is an officerwith respect to a corporation is determined upon the basis of all the factsand circumstances in the particular case (such as the source of the individual'sauthority, the term for which the individual is elected or appointed, andthe nature and extent of the individual's duties). Generally, the term``officer'' means an administrative executive who is in regular and continuedservice. The term ``officer'' implies continuity of service and excludesthose employed for a special and single transaction. An individual whomerely has the title of officer but not the authority of an officer isnot considered an officer for purposes of this section. Similarly, an individualwho does not have the title of officer but has the authority of an officeris an officer for purposes of this section. (b) An individual who is an officer with respect to any member of an affiliatedgroup that is treated as one corporation pursuant to Q/A-46 of this sectionis treated as an officer of such one corporation.(c) No more than 50 employees (or, if less, the greater of 3 employees,or 10 percent of the employees (rounded up to the nearest integer)) ofthe corporation (in the case of an affiliated group treated as one corporation,each member of the affiliated group) shall be treated as disqualified individualswith respect to a corporation by reason of being an officer of the corporation.For purposes of the preceding sentence, the number of employees of thecorporation is the greatest number of employees the corporation has duringthe disqualified individual determination period (as defined in Q/A-20of this section). If the number of officers of the corporation exceedsthe number of employees who may be treated as officers under the firstsentence of this paragraph (c), then the employees who are treated as officersfor purposes of this section are the highest paid 50 employees (or, ifless, the greater of 3 employees, or 10 percent of the employees (roundedup to the nearest integer)) of the corporation when ranked on the basisof compensation (as determined under Q/A-21 of this section) paid duringthe disqualified individual determination period. Q-19: Who is a ``highly-compensated individual''? A-19: (a) For purposes of this section, a ``highly compensated individual''with respect to a corporation is any individual who is, or would be ifthe individual were an employee, a member of the group consisting of thelesser of (1) the highest paid 1 percent of the employees of the corporation(rounded up to the nearest integer), or (2) the highest paid 250 employeesof the corporation, when ranked on the basis of compensation (as determinedunder Q/A-21 of this section) paid during the disqualified individual determinationperiod (as defined in Q/A-20 of this section). However, no individual whoseannualized compensation during the disqualified individual determinationperiod is less than $75,000 will be treated as a highly-compensated individual.(b) An individual who is not an employee of the corporation is not treatedas a highly-compensated individual with respect to the corporation on accountof compensation received for performing services (such as brokerage, legal,or investment banking services) in connection with a change in ownershipor control of the corporation, if the services are performed in the ordinarycourse of the individual's trade or business and the individual performssimilar services for a significant number of clients unrelated to the corporation.(c) In determining the total number of employees of a corporation for purposesof this A-19, employees are not counted if they normally work less than17\1/2\ hours per week (as defined in section 414(q)(8)(B) and the regulationsthereunder) or if they normally work during not more than 6 months duringany year (as defined in section 414(q)(8)(C) and the regulations thereunder).However, an employee who is not counted for purposes of the preceding sentencemay still be a highly-compensated individual. Q-20: What is the ``disqualified individual determination period''?A-20: (a) The ``disqualified individual determination period'' is the portionof the year of the corporation ending on the date of the change in ownershipor control of the corporation (the ``change in ownership period'') andthe twelve month period immediately preceding such change in ownershipperiod. For purpose of this A-20, a corporation may elect to use its taxableyear or the calendar year. For this purpose, the taxable year of an affiliatedgroup treated as one corporation pursuant to Q/A-46 of this section isthe taxable year of the common parent. (b) The provisions of this A-20 may be illustrated by the following examples:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>A change in ownership of Corporation M, a calendaryear corporation, takes place on June 12, 1988. The disqualified individualdetermination period of Corporation M begins on January 1, 1987 and endson June 12, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>Assume the same facts as example (1), except thatCorporation M is a fiscal year taxpayer with a taxable year ending on May31. Corporation M may elect as its disqualified individual determinationperiod either the period beginning on January 1, 1987, and ending on June12, 1988, or the period beginning on June 1, 1987, and ending on June 12,1988.</ITAG>Q-21: How is ``compensation'' defined? A-21: (a) For purposes of this section, the term ``compensation'' is thecompensation which was payable by the corporation with respect to whichthe change in ownership or control occurs (``changed corporation''), bya predecessor entity, or by a related entity. Such compensation shall bedetermined without regard to sections 125, 402(a)(8), and 402(h)(1)(B),and in the case of employer contributions made pursuant to a salary reductionagreement, without regard to section 403(b). Thus, for example, compensationincludes elective or salary reduction contributions to a cafeteria plan,cash or deferred arrangement or tax-sheltered annuity. (b) For purposes of this section, a ``predecessor entity'' is any entitywhich, as a result of a merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisitionof property or stock, corporate separation, or other similar business transactiontransfers some or all of its employees to the changed corporation or toa related entity or to a predecessor entity of the changed corporation.The term ``related entity'' includes: (1) All members of a controlled groupof corporations (as defined in section 414(b)) that includes the changedcorporation or a predecessor entity; (2) all trades or business (whetheror not incorporated) that are under common control (as defined in section4l4(c)) if such group includes the changed corporation or a predecessorentity; (3) all members of an affiliated service group (as defined in section414(m)) that includes the changed corporation or a predecessor entity;and (4) any other entities required to be aggregated with the changed corporationor a predecessor entity pursuant to section 414(o) and the regulationsthereunder (except leasing organizations as defined in section 414(n)).(c) For purposes of Q/A-18 and Q/A-19 of this section, compensation thatwas contingent on the change in ownership or control and that was payablein the year of the change shall not be treated as compensation. Contingent on Change in Ownership or Control Q-22: When is a payment ``contingent'' on a change in ownership or control?A-22: (a) In general, a payment is treated as ``contingent'' on a changein ownership or control if the payment would not, in fact, have been madehad no change in ownership or control occurred. A payment generally isto be treated as one which would not, in fact, have been made in the absenceof a change in ownership or control unless it is substantially certain,at the time of the change, that the payment would have been made whetheror not the change occurred. (But see Q/A-23 of this section regarding paymentsunder agreements entered into after a change in ownership or control.)Property that becomes substantially vested (as defined in andSection; 1.83-3(b))as a result of a change in ownership or control will not be treated asa payment which was substantially certain to have been made whether ornot the change occurred. (b) A payment is also generally treated as contingent on a change in ownershipor control if  (1) The payment is contingent on an event that is closely associated witha change in ownership or control, (2) a change in ownership or control actually occurs, and (3) the event is materially related to the change in ownership or control.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this A-22, a payment is treatedas contingent on an event that is closely associated with a change in ownershipor control unless it is substantially certain, at the time of the event,that the payment would have been made whether or not the event occurred.An event is considered closely associated with a change in ownership orcontrol if the event is of a type often preliminary or subsequent to, orotherwise closely associated with, a change in ownership or control. Forexample, the following events are considered closely associated with achange in the ownership or control of a corporation: The onset of a tenderoffer with respect to the corporation; a substantial increase in the marketprice of the corporation's stock that occurs within a short period (butonly if such increase occurs prior to a change in ownership or control);the cessation of the listing of the corporation's stock on an establishedsecurities market; the acquisition of more than 5 percent of the corporation'sstock by a person (or more than one person acting as a group) not in controlof the corporation; the voluntary or involuntary termination of the disqualifiedindividual's employment; and a significant reduction in the disqualifiedindividual's job responsibilities. Whether other events will be treatedas closely associated with a change in ownership or control will be basedon all the facts and circumstances of the particular case. For purposesof paragraph (b)(3) of this A-22, an event will be presumed to be materiallyrelated to a change in ownership or control if the event occurs withinthe period beginning one year before and ending one year after the dateof change in ownership or control. If such event occurs outside of theperiod beginning one year before and ending one year after the date ofchange in ownership or control. the event will be presumed not to be materiallyrelated to the change in ownership or control.(c) A payment that would in fact have been made had no change in ownershipor control occurred is treated as contingent on a change in ownership orcontrol if the change accelerates the time at which the payment is made.Thus, for example, if a change in ownership or control accelerates thetime of payment of vested deferred compensation, the payment may be treatedas contingent on the change. See Q/A-24 regarding the portion of a paymentthat is so treated. See also Q/A-8 regarding the exemption for certainpayments under qualified plans and Q/A-40 regarding treatment of a paymentas reasonable compensation. (d) A payment is treated as contingent on a change in ownership or controleven if the employment or independent contractor relationship of the disqualifiedindividual is not terminated (voluntarily or involuntarily) as a resultof the change. (e) The following examples illustrate the principles of this A-22:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1).</T3> A contract between a corporation and A, a disqualifiedindividual, provides that a payment will be made to A if his employmentwith the corporation is terminated at any time over the succeeding 3 years.Eighteen months later, a change in the ownership of the corporation occurs.Six months after the change in ownership, A's employment is terminatedand the payment is made to A. It was not substantially certain, at thetime of A's termination, that the payment would have been made had A'semployment not been terminated. Termination of employment is consideredclosely associated with a change in ownership or control. Because the terminationoccurred within one year after the date of the change in ownership thetermination of A's employment is presumed to be materially related to thechange in ownership. If this presumption is not rebutted, the payment willbe treated as contingent on the change in ownership. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2).</T3> A contract between a corporation and a disqualifiedindividual provides that a payment will be made to the individual uponthe onset of a tender offer for shares of the corporation's stock. A tenderoffer is made on December 1, 1988, and the payment is made to the disqualifiedindividual. Although the tender offer is unsuccessful, it leads to a negotiatedmerger with another entity on June 1, 1989, which results in a change inthe ownership of the corporation. It was not substantially certain, atthe time of the onset of the tender offer, that the payment would havebeen made had no tender offer taken place. The onset of a tender offeris considered closely associated with a change in ownership or control.Because the tender offer occurred within one year before the date of thechange in ownership of the corporation, the onset of the tender offer ispresumed to be materially related to the change in ownership. If this presumptionis not rebutted, the payment will be treated as contingent on the changein ownership. If no change in ownership or control had occurred, the paymentwould not be treated as contingent on a change in ownership or control;however, the payment still could be a parachute payment under Q/A-37 ofthis section if the contract violated a generally enforced securities lawor regulation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (3).</T3> A contract between a corporation and a disqualifiedindividual provides that a payment will be made to the individual if thecorporation's level of product sales or profits reaches a specified level.At the time the contract was entered into, the parties had no reason tobelieve that such an increase in the corporation's level of product salesor profits would be preliminary or subsequent to, or otherwise closelyassociated with, a change in ownership or control of the corporation. Eighteenmonths later, a change in the ownership of the corporation occurs and withinone year after the date of the change, the corporation's level of productsales or profits reaches the specified level. Under these facts and circumstances(and in the absence of contradictory evidence), the increase in productsales or profits of the corporation is not an event closely associatedwith the change in ownership or control of the corporation. Accordingly,even if the increase is materially related to the change, the payment willnot be treated as contingent on a change in ownership or control.</ITAG>Q-23: May a payment be treated as contingent on a change in ownership orcontrol if the payment is made under an agreement entered into after thechange? A-23: (a) No. Payments are not treated as contingent on a change in ownershipor control if they are made (or to be made) pursuant to an agreement enteredinto after the change. For this purpose, an agreement that is executedafter a change in ownership or control, pursuant to a legally enforceableagreement that was entered into before the change, will be considered tohave been entered into before the change. (See Q/A-9 regarding the exemptionfor reasonable compensation for services rendered on or after a changein ownership or control.) (b) The following examples illustrate the principles of this A-23:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1).</T3> Assume that a disqualified individual is an employeeof a corporation. A change in control of the corporation occurs, and thereafterthe individual enters into an employment agreement with the acquiring company.Since the agreement is entered into after the change in control occurs,payments to be made under agreement are not treated as contingent on thechange.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>Assume the same facts as in example (1), except thatthe agreement between the disqualified individual and the acquiring companyis executed after the change in control, pursuant to a legally enforceableagreement entered into before the change. Payments to be made under theagreement may be treated as contingent on the change in control pursuantto Q/A-22 of this section. However, see Q/A-9 regarding the exemption fromthe definition of parachute payment for certain amounts of reasonable compensation.</ITAG>Q-24: If a payment is treated as contingent on a change in ownership orcontrol, is the full amount of the payment so treated? A-24: (a) Generally, yes. However, in certain circumstances, describedin paragraphs (b) and (c) of this A-24, only a portion of the payment istreated as contingent on the change. (b) This paragraph (b) applies if it is substantially certain, at the timeof the change, that the payment would have been made whether or not thechange occurred, but the payment is treated as contingent on the changesolely because the change accelerates the time at which the payment ismade. In such case, the portion of the payment that is treated as contingenton the change in ownership or control is the amount by which the amountof the accelerated payment exceeds the present value of the payment absentthe acceleration. If the amount of such a payment absent the accelerationis not reasonably ascertainable, and the acceleration of the payment doesnot significantly increase the present value of the payment absent theacceleration, the present value of the payment absent the accelerationshall be treated as equal to the amount of the accelerated payment. Forrules on determining present value, see paragraph (d) of this A-24, andQ/A-32 and Q/A-33. (c)(1) This paragraph (c) applies in the case of a payment that is acceleratedby a change in ownership or control and that was substantially certain,at the time of the change, to have been made without regard to the changeif the disqualified individual had continued to perform services for thecorporation for a specified period of time. In such case, the portion ofthe payment that is treated as contingent on the change in ownership orcontrol is the lesser of (i) The amount of the accelerated payment; or (ii) The amount by which the amount of the accelerated payment exceedsthe present value of the payment that was expected to be made absent theacceleration (determined without regard to the risk of forfeiture for failureto continue to perform services), plus an amount, as determined in paragraph(c)(2) of this A-24, to reflect the lapse of the obligation to continueto perform services. If the value of the payment that was expected to be made absent the accelerationis not reasonably ascertainable, the future value of such payment shallbe deemed to be equal to the amount of the accelerated payment. (2) The amount reflecting the lapse of the obligation to continue to perfornservices (described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this A-24) will depend onall of the facts and circumstances. In no event, however, shall such amountbe less than 1 percent of the amount of the accelerated payment multipliedby the number of full months between the date that the individual's rightto receive the payment is not subject to any requirement or condition whichwould be treated as resulting in a substantial risk of forfeiture (withinthe meaning of andSection; 1.83-3(c)) and the date that, absent the accelerationthe individual's right to receive the payment would not have been subjectto any requirement or condition which would be treated as resuIting ina substantial risk of forfeiture. (d) For purposes of this A-24, the present value of a payment is determinedas of the date on which the accelerated payment is made. (e) The following examples illustrate the principles of this A-24:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>A corporation and a disqualified individual enterinto a contract providing that, if a change in the ownership or controlof the corporation occurs, all of the nonforfeitable deferred compensationthe individual has earned prior thereto will be paid immediately. The deferredcompensation otherwise will be paid when the individual reaches age 60.A change in the ownership of the corporation occurs, and the deferred compensationis immediately paid. Since the payment would have been made in any eventwhen the individual reached age 60, it is substantially certain, at thetime of the change, that the payments would have been made whether or notthe change occurred. The payment is treated as contingent on the changein ownership or control solely because the change accelerates the timeat which the payments are made. Therefore, the portion of the payment treatedas contingent on the change is the amount by which the amount of the acceleratedpayment (<T3>i.e., </T3>the amount paid to the individual because of the changein ownership or control) exceeds the present value of the payment absentthe acceleration (<T3>i.e., </T3>the value of the deferred compensation at the time of thechange in ownership or control, if the compensation had remained nonpayableuntil age 60). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>A corporation grants a stock appreciation right toa disqualified individual. After the stock appreciation right vests andbecomes exercisable, a change in the ownership of the corporation occurs,and the individual exercises the right. Neither the granting nor the vestingof the stock appreciation right was treated as a payment in the natureof compensation. Even if the change in ownership accelerates the time atwhich the right is exercised, no portion of the payment received upon exerciseof the right is treated as contingent on the change, since the amount ofthe accelerated payment does not exceed the present value of the paymentabsent the acceleration. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (3). </T3>As a result of a change in the effective controlof a corporation, a disqualified individual with respect to the corporationreceives payment of his vested account balance in a nonqualified individualaccount plan. Actual interest and other earnings on the plan assets arecredited to each account as earned and before distribution. Investmentof the plan assets is not restricted in such a manner as would preventthe earning of a market rate of return on the plan assets. The date onwhich the individual would have received his vested account balance absentthe change in control is uncertain, and the rate of earnings on the planassets is not fixed. Thus, the amount of the payment absent the accelerationis not reasonably ascertainable. Under these facts, acceleration of thepayment does not significantly increase the present value of the paymentabsent the acceleration, and the present value of the payment absent theacceleration shall be treated as equal to the amount of the acceleratedpayment. Accordingly, no portion of the payment is treated as contingenton the change. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (4). </T3>As a result of a change in the effective controlof a corporation, a disqualified individual with respect to the corporationreceives payment of the individual's vested benefits under a nonqualifiedpension plan which the individual otherwise would have received upon retirement.The amount of the benefits is not actuarially reduced to reflect its earlierpayment. The payment is treated as contingent on the change in controlsolely because the change accelerates the time at which the payment ismade. Therefore, the portion of the payment treated as contingent on thechange is the amount by which the amount of the accelerated payment exceedsthe present value of the payment absent the acceleration. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (5). </T3>On January 15, 1986, a corporation and a disqualifiedindividual enter into a contract providing for a cash payment of $500,000to be made to the individual on January 15, 1991. The payment is to beforfeited by the individual if he does not remain employed by the corporationfor the entire 5-year period. However, the full amount of the payment isto be made immediately upon a change in the ownership or control of thecorporation during the 5-year period. On January l5, 1989, a change inthe ownership of the corporation occurs and the full amount of the payment($500,000) is made on that date to the individual. Since the payment wouldhave been made in the absence of the change if the individual had continuedto perform services for the corporation until the end of the five yearperiod, it is substantially certain, at the time of the change, that thepayment would have been made in the absence of the change if the individualhad continued to perform services for the corporation for a specified periodof time. Therefore, only a portion of the payment is treated as contingenton the change. The portion of the payment that is treated as contingenton the change is the amount by which the amount of the accelerated payment(<T3>i.e., </T3>$500,000, the amount paid to the individual because of thechange in ownership) exceeds the present value of the payment that wasexpected to have been made absent the acceleration (<T3>i.e., </T3>$406,838, the present value on January 15, 1989, of a $500,000payment on January 15, 1991), plus an amount reflecting the lapse of theobligation to continue to perform services. Such amount will depend onall the facts and circumstances but in no event will such amount be lessthan $110,000 (1% andmultiply; 22 months andmultiply; $500,000). Accordingly,the minimum amount of the payment treated as contingent on the change inownership or control is $203,162 ($500,000^$406,838) + $110,000). Thisresult is not changed if the individual actually remains employed untilthe end of the 5-year period.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (6). </T3>(i) On January 15, 1986, a corporation gives to adisqualified individual, in connection with his performance of servicesto the corporation, a bonus of 1,000 shares of the corporation's stock.Under the terms of the bonus arrangement, the individual is obligated toreturn the stock to the corporation if she terminates her employment forany reason prior to January 15, 1991. However, if there is a change inthe ownership or effective control of the corporation prior to January15, 1991, she ceases to be obligated to return the stock. The individual'srights in the stock are treated as substantially nonvested (within themeaning of andSection; 1.83-3 (b)) during that period. On January 15, 1988,a change in the ownership of the corporation occurs. On that day, the fairmarket value of the stock is $500,000. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) Since the stock would have become substantially vested in theindividual in the absence of the change if she had continued to performservices for the corporation through January 15, 1991, it is substantiallycertain, at the time of the change, that the payment would have been madein the absence of the change if the individual had continued to performservices for the corporation for a specified period of time. Thus, onlya portion of the payment is treated as contingent on the change in ownershipor control. The portion of the payment that is treated as contingent onthe change is the amount by which the present value of the acceleratedpayment on January 15, 1989 ($500,000), exceeds the present value of thepayment that was expected to have been made on January 15, 1991, plus anamount reflecting the lapse of the obligation to continue to perform services.Assuming that, at the time of the change, it cannot be reasonably ascertainedwhat the value of the stock would been on January 15, 1991, the futurevalue of such stock on January 15, 1991, is deemed to be $500,000, theamount of the accelerated payment. The present value on January 15, 1989,of a $500,000 payment to be made on January 15, 1991, is $406,838. Thus,the portion of the payment treated as contingent on the change is $93,162($500,000 ^ $406,838), plus an amount reflecting the lapse of the obligationto continue to perform services. Such amount will depend on all the factsand circumstances but in no event will such amount be less than $110,000[1%andmultiply;22 months andmultiply; $500,000]. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (7). </T3>(i) On January 15, 1986, a corporation grants toa disqualified individual nonqualified stock options to purchase 30,000shares of the corporation's stock.

The options will be forfeited bythe individual if he fails to perform personal services for the corporationuntil January 15, 1989. The options will, however, substantially vest inthe individual at an earlier date if there is a change in ownership orcontrol of the corporation. On January 16, 1988, a change in the ownershipof the corporation occurs and the options become substantially vested inthe individual. On January 16, 1988, the options have an ascertainablefair market value of $600,000. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) At the time of the change, it is substantially certain that thepayment of the options to purchase 30,000 shares would have been made inthe absence of the change if the individual had continued to perform servicesfor the corporation until January 15, 1989. Therefore, only a portion ofthe payment is treated as contingent on the change. The portion of thepayment that is treated as contingent or the change is the amount by whichthe amount of the accelerated payment on January 16, 1988 ($600,000) exceedsthe present value on January 16, 1988, of the payment that was expectedto have been made on January 15, 1989, absent the acceleration, plus anamount: reflecting the lapse of the obligation to continue to perform services.Assuming that, at the time of the change, it cannot be reasonably ascertainedwhat the value of the options would have been on January 15, 1989, thevalue of such options on January 16, 1988, is deemed to be $600,000, theamount of the accelerated payment. The present value on January 16, 1988.of a $600,000 payment to be made on January 15, 1989, is $549,964.13. Thus,the portion of the payment treated as contingent on the change is $50,035.87($600,000 ^ $549,964.13), plus an amount reflecting the lapse of the obligationto continue to perform services, Such amount will depend on all the factsand circumstances but in no event will such amount be less than $60,000(1% andmultiply; 10 months andmultiply; $600,000). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (8). </T3>(i) The facts are the same as in example (7), exceptthat: the options become substantially vested periodically (absent a changein ownership of control), with one-third of the options vesting on January15, 1987, 1988, and 1989, respectively. Thus, options to purchase 20,000shares vest independently of the January 16, 1988, change in ownershipand the options to purchase the remaining 10,000 shares vest as a resultof the change. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) At the time of the change, it is substantially certain that thepayment of the options to purchase 10,000 shares would have been made withoutregard to the change if the individual had continued to perform servicesfor the corporation until January 15, 1989. Therefore, only a portion ofthe payment is treated as contingent on the change. The portion of thepayment that is treated as contingent on the change is the amount by whichthe amount of the accelerated payment on January 16, 1988 ($200,000) exceedsthe present value on January 16, 1988, of the payment that was expectedto have been made on January 15, 1989, absent the acceleration, plus anamount reflecting the lapse of the obligation to perform services.

The present value on January 16, 1988, of a$200,000 payment to be made on January 15, 1989, is $183,328.38. Thus,the portion of the payment treated as contingent on the change is $16,671.62($200,000 ^ $183,328.38), plus an amount reflecting the lapse of the obligationto continue to perform services.

In such case, the full amount of the payment, $600,000,is treated as contingent on the change because it was not substantiallycertain, at the time of the change, that the payment would have been madein the absence of the change if the individual had continued to performservices for the corporation for a specified period of time. See Q/A-39for rules relating to the reduction of the excess parachute payment bythe portion of the payment which is established to be reasonable compensationfor personal services actually rendered before the date of a change inownership or control. </ITAG>Presumption That Payment Is Contingent on Change Q-25: Is there a presumption that certain payments are contingent on achange in ownership or control? A-25: Yes. For purposes of this section, any payment pursuant to_(a) An agreement entered into within one year before the date of a changein ownership or control, or (b) An amendment that modifies a previous agreement in any significantrespect, if the amendment is made within one year before the date of achange in ownership or control, is presumed to be contingent on such changeunless the contrary is established by clear and convincing evidence. Inthe case of an amendment described in paragraph (b) of this A-25, onlythe portion of any payment that exceeds the amount of such payment thatwould have been made in the absence of the amendment is presumed, by reasonof the amendment, to be contingent on the change in ownership or control.Q-26: How may the presumption described in Q/A-25 of this section be rebutted?A-26: (a) To rebut the presumption described in Q/A-25 of this section,the taxpayer must establish by clear and convincing evidence that the paymentis not contingent on the change in ownership or control. Whether the paymentis contingent on such change is determined on the basis of all the factsand circumstances of the particular case. Factors relevant to such a determinationinclude, but are not limited to: (1) The content of the agreement or amendment;and (2) the circumstances surrounding the execution of the agreement oramendment, such as whether it was entered into at a time when a takeoverattempt had commenced and the degree of likelihood that a change in ownershipor control would actually occur. (b) In the case of an agreement described in paragraph (a) of A-25 of thissection, clear and convincing evidence that the agreement is one of thethree following types will generally rebut the presumption that paymentsunder the agreement are contingent on the change in ownership or control:(1) A ``nondiscriminatory employee plan or program'' as defined in paragraph(c) of this A-26; (2) A contract between a corporation and an individual that replaces aprior contract entered into by the same parties more than one year beforethe change in ownership or control, if the new contract does not providefor increased payments (apart from normal increases attributable to increasedresponsibilities or cost of living adjustments), accelerate the paymentof amounts due at a future time, or modify (to the individual's benefit)the terms or conditions under which payments will be made; or (3) A contract between a corporation and an individual who did not performservices for the corporation prior to the individual's taxable year inwhich the change in ownership or control occurs, if the contract does notprovide for payments that are significantly different in amount, timing,terms, or conditions from those provided under contracts entered into bythe corporation (other than contracts that themselves were entered intowithin one year before the change in ownership or control and in contemplationof the change) with individuals performing comparable services.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">However, even if the presumption is rebutted with respect to an agreement,payments under the agreement still may be contingent on the change in ownershipor control pursuant to Q/A-22 of this section. (c) For purposes of this section, the term ``nondiscriminatory employeeplan or program'' means: a group term life insurance plan that meets therequirements of section 79(d); an employee benefit plan that meets therequirements of section 89 (d) and (e); a self insured medical reimbursementplan that meets the requirements of section 105(h); a qualified group legalservices plan (within the meaning of section l20); a cafeteria plan (withinthe meaning of section 125); an educational assistance program (withinthe meaning of section 127); and a dependent care assistance program (withinthe meaning of section 129). Payments under certain other plans are exemptfrom the definition of ``parachute payment'' under Q/A-8 of this section.(d) The following examples illustrate the application of the presumption:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>A corporation and a disqualified individual who isan employee of the corporation enter into an employment contract. The contractreplaces a prior contract entered into by the same parties more than oneyear before the change and the new contract does not provide for any increasedpayments other than a cost of living adjustment, does not accelerate thepayment of amounts due at a future time, and does not modify (to the individual'sbenefit) the terms or conditions under which payments will be made. Clearand convincing evidence of these facts rebuts the presumption describedin A-25 of this section. However, payments under the contract still maybe contingent on the change in ownership or control pursuant to Q/A-22of this section. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>Assume the same facts as in example (1), except thatthe contract is entered into after a tender offer for the corporation'sstock had commenced and it was likely that a change in ownership wouldoccur and the contract provides for a substantial bonus payment to theindividual upon his signing the contract. The individual has performedservices for the corporation for many years, but previous employment contractsbetween the corporation and the individual did not provide for a similarsigning bonus. One month after the contract is entered into, a change inthe ownership of the corporation occurs. All payments under the contractare presumed to be contingent on the change in ownership even though thebonus payment would have been legally required even if no change had occurred.Clear and convincing evidence of these facts rebuts the presumption describedin A-25 of this section with respect to all of the payments under the contractwith the exception of the bonus payment (which is treated as contingenton the change). However, such payments under the contract still may becontingent on the change in ownership or control pursuant to Q/A-22 ofthis section. </ITAG>Change in Ownership or Control Q-27: When does a change in the ownership of a corporation occur? A-27: (a) For purposes of this section, a change in the ownership or controlof a corporation occurs on the date that any one person, or more than oneperson acting as a group, acquires ownership of stock of the corporationthat, together with stock held by such person or group, possesses morethan 50 percent of the total fair market value or total voting power ofthe stock of such corporation. However, if any one person, or more thanone person acting as a group, is considered to own more than 50 percentof the total fair market value or total voting power of the stock of acorporation, the acquisition of additional stock by the same person orpersons is not considered to cause a change in the ownership of the corporation(or to cause a change in the effective control of the corporation (withinthe meaning of Q/A-28 of this section)). An increase in the percentageof stock owned by any one person, or persons acting as a group, as a resultof a transaction in which the corporation acquires its stock in exchangefor property will be treated as an acquisition of stock for purposes ofthis section. (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this A-27, persons will not be consideredto be ``acting as a group'' merely because they happen to purchase or ownstock of the same corporation at the same time, or as a result of the samepublic offering. However, persons will be considered to be ``acting asa group'' if they are owners of an entity that enters into a merger, consolidation,purchase or acquisition of stock, or similar business transaction withthe corporation. (c) For purposes of this A-27, section 318(a) sha11 apply in determiningstock ownership. (d) The following examples illustrate the principles of this A-27:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>Corporation M has owned stock having a fair marketvalue equal to 19 percent of the value of the stock of Corporation N (anotherwise unrelated corporation) for many years prior to 1986. CorporationM acquires additional stock having a fair market value equal to 15 percentof the value of the stock of Corporation N on January 1, 1986, and an additional18 percent on February 21, 1987. As of February 21, 1987, Corporation Mhas acquired stock having a fair market value greater than 50 percent ofthe value of the stock of Corporation N. Thus, a change in the ownershipof Corporation N is considered to occur on February 21, 1987 (assumingthat Corporation M did not have effective control of Corporation N immediatelyprior to the acquisition on that date). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>All of the corporation's stock is owned by the foundersof the corporation. The board of directors of the corporation decides tooffer shares of the corporation to the public. After the public offering,the founders of the corporation own a total of 40 percent of the corporation'sstock, and members of the public own 60 percent. If no one person (or morethan one person acting as a group) owns more than 50 percent of the corporation'sstock (by value or voting power) after the public offering, there is nochange in the ownership of the corporation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (3). </T3>Corporation P merges into Corporation O (a previouslyunrelated corporation). In the merger, the shareholders of CorporationP receive Corporation O stock in exchange for their Corporation P stock.Immediately after the merger, the former shareholders of Corporation Pown stock having a fair market value equal to 60 percent of the value ofthe stock of Corporation O, and the former shareholders of CorporationO own stock having a fair market value equal to 40 percent of the valueof the stock of Corporation O. The former shareholders of Corporation Pwill be treated as ``acting as a group'' in their acquisition of CorporationO stock. Thus, a change in the ownership of Corporation O occurs on thedate of the merger. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (4). </T3>A, an individual, owns stock having a fair marketvalue equal to 20 percent of the value of the stock of Corporation Q. OnJanuary 1, 1987, Corporation Q acquires in a redemption for cash all ofthe stock held by shareholders other than A. Thus, A is left as the soleshareholder of Corporation O. A change in ownership of Corporation O isconsidered to occur on January 1, 1987 (assuming that A did not have effectivecontrol of Corporation Q immediately prior to the redemption). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (5). </T3>Assume the same facts as in example (4), except thatA owns stock having a fair market value equal to 51 percent of the valueof all the stock of Corporation Q immediately prior to the redemption.There is no change in the ownership of Corporation Q as a result of theredemption.</ITAG>Q-28: When does a change in the effective control of a corporation occur?A-28: (a) For purposes of this section, a change in the effective controlof a corporation is presumed to occur on the date that either_(1) Any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, acquires(or has acquired during the 12 month period ending on the date of the mostrecent acquisition by such person or persons) ownership of stock of thecorporation possessing 20 percent or more of the total voting power ofthe stock of such corporation; or (2) A majority of members of the corporation's board of directors is replacedduring any 12-month period by directors whose appointment or election isnot endorsed by a majority of the members of the corporation's board ofdirectors prior to the date of the appointment or election.This presumption may be rebutted by establishing that such acquisitionor acquisitions of the corporation's stock, or such replacement of themajority of the members of the corporation's board of directors, does nottransfer the power to control (directly or indirectly) the management andpolicies of the corporation from any one person (or more than one personacting as a group) to another person (or group). For purposes of this section,in the absence of an event described in paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of thisA-28, a change in the effective control of a corporation is presumed notto have occurred. (b) If any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, is consideredto effectively control a corporation (within the meaning of this A-28),the acquisition of additional control of the corporation by the same personor persons is not considered to cause a change in the effective controlof the corporation (or to cause a change in the ownership of the corporationwithin the meaning of Q/A-27 of this section). (c) For purposes of this A-28, persons will not be considered to be ``actingas a group'' merely because they happen to purchase or own stock of thesame corporation at the same time, or as a result of the same public offering.However, persons will be considered as ``acting as a group'' if they areowners of an entity that enters into a merger, consolidation, purchaseor acquisition of stock, or similar business transaction with the corporation.(d) Section 318(a) shall apply in determining stock ownership for purposesof this A-28. (e) The following examples illustrate the principles of this A-28:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>Shareholder A acquired the following percentagesof the voting stock of Corporation M (an otherwise unrelated corporation)on the following dates: 16 percent on January 1, 1985; 10 percent on January10, 1986; 8 percent on February 10, 1986; 11  percent on March 1, 1987;and 8 percent on March 10, 1987. Thus, on March 10, 1987, A owns a totalof 53 percent of M's voting stock. Since A did not acquire 20 percent ormore of M's voting stock during any 12-month period, there is no presumptionof a change in effective control pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this A-28.In addition, under these facts there is a presumption that no change inthe effective control of Corporation M occurred. If this presumption isnot rebutted (and thus no change in effective control of Corporation Mis treated as occurring prior to March 10, 1987), a change in the ownershipof Corporation M will be treated as having occurred on March 10, 1987 (pursuantto Q/A-27 of this section) since A had acquired more than 50 percent ofCorporation M's voting stock as of that date. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>A minority group of shareholders of a corporationopposes the practices and policies of the corporation's current board ofdirectors.

A change in the effectivecontrol of the corporation is presumed to have occurred on the date theelection of the new board of directors becomes effective.</ITAG>Q-29: When does a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of acorporation's assets occur? A-29: (a) For purposes of this section, a change in the ownership of asubstantial portion of a corporation's assets occurs on the date that anyone person, or more than one person acting as a group, acquires (or hasacquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recentacquisition by such person or persons) assets from the corporation thathave a total fair market value equal to or more than one third of the totalfair market value of all of the assets of the corporation immediately priorto such acquisition or acquisitions.(b) A transfer of assets by a corporation is not treated as a change inthe ownership of such assets if the assets are transferred to:  (1) A shareholder of the corporation (immediately before the asset transfer)in exchange for or with respect to its stock,  (2) An entity, 50 percent or more of the total value or voting power ofwhich is owned, directly or indirectly, by the corporation, (3) A person, or more than one person acting as a group, that owns, directlyor indirectly, 50 percent or more of the total value or voting power ofall the outstanding stock of the corporation, or (4) An entity, at least 50 percent of the total value or voting power isowned, directly or indirectly, by a person described in paragraph (b)(3)of this A-29. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">For purposes of this paragraph (b) and except as otherwise provided,a person's status is determined immediately after the transfer of the assets.For example, a transfer of assets pursuant to a complete liquidation ofa corporation, a redemption of a shareholder's interest, or a transferto a majority-owned subsidiary of the corporation is not treated as a changein the ownership of the assets of the transferor corporation. (c) For purposes of this A-29, section 318(a) shall apply in determiningstock ownership. (d) The following examples illustrate the principles of this A-29:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>Corporation M acquires assets having a fair marketvalue of $500,000 from Corporation N (an unrelated corporation) on January1, 1986. The total fair market value of Corporation N's assets immediatelyprior to the acquisition was $3 million. Since the value of the assetsacquired by Corporation M is less than one-third of the fair market valueof Corporation N's total assets immediately prior to the acquisition, theacquisition does not represent a change in the ownership of a substantialportion of Corporation N's assets. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>Assume the same facts as in example (1). Also assumethat on November 1, 1986, Corporation M acquires from Corporation N additionalassets having a fair market value of $700,000. Thus, Corporation M hasacquired from Corporation N assets worth a total of $1.2 million duringthe 12-month period ending on November 1, 1986. Since $1.2 million is morethan one-third of the total fair market value of all of Corporation N'sassets immediately prior to the earlier of these acquisitions ($3 million),a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of Corporation N's assetsis considered to have occurred on November 1, 1986. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (3). </T3>All of the assets of Corporation P are transferredto Corporation O (an unrelated corporation). In exchange, the shareholdersof Corporation P receive Corporation O stock. Immediately after the transfer,the former shareholders of Corporation P own 60 percent of the fair marketvalue of the outstanding stock of Corporation O and the former shareholdersof Corporation O own 40 percent of the fair market value of the outstandingstock of Corporation O. Because Corporation O is an entity more than 50percent of the fair market value of the outstanding stock of which is ownedby the former shareholders of Corporation P, the transfer of assets isnot treated as a change in ownership of a substantial portion of the assetsof Corporation P. </ITAG>``Three-Times-Base-Amount Test'' for Parachute Payments Q-30: Are all payments that are in the nature of compensation, are madeto a disqualified individual, and are contingent on a change in ownershipor control, parachute payments? A-30: (a) No. To determine whether such payments are parachute payments,they must be tested against the individual's ``base amount'' (as definedin Q/A-34 of this section). To do this, the aggregate present value ofall payments in the nature of compensation that are made or to be madeto (or for the benefit of) the same disqualified individual and are contingenton the change in ownership or control must be determined. If this aggregatepresent value equals or exceeds the amount equal to 3 times the individual'sbase amount, the payments are parachute payments. If this aggregate presentvalue is less than the amount equal to 3 times the individual's base amount,no portion of the payments is a parachute payment. See Q/A-31, Q/A-32,and Q/A-33 for rules on determining present value. Parachute payments thatare securities violation parachute payments are not included in the foregoingcomputation if they are not contingent on a change in ownership or control.See Q/A-37 for the definition and treatment of securities violation parachutepayments.(b) The following examples illustrate the principles of this A-30:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>A is a disqualified individual with respect to CorporationM. A's base amount is $100,000. Payments totalling $400,000 that are inthe nature of compensation and contingent on a change in the ownershipof Corporation M are made to A on the date of the change. The paymentsare parachute payments since they have an aggregate present value at leastequal to 3 times A's base amount of $100,000 (3 andmultiply; $100,000 = $300,000).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>ExampIe (2). </T3>Assume the same facts as in exampIe (1), except thatthe payments contingent on the change in the ownership of Corporation Mtotal $290,000. Since the payments do not have an aggregate present valueat least equal to 3 times A's base amount, no portion of the payments isa parachute payment.</ITAG>Q-31: As of what date is the present value of a payment determined? A-31: Except as provided in this section, the present value of a paymentis determined as of the date on which the change in ownership or controIoccurs, or, if a payment is made prior to such date, the date on whichthe payment is made. Q-32: What discount rate is to be used to determine present value? A-32: For purposes of this section, present value generally is determinedby using a discount rate equal to 120 percent of the applicable Federalrate (determined under section 1274(d) and the regulations thereunder)compounded semiannually. The applicable Federal rate to be used for thispurpose is the Federal rate that is in effect on the date as of which thepresent value is determined. See Q/As 24 and 35. However, for any payment,the corporation and the disqualified individual may elect to use the applicableFederal rate that is in effect on the date that the contract which providesfor the payment is entered into, if such election is made in the contract.Q-33: If the present value of a payment to be made in the future is contingenton an uncertain future event or condition, how is the present vaIue ofthe payment determined? A-33: (a) In certain cases, it may be necessary to apply the 3-times-base-amounttest of Q/A-30 of this section or to allocate a portion of the base amountto a payment described in paragraph (a) (1), (2), and (3) of A-2 of thissection at a time when the aggregate present value of all such paymentscannot be determined with certainty because the time, amount, or rightto receive one or more such payments is contingent on the occurrence ofan uncertain future event or condition. For example, a disqualified individual'sright to receive a payment may be contingent on the involuntary terminationof such individual's employment with the corporation. In such a case, areasonable estimate of the time and amount of the future payment shallbe made, and the present value of the payment will be determined on thebasis of this estimate. For purposes of making this estimate, an uncertainfuture event or condition that may reduce the present value of a paymentwill be taken into account only if the possibility of the occurrence ofthe event or condition can be determined on the basis of generally acceptedactuarial principles or can be otherwise estimated with reasonable accuracy.(b) Whenever a payment described in paragraph (a) of this A-33 is actuallymade or becomes certain not to be made, the 3-times-base-amount test describedin Q/A-30 of this section shall be reapplied (and the portion of the baseamount allocated to previous payments shall be reallocated (if necessary)to such payments) to reflect the actual time and amount of the payment.Whenever the 3-times-base-amount test is applied (or whenever the baseamount is allocated), the aggregate present value of the payments receivedor to be received by the disqualified individual is redetermined as ofthe date described in A-31 of this section, using the discount rate describedin A-32 of this section. This redetermination may affect the amount ofany excess parachute payment for a prior taxable year.(c) The following examples illustrate the principles of this A-33:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>A, a disqualified individual with respect to CorporationM, has a base amount of $100,000. Under his employment agreement with CorporationM, A is entitled to receive a payment in the nature of compensation inthe amount of $250,000 contingent on a change in the ownership of CorporationM. In addition, the agreement provides that if A's employment is terminatedwithin 1 year after the change in ownership, A will receive an additionalpayment in the nature of compensation in the amount of $150,000, payable1 year after the date of the change in ownership. A and Corporation M arecalendar year taxpayers. A change in the ownership of Corporation M occursand A receives the first payment of $250,000. At the time Corporation Mfiles its income tax return for the year of the change in ownership, itreasonably estimates that there is a 50-percent probability that, as aresult of the change, A's employment will be terminated within 1 year ofthe date of the change. For purposes of applying the 3-times-base-amounttest (and if the first payment is determined to be a parachute payment,for purposes of allocating a portion of A's base amount to that payment),Corporation M shall assume that an additional payment of $75,000 (.5 andmultiply;$150,000)will be made to A as a result of the change in ownership. The present valueof the additional payment is determined under Q/A-31 and Q/A-32 of thissection. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>B, a disqualified individual with respect to CorporationN, has a base amount of $100,000. Under her employment agreement with CorporationN, B is entitled to receive payments in the nature of compensation in theamount of $20,000 per month for a period of 24 months if B terminates employmentwith Corporation N as a result of a change in ownership of CorporationN. Such monthly payments are to be reduced by the amount of any compensationearned by B from unrelated employers during the 24-month period. B andCorporation N are calendar year taxpayers. On June 1, 1988, there is achange in the ownership of Corporation N. As a result of the change, Bvoluntarily terminates employment with Corporation N and begins to receivemonthly payments under the agreement. Assume that the present value, determinedas of June 1, 1988, of a stream of 24-monthly payments of $20,000, is $438,134.At the time Corporation N files its income tax return for 1988, it cannotbe determined with reasonable accuracy whether B will earn any compensationfrom unrelated employers during the 24-month period. Accordingly, the presentvalue of the payments to be received by B ($438,134) exceeds 3 times B'sbase amount ($300,000) and a portion of each of the 1988 payments willbe treated as an excess parachute payment for the 1988 taxable year. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (3). </T3>Assume the same facts as in example (2), except thatin April 1989 B becomes employed by an employer unrelated to CorporationN. At the time Corporation N files its income tax return for 1989, it hasbecome certain that, due to the compensation earned by B from unrelatedemployers, the present value, determined as of June 1, 1988, of the streamof payments from Corporation N will not exceed $192,060. Because it hasbeen redetermined that the present value of the payments received or tobe received by B does not equal or exceed 3 times B's base amount, no portionof the payments made in 1988 or 1989 will be treated as excess parachutepayments.</ITAG>Q-34: What is the ``base amount''? A-34: (a) The base amount of a disqualified individual is the average annualcompensation (as defined in Q/A-21 of this section) which was includablein the gross income of such individual for taxable years in the ``baseperiod'' (or either was excludable from such gross income as ``foreignearned income'' within the meaning of section 911, or would have been includablein such gross income if such person had been a United States citizen orresident.) See Q/A-35 for the definition of ``base period'' and for examplesof base amount computations. (b) If the base period of a disqualified individual includes a short taxableyear or less than all of a taxable year, compensation for such short orincomplete taxable year must be annualized before determining the averageannual compensation for the base period. In annualizing compensation, thefrequency with which payments are expected to be made over an annual periodmust be taken into account. Thus, any amount of compensation for such ashort or incomplete taxable year that represents a payment that will notbe made more often than once per year is not annualized. (c) Because the base amount includes only compensation that is includablein gross income, the base amount does not include certain items that constituteparachute payments. For example, payments in the form of untaxed fringebenefits are not included in the base amount but may be treated as parachutepayments.Q-35: What is the ``base period''? A-35: (a) The ``base period'' of a disqualified individual is the mostrecent 5 taxable years of the individual ending before the date of thechange in ownership or control. However, if the disqualified individualwas not an employee or independent contractor of the corporation with respectto which the change in ownership or control occurs (or a predecessor entityor a related entity as defined in A-21 of this section) for this entire5-year period, the individual's base period is the portion of such 5-yearperiod during which the individual performed personal services for thecorporation or predecessor entity or related entity. (b) The following examples illustrate the principles of Q/A-34 of thissection and this Q/A-35:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1).</T3> A disqualified individual was employed by a corporationfor 2 years and 4 months preceding his taxable year in which a change inownership or control of the corporation occurs. The individual's includiblecompensation income from the corporation was $30,000 for the 4-month period,$120,000 for the first full year, and $150,000 for the second full year.The individual's base amount is $120,000</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">  ((3 andmultiply; $30,000) + $120,000 + $150,000) andCx.1; 3.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2).</T3> Assume the same facts as in example (1), except thatthe individual also received a $60,000 ``sign-up'' bonus when his employmentwith the corporation commenced at the beginning of the 4-month period.The individual's base amount is $140,000</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">(($60,000 + (3 andmultiply; $30,000)) + $120,000 + $150,000) andCx.1;3.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">Since the bonus will not be paid more often than once per year, theamount of the bonus is not increased in annualizing the individual's compensationfor the 4-month period.</ITAG>Q-36: How is the base amount determined in the case of a disqualified individualwho did not perform services for the corporation (or a predecessor entityor a related entity as defined in A-21 of this section), prior to the individual'staxable year in which the change in ownership or control occurs? A-36: (a) In such a case, the individual's base amount is the annualizedcompensation (as defined in Q/A-21 of this section) which_(1) Was includible in the individual's gross income for that portion, priorto such change, of the individual's taxable year in which the change occurred(or either was excludible from such gross income as ``foreign earned income''within the meaning of section 911, or would have includible in such grossincome if such person had been a United States citizen or resident), (2) Was not contingent on the change in ownership or control, and (3) Was not a securities violation parachute payment. (b) The following examples illustrate the principles of this A-36:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1).</T3> On January 1, 1986, A, an individual whose taxableyear is the calendar year, enters into a 4-year employment contract withCorporation M as an officer of the corporation. A has not previously performedservices for Corporation M (or any predecessor entity or related entityas defined in A-21 of this section). Under the employment contract, A isto receive an annual salary of $120,000 for each of the 4 years that heremains employed by Corporation M with any remaining unpaid balance tobe paid immediately in the event that A's employment is terminated withoutcause. On July 1, 1986, after A has received compensation of $60,000, achange in the ownership of Corporation M occurs. Because of the change,A's employment is terminated without cause, and he receives a payment of$420,000. It is established by clear and convincing evidence that the $60,000in compensation is not contingent on the change in ownership or control,but the presumption of Q/A-25 of this section is not rebutted with respectto the $420,000 payment. Thus, the payment of $420,000 is treated as contingenton the change in ownership of Corporation M. In this case, A's base amountis $120,000 (2 andmultiply; $60,000). Since the present value of the paymentwhich is contingent on the change in ownership of Corporation M ($420,000)is more than 3 times A's base amount of $120,000 (3 andmultiply; $120,000= $360,000), the payment is a parachute payment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2).</T3> Assume the same facts as in example (1), except thatA also receives a ``sign-up'' bonus of $50,000 from Corporation M on January1, 1986. It is established by clear and convincing evidence that the bonusis not contingent on the change in ownership. When the change in ownershipoccurs on July 1, 1986, A has received compensation of $110,000 (the $50,000bonus plus $60,000 in salary). In this case, A's base amount is $170,000[$50,000 + (2 andmultiply; $60,000)]. Since the $50,000 bonus will not bepaid more than once per year, the amount of the bonus is not increasedin annualizing A's compensation. The present value of the potential parachutepayment ($420,000) is less than 3 times A's base amount of $170,000 (3andmultiply; $170,000 = $510,000), and therefore no portion of the paymentis a parachute payment.</ITAG>Securities Violation Parachute Payments Q-37: Must a payment be contingent on a change in ownership or controlin order to be a parachute payment? A-37: (a) No. The term ``parachute payment'' also includes any payment(other than a payment exempted under Q/A-6 or Q/A-8 of this section) thatis in the nature of compensation and is to (or for the benefit of) a disqualifiedindividual, if such payment is made or to be made_ (1) Pursuant to an agreement that violates any generally enforced Federalor State securities laws or regulations, and (2) In connection with a potential or actual change in ownership or control.A violation is not taken into account under paragraph (a)(1) of this A-37if it is merely technical in character or is not materially prejudicialto shareholders or potential shareholders. Moreover, a violation will bepresumed not to exist unless the existence of the violation has been determinedor admitted in a civil or criminal action (or an administrative actionby a regulatory body charged with enforcing the particular securities lawor regulation) which has been resolved by adjudication or consent. Parachutepayments described in this A-37 are referred to in this section as ``securitiesviolation parachute payments.'' (b) Securities violation parachute payments that are not contingent ona change in ownership or control within the meaning of Q/A-22 of this sectionare not taken into account in applying the 3-times-base-amount test ofQ/A-30 of this section. Such payments are considered parachute paymentsregardless of whether such test is met with respect to the disqualifiedindividual. Moreover, the amount of a securities violation parachute paymenttreated as an excess parachute payment shall not be reduced by the portionof such payment that is reasonable compensation for personal services actuallyrendered before the date of a change in ownership or control if such paymentis not contingent on such change. Likewise, the amount of a securitiesviolation parachute payment shall include the portion of such payment thatis reasonable compensation for personal services to be rendered on or afterthe date of a change in ownership or control if such payment is not contingenton such change. (c) The rules in paragraph (b) of this A-37 also apply to securities violationparachute payments that are contingent on a change in ownership or controlif the application of these rules results in greater total excess parachutepayments with respect to the disqualified individual than would resultif the payments were treated simply as payments contingent on a changein ownership or control (and hence were taken into account in applyingthe 3-times-base-amount test and were reduced by, or did not include, anyapplicable amount of reasonable compensation). (d) The following examples illustrate the principles of this A-37:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>A, a disqualified individual with respect to CorporationM, receives two payments in the nature of compensation that are contingenton a change in the ownership or control of Corporation M. The present valueof the first payment is equal to A's base amount and is not a securitiesviolation parachute payment. The present value of the second payment isequal to 1.5 times A's base amount and is a securities violation parachutepayment. Neither payment includes any reasonable compensation. If the secondpayment is treated simply as a payment contingent on a change in ownershipor control, the amount of A's total excess parachute payments is zero becausethe aggregate present value of the payments does not equal or exceed 3times A's base amount. If the second payment is treated as a securitiesviolation parachute payment subject to the rules of paragraph (b) of thisA-37, the amount of A's total excess parachute payments is 0.5 times A'sbase amount. Thus, the second payment is treated as a securities violationparachute payment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>Assume the same facts as in example (1), except thatthe present value of the first payment is equal to 2 times A's base amount.If the second payment is treated simply as a payment contingent on a changein ownership or control, the total present value of the payments is 3.5times A's base amount, and the amount: of A's total excess parachute paymentsis 2.5 times A's base amount. If the second payment is treated as a securitiesviolation parachute payment, the amount of A's total excess parachute paymentsis 0.5 times A's base amount. Thus, the second payment is treated simplyas a payment contingent on a change in ownership or control.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (3). </T3>B, a disqualified individual with respect to CorporationN, receives two payments in the nature of compensation that are contingenton a change in the control of Corporation N. The present value of the firstpayment is equal to 4 times B's base amount and is a securities violationparachute payment. The present value of the second payment is equal to2 times B's base amount and is not a securities violation parachute payment.B establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the entire amount ofthe first payment is reasonable compensation for personal services to berendered after the change in control. If the first payment is treated simplyas a payment contingent on a change in ownership or control, it is exemptfrom the definition of ``parachute payment'' pursuant to Q/A-9 of thissection. Thus, the amount of B's total excess parachute payment is zerobecause the present value of the second payment does not equal or exceedthree times B's base amount. However, if the first payment is treated asa securities violation parachute payment, the amount of B's total excessparachute payments is 3 times B's base amount. Thus, the first paymentis treated as a securities violation parachute payment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (4). </T3>Assume the same facts as in example (3), except thatB does not receive the second payment and B establishes by clear and convincingevidence that the first payment is reasonable compensation for servicesactually rendered before the change in the control of Corporation N. Ifthe payment is treated simply as a payment contingent on a change in ownershipor control, the amount of B's excess parachute payment is zero becausethe amount treated as an excess parachute payment is reduced by the amountthat B establishes as reasonable compensation. However, if the paymentis treated as a securities violation parachute payment, the amount of B'sexcess parachute payment is 3 times B's base amount. Thus, the paymentis treated as a securities violation parachute payment.</ITAG>Computation and Reduction of Excess Parachute Payments Q-38: How is the amount of an excess parachute payment computed? A-38: (a) The amount of an excess parachute payment is the excess of theamount of any parachute payment over the portion of the disqualified individual'sbase amount that is allocated to such payment. For this purpose, the portionof the base amount allocated to any parachute payment is the amount thatbears the same ratio to the base amount as the present value of such parachutepayment bears to the aggregate present value of all parachute paymentsmade or to be made to (or for the benefit of) the same disqualified individual.Thus, the portion of the base amount allocated to any parachute paymentis determined by multiplying the base amount by a fraction, the numeratorof which is the present value of such parachute payment and the denominatorof which is the aggregate present value of all such payments. See Q/A-31,Q/A-32, and Q/A-33 for rules on determining present value and Q/A-34 forthe definition of ``base amount''.<ITAG tagnum="21">(b) <T3>Example. </T3>An individual with a base amount of $100,000 is entitledto receive two parachute payments, one of $200,000 and the other of $400,000.The $200,000 payment is made at the time of the change in ownership orcontrol, and the $400,000 payment is to be made at a future date. The presentvalue of the $400,000 payment is $300,000 on the date of the change inownership or control. The portions of the base amount allocated to thesepayments are $40,000 (($200,000/$500,000) andmultiply; $100,000) and $60,000(($300,000/$500,000) andmultiply; $100,000), respectively. Thus, the amountof the first excess parachute payment is $160,000 ($200,000^$40,000) andthat of the second is $340,000 ($400,000^$60,000).</ITAG>Q-39: May the amount of an excess parachute payment be reduced by reasonablecompensation for personal services actually rendered before the changein ownership or control? A-39: (a) Generally, yes. Except in the case of payments treated as securitiesviolation parachute payments, the amount of an excess parachute paymentis reduced by any portion of the payment that the taxpayer establishesby clear and convincing evidence is reasonable compensation for personalservices actually rendered by the disqualified individual before the dateof the change in ownership or control. Services reasonably compensatedfor by payments that are not parachute payments (either because the paymentsare not contingent on a change in ownership or control and are not securitiesviolation parachute payments, or because the payments are made pursuantto a contract entered into before June 15, 1984, which has not been renewed,or amended or supplemented in significant relevant respect after June 14,1984) are not taken into account for this purpose. The portion of any parachutepayment that is established as reasonable compensation is first reducedby the portion of the disqualified individual's base amount that is allocatedto such parachute payment; any remaining portion of the parachute paymentestablished as reasonable compensation then reduces the excess parachutepayment. (b) Reasonable compensation for personal services to be rendered by thedisqualified individual on or after the date of the change in ownershipor control is exempt from the definition of ``parachute payment'' pursuantto Q/A-9 of this section. For rules on determining amounts of reasonablecompensation, see Q/A-40 through Q/A-43. (c) The following examples illustrate the principles of this A-39:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>Assume that a parachute payment of $600,000 is madeto a disqualified individual, and the portion of the individual's baseamount that is allocated to the parachute payment is $100,000. Also assumethat $300,000 of the $600,000 parachute payment is established as reasonablecompensation for personal services actually rendered by the disqualifiedindividual before the date of the change in ownership or control. Beforethe reasonable compensation is taken into account, the amount of the excessparachute payment is $500,000 ($600,000^$100,000). In reducing the excessparachute payment by reasonable compensation, the portion of the parachutepayment that is established as reasonable compensation ($300,000) is firstreduced by the portion of the disqualified individual's base amount thatis allocated to the parachute payment ($100,000), and the remainder ($200,000)then reduces the excess parachute payment. Thus, in this case, the excessparachute payment of $500,000 is reduced by $200,000 of reasonable compensation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>Assume the same facts as in example (1), except thatthe full amount of the $600,000 parachute payment is established as reasonablecompensation. In this case, the excess parachute payment of $500,000 isreduced to zero by $500,000 of reasonable compensation. As a result, noportion of any deduction for the payment is disallowed by section 280G,and no portion of the payment is subject to the 20-percent excise tax ofsection 4999.</ITAG>Determination of Reasonable Compensation Q-40: How is it determined whether payments are reasonable compensation?A-40: In general, whether payments are reasonable compensation for personalservices actually rendered, or to be rendered, by the disqualified individualis determined on the basis of all the facts and circumstances of the particularcase. Factors relevant to such a determination include, but are not limitedto, the following: (a) The nature of the services rendered or to be rendered; (b) The individual's historic compensation for performing such services;and (c) The compensation of individuals performing comparable services in situationswhere the compensation is not contingent on a change in ownership or control.Q-41: Is any particular type of evidence generally considered clear andconvincing evidence of reasonable compensation for personal services? A-41: Yes. A showing that payments are made under a nondiscriminatory employeeplan or program (as defined in Q/A-26 of this section) generally is consideredto be clear and convincing evidence that the payments are reasonable compensation.This is true whether the personal services for which the payments are madeare actually rendered before, or to be rendered on or after, the date ofthe change in ownership or control. Q/A-46 of this section (relating tothe treatment of an affiliated group as one corporation) does not applyfor purposes of this A-41. No determination of reasonable compensationis needed in order for payments under qualified plans to be exempt fromthe definition of ``parachute payment'' under Q/A-8 of this section. Q-42: Is any particular type of evidence generally considered clear andconvincing evidence of reasonable compensation for personal services tobe rendered on or after the date of a change in ownership or control?A-42: (a) Yes. If payments are made or to be made to (or on behalf of)a disqualified individual for personal services to be rendered on or afterthe date of a change in ownership or control, a showing that (1) The payments were made or are to be made only for the period the individualactually performs such personal services, and (2) The individual's annual compensation for such services is not significantlygreater than such individual's annual compensation prior to the changein ownership or control, apart from normal increase attributable to increasedresponsibilities or cost of living adjustments (or is not significantlygreater than the annual compensation customarily paid by the employer orby comparable employers to persons performing comparable services),</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">generally is considered to be clear and convincing evidence that thepayments are reasonable compensation for services to be rendered on orafter the date of change in ownership or control. However, except as providedin paragraph (b) of this A-42, such clear and convincing evidence willnot exist if the individual does not, in fact, perform the services. (b) If the employment of a disqualified individual is involuntarily terminatedbefore the end of a contract term and the individual is paid damages forthe breach of the contract, a showing of the following factors generallyis considered clear and convincing evidence that the payment is reasonablecompensation for personal services to be rendered on or after the dateof change in ownership or control: (1) The contract was not entered into, amended, or renewed in contemplationof the change in ownership or control; (2) The compensation the individual would have received under the contractwould qualify as reasonable compensation under section 162; (3) The damages do not exceed the present value (determined as of the dateof receipt) of the compensation the individual would have received underthe contract if the individual had continued to perform services for theemployer until the end of the contract term; (4) The damages are received because an offer to provide personal serviceswas made by the disqualified individual but was rejected by the employer;and (5) The damages are reduced by mitigation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Mitigation will be treated as occurring when such damages are reduced(or any payment of such damages is returned) to the extent of the disqualifiedindividual's earned income (within the meaning of section 911(d)(2)(A))during the remainder of the period in which the contract would have beenin effect. See Q/A-44 for rules regarding damages for a failure to makeseverance payments. (c) The following examples illustrate the principles of this A-42:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>A, a disqualified individual, has a three-year employmentcontract with Corporation M, a publicly traded corporation. Under thiscontract, A is to receive a salary for $100,000 for the first year of thecontract and, for each succeeding year, an annual salary that is 10 percenthigher than his prior year's salary. During the third year of the contract,Corporation N acquires all the stock of Corporation M. Prior to the changein ownership, Corporation N arranges to retain A's services by enteringinto an employment contract with him that is essentially the same as A'scontract with Corporation M. Under the new contract, Corporation N is tofulfill Corporation M's obligations for the third year of the old contract,and, for each of the succeeding years, pay A an annual salary that is 10percent higher than his prior year's salary. Amounts are payable underthe new contract only for the portion of the contract term during whichA remains employed by Corporation N. A showing of the facts described above(and in the absence of contradictory evidence) is regarded as clear andconvincing evidence that all payments under the new contract are reasonablecompensation for personal services to be rendered on or after the dateof the change in ownership. Therefore, the payments under this agreementare exempt from the definition of ``parachute payment'' pursuant to Q/A-9of this section.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>Assume the same facts as in example (1), except thatthe employment contract with Corporation N does not provide that amountsare payable under the contract only for the portion of the term for whichA remains employed by Corporation N. Shortly after the change in ownership,and despite A's request to remain employed by Corporation N, A's employmentwith Corporation N is involuntarily terminated. Shortly thereafter, A obtainsemployment with Corporation O. A commences a civil action against CorporationN, alleging breach of the employment  contract. In settlement of the litigation,A receives an amount equal to the present value of the compensation A wouldhave received under the contract with Corporation N, reduced by the amountof compensation A otherwise receives from Corporation O during the periodthat the contract would have been in effect. A showing of the facts describedabove (and in the absence of contradictory evidence) is regarded as clearand convincing evidence that the amount A receives as damages is reasonablecompensation for personal services to be rendered on or after the dateof the change in ownership. Therefore, the amount received by A is exemptfrom the definition of ``parachute payment'' pursuant to Q/A-9 of thissection.</ITAG>Q-43: Is any particular type of payment generally considered reasonablecompensation for personal services actually rendered before the date ofa change in ownership or control? A-43: (a) Yes. Payments of compensation earned before the date of a changein ownership or control generally are considered reasonable ccmpensationfor personal services actually rendered before the date of a change inownership or control if they qualify as reasonable compensation under section162. Q-44: May severance payments be treated as reasonable compensation? A-44: No. Severance payments are not treated as reasonable compensationfor personal services actually rendered before, or to rendered on or after,the date of a change in ownership or control. Moreover, any damages paidfor a failure to make severance payments are not treated as reasonablecompensation for personal services actually rendered before, or to be renderedon or after, the date of such change. For purposes of this section, theterm ``severance payment'' means any payment that is made to (or for thebenefit of) a disqualified individual on account of the termination ofsuch individual's employment prior to the end of a contract term, but shallnot include any payment that otherwise would be made to (or for the benefitof) such individual upon the termination of such individual's employment,whenever occurring. Miscellaneous Rules Q-45: How is the term ``corporation'' defined? A-45: For purposes of this section, the term ``corporation'' has the meaningprescribed by section 7701(a)(3) and shall include a publicly traded partnershiptreated as a corporation under section 7704 (a). Q-46: How is an affiliated group treated? A-46: For purposes of this section, and except as otherwise provided inthis section, all members of the same affiliated group (as defined in section1504, determined without regard to section 1504 (b)) are treated as onecorporation. Rules affected by this treatment of an affiliated group include(but are not limited to) rules relating to exempt payments of certain corporations(Q/A-6, Q/A-7 (except as provided therein)), payor of parachute payments(Q/A-10), disqualified individuals (Q/A-15 through Q/A-21 (except as providedtherein)), rebuttal of the presumption that payments are contingent ona change (Q/A-26 except as provide therein), change in ownership or control(Q/A-27, 28, 29), and reasonable compensation (Q/A-42, Q/A-43, and 44).Effective Date Q-47: What is the general effective date of section 280G and this section?A-47: In general, section 280G and this section apply to payments underagreements entered into or renewed after June 14, 1984. Any agreement thatis entered into before June 15, 1984, and is renewed after June 14, 1984,is to be treated as a new contract entered into on the day the renewaltakes effect. (See Q/A-48 regarding application of section 280G and thissection with respect to contracts entered into on or before June 14, 1984,and amended or supplemented after that date.)Q-48: How is a contract that is cancellable at will treated for purposesof the effective date of section 280G and this section? A-48: (a) For this purpose, a contract that is terminable or cancellableunconditionally at will by either party to the contract without the consentof the other, or by both parties to the contract, is treated as a new contractentered into on the date any such termination or cancellation, if made,would be effective. However, a contract is not treated as so terminableor cancellable if it can be terminated or cancelled only by terminatingthe employment relationship or independent contractor relationship of thedisqualified individual. (b) The following examples illustrate the principles of this A-48:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>Before June 15, 1984, a corporation and a disqualifiedindividual enter into a contract providing for payments to the individualcontingent on a change in the ownership or control of the corporation.The corporation may cancel the contract unconditionally at will by giving3 months notice. Thus, the earliest date that any such cancellation afterJune 14, l984, could be effective is September 15, 1984. The contract istreated as a new contract entered into on September 15, 1984, whether ornot it is in fact cancelled. Therefore, section 280G and this section applyto all payments made or to be made under the contract in taxable yearsof the individual that end on or after September 15, 1984. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>On January 1, 1984, a corporation and a disqualifiedindividual enter into a contract providing for payments to the individualcontingent on a change in the ownership or control of the corporation.The corporation has a right to terminate the employment of the individualwith or without cause, and the individual has the right to cease workingfor the corporation; otherwise, the contract is not terminable by eitherparty. Since the contract is terminable only by terminating the employmentrelationship between the parties, it is not treated as terminable at will.Thus, since the contract was entered into on or before June 14, l984, nopayments under the contract are subject to section 280G or this section.</ITAG>Q-49: Do section 280G and this section apply to payments under some agreementsentered into on or before June 14, 1984, that are not renewed after thisdate? A-49: Yes. Section 280G and this section apply to payments under a contractentered into on or before June 14, 1984, if the contract is amended orsupplemented after June 14, 1984, in significant relevant respect. Forthis purpose, a ``supplement'' to a contract is defined as a new contractentered into after June 14, 1984, that affects the trigger, amount, ortime of receipt of a payment under an existing contract. Q-50: Under what circumstances is a contract considered to be amended orsupplemented in significant relevant respect? A-50: Except as otherwise provided in Q/A-51 of this section, a contractis considered to be amended or supplemented in significant relevant respectif provisions for payments contingent on a change in ownership or control(``parachute provisions''), or provisions in the nature of parachute provisions,are added to the contract, or are amended or supplemented to provide significantadditional benefits to the disqualified individual. Thus, for example,a contract generally is treated as amended or supplemented in significantrelevant respect if it is amended or supplemented: (a) To add or modify, to the disqualified individual's benefit, a changein ownership or control trigger; (b) To increase amounts payable that are contingent on a change in ownershipor control (or, where payment is to be made under a formula, to modifythe formula to the disqualified individual's advantage); or (c) To accelerate, in the event of a change in ownership or control, thepayment of amounts otherwise payable at a later date. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">For purposes of A-50, a payment will not be treated as being acceleratedin the event of a change in ownership or control if the acceleration doesnot increase the present value of the payment. Q-51: Will normal adjustments in an employment contract cause the contractto be treated as amended or supplemented in significant relevant respect?A-51: No. A contract entered into on or before June 14, 1984, will notbe treated as amended or supplemented in significant relevant respect merelyby reason of normal adjustments in the terms of employment relationshipor independent contractor relationship of the disqualified individual.Whether an adjustment in the terms of such a relationship is considerednormal for this purpose depends on all of the facts and circumstances ofthe particular case. Relevant factors include, but are not limited to,the following: (a) The length of time between the adjustment and the change in ownershipor control; (b) The extent to which the corporation, at the time of the adjustment,viewed itself as a likely takeover candidate; (c) A comparison of the adjustment with historical practices of the corporation;(d) The extent of overlap between the group receiving the benefits of theadjustment and those members of that group who are the beneficiaries ofpre-June 15, 1984, parachute contracts; and (e) The size of the adjustment, both in absolute terms and in comparisonwith the benefits provided to other members of the group receiving thebenefits of the adjustment.Q-52: What are some examples illustrating the principles of Q/A-49, Q/A-50,and Q/A-51 of this section? A-52: The following examples illustrate these principles:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>Corporation M grants a nonqualified stock optionto a disqualified individual before June 15, 1984. After June 14, 1984,at a time when the option is currently vested and exercisable by the individualregardless of whether a change in ownership or control occurs, CorporationM amends the option to permit the individual to surrender it for cash orother property equal to the fair market value of the stock that would havebeen received if the option had been exercised (minus the exercise priceof the option). Since the individual could have exercised the option andthen sold the stock received upon the exercise, the amendment does notprovide significant additional benefits to the individual. Hence, the amendmentdoes not cause payments under the option to become subject to section 280Gand this section. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>Corporation N and A, a disqualified individual, enterinto an employment contract before June 15, 1984, that provides for a payment,contingent on a change in the ownership or control of Corporation N, equalto 4 times A's base amount. After June 14,1984, and at a time when CorporationN did not view itself as a likely takeover candidate, Corporation N increasesA's annual compensation by 25 percent to reflect additional managerialresponsibilities. Such increase is consistent with the historical practicesof Corporation N. Although the amount payable to A contingent on a changein ownership is increased, the employment contract is not treated as amendedin significant relevant respect because, under these facts (and in theabsence of contrary evidence), the  amendment to the contract is treatedas a normal adjustment in the terms of the employment relationship. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (3). </T3>Before June 15, 1984, Corporation O enters into contractswith disqualified individuals A, B, and C, providing for payments contingenton a change  in the ownership of Corporation O equal to 4 times each individual'sbase amount. After June 14, 1984, Corporation O, consistent with its historicalpractices, grants identical nonvested stock options to numerous disqualifiedindividuals, including A, B, and C. All of these new options provide thatthe vesting of all such options will be accelerated if a change in theownership or control of Corporation O occurs. Section 280G and this sectionapply to payments under the options granted after June 14, 1984. However,the granting of these options does not cause the contracts that were enteredinto before June 15, 1984, to be treated as amended or supplemented insignificant relevant respect because, under these facts (and in the absenceof contrary evidence), the granting of options is treated as a normal adjustmentin the terms of the employment relationship. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lawrence B.
