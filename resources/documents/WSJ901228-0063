The population shifts that undergird the new Census Bureaureapportionment figures have been going on for years, butonly this week has the political map been adjusted to reflectthem. The government's new decennial atlas of Americanpolitics makes it clear that the path to the White House goesthrough firmly Republican territory.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The first message from these figures is that theDemocrats' trouble just got worse,&quot; says Larry Bartels, aUniversity of Rochester political scientist who is an expertin presidential elections. &quot;They needed a new strategy evenif there weren't going to be adjustments in the ElectoralCollege, but it's particularly critical now that the map ischanging.&quot;   The political changes that are being ushered in by the newpopulation figures go far beyond the shifts in the size ofcongressional delegations in 21 states and the emergence ofCalifornia, Texas and Florida, whose combined delegationscomprise about a quarter of the House. The number of votes inthe Electoral College is the total of each state's House andSenate members, giving increased power in presidentialelections to several states that are safely Republican anddecreasing the Electoral College votes of several states thatare within the Democrats' grasp in presidential elections.   Presidential elections, to be sure, are shaped byimportant geopolitical and economic factors, and the PersianGulf crisis that remains unresolved as President Bushapproaches his third year in power may be more important in1992 than any long-term voter trends. Even so, Democratsworry that the new figures released by the Census Bureau maymake their challenge even tougher.   &quot;Just by sheer population trends alone, the Republicansgained a huge leg up in the next election,&quot; says Paul Maslin,a Democratic political strategist. &quot;Every 10 years that go byis going to mean the geography is even worse.&quot;   The states of Texas, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina,Arizona and Virginia, considered safe or probable Republicanstates in the 1992 election and perhaps beyond, gained atotal of 11 electoral votes as a result of the figures theCensus Bureau released this week. New York, Pennsylvania,Illinois, Massachusetts, Iowa and West Virginia, consideredsafe or probable Democratic states in a reasonably closeelection, lost a total of 10 electoral votes.   That's bad news for a party that has lost all but three ofthe 10 presidential elections after the Roosevelt-Truman era.Moreover, the new geography of politics has already amplifiedthe cries within the Democratic Party for an overhaul of itsstrategies and policies.   &quot;We need Democrats who can win in areas that are growing,Democrats that are pro-growth, pro-opportunity, pro-family,tough on crime and have a sense of limited government but whoaren't anti-government,&quot; says Alvin From, executive directorof the Democratic Leadership Council, which styles itself asa forum for moderate Democrats. &quot;The census only reinforcesthe need for Democrats to change.&quot;   The Census Bureau figures underline the growing importanceof California, both in the House and in presidentialelections, and it signals a glimmer of hope for Democratsthirsty for victory in presidential elections. Nearly one outof eight members of the House that will be elected inNovember 1992 will be from California; the state's 52 seatswill be by far the largest congressional delegation inhistory.   But in the past two presidential elections, where liberalDemocrats have run against conservative Republicans, theDemocrats have done slightly better in California than in therest of the country. Democrats felt that if MassachusettsGov. Michael Dukakis had run a better campaign in 1988 theDemocrats could have won California, which hasn't fallen inthe Democratic column since Lyndon Johnson's 1964 landslide,and taken a sweep of the Pacific coast.   GOP political theorist Kevin Philips believes that if theDemocrats do prevail in California, they could win apresidential election without even carrying the popular vote.   In any case, virtually no Democratic strategy for winningthe White House can succeed without California and its 54electoral votes. Barring a political upheaval or theemergence of a strong issue such as an unsuccessfulresolution of the Gulf crisis that penalizes the Republicans,the GOP can get to about 200 of the 270 electoral votesrequired for victory with their natural base, which nowincludes many states in the deep South. With California andone other large state such as Ohio or Michigan, both of whichhave fallen into GOP hands repeatedly, they are over the top.   The Census Bureau figures put the population movements ofthe past decade, and their political implications, in sharprelief. As it has since the earliest days of the 19thcentury, the U.S. political power center is moving west; thenortheastern states, which comprised more than half therepresentation in the first Congress and more than a quarterof the House when the western frontier officially disappearedin 1890, will have only a fifth of the House in the 102ndCongress.   The population shift away from the so-called Frostbeltstates, a dramatic feature of the 1980 census, has continued.&quot;The balance of power is shifting to the `Sunbelt,'&quot; saysCandis Penn, executive director of the Southern GovernorsAssociation. &quot;The country may not realize it now, but oncereapportionment gets under way it will be very clear.&quot;   The implications for the House remain murky, however.Although Democrats have had scant success in presidentialelections, they have built up large majorities in the Housewhile the Republicans have struggled to find credible Housecandidates and to elect them.   &quot;The fact that Bush carried so many states in 1988 may beoverblown in these calculations,&quot; says William O'Hare,director of policy studies for the non-partisan PopulationResearch Bureau. &quot;People vote differently for Congress thanthey do for president, and you can't carry the presidentialinterpretation too far.&quot;   Now that the numbers are out, the real politics gets underway. The states begin their redistricting processes nextspring, using census data to reshape districts for the statelegislature as well as for Congress.   And in Washington, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbachermust make the politically charged decision by mid-July onwhether to adjust the 1990 figures to correct for theundercount of minorities and the poor. The latest wrinkle:Commerce officials dread being caught in the crossfire whenit becomes clear that blacks likely would gain representationbut Hispanics probably would lose from a statisticaladjustment.   ---                   Growing GOP Power                                                                                                          Number of times in the last eight presidential electionsthat the Republicans have won in states gaining power in theElectoral College:                                                                                                                           NUMBER OF TIMES      ELECTORAL VOTES                    WON BY               AS RESULTS OF  STATE             REPUBLICANS          1990 CENSUS                                                                                                        California               7                54 (up 7) Texas                    4                32 (up 3) Florida                  6                25 (up 4) North Carolina           5                14 (up 1) Georgia                  5                13 (up 1) Virginia                 7                13 (up 1) Washington               5                11 (up 1) Arizona                  8                 8 (up 1)</TEXT></DOC>
