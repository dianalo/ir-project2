But Iran later accused Iraq of violating the truce by sending awarplane to bomb the town of Gachsaran in southwestern Iran.   Tehran Television, monitored in Cyprus, quoted a spokesman forthe War Information Headquarters as saying the plane was ``forcedto flee under heavy anti-aircraft fire.''   He said the aircraft was seen ``dropping it bombs out offrustration in a desert area.''   The unidentified spokesman said the incident ``indicates Iraqwants to continue its acts of mischief, and the Islamic combatantswill not remain silent if civilian targets are attacked again.''Iraq did not comment on the report.   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Cyprus,earlier reported that Revolutionary Guards attacked and set ablazethe offshore Al-Amaya radar facility in the northern tip of thegulf Friday night.   Al-Amaya had been transformed by the Iraqis from an oil platformto monitor activity in the gulf. IRNA said surface-to-air andshore-to-sea missile pads on the facility were destroyed in theattack.   The official Iraqi News Agency, also monitored in Cyprus,reported that Iraqi warplanes blasted the Imam Hassan oil pumpingstation in southwestern Iran Saturday afternoon.   The agency quoted an unidentified Iraqi military spokesman assaying the facility was ``totally destroyed.''   In an earlier dispatch, Iraq reported to have struck a ``verylarge maritime target'' off the Iranian coast Friday night. Theattack was not independently verified by gulf-based shippingexecutives.   INA quoted a military spokesman as saying the Iraqi warplanesscored ``an accurate and effective hit'' on the vessel, andreturned safely.   It quoted a spokesman as saying the raids reflected Iraq's``determination to destroy Iran's economic lifeline and deprive theenemy of revenues employed to finance aggression.''   The cease-fire in the ``war of the cities'' passed the 24-hourmark, with no attacks on each other's capitals or major populationcenters.   Hundreds of civilian casualties were reported in theunprecedented 12-day duel. Iraq claimed to have hurled 71long-range missiles into Tehran and two other cities and Iran saidit fired 29 missiles at Iraqi cities.   The barrage ended Friday afternoon after Iraq fired eightrockets at Tehran and three at the holy city of Qom, the last onejust 16 minutes before the 4 p.m. truce deadline.   Iraq had made its right to fire the last shot a precondition forthe truce, on grounds that Iran, the ``aggressive party,'' hadtriggered the exchange.   Iraq's terms for the cease-fire also stipulated that Tehran notattempt to launch a ground offensive against any Iraqi populationcenters.   It did not bar either side from continuing to attack military oreconomically strategic targets.   Ali Ahani, director general of European and American affairs ofIran's Foreign Ministry, speaking in the Hague, Netherlands, saidIran will unleash a new battlefront offensive against Iraq inresponse to the missile attacks.   ``We are going to give a decisive response in the war of thefronts because of this bloodshed,'' he said, refusing to providespecifics on the offensive.   Baghdad's officially controlled press called the cease-fire atriumph and warned Iran against resuming the bombardment, INA said.   Al-Thawra, voice of Iraq's ruling Arab Baath Socialist Party,said the missile war taught the ``charlatans of Iran'' a ``painful,bitter lesson.'' It said any Iranian ``violation'' of thecease-fire ``would, for sure, generate a devastating Iraqi reply.''   Iraq had vowed to disrupt oil exports by which Iran finances itsshare of the 7{-year-old war. The attacks concentrate on Iran'sgovernment-owned or chartered tankers that shuttle oil from KhargIsland in the northern gulf to centers in safer waters near theStrait of Hormuz.   Iraq broke a three-week lull in the ``tanker war'' on Wednesday,when its warplanes struck the 41,195-ton Maltese-flag tankerTenacity.   Baghdad reported another attack on Friday, which like the one itclaimed on Saturday, could not be confirmed.   The Iranians retaliate for Iraqi raids with attacks on neutralcommercial shipping. Although gulf radio monitors say Iraniangunboats were actively challenging ships in the southern gulf inrecent days, there have been no attacks since Feb. 11.   Indications arose of a new potential threat to shipping in thesouthern gulf, where Iran was reported by U.S. military sources tobe building launch pads for its Chinese-made Silkworm anti-shipmissiles on Abu Musa, a tiny island used as a base by Iran'sRevolutionary Guards.   The Washington-based sources, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said American intelligence had detected no sign ofactual missiles being installed.   Positioning the weapons, which have a range of 50 miles on AbuMusa would extend the so-called ``Silkworm envelope'' by about 100miles into the gulf, embracing the busy United Arab Emirates citiesof Dubai, Sharjah and Ras Al-Khaimah.</TEXT></DOC>
