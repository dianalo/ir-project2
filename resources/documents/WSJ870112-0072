The FSLIC, in a suit filed in federal court in Brooklyn, said it wants to recover more than $50 million to cover loans that the FSLIC assumed as part of a merger of financially troubled Flushing Federal with Long Island Savings Bank.    The suit accused the former officers of violating their fiduciary duties to Flushing Federal in the approval of millions of dollars of &quot;imprudent&quot; loans that were never repaid. The suit says the 12 should never have made the loans, which led to the thrift's failure and an FSLIC-supervised merger with Long Island Savings on April 29, 1986.    The FSLIC had agreed to assume as much as $70 million in Flushing Federal loans to facilitate that merger.    Among those sued was Carl Cardascia, president and chief executive officer from February 1982 to April 1985. His attorney, George Farrell, said his client is innocent of wrongdoing. </TEXT></DOC>
