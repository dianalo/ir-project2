The campaign, to take place throughout the U.S., will try to counter a Washington interagency report which indicated that the acid rain problem was much less serious than claimed by Canadian government studies.    Canada's Environment Minister Tom McMillan dismissed the U.S. report as &quot;voodoo science.&quot; The study, which was released Thursday, was compiled by U.S. government agencies as part of a 10-year acid rain research program initiated by Congress in 1980.    The report provoked an angry reaction from politicians in all Canadian political parties. Polls indicate Canadians regard acid rain as the most important U.S.-Canadian issue.    About half of Canada's acid rain problem is attributed to wind-borne pollutants carried into Canada from the U.S. Canadian authorities say acid rain is damaging the country's lakes, forests, wildlife and buildings. It is also suspected of causing respiratory problems. The U.S. report found little evidence of an immediate broad threat to the environment or public health.    Mr. McMillan, one of the most outspoken members of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Conservative government, said the government's acid rain campaign in the U.S. will include advertising, speeches and lobbying on all levels of state and federal governments. The advertising will be partly aimed at the thousands of Americans who vacation on Canadian lakes threatened by acid rain.&quot;We want to mobilize the strongest possible campaign that we can,&quot; he told reporters.    Mr. McMillan said he would request funds for the campaign from federal and provincial sources, but he didn't say how much he would seek.    The Reagan administation is expected to reply later this year to Canada's request for a U.S.-Canadian agreement on curbing the acid rain pollutants that winds carry in both directions across the border. &quot;We are throwing garbage on each other's front lawn,&quot; Mr. McMillan said. In the U.S., acid gases come mainly from coal-burning power plants. In Canada they are mainly produced by ore smelters.    Mr. McMillan said he was &quot;deeply concerned&quot; that the Reagan administration would be influenced in its response to Canada by the U.S. interagency report, which he described as &quot;incomplete and misleading.&quot; A senior Canadian government scientist said the U.S. report had serious &quot;errors of omission.&quot;    Canada's goal is to persuade the U.S. to cut in half by 1994 the amount of acid gas pollutants that cross into Canada. The Canadian government has reached legally binding agreements with most provincial governments for a similar cutback in Canada.    At a meeting with Mr. Mulroney in April, President Reagan agreed to consider Mr. Mulroney's request for a bilateral accord to combat acid rain.    The U.S. administration has repeatedly said that more research is required before large sums of money are committed to curbing acid gas emissions from power plants and other sources.    But Mr. McMillan, in a letter last week to Lee Thomas, administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, said that despite incomplete scientific information on the impact of chlorofluorocarbons on the earth's ozone layer, the U.S. and Canada were able to take leading roles in the international agreement to limit chlorofluorocarbon releases to the atmosphere.    &quot;Science's understanding of the acid rain problem far exceeds that of stratospheric ozone depletion,&quot; the minister said. </TEXT></DOC>
