Comptroller Robert L. Clarke announced the decision duringthe weekend, saying that the increase would enable his officeto perform a full examination of all 3,900 national banks atleast once every 18 months. Currently, the comptroller'soffice annually examines national banks with assets of morethan $1 billion and smaller banks with financial oroperational weaknesses. Small, healthy banks aren't examinedon a regular schedule.</LP><TEXT>   Two weeks ago, the House Banking Committee charged thatthe comptroller's office had been lax in supervising smallbanks and that national bank failures had caused adisproportionate share of losses suffered by the bank depositinsurance fund over the past 5 1/2 years.   On Thursday, the Senate Banking Committee will beginhearings to consider whether Mr. Clarke should be confirmedto a second five-year term as comptroller. Several SenateDemocrats want to make Mr. Clarke the scapegoat for thenation's banking problems, and the hearings promise to belong and contentious. Republicans charge that Mr. Clarke hascontributed to the credit crunch by being too tough as aregulator, while Democrats charge that he has been too lax.To support their case, Democrats are citing the comptroller'sslowness in attacking problems at the Bank of New England,which failed early this year, and the House Banking Committeereport.   In a letter to Rep. Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the HouseBanking Committee, Mr. Clarke rejected the report's assertionthat the comptroller was less effective in supervising banksthan the Federal Reserve Board, which regulates 1,000state-chartered banks that are members of the Fed system, andthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which supervises about7,500 other state-chartered banks.   But Mr. Clarke conceded in his letter to the TexasDemocrat that, &quot;We agree that in many instances more-frequentexaminations can provide us with better information aboutsmall banks.&quot; He said that his office would have to increaseassessments it charges national banks to pay for the newexaminers, but he didn't give any details.   In fighting for his reconfirmation, Mr. Clarke plans tomake a spirited defense of his record, noting that his officelaunched a number of regulatory initiatives during adifficult economic environment. In two documents issuedyesterday -- his letter delivered to Rep. Gonzalez and thetext of a speech he plans to give to the Consumer BankersAssociation today -- Mr. Clarke said that he was the firstregulator to call attention to the risks banks faced becauseof an overconcentration in commercial real estate lending. Healso said that his office was the first regulator to stationresident examination teams in the largest banks.   Meanwhile, the Treasury Department, of which thecomptroller's office is a part, over the weekend moved toblunt another charge against Mr. Clarke: that his personalinvestments raised the appearance of a conflict of interest.These allegations arose in the spring when it was disclosedthat Mr. Clarke, a wealthy Texas lawyer, had managed hissubstantial portfolio of stocks, partnership investments andhigh-risk, high-yield junk bonds since taking office in 1985and that he had extensive bank loans. A Treasuryinvestigation in the spring found that Mr. Clarke hadn'tviolated any conflict-of-interest rules, yet Mr. Clarkedecided to place his investments in a blind trust to dispelconcerns of conflict.   The Treasury released a letter from Stephen Potts, thedirector of the Office of Government Ethics, that said theagency found no violation of government rules.   In a second letter to Sen. Carl Levin (D., Mich.),chairman of the subcommittee on Oversight of GovernmentManagement, Mr. Potts said, &quot;Based upon our review, webelieve there is no demonstration that Mr. Clarke conductedhis personal financial affairs with disregard for ethicsstandards.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
