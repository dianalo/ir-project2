The composite with random orientation of short C fibersswelled due to the elastic deformation of the fiber skeleton above 573K. In a 3-D isotropic composite, the Cu matrix softened above 573 K andwas fractured by the repulsive force of C fibers which were elasticallydeformed and released during heating. Swelling of the composite occurredwhen the fiber content was greater than or = 20 volume percent or thefiber length exceeded 0.5 millimeters. The addition of carbide-formingelements such as Ti was effective in preventing the swelling.</TEXT></DOC>
