This schematic organization is not sufficient to succeedin a nuclear programme: one has to consider very carefully the attributionof responsibilities. It appears, that, among all the different systemswhich exist in the world for the organization of a nuclear project, itis always the utility which bears the overall responsibility for theimplementation of the project. It defines objectives such as productioncapacity, schedule, price; it takes part in the definition of a nationalpolicy for energy supply, for the choice of a type of reactor, for theimplementation of a national nuclear industry; it selects sites and conductsfeasibility studies including a preliminary project; it participatesin the definition of organization charts and selects contractors; itcalls for and obtains authorizations from regulatory bodies; it managesthe project, coordinates contractors and permanently ensures that goalsare attained as regards safety, quality, schedule, costs. The Frenchutility has directly taken charge of all these basic responsibilitiesand this is commonly considered as a major reason of the success of theFrench nuclear programme. Depending on its capacities, the utility maydelegate some of these responsibilities - mainly concerning engineeringand project management - to experienced firms. (Abstract Truncated)</TEXT></DOC>
