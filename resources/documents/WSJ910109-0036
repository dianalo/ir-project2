But stockholders and bondholders, including somemajor institutional investors, were losers.   New England Mutual Life Insurance Co., New York LifeInsurance Co., The Whitehall Group, Textron Inc.'s TextronInvestment Management unit, T. Rowe Price Associates andTravelers Corp. owned some of the $706 million in bondsrendered virtually worthless by the federal takeover. Still,none of the institutions individually hold a large portion ofthose bonds, so they won't be hurt significantly.</LP><TEXT>   Stockholders, including some bank employees who investedmuch of their savings in the bank's stock during the 1980s,were wiped out. The bank's shares were valued at nearly $2.6billion when they sold for $37.25 a share in August 1987 and$2.1 billion as recently as March 1988, when the stock wastrading at $30.875 a share. Now their investments areworthless.   &quot;I basically lost everything, 20 years worth of puttingmoney in the company stock plan, everything,&quot; said a Bank ofNew England vice president, who asked not to be named. &quot;Ofcourse, that stock was to support me in my retirement, whichlooks like it will be forced on me a little earlier thanexpected.&quot;   The takeover by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. meansthat all that is left of Bank of New England, which filed forliquidation Monday under Chapter 7 of the federal BankruptcyCode, is about $50 million in assets, of which $20 million isin cash and the rest in various partnerships and investments,said a bank official.   The FDIC, which expects to spend a total of about $2.3billion to bail out the bank, has first claim on thoseassets, though FDIC officials have not announced whether theywill seek them to defray the cost of seizing the bank.   After the federal government, next in line are holders of$181 million in senior debt and then holders of $525 millionin junior debt. Representatives of both groups conceded theremay be only a maximum of 15 cents paid on each dollar of debtowed various bondholders.   The bondholders criticized regulators, contending that thebank's failure could have been avoided if officials hadspotted the bank's problems earlier. &quot;These were not junkbonds, these were A-rated bonds 18 months ago, bought byconservative, responsible bondholders,&quot; said RothschildInc.'s Wilbur Ross, who represents senior bondholders. &quot;Wherewere the examiners, the auditors, everybody who put this outas an A-rated bond?&quot;   But some say that bondholders might have salvaged somevalue, at least temporarily, if they had completed adebt-for-equity swap. A swap could have injected as much as$706 million in desperately needed capital into the bank andimproved its cash position by reducing interest costs, givingit more breathing room.   Though negotiations began last summer, delays were causedby bickering among senior and junior debt holders and thebank. As a result, it wasn't until December, when it was toolate, that a tentative deal was struck. &quot;Three hours beforewe were seized we were still pushing them to get us a finalproposal for the swap,&quot; says Tim McNamar, the bank's vicechairman.   Bondholders, of course, dispute this analysis of thedeal's failure. &quot;Ultimately, the bank's overly optimisticview that they could find a private solution to theirproblems, that they could make it without federal assistance,is what made the deal not happen,&quot; said Gregory Kiernan,chairman of the junior bondholders committee, which includesPrudential Insurance Co. of America, Nationale-NederlandenN.V.'s Life Insurance Co. of Georgia unit, Paine Webber GroupInc. and AID Association for Lutherans, a mutual insurancecompany of the Lutheran Church. Mr. Kiernan said he andothers attempted to convince the bank as early as Octoberthat it needed some kind of regulatory intervention, inconjuncton with the bond swap, to survive.   However, a federal infusion combined with a swap wasn't inthe cards. FDIC officials argue that they want to protectbanks and depositors -- not give value to otherwise worthlesssecurities to protect investors. &quot;If we were in the businessof saving holding companies,&quot; FDIC Chairman William Seidmanhas said, &quot;we'd be busted.&quot;   Holders of Bank of New England certificates of deposit,some of which are paying rates as high as 9%, will mostlikely see those rates lowered. The FDIC and any purchaser ofthe bank would have the right to break those contracts andlower rates on what are currently some of nation'shighest-paying CDs.   For stockholders, the situation is simpler, but no lesspainful.   &quot;We bought high and sold at a not-so-happy price,&quot; saysJohn Neff, portfolio manager of the $6.3 billion WindsorFunds. Mr. Neff purchased three million shares at about $23apiece in October 1989. He said he sold the stock in thethird and fourth quarters of 1990, when it had dropped tobetween $3.125 and $1 a share. &quot;Our errors were in notrecognizing how bad the New England economy was going to getand how willy-nilly the bank was in granting loans inconstruction and commercial real estate.&quot;   The same mistakes, however, were made by some seniorofficials of the bank. Among the biggest buyers of the Bankof New England's stock in the fall of 1989, just before theextent of the bank's woes were disclosed, were some of thebank's top officers and directors, who bought when the stockwas still selling at around $18 a share.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          T.
