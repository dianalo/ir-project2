Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said 345insurgents and seven Pakistani militiamen were killed in the airstrikes in Jalalabad and southern Kandahar province.   Amani said only 15 Afghan troops were killed. Six civilians diedwhen they were caught in a cross-fire in the battle forgovernment-held city of Jalalabad, he said.   According to Amani, 173 guerrillas died in bombing raids eastand south of Jalalabad between sundown Thursday and late Saturdayafternoon.   His figures could not immediately be verified. ThePakistani-based guerrillas usually report far lower death tolls.   Fighting was continuing near Jalalabad, he said, but it was``100 percent certain'' the U.S-backed guerrillas were losing.   In another air strike south of Kandahar, 172 guerrillas andseven Pakistani militiamen were killed Friday, he said. The cityhas been under guerrilla attack for more than a year.   Also in Kandahar, Amani said, about 2,500 guerrillas attacked asecurity post at Takhta Poll, 25 miles south of the city. Heclaimed combatants included 500 Pakistani militiamen and 12 SaudiArabian advisers.   ``They were forced to retreat and were not even able to carryaway the dead bodies,'' he said, adding Afghan troops recovered 95of 179 insurgents.   Pakistan supports the guerrillas but denied that any nationalsare fighting in Afghanistan.   The anti-communist guerrillas launched their first majoroffensive on Jalalabad on March 6, less than three weeks after theSoviet Union withdrew the last Red Army troops who had been helpingNajib's forces in the decade-old civil war.   The government claims more than 2,100 people, mostly guerrillas,have died since then in the battle for Jalalabad, 75 miles east ofKabul.   Amani said the guerrillas were shelling the city and surroundingsecurity outposts with artillery and mortars, but he said theinsurgents were 15 to 18 miles from the city.   Since Thursday night, he said, guerrillas fired 1,200 shells andartillery rounds on Jalalabad airport and military posts from theGhaziabad area south of the city. In the same period, they fired4,500 rounds from Shewa, a town east of Jalalabad, he said.Ghaziabad and Shewa are within 25 miles of the Pakistani border.   ``Our air force's attack impeded their attack and in some areasthey were fully forced to retreat,'' said Amani.   He said three Afghan military supply convoys have reachedJalalabad since Thursday with the last arriving Saturday afternoon.The breakthrough signals a setback for rebels who have besieged thecity since March 6.   If Jalalabad falls, it would give the guerrillas their firstmajor city and provide internal headquarters for agovernment-in-exile elected in Pakistan a month ago.   Jalalabad had a pre-war population of 200,000, but fewer thanhalf that number are thought to remain after a decade of war thatsent 5 million Afghanis fleeing to Pakistan and Iran.   Amani also charged Pakistani border police opened fire andkilled 18 refugee women who tried to return to Afghanistan atTorkham to ascertain whether their relatives were among deadguerrilla fighters.
