Spectraof the wind power input and the electrical power output, normalized bytheir variances, are shown. Because of its heavier construction, theWindmatic turbine was expected to have a greater moment of inertia andhence a lower cutoff frequency. The data show the opposite. The operatingstatus indicated by the mean power output at which the spectra were measuredseems to determine the overall inertia of the turbine. Both machinesoperate at a constant rpm but the load, and thus the torque, rises withincreasing wind speed. Consequently, the inertia of the turbine increases.Therefore, a comparison of the cutoff frequency or response length ofdifferent wind turbines is meaningful only if the spectra are taken atthe same state of operation. For the machines considered, the best pointfor such measurements was found to be the wind speed at which the powercurves intersect. A graph showing the response length as a function ofpower output and wind speed is thought to be an important informationsource for wind turbine evaluation. 3 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
