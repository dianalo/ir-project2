(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>FUTURE OF 4GLs LIES IN CASE INTEGRATIONandM;After 20 years of evolution and redefinition, fourth-generation languages(4GLs) are alive and well.andP;  They are employed by end users for reportingapplications, and they are also used extensively by application developersfor building medium- to large-scale systems.andM;Products falling under the 4GL umbrella have diverse capabilities, but somecommon denominators in-clude ease of use over traditional methods andincreased programmer pro-ductivity compared to third-generation languages,such as Cobol.andM;Although developers have found it hard to measure the effectiveness of 4GLsdue to the lack of a standard definition, 4GLs are used prevalentlythroughout most organizations.andP;  Their benefits have been proven.andP;  They areconsidered to be at the mature phase of their product life cycle.andM;By comparision, Case technology, which has blossomed over the last fiveyears, is just beginning to establish itself.andP;  This technology offersproductivity improvements over traditional methods, as well as quality andmaintenance benefits.andM;Unlike 4GLs, Case tools are used solely by application developers.andP;  But like4GLs, they lack a rigorous definition.andP;  These tools automate the systemsdevelopment processes and address not only the programming phase of the lifecycle, but also the planning, analysis, design, testing and maintenancephases.andM;With the advent of Case technology comes a new dimension to the scope andbenefits of 4GL applications.andP;  By adding Case facilities via interfaces ornew product components, 4GLs are evolving into a powerful facility for thedevelopment of complex and large-scale systems.andM;The future of 4GLs lies in the continued development of ease of usecapabilities, and an integrated set of &quot;4GL/Case&quot; tools for the applicationdeveloper.andM;TYPES OF 4GLsandM;There are three classes of 4GLs: end-user tools, application developerfacilities and tools that emerged from relational database systems.andP;  Some4GLs fall within multiple categories.andM;End-user product tools include: Ramis from On-Line Software of Fort Lee,N.J.; Focus from Information Builders, Inc. of New York; and Nomad from MustSoftware or Norwalk, Conn.andM;Products for application developers include: Mantis from Cincom ofCincinnati; CA-Ideal and CA-ADS from Computer Associates International ofGarden City, N.Y.; Natural 2 from Software AG of Reston, Va.; Magna 8 fromMagna Software of New York; and Progress from Progress Software of Bedford,Mass.andM;Fourth-generation languages that emerged from relational databases includeOracle from Oracle Corp. of Belmont, Calif., and Ingres from Ingres Corp. ofAlameda, Calif.andP;  Focus and Nomad seed to cross the lines, since both endusers and application developers utilize them.andM;Focus users are building larger applications with the tool than they did inthe past, according to an Information Builders spokesperson.andP;  The systems arelarger from the standpoint of number of users supported and application sizeand complexity.andP;  Data processing professionals have come to accept 4GL toolsas productive for systems development.andM;SUBSTANTIAL 4GL INVESTMENTSandM;Many organizations have trained hundreds of end users in the use of 4GLs forreporting, data access and analysis.andP;  The products are used across multiplehardware platforms such as PCs, minicomputers and mainframes, as well as inmany operating environments.andM;According to Samuel Kulp, senior analyst for Blue Cross and Blue Shield ofGeorgia, &quot;Focus was recently acquired to provide users access to their dataon the mainframe and on the PC.&quot;andM;Both end users and application developers for the state of California havebeen using Ramis on the mainframe for many years.andP;  Art White, programmeranalyst for the state at the Teale Data Center, Sacramento, Calif., says,&quot;Ramis was used in a scientific library application where there were 100,000titles, and several cross-references and alternate indexes.andP;  We also use themenu-based architecture of Ramis for quick applications, and the reportwriter provides users with enormous capabilities.&quot;andM;Tim Corrigan, manager of the Data Administration and Development Center forWashington National Insurance Co., Evanston, Ill., uses CA-Ideal forlarge-scale production applications.andM;According to Corrigan, &quot;We are contemplating building bridges between theCase tools, IEW From KnowledgeWare, and CA-Ideal and CA-Datacom from ComputerAssociates.andP;  We have already built our own homegrown database design tools.andO;The planning aspects of Case are very important to us.andP;  Therefore, theinterface to IEW is very desirable.&quot;andM;John Vaccariello, senior systems analyst at Travelers/EBS Inc. of Maitland,Fla., uses Informix on an IBM/RT.andM;Vaccariello said, &quot;We set up a 4GL development environment for Informix Formsand developed an Independent Insurance Agency System with the product.andP;  TheCharles River Workstation is our Case tool for front-end analysis.andP;  We wereable to automatically generate our database from the Case tool, but not ourcode.andP;  A code generator would have been helpful.&quot;andM;Judy Feldman, assistant project manager at Hughes Space and CommunicationsInformation Systems Group, Seabrook, Md., recently worked on a project thatneeded requirements to be traced.andP;  The Teamwork Case tool from Cadre Inc.,andO;Providence, R.I., did not provide her with the needed traceability andconsistency checking.andM;Feldman said, &quot;To provide additional capability for our Case tool, wedeveloped a one-way link between Teamwork and the Ingres database.andP;  Wedeveloped an Ingres database with the text that we required and merged thatinformation with the data that we moved to ingres from Teamwork.andP;  We werethen able to cross-reference the information and perform the neededrequirements traceability.&quot;andM;Ingres is used extensively for medium-sized applications on Sun and VAXmachines at Hughes.andM;APPROPRIATE USE OF 4GLsandM;Organizations have found appropriate uses for 4GLs.andP;  In the early days,mistakes were made attempting to use &quot;the end-user 4GLs&quot; for high-volumetransaction processing applications or large database systems.andP;  Today, many4GL users employ their production databases, such as IMS, DB2 or IDMS, alongwith 4GL languages.andM;Most 4GLs have unbundled their database from their 4GL language.andP;  Forexample, Focus, Ramis and Nomad all access the popular mainframe databases.andO;They have also developed write access to DB2, so that their 4GL maintenancelanguages can be used to update DB2 tables.andM;The &quot;application developers' 4GLs&quot; are also unbundling their 4GL from theunderlying database.andP;  Natural 2 was unbundled from Adabas.andP;  It now supportsDB2, SQL/DS, IMS and Vsam.andP;  Progress Software also plans to separate its 4GLlanguage from its database.andM;According to Chip Ziering, vice president of development at Progress, &quot;We arestriving for portability across environments.andP;  We plan to connect differentdatabases on distributed systems, such as a Progress server on a LAN and anOracle database on a Unix machine.andP;  The user can then join the two databaseswiththe Progress 4GL.andP;  We also plan to connect between different networkprotocols.&quot;andM;4GL PORTABILITYandM;Another recent trend for 4GLs has been portability across hardware platforms.andO;An application developed in PC/Focus, for example, may easily be ported to aVAX/VMS or an IBM mainframe environment.andP;  Oracle runs on many platforms fromPCs to mainframes, and in diverse operating environments.andP;  Even the&quot;application developer 4GLs&quot; are striving to run on more environments.andM;The Software AG product line runs on IBM mainframes and 9370 series, under awide variety of IBM operating systems, DEC VAX/VMS environments, WangLaboratory VS series and Siemens computers.andP;  And Cincom is looking to moveproducts into the Unix and AS/400 environments.andM;&quot;End-user 4GLs&quot; continue to improve their user interfaces.andP;  For example,Information Builders added Talk Technology, a menu-based front end to theFocus command language, and On-Line Software added the Ramis Menu-BasedArchitecture to the Ramis 4GL.andM;In the future, we will see graphical front ends to the 4GL syntax-basedlanguages.andP;  On-Line Software plans to add a &quot;friendly&quot; front end to Ramis,which is compatible with IBM's Common User Access (CUA) standards, on an OS/2platform.andM;&quot;Application developer 4GLs&quot; are also improving their user interfaces.andO;According to Dennis Butler, director of application development technology atCincom,&quot; a new user interface to increase programmer productivity is plannedfor Mantis which is CUA-compatible.&quot;andM;Different products have emerged to improve the user interface.andP;  For example,Proteo, from Proteo Technology of Princeton, N.J., is a PC-based tool thatintegrates software on multiple platforms with an interface to users.andP;  It canbe used in conjunction with 4GLs.andM;PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTSandM;4GL vendors keep striving for a better product to extend the use of theirsoftware to larger scale applications development.andM;In the near term, Nomad from Must Software will include Static SQL to provideimproved performance and the security required of high-volume DB2 access.andP;  Inaddition, the Advanced Transaction Processing Server (ATPS) is a newarchitecture through which Nomad on work-stations will access MVS resources.andM;Under ATPS, it will be possible to design, prototype and test an applicationon the workstation.andP;  When the application is compiled, Nomad, together withcompile-time facilities within ATPS, will preprare ATPS to act as anefficient server for the application.andM;Used with Nomad on a workstation, ATPS can support hundreds of simultaneoususers for transaction-oriented applications, served by a single addressspace, according to a Must Software spokesperson.andM;Information Buildings is also addressing high-volume transaction processingapplications.andP;  A multisession option via Vtam allows 50 to hundreds of usersto update the same file simultaneously (not the same record).andM;PRODUCTION APPLICATIONSandM;Focus users are building more production applications with Focus.andP;  Forexample, Steven Gold, manager of Systems and Programming with Echlin, Inc.,andO;of Branford, Conn., has used Focus for all his applications.andP;  Echlin, amanufacturer of replacement automobile parts, is a Fortune 500 company with$1.5 billion in sales.andP;  The company recently converted financial andpersonnel applications developed in Cobol, CICS and DL/1 on an IBM 4300 toPC/Focus on a local area network.andM;&quot;We have saved $800,000 per year, improved productivity and made ourapplications easier to use.andP;  Our databases are 100 megabytes in size andperformance is better than it was on the mainframe,&quot; Gold said.andM;Software AG's Doug Henrich, Natural product manager, maintains thatNatural-written applications perform as well or better than Cobolapplications on mainframes.andM;Distributed processing allows for functions within an application to beperformed on multiple platforms, with the location of the function beinguser-transparent.andM;One performance goal of Nomad Vista is to provide distributed processing thatis transparent to application logic.andP;  Developers will be able to code andtest applications and decide where the processing should be performed, a Mustspokesperson said.andM;Last October, Information Builders announced it would redesign thearchitecture of Focus for the distributed systems environment (a server-basedarchitecture that combines the Focus language with transparent,cross-platform communications capabilities).andM;DISTRIBUTED FOCUSandM;Information Builders expects the initial phase of the distributed Focusstrategy to yield products that offer data server-based cooperativeprocessing capabilities between PC/Focus and the mainframe utilizing LogicalUnit 2 (LU 2) and LU 6.2 for network communications.andM;Future phases will include products that support remote execution ofcentrally stored application procedures by client applications, according toan Information Builders spokesperson.andP;  Future products will also allow anapplication to execute in multi-vendor networks of dissimilar processors.andM;Computer Associates has announced CA-ACE (Application ConstructionEnvironment), which combines two complementary technologies: the cooperativeprocesing facilities of CA-ADS and CA-ADS/PC, and the distributed databasedfacilities of CA-DB:Star.andP;  The technologies will be incorporated in the otherdatabases and development systems within the CA-ACE architecture.andM;Software AG's Henrich says, &quot;In about one year, Natural will distributeapplications between OS/2, Macintosh and Unix environments.andP;  We plan onmanaging communications between workstations and the mainframe.&quot;andM;Some 4GL vendors are planning for an object-oriented design.andP;  According toDave Mallonee, director of product development at On-Line Software, &quot;Accessto data using the Ramis reporting language will be object-oriented.andP;  Userswill be able to report from objects rather than needing to know the files towhich they belong or the relationships between data.&quot;andM;According to Peter Madams, marketing director of Case products at Ingres,recent enhancements to the Ingres database include an object manager whichprovides the ability to manage objects and a knowledge manager which allowsrules and triggers to be stored in the database.andM;Fourth-generation languages provide productivity benefits during a project'sprogramming phase.andP;  However, they offer few advantages during the planning,analysis and design phases.andP;  4GLs are good prototyping tools and can be usedduring analysis to capture user requirements.andM;To enhance and broaden the use of 4GLs for structured applicationsdevelopment, many 4GL vendors are offering an open architecture to interfacewith the upper Case tools for planning, analysis and design.andM;According to George van Schaick, vice president of marketing for ComputerAssociates, &quot;We want to open up our products to other Case tools.andP;  Ourrepository will coexist with the IBM repository.&quot;andM;Peter MacKinnon, director of corporate development for Cognos of Ottawa,Ontario, describes the interface between Excelerator, a Case too from IndexTechnology, Cambridge, Mass., and its PowerHouse 4GL as bi-directional.andM;The current Case product, Phlex, acts as a bridge, enabling Excelerator to beused as a front end to automate the design of Power-House applications.andO;Phlex modifies the Excelerator dictionary to store PowerHouse entities andruns in the VAX environment.andM;EXCELERATOR LINKSandM;&quot;In the new release Phlex was reengineered to be bi-directional and will alsorun in the HP environment.andP;  The interface will be more generic so thatPowerHouse will be able to interface with other Case tools,&quot; MacKinnon said.andM;Magna also has a two-way link to Excelerator.andP;  Kent Lawson, president ofMagna, says, &quot;The Magna application generator has the look and feel ofExcelerator.andP;  Existing applications may be re-engineered back to the visualanalysis phase of a project for maintenance purposes.andP;  We are able to go backto the analysis diagrams from the Cobol code that was previously generated byMagna.&quot;andM;Dennis Butler of Cincom describes a gateway that can be used to plug into anyCase tool or IBM's planned Repository Manager.andP;  An open interface is plannedthat will generate Mantis applications.andM;Software AG is developing a facility called Predict Gateway that will providean open interface to link to Case tools such as IEW, IEF from TexasInstruments, Plano, Texas, Excelerator and others.andP;  Software AG also plans tointerface to the IBM Repository.andM;For upper Case facilities, most 4GL vendors are interfacing to existing Casetools.andM;For upper Case facilities, most 4GL vendors are interfacing to existing Casetools.andM;For lower Case capabilities or code generation, they are developing their owntools.andP;  To be most effective, the toolset must be fully integrated from upperCase to lower Case.andP;  Lawson describes the Magna solution to integration asconsisting of &quot;middle Case,&quot; or visual programming.andM;CASE: INTEGRAL TO THE SOLUTIONandM;Many 4GL vendors see Case as an integral part of the 4GL solution and areracing to deliver products.andP;  Products to be delivered over the next few yearswill likely be just partial solutions.andP;  Until the IBM Repository is in placeand the products are fully integrated, Case benfits will not be fullyrealized.andM;Information Builders has scheduled a first quarter delivery of a productcalled Fact or Focus Application Creation Tool.andM;The company claims Fact will generate standard Focus code from diagramscreated with the workstation's graphics tools.andP;  Fact will also let usersautomatically build file descriptions, input/output screens, procedures,reports and documentation, according to a spokesperson from InformationBuilders.andM;Initial availability will be on OS/2 Presentation Manager, Sun and DECwindowworkstations.andP;  It also complies with IBM' SAA and DEC's NAS.andM;Fact is being developed using VSF, a Case development product designed andmarketed by Systematica, Ltd. of the United Kingdom (Dorset, England).andM;Computer Associates is working on the problem of making the connectionbetween upper and lower Case.andP;  Its analysis tool, IDMS Architect, puts designinformation into the IDMS dictionary.andM;The company also has a program generation technology, called CADB:Generator,which generates C, Fortran, Cobol and Basic in the VAX environment; ADS onthe PC and mainframe; and is working to generate Cobol and other languages inmore environments.andM;According to MacKinnon, Cognos has a three-tiered case strategy.andP;  The firstcomponent will link to other Case tools while developing its own Case tools,using the VSF Case development tool from Systematica.andM;Included in this offering is a product under development called &quot;The AnalystWorkbench,&quot; which supports a specific Cognos methodology and implementationlanguage.andM;The PowerDesign method is Cognos' solution for the analysis, design andconstruction of PowerHouse 4GL applications.andM;The third component deals with the next generation of knowledge-basedsystems, or programming in graphical form with rules.andM;Cincom has developed alliances with Case vendors to form the &quot;Cincom AdvancedSoftware Engineering Environment&quot; which consists of Mantis and an integratedset of Case tools portable across environments such as PCs, mainframes, VAXunder VMS, Honeywell Bull and NCR.andM;The alliances have provided links to Excelerator, Leverage and PersonalLeverage from Dan Appleton (Dacom), Manhattan Beach, Calif., and an expertsystem product from Aion Corp., Palo Alto, Calif.andP;  Information extracted fromthe Excelerator Dictionary produces database design, screen layouts anddocumentation for the Mantis application.andM;Personal Leverage, a customized version of Excelerator, supports a particularmethodology.andP;  Leverage is a host-based diagramming facility handling largediagrams which cannot be supported on the PC.andM;NATURAL ADDITIONSandM;In October 1989, Software AG announced the addition of Predict Case version 2to its Natural Engineering Series set of integrated 4GL Case products.andP;  Thisproduct merges front-end Case tools with an object-oriented repository and afourth-generation application delivery environment, using Natural as theexecutable specification language.andM;The product includes: object and set-level repository maintenance,workstation-based diagram generation, a schema generator, a program composerand extensive documentation generation facilities.andM;Software AG also has a lower Case tool called Natural Construct, aforms-based parameterized application generator for Natural, and an upperCase tool called Natural Architect, a Mac-based diagramming tool.andM;Dave Wells, development manager for Washington State University in Pullman,Wash., is a user of Adabas, Natural and Natural Architect.andP;  He successfullyused Natural Architect to introduce Case into his organization.andM;&quot;We have been a beta test user of Predict Case and are now forging ahead withthe use of the product,&quot; Wells said.andP;  &quot;We are able to put together solidNatural programs from logical specifications, or fragments of code.andP;  We nowhave an environment where code is easily reusable.&quot;andM;Oracle has developed a set of Case tools to assist the application developer.andO;Case*Designer is an analysis tool with a graphic user interface that links tothe multiuser repository, Case*Dictionary.andM;The forms-based interface captures information to be stored in thedictionary, such as information models, functional requirements and designdecisions.andM;From the dictionary, database designs are crated and that information is usedby Case*Generator.andP;  The generator currently generates forms, but is expectedto generate reports.andP;  Case*Method is Oracle's structured development method.andM;Ingres has teamed with Cadre to provide an integrated Case offering.andP;  Thecurrent Ingres/Teamwork product generates the Ingres database from theinformation produced by the Teamwork analysis and design tool.andM;In the future, they plan to add reverse engineering and code generationfacilities.andP;  The two companies have built an IRDS-based repository and planto interface with IBM's repository and DEC's CDD/Plus repository.andM;As Case tools become more widely used there will be a tight coupling of&quot;application developer 4GLs&quot; and Case products.andP;  The 4GLs will be integratedinto the Case environment.andP;  They will interface to upper Case tools, accessthe IBM and DEC repository, and generate 4GL, and in some cases, 3GL code.andO;Prototyping will be done with the 4GL instead of the Case tool as soon asreverse engineering or two-way links become available.andM;EXPANDING 4GL LIFESPANandM;When this level of integration is achieved between 4GLs and Case, end userswill use Case tools.andP;  Application developers may elect to use Case or the 4GLcommand language, depending upon the nature of the application.andM;According to Patrick Brennan, data administration consultant for Unisys inArlington, Va., &quot;Case is used for permanent application development.andP;  4GLsare used when users need information right away.&quot;andM;Peter Madams of Ingres says, &quot;4GLs are a productivity step along the way tobuilding a production system.andP;  Case is a formal environment to documentanalysis and design decisions, and capture data definitions.&quot;andM;Even after the Case tools are mature and it is no longer necessary tomaintain code, 4GLs will still be needed for reporting, prototyping andspecifying complex processing logic.andM;According to Feldman of Hughes Space and Communications, &quot;The benefitsderived from combining 4GL and Case technology are greater than the sum ofthe individual parts.&quot;andM;Case is expanding the life span and usefulness of 4GLs, in addition toproviding the key to better quality systems.andM;Weitz is vice president of systems and applications consulting for Mathtech,Inc., a professional services firm based in Princeton, N.J., and FallsChurch, Va.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
