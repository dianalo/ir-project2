Moody's Investors Service Inc. is studying the legislation's implications for such creditors, especially holders of standby letters of credit issued by banks. The law gives the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. wide latitude in deciding what obligations of failed banks it will accept.    Christopher Mahoney, a Moody's analyst, said, &quot;We've not taken any action as yet, but this bill could affect ratings on letters of credit. We will be issuing a comment sometime in the future.&quot;    Banks' legal advisers agreed that the law could lead to widespread downgradings in the ratings on certain bank obligations. One bank adviser said, &quot;This is going to make U.S. banks less competitive with foreign banks on letters of credit. It could also affect deposits in foreign branches.&quot; Another bank attorney added, &quot;A lot will depend on how the FDIC chooses to implement the law.&quot;    A standby letter of credit enables the creditor of a third party to draw against the bank's funds if the third party fails to live up to contractual obligations. Letters of credit are used routinely to enhance the credit-worthiness of securities.    Generally, banks' standby letters of credit have carried identical ratings to insured deposits, based on the assumption that the FDIC would honor insured as well as uninsured obligations of individual banks, if not their parent companies.    The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act signed by President Bush Wednesday gives the FDIC wide discretion to choose which obligations of failed banks it will assume and which will be left with the failed bank.    The FDIC has signaled its desire to reduce the cost of bank bailouts by gradually narrowing the types of obligations that it will honor. Earlier this year, when it declared most of Dallas-based MCorp's 25 banks insolvent, the FDIC for the first time chose not to assume the failed banks' standby letters of credit, according to Moody's. Holders of those obligations are challenging that decision in court.    But, if some bankers fear the new law's repercussions, others are cheered by provisions that will greatly reduce the amounts of capital that U.S. banks will have to set aside for their portfolios of interest and currency swaps.    In a swap contract, banks enable a party with floating-rate debt, for instance, to reduce the risks of higher rates by exchanging their payment obligations with a party that has fixed-rate debt. The new legislation allows banks to set aside capital based on the net rather than the gross amount of their swaps exposure. The change should also reduce the costs of swaps arranged by U.S. banks and give them a competitive advantage over foreign banks and investment banks.    Mark C. Brickell, a vice president of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. of New York and president of the International Swap Dealers Association, said, &quot;This frees up millions of dollars in bank capital systemwide and reduces the amount of interbank exposure by billions.&quot;    Mr. Brickell said the association is urging Congress and foreign bank regulators to adopt the same netting provisions for investment banks and foreign banks. </TEXT></DOC>
