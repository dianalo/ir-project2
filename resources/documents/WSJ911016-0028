In the year-earlier quarter, the instant photographyconcern had net of $31.3 million, or 42 cents a share. Salesrose 2.4% to $474.6 million from $463.7 million.</LP><TEXT>   The company said U.S. sales rose 8%, reflecting &quot;marketinginvestments to enlarge the number of instant photographyusers.&quot; Overseas revenue fell &quot;moderately&quot; because of&quot;currency exchange factors and an unfavorable comparison withlast year's burst of sales from East Germany,&quot; said I.MacAllister Booth, chairman, president and chief executiveofficer.   Third-quarter operating profit fell 21% to $47.2 millionfrom $59.7 million a year earlier as a result ofmanufacturing and research and engineering start-up costs fornew products, the company said.   Excluding both the Kodak settlement gain and interestearned on it, Polaroid's operating earnings fell more than50% to about 18 cents a share, said B. Alex Henderson, ananalyst with Prudential Securities Research. The operatingresults were &quot;dismal but not that surprising,&quot; he added,given that margins were down and that Polaroid had a highertax rate.   Polaroid said its effective tax rate for the third quarterwas 36%, compared with 28% a year earlier.   Polaroid used part of its proceeds from the Kodaksettlement to repay $162 million of bank debt. The companyalso used some proceeds to retire the $300 million inpreferred stock held by investment fund Corporate PartnersL.P., which was exchanged for $280 million in cash and $140million in convertible debentures. Polaroid added that usingthe settlement proceeds, it will distribute $30 million inincentive awards to its employees and buy back $150 millionof common stock.   In the first nine months, net was $625.2 million, or$11.18 a share, including the gain from the settlement.Year-earlier profit was $96 million, or $1.31 a share. Salesrose 4.5% to $1.44 billion from $1.38 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
