This paper describes acurrent transformer model including the representation of core saturationand remanent magnetization. A comparison between test measurements andcomputer simulation results is carried out. The conditions for a real-timeapplication of an algorithm based on this model are discussed in thefinal part of this paper.</TEXT></DOC>
