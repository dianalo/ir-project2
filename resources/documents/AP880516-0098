(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Presidential candidate Jesse Jacksonappealed again today for fairness from the Democratic Party, saying``fairness is a reasonable expectation.''   Jackson has complained in recent weeks that his delegate totalis not proportional to his hard-won share of the popular vote inprimaries to date.   ``Fairness is a reasonable expectation. Reciprocity is areasonable expectation. We expect to treat the party fair becausewe expect to be treated fairly by the party,'' he told reportershere.   Asked what he would do if he did not win the nomination, Jacksonreplied:   ``We hope to have enough popular vote and delegates (for thenomination),'' he said. ``And then we'll determine the ticket ofour party and the platform of our party and the priorities of ourparty.''   Jackson made a quick swing through New Jersey Sunday and todaybefore heading to Oregon for a final day of campaigning in advanceof the state's primary on Tuesday.   On Sunday, under the massive dome of the Hopewell BaptistChurch, Jackson drew on religious themes of hope and faith as hevowed to keep up his campaign for the Democratic presidentialnomination.   ``We've come too far to turn around now,'' he told the mostlyblack crowd. ``In our own lifetime we've moved from the back of thebus to three steps from the White House.''   Jackson said he was the only candidate committed to sweepingeconomic reforms that would benefit working people.   ``This is not about black fish and white fish but about big fishand little fish,'' Jackson said, to applause.   Jackson called for raising the minimum wage, working to bringwomen's wages in line with those of men, earmarking defense fundsto education instead and providing universal health insurance. Healso outlined plans for providing affordable housing and day care.   He attacked the Reagan administration's foreign and domesticpolicies, including Vice President George Bush, the apparentRepublican nominee, in each criticism.   Jackson faulted the administration for a failed ``courtship''with Panamanian leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and for allowingU.S. companies to move out of the country in order to pay cheaperwages.   Jackson appealed for votes in the New Jersey primary, which isJune 7.   ``No valley is too deep when our minds are made up,'' he said.``We're winning every day. That's what makes the New Jersey race soimportant. It's a matter of pulling your weight in New Jersey.''   At the state Democratic convention in South Orange, N.J.,Jackson noted pointedly that he, unlike rival Michael Dukakis, hasgarnered few big-name endorsements.   ``I haven't inherited any voters. I've earned every vote I'vegained,'' he said.   Dukakis also appeared at the Democratic event, and the two metbriefly.</TEXT></DOC>
