Government Securities Inc. to stiff jail terms, in one case overruling pleas for leniency from prosecutors and a Securities and Exchange Commission official.    Ronnie R. Ewton and George Mead were handcuffed and led from the courtroom to begin sentences of nine years and six years, respectively, in the Ohio Penitentiary. The judge made both sentences consecutive to the federal terms, rejecting prosecutors' recommendations that the sentences be made concurrent to federal sentences due to start in a few months.    &quot;It would be a subversion of justice if a man who stole $200 million could serve his time at an Air Force base, (not) a real prison,&quot; said Judge Fred J. Cartolano in a harsh, 10-minute speech during Mr. Ewton's sentencing hearing. Both defendants had requested that they serve their federal terms at Eglin Air Force Base, a minimum security facility, in Florida.    Fort Lauderdale-based E.S.M., now in bankruptcy-law proceedings, was closed in 1985 after the SEC charged the firm with fraud. Its collapse triggered the failure of one Ohio savings and loan association, the closing of all Ohio's state-insured thrifts, and a temporary sell-off of the dollar in international markets. E.S.M.'s collapse also caused millions of dollars in losses to Ohio schools and municipalities.    Messrs. Ewton and Mead, co-founders of E.S.M., entered plea bargains with federal officials last year, admitting to various conspiracy and fraud charges, and agreed to cooperate with both federal and state investigations. However, the judge isn't bound to prosecutors' recommendations.    The sentences surprised both prosecutors and defendants; Mr. Mead's Miami attorneys hadn't come up for the sentencing. Defense attorneys said they were considering options in appealing the sentences. Several attorneys in the case said the defendants may be able to appeal to the federal judge to change his sentence, for example by making it concurrent with the state sentence or, for the same purpose, designating the state prison as a federal prison.    William Cagney, Mr. Mead's attorney in Miami, also argued that Lawrence A. Kane, the Ohio special prosecutor, had &quot;clearly breached&quot; a plea-bargain agreement that would have had Judge Cartolano sentence Mr. Mead before the federal judge did. He said he would appeal the sentence on that basis. Mr. Kane said &quot;we have adhered to our agreements&quot; and noted that Mr. Mead's local attorney, who attended the sentencing, hadn't raised that point at the hearing.    Arguing for leniency for Mr. Ewton, prosecutors and Charles Harper, SEC associate regional commissioner from Florida, lauded Mr. Ewton's honesty, repentance and cooperation, which they said had saved them time and money.    But Judge Cartolano scoffed at these arguments, adding that neither man was in court &quot;to be sentenced on the degree of your cooperation.&quot; He charged Mr. Ewton with &quot;picking the pocket of every citizen in this state&quot; to live the good life.    He noted that a series of prosecution witnesses hadn't appeared on behalf of Mr. Mead, as they had for Mr. Ewton, and quizzed Mr. Mead about how he had spent millions in salary and loans from E.S.M., repeatedly demanding, &quot;What happened to that money?&quot;    Mr. Ewton was sentenced to nine years in the Ohio Penitentiary, to be served consecutively to his federal term of 15 years. Prosecutors had recommended a seven-year sentence to be served concurrently. Mr. Ewton also was fined $27,000. Mr. Mead was sentenced to seven years, with one year concurrent to the other six, but the six years consecutive to a 14-year federal term. He was fined $17,000.    Judge Cartolano has a reputation as a very tough judge, and Mr. Mead's local counsel, Martin Pinales, called him &quot;consistent.&quot; Nonetheless, Mr. Pinales added, &quot;Mr. Boesky didn't help,&quot; alluding to the Ivan F. Boesky insider-trading case on Wall Street that has raised public hackles about lenient treatment for white-collar criminals.    However, several attorneys in the case suggested that the judge was acting &quot;politically&quot; in order to grab local headlines and influence the outcome of a related trial due to go to the jury today or tomorrow. Closing arguments will continue today in the fraud trial of Marvin Warner, the former head of Home State Savings, the Ohio thrift whose collapse followed that of E.S.M. </TEXT></DOC>
