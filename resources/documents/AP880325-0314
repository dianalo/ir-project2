Pistor Jr., chairman of troubled FirstRepublicBank Corp.'s flagship bank will retire early, but notbecause of the bank's financial problems.

The FDIC gave First Republic a $1 billion capital loan last weekto stem a serious outflow of deposits.   Bank officials are expected to recommend that Gerald W.Fronterhouse, the corporation's chairman and chief executiveofficer, assume Pistor's position.   ``With the FDIC's stabilizing assistance and assurance that alldepositors are fully protected, the permanent solutions andrestructuring of First RepublicBank are beginning, and I have askedJerry (Fronterhouse) not to consider me for responsibilities in theongoing institution,'' Pistor stated.   The company also announced Thursday that Joseph R. Musolino,vice chairman of First RepublicBank, was elected company president.Fronterhouse will continue serving as chairman.   Although senior First RepublicBank executives had agreed toresign if asked by the FDIC, as a condition of the $1 billion loan,FDIC spokesman Alan Whitney said Pistor's resignation had not beensought.
