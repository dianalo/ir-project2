Early Tuesday in Austria, 10 of the 13 oil ministers ofthe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decidedthey would endorse plans by three leading OPEC members toproduce a total of as much as three million barrels a daybeyond their current OPEC quotas.</LP><TEXT>   At the same time the ministers were working out thatsettlement, oil prices were plummeting as much as $4 abarrel, largely on the possibility of negotiations in thestandoff in the Persian Gulf. The OPEC talks aimed atauthorizing more oil production added to the selling binge.   In the sharpest one-day decline in the four years ofrecords kept by the New York Mercantile Exchange, thebenchmark U.S. crude for October delivery plunged $4 a barrelto $26.91. Brent crude in the spot market for Septemberdelivery tumbled $3.65 a barrel to $27.55.   Gasoline for September delivery also fell sharply, by17.10 cents a gallon to 87.56 cents. Heating oil for the samemonth declined 12.86 cents to 78.10 cents a gallon.   John Lichtblau, chairman of Petroleum Industry ResearchFoundation, attributed the price decline to &quot;the realizationthat Iraq and the U.S. may try to negotiate their way out ofthe crisis rather than go to war with each other.&quot;   Despite yesterday's drop, petroleum prices are still 35%above the level of Aug. 1, the day before the Mideast crisisbegan. OPEC has sought in recent years to stabilize oilprices and markets after a long series of wild pricegyrations. Many OPEC ministers fear a new round of runawayprices would trigger recessions in the industrializedeconomies and ultimately lead to another big loss in theirshare of world energy markets.   &quot;I would prefer prices of $21 to $25 a barrel for oneyear,&quot; said Ginandjar Kartasasmita, Indonesia's oil ministerin an interview last night.   Under the tentative agreement among a majority of OPECministers, Saudi Arabia will be allowed to produce twomillion barrels a day more, pushing its total output to 7.4million barrels a day. Venezuela, which has an OPEC quota of1.9 million barrels a day, will be cleared to produce as muchas 500,000 a day more -- with most of that attainable withinthe next couple of weeks. The United Arab Emirates, which hasa current quota of 1.5 million barrels a day, will be clearedto go back to its recent rate of two million barrels a day.   The combined extra output from these three will make upmost of the four million barrel shortage created by theglobal embargo against Iraqi and Kuwaiti crudes.   It has been clear since early this month that SaudiArabia, Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates were preparedto boost output even if OPEC wouldn't &quot;bless&quot; such a move. Infact, it is understood the three have already begun pumpingmore oil, though Venezuela has claimed it has been storingits extra output.   But they wanted the full endorsement of OPEC, preferablyvia a formal emergency conference. Though chances of thatfaded quickly here over the weekend, the tentative agreementarising from informal talks will satisfy the three nations.   An Indonesian proposal formed the basis of the tentativeagreement. Under it, the three countries -- which have thebulk of the current extra capacity within OPEC -- wouldincrease output for the duration of the crisis, with theunderstanding the three countries would return to theirquotas when the crisis ends. In exchange, OPEC would call onoil-consuming nations to dip into their commercial andgovernment inventories to help make up the rest of theshortfall and help take care of anticipated rising demandlater this year. Developing countries, hard hit by escalatingoil prices, would receive priority in the distribution of theadded supplies.   Ministers are expected to meet later Tuesday to completethe agreement. Last night, several said they hoped to get an11th member, Iran, to go along.   Iran has opposed a production increase at this time, andyesterday's price drop seemed to help its case. Iran hasargued that world oil supplies still are plentiful despitethe embargo, and that recent price runups reflectedpsychological rather than fundamental factors.   &quot;We oppose an increase in production at this time,&quot; said asenior Iran delegate. &quot;We shouldn't decide on this whilethere is so much tension&quot; in world oil markets, he said.   The two remaining OPEC members, Iraq and Libya, alsooppose any output boosts. The Iraqi oil minister hasn'tappeared for the talks here; there were some reports that theLibyan minister might show up Tuesday.   Yesterday's steep price decline &quot;was more abrupt than Iwould have imagined,&quot; said Tom Burns, manager of economicsfor Chevron Corp. But he called the drop an almost inevitable&quot;clear reaction to the semi-panic buying of the last eight to10 days which carried prices to above $30 a barrel.&quot; Thelatest sell-off brings crude down by about $6 a barrel sinceThursday.   Mr. Burns noted that oil inventories are still high. Thethreat of war dictates whether those inventories areconsidered a valued cushion or simple surplus, he explained.&quot;Whether the extra barrels are an overhang or not is in theeye of the beholder,&quot; Mr. Burns said. &quot;It's largelyperception.&quot;   Despite the sharp price decline and the tentativeagreement to boost OPEC output, oil strategists say priceswon't continue to fall sharply. Many consider $25 to $30 abarrel realistic -- which still would be far above the pricesin the high teens earlier this year.   &quot;We're not home free yet,&quot; said Mr. Lichtblau of thePetroleum Industry Research Foundation. &quot;The extra pricingreflecting anticipated warfare may have disappeared. But evenif we make up for much of the Iraqi-Kuwaiti shortfall, thesupply situation going into the winter will be precarious.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
