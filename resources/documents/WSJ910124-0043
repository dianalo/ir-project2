The lawsuit, filed in 1989, accused the New York Times ofrunning real-estate ads that almost exclusively featuredwhite models and that communicated a &quot;whites only&quot; message topotential customers.</LP><TEXT>   The Times argued that the lawsuit should be dismissedbecause it would be unconstitutional to require newspapers tomonitor the ads. It also contended that because the activitybeing advertised, real-estate sales or rentals, is legal, therestrictions were a violation of advertisers' free-speechrights.   But the appeals court, upholding a U.S. district judge'sruling that the case could go to trial, said the restrictionsaren't a violation of commercial free speech because the adsallegedly promoted illegal discrimination. Commercial speechis given less constitutional protection than other forms ofexpression.   The appeals court also said that because the Times alreadyroutinely monitors ads for various reasons, includingdeceptive claims or indecent language, &quot;it strains thecredulity beyond the breaking point to assert that monitoringads for racial messages imposes an unconstitutional burden.&quot;   Nancy Nielsen, a spokeswoman for the New York Times, said,&quot;We are studying the decision to see how next to proceed. TheNew York Times has long been at the forefront of the fightfor equal opportunity in housing, and we will continue tosupport the efforts to promote racial equality.&quot;   But Ms. Nielsen added, &quot;We believe that under ourConstitution, it is improper for the New York Times to beplaced in the position of enforcing a law which . . . makespublishers monitor the content of the ads of its clients onan ongoing basis.&quot;   P. Cameron DeVore, a First Amendment specialist at theSeattle law firm of Davis, Wright andamp; Tremaine, said thedecision &quot;is a real invasion of First Amendment protectionfor advertising. . . . The real-estate developer may haveknown that the ad was discriminatory, but the newspaper hadno way of knowing that.&quot;   In its ruling, the court also addressed the issue of whatmakes a real-esate ad discriminatory under the Fair HousingAct. The court said the racial makeup of models in areal-estate ad can violate the Fair Housing law if it sends aracist signal to consumers. &quot;Neither the text of the statutenor its legislative history suggests that Congress intendedto exempt . . . subtle methods of indicating racialpreferences,&quot; the court said.   The court said the law requires that real-estateadvertisers not use models in ways &quot;that create a suggestionof a racial preference. The deliberate inclusion of a blackmodel where necessary to avoid such a message seems to us afar cry from the alleged practices that are at the core ofthe debate over quotas.&quot;   The suit, which was brought by a housing-advocacy groupand several black people who were looking for housing in NewYork, still has to go to trial to determine whether theplaintiffs can prove their factual allegations.   ---   WHISTLE-BLOWER law for bank employees tested in suitagainst NCNB unit.   A former top real-estate appraiser, W. John Ellis, allegesthat NCNB Corp.'s NCNB Texas National Bank unit wrongfullyfired him for providing information to the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and theOffice of the Controller of the Currency. The information,according to the suit, concerns real-estate assets acquiredby NCNB from a failed Texas bank.   An NCNB Texas spokesman said bank policy prohibits commenton pending litigation. An FBI spokesman in Dallas said theagency would neither confirm nor deny that agents had spokenwith Mr. Ellis or that a probe is under way.   Mr. Ellis claims that he should have been protected fromfiring under provisions of the federal financial institutionsreform legislation that took effect in August 1989. Thelegislation provides &quot;a special species of whistle-blowerprotection&quot; for employees of banks and thrifts, says Mr.Ellis's attorney, labor specialist Hal Gillespie of Dallas.Mr. Gillespie, who filed a suit on behalf of Mr. Ellis inDallas federal court last week, says he doesn't know of anycases that have been decided under the law.   In his suit against the bank and four of its officers, Mr.Ellis says he was providing the FBI and bank regulators withinformation about the undervaluation of real estate that wasin the portfolio of the old RepublicBank Corp. of Dallas.   RepublicBank merged with InterFirst Corp. in June 1987. Atthe time, Mr. Ellis was manager of the real-estate appraisaldepartment at InterFirst, where he had worked since 1965. Mr.Ellis, 62 years old, alleges that RepublicBank usedfraudulent appraisals of real estate that it financed toinflate its value in the merger. The combined bank, FirstRepublicBank Corp., failed in 1988, and NCNB acquired thefailed bank units and some assets in a deal with the FDIC.   Mr. Ellis says he informed his superiors at NCNB of theallegedly fraudulent appraisals and claims they took noaction. Mr. Ellis, fired in November, seeks unspecifieddamages.   ---   LOOKING AHEAD: The government of Kuwait in exile hasauthorized the appointment of a legal committee to processdamage claims resulting from Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.
