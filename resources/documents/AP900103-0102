LIM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   South Korea's unification minister hasdeclared an ``era of exchange'' in its relations with North Korea,urging the communist nation to open economic and non-politicalcooperation on the divided peninsula.   ``The year 1990 will be an era of exchange,'' UnificationMinister Lee Hong-koo said in an interview with Yonhap, the SouthKorean news agency, published Wednesday.   He said South Korea will seek active dialogue with North Koreaand that a government fund would be set up to expedite economiccooperation and other exchanges. He said the fund would besubsidized by private business groups anxious to initiate trade andinvestment with North Korea.   Lee was skeptical about any immediate change in North Koreaunder the unchallenged leadership of President Kim Il Sung and saidnon-political exchanges must precede politics to end decades-longdistrust between the two rivals.   He said South Korea's basic unification policy was aimed atgradual disarmament after signing a peace treaty with North Korea.``Talks on arms reduction must be held after the two Koreas declarea non-aggression pact,'' he said.   South Koreans would be allowed gradually to watch North Koreantelevision and read the Communist Party newspaper, Lee said. SomeNorth Korean TV programming already is available in South Korea.   In a New Year's speech, Kim proposed talks on breaking down aconcrete border wall to ensure free travel between the nations,reiterating a call for a conference that would include leaders ofSeoul's government and opposition parties.   Kim said he was ready to remove ``barbed wires which mark aboundary,'' contending no border barrier exists on the North Koreanside.   A South Korean government statement called Kim's proposal``empty propaganda'' intended to avoid international and internalpressure to open Pyongyang's closed society.   ``There is no concrete barrier in our area south of thedemarcation line,'' said a South Korean government statement. Itsaid Kim's New Year call was intended to ``dilute our initiatives''in unification talks.   North Korea invaded South Korea in 1950, triggering a three-yearwar, and a peace treaty was never signed.   They are separated by the 2{-mile-wide demilitarized zone undera 1953 armistice, but the border on both sides is sealed byconcrete bunkers, mine fields, barbed wires, and heavily armedsoldiers.   Outside the DMZ and on roads leading to it, South Korea hasbuilt up roadblocks, concrete walls and other obstacles to guardagainst surprise attacks.   North Korea pushed for military talks with South Korea lastyear, but Seoul claims people, political and cultural exchangetalks must be held before military discussions. Little progress hasbeen made in the talks with each side insisting on its ownproposals.   Seoul officials believe North Korea has never given up itsintention to communize South Korea and that its proposals have beenaimed at inciting unrest and forcing the withdrawal of 43,000 U.S.forces stationed in South Korea.</TEXT></DOC>
