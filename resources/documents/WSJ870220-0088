Upjohn said it expects to begin certain clinical trials on the compound, called CCA, in the U.S. by early 1988. Upjohn said it will attempt to demonstrate that CCA affects the underlying cause of arthritis, rather than being only an anti-inflammatory agent, like other anti-arthritis drugs.    Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, discovered the compound. Its chemical name is disodium 4-chloro-2, 2'-iminodibenzoate. CCA currently is marketed in Japan.    Upjohn, which makes health care and agricultural products, said it has granted Chugai rights to a compound to be named later in exchange for the license on CCA. </TEXT></DOC>
