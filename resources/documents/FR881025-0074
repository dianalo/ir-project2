The following summary also contains a list of submissions thatwere dismissed by the Office of Hearings and Appeals. <ITAG tagnum="84">Appeals </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Arent, Fox Kintner, Plotkin andamp; Kahn, 9/20/88, KFA-0211</T3>The law firm of Arent, Fox, Kintner, Plotkin andamp; Kahn filed an Appealfrom a denial by the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) of a Requestfor Information which the firm had submitted under the Freedom of InformationAct (FOIA). In considering the Appeal, the DOE found that the BPA correctlywithheld labor unit prices and prompt payment discounts in a service contract,pursuant to Exemption 4 of the FOIA. The DOE found that in the contextof this contract, the release of this information could reveal confidentialpricing strategy and profit information. The DOE further found that evenif contractual terms were arrived at through arm's-length negotiations,the terms were still ``obtained from a person'' for the pruposes of Exemption4. Finally, the DOE, in reliance on an opinion of the Comptroller General,determined that the Federal Acquisition Regulation does not apply to BPAand, therefore, does not require BPA to release unit prices. <ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Glen Milner, 9/23/88, KFA-0216 </T3>Mr. Glen Milner filed an Appeal from a denial by the Deputy Director, Officeof Intergovernmental and External Affairs, Albuquerque Operations Office(the Authorizing Official) of a Request for Information which he had submittedunder the Freedom of Information Act. Mr. Milner noted that only one pageof a DOE technical manual was treated as responsive to his request, andargued that the entire document should have been released to him. In consideringthe Appeal, the DOE found that it was entirely reasonable for the AuthorizingOfficial to have interpreted Mr. Milner's request in the manner that hedid and to have restricted his analysis to the relevant page of the technicalmanual. The DOE upheld the Authorizing Official's determination with respectto that page and remanded the matter for a determination concerning theremainder of the document. <ITAG tagnum="84">Remedial Orders</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Tesoro Petroleum Corporation, 9/23/88, HRO-0143 </T3>The DOE issued a Remedial Order to Tesoro Petroleum Company (Tesoro). Inthe Remedial Order, the DOE found that during the months of October andNovember 1977, Tesoro violated the entitlements reporting regulations codifiedat 10 CFR 211.66 and 211.67 and the circumvention regulation set forthat 10 CFR 205.202. Specifically, the DOE found that Tesoro entered intoa series of crude oil sales, processing and refined product transactionswhich permitted the firm to shift the reporting of large volumes of price-controlledcrude oil from itself to a refiner which was excepted from 100 percentof its entitlement purchase obligations under the Entitlements Program.According to the DOE, Tesoro masterminded a scheme to circumvent the letterand spirit of the DOE regulations by using an excepted refiner as titleholderto the crude oil and interjecting unnecessary intermediaries into the crudeoil distribution chain. The DOE determined that the scheme was designedto enable Tesoro to mask its exclusive physical control and possessionof the crude oil and to exclude the crude oil from its crude oil runs tostills on its Refiners' Monthly Reports. By excluding the crude oil fromits Refiners' Monthly Reports, Tesoro was able to circumvent the entitlementsreporting regulations and concomitantly reap a profit at the expense ofthe Entitlements Program. The DOE ordered Tesoro to refund the sum, $2,869,779,plus interest, which represents the amount of profit Tesoro unjustly receivedas the result of its scheme to reduce its costs under the EntitlementsProgram. <ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Texas American Oil Corportion, 9/19/88, KRO-0360 </T3>Texas American Oil Corporation (Texas American) filed a Statement of Objectionsto a Proposed Remedial Order (PRO) that was issued to the firm by the economicRegulatory Administration (ERA) on September 30, 1986. In the PRO, theERA alleged that in its Refiners' Monthly Reports during the period October1976 through February 1977, Texas American's wholly-owned subsidiary, TexasAmerican Petrochemicals, Inc. (TAPI), misreported certain crude oil subjectto ``processing agreements'' and thereby received excessive small refinerbias (SRB) benefits under DOE's Entitlements Program, 10 CFR 211.66, inviolation of 10 CFR 211.67(e)(2). In the alternative, the ERA alleged thatTAPI's transactions involving that crude oil resulted in the circumventionor contravention of the Entitlements Program, in violation of 10 CFR 205.202.In considering Texas American's Statement of Objections, the DOE rejectedTexas American's contentions that: (i) The ERA misapplied andSection; 211.67(e)(2)to the processing agreements at issue, (ii) the enforcement proceedingwas barred by the termination of the DOE's Entitlements Program and bythe Stripper Well Settlement Agreement, and (iii) Texas American shouldnot be held solely liable for restitution of the illicit entitlements benefits.Since the DOE sustained the andSection; 211.67(e)(2) violations, the DOEfound that it was unnecessary to address the alternative andSection; 205.202violation alleged by the ERA. Accordingly, the PRO was issued as a finalRemedial Order, and Texas American was required to refund the full amountof excessive SRB benefits received, $330,261, plus interest. <ITAG tagnum="84">Interlocutory Order </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Lajet, Inc., 9/22/88, KRZ-0087</T3>A Deputy Director of the Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a SpecialReport Order (SRO) to LaJet, Inc. (LaJet). The SRO directed the firm toprovide the ERA with certain information and documentary support concerning:(1) The firm's ownership interests in various entities; (2) the flow ofcrude oil among LaJet's suppliers, LaJet, and Young Refining Company; and(3) the transfer of LaJet's stock to Flare Energy Corporation. The DeputyDirector issued the SRO to LaJet during the pendency of a Proposed RemedialOrder proceeding involving the firm because of the procedural posture ofthe enforcement action. <ITAG tagnum="84">Implementation of Special Refund Proceeding </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Murphy Oil Corporation, 9/19/88, KEF-0095 </T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order implementing a plan for the distributionof $7,104,217.29 received pursuant to a Consent Order between Murphy OilCorporation and the DOE that was finalized on February 9, 1987. The DOEdetermined that the consent order funds should be distributed to customersthat purchased covered products from Murphy during the period March 6,1973 through January 27, 1981.

The firm submitted cost banks and market price data which indicatedthat it was forced to absorb Aminoil's alleged overcharges. Therefore,the firm demonstrated that it was injured by Aminoil's alleged overchargesto the full extent of its volumetric allocations of the consent order fund.After examining the firm's application and supporting documentation, theDOE concluded that it should receive a refund totaling $100,609, representing$56,829 in principal and $43,780 in interest.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Aminoil U.S.A., Inc./Rural Gas Company et al., 9/23/88, RF139-69 etal.</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning Applications for Refundfiled by Rural Gas Company, Ford Pinkerton Company and Don Loftis in theAminoil U.S.A., Inc. special refund proceeding. The firms submitted costbanks and market price data which indicates that they were forced to absorbAminoil's alleged overcharges. Therefore, the firms demonstrated that theywere injured to the full extent of their volumertric allocations of theconsent order fund by Aminoil's alleged overcharges. In addition, Ruraland Loftis demonstrated that there was a change in ownership from Ruralto Loftis in the middle of the refund period, and that each is entitledto a refund for its respective portion of the consent order period. Afterexamining the three Applications for Refund and supporting documentation,the DOE granted refunds totaling $170,225, representing $96,168 in principaland $74,087 in interest.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Andale Farmers Cooperative Co., 9/21/88, RF272-7206</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting a refund from crude oil overchargefunds to Andale Farmers Cooperative Co. (Andale) based on its documentedpurchases of refined petroleum products during the period August 19, 1973through January 27, 1981. Since Andale, an agricultural cooperative, establishedthat it would distribute the refund to its members, the application wasgranted. The total amount of the refund approved in this Decision and Orderis $4,236.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Arizona Electric Power Cooperative, 9/23/88, RF272-74899</T3>On August 16, 1988, the DOE had issued a Decision and Order granting arefund of $7,282 to Arizona Electric Power Cooperative (Arizona Electric),Case No. RF272-9358, now designated RF272-74899. <T3>See Roger Brocka, </T3>17 DOE andpara; 85,700 (1988). Arizona Electric'sapplication is one of several subject to a stay of disbursement of funds,<T3>see Pacific Gas andamp; Electric Company, </T3>17 DOE andpara;85,315 (1988).Accordingly, the DOE issued a Supplemental Order rescinding the refundgranted to Arizona Electric.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Atlantic Richfield Company, Jubilee Oil Company Et Al., 9/21/88, FR304-200Et Al.</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning twenty Applications forRefund filed by fifteen firms from a consent order fund made availableby Atlantic Richfield Company. As resellers/retailers applying for smallrefunds or end-users these firms were presumed to have been injured. TheDOE found that these firms should receive refunds totalling $21,995, representing$17,609 in principal and $4,186 in interest.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Coline Gasoline Corp./Pennsylvania, RM2-115; National Helium Corp./Pennsylvania,RM3-116; Pennzoil Company/Pennsylvania, RM10-117; Standard Oil Co.

(Indiana)refund proceedings. Pennsylvania requested permission to expand its oilfurnace retrofit program for low-income households to all types of fuel-burningfurnaces in such households. Funding for the expanded program would comefrom $3,889,699 previously approved in the above proceedings and $433,301in interest that had accrued on those funds, for a total planned expenditureof $4,323,000. Though the expanded program would benefit low-income householdsthat do not use refined petroleum products for heating, the DOE approvedthe program because of the likelihood that all low-income households wereinjured by petroleum product overcharges, regardless of how they were heated.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Eastern Oil Company, Robert South, 9/21/88, RF306-2</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting an Application for Refundfiled by Robert South in the Eastern Oil Company refund proceeding. <T3>See Eastern Oil Co., </T3>16 DOE andpara; 85,687 (1987).
