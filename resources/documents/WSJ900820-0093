The reviewing-committee session, which begins today inGeneva, is aimed at resolving problems in the treaty, whichis widely expected to be extended beyond its expiration datein 1995.   Japan will propose that the nuclear &quot;club&quot; of nations thatpossess atomic weapons allow the International Atomic EnergyAgency to inspect all their nuclear facilities, officialssaid. Nuclear-weapons nations are now allowed to specifywhich sites will be open to inspection by the United Nationsagency, while signatories without nuclear weapons must openall sites.   Japan will also seek stronger controls on the export ofnuclear technology, including a requirement for detailedexplanations of the purpose of related equipment before thegranting of export permits. In addition, Japan will press fornonsignatory nations to join the treaty and for greaterarms-reduction efforts by members of the nuclear club.   The professed nuclear powers are China, Britain, France,India, the Soviet Union and the U.S., but several othernations are believed capable of producing nuclear arms.                                                                                                          BERLIN BIAS                                                                                                          A majority of Germans favor Berlin as the capital of aunited Germany, according to 2,093 West Germans and 799 EastGermans surveyed by the West German Interior Ministry. Thesurvey found 55% of the West Germans in favor of Berlin,compared with 43% who prefer the capital staying in Bonn.Among East Germans, 91% want Berlin and 7% like Bonn. Forcost reasons, many leading West German officials are opposedto moving the seat of government to Berlin.                                                                                                          SOUTH KOREAN ARMS BUDGET                                                                                                          South Korea's Defense Ministry called for an 18% rise inthe military budget next year, with about half the increaseto go for pay rises. However, the Economic Planning Board hasproposed a boost of less than 10%. The ministry proposal, formilitary spending equivalent to $11 billion, would representnearly 29% of the nation's total 1991 budget.                                                                                                          FOREIGN AFFAIRS TRANSLATED                                                                                                          Foreign Affairs, an influential U.S. journal of commentaryon international matters, said Chuokoron, a Japanese monthly,will translate and publish about 40 Foreign Affairs essaysand articles annually over the next five years. Chuokoronalso carries Japanese commentary on politics, economics,history and international relations. Foreign Affairs ispublished by the Council on Foreign Relations, New York.                                                                                                          SAUSAGES FOR SLIMMERS                                                                                                          Sundby-Wenbo, a Danish pork-products cooperative, said itis seeking world-wide patents for a new process that cuts thefat content of sausages and other processed meat to 3%, aboutone-fifth the level in the leanest products now available.Company officials said the process substitutes vegetableextract for fat but doesn't affect taste and consistency.They added that the lean-meat products, which the companyplans to launch in Denmark by the end of this month, containonly one-third the calories and half as much salt as otherprocessed meats.                                                                                                          TAIWAN COOLS OFF                                                                                                          Taiwan's economy is expected to grow 5.24% in 1990, downfrom 7.33% in 1989 and the lowest rate since 1983, agovernment agency reported. The estimate trailed both thegovernment's 1990 target of 7% and a prediction in May of7.23%. Officials attributed the slowing economic activitymainly to lackluster stock-market performance, rising laborcosts, decreasing exports and continuing declines in privateinvestment.                                                                                                          CLOSE SHAVE IN ISRAEL                                                                                                          Israel's chief rabbi, Mordechai Eliahu, ruled thatOrthodox Jewish men may shave their beards so gas masks fitproperly in the event of a chemical attack by Iraq, and heurged them to carry scissors in case they need a fast trim.   Many Orthodox men have full beards and wear side curls.But, in his ruling, Rabbi Eliahu said that although Jewishtradition always speaks of Jewish men wearing beards, therewas no prohibition against shaving in the body of Jewish law.   &quot;Bearded men have to shave off their beards before wearinga gas mask, because even a two-day beard prevents the maskfrom sealing properly and may allow the gas to penetrateinside,&quot; the rabbi said.   The Israeli government has considered distributing masksbecause of threats by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein toattack the Jewish state with chemical weapons. Private salesof masks have boomed.

Japan's cosmetic-surgery business, once patronized largelyby entertainers and bar hostesses, is getting a new look ofits own. Young women are flooding surgeons' offices foroperations ranging from nose jobs and double eyelids to bustenhancements. . . . Moscow, which often boasts of having theworld's best ice cream, has a shortage in these waning daysof summer. Officials said two of the Soviet capital's threeice-cream factories are closed for repairs.</TEXT></DOC>
