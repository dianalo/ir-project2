In a major speech clearly aimed at Soviet President Mikhail S.Gorbachev, the president said popular demands for democraticreforms are sweeping through the communist world, forcing are-examination of Cold War fears and security precautions.   ``The Cold War,'' he said, ``began with the division of Europe.It can only end when Europe is whole.''   Triumphant after his debut at the NATO summit in Brussels,Belgium, the president spoke in the Rhine River city of Mainzbefore an audience in the Rheingoldhalle theater. Four blocks away,about 250 demonstrators protested Bush's visit under a heavy policeguard.   The protesters waved banners and placards reading ``Bush GoHome,'' ``Bush Is Not Welcome Here'' and ``Bush _ Hands OffNicaragua.'' The main bridge spanning the Rhine River was sealedoff, and helicopters circled the hall where Bush spoke.   In the capital of Bonn, boats crammed with security agents indiving gear watched over the nearby Rhine when Bush made a farewellvisit to U.S. ambassador Vernon Walters. ``Youth are the world, andI hope what happened within NATO guarantees the future,'' thepresident told several hundred flag-waving Americans and WestGermans who massed on the ambassador's lawn.   It was his first and only major address during a week-long tripto Italy, Belgium, Germany and Britain. After today's speech and acruise down the Rhine River, Bush flew to London for talks withPrime Minster Margaret Thatcher, who greeted him at HeathrowAirport as a band played marching tunes.   Bush's NATO proposals for cutbacks in conventional East-Westtroop levels and armaments drew another positive response fromSoviet officials today. Gennady Gerasimov, spokesman for the Sovietforeign ministry, said on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' that``we ask for a timeout to study it, but the initial reaction ispositive.''   The central theme of the Mainz speech was a call for freedom anddemocracy for all of Europe.   ``The world has waited long enough,'' said Bush, who plans tovisit Poland and Hungary in July. ``The time is right. Let Europebe whole and free.   ``In the East, brave men and women are showing us the way,''Bush said.   ``Look at Poland, where Solidarity and the Catholic Church havewon legal status. The forces of freedom are putting the Sovietstatus quo on the defensive.   ``In the West, we have succeeded because we have been faithfulto our values and our vision. But, on the other side of the rustingIron Curtain, their vision failed.''   He said that nowhere is the division between East and West moreobvious than in Berlin, where Communist authorities erected a wallof concrete and barbed wire in 1961 in an effort to halt the flowof refugees to the West.   ``There, a brutal wall cuts neighbor from neighbor and brotherfrom brother,'' Bush said. ``That wall stands as a monument to thefailure of communism. It must come down.''   He issued that challenge as part of a series of proposals ``toheal Europe's tragic division, to help Europe become whole andfree.''   Bush said Berlin should become a center of commerce andcooperation instead of confrontation.   ``Bring glasnost to East Berlin,'' he declared.   Bush said the West and East should cooperate to foster freeelections in Eastern Europe, and he offered Western technicaltraining and other steps to help the East cope with environmentalproblems that threaten both sides.   Recalling the measures he proposed at the NATO summit for cutsin U.S. and Soviet combat troops in Europe, Bush reiterated hiscall for the Soviet Union and its allies to open their skies toreciprocal, unarmed aerial surveillance flights to monitor militaryactivities.   He also called for a worldwide ban on chemical weapons.   Summing up, Bush said, ``Growing political freedom in the East,a Berlin without barriers, a cleaner environment, a lessmillitarized Europe _ each is a noble goal.   ``Taken together, they are the foundation of our larger vision,a Europe that is free and at peace with itself,'' he said.   ``Let the Soviets know that our goal is not to undermine theirlegitimate security interests,'' the president said. `` Our goal isto convince them, step by step, that their definition of securityis obsolete, that their deepest fears are unfounded.''   Bush said the very concept of a divided Europe was ``under siege_ not by armies but by the spread of ideas'' that began in Mainz,the birthplace of Johannes Gutenberg, inventor of the printingpress.   Bush said the power of democracy was ``sweeping across Eurasia.This one idea is why the communist world, from Budapest to Beijing,is in ferment.''   Bush told leaders of the Eastern bloc they were ``unleashing aforce they will find difficult to channel or control: the hungerfor liberty of oppressed peoples who have tasted freedom.''   Bush arrived in Bonn on Tuesday after the two-day summit inBrussels, and conferred today with West German leaders before theRhine River cruise.   An upbeat Bush called the summit meeting ``a double hit''because it produced a united allied front on short-range nuclearweapons and favorable reaction to his proposal for cuts in U.S. andSoviet combat troop strength in Europe to 275,000 on each side.   At a post-summit news conference, Bush noted that the SovietUnion has a more than 3-1 advantage in short-range tactical nuclearmissiles over NATO forces.   ``Why don't they just unilaterally reduce to equal numbers?''Bush said. ``Now, there'd be a good challenge.''   The communique winding up the 40th anniversary NATO summitcontained a compromise specifying that only a ``partial reduction''in battlefield nuclear weapons would be pursued with the East.   That limited step was a setback for West Germany, which hadsought early U.S.-Soviet negotiations with the possible aim ofeliminating the missiles both in NATO and the Soviet-led WarsawPact.   Despite the tilt toward the U.S. position, the Germans did notleave the summit empty-handed. On a related issue, Bush and Mrs.Thatcher agreed to Bonn's demand for a delay in modernization ofthe U.S.-built Lance missile launchers, which are deployed mostlyin West Germany.   In a televised interview, Bush said he was encouraged overall byinitial Soviet reaction to NATO's stand on short-range missiles.   Bush dismised a complaint from Foreign Ministry spokesmanGennady Gerasimov in Moscow that NATO's communique linksnegotiations on nuclear weapons to reductions in conventionalforces.   ``The West will not let Mr. Gorbachev dictate the terms of anydiscussion,'' Bush said. ``I would encourage the Soviets in aspirit of good will to come forward and talk and not try to dictatesome terms through a spokesman.''</TEXT></DOC>
