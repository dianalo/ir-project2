On January 20, 1988, the Secretary of State determined thatNorth Korea is a country that has repeatedly supported acts of internationalterrorism. Accordingly, this rule amends the Export Administration Regulations(EAR) by extending anti-terrorism controls on exports to North Korea.The anti-terrorism controls are in addition to the validated license controlsfor foreign policy purposes covering the export and reexport of virtuallyall U.S.-origin commodities and technical data to North Korea.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Effective Date: The amendments affecting andSection; 385.1are effective August 1, 1988.

Because this rule concerns a foreign and military affairs function ofthe United States, it is not a rule or regulation within the meaning ofsection 1(a) of Executive Order 12291, and it is not subject to the requirementsof that Order. Accordingly, no preliminary or final Regulatory Impact Analysishas to be or will be prepared.2. This rule does not contain a collection of information requirement subjectto the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>).3. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), includingthose requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunityfor public comment, and a delay in effective date. This rule is also exemptfrom these APA requirements because it involves a foreign and militaryaffairs function of the United States. Section 13(b) of the EAA requiresthat this rule be published in interim form because this rule is removingNorth Korea from that group of countries for which General License GLRis available for replacement parts for aircraft, helicopters, or nationalsecurity controlled commodities. No other law requires that a notice ofproposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given forthis rule.4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Act (5 U.S.C. 553), or by any other law, under sections603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603(a) and604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has to be orwill be prepared.5. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order12612.Because this rule is being issued in interim form, comments will be consideredin the development of final regulations. Accordingly, the Department encouragesinterested persons who wish to comment to do so at the earliest possibletime to permit the fullest consideration of their views.The period for comments submission will close August 31, 1988. The Departmentwill consider all comments received before the close of the comment periodin developing final regulations. Comments received after the end of thecomment period will be considered if possible, but their considerationcannot be assured. The Department will not accept public comments accompaniedby a request that part or all of the material be treated confidentiallybecause of its business proprietary nature or for any other reason. TheDepartment will return such comments and materials to the person submittingthe comments and will not consider them in the development of final regulations.All public comments on these regulations will be a matter of public recordand will be available for public inspection and copying. In the interestof accuracy and completeness, the Department requires comments in writtenform. Oral comments must be followed by written memoranda, which will alsobe a matter of public record and will be available for public review andcopying. Communications from agencies of the United States Government orforeign governments will not be made available for public inspection.The public record concerning these regulations will be maintained in theBureau of Export Administration Freedom of Information Records InspectionFacility, Room 4886, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and PennsylvaniaAvenue NW., Washington, DC 20230.
