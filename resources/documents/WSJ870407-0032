Garcia</HL><DD> 04/07/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   A modest advance yesterday was sufficient to carry the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its first close above 2400.    Although the blue-chip average crossed its fifth century milestone this year and most stock prices moved higher, much of the market action was concentrated in a handful of special situations. Among the best-performing sectors were drug, paper, auto and chemical.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 15.20 to 2405.54, its second consecutive record close. Yesterday's advance followed a record one-day spurt of 69.89 points Friday.    The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.54 to 301.95, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 0.76 to 170.96.    Although the major indexes finished higher, Big Board issues showing price gains outnumbered decliners by a margin of only 8 to 7. Big Board volume of 173.7 million shares was only moderately active and far below Friday's 213.4 million shares.    The stock market opened strong, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining nearly 15 points in the first 30 minutes of trading. The industrial average maintained much of its early gains throughout most of the session. Traders said there was some light demand for U.S. stocks from foreign investors. Domestic investors were buyers as well, traders said, but not as aggressively as on Friday.    A somewhat firmer bond market and stable dollar also provided some support for the stock market.    Thom Brown, head of the investment policy committee at Butcher andamp; Singer in Philadelphia, said his common sense tells him that some of the excessive earnings multiples on some highflying drug and technology stocks are the first signs of speculation creeping into this market.    But Mr. Brown said there are a number of offsetting fundamental factors among many blue-chip companies, including robust earnings growth and strong shares of the markets in which they compete. For the time being, such factors, as well as ample cash still available to be invested in the stock market, are allaying his concerns about speculation, Mr. Brown said.    Texaco slid 4 to 33 5/8 on trading of more than 5.9 million shares, making it the most-active Big Board issue. The Supreme Court ruled that a federal court shouldn't have blocked a Texas law that required the oil concern to post a $12 billion bond while it appeals a judgment in favor of Pennzoil. Pennzoil shot up 6 7/8 to 88 1/2.    Oil analysts said the Supreme Court decision could intensify pressure on Texaco to settle its case with Pennzoil.    Standard Oil rose 5/8 to 71 1/4. First Boston, the financial adviser to Standard Oil's special committee of directors studying British Petroleum's $70-a-share bid, said that the offer was &quot;inadequate from a financial point of view&quot; and that the acquisition value should be at least $85 a share.    British Petroleum, which already owns 55% of Standard Oil, rose 1/2 to 60 1/8. The British concern said it doesn't plan to increase its bid.    UAL soared 6 3/4 to 65 3/4 in heavy trading of more than 3.4 million shares. The union representing the pilots of United Airlines offered to buy the carrier from its parent for $4.5 billion. Management, which originally branded the unexpected offer as a publicity stunt, said it would study the proposal.    Other airline issues were strong, and the gains helped lead to a 10.05-point advance in the Dow Jones Transportation Average to a record 961.48. The previous record was 958.21, set March 6.    Caesars World gained 1 3/8 to 30 5/8 on volume of more than 2.1 million shares. The company announced over the weekend a recapitalization plan that would pay shareholders a one-time cash dividend of $25 a share. The plan is aimed at fending off a $28-a-share tender offer from investor Martin Sosnoff.    Forest product issues continued to gain, with Boise Cascade up 1 1/2 to 85 3/4, Weyerhaeuser up 2 1/2 to 59, Georgia Pacific up 5/8 to 51 3/8 and Champion International up 5/8 to 42 3/4. Shares of paper product concerns were also strong.    Chemical stocks advanced, with Du Pont up 2 3/8 to 122, Allied-Signal up 1 3/8 to 48, Dow Chemical up 1 1/4 to 84 1/4 and Monsanto up 2 to 83.    Auto stocks were strong. General Motors moved up 1 3/4 to 81 1/2, Chrysler gained 1 5/8 to 58 1/4 and Ford advanced 2 5/8 to 90 1/8 on more than 1.2 million shares.    Several Wall Street analysts expect Ford to raise its quarterly dividend and approve a stock split when its board meets later this week. Scott Merlis at Morgan Stanley said that because Ford is sitting on $30 a share in cash, &quot;the odds of something good happening in a situation like this are high.&quot; He reiterated his buy recommendation on the stock last week because of the potential for a dividend rise.    Investors bought drug stocks. Squibb sprinted ahead 5 3/4 to 162 1/2, SmithKline Beckman gained 3 1/2 to 111, Upjohn rose 3 1/2 to 131 1/2, Merck moved up 3 5/8 to 165 5/8, Marion Laboratories rose 1 to 72 1/4, Eli Lilly gained 2 to 99 and Johnson andamp; Johnson gained 1 1/4 to 91 1/8.    Supermarkets General fell 1 1/2 to 43 1/8 after Dart Group withdrew its $1.7 billion offer to buy the company.    GenCorp rose 3 to 118 in active trading. The company plans to start a repurchase of 54% of common stock at $130 a share later this week. The move is in response to a possible $2.3 billion offer from a partnership led by AFG Industries and Wagner andamp; Brown.    Clevite Industries rose 2 3/4 to 11 1/4 in over-the-counter trading. The company's chairman is forming a management-backed leveraged buyout of the company at $11.50 a share.    Radiation Systems gained 3/8 to 10 3/8. Late Friday, an investor group including Kappa Networks and one of Kappa's major shareholders said it holds a 5.25% stake in the company and may seek control. </TEXT></DOC>
