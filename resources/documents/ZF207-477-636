(Cambridge, Mass.).andP;  Other popularfront-end CASE programs for Pcs include Design-Aid, $6,900, from Nastec Corp.andO;(Southfield, Mich.); Teamwork/PCSA, $995, from Cadre Technologies(Providence, R.I.); ProKit*Workbench, $9,200, from McDonnell Douglas (St.andO;Louis), and Information Engineering Workbench, $3,675 to $8,625, fromKnowledgeWare.andM;Pictures are a common languageandM;The diagrams that these and other CASE tools produce are much better thanwords at representing the inherent structure of a software program.andP;  Theymake it easier for programmers to converse with the future users of a system.andO;&quot;We used to write things out using a lot of computer terms,&quot; says ChuckGibson, director of operating systems support for Ramada Inc., in Phoenix.andO;&quot;But to users,&quot; he says, &quot;it was as if we were speaking a foreign language.&quot;andO;CASE diagrams, he says, let users easily see what the system does, cuttingdown dramatically on communication problems.andM;For Bob Hammond, a systems engineer at the Naval Facilities EngineeringCommand in Alexandria, Va., using CASE tools meant completing the second partof a major project on time, without having to increase staff.andP;  Hammond isusing KnowledgeWare's Information Engineering Worlbench to build a systemthat monitors the 30,000 to 40,000 construction contracts the Commandoversees for the Navy.andP;  &quot;Without CASE,&quot; says Hammond, &quot;I would have had toadd 10% to 15% more people.&quot;andM;Even so, the project has involved several hundred people.andP;  Before Hammondbegan using CASE, he had trouble maintaining all the data the staff hadgathered for the system.andP;  &quot;It was quite unwieldy,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;A CASE productis a must for the data-gathering process.&quot;andM;Hammond expects a bigger payoff from CASE in the years ahead.andP;  He foreseesvery few maintenance problems because the up-front design is so tight.andP;  MostCASE users claim that fewer maintenance headaches are the biggestproductivity gain.andM;To further increase productivity, some CASE programs, such as InformationEngineering Workbench, incorporate both front-end and back-end functions.andO;These are the I-CASE tools, which not only produce system diagrams but alsogenerate application code.andM;&quot;Until now, software developers have been producing CASE tools for veryspecific tasks,&quot; says Peter Levine, vice president of software engineeringstrategy with the Gartner Group, a market research firm in Stamford, Conn.andO;But in the future, CASE developers will tie different tools together.andP;  Theresult, he says, will be a full life-cycle program that can take usersthrough the software-development process from start to finish.andP;  Eventually,says Levine, CASE tools will also cross computer platforms, building systemsthat tie mainframes, minicomputers, and PCs together, and work acrossdifferent operating systems.andM;Another potentially exciting area for CASE products is in reverseengineering.andP;  Unlike designing an application from scratch, reverseengineering, in this context, means reengineering an existing application sothat it conforms to a single, structured design approach.andP;  This can eliminatemany of the embedded patches and modifications that applications tend toacquire over the years.andP;  Reverse engineering can deliver the low-maintenancebenefits of CASE by allowing programmers to make future modifications andimprovements much more quickly and easily.andM;Someday, market researcher McClure expects to see more artificialintelligence, particularly in the form of expert systems, built into CASEproducts.andP;  As the technology matures and CASE products address moresoftware-development needs, she says the rush to use them will accelerate.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
