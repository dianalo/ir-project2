The entire 44-man Cabinet stepped down, spokesman Wolfgang Meyersaid. The government will remain in office until Parliament electsa new council of ministers. He did not say when that would be.   The Cabinet, led by Premier Willi Stoph, has little real powerof its own but implements policy of the Communist Party's rulingPoliburo, which also was under pressure to step down.   The Politburo met today to discuss ways of stopping the exodusof East Germans to the West. The governing Central Committee was tomeet Wednesday to consider further changes aimed at stopping theexodus.   About 5,000 people marched in East Berlin to protest electionfraud and call for free elections, and leaflets passed out calledfor more protests.   A parliamentary committee rejected a proposed travel law thatwould have allowed East Germans to travel in the West for 30 days ayear, saying it did not go far enough.   The East Berlin newspaper Junge Welt, organ of the country'sCommunist Youth organization, said today leaders ``should resignwithout any delay'' to make way for a new Politburo and a newCabinet that will implement reforms.   Dresden's Communist Mayor Wolfgang Berghofer also urged theresignations, as did a member of Leipzig's Communist citygovernment, Bernhard Knupp, and three small parties that have beenallied with the Communists.   The Politburo normally has 21 members, but two lost their jobsOct. 18 and the new Communist Party leader, Egon Krenz, has saidfive others will be replaced this week.   Communist Party sources said today they expect the reform-mindedDresden party chief, Hans Modrow, to be elected to the Politburo.Modrow has been mentioned as a possible new premier, replacingStoph.   Despite Krenz's promises of change, East Germans continued topour into West Germany and were arriving today at a rate of about120 an hour.   West German federal border police said 28,000 refugees hadarrived by late this morning in the latest surge, which began earlySaturday when East Germany's Communist leaders began allowing freeexit via Czechoslovakia.   Police spokesman Karl Heinz Horndasch said the East Germans werebeing taken to 56 temporary shelters nationwide.   About 500,000 people demonstrated in Leipzig on Monday night inwhat has become a weekly ritual, and more than 200,000 others tookpart in street protests in at least six other cities.   The marchers demanded free elections and the legalization ofopposition groups, challenging the Communist Party's politicalmonopoly.   They also ridiculed a draft of the proposed travel law.   Parliament's constitutional committee today said the law ``doesnot meet the expectations of citizens ... and will not achieve thepolitical credibility of the state,'' the official ADN news agencysaid.   The committee called for another law that, among other things,would lift the need for exist visas. It also called for anemergency Parliament session to discuss the tense situation in thecountry.   So far this year, more than 175,000 East Germans _ more than 1percent of the population of 16.6 million _ have moved to WestGermany by emigrating legally, escaping or failing to return fromapproved trips abroad. West Germany gives them automaticcitizenship and help in starting new lives.   The unexpected decision to let East Germans out throughCzechoslovakia created the first free route to the West since theBerlin Wall went up in 1961. In Leipzig on Monday, protestersshouting ``The Wall must go!'' braved driving rain. Bannersdemanded ``Free Elections'' and ``Travel Law without Restrictions.''   Michael Turek, a Lutheran Church pastor in the southernindustrial city of 650,000, said by telephone that about 500,000people marched. ADN said members of New Forum, the largestpro-reform group, addressed the crowd.   A mammoth rally Saturday in East Berlin, where the crowd wasestimated at 1 million, was the largest protest in the country's40-year history.   ADN said 70,000 people marched in Dresden on Monday, 60,000 inHalle, 50,000 in Karl-Marx-Stadt, 25,000 in Schwerin, and severalthousand each in a several other towns.   In Dresden, the march was authorized by authorities and led bythe reform-minded party chief, Modrow, and Mayor WolfgangBerghofer. ADN said it was the first sanctioned demonstration inthe city.</TEXT></DOC>
