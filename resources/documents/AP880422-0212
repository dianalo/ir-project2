Botha condemnedneo-Nazis who placed pigs' heads at the front doors of a synagogueand a Jewish club on the 99th anniversary of Adolf Hitler's birth.   ``South Africa will have to rid itself of these people if wewant to get somewhere,'' Botha said Friday in Parliament. SouthAfrica has about 100,000 Jews in a total white population of 5million.   Josh Goldberg, director of the Council of Jewry in Natalprovince, quoted witnesses as saying six white men wearing bootsand black Nazi-style uniforms with swastika-like arm bands drove upto a synagogue in Durban late Wednesday and placed a pig's head atthe entrance. The head was covered with swastikas.   Durban police said they were seeking the culpirts.   A celebration of Israel's 40th anniversary was held at theJewish club Wednesday evening, Goldberg said, and a pig's head wasleft there soon after it ended.   ``I think it is only sick people who can take a pig's head andplace it in front of the holy shrine of others,'' Botha said,promising an investigation.   Government officials and legislators joined the condemnation.   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok considered the incidentssickening, a spokesman said. Colin Eglin, leader of the whiteopposition Progressive Federal Party, said they were ``a deliberateaffront to members of the Jewish community.''   Wynand Malan, an independent member of Parliament, urged policeto arrest those responsible for the Durban incidents and thethrowing of a smoke grenade into a mosque Wednesday night nearJohannesburg. He said South Africa's future is ``in the richdiversity in our society.''   A member of the Moslem congregation at Heidelberg, an industrialcommunity, said two worshipers were injured when a man in uniformthrew the grenade during an observance of the holy month of Ramadan.   The independent South African Press Association said members ofthe Afrikaner National Socialists celebrated Hitler's birthdayWednesday in Pretoria, the capital.   It quoted Koos Vermeulen, the group's leader, as saying:``People tend to get upset when people who believed in Hitler'sgreatness honor him. So we conduct our celebrations in secret.''   Although South Africa joined the Allies during both world wars,there was sympathy for the German and Nazi causes among theAfrikaners who are South Africa's dominant white community.   In 1939-41, Botha belonged to the pro-German Ossewabrandwag, aparamilitary group. He resigned in 1941 and repudiated theleadership.   South Africa has 26 million blacks, who have no vote in nationalaffairs under the apartheid system.</TEXT></DOC>
