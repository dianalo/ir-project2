Kuwait's crown prince and prime minister, Sheik Saad al-Abdullahal-Sabah, meanwhile called on ``sister and friendly states'' toarrest, try and punish the hijackers and asked for inter-Arabcooperation to fight terrorism.   He said he did not know if the hijackers were still in Algeria,where the ordeal ended on its 16th day last Wednesday.   Kuwait's move came amid growing fears in Arab states that the7{-year-war between Iran and Iraq will increase terrorism bypro-Iranian Shiite Moslem groups. Saudi Arabia intends to form itsown anti-terrorist squad, it was reported last month.   The Saudis are to receive help from Gen. Ulrich Wegener,commander of West Germany's crack anti-terrorist force. He headedthe commandos that stormed a hijacked Lufthansa jetliner inMogadishu, Somalia, in 1977, considered a classic anti-hijackingoperation.   Many West European countries, including Britain, France, Italyand West Germany, have elite units which have acted againstterrorists over the last 20 years.   The new Kuwaiti force will be directed by the Interior Ministryafter a six-month training program by foreign experts in Kuwait andabroad, said the security officials, speaking on condition ofanonymity.   They gave no details and did not identify the foreignspecialists.   Pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems hijacked the Kuwaiti Boeing 747 with112 people aboard April 5 as it was flying from Bangkok, Thailand,to Kuwait. The hijackers killed two Kuwaiti passengers before theordeal ended in Algiers on Wednesday.   The hijackers demanded that Kuwait release 17 terroristsconvicted for bombing the U.S. and French embassies in Kuwait in1983. Kuwaiti officials said they would not release them.   The hijacking ended when the gunmen slipped off the jet,apparently after receiving a promise of safe passage to anundisclosed country. The passengers left the plane shortlyafterward.   Rashed Abdel-Aziz Rashed, minister of state for Cabinet affairs,told Saudi Arabia's al-Sharq al-Awsat newspaper that Kuwait had notbeen told of the hijackers' whereabouts.   However, the right-wing daily newspaper al-Seyassa and theradical al-Rai al-Aam daily reported Monday that Kuwaiti securityauthorities, aided by unidentified foreign intelligence agencies,have identified the hijackers. It did not elaborate.   Rashed told al-Seyassa that ``certain powers and parties hostileto the Arabs were behind the hijacking.'' It was an apparentreference to Iran and the pro-Iranian, Lebanon-based Hezbollah, orParty of God.   Iran is Persian, not Arab. Although it shares the Moslemreligion with the Arabs, it adheres to the minority Shiite sectthat has been at odds with the predominant Sunni branch of Islamfor 1,300 years.   The Shiite fundamentalist Hezbollah is believed to be theumbrella group for Shiite factions holding most of the 21 foreignhostages in Lebanon.   The longest held is Terry Anderson, 40, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,1985.   The Kuwaiti Cabinet set up a committee to investigate thehijacking, Rashed announced Sunday, saying ``murdering the twoKuwaiti passengers is a crime that will not go unpunished.''   Prime Minister Saad told editors of local and weekly newspapersin a televised news conference Monday that tiny, oil-rich Kuwait``alone cannot put an end to or contain the activity of terrorists.I hereby issue a frank and sincere call to our Arab brethren tocooperate to fight terrorism and terrorists wherever they exist.''   ``The apprehension, trial and punishment of the (Kuwait Airways)hijackers should take place through constructive dialogue betweenus and sister and friendly states,'' Saad said.   He also said that when the jet landed at Mashhad airport in Iranearly in its Odyssey, Iranian officials pressed the Kuwaiti teamwhich flew to Mashhad ``to accept all or part of the hijackers'demands, but the Kuwaiti reply was a clear and frank rejection.''</TEXT></DOC>
