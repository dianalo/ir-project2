(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Pamela PfiffnerandM;Mac enthusiast David Biedny remembers the moment he first knew the Mac wasgoing to change the way people related to the printed page.andM;&quot;In late 1984 Apple sent out a memo to dealers, and at the bottom of theletter Steve Jobs wrote, 'This was printed on an insanely great peripheral weare about to announce,' &quot; said Biedny, who went on to become a desktoppublishing specialist at MacUser magazine from 1985-86.andM;The peripheral was the Apple LaserWriter with Adobe Systems Inc.'s PostScriptpage description language running on the spiffy new Mac 512K.andP;  After itsintroduction in January 1985, publishing was never the same.andM;James Cavuoto, editor and publisher of MicroPublishing Report of Torrance,Calif., a monthly newsletter dedicated to personal computer-based publishing,was an editor at Lasers and Applications magazine in 1984.andP;  &quot;I was used tocovering these $100,000 printers, and somebody told me that Canon was workingon this product using diode lasers that would go to OEMs for under $1,000,&quot;Cavuoto recalled.andP;  &quot;I said, 'I've got to get this.andP;  I could start my ownpublishing company.' &quot;andM;Cavuoto hooked an IBM PC to his first LaserWriter, then priced to end usersat $6,999, and wrote a PostScript program.andP;  &quot;I got it to print a column ofjustified text,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;It was really exciting.&quot; Shortly thereafter,Cavuoto bought a Mac and began producing MicroPublishing Report with betaversions of a new piece of software called Aldus PageMaker.andM;The LaserWriter's 300-dpi Canon print engine freed users from the crudenessof dot-matrix output and the text-only constraints of daisywheel printers.andO;But the combination of the PostScript page description language in theLaserWriter's ROM and the Apple LaserWriter printer driver in the Macintoshmade complex, typed-in commands unnecessary.andP;  Whatever users drew on thescreen -- text or graphics -- would be translated to the printed page.andM;Page-layout software: The first wave.andP;  While Apple was nailing down thehardware end of desktop publishing, software companies were jostling forposition.andM;Three page-layout programs were touted at the first Macworld Expo in January1985.andP;  Aldus Corp. announced PageMaker while Manhattan Graphics Inc.andO;introduced ReadySetGo.andP;  Down on the floor of San Francisco's CivicAuditorium, Boston Software Publishing hawked MacPublisher, whose overlyenthusiastic use of the Macintosh's graphic interface may have led to itsearly demise.andP;  (MacPublisher was purchased by Letraset in 1986 forincorporation into a program called LetraPage, which never shipped.andP;  Letrasetalso acquired marketing rights to the then-renamed Ready,Set,Go! in 1987.)andM;Although Ready,Set,Go! reached customers first, PageMaker, which shipped inJuly 1985, became synonymous with desktop publishing, a term coined by Aldusfounder Paul Brainerd in 1984 (see interview, Page 26).andM;Although Ken Abbott, president of Manhattan Graphics until 1988, said thatPageMaker won widespread acceptance because &quot;then it was a better-engineeredproduct&quot; that had Apple's endorsement, many designers said it succeededbecause of its pasteboard metaphor.andP;  (Ready,Set,Go! employed a boxed-gridapproach instead.)andM;While many designers were leery of this new technology, most recognized thatPage-Maker fostered experimentation.andP;  &quot;Page-Maker was close to the normalprocess of what someone would do to put together a publication, like puttingthings on a drafting table,&quot; said Eda Warren, a Chicago-based graphicdesigner who is now an authorized Aldus trainer.andM;PageMaker's visual approach contributed to its market dominance.andP;  &quot;When youmove the block of type in PageMaker, you see the type move, not just ablock,&quot; said Biedny, who now works with multimedia in New York.andP;  &quot;No one elsewas doing that.andP;  Talk about WYSIWYG -- that's what it was all about.&quot;andM;Linotype resolves output question.andP;  While the LaserWriter was a significantimprovement over dot-matrix printers, designers accustomed to typeset outputcould not reconcile themselves to the LaserWriter's lower resolution.andP;  It mayhave been OK for in-house newsletters, but it was unacceptable forprofessional purposes, they believed.andP;  Linotype Co.'s decision in September1985 to support the PostScript page description language on its 1,270-dpiimagesetter, the Linotronic 100, was a major breakthrough.andP;  Several monthslater, the company came out with the 2,540-dpi Linotronic 300.andM;High-resolution imagesetters showcased PostScript's resolution and deviceindependence, which allowed users to print the same page on several devices.andO;Pages could be printed on a LaserWriter without losing formatting orplacement and proofread before being output on the Linotronic.andM;Christine Thompson, Apple desktop publishing marketing manager, acknowledgedthat the imagesetter brought a seriousness to desktop publishing.andO;&quot;Linotype's support took desktop publishing from the realm of near-typesetquality to typeset quality,&quot; she said.andM;Design professionals were not the only ones to benefit from the Mac's link tohigh-resolution -- and high-cost -- imagesetters.andP;  Service bureaus sprang upovernight.andP;  Users looking for more-refined output could go to a shop andprint on Linotype or Varityper output devices costing tens of thousands ofdollars.andP;  As a result, general users became more design savvy and productliterate, which had interesting repercussions.andM;&quot;When Apple started implying that you don't need to know design and you don'tneed a printer, that's when professionals got insulted and became a lot moreserious about desktop publishing,&quot; said Lori Small, vice president of Designandamp; Type, a San Francisco service bureau that was founded in December 1985.andM;What's your type?andP;  With improved output, the typographic limitations of theMacintosh were glaringly obvious.andP;  At traditional type houses, designersluxuriated in vast font libraries and special typographic effects.andP;  WhenAdobe released its first set of Macintosh fonts in March 1986, Mac designerssaw the beginning of the long road to reaching parity with their traditionalcounterparts.andM;The demand for increased typographic control led to the creation ofQuarkXPress.andP;  Released in March 1987, Quark Inc.'s page-layout program hasmore typographic flexibility and precision than PageMaker.andP;  Tim Gill, whofounded Quark in 1981 to develop word processing software, said thatQuarkXPress grew out of the need he perceived for more-refined tools.andM;&quot;We saw that there was a high-end part of desktop publishing that needed tobe addressed,&quot; said Gill, now senior vice president in charge of Randamp;D atQuark.andP;  &quot;The products that were out there weren't sophisticated enough toserve that market.&quot;andM;The development of QuarkXPress was furthered by the implementation offractional width spacing and by the provision for kerning pairs in Apple'snewly defined FOND resource in 1986, Gill said.andM;That same year, Altsys Corp. introduced Fontographer, a program for creatingor modifying PostScript type.andP;  Fontographer helped to raise the awareness ofthe term &quot;Bezier curve&quot; among Mac-based designers, presaging thefull-featured PostScript drawing programs to come.andM;Graphics and industry file formats.andP;  Drawing programs that createdobject-oriented graphics provided designers with important desktop tools.andO;MacDraw, developed by Apple and now marketed by Claris Corp., broughtobject-oriented graphics to users in 1984.andM;On the next level was Adobe Illustrator, released in March 1987, followed inFebruary 1988 by Aldus FreeHand (developed by Altsys).andP;  Both were designedspecifically to take advantage of PostScript.andM;&quot;Illustrator did for artists what PageMaker did for layout people,&quot;MicroPublishing Report's Cavuoto said.andP;  Files created in Illustrator andFreeHand could be saved in Encapsulated PostScript format, a universal fileformat introduced in April 1986 that allowed placement ofPostScript-generated art in most page-layout programs.andM;While object-oriented graphics software freed designers from the dreaded&quot;jaggies&quot; inherent in bit-mapped paint programs, input devices like scannershelped translate rough pencil sketches into polished computer art.andP;  Earlyscanners read only black-and-white information, but the eight-bit scannersthat followed recognized up to 256 levels of gray, bringing photographicimages under desktop control.andM;TIFF, released initially in 1986 and championed by Aldus, was quicklyaccepted as the industry standard format for scanned images.andM;&quot;Before the invention of TIFF, every vendor in the world had a different fileformat,&quot; Gill said.andP;  &quot;TIFF made it possible for users to share file formats.&quot;andM;Letraset's ground-breaking ImageStudio, released in November 1987, let usersedit or retouch photo-realistic images.andP;  Silicon Beach Software Inc.'sDigital Darkroom, released in August 1988, took gray-scale image editing tonew heights.andP;  But the new frontier of color beckoned.andM;Somewhere over the rainbow.andP;  When the Mac went color in 1987, designershungered for software and hardware that would let them realize the colorcapabilities of the new computers.andP;  Equipped with new video boards andlarge-screen color monitors, Macs went from eight-bit color, or 256 colors,to 24 and 32 bits, a spectrum of 16.8 million colors.andP;  New color paint andimage editing software appeared, such as Electronic Arts' Studio/8 foreight-bit images and SuperMac Technology Inc.'s PixelPaint Professional for32-bit images, among others.andM;In 1988, key graphics software such as Adobe Illustrator 88 and AldusFreeHand 2.0 incorporated the Pantone Matching System, a print industrycolor-definition standard.andP;  Page-layout software began to address colorpre-press operations as well.andP;  QuarkXPress has hooks for importing andseparating color images.andP;  PageMaker with Color Extension and Letraset's newDesignStudio can display and edit color image files, but both requireadditional separation utilities.andP;  Meanwhile, Adobe's 24-bit color imageprocessing package, Photoshop, has incorporated impressive color separationcapabilities.andM;But color input and output devices are still in their infancy compared withthe high-end color systems used in traditional pre-press houses.andP;  Whileproblems exist in producing color separations directly from the Macintosh,QuarkXPress, PageMaker and Ready,Set,Go! have links to such high-end systemsas those from Scitex America Corp., Crosfield Electronics Ltd. and HellGraphic Systems Inc.andP;  Aldus has also created the Open Prepress Interface(OPI), a standard that lets pre-press vendors generate four-color separationsof Mac-produced documents containing color TIFF images.andM;Chief among the problems facing Macintosh desktop publishers making thetransition to color pre-press technology is the difference between themonitor screen and printed page.andP;  &quot;I have to remind people that as long asit's on the screen, it's only TV color,&quot; said Marjorie Spiegelman, a SanFrancisco designer who created the original look of Macworld and Publish!andO;magazines.andM;Monitor calibration systems and Pantone color might alleviate color problems,but many designers say that when it comes to color separation, whizzysoftware cannot replace human expertise.andM;Who needs kerning in 0.001-em increments?andP;  In the five years since itsintroduction, desktop publishing technology has clearly changed, and so hasthe market it addresses.andM;&quot;The DTP market is bifurcating,&quot; admitted Apple's Thompson.andP;  On one end areless demanding users like corporate information officers, small-businessowners, and church and school publication directors; on the other end arepublishing and design professionals.andM;New developments in desktop publishing are primarily geared toward designprofessionals.andP;  As a result, however, users with simpler needs are oftenbewildered by the choices and high prices of the more sophisticated programs.andO;The &quot;big three&quot; page-layout programs have gravitated toward the professionalmarket; a new generation of low-end page-layout products, such as SiliconBeach's Personal Press, Springboard Software Inc.'s Springboard Publisher andTimeworks Inc.'s Publish-It!, are stepping in to fill the void.andM;&quot;I'm afraid the low-end market is getting ignored,&quot; Spiegelman said.andP;  &quot;Themain problem is education.&quot; Spiegelman, along with other designers, said shebelieves that anyone who uses desktop publishing needs to learn basic designskills in addition to mastering the Macintosh.andM;But, in spite of sometimes scathing aesthetic critiques by designprofessionals of the efforts by amateurs to use these new tools, wide-eyedenthusiasm for desktop publishing is prevalent among both pros and neophytes.andO;Desktop publishing continues to provide increasingly powerful capabilitiesfor professionals and is still raising the level of design sophistication ofmore-casual users.andM;Far from being obsolete, Apple's original concept of desktop publishing stillholds true at both the high and low end, Thompson said.andP;  &quot;The individual cancontrol the form and content of his messages.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
