They had been executed for trying to shield inmates fromtorture and the ovens.&quot;;    He said several people had written him to describehow SS men had saved their lives.;    Sultanik, himself a death camp survivor,wrote back that he had not found any reference to executions of SS troops inany Holocaust literature or archives. A 1986 World Jewish Congress study of SSand Nazi police records uncovered no cases of an SS member executed or sent toa concentration camp for refusing an order to kill Jews.;    Responding toSultanik, Reagan wrote, &quot;I'm sorry there is no documented evidence regardingthe SS troopers buried in prisoners' uniforms that I know of.&quot;;    Reagansaid, however, that &quot;German officials having to do with my visit were thesource of this information. . . . They even gave me the names of the few SSmen who had been so treated.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910420  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  362  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday April 20, 199100111078,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
