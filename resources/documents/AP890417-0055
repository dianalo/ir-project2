Britishofficials say they won't negotiate because it will only lead to thetaking of other hostages. I say you can negotiate without givingin.''   The French and West German governments managed to secure therelease of their hostages without being brought to their knees,Kauffmann said at the meeting organized by British and Frenchjournalists.   Kauffmann, a magazine writer and French citizen, was freed inMay 1988 after more than three years' captivity.   France, which was under constant pressure to get back itshostages, has denied paying ransom. It complied with severalIranian demands, including banishing the main Iranian oppositiongroup from Paris.   Kauffmann said he recently helped mark the start of the fifthanniversary in captivity of Terry Anderson, 42, the chief MiddleEast correspondent for The Associated Press and the longest held of15 Western hostages in Lebanon.   ``There's something cruel in these anniversaries,'' he said.   Today's meeting at UNESCO headquarters was organized by Britishand French journalists. Those at the meeting issued an appeal toall with influence ``to do whatever they can immediately to helpsecure their release.''   Organizer Anthony Brock, a British writer, said the appeal wouldbe sent to U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar and theIranian and Syrian embassies in Paris.   Iran influences Moslem extremists holding the hostages, whileSyria is the main foreign power broker in Lebanon.   A group working for McCarthy's release ran cinema, televisionand newspaper advertisements today.   One asked movie goers in Britain to close their eyes and thinkof England because McCarthy has ``done nothing else for the lastthree years.''   In a message with Arabic voice-over on Lebanese television, thehostage's mother, Sheila, said:   ``Three years of fear, grief and loneliness is a long time.Three years is a long time in a young man's life.''   His father, Pat, told his son, ``Whatever you do, old chap, keepyour spirits up.''   They published similar messages in the Beirut daily As-Safir.Another message in the newspaper, signed ``Jill'' and apparentlyfrom McCarthy's girlfriend, Jill Morell, said: ``I wish more thananything that you could be back home with us. But until then, I'msending you all my special love.''</TEXT></DOC>
