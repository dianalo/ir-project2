We show that the level populations inthe ICP source approximate a thermal distribution and use this propertyto interpolate betwen levels of known lifetime to find the populationof levels of unknown lifetime. Comparison of the spectra from the twodifferent sources distinguishes between Mo I and II lines and detectshidden blends and self-absorption in the hollow cathode source. Improvedexcitation energy for many Mo I levels was extracted from the high resolutionFourier transform spectrum, and 27 new levels were found.</TEXT></DOC>
