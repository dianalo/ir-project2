These calculations are used to determine the effect that an assumedtime scale for the thermal quench phase of the disruption has on thecalculated plasma current decay rate, the partitioning of the plasmathermal energy, the predicted surface erosion of plasma interface components,and the predicted induced forces in structural components. Since theseverity of the disruptive event can be compounded by a vertical instability,the calculations have also been used to consider the case of a disruptingplasma that simultaneously undergoes a vertical instability. 4 refs.,6 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
