In a letter dated Feb. 7, Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, newchairman of the Senate Appropriations defense subcommittee, invited17 colleagues to join him on a trip to Germany, Italy, Turkey,Egypt, Israel and Spain.   ``Far from being a `congressional junket,' this trip will take usto areas which I believe we need to visit to understand thedimensions of the problems confronting U.S. national security and tomeet the responsibilities we face as members of the subcommittee ondefense,'' Inouye wrote. The Associated Press obtained a copy of theletter.   The trip is scheduled during the Senate's Easter vacation in thelast two weeks of March.   ``I also intend to make a special effort to allow time for visitsto museums, art galleries, and religious and historical sites in thecapitals and the countryside of these countries,'' Inouye wrote.   Such broad tours are crucial to understanding the ``sharedvalues'' which link the United States to its friends and allies, thesenator said.   The itinerary calls for three nights in Munich, three in Rome,two in Istanbul, three in Cairo, three in Jerusalem and one inMadrid.   The route was designed to allow members to see ```fracturezones'' of the geopolitical world, said Inouye, whose subcommitteeoversees spending for the Defense Department and the CIA.   Along the way, the senators would share Easter services withAmerican forces aboard a ship in the Persian Gulf and reviewfundamental changes under way in the Middle East peace process.   Inouye urged the senators to bring along their wives because of``certain responsibilities in the areas of protocol and diplomacy''associated with meetings with heads of state and high-levelofficials abroad.   Congressional spouses travel free with their mates on militaryaircraft, but they must pay their own expenses. The government picksup all expenses for members of Congress. They receive daily per diemat the same rate as U.S. diplomats abroad. For example, the dailyrate is $163 in Munich and $98 in Cairo.   The congressional party will fly on an Air Force jet ``to ensurethat we accomplish the objectives of our trip and to add a measureof security,'' Inouye said.   So far, only Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., has accepted Inouye'sinvitation, according to an informal head count. ``He's new on thecommittee and he wants to see all the installations,'' said hisspokesman, Steven Schlein.   Sens. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.; Bennett Johnston, D-La.; and JakeGarn, R-Utah, are undecided about whether to go.   At least 13 subcommittee members said they have no plans to go,most of them citing prior commitments and more pressing business athome.   But Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., isn't going in part because hedoesn't like being in a ``large delegation. ... He tends to prefertrips that are more focused,'' said his spokesman, Paul Jacobson.   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said he didn't have problems with thetrip, but wasn't planning to go because ``I took those trips when Iwas the chairman'' of the subcommittee. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,declined because he recently returned from the Middle East, an aidesaid.   A State Department official familiar with the trip, speaking oncondition of anonymity, said arrangements, such as the exact dates,are not yet firm.   In the Senate, foreign trips on behalf of a committee must beapproved full committee chairman, while those on behalf of the fullSenate must have the approval of the chamber's majority and minorityleaders.   Inouye has yet to formally request the approval of Sen. RobertByrd, D-W.Va., chairman of the appropriations committee, accordingto Marsha Berry, the committee spokeswoman.   Byrd, also a member of the defense panel, will not accompanyInouye. ``He plans to travel to West Virginia; that's the onlytraveling he'll do in March,'' said Tina Evans, a spokeswoman.   These senators have other plans for the recess, according to themembers or their aides: Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C.; Jim Sasser,D-Tenn.; Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; Dale Bumpers, D-Ark.; TomHarkin, D-Iowa; James McClure, R-Idaho; Bob Kasten, R-Wis.; AlfonseD'Amato, R-N.Y., and Thad Cochran, R-Miss.</TEXT></DOC>
