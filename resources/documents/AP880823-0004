Wang Zhilong, who was looking for civilian work after 20 yearsin the army, jumped to his death on July 27 from the fifth floor ofa hospital in central China's Luoyang City, the China Daily said.   Wang had been hospitalized after trying to kill himself threedays earlier by touching electric wires.   The report said Wang became depressed after a local CommunistParty official, Li Shiyi, demanded a color TV, a bicycle andname-brand cigarettes and liquor as preconditions for arranging ajob.   It said Wang spent his life savings of $810, more than double aworker's annual salary, on the gifts, but was still unable tosatisfy the corrupt official.   It said Wang's suicide surprised local party and governmentofficials and a joint team was formed to investigate the death andpunish those responsible.   The ruling Communist Party in recent months has issued sternwarnings about official corruption, which has become increasinglyserious as the nation's market-oriented economic reforms loosenstate controls.   Influence-peddling, always a part of doing business in China,has been joined by widespread black marketeering, hoarding,extortion and graft.   The daily said that in Henan province, where Luoyang is located,prosecutors handled 589 corruption cases involving 246 governmentemployees in the first six months of this year.</TEXT></DOC>
