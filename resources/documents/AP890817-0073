A California judge rejected a similar argument bydozens of activists.   Also Wednesday, a Supreme Court justice in Massachusetts liftedwithout explanation an injunction barring anti-abortion protestersfrom blocking clinics across the state.   In Clayton, Mo., Associate Circuit Judge George R. Gerhard ruledthat 11 protesters' violations of trespassing laws were ``necessaryas emergency measures to avoid the ... death and maiming of unbornchildren.''   Lawyers said the acquittals marked the first time a Missourijudge has accepted a ``necessity defense'' for trespassing byanti-abortion protesters. The sit-ins occurred in 1986 at anabortion clinic.   Gerhard cited the preamble to Missouri's abortion law that lifebegins at conception, a provision left intact by the U.S. SupremeCourt in July.   Ann L. O'Brien, a defendant and anti-abortion leader, hailed theruling. Laura Cohen, state coordinator for the National AbortionRights Action League, called the decision a ``totalmisunderstanding'' of the Supreme Court ruling.   St. Louis County prosecutor Thomas Wehrle said other judges couldrule differently. Wehrle said his office will continue to enforcethe trespassing ordinance.   In San Diego, Municipal Judge John M. Thompson ruled that dozensof anti-abortion activists can't claim they were trying to protestkilling.   ``Abortion is not killing in California,'' he said. ``Their goodmotive is irrelevant as a defense.''   The city code excludes peaceful picketing and political activityfrom its definition of trespassing.   In Boston, Supreme Judicial Court Justice Joseph Nolan onWednesday lifted a July 24 lower-court injunction barringdemonstrators from blocking abortion clinics.   The injunction had been obtained by plaintiffs in a suit allegingthe protesters violated the rights of clinic employees and clients.   Anti-abortion activist Bill Cotter praised the ruling but saidits practical effect was minimal. ``We have been blockading allalong, and we will continue to do it with or without injunctions,''he said.   Susan Newson, a spokeswoman for the Planned Parenthood League ofMassachusetts, called the judge's action ``appalling and lawless.''A Planned Parenthood lawyer said it will encourage blockading ofclinics.</TEXT></DOC>
