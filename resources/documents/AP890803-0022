KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Israel's supporters in the Senate are urgingcolleagues to exercise caution in criticizing the Jewish state forabducting a Moslem cleric linked with Lebanese terrorists.   But Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas says Israel mustunderstand that vital U.S. interests, including the lives ofAmerican hostages, may be at stake when it takes such unilateralactions as the abduction last week of Shiek Abdul Karim Obeid, aMoslem religious leader.   The Lebanese captors of Marine Lt. Col. William Higginsannounced this week they had hanged him to avenge Obeid'sabduction. Higgins' murder has not been independently confirmed,and there had been reports that he had been killed months ago.   Dole said earlier this week that Israel had not told Washingtonof its intent to kidnap Obeid and said that such ``free-lancing''might place Americans at risk.   ``I don't think my remarks have driven any wedge between theUnited States and Israel,'' Dole said Wednesday.   ``My basic message to Israel is this: `We are in this together.We both have vital interests at stake. Whenever possible we oughtto act together. And always we ought to take into account the vitalinterests of the other when we contemplate unilateral action.'   ``That is the way to avoid any wedge being driven between us,''he said.   But other senators said Israel was justified in its actions andimplied Dole may have caused harm by his remarks.   ``We ought to be very cautious about our criticism of whatIsrael has done,'' said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of theSenate Armed Services Committee.   ``Certainly all of us have questions, certainly we want to beable to have a dialogue with Israel and find out some of the thingsthat they may have known and may still know and we don't know,''Nunn said.   ``If there had been a complete release of the prisoners we wouldnow be saying this was a marvelous, marvelous action. I think weshould be very cautious in rushing to judgment in terms of what theIsraelis have done.''   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said Israel's situation, ``surroundedconstantly _ 360 degrees _ by terrorist groups'' _ should be takeninto consideration.   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said Israel's exercise of ``long-armjurisdiction'' against an alleged terrorist suspected of violatingIsraeli law was justified and is similar to actions againstterrorists taken by the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
