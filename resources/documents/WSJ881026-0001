Michael Dukakis, struggling for a late hearing in the presidential race, steadfastly told a late-night national television audience that he wouldn't adjust his campaign message in the face of polls showing him stalled behind Vice President George Bush.    &quot;I'm going to continue to address concerns of average Americans at a time when they're beginning to focus in on this campaign,&quot; he said after ABC's &quot;Nightline&quot; host Ted Koppel repeatedly asked him why he wasn't changing tactics in the final weeks in an effort to revitalize his campaign.    Mr. Dukakis said his Republican rival was &quot;trying to misuse&quot; the &quot;liberal&quot; label &quot;in a way to suggest I don't have a set of values, {that I'm} kind of permissive. That's a bad misuse of it . . . I think it's something that doesn't describe Mike Dukakis.&quot;    The Massachusetts governor called the Bush campaign and its TV advertisements &quot;one of the most cynical and hypocritical things I've ever seen&quot; and acknowledged again that &quot;perhaps I responded too late&quot; to the Bush assault.    Last night's appearance on &quot;Nightline&quot; was the latest development in a new media offensive Mr. Dukakis hopes will permit him to exploit public dissatisfaction with the campaign.    Mr. Dukakis used the 90-minute segment to outline his priorities, including an aggressive war against drugs and an effort to reduce crime. And he called for &quot;direct negotiations between Israel and her neighbors&quot; to address the Middle East crisis. He charged that &quot;very little progress&quot; had been made in the region during the Reagan administration and vowed to appoint a special envoy to the Middle East. He suggested that the U.S. should cut off most economic aid to South Africa.    In his appearance last night, Mr. Dukakis repeated many of his principal campaign themes, including his criticism of using Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega &quot;as part of our foreign policy&quot; and his refusal &quot;under any circumstances&quot; to make concessions to terrorists to win the release of hostages.    He said he might break diplomatic relations with nations such as Syria if it could be proven they were involved in terrorist activities, but added, &quot;you don't telegraph your punches in advance.&quot; He said he wouldn't resume relations with Iran.    The governor wouldn't say whether he would veto the new congressional drug bill, which permits the death penalty for those convicted of drug-related killings. Mr. Dukakis opposes the death penalty.    The governor also played down the role of the Reagan administration's negotiating strategy with the Soviet Union in the warming of relations between the two superpowers. &quot;The domestic difficulties the Soviet Union is having -- the collapse of their economy -- has a great deal to do with the fact we've had some apparent changes in Soviet attitudes about arms control and arms reduction,&quot; he said.    With the election battle in its final two weeks, the Massachusetts governor has accepted virtually every major television-interview invitation, a tactic with two goals: giving his flagging campaign a free boost and highlighting Vice President George Bush's refusal to open himself up to questioning.    &quot;Bush has nothing to say,&quot; Dayton Duncan, the Dukakis press secretary charges, adding, in a reference to the Republican candidate's media adviser: &quot;He can't say anything except what Roger Ailes tells him to say in 15-second sound bites.&quot;    This new media offensive will place Mr. Dukakis or family members in TV forums ranging from the principal network news broadcasts to the &quot;Phil Donahue Show&quot;.    The Dukakis campaign also is planning five-minute nationally televised advertisements for Sunday, next Tuesday and the Saturday before the election, and has reserved a half-hour of time on election eve on the three major networks.    This new stress on television appearances comes as Mr. Dukakis has gradually turned his emphasis from his own proposals to Mr. Bush's campaign tactics, deploring his rival's ads and arguments at nearly every stop.    Speaking before an enthusiastic outdoor audience at Diablo Valley College in California's Contra Costa County, the Democratic candidate called on the vice president to clean up his campaign. &quot;When you put garbage out on the street,&quot; he said, &quot;you've got a responsibility to clean it up.&quot;    In recent days, Mr. Dukakis has sharpened his criticism of his opponent. Earlier this week the governor, trying to personalize the economic issue he hopes will tip the presidential campaign, argued that Vice President Bush's plan to reduce the tax on capital gains was designed &quot;to give people like George Bush a tax break.&quot; Yesterday, he accused Mr. Bush of &quot;all kinds of misstatements and distortions.&quot;    Mr. Bush, apparently stung by the recent barrage of Democratic charges that he is running a dirty campaign, fired back by charging that Mr. Dukakis is out of the &quot;mainstream&quot; of economic thinking and is trying to incite class warfare. In campaign stops in Ohio, Mr. Bush asserted that Mr. Dukakis's new and sharper campaign rhetoric is designed to divide Americans.    &quot;I must say that I've been disturbed, as I've witnessed my opponent's campaign over the several past weeks, at the increasing appeals to class conflict,&quot; Mr. Bush said in a speech in Columbus, Ohio. &quot;Good heavens, this is the United States of America. In my view, there is no place in American public life for philosophies that divide Americans one from another and that excite conflict among them.&quot;    At one point, the vice president seemed to suggest Mr. Dukakis's policies would drift toward socialism. &quot;Around the world, governments are abandoning socialism, in all its various guises and degrees, and embracing the American model of low taxation, entrepreneurship and individual initiative,&quot; Mr. Bush said. &quot;Now isn't the time to throw America's gears full speed in reverse back to the '70s with policies that would stymie the competitive transformation of American industry. . . .&quot;    Mr. Bush has been trying to shift the campaign focus to the broad condition of the economy, stressing the declines in interest rates and inflation since 1980. He asserted that Mr. Dukakis would institute a federal &quot;industrial policy&quot; that would usher in heavy government intervention in business decison-making. His opponent's &quot;economic policies can't be understood as a rational approach to economic growth and the creation of jobs,&quot; Mr. Bush said.    In a further attempt to blunt charges of misleading campaigning, the Bush campaign released a 48-page fact sheet to buttress claims made in recent TV ads attacking Mr. Dukakis's record on defense and law-and-order issues.    And, in a new TV ad, the Bush campaign says &quot;Michael Dukakis deliberately misled 62 million Americans&quot; by asserting during the second debate that he didn't &quot;raid&quot; the pension funds of Massachusetts to help balance his state budget. Mr. Dukakis's campaign yesterday called the Bush advertisement &quot;a cynical lie, a smokescreen designed to hide the truth.&quot;    In fact, Mr. Dukakis did take excess money from old pension funds and used them to ease his budget problems, but whether that constituted a raid is a matter of dispute. Richard Manley, president of the nonpartisan Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, says that the taking of the funds didn't hurt a new pension system that the state had funded fully. &quot;The charge of the raid on the pension fund is just absolutely not true,&quot; he says.    Meanwhile, Dukakis campaign planners have booked the governor into taping sessions with Tom Brokaw of NBC News and with David Frost for a Fox Broadcasting program. Mr. Dukakis will grant a live CBS-TV interview to Dan Rather tomorrow, with running mate Lloyd Bentsen appearing tonight. Kitty Dukakis, the governor's wife, appeared on the Phil Donahue Show yesterday.    &quot;We've got to reach as many voters as possible with a clear view of Dukakis and to point up the lies of the Bush campaign,&quot; said Mr. Duncan.    As the campaign nears its finale, Mr. Dukakis is recognizing that his failure to project a warm, human image has hurt him. The other night Matt Keough, a 12-year-old student in the heavily Democratic community of Hayward, Calif., who is to portray Mr. Dukakis in a mock school debate, asked the real candidate for advice. &quot;You have a lovely smile, Matt,&quot; Mr. Dukakis replied. &quot;Use it.&quot;    ---   Gerald F.
