The circuits developed for combined systems are suited for theretro-fitting of existing steam power systems. They will keep their originallyhigher efficiency and require only little modifications. Special designsallow the circuits to be used in the operation of coal-fired steam generators.The report discusses three different designs and their operational features.</TEXT></DOC>
