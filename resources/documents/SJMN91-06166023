That's the first rule that has to go when you decide toplace a personal ad. So we'll make that Step One. To ignore that first line.;   Step 2: Face that the initial ad is meaningless anyway because none of us iswhat we appear to be for very long. One week I love hockey and the next all Iwant to do is whittle show ponies out of balls of wax. My personalityfluctuates, too. When everything is beautiful, no one can do wrong by me. WhenI'm in financial debt, I slap people more. In other words, no matter what youtell someone, by the time they hear it, it's a lie. That's OK, as long asyou're honest.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Eye  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  THE TRUTH ABOUT PERSONALS: SOMETIMES, YOUHAVE TO LIE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Gangster of LoveSend your problems, questions, confessions and sexual angst to The Gangster ofLove, eye, San Jose Mercury News, 750 Ridder Park Drive, San Jose, 95190.

There's a lesson to befound in that.;    Step 5: Before you even make up a new identity toryourself, decide what you want from this. Is it true love you're looking foror just someone to feed ducks with? One woman told me searching for true loveis not productive. &quot;I want to find someone compatible and get back to mylife,&quot; she said. When I told her I thought keeping love and life separate wasimpossible she said, &quot;Not if you work at it.&quot; Something to think about.;   Step 6: Once you decide what you're after, you can make up any persona youwant. But stay away from those celebrity look-alike descriptions because youonly end up sticking yourself with a lot of extra baggage. For example, if youlist yourself as a Mark Hamill Type, right away people are going to wonderwhether you mean the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Mark Hamill before he got his face burned offor the one that nobody wants to associate with now. Then you're gonna get somepeople who will automatically think Dorothy Hamill. And even though it's notintentional, you'll conjure up this image in people's minds of an impish manwith a flaming face figure skating with a red rose clenched in his teeth.;   Step 7: Don't use the phrase &quot;Animal Tolerant.&quot;;    Step 8: Some people liketo make lists about themselves. Don't. One statement can tell it all: Whitefemale who likes French wine and Tennessee whiskey seeks mate. Simple,telling, and cheap when you're paying by the line.;    Step 9: Don't describeyourself as &quot;Previously Owned.&quot;;    Step 10: Be sure you're sincere whencreating the attributes of your ideal mate. &quot;I'm a sincere guy looking for a5'6&quot; blue-black haired pharmacist who can supply my needs and blah, blah,blah.&quot; Again, as long as you're saying it and know that you're lying about iteverything is beautiful.;    Step 11: Remember, you are your ad. Some peopledon't understand that. Christian Gent. Caucasian, born again, Protestant(Southern Baptist) seeks 5'4&quot; Protestant (preferably Southern Baptist orPresbyterian) lady, not overweight, no dependents. I mean, what is this guytelling people? &quot;I'm a Christian (obviously fanatic) who doesn't like fatpeople and children.&quot;;    Step 12: You are only your ad until someone meetsthe real you. This is where that lying bit starts to lose appeal. One womantold me she started a correspondence with a guy she thought was &quot;sincere.&quot;&quot;But then I called him and got his answering machine and it was reallydisgusting,&quot; she said. &quot;He was using words like . . . 'groovy.' &quot; That was theend of that. I asked her: 'Don't you think he deserves another chance? I mean,it's not like you met him in person and he was wearing Dockers or something.&quot;&quot;No,&quot; she said, &quot;I'm not going to wait for something awful like that tohappen. It's over.&quot;  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910614  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  56  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  734  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday June 14, 199100166023,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
