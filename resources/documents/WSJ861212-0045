The British government gave its approval for the sale by Plessey Co., a British electronics maker, &quot;a few months ago&quot; after consulting with the U.S. government, according to a source who declined to be identified. But the consultation was intended only to check to make sure Washington didn't object to the sale and wasn't related to the U.S. government's own arms transactions with Iran, the source said.    Nevertheless, news of the approval -- first reported yesterday in the London Daily Telegraph -- is causing some embarrassment for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government because it coincides with the Iran arms-shipment scandal in Washington. A British Foreign Office spokesman confirmed that his government had discussed the sale &quot;with some friendly governments,&quot; but wouldn't say whether the U.S. was among them. Plessey and the U.S. Embassy in London declined to comment.    The Foreign Office spokesman characterized the granting of an export license to Plessey as a &quot;normal commercial&quot; act, rather than part of any political effort to curry favor with Iran. He defended the approval as consistent with the government's policy of allowing certain trades with Iran and Iraq.    Throughout the seven-year war between Iran and Iraq, Britain has maintained diplomatic and trade ties with both countries. </TEXT></DOC>
