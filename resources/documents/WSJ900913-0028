But bank experts worry that the lawmakers may overreactand argue that increasing the insurance premiums carriesrisks of its own.</LP><TEXT>   The Congressional Budget Office told the Senate BankingCommittee that, given current trends, it expects 600 to 700bank failures to occur by 1993, dragging the insurance funddown to about $4 billion, its lowest point ever, from itscurrent $13.2 billion. (There are 13,200 commercial banks andmutual savings banks insured by the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp.) A similar report warning of weakness in the insurancefund was issued by the General Accounting Office Tuesday.   The two reports leave the impression that the bankingindustry is in worse shape than it really is, bank analystssay. The banking industry is expected to lobby hard againstanother rise in the premiums they pay, arguing that Congressis overreacting to avoid any potential recriminations ifconditions do worsen.   Lobbyists for the industry attributed the reports to aCongress shaken to its core by the savings and loan bailout.&quot;The GAO numbers aren't a surprise to people who've beenstudying this for a time,&quot; said Robert Dugger, chiefeconomist for the American Bankers Association. &quot;But I thinkthere is a lot of alarming rhetoric being associated withit.&quot;   The lobbyists, and even the government auditors, note thata premium increase carries risks of its own, including apossible worsening of the credit crunch. &quot;An overreaction byCongress or the regulators could result in further downwardpressure in these already weak economic areas,&quot; said Mr.Dugger.   Real estate loans, especially in the Northeast, and theincreasing cash flow problems of many highly leveragedcompanies in the face of a possible recession are clearlyworrisome. But most analysts say a repeat of the thriftindustry collapse is not likely for banks, especially ascommercial banks are much better capitalized as a group andare still earning decent profits for the most part.   And although it is tough for banks to raise long-term debtand equity, short-term funds are still readily available forall but the handful of large troubled banks, said GregoryRoot, president of Keefe BankWatch, a bank rating agencyfollowed closely by money market investors.   Anxiety over the bank fund has Congress and theadministration in agreement that the regulators should bepermitted to raise bank insurance premiums. The TreasuryDepartment, which had kept its silence as it prepares adeposit insurance reform package at year end, said it willintroduce narrow legislation designed for speedy passage.Sen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), chairman of the SenateBanking Committee and Rep. Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas),chairman of the House Banking Committee, also have endorsedthe idea.   &quot;In my opinion, failure to enact such legislation beforeCongress adjourns in October could leave the FDIC powerlessto take actions that may be necessary to protect the bankinsurance fund should the economy continue to slow thiswinter,&quot; said Sen. Riegle.   Congress, facing scathing Sandamp;L criticism, is likely to actsoon to increase the insurance premium authority. &quot;We'd foolourselves if we thought there wasn't going to be plenty ofproblems in the banks,&quot; said Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.),a member of the House Banking Committee. &quot;It might be betterto make the banks pay more now than have the taxpayers paylater.&quot;   The FDIC has already raised insurance premiums to thestatutory limit, including a recently announced 4.5-centincrease for each $100 of deposits, which will take effectnext year. This represented 7.3% of the industry's 1989 netincome of $15 billion, after nonrecurring gains. After theincrease, the banks will pay 19.5 cents a year per $100 ofdeposits.   Regulators aren't yet saying what they would do withbroader authority to raise insurance premiums. &quot;We'll bestudying it, obviously,&quot; said William Seidman, chairman ofthe FDIC, which manages both the bank and thrift depositinsurance funds. Mr. Seidman recently wrote to Mr. Gonzalezendorsing the plan to allow greater flexibility withpremiums.   What makes the reports this week seem ominous for banks isthat the publicity generated did not note that the FDIC fundcovers many large mutual savings banks, which are owned bytheir depositors and are part of the thrift industry.Analysts say there is a greater chance of several largesavings banks failing in the near future than big commercialbanks. Indeed, analysts say the picture is not nearly asbleak for the commercial banking industry.   Helping to bolster the banking industry through itsgrowing problems, says James McDermott, director of researchat Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods, is its access to relativelyinexpensive deposits. Many banks are buying the deposits offailed savings institutions at less than it costs to purchasefunds in the open market.   Consultant William Isaac, a former FDIC chairman, suggestsseveral alternatives to a premium increase. One would be aspecial premium of 1% of deposits that banks would turn overto the FDIC to get the fund up to 1.7% of total deposits.That extra premium would pay interest to the banks and berefunded once the fund reached the desired level of 1.25% ofdeposits on its own. He also suggests diverting to the FDICfund the money earned by the Federal Reserve for thenon-interest bearing reserves banks now keep at the Fed.Currently the $15 billion or more earned each year on thosereserves are turned over to the Treasury.   The deposit insurance fund isn't in as much imminentdanger as the new warnings would indicate, says the FDIC'sJohn Bovenzi, deputy to Mr. Seidman. Mr. Bovenzi said hisagency &quot;has a problem&quot; with the GAO saying that the $13.2billion FDIC fund could be tapped for $8 billion ofliabilities from previous Southwest bank failures. Thoseassets, composed mostly of problem loans that are beingmanaged by solvent financial institutions, have already beenmarked to market, that is, their losses have already beenreflected by the fund.</TEXT></DOC>
