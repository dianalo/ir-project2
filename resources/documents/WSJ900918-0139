Environmental groups, which should beon the defensive in the Persian Gulf crisis, having blockedexploration of energy-rich lands on the outercontinentalshelf and in Alaska, are now supporting a bill introduced bySen. Richard Bryan (D., Nev.) that raises the corporateaverage fuel economy (CAFE) standard to 40 miles per gallonby the year 2000. This measure would &quot;have over 10 times theoil-savings potential of any new domestic oil fields,&quot; arguesChristopher Flavin, a Worldwatch Institute vice-president.The Bryan bill has already passed the Senate Commercecommittee.   CAFE requires auto manufacturers to achieve a specifiedaverage mileage, currently 27.5 mpg, for their entire fleets.In effect, auto manufacturers must balance production of &quot;gasguzzlers&quot; with smaller, more energy-efficient vehicles.</LP><TEXT>   So Mr. Flavin's argument sounds appealing -- until onerealizes that it means forcing manufacturers to make carsthat consumers don't want. Escalating gas prices during the1970s encouraged Americans to buy smaller, morefuel-efficient autos, but when gas prices fell in the 1980s,many consumers shifted back to larger vehicles. After all,energy is not an absolute value, but one that must bebalanced against comfort, convenience and safety.   Yet, through CAFE, the government continued to tell carmakers to produce more small autos. Manufacturers avoided thelaw's enormous fines only by using up credits &quot;banked&quot; whenCAFE was lower, cutting the production of big cars andpricing small cars under cost. The result was to increaselarge auto prices by as much as $1200, cut car sales andprofits and eliminate thousands of auto-worker jobs. (Theregulations also disproportionately hurt domestic firms,which concentrated on the big car market.) All told, theFederal Trade Commission figures that CAFE has cost theeconomy about $4 for every gallon of gasoline saved.   And CAFE almost certainly doesn't save as much gas aspredicted. Drivers, like all other human beings, respond toincentives. Increasing the price of large cars encouragesconsumers to hold onto older, less efficient autos longer;subsidizing small cars will not only encourage people tochoose a smaller over a larger vehicle, but also to buyanother car for, say, a teenager, resulting in more driving.Indeed, pushing people into more efficient cars is going tomake them more likely to drive more miles since they cantravel more cheaply.   In the end, though, the most important reason to reject aCAFE increase is that raising the level would kill thousandsof people. Car accidents are a daily event and the largervehicle usually wins: a person is four times as likely tosurvive a two car collision in a 4,000 pound car than in a2,000 pound car. Pulling people out of big cars and puttingthem into small ones is going to increase the number oftraffic fatalities sharply.   The exact size of the CAFE death toll remains a matter ofdispute. Early estimates ranged between 500 and 1,400 livesannually. In 1988 Robert Crandall of the BrookingsInstitution and John Graham of Harvard released acomprehensive study that found that CAFE had reduced theaverage auto weight by 500 pounds, thereby upping trafficfatalities by between 14% and 27%. That translates into anextra 2,200 to 3,900 deaths and 11,000 to 19,500 otherinjuries every year. &quot;If you consider safety factors, CAFE isa very costly social policy,&quot; says Sam Kazman of theCompetitive Enterprise Institute.   How do environmentalists respond to the human carnage fromtheir policies? First, they refuse to acknowledge theproblem. Second, they say that the added auto deaths justprove the need for more federal regulations, such asgovernment required airbags.   CAFE never made sense, but at least when Congress firstpassed the legislation in 1975 no one knew how expensive itwould be or how many lives it would risk. Today we know. CAFEshould be eliminated, not strengthened.   ---   Mr. Bandow, a fellow at the Cato Institute, is the authorof &quot;The Politics of Plunder: Misgovernment in Washington,&quot;newly published by Transaction.</TEXT></DOC>
