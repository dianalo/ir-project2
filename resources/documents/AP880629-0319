The lawmakers cited testimony by officials of London-basedB.A.T., the world's largest tobacco company, that following aB.A.T. takeover of the Farmers Group, the insurance company wouldhave to stop publicizing the U.S. surgeon general's findings thatsmoking is hazardous.   Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio, chairman of the Energy and Commercesubcommittee on transportation, tourism and hazardous materials,said B.A.T. officials told the Oregon Insurance Commission lastmonth that ``B.A.T. believes the surgeon general was wrong.''   Farmers Group says it was one of the first insurance companiesto offer non-smoker discounts for life insurance policies and ledthe industry in offering non-smoker discounts for auto andhomeowners' insurance.   William Braddock, vice president of marketing for the group,said the company distributes anti-smoking brochures and hassponsored anti-smoking campaigns with public health groups. He saidthe company bans smoking at its home and regional offices, helpspay for non-smoking clinics for employees and bans tobacco ads inits monthly magazine.   ``We urge you to consider whether it is in the public interestfor a massive British tobacco company to take over America'spremier anti-smoking insurance company,'' Braddock said intestimony submitted to the subcommittee.   ``It is inconceivable that a parent organization whose existencedepends on tobacco and the avoidance of tobacco liability wouldpermit a subsidiary insurance company to actively engage inadvocating non-smoking,'' Braddock said.   B.A.T., a holding company, is mounting the takeover attemptthrough its subsidiary, BATUS, the owner of Brown andamp; WilliamsonTobacco Corp., one of America's largest tobacco companies.   William Rosenblatt, a lawyer representing BATUS, said BATUS andB.A.T. officials have consistently told state insurancecommissioners ``that Farmers will be encouraged to continue tomarket its non-smoker policies. This makes good business sense.''   In his own testimony to the subcommittee, Rosenblatt also saidthe officials have testified that Farmers generally would be leftto determine how to promote its non-smoker policies.   ``If, however, a particular brochure ... makes affirmativestatements inconsistent with BATUS' position on smoking and health,BATUS officials have testified that they would not permit such apublication to be distributed,'' Rosenblatt added.   Luken said tobacco conglomerates formed through takeovers andmergers ``accentuate the insidious power of the cigarettemanufacturers to prevent the development of anti-smoking healthpolicies.''   No legislation is pending on the matter, but Luken said hewanted to raise public and congressional awareness of the issue.   Luken was joined by Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who said Farmers'assets could be jeopardized as a result of health lawsuits pendingagainst B.A.T.'s tobacco subsidiaries.   Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas, said the takeover also would bedetrimental because B.A.T. is 10 percent owned by foreigngovernments.   BATUS launched its hostile takeover attempt Jan. 13 by offering$60 a share to holders of Farmers stock. It raised the offer to $63a share, for a total of $4.5 billion, on March 3. That offer isstill in effect and as of June 17, holders of 28 percent of Farmersstock had offered to sell their shares.   BATUS is seeking permission to operate an insurance company fromregulators in nine states where Farmers does business. Arizona hasapproved the company's application, while California has rejectedit on the basis of the foreign government ownership _ a decisionBATUS is appealing in court.   Hearings have been completed in Oregon, Idaho and Illinois andare in progress in Ohio. Insurance officials in Kansas, Washingtonand Texas still must hold hearings.</TEXT></DOC>
