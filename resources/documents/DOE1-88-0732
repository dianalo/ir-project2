<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-88-0732 </DOCNO><TEXT>This study uses a capital-market approach to measure the impact of hazardous-wastemismanagement lawsuits on the value of the firm. Lawsuits are eitherto recoup the cleanup costs of mismanaged sites or to receive compensationfor personal damages. The two states in the litigation process examinedfor capital-market reactions were the initial filing of the lawsuit (87cases) and the court decision/settlement (62 cases). The Cumulative PredictionError (CPE) technique is used to measure the size and statistical significanceof the abnormal returns, using daily stock return data from CRSP database.The null hypothesis is that shareholders are not significantly penalizedby the market for their firms involvement in a hazardous-wastes mismanagementlawsuit. A cross-sectional model is developed using multiple regressionto explain the variation in the abnormal returns. The results of thestudy indicate that, on average, shareholders suffer losses of about1.1% on the filing of a lawsuit. These losses are statistically significantat conventional levels, suggesting that shareholders are penalized fortheir firms hazardous-waste mismanagement. Further analysis indicatesthat shareholders suffer an average decrease in the value of the firmof about $30.166 million per lawsuit.</TEXT></DOC>
