(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An 82-year-old ex-convict charged withmurdering two sheriff's deputies is mentally unfit to stand trialbut will likely remain locked up for the rest of his life, aprosecutor says.   ``We can't try him because he can't understand the chargesagainst him or assist in his defense. If he is ever found competentto stand trial, we'll start the trial process right away. He won'tbe freed,'' said District Attorney General Paul Summers.   The suspect, Ule Reynolds, is charged with shooting twoLauderdale County sheriff's deputies in January. The deputies weregiving Reynolds a ride in their cruiser after finding him late atnight in a disabled car.   Authorities say the deputies, Bobby Nolen, 55, and Kevan Ward,31, apparently put Reynolds in the back seat of the cruiser withoutsearching him for weapons.   Reynolds, who has a criminal record dating from 1927, was armedwith a .357-caliber Magnum revolver in a shoulder holster,authorities said.   A resident of Gary, Ind., Reynolds apparently ran his car into aditch near Ripley while driving alone to Tennessee to attend thefuneral of a cousin, investigators say.   Summers said doctors at the Middle Tennessee Mental HealthInstitute at Nashville have examined Reynolds and found him to besenile.   A Lauderdale County circuit judge accepted that finding Fridayand ruled Reynolds incompetent to stand trial, Summers said.   Prosecutors have asked for Reynolds to be committed to a mentalinstitution and the court is expected to review his status nextmonth, Summers said. He has remained in custody without bond sincehis arrest.   Reynolds' relatives and friends have told authorities that hismental abilities have deteriorated in recent years. His wife,Minnie, said he told her after the shooting that he thought thedeputies were taking him to jail.   Reynolds, a barber, was convicted of manslaughter in Tennesseein 1927 and served a two- to five-year prison sentence. He hadseveral arrests on charges involving firearms over the years andwas convicted in 1975 in Indiana on a weapons violations and withtrying to tamper with a jury in a criminal case.</TEXT></DOC>
