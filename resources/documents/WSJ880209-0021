Stevens (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> EUROP JAPAN FREST CANDA </CO><IN> PCS CMD MON FRX </IN><TEXT>   The dollar was off slightly against most major currencies after trading in a narrow range, as traders predicted little action until U.S. merchandise trade data for December are released Friday.    &quot;The market's on hold,&quot; Francoise Soares-Kemp, treasury vice president at Credit Suisse, New York, said. Until the Commerce Department issues the U.S. trade figures, &quot;it's going to be a pretty boring week,&quot; she added.    A strike by workers at Ford Motor Co.'s British plants put the pound under pressure yesterday, as it eased to $1.7495, from $1.7530. The Ford strike and other labor problems in Britain raised concern about inflation in the U.K. as a result of higher wage demands. Britain reported yesterday that U.K. producer output prices rose 0.7% in January from December, following a 0.2% rise in December from the previous month.    The pound has &quot;lost a bit of its short-term luster, but I don't think it's in any big trouble,&quot; Trevor W. Woodland, vice president of foreign exchange at Harris Trust andamp; Savings Bank, Chicago, said.    The dollar slipped into a narrow trading range where dealers said it will probably remain until the report on merchandise trade. Market participants generally expect the report to show a further narrowing of the U.S. trade deficit from the $13.22 billion gap reported for November. Hence, although the dollar eased against most major currencies yesterday, it remained well supported within a slim trading range. &quot;There's no reason to sell dollars (aggressively) at this point,&quot; Axel Coym, vice president and chief trader at Westpac Banking Corp., New York, said.    In late New York trading the dollar was quoted at 1.6998 West German marks, off from 1.7020 Friday. The dollar also slipped to 128.83 Japanese yen, from 129.43.    In midmorning trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was quoted at 128.95 yen.    Traders largely ignored reported remarks concerning the dollar by Federal Reserve Board Governor H. Robert Heller yesterday. Mr. Heller was quoted as saying that the dollar was at a &quot;realistic&quot; exchange rate that will lead to a &quot;substantial reduction&quot; in the U.S. trade deficit.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $1 an ounce to $440.40 in light trading. The estimated volume was two million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $441.45 an ounce in early trading Tuesday in Hong Kong.    ---                     LATE NEW YORK TRADING                      Monday, Feb. 8, 1988    Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
