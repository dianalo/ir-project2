Blue-chip issues paced the advance, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 15.09 to 2058.36. The average had risen nearly 11 points Monday.    Broader market averages, which couldn't keep pace with the industrials the day before, did so yesterday. The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index climbed 1.44 to 263.00, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index added 0.74 to 148.57.    Big Board volume jumped to 176.9 million shares from 136.5 million Monday, but heavy dividend-related trading in American Electric Power inflated yesterday's turnover. The stock, which gained 1/8 to 27 1/4, carries an 8.2% dividend yield and goes ex-dividend today. Volume in the stock yesterday was 45.7 million shares.    The Big Board's most active list also included four stocks that have become targets of takeover-related activity -- Gillette, USG, F.W. Woolworth and Arkansas Best.    Prices gradually firmed until late in the session, when the industrial average peaked with an advance of about 22 points. The market then retreated in the final hour as buying interest began to wane.    Traders attributed the gains to covering of short, or oversold, positions as well as firmness in the bond market and the dollar and continued interest in blue-chips after a recent string of better-than-expected earnings reports.    &quot;The major theme right now is that the economy is stronger than expected and that blue-chip earnings are better than expected,&quot; said William J. King, head of equity trading at Nikko Securities Co. International.    The market's advance came as the Big Board announced that it has begun requiring member firms to submit daily reports about the program trading they do for their own accounts and for clients.    There wasn't any indication that any large amount of program trading took place yesterday, partly because trading in the popular Sandamp;P 500 index futures was shut down for most of the morning because of technical problems at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.    Joseph A. DeMarco, managing director for equity trading at the Marinvest unit of Marine Midland Corp., said the disclosure requirements represent &quot;a form of self-legislation&quot; on the Big Board's part that could ease widespread concern about the impact of index arbitrage and other forms of computer-assisted trading on the market.    &quot;The exchange is taking a step in the right direction,&quot; Mr. DeMarco said. &quot;Program trading has been a real deterrent to everyone. We've lost the individual investor because he can't play in a casino-like environment.&quot;    Michael Metz, a senior vice president and market strategist at Oppenheimer andamp; Co., said the new rules hold out &quot;some hope that we've seen the peak impact of the crapshooters on the market&quot; and that a &quot;more orderly and deliberative environment&quot; may lie ahead.    Ralph Bloch, chief market analyst at Raymond, James andamp; Associates, St. Petersburg, Fla., said the market's latest advance occurred against a backdrop of high cash levels and &quot;near universal skepticism&quot; on the part of investors.    Mr. Bloch said he views the market's advance as the first step in a rally that should carry the Dow Jones industrials to their highest levels since the market's crash last October. The current post-crash peak occurred April 12, when the average closed at 2110.08.    Mr. Metz agreed that the average is likely to reach that level eventually. He said the market already has taken into account the possibility of higher inflation and interest rates, a lack of interest in U.S. stocks on the part of foreign investors and expectations that Friday's U.S. unemployment report for April will show a sharp increase in non-farm payrolls -- another possible harbinger of inflationary economic growth.    Given all that, Mr. Metz said, the low trading volume yesterday, outside of the dividend and takeover stocks, can be viewed as positive for the market. &quot;Most participants are underexposed to equities, so their next change in strategy will be to buy a little bit more,&quot; he said.    Tobacco stocks fell in the wake of a Minnesota appeals court ruling that the federally mandated health warnings printed on cigarette packages since 1966 don't insulate the tobacco unit of RJR Nabisco from claims that it failed to warn consumers about the dangers of smoking. RJR tumbled 1 1/8 to 49 7/8, Philip Morris lost 1 1/2 to 88 1/4, American Brands fell 3/8 to 44 1/4, and Loews, which owns Lorillard, slipped 3/8 to 69 1/4.    F.W. Woolworth jumped 3 1/4 to 60 1/2 amid rumors that Dart Group was buying its shares. A partnership controlled by Dart Chairman Herbert Haft has been cleared to acquire as much as 15% of the company. Neither the Haft family nor Woolworth would comment on the speculation.    Gillette dropped 1 3/8 to 39 7/8 as a preliminary vote count showed that the company won its proxy fight with Coniston Partners. The partnership, which has called for the company to be sold, said it may challenge the results of the voting for four board seats.    Control Data gained 1 3/4 to 26 5/8. The Wall Street Journal reported that the Belzberg family of Canada has a stake in the company and may be considering a takeover bid.    USG advanced 3 1/8 to 44 5/8 in response to its recapitalization and restructuring plan aimed at fending off a hostile takeover offer from Desert Partners. Its holders would receive cash and debentures valued at $42 for each share, along with one share in the recapitalized company. The company would sell its Masonite unit and the Kinkead division of its USG Industries unit.    Arkansas Best, which surged 7 1/8 Monday, was off 1/4 at 22 3/4, still well above the $20 a share to be offered by a pair of New York investment partnerships for the shares they don't already own. The partnerships hold a combined 10.2% stake in the company.    Thompson Medical jumped 3 7/8 to 19 1/8 after receiving a $20-a-share buy-out offer from a group led by its chairman, Daniel S. Abraham. The group owns about 70% of the company's shares outstanding.    Gould added 2 to 13 3/8. The company agreed to sell its industrial automation division for $290 million to West Germany's AEG as part of a major restructuring and plans to repurchase as much as 20% of its common.    The American Stock Exchange index gained 0.76 to 303.22. Dataproducts slipped 3/4 to 9. The company will take a $16 million charge for the year ended March 26 for relocation of its serial printer business and a change in its foreign earnings reinvestment policy.    Fidata added 3/8 to 6 1/4. Montgomery Medical Ventures II, a San Francisco-based investment partnership, said it holds 5.1% of the company's common and may seek control. </TEXT></DOC>
