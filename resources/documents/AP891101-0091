Bakker, once one of the most influential televangelists in thenation, was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Robert Potter toa fitting 45 years in prison and fined $500,000 for defrauding hisfaithful followers of millions of dollars to finance his luxuryhomes, cars and vacations.   Had Judge Potter strictly observed his reputation for severepunishment, he could have sentenced Bakker to a maximum of 120years and a fine of more than $5 million. Many of his disillusionedflock would say he deserved the maximum.   One of the most disturbing aspects of Bakker's sensationalsix-week trial was his general lack of remorse. Although headmitted he had sinned, he steadfastly maintained he had notcommitted fraud.   His insistence, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary,that he was innocent of the 24 charges of swindling followers ofhis Praise The Lord (PTL) ministry illustrates a moral bankruptcythat offers little hope for rehabilitation.</TEXT><TEXT>   Oct. 27   West Central Tribune, Willmar, Minn., on Bakker's sentence:   As much as we abhor the fraudulent ``ministry'' of Jimmy Bakker,we think the sentence handed down upon his conviction was extremelyharsh for a non-violent crime. Forty-five years and a $500,000 fineare far greater than sentences for many violent crimes.   But in the long run, it will make Bakker a martyr. In a fewyears, with time off for good behavior, he will be right back wherehe was before, raking in money from his followers.   While Bakker was guilty of fraud, a part of the blame shouldrest with the people foolish enough to give him so much money.Separating people from their money is the goal of every economicventure. Most of the time, people get something in return.   In Bakker's case, perhaps they were trying to buy their way intoheaven.</TEXT><TEXT>   Oct. 28   Central Maine Morning Sentinel, Waterville, Maine, on Bakker'ssentence:   Jim Bakker finally is behind bars where he will spend at least10 years in the company of his kind of people _ thieves andswindlers.   The 45-year prison sentence and $500,000 fine handed down byU.S. District Court Judge Robert Potter should send a clear messageto those who think fame and wealth will save them from a commonjail cell.   Criminals are criminals, whether they are millionaire TVevangelists, Wall Street wizards, or street-savvy cocaine dealers.And it can be argued that the Jim Bakkers and Ivan Boeskys of theworld deserve the harsher punishments because they have the toolsto be immensely successful without breaking the law.</TEXT><TEXT>   Oct. 29   Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal on accountability of the FederalReserve Board:   Two Democratic members of the U.S. House of Representatives wantto extend political accountability to the Federal Reserve. That's aquaint concept, ``political accountability,'' coming from aninstitution where incumbents are virtually guaranteed re-electionuntil their dotage.   Legislation sponsored by Reps. Lee Hamilton and Byron Dorganwould open up operations of the Fed and make it more accountable _and more responsive _ to Congress and the administration.   Our statesmen in Washington might wield this new economic powerwisely. Or they might just let monetary policy flap in thepolitical winds like fiscal policy has in recent years as Congressand presidents scrambled to serve parochial interests and specialconstituencies.   The legislative and executive branches play an enormous role inthe nation's economy already. Of course, neither is willing toaccept responsibility for the budget deficits that sap the economy.   The proper reply to advocates of putting the Federal Reserveunder the thumb of Congress and the president: Get real.</TEXT><TEXT>   Oct. 26   St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times on campaign contributions:   The big lie of American politics is that hundreds of millions ofdollars in campaign contributions don't influence the politicianswho take them. Five senators who are up to their necks in thesavings and loan scandal might as well save their breath.   The five brought heavy pressure on federal regulators to ease upon Lincoln Savings andamp; Loan Association of Irvine, Calif., which atthe time was hellbent for a $2.5 billion insolvency. ...   Unlimited campaign spending has long since turned Americanpolitics into a moral swamp, yet Congress seems to have beenwaiting for some one big scandal to force it to act. That fragrantpackage now sits on its doorstep, waiting only for the SenateEthics Committee to unwrap it.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
