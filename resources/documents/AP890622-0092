It was the sternest statement to date issued to the NationalLeague for Democracy and came one day after the shooting at therally organized by the league.   ``The government has been tolerant for a long time. The partyconcerned will have to bear the consequences of irresponsible andillegal acts,'' a spokesman for the military government told a newsconference. ``It must be remembered that martial law is in force.''   The spokesman, Kyaw San, accused the party and its leader, AungSan Suu Kyi, of inciting the public to defy laws, of urging studentsto form ``suicide squads,'' and of organizing demonstrations tocommemorate last year's pro-democracy uprising.   Wednesday's incident appeared to be one of the most seriousoutbreaks of anti-government agitation since September, when troopscrushed demonstrators in a hail of gunfire.   The official Radio Rangoon said Wednesday night that about 500people gathered at Myenigon Circle north of downtown Rangoon to give``agitating speeches,'' chant slogans and lay bouquets at the site.   Witnesses said demonstrators were honoring pro-democracydemonstrators killed by government forces at the spot on June 21,1988.   The radio said security personnel fired five warning shots todisperse the crowd and took into custody Aung San Suu Kyi. She wasreleased after being ``warned not to create disturbances,'' theradio said.   While the opposition leader was in custody, 100 of thedemonstrators ``shouted and charged at security personnel with whatappeared to be an intent to attack the security personnel,'' theradio said.   One person was killed and one wounded when one of the securitymen fired three shots ``to stop the charge,'' the broadcast added.   The radio also said one ``disturbance maker'' was arrested with24 pamphlets inciting trouble as 30 youths tried to enter the campusof Rangoon University on Wednesday.   Aung San Suu Kyi, the daughter of a late national hero, Gen. AungSan, has emerged as the leading opposition figure to Burma'smilitary government, headed by Gen. Saw Maung.   The government has promised elections next year and allowed theformation of political parties but still rules by martial lawdecree. Some campaigning by the opposition groups has been allowedbut on occasion Aung San Suu Kyi and others have been harassed.   Burma has been under authoritarian, military-backed rule since1962, when Gen. Ne Win overthrew a democratic government. Last year,the country exploded into violence as hundreds of thousands took tothe streets to demand democracy.   Several thousand civilian protesters were killed over a period ofseveral months before Saw Maung stepped in to take power.</TEXT></DOC>
