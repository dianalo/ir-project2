L. 100-667, amended the CopyrightAct, title 17 of the United States Code, by creating a new statutory licensefor certain secondary transmissions made by satellite carriers to satellitehome dish owners. As of January 1, 1989, satellite carriers are permitted,pursuant to the new section 119 license, to make secondary transmissionsof ``superstation'' and network station signals to certain satellite homedish owners for private home viewing upon payment of a statutory royaltyfee and satisfaction of certain other conditions. The royalty fee provisionsof section 119 will end in four years, and will be replaced by privatelynegotiated licenses or an arbitrated fee on or before December 31, 1992.The entire Satellite Home Viewer Act itself terminates on December 31,1994. On February 28, 1989, the Copyright Office published proposed regulationsregarding statements of account and filing requirements for the satellitecarrier statutory license (54 FR 8350). At that time the Office invitedinterested parties to comment on the proposed regulations. Interested partieswere also welcome to comment on the terms of section 119 itself, as ittook effect January 1, 1989. Comments were invited through March 30, 1989.The Copyright Office received seven comments, including three from representativesof satellite carriers, three from representatives of program suppliers/copyrightowners, and one from the Public Broadcasting Service (``PBS''). One additionalset of reply comments was received after the March deadline from representativesof Program Suppliers. <ITAG tagnum="84">2. Statement of Account Filing Deadlines </ITAG>The Copyright Office proposed that satellite carriers availing themselvesof the statutory licensing system under section 119 must submit royaltyfees and statement of account forms within one month after the closingdate of the appropriate accounting period. These accounting periods runfrom January 1 to June 30, and from July 1 to December 31 of each year.Therefore, filings would be due on January 30 and July 30 of each yearfor the preceding six month period. Of the seven parties commenting in this proceeding, one satellite carrier,United Video, Inc. (``United Video''), objected to the proposed filingtime frame, saying the 30 day requirement was too stringent. Instead, UnitedVideo suggested a filing period equal to or greater than the 60 day periodwhich applies to cable operators under the cable television compulsorylicense. 17 U.S.C. 111. Representatives of Professional Sports Leagues, however, supported the30 day filing period, suggesting in addition that filings not made withinthe thirty day period be subject to a late payment fee. Program Suppliers, representing copyright owners, and backed in generalby the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (``ASCAP''),expressed general support for the body of regulations proposed by the CopyrightOffice to implement section 119. The Copyright Office considers the 30 day filing requirement for satellitecarrier statements of account to be reasonable. Care has been taken tolimit the amount of information satellite carriers are required to submitwith the statement of account forms. These forms are much less complexthan those that cable television operators file semiannually under section111's cable compulsory license. The calculations used to compute the satellitecarriers' royalty fees are uncomplicated. For administrative reasons, theOffice prefers to establish a filing deadline for satellite carrier statementsof account that differs from the deadline for cable statements of account.For these reasons, the final regulations adopt the requirement that royaltyfees shall be submitted by satellite carriers along with the appropriatestatement of account forms within one month after the closing date of therelevant accounting period. The Office declines at this time to address the issue of levying penaltyfees upon satellite carriers that make late filings, except that underpaymentsand late payments will be assessed interest charges, as discussed later.<ITAG tagnum="84">3. Refund Request Filing Deadline </ITAG>In its proposed regulations for implementing section 119, the CopyrightOffice described conditions under which a request for a refund of royaltyfees may be considered. The Office proposed that any such request mustbe received in the Copyright Office before the expiration of 30 days fromthe last day of the applicable statement of account <T3>filing period. </T3>Representatives of two satellite carriers, United Video and Southern SatelliteSystems (``Southern'') suggested this is too brief a time allowance. Southernreasoned that the 60 day refund period afforded to cable operators undersection 111's refund request policy should be mirrored in section 119'srefund request regulation. United Video made a similar argument but askedfor a one year period for filing refund requests and corrections on thebasis that final distribution of royalty fees to copyright owners by theCopyright Royalty Tribunal does not usually occur ``for several years afterthe Statements of Account are filed.'' The Copyright Office finds these arguments unpersuasive. The fact thatdistribution of royalty fees to copyright claimants may not occur for quitesome time is not determinative. A satellite carrier that files its statementof account form promptly will be able to detect whether to request a refundby an immediate, timely review of its copy of the filing. In addition,as the Office stated in the proposed regulations, ``[a] request for a refundis not necessary where the Licensing Division, during its examination ofa Statement of Account or related document, discovers an error that hasresulted in a royalty overpayment. In this case, the Licensing Divisionwill forward the royalty refund to the satellite carrier owner named inthe Statement of Account without regard to the (30 day) time limitations* * *'' 54 FR 8350, 8354 (February 28, 1989). The modest information required by the satellite carrier statement of accountform and the straight-forward method of calculating the royalties shouldmean that refund requests are infrequent. Satellite carriers should makefewer errors compared to cable systems and the review of the statementsof account should take less time. The Office would compare the satellitecarrier filing requirements to those relating to the jukebox compulsorylicense, for which a 30 day refund period has been found reasonable. For these reasons, the Copyright Office adopts the proposed regulationwhich requires requests for refunds to be received in the Office within30 days from the last day of the applicable statement of account filingperiod.<ITAG tagnum="84">4. Assessment of Interest on Late Payments, Underpayments, or Refunds</ITAG>The proposed regulations contained no reference to assessment of intereston late royalty payments or underpayments. However, one commentator, theProgram Suppliers, recommended that the Office address the issue, suggestingnot only that interest be assessed on late payments, but also that theOffice pay interest on any amounts refunded to satellite carriers properlyand justifiably requesting refunds. The Copyright Office agrees that theissue of interest in relation to section 119 payments should be addressed.The Copyright Office has decided that it should adopt an interest rulerelating to section 119 royalty underpayments and late payments. Althoughthe Copyright Act is silent on the question of interest in the contextof underpayments, the Office believes its general rulemaking authority,when read in the light of the decision in <T3>Cablevision Systems Development Corp. </T3>v. <T3>Motion Picture Association of America, </T3>836 F.2d 599, 610 (D.C.Cir.), <T3>cert. denied, </T3><T2>XX</T2> U.S. <T2>XX </T2>(1988), provides the necessary authority for the Office toconsider and adopt an interest rule for the satellite carrier statutorylicense. The Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. 702, provides that ``[t]he Registerof Copyrights is authorized to establish regulations not inconsistent withlaw for the administration of the functions and duties made the responsibilityof the Register under this title.'' It is apparent that the operation ofthe statutory license and the collection of royalty funds is part of thefunctions and duties of the Register. The goal of the statutory license is to guarantee that copyright ownersreceive full compensation for use of their works within the scheme of thelicense, while at the same time allowing private home viewers access toretransmitted signals they receive from satellite carriers that satisfythe terms of the license. When royalty payments are not made on time inaccordance with the terms of the license, the goal of full compensationis frustrated and the copyright owners suffer from the present value lossof funds. The Copyright Office therefore concludes that it is consistentwith the intention of Congress to impose a rule requiring interest paymentson underpaid royalties pursuant to the satellite carrier statutory license.As for the applicable rate of interest to be assessed on underpaymentsor late payments, the Office chooses a rate which most closely approximatesthe interest earned on royalty payments made within the accounting periodfiling dates. As a part of its standard practice, the Copyright Officewill be making deposits of recently received royalty funds with the U.S.Treasury on the first business day after the close of an accounting filingperiod. The interest rate paid on that deposit is readily obtainable fromthe U.S. Treasury within a day or so of the deposit. The Office feels thatmaking the Treasury rate applicable to all underpayments which resultedfrom satellite carrier retransmission to private dish owners during thataccounting period most closely equals the amount of interest the underpaidroyalties would have earned had they been paid in accordance with the accountingperiod filing deadlines. The one drawback of adopting such an interestrate is that it is not a fixed, predetermined rate. However, the Officeconcludes that this drawback is mitigated by the relative speed and certaintywith which the Treasury interest rate is available to the Office and thepublic. Therefore, the interest rate applicable under section 119 shallbe the interest rate paid by the Treasury on the royalty funds investedby the Copyright Office on the first business day after the close of thefiling deadline for the accounting period with respect to which the underpaymentoccurs. The interest will begin to accrue starting on the first day afterthe close of the relevant accounting period filing deadline. While the Copyright Office will be requiring interest on late paymentsand on underpaid royalties, it has concluded that it will not pay intereston refunds made to satellite carriers. Payment of interest on refunds madeunder section 119 is administratively impracticable. The Office is notobliged by statute to include an interest charge with refund payments.Satellite carriers can avoid making overpayments by careful review of statementsof account before filing the statements. The Office concludes that thecopyright owners, which will bear the administrative costs of the refundprocedure, should not be required to bear the costs of interest assessmentprocedures as well. Satellite carriers submitting royalty payments in anuntimely fashion must include the proper interest charge with each payment.Satellite carriers must perform their own interest charge calculationsand may obtain the proper interest rate for the applicable accounting period(s)by contacting the Licensing Division, United States Copyright Office, 101Independence Avenue, SE., Washington, DC 20540, Telephone (202) 707-8150.Interest calculated in accordance with these regulations shall be compoundedannually. The accrual period for a particular royalty payment being submittedby a satellite carrier in which interest is due shall end on the date appearingon the certified check, cashier's check, or money order submitted, providedthat the payment is received by the Copyright Office within five businessdays of that date. If the payment is not received within five businessdays, then the accrual period shall end on the date of actual receipt bythe Copyright Office.<ITAG tagnum="84">5. Name and Address of Cable Systems Acting as Distributors </ITAG>Program Suppliers suggested additional reporting requirements be addedto satellite carriers' statement of account forms, and cable televisioncompulsory licensing statements of account as well. In particular, theysuggest that satellite carriers be required to submit with their statementof account forms the names and addresses of cable television systems thatalso serve as ``distributors'' as defined in section 119(d)(1). The informationcould be used to verify that cable systems correctly excluded revenuesfrom ``private home viewing'' as defined in section 119(d)(5), from thesubscriber and the gross receipts calculations used for reporting and paymentpurposes under section 111. The Copyright Office acknowledges that copyright owners and cable televisionsystems may want such information made available to them in order to verifythat cable systems that also function as section 119 ``distributors'' havereported correctly. The Office concludes that the best place for verificationof the correct allocation of royalty fee payments under sections 111 and119 would be on the cable television statement of account forms alone.With respect to the satellite carrier form, the suggested listing is rejectedas a burdensome reporting requirement for satellite carrier owners. TheCopyright Office will consider the best way to amend the cable televisionstatement of account forms to facilitate proper allocation of royalty paymentsunder sections 111 and 119. <ITAG tagnum="84">6. Computation of Subscriber Numbers for Statement of Account Filings</ITAG>This issue received the greatest attention from commentators. InitiallyProgram Suppliers and copyright owners agreed with the system proposedby the Copyright Office, and satellite carriers did not. The proposed regulation would have directed that royalty fees be calculatedon a monthly basis such that any subscribers receiving a network stationor superstation signal from a satellite carrier for <T3>any period </T3>of each month must be included in the monthly calculationfor that signal. This approach was fully supported by the ProfessionalSports Leagues, and backed in a general way by Program Suppliers and ASCAP.Netlink, Southern and United Video all objected to the proposed methodof calculation. Southern called the method ``unreasonable,'' and suggestedinstead calculating the royalty fee by using the average number of subscribersreceiving each signal each month. United Video termed the proposed methodof calculation ``inconsistent with the intent of the * * * Act,'' and saidthe proposed method would result in ``unnecessary, expensive and difficultrecordkeeping by the carriers.'' United Video recommended using subscribernumbers calculated at the end of each month, since business records andsubscriber information are maintained on a monthly rather than daily basis.Netlink called the proposed method of fee calculation inefficient, unfair,and ``inconsistent with the intent of the Act.'' It proposed using theaverage number of subscribers per month, saying this would be easier forcarriers to calculate, and would be ``more representative of the actualuse of the signal.'' In the alternative, Netlink suggested using the numberof subscribers as determined on the last day of each month. On April 25, 1989, the Copyright Office received Program Suppliers' replycomments to the original set of comments. The Program Suppliers made specificcomments about calculation of the number of subscribers each month forroyalty fee purposes. One method which had been suggested, that of usingthe average number of subscribers per month, was not appealing to ProgramSuppliers, who commented there was no wording in the Act itself to suggestaveraging monthly subscriber numbers. They also commented that becausevarious methodologies could be used to average subscribers, there was adistinct possibility of future disputes about royalty payments. Program Suppliers then recommended that the Copyright Office adopt a regulationwhich designates a specific date each month as the date on which to takea subscriber count. The example they used was the last day of the month.The Copyright Office notes that with the addition of the Program Supplierslatest comments, the parties that addressed the issue of the method ofcounting subscribers each month are in agreement, except for the ProfessionalSports Leagues. The Copyright Office has carefully reviewed the comments and suggestionsregarding the method of calculating royalty fee payments under the SatelliteHome Viewer Act of 1988, and has reviewed the legislative history of theAct and the language of the Act itself. The goal of section 119 is to guaranteethat copyright owners receive full compensation for the use of their workswhile allowing access to retransmitted network station and superstationsignals for private home dish subscribers. An additional goal is establishmentof royalty fee rates set by voluntary negotiation as instituted by section119(c)(2). When satellite carriers and copyright owners agree on a rateto be paid under section 119(c)(2), they may use whatever method of calculationthey can agree to.Satellite carriers and major representatives of copyright owners have basicallyagreed in their comments on terms by which to calculate royalty fees initially,that is, to set a specific point in time within the month from which tocount the number of subscribers that month. The Office at this time setsthe last day of the month as the date on which the subscriber count mustbe based for royalty fee calculations. However, the Office will not hesitateto revisit this question should any party come forward with specific examplesof unfairness or manipulation resulting from using subscriber numbers takenby satellite carriers on the last day of each month for use in calculatingsemiannual royalty fee payments.<ITAG tagnum="84">7. Status of Public Broadcasting Service Under Section 119</ITAG>PBS submitted comments devoted entirely to the question of the status ofPBS as a network station or a superstation under the Act. No other commentatordiscussed this topic. This proved to be a thorny issue, as it is difficultto reconcile the language in the text of the statute itself with languagecontained in part of the legislative history. More specifically, the HouseEnergy and Commerce Committee's report contained one specific referenceto PBS as a ``network station.'' \1\<NOTE/> On the authority of that one specific reference to PBS asa network station, the Copyright Office initially concluded that PBS shouldbe treated as a network. 54 FR 8350, 8352.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ ``* * * the new statutory license for retransmission ofnetwork stations applies, at the present time, exclusively to those stationsowned by or affiliated with the three major commercial networks (ABC, CBS,and NBC) and the stations associated with the Public Broadcasting Service.''134 Cong. Rec. 10426, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. (October 19, 1988).However, PBS demonstrated in its comments that according to the definitionsof ``network station'' and ``superstation'' in the Act, and according tolanguage found throughout the House Judiciary Committee report and hearingson the Act, references to network stations meant the three commercial networkstations only. PBS argued that ``as a <T3>legal</T3> matter, it is clear that PBS stations are `superstations'and not `network stations' under the Act.'' The Copyright Office, afterconducting a thorough review of the Act and its history, agrees with PBSon this point.Having argued that PBS stations are legally superstations under the Act,PBS next commented that it nevertheless wants the same treatment for PBSstations as network stations receive under the Act. That is, PBS contendsthat retransmission of PBS member stations under section 119 should beconfined to homes in ``unserved areas,'' as defined in the Act. PBS alsocontends that the three cent royalty rate applies for retransmission ofPBS stations, rather than the twelve cent rate for retransmission of superstations.The Copyright Office concludes that there is a need to clarify the statusof PBS stations under the Act, and the Office recommends that Congressshould legislate at an appropriate time. Until there is Congressional clarificationregarding the treatment of PBS in the Act, PBS is advised to take the followingaction. To be treated as the networks are treated, PBS should follow thesame filing requirements that networks must follow. According to section119(a)(2)(C), networks must place on file with the Copyright Office a documentidentifying the name and address of the person at the network to whom satellitecarriers must send notice of retransmission. The network notice shouldcontain the name of the network, the contact person, a full mailing addressand phone number. The notice should be sent to Walter Sampson, Chief, LicensingDivision, Copyright Office, Library of Congress, Washington, DC 20557,or, if hand delivered, Licensing Division, Madison Building, Room LM-458,101 Independence Avenue, SE., Washington, DC 20557 for placement in thepublic file. Thereafter, satellite carriers making secondary transmissionsof PBS stations should file subscriber lists with PBS in the manner setforth in section 119(a)(2)(C).Until Congress clarifies the status of PBS in the Act, the Copyright Officewill accept filings from satellite carriers using either the three centroyalty rate or the twelve cent royalty rate as applied to secondary transmissionsof PBS stations. The Office recommends to Congress that the definitionof ``network station'' in section 119(d)(2) be changed to: ``The term `networkstation' means a television broadcast station that is a member stationof the Public Broadcasting Service, or a television broadcast station thatis owned or operated by, or affiliated with, one or more of the televisionnetworks in the United States providing nationwide transmissions, and thattransmits a substantial part of that station's typical broadcast day.''<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act Statement</ITAG>With respect to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Copyright Office takesthe position that this Act does not apply to Copyright Office rulemaking.The Copyright Office is a department of the Library of Congress and ispart of the legislative branch. Neither the Library of Congress nor theCopyright Office is an ``agency'' within the meaning of the AdministrativeProcedure Act of June 11, 1946, as amended (Title 5, Chapter 5 of the U.S.Code, Subchapter II and Chapter 7). The Regulatory Flexibility Act consequentlydoes not apply to the Copyright Office since the Act affects only thoseentities of the Federal Government that are agencies as defined in theAdministrative Procedure Act.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The Copyright Office was not subject to the AdministrativeProcedure Act before 1978, and it is now subject to it only in areas specifiedby section 701(d) of the Copyright Act (i.e., ``all actions taken by theRegister of Copyrights under this title (17), except with respect to themaking of copies of copyright deposits''). (17 U.S.C. 706(b)). The CopyrightAct does not make the Office an ``agency'' as defined in the AdministrativeProcedure Act. For example, personnel actions taken by the Office are notsubject to APA-FOIA requirements.Alternatively, if it is later determined by a court of competent jurisdictionthat the Copyright Office is an ``agency'' subject to the Regulatory FlexibilityAct, the Register of Copyrights has determined and hereby certifies thatthis regulation will have no significant impact on small businesses.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 37 CFR Part 201</ITAG>Satellite carrier license.<ITAG tagnum="84"> Final Regulations</ITAG>In consideration of the foregoing, the Copyright Office is amending Part201 of 37 CFR, Chapter II in the manner set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="52"> PART 201_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
