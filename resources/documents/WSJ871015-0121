But in the past two weeks Senator Al Gore of Tennessee has launched a series of sharp attacks on the foreign-policy positions of his five rivals. In a field of contenders known for catering to the views of liberal activists, this is the political equivalent of a pit bull attack.    Senator Gore began by suggesting his rivals practiced &quot;the politics of retreat, complacency and doubt&quot; and claiming that &quot;my fellow candidates and I see the essential needs of our national security in very different ways.&quot; He staked out three areas of disagreement, saying that he favors President Reagan's tanker-reflagging policy, opposes a ban on flight testing of all ballistic missiles and supports &quot;humanitarian&quot; aid to the contras.    At a debate last week, the other candidates reacted with wounded anger and variously accused Senator Gore of &quot;knifing&quot; them and creating &quot;phony differences&quot; on defense issues. Mr. Gore responded by saying such a debate was necessary because of a &quot;nomination process which tends to push all of our candidates toward a single homogeneous view which is wildly attractive to a minority.&quot;    Obviously, Senator Gore's strategy is also designed to win him votes next March 8, when 14 Southern states with 55% of the delegates needed to nominate will hold a joint primary. Albert Gore Sr., the candidate's father and a former U.S. Senator, says, &quot;What you're seeing now is no accident. We've got to get the Dixiecrats {conservative Southern voters} back into the Democratic Party, and we're playing damn hard ball.&quot;    Of course, in baseball it helps if your pitcher has a strong record behind him when he steps onto the mound. Senator Gore's aggressive stance on defense issues is a trifle disorienting given the fact that his voting record puts him in the pro-defense minor leagues.    One of his rivals, Senator Paul Simon, points out that Mr. Gore has voted against Nicaragua's Contras on 18 out of 20 occasions. And the American Security Council, a conservative group, says Senator Gore voted in agreement with it only 20% of the time during 1986 -- a time when the Senator was pondering a run for the White House but did not yet know he would be the only Southerner in the race. Almost all of the Southern senators in his party have much higher ASC ratings. Even Democratic moderates such as Lawton Chiles of Florida and Lloyd Bentsen of Texas have scores of at least 70%. Sam Nunn, whose supporters Mr. Gore is trying to court, has a rating of 90%. &quot;Maybe the next debate should be between the old Al Gore and the new Al Gore,&quot; says Rep. Richard Gephardt.    Despite the suddenness of his conversion, we're pleased to see that Al Gore recognizes his party has won an average of only 42% of the vote in the past four presidential elections in large part because it is identified with weakness in foreign policy.    But voters will demand more than just tough talk on defense before they return to the Democratic fold. If Al Gore is sincere in distinguishing his views from that of the other candidates, he will have to lay out his case for a stronger defense in much sharper and more convincing detail. Otherwise, voters will be justified in borrowing a line from a previous candidate and demanding to know of Al Gore, &quot;Where's the beef?&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
