Guinness has said that the payments, currently equivalent to $38.4 million, may have been made in return for possibly illegal share buying to support the British brewer's $3.8 billion Distillers bid, which is the subject of one of the British government's biggest financial investigations in years.    Guinness yesterday confirmed the accuracy of a list of 11 parties -- which apparently includes Austrian, British, Indian, Swiss, U.S. and offshore companies -- that received the $38.4 million, but it repeated that it didn't know the precise identity of the beneficiaries of most of the payments. The list was originally broadcast yesterday by the British Broadcasting Corp., which didn't disclose its source.    Also yesterday:   --Guinness disclosed that Argyll Group PLC, loser in the battle for Distillers, this week offered a &quot;friendly&quot; merger with Guinness, apparently as a way out of legal action that the British supermarket concern has threatened. Guinness rejected the offer.    --Another prominent London merchant banker, Lord Spens, the head of corporate finance at Henry J. Ansbacher andamp; Co., resigned because of his involvement in Guinness share transactions during the bid. As with the resignation earlier this week of officials at Morgan Grenfell Group PLC, the resignation of Lord Spens apparently was at the strong urging of the Bank of England.    --The London stockbrokerage Alexanders Laing andamp; Cruickshank said Anthony K. Parnes, a stockbroker associated with the firm, &quot;believes&quot; that he is the intermediary who approached Heron International PLC regarding its involvement in the Guinness share-buying operation. Mr. Parnes couldn't be reached for comment.    But it was the Guinness list, promising further answers to the scope of a massive and possibly illegal stock manipulation, that electrified London yesterday. Bankers and brokers are worried that the spreading scandal will lead to a backlash against London's City, or financial district. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is being called on daily to defend her government's performance in getting to the bottom of the affair.    The list disclosed that the U.S. commodities-trading unit of Berisford, under its former name of Erlanger Co., received a $2.3 million payment from Guinness, and that Zentralsparkasse andamp; Kommerzialbank of Vienna, Austria, received a $390,144 payment. Zentralsparkasse didn't return a phone call late yesterday.    But in a letter to Guinness made public late yesterday, Berisford said that one of its units held 2.8 million Guinness shares acquired during and after the Distillers bid, and that Erlanger had received $2.3 million for services unrelated to the share buying.    The company denied that the stock position was acquired under any arrangement with Guinness, but it offered to return the $2.3 million if Guinness wanted to cancel services Berisford said it was performing for Guinness. The services, Berisford said, included the acquisition of goods that could be used to conduct barter arrangements to facilitate payments to Guinness in Nigeria and other countries.    The letter, signed by Berisford's chairman, Ephraim Margulies, said Berisford had mistakenly billed Guinness for the trade work with an invoice that said &quot;work in connection with the acquisition of Distillers.&quot; The trade arrangement was negotiated with Guinness during the bid period, Mr. Margulies said, by Thomas Ward, a Guinness director and Washington attorney who was on Guinness's takeover team. Guinness has asked Mr. Ward to resign.    Guinness's list also included parties previously known to be under suspicion from Guinness -- two units of Heron, which has returned $8.9 million it received; Morgan Grenfell, Guinness's financial adviser during the bid, for $2.5 million, and J. Lyons Chamberlayne andamp; Co., a concern in which British business consultant Sir Jack Lyons and Mr. Parnes are principals. J. Lyons was listed as receiving $460,800.    A Morgan Grenfell spokesman yesterday said that $2.5 million corresponded to payments the firm had received in December for financial advice to Guinness on several matters. These included a disclosed Guinness share repurchase after the bid, a board of directors reorganization, and several Distillers property dispositions.    &quot;These were perfectly legitimate transactions, which we invoiced and they paid without saying a word,&quot; the Morgan Grenfell spokesman said. &quot;And they haven't asked us about it since.&quot; However, a Guinness spokesman contradicted Morgan's account, saying the company's auditors have asked for an explanation of the fee, and received no &quot;satisfactory&quot; explanation.    Sir Jack, of J. Lyons Chamberlayne, has declined comment. Sir Jack is also the British adviser to Bain andamp; Co., the Boston financial consultants that helped Guinness direct the Distillers bid.    Government investigators are trying to learn whether the heavy buying that lifted Guinness's share price and the value of its bid for Distillers was illegal and, if so, who participated. Both Heron and Bank Leu AG of Switzerland have acknowledged buying Guinness shares in return for guarantees against losses from Guinness and, in the case of Heron, payments. Under British law, it is illegal for a company to buy its own shares without shareholder approval, or to pay others to do so.    Also on the Guinness list is an entity, called &quot;CIFCO,&quot; which received $3 million. CIFCO is the acronym used by Champaklal Investment andamp; Financial Consultancy, a Bombay, India, investments concern with a branch in London. A person answering the phone at CIFCO's London office said yesterday that no one was available to answer questions.    A Guinness spokesman said the company still isn't able to determine who is behind some of the other names on the list. But officials at the company say they suspect that at least some of the payments unaccounted for went to U.S. merger speculator Ivan F. Boesky, who was active in the British market during the Distillers bid, and is widely believed to have supplied information that led to the British inquiry. Mr. Boesky agreed to settle insider trading charges with U.S. authorities last November.    The other names on the Guinness list, their believed nation of origin, and the amounts they received are as follows:    Consultations et Investissetes (Switzerland), $5.1 million; Konsultat S.A. (Switzerland) $4.6 million; Marketing andamp; Acquisitions Consultants Ltd. (Jersey Islands) $8 million; and Rudani Corp. S.A. (Netherlands Antilles), $3 million. </TEXT></DOC>
