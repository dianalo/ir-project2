But those familiar with the negotiations said the two sides -- which haven't broken off talks -- are still likely to reach a settlement. They said that, if anything, the hearings, which are scheduled to resume Jan. 11, will put pressure on negotiators to reach agreement on victim compensation.    Meanwhile, Bhopal District Court Judge M.W. Deo, in a surprise move, said that on Dec. 7 he would hear a petition for interim relief that a victims' group filed last week. &quot;I have been really moved by the fact that the third anniversary of the disaster is drawing close,&quot; he said. Poison gas leaked from a Union Carbide pesticide plant in Bhopal on the night of Dec. 2 and 3, 1984, killing an estimated 2,500 people and seriously injuring 30,000 to 40,000 others.    Union Carbide objected to the granting of any interim relief on the ground that it would presume the company's liability in the disaster. The company contends that the leak was the result of a sabotage by an employee. &quot;Any order that directs us to involuntarily pay interim relief would be totally without precedent any place in the world,&quot; said a company spokesman at Union Carbide's headquarters in Danbury, Conn.    Previous deadlines imposed by the Bhopal court had been suspended to allow negotiators more time to reach an out-of-court settlement. The latest deadline was Friday, and the judge had said he would resume hearings if an agreement wasn't reached by then.    Although the Indian government is asking for $3 billion in damages on behalf of the victims, sources close to both sides have indicated that Union Carbide's offer has been in the range of $650 million.    The two sides declined to comment during the weekend on the progress of their negotiations. The Union Carbide spokesman would only say that &quot;there's no change in the (out-of-court) settlement status.&quot;    Analysts doubt that the two sides are prepared to go through with a trial, which in India's overcrowded court system could take months, or even years. For the Indian government, a trial would only delay the payment of compensation to the victims. For Union Carbide, a trial would create uncertainty because the company would be forced to carry a $3 billion liability on its books. &quot;Carbide can't make any aggressive moves in the market with that kind of liability,&quot; says one analyst, adding:&quot;Carbide is interested in settling because they want the case behind them.&quot;    Judge Deo's action is more of a tactical move than an indicator of an inability by the two sides to reach a settlement. Calvert Crary, who analyses litigation at Bear Stearns andamp; Co., said settlement talks can drag on if two sides are widely apart, as they are in this case on the compensation issue. &quot;It's very difficult to set deadlines and expect them to come up with a settlement,&quot; he said. &quot;There's a recognition on the part of the judge here that you need the pressure of litigation.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
