Under the pact, holders would receive for each Meston share either 2.35 new Campbell common shares or one Campbell preferred share, which is redeemable and can be converted into cash at the holder's option under certain terms.    Campbell, which has interests in gold, copper and coal, has about 38.2 million common shares outstanding and holds a 70% voting interest in Meston, a Montrealbased gold and copper mining concern. Meston has about 3.6 million subordinate voting shares outstanding that Campbell doesn't own.    Richard Lister, president of Campbell and Meston, said the companies decided to merge to consolidate mining operations at Quebec's Chibougamau gold camp.    In Toronto Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Campbell closed at 3.20 dollars ($2.43), up five cents (3.8 cents), and Meston closed at 6.75 dollars, up 25 cents.    Separately, Campbell said it sold 16.9 million dollars of securities privately, and it will issue a further 600,000 dollars of securities to two Toronto securities dealers. Proceeds from the issues will be used to redeem or to pay for the retraction of preferred shares to be issued to Meston holders, Campbell said.    The proposed merger requires approval from Campbell and Meston holders, who are expected to vote on it by December.    Campbell offered to buy the rest of Meston's shares outstanding last February. About 10% of Meston's shares were tendered under the offer. </TEXT></DOC>
