Anderson of Harvardhad designed an experiment that would measure the levels of the ClO (chlorinemonoxide) and BrO (Bromine monoxide) at the highest levels of ozonedepletion.andP;  If hypotheses proved accurate, these two chemicals were largelyresponsible for the erosion.andM;Anderson's team decided to use a PC in their experiment because it was easyto customize software under the DOS architecture and the PC bus was easy forscientific instruments to interface with.andP;  Retrofitted with higher-qualityparts such as military-specified (883B) chips on the system board towithstand the -90[degrees]F conditions, and sporting a hard disk enclosed inan atmospheric pressure chamber that simulated sea level, the PC was storedin the left wing pod of the ER-2.andP;  It controlled a multiple-axis resonancefluorescence chemical conversion detector for ClO and BrO, which collecteddata through 150 digital and analog channels.andP;  Eventually, the team alsodeveloped a customized operating system dubbed ADOS, which allowed the PC tooperate autonomously while in the air, running multiple programs to controlthe instrument and record its data.andM;After each successful flight, the scientists downloaded the data onto a tapeand transferred it to IBM PC-XTs on the ground, for immediate analysis withcustomized software.andP;  The tests proved conclusively that ClO and BrO damagedthe ozone.andM;The researchers also loaded a dozen computers, including a Toshiba T1000,Compaq 386s, and IBM PC Ats, full of custom statistical, graphical, andmathematical software, onto a DC-8 jet.andP;  The plane soared into the ozoneabove Antarctica 12 times in six weeks to sample air temperature, airpressure, wind speed, and trace gases in the stratosphere.andM;&quot;The point of bringing PCs was to find out what was going on in real time,&quot;says NASA scientist Susan Strahan.andP;  &quot;We would get feedback within hours fromthe plane's 14 instruments and have enough information to tell the pilot howhigh or where to fly the next time.&quot;andM;Not all expedition members used exotic custom programs.andP;  Atmosphericscientist Dennis Hartmann, one of the expedition's few Macintosh users,downloaded air-sample data into his Mac SE to analyze and graph themeasurements according to time, temperature, chemical mix, and wind velocity.andO;He ran the data through Abacus Concepts' StatView statistics package andCricket Software's CricketGraph graphics program.andM;&quot;Getting data so quickly from a mission was something that we had never donebefore,&quot; recalls Hartmann, a University of Washington professor.andP;  Thescientists were able to confirm suspicions that the industrial chemicalsknown as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were not only polluting the atmospherebut destroying the ozone layer.andP;  Their findings established that ice crystalsin the polar air absorb nitrogen--removing a buffer against the breakdown ofozone molecules caused by the chlorine compounds produced when CFCsdecompose.andM;The Prime SuspectandM;The environmental community put CFCs at the top of its hit list.andP;  Halting CFCproduction could prevent further damage.andP;  But the CFC compounds, widely usedin automobile air conditioners, foam packaging, and spray cans, represented alucrative industry, and their producers--multinational corporations like DuPont, Allied Signal, and Pennwalt--were not accustomed to making quickchanges.andM;Seeking to increase public awareness and further their case against CFCmakers, environmentalists found Lotus 1-2-3 to be a powerful ally.andO;Environmental Defense Fund economist Dan Dudek culled data from asupercomputer and plotted it on a 1-2-3 spreadsheet to create environmentalscenarios.andP;  Dudek used his forecasts to startle members of the HouseSubcommittee on Health and the Environment during his testimony in the springof 1987.andP;  If global CFC emissions weren't halted, his findings demonstrated,over 40 percent of the ozone layer would disappear in the next 90 years; thehalting of U.S.andP;  emissions alone could prevent 8 million cases of skin cancerover the same period.andM;Swayed by similarly alarming predictions, both the European community and theUnited States stepped up their commitment by vowing to cease CFCmanufacturing by the year 2000.andM;Yet the ozone drama has only begun.andP;  Scientists still need to assess thedamage that has been done and, perhaps more important, find safe alternativesto chlorofluorocarbons.andM;Worst-Case ScenariosandM;Until this year, climatologist Starley Thompson of the National Center forAtmospheric Research, in Boulder, Colorado, relied on the supercomputer tochurn out pages of computations for him to wade through.andP;  In January he begantaking advantage of the PC's graphical prowess.andP;  Combining PC and videotechnology, he turned hardcopy reports into animated renderings of oceancurrents and clouds.andM;Thompson garners information from a Cray sypercomputer and downloads climategraph simulations from a minicomputer into a custom 80386 PC outfitted with aTruevision Targa video capture board.andP;  After digitally copying each graphonto videotape, Thompson plays back the tape on a color monitor and observesthe reaction of the earth's elements to his scenarios.andP;  The effect is thesame as thumbing the pages of a flip book: the PC rapidly flips through thegraphs, allowing Thompson to detect changes among the maps, a process thatpreviously required hours of study.andM;&quot;I can spot trends much quicker on the television screen than on 100 chartsspread across my desk,&quot; says Thompson.andP;  &quot;The video gives us an understandingof chemical behaviors that we might not have had before.&quot;andP;  (See samplescreens on previous page.)andM;In a study sponsored by the Department of Defense, Thompson used animation todetermine the effect of a nuclear blast on the ozone layer.andP;  He watched asthe color representing nitric oxide changed to the shade symbolizing nitricacid and then back to nitric oxide.andM;The Search Goes OnandM;Just as critical as the environmental ramifications of ozone loss is thesearch for CFC substitutes.andP;  Lawrence Livermore chemist Peter Connell used apersonal computer to access supercomputer data and, using off-the-shelfsoftware, suggest replacements for the compounds.andM;After running a global CFC scenario on the Cray, Connell compiled the data onan IBM PC AT running Plot 88, a commercial plotting program from Plotworks,of La Jolla, California.andP;  Instead of waiting overnight to obtain a graphicalrendering on the Cray, Connell got his contour map of ocean currents, clouds,and earth surfaces in seconds.andP;  Eyeing such anomalies as an unusualcoloration or a drop in the middle of a temperature graph, he discovered thatdifferent CFC chemicals affect the stratosphere in different ways.andM;&quot;Certain CFC foam agents react differently and do not harm the ozone as muchas others,&quot; he explains.andP;  Based on the results of such tests, Connell andother scientists believe that hydrogen-based substitutes are safest.andM;The faster chemists test potential alternatives to CFCs, the soonerproduction can begin.andP;  CFC makers Du Pont, Allied-Signal, and Pennwalt areresearching substitutes, and two compounds--hydrofluorocarbons andhydrochlorofluorocarbons--are already under commercial consideration.andM;Du Pont, which manufactures 25 pecent of the world's CFCs, hopes to beginselling acceptable CFC replacements by 1990.andP;  To separate chemical propertiesso that safety levels can be determined, Du Pont scientists download datafrom measurement instruments to IBM PS/2s, where the information is analyzedand further broken down.andM;At Allied-Signal's Buffalo, New York, lab, a proprietary PC modeling packagehas identified at least three viable CFC replacements.andP;  The model displays acompound's thermodynamic properties, such as boiling point, allowingresearchers to compare its performance with that of CFCs.andM;&quot;We need this program to understand substitutes' reactions and performancesin various applications such as in solvents or refrigerators,&quot; explainsAllied-Signal chemist Rajat Basu.andP;  The program has been so useful that thecompany distributes parts of it to potential customers for their own testing.andM;But even the most scrupulous cleanup efforts won't produce immediate results.andO;Companies have been pumping millions of tons of CFCs into the atmospheresince the early 1960s.andP;  Once emitted, the chemicals linger; if the productionof all ozone-destroying chemicals ceased today, the toxic substances in theatmosphere would still take more than 100 years to decompose.andM;Still, putting a halt to CFC manufacturing is imperative.andP;  &quot;For every fiveyears we delay, it will take 20 years longer for the ozone to recover,&quot; warnsDavid Doninger of the Natural Resources Defense Council.andP;  Three percent ofthe earth's ozone layer has been lost already, according to the council.andM;The mystery is not yet solved.andP;  &quot;The technology we have now is part of thesolution, and we are coming up with answers much quicker than before,&quot; saysRobert Watson, chief of upper atmospheric research at NASA's troposphericchemistry branch.andP;  Unraveling the rest of the enigma, says Watson, requiresmore from people, not computers.andP;  &quot;Actually implementing the environmentalpolicies will be the key to solving this problem.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
