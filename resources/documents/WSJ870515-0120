Specifically, Mr. Weinberger wants U.S. negotiators to insist that the Soviets eliminate all of their medium-range missiles in Europe, and not deposit 100 of them in Asia as has been contemplated. Additional support for this tougher position came from many allied defense ministers convened here for the regular meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's nuclear-planning group.    During the U.S.-Soviet summit in Reykjavik, Iceland, last October, President Reagan accepted a Soviet proposal that 100 of the nuclear missiles could be kept in reserve in Asia. The current U.S. draft treaty also allows for 100 missiles to be taken to Asia.    Mr. Weinberger argues that the U.S. should get as many concessions as it can, while it can. He reasons that the Soviets are negotiating in earnest today because they badly want to rid Western Europe of U.S. Pershing missiles, which can reach the Soviet Union in minutes. Arguing that the U.S. should make maximum use of that leverage, he said: &quot;I don't see why we should give up on a better proposal because at one time we discussed something else.&quot;    George Younger, Britain's defense minister, also backs the total elimination of the Soviet medium-range missiles. &quot;This has so many advantages,&quot; he said. &quot;It makes for easier verification, and you close down a production line.&quot;    Other European officials also say they prefer the full elimination of the weapons, since the missiles could be transported back to Eastern Europe during a crisis. The Japanese, Chinese and South Koreans also have indicated that they are cool to an arms agreement that appears to improve Europe's security at Asia's expense.    The Soviets could gain from the Weinberger plan in one respect: It likely would free them of U.S. demands for the right to inspect Soviet arms factories to assure full compliance with the treaty. Assuring compliance with the full elimination of the missiles is far simpler, U.S. officials say.    U.S. officials also took pains to assure Europeans at the meeting that the pending U.S.-Soviet arms agreement isn't part of an effort to banish all nuclear weapons from Europe. A NATO committee chaired by Assistant Defense Secretary Frank Gaffney presented a report that suggested a range of options for new weapons, including a number of nuclear ones, that would be added after the current batch is hauled out. The weapons discussed included an improved version of the Lance nuclear missile and more submarine-launched cruise missiles.    Mr. Weinberger described the meetings as a &quot;consultation process.&quot; He added that it's too soon to say what NATO will do to compensate for the firepower it would lose under the proposed treaty. &quot;There's a feeling that if you take out these systems, there are some benefits and some detriments,&quot; he said. &quot;It presents a new set of equations, a new calculus for what is needed.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
