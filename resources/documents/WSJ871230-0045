But now scientists are telling everybody to wait a second.    It seems we have an astronomical problem on our hands: The world isn't turning quite as fast as it used to.    Dennis McCarthy, chief of the U.S. Naval Observatory's Earth Orientation Parameters Division here, says the Earth's spin has been slowing for millions of years. Because of the moon's tug on the oceans, atmospheric friction and other effects, our day is perhaps two hours longer than the one experienced by a pterodactyl 150 million years ago.    The change was so gradual that pterodactyls, and, later, milleniums of humans, didn't notice it. But in 1948, a British scientist built the first atomic clock, and timekeeping hasn't been the same since.    Atomic time, now based primarily on the vibrations of electrons in cesium atoms, is accurate to within about a billionth of a second each day. Because it is oblivious to the earth's sluggishness, it eventually runs ahead of the Earth's rotation time. After a year or two, says the Naval Observatory's Mr. McCarthy, atomic time is out of synch with the Earth by maybe a whole second.    For a ship or missile guided by the wrong time signal, that little gap could mean arriving at the wrong destination. &quot;If we let the difference grow,&quot; says Mr. McCarthy, &quot;we could run into problems over thousands of years. It might be noon by atomic time, but dark outside.&quot;    The Naval Observatory is the nation's official timekeeper. As part of a world-wide 1972 agreement that keeps the Earth and atomic clocks synchronized, the observatory has ordered an extra second into our lives tomorrow.    This leap second, the 14th since the practice began, will delay midnight by exactly one second in Greenwich, England. At the same instant -- 6:59:60, Eastern Standard Time -- the Naval Observatory will add a 61st second for the U.S.    Though they may not notice, many New Yorkers will celebrate the leap second at midnight. The crowd that gathers at Times Square tomorrow night to watch the Big Apple ball drop will see, at the end of its descent, a one-second light show before 1988 officially arrives.    Mr. McCarthy, meanwhile, says he won't bother to add a second to his own timepiece. &quot;My watch isn't that accurate,&quot; he says. &quot;I lose a minute every couple of weeks anyway.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
