Webb Posts$65.7 Million LossFor Third Quarter</HL><DD> 11/02/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> WBBEARNINGS (ERN) </IN><DATELINE> PHOENIX, Ariz.  </DATELINE><TEXT>    Del E. Webb Corp. reported athird-quarter net loss of $65.7 million, compared with ayear-earlier profit, although it said the loss reflected netwrite-downs and loss reserves totaling $71.5 million.   The developer of retirement communities, real estate and gambling properties said the deficit in the latest quarter included a loss from discontinued operations of $2.2 million and a $1.1 million extraordinary loss on an exchange of common stock for subordinated notes. Webb had net income in the 1986 quarter of $7 million, or 86 cents a share.    Revenue slipped 1.4% to $83.9 million from $85.1 million.    Webb said $69 million of the write-downs and loss reserves relate to its Claridge casino-hotel, in Atlantic City, N.J., with the rest relating to 536 acres of undeveloped Fort Collins, Colo., land. The company previously had said it expected write-downs from its gambling properties over the full year of &quot;substantially more&quot; than $60 million.    Robert K. Swanson, chairman, said the Claridge-related items represent a write-down of a $42.2 million second mortgage and other assets, and loss reserves relating to future obligations to provide working capital to the Claridge.    Without the one-time charges, Webb said, it would have had net income in the latest quarter of $5.8 million, or 69 cents a share.    Webb reiterated that it believes fourth-quarter earnings could be cut about $27 million. Of that amount, $20 million would relate to tax-accounting changes and $7 million to Webb's assumption of liabilities and transaction costs if it succeeds in its offers to acquire rights to repurchase three Nevada casino-hotels it manages.    John A. Spencer, vice president and controller, said the company is continuing to study a possible restructuring and divestures. He said that operations &quot;in the broadest sense&quot; were being reviewed for possible sale and that decisions about a strategy could be reached &quot;in the near future.&quot; Webb hasn't identified which operations it might sell.    For the nine months, Webb had a net loss of $55.8 million, compared with year-before net income of $16.3 million, or $1.97 a share. Revenue fell 2.5%, to $205.1 million from $210.4 million. Net income in the latest nine months included a $3.2 million loss from discontinued operations and the $1.1 million loss related to the exchange of stock. </TEXT></DOC>
