The proposal establishes ``Y'' accounts to processcorrespondent trades and establishes a fee schedule for such accounts.Notice of the proposal was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on November 3, 1988.\1\<NOTE/> No comments were received. This order approves the proposal.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26223 (October 28, 1988),53 FR 44544. <ITAG tagnum="84">I. MCC's Description of the Proposal</ITAG>MCC states in its filing that it has established a special secondary account,known as ``Y'' account, to facilitate additional recording, clearance,and settlement of securities transactions. MCC states that the purposeof the ``Y'' account will be to process correspondent market activity,<T3>i.e.</T3>, trades that are executed in the account of one MCC participantand sent to the account of another MCC participant for settlement.\2\<NOTE/> MCC states that ``Y'' accounts will improve MCC's operatingefficiency by permitting automation of flip trades, which previously havebeen processed manually.\3\<NOTE/> The proposal also will establish a maintenance fee of $125for the first ``Y'' account requested by a participant and $10 for eachsubsequent account. A separate ``Y'' account will be required for eachcorrespondent customer. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Such a trade also is known as a ``flip trade'' in thatthe trade: (1) Is executed and compared in the account of one participant,and (2) then ``flipped'' for settlement to the account of another participantthat guarantees the account on behalf of the initial participant. Suchtrades typically are used by MCC participants that have a correspondentrelationship with each other. Telephone conversation between Jeffrey E.Lewis, Associate Counsel, MCC, and Thomas C. Etter, Jr., Attorney, Securitiesand Exchange Commission, December 6, 1988. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ <T3>Id., </T3>December 14, 1988. MCC estimated the volume of these tradesas small, with less than 20 correspondent accounts and less than 10 participantsinvolved. <T3>Id</T3>. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. MCC's Rationale for the Proposal</ITAG>MCC states that this secondary account and its maintenance fee scheduleare consistent with section 17A of the Act in that: (1) The new accountswill permit automation and thereby promote the prompt and accurate clearanceand settlement of securities transactions; and (2) the fee schedules willprovide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and othercharges among MCC's participants. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Discussion</ITAG>The Commission believes that the rule proposal is consistent with the Act.The proposal would permit MCC to automate its correspondent market activityand to impose service fees. This concept is not a matter of first impressionfor the Commission inasmuch as the Commisson has approved other rules authorizingspecial accounts and fee schedules for processing flip trades, and suchaccounts currently are being used in the securities industry.\4\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ <T3>See</T3>, <T3>e.g</T3>., Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26040 (August 29, 1988),53 FR 33567, concerning National Securities Clearance Corporation's feesfor processing flip trades.  The Commission believes that the main benefit of this proposal will bethe use of automation by MCC in processing flip trades, which will increaseefficiency and reduce costs in an area where transactions previously wereprocessed manually. The Commission believes that other benefits of theproposal will include improvements in: (1) MCC's accounting techniques,in that the proposal requires maintenance of an individual account foreach correspondent customer of each participant; and (2) MCC's abilityto view activity in MCC member omnibus accounts.\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Studies of the October 1987 Market Break recommended thatclearing agencies improve their ability to identify their marketplace risksand to see through their participants to the accounts of their customers.<T3>See, e.g., </T3>Division of Market Regulation, Securities and ExchangeCommission, <T3>The October 1987 Market Break </T3>at 10-22 (1988).  The Commission notes that section 17A of the Act expressly encourages effortsto make securities processing more efficient by the use of automation.Moreover, the Commission believes that MCC's proposed fee schedule forparticipants using these special secondary accounts is consistent withsection 17A(b)(3)(D) of the Act in that it provides for equitable allocationof dues, fees, and other charges among its participants. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Conclusion </ITAG>For the reasons discused in this order, the Commission finds that the proposalis consistent with the requirements of the Act, particularly section 17Aof the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. <T3>It is therefore ordered, </T3>Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,that the above-mentioned proposed rule change (SR-MCC-88-09) be, and herebyis, approved.<ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuantto delegated authority. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: December 28, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
