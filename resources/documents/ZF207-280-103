 You haven't seen that dreaded message since you bought a40-megabyte hard-disk drive two years ago.andP;  No -- it couldn't possibly be!andM;Could it?andM;A quick check with the Finder confirms your frenzied panic: Your hard diskhas runneth over; its tank is topped off; it has posted the ultimate &quot;NoVacancy&quot; sign in the Lost Land of Mammoth Megabytes.andM;Time to buy another hard-disk drive?andP;  Whoa there.andP;  Think twice before youtake the plunge.andP;  If you managed to top off one hard-disk drive, you'relikely to fill another, then another, and another....andM;Wouldn't it be nice if you could just eject the full disk an pop in a fresh,blank one?andP;  That's exactly the idea behind the removable mass-storage drive.andO;You needn't be a data glutton to appreciate removable mass storage.andP;  You mayshare gobs of computer-aided design or spreadsheet data with coworkers orclients, and instead of shipping a horde of floppy disks around the country,you can trade one compact and easily transplanted high-capacity diskandM;You'll also appreciate removable mass storage if you deal in sensitive data,like plans for the Stealth Bomber--stuff you don't want falling into anyoneelse's hands.andP;  Or if you need a quick and effective way to back up one ormore fixed (nonremovable) hard-disk drives.andM;MacUser Labs subjected 17 removable mass-storage drives to exhaustive andcomprehensive tests.andP;  (The removable mass storage we're extolling here is therandom-access, fully recordable and erasable kind.andP;  It doesn't includestreaming tape, CD-ROM, or write-once, read-many (WORM) drives.)andP;  Though manyof the models share common traits and specifications, there are marked andunexpected differencesandM;What's more, removable mass-storage drives use three distinct technologies,and each has its pros and cons.andP;  You must first choose a technology, and thendecide on the best model in that group.andP;  You'll want to weigh all the factorscarefully before making an investment.andM;DUELING FORMATSandM;At a very basic level, a removable mass-storage drive is like a hard-diskdrive but with one important difference: You can remove and replace themagnetic recording disk.andP;  The catch is that some removable mass-storagedrives use flexible disks instead of &quot;hard&quot; ones, and others are engineeredso that you remove the entire drive mechanism from a central chassis unit.andO;Removable mass-storage drives use three basic technologies to pack portablemegabytes:andM;* High-capacity flexible drives use a floppy disk enclosed in a vinyl orhardplastic shell.andP;  They're similar to the floppy-disk drive alreadyinstalled in you Mac, but the recording medium is bigger and the disk holdsat least 12 times as much data.andM;* Removable hard-cartridge drives are themost like conventional hard-diskdrives but with a twist.andP;  Press a button, and the hard-disk platter ejectsfrom the drive.andP;  The platter is enclosed in a hard-plastic cartridge forprotection.andM;* Removable hard-disk drives use self-contained, modular hard-disk mechanismsthat can be removed from a host chassis.andP;  The chassis contains the controllerelectronics (which communicate with the Macintosh) and a power supply.andM;A fourth pseudoremovable mass-storage drive is the compact, shockmountedmodel.andP;  These are orthodox, hard-disk drives that--because of their smallsize and weight--offer many of the same advantages and capabilities asremovable mass storage.andP;  We've dubbed these units totables.andP;  For moreinformation about these diminutive drivettes, see sidebar, &quot;Totable Hard-DiskDrives.&quot;andM;WHAT GOES ON INSIDEandM;Regardless of the actual system used to implement removable high-capacitydata storage, the 17 contenders in this Lab Report conform to the same basicdata-recording techniques shared by all computer disk drives.andM;A disk, coated with a magnetically sensitive layer, spins at high speedinside the drive.andP;  A magnetic pickup head, similar to the recording heads ina tape deck but much smaller, contacts or hovers over the disk medium as itspins.andP;  Data is ecorded in discrete circular traks, and each track is furtherdivided into sectors.andP;  By partitioning the disk into distinct track andsector domains, the Macintosh is able to store and retrieve data moreefficiently.andP;  Note that each concentric track begins and ends at the sameplace; the read/write head does not record a single, long track that spiralsfrom the outside of the disk to the inside like a phonograph record.andM;Conventionally hard-disk drives for the Macintosh and other computers oftenuse more than one recording disk to store large amounts of data.andP;  Except forthe Bernoulli Box II/20 and the removable hard-disk drives, the modelsdetailed in the following pages use a single disk.andP;  This disk may be single-or double-sided; when double-sided, the drive has two read/write heads, eachpositioned on one side of the disk.andM;HIGH-CAPACITY FLEXIBLE DRIVESandM;Can a floppy disk really hold 20 megabytes or more of data?andP;  You bet.andP;  TheMac's floppy-disk drive uses a stepper motor to inch the read/write head overthe surface of the disk.andP;  Though stepper motors are reasonably accurate, theymove only in discrete steps: finite increments that limit the number ofrecordable tracks.andP;  The fewer the tracks, the lower the capacity.andO;High-capacity flexible drives use a sophisticated closed-loop servo system toposition the read/write head accurately over the surface of the disk.andP;  Thehead is mounted on a voice-coil actuator that can position the head anywherealong the radius of the disk.andP;  High-frequency servo signals are recorded by aprecision formatter at the factory when the disk is made.andP;  This ensures thatthe head stops directly on each track.andM;Without these servo signals, which are not erased even when the disk isreinitialized, the drive won't work.andP;  That's why you should never use a bulkeraser on a high-capacity flexible disk.andP;  The process will destroy it.andP;  Thiswarning applies to all the high-capacity-drive media discussed in this reportbecause all of them use closed-loop servo systems.andM;The high-capacity flexible drive category is actually composed of twotechnologies: Bernoulli and high-density floppy.andP;  Let's look closely at eachone.andM;BERNOULLI DRIVERSandM;Bernoulli drives use an 8- or 5.25-inch flexible disk enclosed in ahard-plastic cartridge.andP;  The cartridge slips into the drive like anaudiocassette into a car's tape player.andP;  Once the cartridges is inside thedrive, its protective doors open and reveal the disk.andM;Bernoulli drives derive their name from Daniel Bernoulli (1700-1782), a Swissphysicist who developed a complex aerodynamic principle involving fluidpressures and velocities.andP;  Very simply put, the Bernoulli principle statesthat when the velocity of a fluid (including air) increases, its pressuredecreases.andP;  It is the Bernoulli principle that accounts for the ability of anairplane to fly.andM;The flexible disk in a Bernoulli drive spins at 1,500 to 1,800 rpm, dependingon the drive type (traditional hard-disk drives spin at 3,600 rpm).andP;  Thisspinning induces a stream of air to move over the surface of the disk.andP;  Asthat air passes over the tiny magnetic read/write head, the air moleculesspeed up slightly (just as air speeds up when it passes over the top of anairplan wing).andP;  According to the Bernoulli principle, air pressure thereforedecreases, and the disk is drawn to -- but does not touch -- the magnetichead.andM;The disk flexes slightly as it passes over the head, which contributes tosome wear of the media over time.andP;  Most Bernoulli drive manufacturersestimate media life of five years, a reasonably long period considering theinconstancy of computer data.andM;Though it is separated from the disk by a distance of less than 10 millionthsof an inch, the head still becomes dirty after several dozen hours of use andrequires a thorough cleaning.andP;  Most Bernoulli drives come with cleaning kits.andO;The biggest selling point of Bernoulli drives is their relative immunity tohead crashes.andP;  A crash occurs in hard-disk drives when the magnetic headtouches the delicate surface of the disk.andP;  In a Bernoulli drive, air pressureprevents the head from touching the disk.andP;  Even if the drive is turned offand the disk comes to a stop, the media floats away from the head as the liftpressures are relieved.andM;The champion of Bernoulli mass storage is Iomega, holder of theBernoulli-drive patents.andP;  It currently offers three drives:andM;* The original Bernoulli Box, designed for 8-inch media that can store either10 or 20 megabytes.andM;* The Bernoulli Box II/20, engineered for 5.25-inch media and capable of a20-megabyte reserve on its two cartridge-encased disks.andM;* The Bernoulli Box II/44, which has 5.25-inch media and a 44-megabytestorage capacity.andP;  We tested a preproduction unit, and it looked verypromising.andM;Other Bernoulli models are the Super,ac Technology XP 60+B, a combination60-megabyte fixed and 20-megabyte Bernoulli removable drive, and the BeringIndustries Totem, with a 20-megabyte capacity.andP;  Both the SuperMac and theBering use disks compatible with the Bernoulli Box II/20.andM;Users of Bernoullis maintain an almost fanatical devotion to their drives,and they eagerly jump to the defense at the first sign of adverse comment.andO;Nevertheless, we found that the Bernoulli drives were among the slowest andmost expensive in the Crowd.andP;  In our Macintosh SE DiskBasher tests, all theBernoulli drives we evaluated ranked 50 to 200 percent slower than competingremovable hard-cartridge or removable hard-disk drives.andP;  Much of thisslowness can be attributed to the disk speed of 1,500 to 1,800 rpm.andP;  The slowrotation limits disk performance; after all, the head can retrieve data onlyas fast as the disk can shuttle it by.andM;As an example of performance, the Bernoulli II/20 had a MacUser LabsDiskBasher benchmark speed of 96.6 seconds on the SE.andP;  The Mass MicrosystemsDataPak, typical of the removable hard-cartridge units, boasted a speed ofjust 45.2 seconds, more than 50 percent faster.andM;If Bernoulli technology is somewhat slower than that of rival systems (andnew II/44 driver software speeds performance considerably), its reliabilityis unmatched.andP;  Yes, the flexible media in Bernoulli drives eventually wearout, but head crashes are infrequent to nonexistent.andP;  You can alwaysanticipate the wear of a Bernoulli cartridge in time to replace it withanother.andP;  But you never know when the next head crash will occur.andP;  For thisreason alone, the Bernoulli drives are worthy of your consideration.andM;HIGH-DENSITY FLOPPIESandM;High-density floppy-disk drives pack more data in a given area than regularfloppy-disk drives, thanks to their voice-coil-actuated read/write heads,precise closed-servo feedback system, and data-compression techniques.andO;Rather than use the 3.5-inch media familiar to Mac users, high-densityfloppy-disk drives embrace the older but larger 5.25-inch format.andM;We reviewed two disparate high-density floppy-disk drive systems.andP;  Onesystem, marketed by Jasmine and Mirror Technologies and developed in part bymagnetic-media giant Verbatim, uses a 5.25-inch floppy disk packed inside ahard-plastic cartridge.andP;  Data capacity is a respectable 20 megabytes.andP;  Themagnetic head touches the media, which spins at 600 rpm -- roughly twice asfast as ordinary floppy disks.andP;  To prevent excessive wear on any one portionof the disk, the drive forces the head to roam over the surface of the mediawhen not actually logging or fetching data.andM;Peripheral Land offers a high-capacity floppy-disk drive, the Infinity 10,that uses a flexible-vinyl outer jacket instead of a hard-plastic one.andP;  Thedisk looks exactly like the 5.25-inch floppy you'd use in an Apple II or IBMPC, but it holds 10 megabytes of Mac data.andP;  How?andP;  As with the otherhigh-capacity floppy-disk drives, servo signals -- previously recorded on thedisk at the factory -- are used to position the head accurately.andM;Because the Infinity 10 can accept regular 5.25-inch floppies, its dualpersonality allows it to read data recorded on IBM PC or PC/AT disks.andP;  Alas,it can't record data in PC format.andM;REMOVALE HARD CARTRIDGESandM;Despite warnings of doom by competing manufacturers, the removablehard-cartridge, high-capacity drive has become the most popular of the bunch.andO;Its engineering is deceptively simple but superbly workable: a rigid metalplatter, coated with magnetic gunk, permanently housed in a clear,hard-plastic cartridge.andP;  The 44-megabyte cartridge plugs into the drivemechanism, which includes one pair of read/write heads.andM;The recording platter in the cartridge is precision-polished aluminum, coatedwith layers of thin-film metal alloys for improved data capacity and materialhardness.andP;  Over the thin-film coatings is a protective overcoat and a sheathof synthetic lubricant.andP;  The lubricant serves two purposes: to preventserious damage if the heads should ever touch the surface of the disk and toprevent foreign matter from sticking to the surface of the media.andM;As in a regular hard-disk drive, the read/write head is levitated by acushion of air above the 3,200-rpm spinning disk.andP;  The clearance, or flyingheight, between head and disk is exceptionally small, on the order of sevento nine millionts of an inch -- just a fraction of the width of a human hair.andO;The cushion of air normally prevents the head from touching the disk, but thecushion is lost when the disk stops spinning or when the drive is subjectedto energetic movement.andP;  Removable hard-cartridge models are as susceptible tohead crashes as ordinary fixed hard-disk drives, so they deserve the samecare and consideration.andM;Removable hard-cartridge drives employ a locking system to prevent the headsfrom gouging into the disk when the cartridge is removed and inserted.andP;  Whenthe drive is empty or turned off, the heads normally rest on a plastic wedge,located off to one corner.andP;  After the drive is turned on and a disk isinserted, the heads are nudged off the wedge and gently float over thesurface of the spinning media.andP;  The drives also employ an automatic parkingand locking system that is activated when the disk is ejected or when poweris suddenly lost.andM;The removable hard-cartridge drive market is monopolized by Syquest, themanufacturer of both the disk cartridges and the drive units.andP;  Othermanufacturers buy the raw components from Syquest and build them intocomplete drives.andP;  That's why the removable hard-cartridge drives weinvestigated proved to be virtual clones of one another.andP;  Except for detailslike price, driver software, packaging, operating manuals, and warranties,the drives are identical.andM;Our performance tests reveal this graphically: For the six removablehard-cartridge drives we looked at -- the Peripheral Land Infinity 40 Turbo,the Mass Microsystems DataPak, the Relax Technology Mobile 42 Plus, the DPI44 Removable, the Bay Microsystems 44RepackRemovable, and the InfoTechnologies Info 42R -- the benchmark results were consistently within a fewpercent of one another.andM;The performance of the six removable hard-cartridge models was constant amongall the drives we looked at, with average SE Disk Basher benchmark times ofabout 46 seconds.andP;  Internal hardware caching (see sidebar, &quot;RemovableHard-Cartridge Systems&quot;) contributes much to the pleasing performance ofthese drives.andP;  The 8K cache also permits the drive to be formatted at anefficient 1:1 interleave, even if you own a Mac Plus or SE.andP;  If removablehard-cartridge drives offer so much performance and flexibility, why havethey received bad publicity?andM;Dirt.andM;Not political dirt, but microscopic dirt that can contaminate the surface ofthe disk and causes a serious head crash.andP;  Fixed hard-disk drives are eithersealed completely from the outside air or are buffered from it by a heavypaper filter.andP;  These methods of isolation prevent dust, dirt, and othercontaminants from reaching the hard dis itself.andP;  In the microscopic world ofmagnetic read/write heads, remember, a particle of smoke from a cigarette islike a boulder on the Interstate.andM;Removable hard-cartridge drivers rely on a blast of air circulating over thespinning disk and positive air pressure to clear away foreign matter.andO;Because of the construction of the drive and cartridges, the incomingairstream is only moderately filtered before the disk is exposed to it.andO;During our tests with the six drives, we experienced one disk failure -- andwe aren't certain of its cause.andP;  Members of the MacUser Labs team whopersonally use removable hard cartridges with their own Macs report nottrouble.andP;  So while the threat is there, we could find no hard proof of itsconsequences.andM;REMOVABLE HARD-DISK DRIVESandM;If you prize the advantages of removable mass storage but are leery of thesnags imposed by other take-along systems, then removable hard-disk drivesmay be what you're looking for.andP;  Removable hard-disk drives are composed oftwo parts: a sealed module that houses the disk and read/write headmechanism, and a chassis containing the power supply.andM;The module docks into the chassis during normal use, automatically completingthe necessary electrical and power connections to operate the drive.andP;  Toremove the module, just yank it out of the chassis.andP;  You expand the availablememory by purshasing additional disk modules.andP;  With high-capacity flexibleand removable hard-cartridge systems, the cost of the media is only a smallpercentage of the cost of the drive.andP;  But the main expense of a removablehard disk is the disk module itself.andP;  That makes these drives far moreexpensive to expand than the other systems we looked at.andM;Removable hard-disk drives may represent the most expensive solution toportable mass storage, but they offer a number of worthwhile benefits.andO;Because the disk is sealed inside a solid module, it isn't as susceptible todamage caused by handling and dirt.andP;  Removable hard-disk drives are alsofast, competing in performance with the best fixed hard-disk drives for theMacintosh.andP;  They also feature high capacities.andP;  Models are available with upto 120 megabytes of storage space.andM;And to some, expandable mass storage itself is less important than thesecurity of the data.andP;  Both the MegaDrive Disk Pack P84 and ProStor TransPacdrives provide at least a rudimentary key-lock systems as well as securitysoftware to prevent theft or unauthorized use.andP;  The Mass Microsystems UniPakcomes with password-security software but lacks a key lock.andM;MAKING THE CHOICEandM;Which high-capacity mass-storage drive is for you?andP;  Before you commit andsign that check, consider price, expansion cost, performance, reliability,and portability.andM;PRICEandM;Of the models we tested and detailed in Table 1, &quot;Main Summary of Features,&quot;retail list price varied from a high of $3,495 for the SuperMac XP 60+B (acombination fixed and removable drive) to a low of $899 for the MirrorTechnologies RM20.andP;  Average price is about $1,800 -- that correlates to thetypical cost of a removable hard-cartridge drive.andP;  These prices are foreither single- or double-drive models, as noted, and include at least oneblank disk.andM;On the whole, removable mass-storage drives cost 20 to 40 percent more thanfixed SCSI hard-disk drives with comparable capacity.andP;  Keep that in mind.andM;EXPANSION COSTandM;Removable mass storage assumes you want to add more capacity later on.andO;Ponder the expense of additional disks to expand your memory, and considerthe cost of the disk in relation to its capacity.andP;  That gives you a roughidea of the cost of long-term ownership.andP;  It's similar to judging the overallcost of a car by adding in its annual fuel costs.andM;For example, 25 bucks buys one 10-megabyte disk for the Infinity 10; that's acost of $2.50 per megabyte.andP;  All in all, not a bad deal.andP;  The 44-megabytemedia for removable hard-cartridge drives cost around $125.andP;  That equates toa per-megabyte cost of about $2.85.andP;  The 20-megabyte cartridges for theBermoulli Box II/20 are among the most expensive: $4.20 per megabyte.andM;Removable hard-disk drives represent the most exorbitant means of storageexpansion.andP;  Additional modules cost on the order of $1,000 -- roughly $25 permegabyte (assuming a 40-megabyte disk capacity).andM;PERFORMANCEandM;MacUser Labs performed numerous tests to determine the overall performance ofeach drive.andP;  Disk Basher our main benchmark, performs a sequence of reads andwrites using the highest level of Macintosh hierarchical file system.andP;  Itclosely duplicates the disk-drive access of an application program butwithout tying up CPU time.andP;  The results, as shown in the benchmarks (Table1), are shown in seconds.andP;  The lower the number, the better.andP;  Results areprovided for both the SE (test machine equipped with 1 megabyte of RAM) andthe Mac II (with 5 megabytes of RAM).andM;The winners?andP;  We discover that the technology of the drive contributed mostto its overall performance.andP;  The modular removable hard-disk drives won theDiskBasher performance race, with SE times under a respectable 40 seconds.andO;These results compare favorably with or even exceed those of nonremovableharddisk drives for the Macintosh.andP;  Removable hard cartridges placed a closesecond, with SE times ranging from 45.2 seconds (Mass Microsystems DataPak)to 48.8 seconds (DPI 44 Removable).andP;  The high-density floppy and Bernoullidrives placed third, with speeds as slow as 236 seconds.andM;RELIABILITYandM;Reliability is not an easy test for you or the MacUser Labs to perform; itconsists of much more than mere torture-testing of a drive or ad hocdetermination of whether it's a piece of junk.andP;  Rather, you should considerthe reputation of the company, the dependability of the media againstaccidental damage (a real possibility given the portability of the disks),and after-sales support.andM;PORTABILITYandM;The smaller the disk, the easier it is to carry with you or to mail acrossthe country.andP;  The flat high-density floppy disks used by the JasmineMegaDrive 20, the Mirror Technologies RM20, and the Peripheral Land Infinity10 are perhaps the most portable of the bunch, and they seem the least liableto be damaged by crushing or dropping.andP;  They're lightweight, and they'resmall enough to carry around in a briefcase or to fit into any 5.25-inch diskmailer.andP;  The 5.25-inch disks for the Iomega Bernoulli Box II/20 and theremovable hard cartridges can be readily shipped by UPS, Federal Express, orU.S.andP;  Mail, and they stow easily in a briefcase or portfolio.andP;  Removable hardcartridges come in their own plastic storage cases, which afford someprotection against accidental drops and the ravages of the environment.andM;But beware: Removable hard cartridges can be seriously damaged if dropped.andO;One hard cartridge fell 3 feet to the lineleum MacUser Labs floor andsuffered a crack in one corner.andP;  Impressively, the disk still functionedafter the drop, but if this happens to you, back it up immediately.andP;  There'sno telling how long dropped media will last, even if it is never againsubjected to abuse.andM;The least portable and most fragile media are the 8-inch Bernoulli Boxcartridge and the modules designed to fit inside the chasis of a removableharddisk drive.andM;OTHER CRITERIAandM;You may also want to consider these criteria in selecting a suitableremovable mass-storage drive:andM;* Sharing data with others.andP;  Get the type of drive used by friends,associates, and clients so you can readily trade data.andP;  Media for removablehard-cartridge drives are interchangeable among other Syquest-based makes andmodels, making them the most versatile.andM;* Using the drive for making backups.andP;  To be effective in making backups, theremovable drive should have a capacity roughly equal to that of your fixeddrived.andP;  Or be sure the drive comes with a backup program that enables you todivide the contents of the fixed drive over two or more high-capacity disks.andM;* Fitting a removable drive on your desk.andP;  Unlike a fixed hard-disk drive,which can be implanted in a Mac II or turcked out of the way, a removablemass-storage drive must be easily accessible.andP;  Choose a drive that fitscomfortably on your desk and allows easy insertion and removal of the disk.andM;JUDGING FOR YOURSELFandM;The MacUser Labs test results paint an accurate and objective picture of theperformance of removable mass-storage drives.andP;  We tested each drive with botha Macintosh SE and a II.andP;  In some cases, you'll note an unusual disparitybetween the test results.andM;This is primarily caused by how drivers and controllers interact with revisedMac SCSI software.andP;  Obviously, you'll want to consider the best drive foryour needs based on the type of Macintosh you own.andP;  If you have a Mac Plus,follow the test results given for the Mac SE.andP;  But add a few points tocompensate for the slower speed of the Plus.andM;Equipped with a removable mass-storage drive, you can now dare your Mac todisplay its insidious &quot;Disk full&quot; message--and live to tell the tale.andM;Capsule ReviewsandM;High-CapacityandM;Flexible DrivesandM;Infinity 10andM;A 10-megabyte 5.25-inch floppy-disk drive.andP;  Can also read both 360K and1.2-megabyte IBM disks.andP;

 Essentiallythe same drive engine is sold by a number of companies, so you get toconcentrate on what might be most important to you: the price.andP;  Half a dozencompanies buying from the same manufacturer have driven prices low.andO;Nonetheless, there are differences between the systems.andM;What distinguishes one Syquest drive from another?andP;  Well, packaging for onething.andP;  The Mass Microsystems unit has a nice ergonomic tilt that angles thescreen of an SE more into your line of sight.andP;  DPI's drive chassis has avertical mounting that looks good and fits nicely next to a Mac II.andP;  On theback of its model, Relax Technology has put additional AC plugs that areswitched from the front.andP;  Each manufacturer builds in its own power supply.andO;All the models reviewed use switching power supplies, and all have some formof surge and noise suppression.andP;  If the warranty is good, the power supplyshouldn't be a major consideration.andM;The drivers appeared outwardly similar, and when test results came in, theirperformance was pretty much the same.andP;  Peripheral Land deserves mention forits caching scheme, which speeds data transfer considerably.andP;  But do youreally trust a &quot;write&quot; cache where data to be written to the drive isactually stored in memory?andP;  Remember, if you lose power, you'll wave goodbyeto that data.andM;Mass Microsystems includes Padlok software that performs encryption,formatting, partitioning, and password protection.andP;  Relax Technology includesa backup program, a formatter, and a desk accessory that lets you mount a newcartridge.andP;  DPI gives you a formatter -- and not much else -- while BayMicrosystems gives you FWB Software's Hard Disk Utilities and a formatter.andO;Info Technologies does Bay Microsystems one better and offers all of FWBSoftware's programs, including a formatter.andM;After all is said and done, you may well ask if all the Syquest drives areequal.andP;  The answer is yes, basically.andP;  Therefore it seems that price,reputation, warrantly, and the bundled software package should influence yourdecision.andP;  The most important of these considerations is probably price,closely followed by the vendor's reputation for service and support.andP;  Whileall the companies are relative newcomers, Relax and Peripheral Land have beenin business the longest and that might give them the edge.andP;  However, sincethe guts of all these drives are basically the same, why not take a chancewith a newcomer?andP;  We don't have a problem recommending any of these systems,and until magneto-optical (or something better) becomes a standard, we'll beusing these as our removable medium.andM;Of Drivers and ControllersandM;Macintosh disk drives -- all kinds, removable and nonremovable -- arevirtually headache and hassle free, thanks to standardization in hardware andsoftware.andP;  The typical Mac hard-disk drive is composed of three hardwarecomponents:andM;* The hard-disk mechanism itself, with disk platter, read/write heads, andmotor.andM;* Controller electronics that provide both on-board smarts for the diskmechanism and a reliable connection to the Macintosh.andM;* A power supply to provide operating juice for the disk mechanism andelectronics.andM;Controllers for MAc hard drives use a small computer system interface (SCSI)to connect the drive to the computer.andP;  The Mac has a matching SCSI interface;all you need is the right cable to connect the two.andP;  Mac hard drives use twotypes of SCSI connectors, one with 25 pins and another with 50.andP;  If you harddisk doesn't come with a cable or if you need to get an extra, be sure youbuy a cable with the proper drive connector.andP;  SCSI devices must also beproperly terminated.andM;The SCSI port provides hardware commonality, so the only worry whenphysically installing a hard disk is identifying the particular address ofthe drive.andP;  The Macintosh supports seven SCSI devices, all daisy-chained tothe connector on the back of the computer.andP;  The Mac differentiates betweenSCSI devices by using a numbering system from 0 to 7 (with the Mac itself asdevice 7).andM;The majority of removable mass-storage drives we looked at provided an easyway to change the SCSI address, though some -- like the Mass MicrosystemsUniPak -- required altering a set of soldered jumpers on the controllerboard.andP;  Ouch.andM;The Macintosh SE and the Mac II have almost identical SCSI ports.andP;  The Mac IIhas a faster clok and dynamic bus sizing; both features allow data to bepassed between drive and computer more quickly.andP;  This higher transfer rate isone reason why hard drives perform better on a Mac II.andM;The Mac Plus SCSI port is slightly handicapped: It lacks some physicalconnections to the outside world (the buzzwords are &quot;hardware handshaking&quot;).andO;The computer must make up for this by substituting software workarounds forthese hardware connections.andP;  This lowers the SCSI transfer rate on the MacPlus considerably.andM;The SCSI port exchanges data between drive and computer using either blind orpolled transfers.andP;  In a polled transfer, the Macintosh waits for confirmationthat data has been properly sent or received.andP;  Blind transfers dispose of thedelay imposed by data confirmation; they send bits as fast as they can befunneled through the system.andP;  Apple claims the following transfer rates forits three Macintosh models:andM;Supporting the SCSI interlink between drive and computer is a softwaredriver, an &quot;invisible&quot; program that tells the Macintosh how to use thehard-disk drive mechanism.andP;  Each manufacturer puts a driver on the hard disk,and the Mac loads this driver into memory when the computer is started.andP;  Mostoften, failure in a hard disk is the result of a damaged or erased driver; ifyou're lucky, fixing it is usually as simple as rewriting the driver usingthe original utility disk supplied with the drive.andP;  Be careful not toreinitialize if you'd like to keep your data.andM;Though drivers for removable mass storage are written to accomplish the sameends, they are nonetheless seldom alike among drive manufacturers.andP;  Driverscontribute to the overall integrity, speed, and reliability of a disk drive.andO;Though two hard drives may be physically identical, different drivers canresult in wide variations in performance.andP;  This is readily apparent in theremovable hard-cartridge drives, all of which are based on hardware made bySyquest.andP;  The benchmark tests differ (though only moderately) mainly becauseof variations in software drivers.andM;Removable Hard-Disk DrivesandM;UniPakandM;Comes in three sizes: 48, 84, and 102 megabytes, with higher-capacity unitson the way.andP;  Nice interface makes it as easy to use as a floppy-disk drive.andO;Unit looks remarkably similar to ProStor's.andP;  Pros: Very fast.andP;  24-hourtechnical support.andP;  Cons: Units tested had no read/write activity light andno external SCSI ID switch.andP;  Formatting was very slow because of extensiveverification.andP;  Mass Microsystems assures us that these deficiencies will beaddressed in future models.andP;  Mass Microsystems, Inc.andP;  550 Del Rey Ave.andO;Sunnyvale, CA 94086-3528 (408) 522-1200 Chassis, $600 Disk pack, $2,600 (102megabytes)andM;TransPacandM;Looks just like Mass Microsystems' UniPak but features Quantum hard drive and64K cache controller board; therefore it outperforms UniPak.andP;  Pros: Fasterthan UniPak.andP;  Optional removable key lock prevents disk-pack removal.andP;  Cons:Documentation virtually nonexistent.andP;  Technical support not much better.andO;Difficult to set SCSI ID.andP;  ProStor, Inc.andP;  55 Hawthorne St., Ste.andP;  530 SanFrancisco, CA 94105 (415) 974-6462 Chassis, $285 Disk pack, $2,230 (84megabytes).andP;  The first drive purchased is discounted by 50 percent.andM;Disk PackandM;P84andM;Extra shock resistance is added to the very fast Quantum drives, and thewhole thing gets packaged in a small, sturdy plastic case.andP;  21, 42, and 125megabytes also are available, with a 200-megabyte model waiting in the wings.andO;Pros: Very user-friendly, with well-thought-out software and documentation.andO;Easy to set SCSI ID (although it uses two consecutive IDs).andP;  Cons: The singleunit is currently unavailable.andP;  No locking mechanism to prevent accidentalremoval.andP;  MegaDrive Systems 1801 Avenue of the Stars, Suite 507 Los Angeles,CA 90067 (213) 556-1663 Chassis, $799 Disk pack, $1,699 (84 megabytes)andM;Totable Hard-Disk DrivesandM;Unlimited data storage is the primary advantage of removable mass storage.andO;When one disk becomes full, simply eject it from the drive and insert afresh, blank one.andP;  A significant bonus of the removable mass-storage drive isits portability.andP;  You and your data are no longer tied to your work-station.andO;You can have computing-to-go without sorting through a box full ofconventional floppies.andM;But what if you don't care for the removable part of removable mass storage?andO;What if you just want a hard-disk drive that's portable enough to lug betweenhome and office?andM;Enter the compact portable hard-disk drive, or totable -- mass data storagein miniature.andP;  MacUser Labs tested several drives that we consider eminentlycompact and portable.andP;  Our criteria for a &quot;compact&quot; hard disk were few andsimple.andM;* Must weigh 5 pounds or less.andM;* Must have a footprint (width by length) smaller than that of a MacintoshSE.andM;We found six drives that fit the bill: the Plato Hardpac 20, the Liberty 80,the Cirrus 80, the Maxcess, the Pocket Hammer, and the Impact 80.andP;  With theexception of the Plato Hardpac 20 -- which stores 20 megabytes -- all thesedrives pack a whopping 80 megabytes.andM;For a drive to be truly portable, it must be capable of withstanding theshock and bustle of everyday transportation.andP;  Surprisingly, we found thatonly one drive, the Plato Hardpac 20, contained any appreciable shockprotection.andP;  The drive mechanism is mounted securely to a metal plate, andboth are encased in a hard plastic shell.andP;  This strategy doesn't eliminatethe small bumps and jolts that can disturb the drive during operation, but inthe event of a dramatic drop, the plastic and metal frame absorbs much of theimpact.andM;Making a hard-disk drive sturdy and shock-resistant has its disadvantages.andO;The Maxcess and Pocket Hammer use a large quantity of metal around the drivemechanism.andP;  This metal adds considerably to the weight of the drive, reducingits portability (both drives push the 5-pound limit).andP;  The LaCie Cirrus 80offers some protection during transportation with its padded carrying case.andM;Besides structural resilience, the totable hard-disk drives we looked atoffer the standard safeguards, including shock-absorbing mounts (usingresilient rubber to absorb vibration) and auto-parking heads.andP;  The delicateread/write heads return to a neutral zone over the disk when the drive isunmounted or turned off.andP;  By moving the heads to an unused portion of thedisk, there is less chance that a head crash will disrupt important data.andM;Besides portability, compact drives offer another sterling advantage: speed.andO;Leading the race for fastest Macintosh hard disk are the Liberty 80, Impact80, Maxcess, Pocket Hammer, and Cirrus 80, with performance records thatwould leave the most jaded speed demon agape.andP;  Not coincidentally, all thesedrives employ the lightning-fast Quantum ProDrive80, now considered one ofthe most reliable, and nimble hard-disk-drive mechanisms for the Macintosh.andM;We found, however, that the Impact 80 drive was significantly slower in itswrite times than the other drives.andP;  Everex Systems assures us that theproblem will be fixed with a driver update.andM;On the basis of support software, all the compact drives proved similar.andP;  Theonly big difference was posed by the Plato drive, which came with no softwareat all.andP;  The Plato arrived preinitialized with a 3:1 interleave; AristotleIndustries assumes that, should the drive ever need reinitializing, you'lluse the Apple hard-disk software.andM;With only one exception, compact hard-disk drives extract their power from anAC wall socket, just as your Macintosh does.andP;  To use the drive, you mustfirst plug it in and then stretch a suitable SCSI cable between the drive andthe Mac.andP;  This arrangement isn't as effortless as shoving a disk cartridge ina removable mass-storage drive, but the trivial weight of the average compactdrive makes the task of installation more palatable.andP;  Most &quot;toters&quot; here atthe Labs keep a connected SCSI cable at each location, making installation aspainless as possible.andM;Standing apart from the crowd, the Plato Hardpac 20 derives its power fromthe external drive connector on the back of your Mac Plus or Mac SE (thePlato cannot be used with a Mac II unless you add an external power supply,an added-cost option).andP;  This makes the Plato slightly easier to install --you don't need to hunt down a wall socket -- but it prevents you from usingan external floppy drive with your Mac.andP;  You'll need to weigh these pros andcons for yourself.andM;Magneto OpticalandM;Mag-neat-oh is more like it.andP;  Here's one that could give the Syquest-typedrives a run for their money.andP;  At Comdex/Fall, Verbatim (a subsidiary ofKodak) introduced a 3.5-inch (not 5.25-inch like the Sony and Canon) thermalmagneto-optical (TMO)-type drive for the Mac.andP;  These drives won't be widelyavailable until the summer of '89, but if you're not in a big hurry, it mightbe worth the wait.andM;The drive will cost about $3,000, with 60-megabyte cartridges available atapproximately $100 each.andP;  Verbatim claims a 30-millisecond average seek timeand a 12.5-millisecond latency for an access time around 40 milliseconds.andP;  Inthe 5.25-inch TMO arena, Sony, Canon, and Maxtor all have SCSI-equippeddrives just waiting for someone to come along and add a Mac driver.andP;  Thesedrives, which all will be in the $5,000 price range, hold from 512 to 650megabytes and have reasonably fast access times of from 90 to 100milliseconds.andP;  Canon's drive is currently available on Steve Jobs' NeXTmachine -- which incidentally makes merely half of its 512-megabyte capacityavailable, as it uses only one side of the cartridge.andP;  Pinnacle Micro(Irvine, Calif.) will offer a Mac implementation of the Sony drive.andP;  Thispackage, which should be shipping by the time you read this, sports a $5,995drive and a $230 (650-megabyte) cartridge.andM;Magneto-optical technology, with its virtual immunity to environmentaleffects, will offer a reliable and cost-effective alternative toconventional, relatively fragile magnetic storage.andM;Tester's ChoiceandM;In the high-capacity flexible arena, if cost is your main consideration, thengo with Mirror Technologies, Jasmine, or Peripheral Land.andP;  Jasmine'sMegaDrive 20 comes with good commercial utilities, worth well over thehundred dollars you save by buying Mirror Technologies' RM20.andP;  Otherwise thetwo drives are nearly the same.andP;  Peripheral Land's Infinity 10 offers thecheapest way to distribute 10 megabytes of data.andP;  Its 5.25-inch floppy disksare the lightest and least expensive.andM;On the other hand, if the shipping product matches the performance of theunit we tested, then Iomega's Bernoulli II/44 would be one removable systemwe could highly recommend.andP;  We looked at a preproduction unit that should beavailable by March '89.andP;  This drive should offer a very good mix ofreliability and speed at a reasonable price.andP;  But don't plan on reading yourold 20-megabyte cartridges with it -- that's not going to happen.andM;As far as the removable hard drives are concerned, you do get a fast, quiet,and &quot;sealed&quot; drive, but we're still not sure how to justify the highrecurring cost of additional capacity.andP;  In any case, if locking up 80megabytes of data every night is your thing, then any of the three units wetested would fit the bill.andP;  But then you could do the same thing with any ofthe removable-media drives for less cash.andM;When it comes to removable hard cartridges, if you're willing to take achance on a newcomer (we got an answering machine when we called), considerBay Microsystems; you can't beat the $1,149 price.andP;  Another newcomer, InfoTechnologies, provides a $1,199 price along with good service and support.andO;This could make a big difference if you need to know that someone is there tohelp.andM;In general, we don't have a problem recommending any of the Syquest-typedrives.andP;  If you're still not convinced that Syquest drives are the answer,you might consider waiting a few months for magneto-optical drives to appear(see sidebar, &quot;Magneto Optical&quot;).andP;  However, even then, it might be wise towait a bit longer and see whose standard will prevail.andM;The totable drives are perhaps the most practical solution for data on thego.andP;  An extra SCSI cable and AC cord are all that you need at the other end.andO;The 3.25-inch Quantum ProDrive 80 appears to be the drive of choice for thesemanufacturers.andP;  Here we prefer Maxcess, which comes with a low price and FWBsoftware.andP;  We also like LaCie's Cirrus 80 with SilvertLining and SilverServerincluded at  the quite reasonable price of $1,099.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
