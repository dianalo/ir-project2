But it was a grim group of owners who gathered in acorporate conference room. Eighty percent of their teams werelosing money. Their hopes for a favorable new contract withthe players' union had fizzled. Their prospects for a big newTV contract were fading.</LP><TEXT>   What's worse, the man before them, Commissioner PeterUeberroth, was making these business titans feel like naughtyschoolboys. To the American public, he was star-spangledcharisma. To them, he was a stern schoolmaster, posing barbedquestions and finding their performance wanting.   For a year, he had been repeatedly calling them &quot;dumb&quot; and&quot;stupid.&quot; The qualities that made them rich enough to own abaseball team deserted them once they'd bought one. Theyfoolishly thought they were always one high-priced free agentaway from a pennant. The fault lay not with the agents orunion but themselves. &quot;Look in the mirror and go out andspend big if you want,&quot; Mr. Ueberroth said, &quot;but don't go outthere whining that someone made you do it.&quot;   Now he was having labor-relations chief Lee MacPhaildeliver the latest bad news: Baseball owed a whopping $40million to released, retired players. The respected Mr.MacPhail, soon to retire, gave a valedictory speechcounseling self-discipline or disaster.   After a year of Mr. Ueberroth's hectoring, and with thislatest bad news, the owners were ready to be galvanized. Somestood up to confess their past stupidity; some took thepledge to abstain from free agents; some later likened it toa revival meeting. All listened closely to Mr. Ueberroth'sparting words. As one owner recalled it -- although Mr.Ueberroth denies it -- he closed this way: &quot;Well, you aresmart businessmen. You all agree we have a problem. Go solveit.&quot;   The next afternoon, player agent Tom Reich looked forwardto meeting with Bill Lajoie, the Detroit Tigers' generalmanager. He thought longstanding talks about a big long-termcontract for the Tigers' star catcher, Lance Parrish, werecoming to fruition. But Mr. Lajoie was clearly uncomfortablefrom the start. &quot;Look, I don't know quite how to tell youthis,&quot; he said, &quot;but we have reviewed this and decided thatthe best we can offer is a two-year contract and not at thekind of money we have been talking about.&quot;   &quot;Where did that bull come from?&quot; Mr. Reich asked.   &quot;We had some meetings and decided that these are theeconomics,&quot; said Mr. Lajoie, who would later maintain thedecision was made well before the Series. &quot;This is the bestwe can do.&quot;   Mr. Reich later called Mr. Parrish. &quot;Something's up,&quot; hesaid. Soon after, he wrote a warning memo to his otherclients. They were in for a mean season.   That season lasted from 1985 to 1988 and came to be knownas the collusion era. It froze the free-agent market andarrested baseball's salary spiral. Baseball went fromtattered finances to unprecedented prosperity. But, in theend, it crashed in on the owners, with $280 million indamages, the fundamental business problems of baseballunsolved and salaries more out of control than ever: Averageplayer pay has risen 50% in just the past year.   Many in management at the time, including Mr. Ueberroth,believe the arbitrators who ruled against them were wrong. &quot;Idon't know of anything close to a smoking gun,&quot; Mr. Ueberrothsays. &quot;If there was, I would have purged it.&quot; What's more, hesays, &quot;I don't think the owners are capable of colluding.They couldn't agree on what to have for breakfast.&quot;   Today, hundreds of players will file claims for theirshare of the collusion award. It is the biggest financial hitever taken by a sport, a crunching blow to strugglingfranchises. How did it happen? The foundation for thefollowing account lies in the record developed in threecollusion cases, together with the memories of baseballowners, executives, agents and players. Where accountsdiffer, it is noted.   Collusion was less a deep, dark price-fixing conspiracythan a harnessing of baseball's normal herd instincts. It wasan emotional reaction to an explosive, revolutionary decadein baseball. Its beginnings lay in Mr. Ueberroth'sbrowbeatings. But in many ways it had, in a phrase often usedby baseball people, &quot;a life of its own.&quot; Abstinence from freeagents gathered momentum, peer pressure racheted up and&quot;fiscal responsibility&quot; became the rage, congealing into acode: You don't touch my guys, I won't touch yours.   In many ways, it was a form of nostalgia: a return to thegood old days of the reserve clause, when players were tiedto a team for life. That practice ended in 1975, when anarbitrator ruled that pitcher Andy Messersmith could become afree agent when his contract expired. It opened the way forall other players to go free-agent, too, and made the sport'seconomics a whole new ball game. Free-agency meant, for thefirst time, multi-year contracts and big money. From 1976 to1985, the average salary rose 700%, to $369,000.   Baseball teams' front offices, holdovers from sleepiertimes, were hopelessly outgunned by sharp player agents.Owners' occasional efforts to turn back the tide fizzled. TheDetroit Tigers' John Fetzer once tried to start a buddysystem in which anyone considering a mega-signing would calla brother owner to talk him out of it. It didn't work.   The truth was most owners still cared more about winningpennants than losing money, and the sport's leadership wastoo weak to put up a fight. Commissioner Bowie Kuhn, tuggedand pulled by rival owner factions, delegated much to a crazyquilt of owners' committees. He was a lame duck for the lasttwo years of his 15 years as commissioner. In impotentdespair, baseball piled up a $277 million operating loss from1980 to 1984.   Then it elected Peter Ueberroth: Golden Boy of the$200-million-profit Olympics, Time magazine's man of theyear, national symbol of the '80s can-do spirit. Mr.Ueberroth had a favorite maxim: Authority is 20% given, 80%taken. He quickly moved to grab 100%. He disbanded thecommittees and disempowered their chairmen. He never let theExecutive Council, once the owners' inner circle, meet. Hedoubled the number of owners' meetings with the commissionerto four per year and told the owners, who were given tosending stand-ins, that they'd better be there personally.   These quarterly meetings were set up with great care,beginning with the sites. Mr. Ueberroth liked them in placesthe owners weren't used to, putting them more in his command.He liked classroom-style tiered meeting rooms, whichseparated the 26 owners and focused their attention on him.He fidgeted over details: the room's temperature, the slides'look and especially the meeting's agenda. Priority items camein that span after coffee had kicked in and before attentionlapsed. He made owners raise their hands to speak, shushedside conversations, scolded them for not doing theirhomework, embarrassed them if their attention strayed.   At one meeting, soon after taking office, Mr. Ueberrothannounced he'd figured out what was wrong with the economicsof baseball. &quot;Let's say I sat each of you down in front of ared button and a black button,&quot; he said. &quot;Push the red buttonand you'd win the World Series but lose $10 million. Push theblack button and you would make $4 million and finishsomewhere in the middle.&quot;   He looked around. &quot;The problem is most of you would pushthe red one.&quot;   Mr. Ueberroth chided them for checking their businesssense at the door. He couldn't believe teams' lack of budgetsand owners' lack of knowledge about their teams' numbers,beyond won-loss records. &quot;You are so damned dumb,&quot; he wouldsay. &quot;If there's a $500,000 decision in your otherbusinesses, you'll go to the purchasing agent and make himjustify it. In baseball, you'll make a $5 million playerdecision and you'll say, `That's not me; that's my generalmanager.'&quot;   He liked little parables that would make owners think ofbusiness parallels. &quot;If you had a friend and you really likedthe way his secretary took shorthand, would you double hersalary to take her away?&quot; he asked. &quot;Well, if you wouldn't dothat, why would you pay $1 million to take away anotherteam's second baseman who bats .237?&quot;   And they sat there and took it. &quot;That's what the ownerswanted,&quot; says George Argyros, then the Seattle Mariners'owner. &quot;We needed a very strong leader.                                                                                                          Opening the Books:   `That Can't Be Me'                                                                                                          By autumn 1985, Mr. Ueberroth was ready to seize on eventsof his first year in office. The owners had gone throughmonths of bruising talks with the players' union and come upempty on what they most wanted: a mechanism to controlsalaries. ABC and NBC were losing money on their baseballbroadcasts, which fed the teams $1 billion over six years.Mr. Ueberroth predicted repeatedly the next TV deals would godown. And the teams had for the first time opened their booksto each other that summer, and found 21 of 26 were losingmoney.   &quot;That can't be me,&quot; said Oakland Athletics owner WalterHaas, whose team had lost the most. Says Mr. Ueberroth now,&quot;I underestimated the embarrassment of opening the books.&quot;   But he made his point. A Sept. 28 owners' meeting atItasca, Ill., started out as a housekeeping session onminor-league issues and ended up a hand-wringing discussionon the majors' economy. Three weeks later, Mr. MacPhail'svaledictory stunned the owners. Among his highlights: Playerswith three-year contracts and up spent nearly 50% more timeon the disabled list than those with one-year contracts; andthe average player's batting average declined nearly 20points after he had signed a contract of three years or more.   And two weeks after that, baseball's general managersgathered in Tarpon Springs, Fla., for their annualpost-Series meeting. It wasn't enough for the owners to havethe gospel according to Ueberroth because general managersmake many of the personnel decisions. Mr. Ueberroth laced histalk with warnings against open checkbooks. &quot;It's not smartto sign long-term contracts,&quot; he said. &quot;They force otherclubs to make similar signings.&quot; If clubs wanted to sign afree agent, he personally &quot;wanted to know the economics&quot; thatjustified it.   ---   The following week, Kirk Gibson was bird hunting outsideKansas City as guest of the Kansas City Royals. The Royalswere obviously intrigued by the hard-hitting outfielder, andhe by them. Gibson had spent his career with the Tigers butthey were only offering $1.2 million a year for three years.With other stars reaching $2 million a year now, Gibson wasdetermined to try the free-agent market.   His agent, figuring this outing was just the first step inGibson's courting, made a call to Royals General Manager JohnScheurholtz while his client was still out in the woods. Hewas stunned at what he heard. &quot;Yes, Kirk Gibson is a fineballplayer,&quot; said Mr. Scheurholtz, &quot;but I really don't thinkwe have any interest.&quot; The agent was soon being rebuffed byevery other team, too.   By then, nine teams had drawn up written policies thathewed to Mr. Ueberroth's recommendations: typically, nocontracts longer than three years; none longer than two yearsfor pitchers; none longer than one year for marginal players.Some of the policies swore off free agents altogether.   By the first week of 1986, Kirk Gibson was in a bind. Ifhe didn't re-sign with the Tigers by Jan. 8, under baseball'srules, he couldn't sign with them until May 1. He might notplay until June, well into the season. If he got offers fromno one else -- and the silence was deafening -- he'd be outof baseball.   In New Zealand on a double-honeymoon -- he and best friendDave Rozema, a former Tiger pitcher, had married sisters --Mr. Gibson took a call from his agent a half-hour before themidnight deadline in the U.S. The four were sitting in arestaurant, deadlocked 2-to-2 on whether he should take aslightly sweetened offer from the Tigers. Mr. Gibson took outa coin for a flip. When it came down, he was headed back tothe Tigers.   ---   The final score of the 1985-86 free-agent season: Of 33free agents, 29 went back to their old teams, having receivedno other offers. The four who did move on were marginalplayers whose teams had signalled they didn't want them. Thefree agents averaged just a 5% salary increase. Two-thirdsgot just one-year contracts.   The frozen market quickly chilled non-free-agents, too.Many good players nearing the six years' service mark hadpreviously been signed to long-term contracts to keep themoff the free-agent market: 75 in the last two years alone.There were just 15 in the 1985-86 off-season. There wassuddenly no need to do it.                                                                                                          Ted Turner: `I've Been   The Stupidest'                                                                                                          To Mr. Ueberroth, the price of peace in the free-agentmarket was eternal vigilance. He kept preaching to the ownersagainst contracts over three years. He told them he wanted togo &quot;eyeball-to-eyeball&quot; with them if they considered them. Hecontinued to insult them. &quot;I'd be embarrassed to be running abusiness that was losing this kind of money,&quot; he sometimesscoffed.   Most important, he put them through rigorous show-and-tellexercises on their finances. As they came into the quarterlymeetings, the owners would be handed binders of salary data,organized team by team and detailing total payrolls, deferredpay, money owed released players and other data. Then, one byone, the owners would have to stand up and discuss thenumbers and the outlook. The exercise took up much of thequarterly meetings and kept everyone's feet to the fire.   Best yet, from Mr. Ueberroth's viewpoint, it was alwaysguaranteed to get off to a good start. The teams went inalphabetical order, which made the Atlanta Braves first. Theplayers were listed from highest to lowest paid, which madeBruce Sutter first. In 1986, the sore-armed pitcher was paid$1.67 million to pitch a total of 19 innings. &quot;Now that's,what, around $100,000 an inning?&quot; Mr. Ueberroth asked ownerTed Turner. &quot;That's quite a bit, but, well, I guess he'sworth it.&quot;   &quot;My God,&quot; the Yankees' George Steinbrenner wailed, &quot;I mustbe paying Omar Moreno $600,000, $700,000&quot; and the outfielderwasn't even playing for him any more. Cried Ted Turner: &quot;Idon't care if you call us stupid. I've been the stupidest SOBhere.&quot;   The exercise served a concrete function, too. As ownersdiscussed their teams, they would say whether they wanted tore-sign a player who was up for free-agency. It worked muchthe same as a third base coach's signals, veiled to outsidersbut crystal clear to insiders: Hands off or have at him.   Mr. Ueberroth denies there were any understandings butconcedes he had forged a new group dynamic. &quot;Free-agency hadbeen a macho thing with the owners -- taking pride in gettingthe other guy's players,&quot; he says. &quot;I got them in a roomtogether, and it was more difficult to do when they wereeyeball-to-eyeball.&quot;   Mr. Ueberroth periodically turned to baseball's lawyers,during meetings, and told them to stop him if he was gettingonto collusion grounds. They never did, though they didoccasionally halt owners, carried away in the raptures offiscal responsibility. They told owners that if it was theirindividual decision not to sign free agents, there was nobasis for collusion charges. There was nothing wrong withexchanging information without coercion, they said. &quot;Did weknow we were pushing the envelope?&quot; asks one of the lawyerstoday. &quot;Sure. But if we didn't talk about these things we'dbe ignorant. And our adversaries were not ignorant.&quot;   Mr. Ueberroth's main legal advisers were concerned aboutthe frozen free-agent market, fearing the owners had takenMr. Ueberroth's message too far and knowing the union wasmassing for a legal challenge. Player Relations CommitteeDirector Barry Rona actively urged some owners to get outthere and make bids.   But baseball's legal battery is now criticized by someowners, and some lawyers familiar with events, for largelyletting events roll along. They seemed, like the owners,hesitant to contradict the forceful commissioner. Theycertainly underestimated the downside risk of damages. (Theyalso declined to comment for this story, although they have adefender in union lawyer Eugene Orza. &quot;This is what I callthe owners' Geraldine syndrome,&quot; he says, referring to theFlip Wilson character. &quot;Every time they get caught, they sayit's somebody else's fault: The devil made them do it.&quot;)                                                                                                          Drowning in the   Free-Agent Waters                                                                                                          The lawyers were right about one thing: The union cameback fighting. Its executive director, Donald Fehr, hadn'tspent years building it into a powerful force to see theplayers turned toothless now. In February 1986, the unionfiled its first grievance. In over 200 days of hearings,spread over three years, the union took the collusion casethrough arbitration proceedings -- under the labor agreement,the only remedy for alleged contract violations.   The union's lawyers felt they had a strong circumstantialcase. But they were hard pressed to find a paper trail. And,as hearings began that summer, they were frustrated at theamnesia of baseball executives. And then a biggerfrustration: Just seven days into the hearings, in August1986, the owners fired arbitrator Thomas Roberts. After heruled against them in another case, they wanted him off thisone. He was eventually reinstated after the union contestedthe firing before another arbitrator. But the hearings weredelayed for months. Collusion was free to roll on.   Some of the owners were starting to make money again. Allof them were enjoying turning the tables and regaining ameasure of control. Says one baseball executive: &quot;The hardestpart in the beginning was the mistrust,&quot; suspecting someonewould break ranks with a big signing. &quot;By the second yearthey were seeing results. The feeling was, `Hey, for thefirst time we acted smart last year; why not keep going?'&quot;   As year two of collusion began, in the fall of 1986, thegeneral managers were delighted to be playing hardball aswell. They had long resented agents dancing negotiatingcircles around them; resented their loss of control overplayers; resented the money players now made. (Plenty ofgeneral managers were ex-players.)   When 1986 National League batting champion Tim Raines satdown at season's end with Montreal Expos General ManagerMurray Cook and other top club officials, he got a warning:Try testing the free-agent waters and he was apt to drown.Team President John McHale invoked the name of a player who15 years earlier legally challenged the reserve system andwound up exiled from baseball. &quot;Don't be the martyr like CurtFlood,&quot; he said.   When outfielder Rudy Law's agent approached Kansas CityGeneral Manager Scheurholtz about a new contract, he wastold, sure -- at a steep pay cut. &quot;In the past, we had to paythese players a lot of money to maintain the continuity ofour club,&quot; Mr. Scheurholtz told the agent. &quot;The game haschanged. That no longer has to be done. The owners havegotten smart.&quot; (The exchange was recounted by the agent inarbitration hearings. Mr. Scheurholtz wouldn't comment.)   When pitcher Jack Morris began exploring the free-agentmarket, he sent inquiry letters to every team. Instead ofbeing treated like the best pitcher in baseball, as hearguably was, the 21-game winner got replies as if he were aclassified-ad applicant. Some were form rejections; othersinvited him to &quot;make an offer&quot; to which the team could say&quot;yes or no.&quot;   That was one of three rote responses heard often fromgeneral managers. Mr. Rona of the Player Relations Committeehad suggested they respond to inquiries from free-agentplayers by saying either: 1) Not interested because ofanticipated economics, 2) Not interested due to club policyon free agents, or 3) Make us an offer, to which we can sayyes or no. The last was a reversal of the usual process, inwhich teams made proposals. It eliminated any chance of clubsstarting out too high. It eliminated any maneuvering room foragents; it helped teams say no.   There was an air of triumph as the general managers metfor their annual post-Series meeting in 1986. &quot;Clubs areworking together better, making fewer dumb financialdecisions, signing fewer multi-year contracts,&quot; said TorontoBlue Jays General Manager Pat Gillick. Mr. Ueberrothencouraged that the spirit continue. &quot;Be honest with eachother, exchange information,&quot; he said.   To a remarkable degree, baseball men had now internalizedthe Ueberroth message. When new Atlanta Braves President StanKasten attended his first baseball meetings, in December1986, he was startled. In basketball, where he headed theAtlanta Hawks, trade talk dwelt on how players would helpteams. &quot;In baseball, all anybody wanted to talk about wassalaries and money,&quot; he recalls. &quot;Before you ever talkedabout a player's skills you asked, `What's his contractlike?'&quot;   Between meetings, Mr. Ueberroth was aloof from owners. Hetold them from the start he wasn't going to be their friendand, indeed, he was privately contemptuous of many, whom hecalled &quot;whining, sniveling malcontents.&quot;   But through various sources, including a voluminousclipping service, he always had great intelligence on theiractivitiesand great capacity for retribution. He raised thecommissioner's maximum fining power to $250,000 from $5,000and used it aggressively. If an owner made comments Mr.Ueberroth found not &quot;in the best interests&quot; of baseball, hewas fined. If an owner was slow to stop selling oversizedbeers -- a Ueberroth edict to reduce fan rowdiness -- he wasfined. The fines weren't announced, leaving owners to stewprivately and get no sympathy. They were an excellentreminder of his authority.   So was Mr. Ueberroth's cash-disbursal method frombaseball's &quot;central fund,&quot; the repository of revenuedistributed to all teams. He had discretionary control overnew income from areas such as licensing and merchandising.With that, he would give up to $500,000 extra to teams thatwere on board with his causes such as minority hiring anddrug education. The recalcitrants were left to contemplatetheir sins.   As Jan. 8, 1987, approached, many top free agents faced adilemma. If they didn't sign with their old team by thatdate, they couldn't sign again until May 1. If they tooktheir chances on the market, they took their baseball livesin their hands.   On that date, Bob Horner listened to his last offer fromAtlanta. The Braves' slugger, coming off a 27-homer season,was being offered a 30% cut from his pay of $1.8 million.&quot;The days of the $2 million contract are over,&quot; BravesGeneral Manager Bobby Cox told him. &quot;You're going to burn atthe stake if you don't take this.&quot; (Or so Mr. Horner and hisagent remember the threat; Mr. Cox only remembers using theword &quot;burn.&quot;)   On that date, Rich Gedman and his agent were trying tosalvage a deal with the Red Sox, with whom they were farapart. They offered to come down to Boston's level on moneyif the All-Star catcher's contract enabled him to gofreeagent again next year. The two went home to sit by thephone until midnight for counteroffers, which never came.   On that date, catcher Bob Boone called Oakland AthleticsGeneral Manager Sandy Alderson: Would the A's be interestedin him if he walked away from the California Angels? (Hewanted a two-year contract; the Angels would only go one.)Yes, but at nowhere near the Angels' $900,000, said Mr.Alderson -- who then called Angels General Manager Mike Portto relate the conversation. Believing they had him sewn up,the Angels wouldn't give Mr. Boone the last $12,000 he wantedas a sweetener.   On that date, Tim Raines was looking at one offer: threeyears, $4.8 million from the Expos. No pauper's wages,surely, but only $100,000 a year over his old contract. Itgrated on his pride and goaded him on. &quot;I was coming off thebest year of my career, and I wasn't just going to cave in,&quot;he says. &quot;I felt like if I caved in, everybody else wouldhave been hurt, too.&quot;   Messrs. Horner, Gedman, Boone, Raines and four otherplayers would come to be known as the Jan. 8 Eight: playerswho went beyond the signing deadline and into the teeth ofcollusion. But if they were heroes to fellow players, theywere scorned by the general public: poor babies, condemned tobeing millionaires instead of multimillionaires.   Their stories and salaries have to be viewed in thislight, however: The sport that was pleading poverty wasactually exploding into prosperity. From 1984 to 1987, totalattendance rose 16%, setting records each year. In the samespan, licensing revenues grew more than 150%. Baseball ekedout its first pretax operating profit in eight years in 1986.The following year, with revenues up 15% and the averageplayer's salary down 2%, operating profit grew nearlytenfold, to $103 million.   Baseball was hot. Baseball players were out in the cold.   Even when one of the Eight got offers, baseball'speer-pressure system could be seen at work. When PhiladelphiaPhillies President Bill Giles said publicly he was interestedin free-agent catcher Lance Parrish, he was deluged by calls:from Detroit Tigers President Jim Campbell, who made clear hewanted to retain Parrish; from American League PresidentBobby Brown, who said he'd hate to see an American Leaguestar go to the other league; from White Sox Chairman JerryReinsdorf, who reminded Giles of his &quot;fiscalresponsibilities&quot;; from Milwaukee Brewers owner Bud Selig,who suggested he check with the Player Relations Committeebefore making an offer.   &quot;I'm catching tremendous heat from all over everywhere,&quot;Mr. Giles told Mr. Parrish and his agent. He offered Mr.Parrish $1 million, more than the $700,000 base the PRCadvised paying but much less than an All-Star catcher wouldhave commanded before. Even Mr. Giles admitted to theshortfall, offering to get Mr. Parrish some outsidepromotional work to compensate. But, he insisted, &quot;This isn'tcollusion; it's just the owners finally understanding what'shappening.&quot;   Mr. Parrish signed with Philadelphia.   ---   Dick Moss had begun the guerrilla method of free-agentmarketing with Jack Morris. The agent and the pitcher stageda whirlwind &quot;road show&quot; that forced meetings on four teamsbut no bids. Now Mr. Moss was determined to embarrasssomebody into signing another star client, Andre Dawson. Theoutfielder wanted to play for the Chicago Cubs, whose naturalgrass at Wrigley Field would ease his sore knees. But Mr.Moss went through months of futile approaches to Cubs GeneralManager Dallas Green, who kept demurring he couldn't signanother high-priced player.   In March, Messrs. Moss and Dawson walked into the Cubs'spring-training camp and into Mr. Green's office. Hissecretary said Mr. Green was unavailable -- all week. But Mr.Moss left with her a blank contract for Mr. Dawson and a noteinviting the Cubs to fill in a figure. Then he told the Cubs'beat writers, who trumpeted Mr. Dawson's coming in the nextday's papers. Mr. Green soon called Mr. Moss, furious atbeing put on the spot. &quot;Dallas knows a lot of bad words,&quot;says Mr. Moss, &quot;and he used most of them.&quot;   But a few days later, the Cubs did fill in the blank:$500,000 salary plus $200,000 in incentives. The base was a60% cut from Mr. Dawson's 1986 salary, making him the team'ssecond-lowest-paid veteran but keeping him from crawling backto Montreal. He took it.   Yet Mr. Green was less elated than defensive, writingapologetically to the Player Relations Committee and theleague presidents, &quot;I was not quite as prepared to respond orhandle this type of proposal as I probably should have been.&quot;   For the rest of the Jan. 8 Eight, the market proved evenmore barren. In early April, loathing a return to Atlanta andseeing no alternatives in America, Mr. Horner signed with theYakult Swallows of Japan. Tim Raines tried everything,including a one-on-one meeting with Houston Astros owner JohnMcMullen, sans agent. Mr. McMullen offered him a 37% pay cutand an interesting rationale: &quot;Once you're making $1million,&quot; said the owner, &quot;why worry about anything overthat?&quot;   Finally, in mid-April, Mr. Raines agreed to a slightlysweetened three-year contract with the Expos. Most of theJan. 8 Eight likewise returned to their old teams on May 1with a month's pay docked and a sour feeling in common. SaysRich Gedman, &quot;You felt like you came back like a beaten dog.&quot;   When Mr. Gedman returned to Boston, Red Sox ChiefExecutive Haywood Sullivan wasn't quite through after thecontract-signing. He laced into the player about how he'd letdown the fans; how he'd been greedy; how he'd been a dupe forthe union. Then he turned on Mr. Gedman's agent, Jack Sands.&quot;I know what you are thinking, Sands,&quot; he said. &quot;You arethinking there is collusion going on.&quot; He let loose a stringof profanities. &quot;Of course we talk. We talk all the time andyou talk to people all the time, too.&quot; (Mr. Sullivan doesn'trecall saying this, which was testified to by Messrs. Gedmanand Sands.)   Finally, Mr. Sullivan had spent his wrath, except for aparting shot: &quot;I don't care who you tell about this.&quot;                                                                                                          The Unraveling   And the Explosion                                                                                                          The average salary of that year's free agents declined16%. About 75% of free agents signed only one-year contracts.Only seven non-free-agents signed multiyear contracts. Thetables had been turned.   Nobody could know how soon things would change. InSeptember, arbitrator Thomas Roberts ruled on the union'sfirst case: guilty as charged. Now hearings on the 1986-87free-agent crop were under way, and, says union lawyer StevenFehr, &quot;the clubs' case was obviously falling apart.{Arbitrator} George Nicolau was asking tougher questions thanI was.&quot;   The Player Relations Committee's new lawyer, CharlesO'Connor, told Mr. Ueberroth to stop the payroll-reviewdrills. The PRC also turned to a modified form of marketcontrol, called an Information Bank. It was a clearinghouseto which teams reported bids for players and learned ofothers' bids. The idea was to blunt further collusion chargesand stimulate the market a bit. But the union filed anothergrievance anyway -- and the teams often used the Bank formischief. They would under-report bids in an effort to gainadvantage. They were reverting to their old self-interestedselves.   Collusion was starting to unravel. Mr. Ueberroth, on thehomestretch of his five-year term and not seekingre-election, didn't seem as interested. The owners lost thesecond collusion case. And the economic urgency had ebbedaway. Baseball's revenues hit $1 billion in 1988, itsoperating profit $121 million. Late that year, Mr. Ueberrothnegotiated four-year, $1.4 billion deals with CBS and ESPNthat doubled baseball's TV money.   Spirited free-agent bidding wars soon began to appearanew: Bruce Hurst to the San Diego Padres for a multi-year,$5.25 million deal; Andy Hawkins to the Yankees for $3.6million; Scott Fletcher to the Texas Rangers for $4.1million. And so on, in escalating form, to the present.   Salaries more than doubled from 1988 to 1991, reaching anaverage of $890,000. More than 30 players now make $3 milliona year, including Andre Dawson and Tim Raines. One team, theOakland Athletics, has a bigger payroll than all of baseballhad in 1976. One reason was the TV money, burning a hole inowners' pockets. Another was the geyser-like explosion thatoften goes with lifting wage controls. Still another, somesay, is a PRC-imposed code -- baseball's version ofpost-Watergate morality -- in which general managers can'tdiscuss player signings at all. &quot;It's a blind auction today,&quot;says the Oakland Athletics' Mr. Alderson.   Collusion's aftereffects roll on and on. It fed a stubbornunion/owner impasse that led to the 1990 spring-traininglockout. It belted teams like the Seattle Mariners and TexasRangers, straining to meet their $10.8 million-per-teamcollusion-damages bill. It created a fool's paradise in whichillusory profits deferred serious looks at concretestructural changes such as revenue-sharing.   Now some of the very panic that sparked collusion iscreeping back in. CBS Chairman Laurence A. Tisch admits heoverpaid for baseball, and the network has already writtenoff $170 million in losses. When its $1 billion contract isup, after 1993, baseball's TV money could go down. Thedistress signs are mounting. Every team was profitable in1989; 10 lost money last year. A successful team like thePittsburgh Pirates may have to break up its team's nucleusfor inability to afford it.   The sport's main hope, as some see it, is a jointunion/owner study committee now looking at the sport'seconomic problems. It's an encouraging piece of cooperationand includes some heavy-hitter outsiders such as formerFederal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker. But blue-ribboncommissions aren't known for effecting dynamic change.&quot;Baseball,&quot; says Phillies President Bill Giles, &quot;is rightback where it started from.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
