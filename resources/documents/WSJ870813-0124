There were few new reports of violence yesterday; as previously reported, Trans Natal Coal Corp. said Tuesday that a black miner who went to work in defiance of the strike was found dead in his bed, &quot;apparently murdered.&quot; At least 23 miners and three mine security officers have been reported injured since the strike began Sunday night.    In a further development yesterday, Anglovaal Ltd., which doesn't recognize the mineworkers' union, said it planned to dismiss striking workers at the Lorraine gold mine unless they returned to work by last evening.    Both the union and mine owners said yesterday that there weren't any plans for new negotiations over the miners' demands for a 30% wage increase and other benefit improvements.    The police said charges against the union members arrested at a meeting in Klerksdorp, southwest of Johannesburg, included subversion and plotting to murder strikebreakers. The union members are scheduled to appear in court Monday, the police said.    Cyril Ramaphosa, NUM's general secretary, said 86 union members were arrested at the meeting, raising to 177 the number of miners taken into custody during the strike. He said the union members arrested in Klerksdorp included &quot;the entire local leadership,&quot; and charged that the police action was &quot;part of a well-calculated plan to arrest union leadership and leave the strikers leaderless.&quot;    In other reported incidents, NUM spokesman Marcel Golding said 16 shaft stewards from two mines were detained Tuesday night by mine security officers as they were returning from a union meeting.    &quot;It is our view that the detentions . . . are tantamount to kidnapping and limiting the free movement of union representatives,&quot; Mr. Golding said.    Meanwhile, Mr. Ramaphosa said 121 of the 150 union members at the Rand Refinery voted to join the miners' strike. The refinery processes gold to an internationally acceptable level and is the funnel through which all of South Africa's gold exports, valued at $8.4 billion a year, have to pass.    The union didn't give details beyond the strike vote and didn't say when an actual work stoppage at the plant might begin.    Wage discussions are still under way at the refinery, so any strike action there would be illegal under South African law. Officials of the refinery, meanwhile, said any walkout there wouldn't disrupt operations. About half the refinery's employees are black.    Gold prices shrugged off the news of the strike vote, and posted slight declines. &quot;It was fully anticipated that some refiners would probably join the strike in sympathy,&quot; said William O'Neill, research director for Elders Futures Inc. in New York.    Moreover, gold specialists said that it would take many months before any supply problems arose. &quot;The threat of a supply disruption is not there at this point,&quot; Mr. O'Neill said.    The South African rand and gold shares also showed little reaction to yesterday's strike developments. Analysts said the walkout would have to continue in full force for several weeks before the South African economy would suffer significantly. Concerning the gold shares, one analyst said investors &quot;recognize that the assets of the gold mines are still in place, whether they are producing or not.&quot;    Trans Natal said police were investigating the only apparently strike-related death so far. The company didn't explicitly allege that the miner found dead in his bed had been killed for defying the strike call, but its statement said he was &quot;one of a small number of production workers who continued working despite the strike by almost the total workforce&quot; at the Blinkpan mine east of Pretoria.    Mr. Golding said the union would conduct its own investigation and added that the union &quot;does not now, nor has it ever, condoned murder.&quot;    Since the walkout began, management has accused strikers of assaulting miners who continue to work, while the union claims that members involved in legitimate organizing activities are being harassed and arrested. </TEXT></DOC>
