In the process, they learned you can fight City Hall -- and end upworking side by side with it.;    On Tuesday, the Mountain View City Councilgave its unanimous stamp of approval to the Old Mountain View NeighborhoodPreservation and Improvement Plan, a guideline to help maintain and developthe area of mostly older homes on tree-lined streets.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SCENIC AREA GETS BOOSTOLD MTN. VIEW PLAN APPROVED  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Two years of night meetings, public hearings and urgent phone calls finallyflowered in a plan that residents and city officials believe will reducetraffic intrusion from popular Castro Street. The neighborhood surrounds theglitzy row of restaurants and bars that provide night life in the area.;    Aspart of the plan, the council appropriated $60,000 to finance experimentaltraffic controls -- such as more traffic signs, street barricades and speedbumps -- to help lessen traffic hazards in Old Mountain View, bordered by ElCamino Real, Shoreline Boulevard, highways 85/237 and the Southern PacificRailroad.;    Studies completed by Korve Engineering show traffic in the areahad increased significantly since 1989, when Castro Street renovation began.The firm also found that the traffic accident rate in Old Mountain View wastwice as high as in any other city neighborhood.;    The plan also containsrecommendations for construction of new homes and remodeling of old ones inorder to maintain the historic flavor of the area, which features modestwood-frame cottages with big front porches as well as larger family homes.;   In short, the building guidelines encourage preservation of as much of thehomes' design as possible. The fronts of the homes should retain originalcharacter; garages should be set back from the houses where possible; andsecond-story additions should be compatible with existing architecture.;   The plan also recommends that land be acquired at Mercy and Bush streets tocreate a central neighborhood park; that sidewalks be installed, if necessary,and maintained on all streets; and that attractive lampposts eventuallyreplace standard streetlights.;    &quot;We're pleased with the final result of theprocess and I think we've all learned a lot about the political process,&quot; saidSteve Lewis, a member of the Old Mountain View Neighborhood Association.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  LORI ARATANI, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Peninsula/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910801  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  MAP  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  383  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday August 1, 199100214111,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
