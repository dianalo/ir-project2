With the apparent presidential nominees swapping generalelection rhetoric, Jesse Jackson denounced continuing questionsabout ``what Jesse wants.'' He called such questions ``demeaning,disrespectful and contemptuous'' and said his supporters aren'tfocused solely on whether or not Dukakis chooses him as runningmate.   ``They do not have a fixation on one position,'' Jackson toldreporters in southern California where he took a brief workingvacation.   Jackson said he and his supporters have other concerns, even asDemocratic officials meeting in Michigan expressed optimism theycould craft a party platform to Dukakis' liking that would alsomeet Jackson's standards.   Rep. William Gray III of Pennsylvania, the drafting committeechairman, said at the opening session on Mackinac Island, Mich,``As we go through the discussion of issues _ drugs, education,civil rights, health care ... hopefully they'll realize that theirdifferences are not that great and begin to come to a consensus ontheir own.''   In Boston, Dukakis was asked how he planned to respond toattacks in which Bush called him an elitist with close ties toHarvard University.   ``I don't,'' he said. ``I'm going to campaign on the issues. I'mgoing to talk about the future.''   Asked if he would bring up Bush's background _ which includesYale University _ Dukakis retorted:   ``I really am not interested. I don't think the American peopleare interested. I think that's a losing strategy.''   Bush didn't retreat an inch from the attacks he had madeThursday, saying the Democrats are trying to hide the Massachusettsgovernor's liberal stands.   ``There's this whole concept that he's a conservative and all,''Bush said. ``It's a game plan by the Democrats to protect him fromhis record.''   Bush, in Denver for the first of three unity rallies plannedacross the country by the Republican National Committee, complainedabout Dukakis campaign aides saying he is mudslinging.   ``You're looking at a guy who's been getting hit for six months,guilt by association, and all kinds of personal attacks,'' the vicepresident said. ``What happens now, they raise the mudslingingthing. ... This is going to be a fun campaign.''   In his speech to the GOP faithful, Bush said, ``It's my job nownot just to say what I'm for, but to give the American people thefacts about Governor Dukakis.''   ``I am not going to be deterred from telling the truth,'' hesaid.   Four of the vice president's former rivals _ Sen. Bob Dole ofKansas, Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, former Delaware Gov. Pete duPont and former Secretary of State Alexander Haig _ were on handfor the Denver rally. Only Pat Robertson said he could not make it.   The Massachusetts governor faced questions about whether hewould move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv _a very touchy issue in the Middle East. Jerusalem, a holy city inthree major religious traditions, is claimed by Jews and Arabs inthe regional conflict.   First, he said the embassy should ``go where the host nationsays its capital is.''   Pressed on specifics on Jerusalem, which Israel claims as itscapital, Dukakis finally said: ``I'd put our embassy there.''   Secretary of State George Shultz said earlier Friday that such amove ``would ruin'' Middle East peace efforts.   ``It would be a gigantic mistake and it's shocking that anybodywould make such a proposal,'' said Shultz.   The Massachusetts governor spent the day in Boston, workingmostly on state business, and had lunch with former PresidentCarter.   Dukakis said his lunch with Carter was ``terrific'' and that``lots of things'' were dicussed. The Democratic nominee-to-bewould not be more specific about his talks with Carter, whom Bushfrequently cites as a negative example of the kind of presidentDukakis would be.   In Michigan, Dukakis and Jackson representatives made it clearthey thought a first-draft platform ``dicussion paper'' prepared byformer presidential speechwriter Theodore Sorensen was short onspecifics. Gray assured the drafters they were in charge.   ``Our concern would only have been if the two candidates did nothave a free hand to draft the kind of platform that they and theyalone deserve to draft, because they attracted the largest numberof votes,'' said Eleanor Holmes Norton, representing Jackson.   Democratic Party chief Paul Kirk was still pushing his dream ofa short, readable platform.   ``I don't think we'll end up with the Yellow Pages, an ad forevery organized group,'' he said.   In Washington, a White House aide suggested Iran might try toexploit the presidential race ``by some means,'' according to TheWall Street Journal. The newspaper reported that a NationalSecurity Council memo warned that American hostages held in Lebanonby groups friendly to Iran could be pawns in an Iranian ploy.   The paper also said an Iranian official recently tried toarrange a secret meeting with a Bush aide. Bush, asked about that,said, ``No, I don't know anything about it, nothing.''</TEXT></DOC>
