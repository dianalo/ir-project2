It isn't another light bulb.   The newest technology, in fact, aims to do away with lightbulbs. Researchers at lighting companies are developingsystems to deliver light from a central source wherever it'sneeded, just like electricity or water. By eliminatingfixtures and electrical outlets for lamps, the new lightingpromises improved products and safety, starting in autos andhomes, the researchers say.</LP><TEXT>   Ford Motor Co. is trying the new lighting system in someconcept cars for display at auto shows. In those prototypes,instead of headlights, a 3-inch-wide lens runs across thefront of the car and projects both high and low beamschanneled from a &quot;light engine&quot; under the hood. GeneralMotors Corp. expects to install a limited version of thelighting in some production cars in 1994 or 1995.   Lighting manufacturers see the technology as a majoradvance in a field marked by few radical developments sinceThomas Edison's invention of the light bulb in 1879. &quot;It willrevolutionize lighting,&quot; says John Davenport, a seniorscientist at General Electric Co.'s lighting unit inCleveland. &quot;Contours of autos and the inside of homes wouldlook very different from what people are accustomed to,&quot; hesays.   In the new system, which GE calls a &quot;light engine,&quot; arecently perfected powerful light source acts as a&quot;reservoir&quot; from which light is drawn through fiber opticsand optical &quot;pipes&quot; without significant loss in intensity.The central source, called a high-intensity discharge light,employs a continuous electrical arc between two electrodes invaporized &quot;metal halides&quot; -- compounds of halogen and suchmetals as sodium -- which produce light 10 times more intensethan a standard incandescent light.   Metal-halide discharge lighting is used to light ballparksbut hasn't been practical in homes and autos because it takesa minute or so for the compound to turn into vapor andgenerate light. GE solved that problem two years ago byadding xenon gas in the bulb, causing the lamp to glow at theflick of the switch.   Last year, GE researchers coupled the arc with speciallydeveloped quartz rods inside the lamp that capture all thelight from the source and direct it into fiber-opticconduits. &quot;One of the biggest tricks was to get light intofiber optics without any loss,&quot; said Mr. Davenport.   Having developed a light source of sufficient intensity,researchers are concentrating on devising ways to transportit efficiently. GE researchers are working with fiber optics,while the Netherlands' NV Philips is using optical &quot;pipes,&quot;which are hollow plastic tubes with mirror-like interiorsurfaces. In theory, light fed at precise angles is totallyreflected inside both types of conduits and bounces along tothe end without losing intensity. In practice, however,impurities and bends in optical fibers, and pipes made ofmaterials considered economical for use in autos and homes,dissipate about 10% of the light every meter, says GE's Mr.Davenport. Researchers are now working to overcome thoseproblems.   Philips believes light pipe has advantages over fiberoptics in which light travels through the material itself.The pipe, in contrast, transmits light through its hollowcore, and Philips researchers contend they can compensate fordissipation by enlarging the pipe's diameter and sending morelight through it. &quot;There's a limit to how much you canenlarge fiber optics without jeopardizing the light'sinternal reflection,&quot; says Jack Michael, a product manager atPhilips's U.S. lighting unit in Somerset, N.J.   GE's Mr. Davenport counters that optical pipes are morecostly and difficult to bend than fiber optics.   Researchers also face other challenges. They say theyhaven't yet developed couplings and other devices comparableto the plugs and connectors used in the electrical system.Centralized switches that can independently control light atdifferent locations -- headlights, instrument panels,overhead lights, turn signals, the compact-disk player in acar, for instance -- also remain an elusive concept.   Given the complexities, Ford is taking one step at a time.An average car has nearly 80 bulbs. Instead of replacing themall with one central light source, the auto maker for now istesting one high-intensity discharge source under the hood toreplace the two sets of front lamps. Ford has installed thatlighting in a concept car it introduced at the Chicago autoshow earlier this month. But &quot;it would take three years ofaggressive efforts&quot; for such lighting to show up in aproduction car, says Gene Windross, a Ford product-designengineer.   GM expects to install just the high-intensity dischargelamps in some of its car lines by 1995, at $100 to $250premium to customers. These lamps would be significantlysmaller than the standard bulky lamps used in all carscurrently. The No. 1 auto maker doesn't see GE's extensive&quot;light engine&quot; concept as yet practical. But it willnevertheless pursue it because of &quot;the desire to drop thefront of the car,&quot; says George Graves, director of strategicinitiatives in lighting and bumper systems at GM.   Mr. Graves says that by eliminating the currentheadlights, GM and other auto makers would be able to lowerthe hood to reduce air resistance and thus improve fuelefficiency. Eliminating traditional large headlights willalso create room for stylistic changes, he says.   GE's Mr. Davenport says that when all the technicalhurdles are overcome the light engine will also be practicalin homes. He said GE researchers are trying to develop such alight source, which would be 10 times more intense than the50- to 100-watt central source required for automobiles.   In a typical use envisioned for homes, a light reservoircould be installed in the basement and the light channeledinto the rooms through fiber optics. It would do away withmost of the bulky fixtures used today. Initially, suchlighting would be incorporated into new homes but adaptationof older structures is also a possibility.   How fast the applications will spread depends not only ontechnology but on the evolution of a supplier base for parts.Mr. Davenport says that GE can make the light sources butisn't interested in making the fiber optics and the couplingsand switches because &quot;there's an enormous amount of customwork involved.&quot; He says GE is talking with potentialsuppliers to develop low-cost manufacturing capabilities andrecommending them to auto makers.   Mr. Davenport doesn't believe the central-lighting conceptwill replace the light bulb altogether. He says it willcoexist with other forms of lighting. &quot;When we developed themore-efficient fluorescent light, a lot of people thought allincandescent lights will disappear,&quot; he says. &quot;That didn'thappen.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
