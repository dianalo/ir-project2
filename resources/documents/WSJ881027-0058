A few of the executives admit to being tempted, some say they hear the music but are inclined to walk away, and even more denounce the phenomenon altogether. While leveraged buy-outs appear to be conversation topic No. 1 in America's corporate suites, a Wall Street Journal survey of chief executives suggests that Wall Street's rapture with the LBO may be getting out of hand.    &quot;Everyone in this day and age thinks about LBOs because it's the popular thing to consider, and if you didn't consider it, you would be backward. It doesn't make them right,&quot; says Michael D. Dingman, the chief executive of Henley Group Inc. &quot;Why do popular people start wearing miniskirts or buying Hula-Hoops and Barbie dolls? It's current. It's in the environment now.&quot;    David M. Roderick, USX Corp.'s chairman, believes that LBOs render debt-laden companies powerless to spend for research and development and state-of-the-art equipment essential for being globally competitive. &quot;I don't think it's a good thing long term for the manufacturing sector of America. I think it's good for short-term profits on Wall Street,&quot; he says.    And Charles Exley, the chief executive of NCR Corp., considers LBOs bad for the country because &quot;this cowboy capitalism requires devoting a large part of the economy to buying and selling companies. It's not terribly productive.&quot; He predicts the pendulum will swing away from LBOs in a few years.    Still, the recent $13.9 billion recapitalization proposal at Kraft Inc. and the $17.6 billion buy-out plan at RJR Nabisco Inc. have clearly intensified interest in LBOs and changed the terms of the debate. Whereas many public companies once simply dismissed the prospect of an LBO as unfeasible given their large size, they are now having to rethink the fundamental reasons for being a public, rather than private, corporation. Risk-taking, research and development, and long-term growth now are getting serious discussion.    Journal reporters contacted more than three dozen companies in an effort to gauge LBO fever in corporate America. Roughly half the companies refused to discuss the topic. &quot;We don't discuss it. We don't talk about it at all -- period,&quot; says Al Greenstein, a spokesman for Atlantic Richfield Co., an oil, gas and minerals company.    A few companies do acknowledge an active interest in doing an LBO. One is U.S. Shoe Corp. And investment bankers report an increase in inquiries from companies considering LBOs.    Langhorne Reid, the co-head of mergers at PaineWebber Group, says LBOs carry two main attractions for executives: wealth and control. &quot;The LBO offers dramatically magnified wealth-building opportunities in a familiar working environment,&quot; Mr. Reid says. &quot;And it gives the executive a greater feeling of control over his own destiny, and that of his own employees.&quot;    The flip side, he says, are &quot;the obvious risks&quot; -- namely, those who fail tend to lose their jobs and go broke. &quot;The tremendous availability of capital these days is encouraging executives to test the limits of leveragability,&quot; he says.    Nonetheless, more executives than ever before are looking at buy-outs. &quot;Investment bankers on new-business calls and LBO firms just coming in out of the cold are showing executives the possibilities,&quot; Mr. Reid says.    Many companies acknowledge having considered leveraged buy-outs in the past or are leaving the door open for them in the future. At Hasbro Inc., Stephen Hassenfeld, the chief executive, says the Pawtucket, R.I., maker of toys and games isn't talking right now about a leveraged buyout, but he adds: &quot;That doesn't mean that at 2 p.m. today we won't be discussing it. It isn't on the agenda, but you have to retain flexibility-and never say 'never.'&quot;    Mr. Hassenfeld says, though, that anyone approaching Hasbro with an LBO proposal &quot;will have to do a lot of good, solid selling.&quot; The company has been approached in the past, he says, by parties he won't name. But, like chief executives in many industries, he believes that the idea isn't sound in the toy industry because the added debt can be debilitating.    &quot;In many ways, the toy companies that do the best are those that have the least leverage on their balance sheets,&quot; he says. &quot;When you're in an industry {like toys} where a large amount of innovation and new products are needed, you're involved in more new tooling, more risk. In a given year, if it doesn't work favorably for you, you have to be able to switch&quot; -- and too much leverage makes this impossible.    Although Mr. Hassenfeld suspects that many of the LBOs to date won't work because of over-leveraging, he makes exceptions of RJR and Kraft. He believes that they &quot;have tremendous assets&quot; in their brand names that can be counted on for profits without research-and-development spending year after year.    Among chief executives that admit to having considered an LBO, the most common reason for just saying &quot;No&quot; can be summed up with one word: debt.    &quot;I've thought about it casually, but I look at these companies and wonder how they're going to service the debt,&quot; says Rowland Schaefer of Claire's Stores Inc., a Miami-based costume-jewelry retailer. &quot;I am not considering a leveraged buy-out. I don't want to get heavily into debt. Right now, our effort is on building up our business.&quot; Mr. Schaefer, who controls 38% of the voting stock, adds, &quot;For years, I was in business and had tremendous debt, and it feels good not to have it.&quot;    In expressing fear of too much debt, some executives specifically say their cash flow -- net income before depreciation -- might be inadequate to service it. Mr. Dingman of Henley Group, a La Jolla, Calif., company with interests in engineering and financial services, says he &quot;considered {an LBO} in the past but ruled it out on the basis of a lack of cash flow. Banks want to know how you are going to pay off the debt.&quot; He adds, &quot;Henley has a strong asset base but a low cash flow. It's not the kind of company that is geared to an LBO.&quot;    In Pasadena, Calif., Ralph O. Kehle, the chief executive of Hershey Oil Corp., explains in some detail why the independent oil and gas exploration company ruled out an LBO three months ago after talking to its investment bankers.    &quot;I rejected it because I perceived that it wouldn't work,&quot; he says. &quot;We didn't have the cash flow to pay off the debt. The free cash flow is about $1.5 million a year, and the debt would be around $35 million. It {the cash flow} doesn't even pay the interest.&quot;    An LBO, he adds, is &quot;supposed to look appealing to management, but it doesn't look appealing to us. Going broke doesn't help management.&quot;    Chief executives also cite other reasons for being wary. An LBO, says Edward Baker of Florida Rock Industries Inc., isn't under consideration at the cement and construction concern because &quot;it's almost like wearing two hats. If I'm going to buy a company, obviously I'm going to try to get it as cheap as I can. But as chief executive, I'd feel obligated to get the best price possible for shareholders. So, there's a conflict there.&quot;    Mr. Baker is even worried about banks that finance LBOs. &quot;From a bank's point of view,&quot; he says, &quot;these LBOs are something that's going to wind up giving them lots of trouble. . . . The problem is that all your projections are predicated on an upward economy with some degree of inflation so you can make the damn things pay out. Real life doesn't work that way.&quot;    Mr. Exley of NCR, a big Dayton, Ohio, computer maker that also considered and rejected an LBO, cites an even-wider range of considerations. &quot;From a personal-greed standpoint, there's an appeal,&quot; he concedes. But &quot;we decided it wasn't in the best interest of our stakeholders,&quot; including employees, customers and bondholders as well as stockholders.    &quot;What do the bond ratings mean when these can happen?&quot; he asks. &quot;If we have a significant business retraction, people will learn the difference between a low-grade bond and a triple-A security.&quot;    Some companies rejecting the LBO idea cite the advantages of being a publicly held company. James A. Edris, the director of investor relations for Hershey Foods Corp., says the Hershey, Pa., company intends to stay public because &quot;it is our mission to become a major diversified food company, and, to do that, we need access to capital and equities markets.&quot; He explains that &quot;Hershey is averse to excessive debt. It doesn't fit our corporate philosophy. I feel leveraged buy-outs are a big gamble that are mostly done to see what the break-up value is. That's not the way we view the world here.&quot;    Similarly committed to remaining a publicly traded company is Albertson's Inc., a Boise, Idaho, grocery chain and one of a dwindling number of big supermarket concerns that haven't been acquired or taken private to avoid a hostile bid. &quot;The best way to not be a target is to keep earnings up,&quot; says Gary Michael, the chief financial officer and vice chairman.    Noting that many companies going private contend that they will be freed from having to deliver strong earnings period after period, Mr. Michael adds, &quot;We don't mind being subject to having to increase earnings every quarter. We think that's the best way to run a company.&quot;    Some chief executives rule out an LBO with a touch of pride, citing the company's fast growth. V.H. &quot;Pete&quot; Van Horn of National Convenience Stores Inc., of Houston, concedes that an LBO &quot;has crossed my mind,&quot; but he adds that the chain hasn't seriously considered it because it hopes to grow instead of shrink.    &quot;A lot of companies that pursue LBOs are mature companies and are comfortable shutting down growth while they reduce debt. We're not in that position,&quot; he says. &quot;We feel we have significant growth opportunities in our business. Our purpose is best served by remaining a public company.&quot;    The company's growth requires additional capital for adding new stores, building inventories of new products and making acquisitions, none of which are compatible with high debt levels, he explains. In addition, he says, employees, executives and directors of National Convenience already own 30% of the company, more than managers generally receive in an LBO. </TEXT></DOC>
