The settlement talks come six months after the SalomonInc. unit first disclosed that it had submitted bogus bids ateight Treasury note auctions. A settlement isn't expected tobe concluded before April.</LP><TEXT>   There has never been any doubt that Salomon would seek asettlement and face SEC civil penalties, since the firm haspublicly admitted it violated Treasury bidding rules andfederal securities laws.   Salomon has set aside a $200 million reserve for potentialliabilities from the Treasury auction-bidding scandal; itslawyers have told people that the firm shouldn't be forced topay more than $50 million in fines and penalties.   But the SEC is under considerable pressure from Congressto extract a greater toll. While there hasn't been anydiscussion about the size of any fine Salomon will have topay, those involved in settlement negotiations saidcongressional officials have pressed the agency to make it abig one.   A Salomon spokesman declined to confirm the settlementtalks, but said the firm &quot;has cooperated in unprecedentedfashion&quot; with the government since August. William McLucas,the head of the SEC's enforcement division, declined tocomment.   While Salomon has begun talking with the SEC, peoplefamiliar with the talks say a settlement won't be concludeduntil the firm also reaches an agreement with the U.S.Attorney's Office in Manhattan and the Department of Justicein Washington, which are both conducting criminalinvestigations of the Treasury bidding scandal.   Salomon hasn't been told that it won't face criminalcharges, but individuals familiar with the investigation sayit is increasingly unlikely that Salomon will have to pleadguilty to such charges. A plea to criminal charges can be aserious blow to a big securities firm, because it can driveaway both customers and lenders.   Salomon has blamed its problems on Paul Mozer, the formerhead of its government bond trading desk who was fired inAugust. Mr. Mozer's attorney, Stanley Arkin, has tried tonegotiate a plea bargain agreement on Mr. Mozer's behalf withthe Manhattan U.S. Attorney's office, people familiar withthe matter say. But those talks have been suspended. Mr.Arkin wasn't available for comment.   Salomon's negotiations with the SEC could drag on for sometime. The SEC hasn't told the firm what civil charges it islikely to face. And Salomon isn't prepared to concede certainviolations.   The toughest sticking point is likely to be the Treasury'sMay 1991 auction, at which Salomon has acknowledged itcontrolled for itself and its customers a staggering 86% ofthe $12.26 billion in two-year notes sold. People familiarwith Salomon's position say the firm denies that it colludedwith customers to corner the market for the two-year notesand drive up their price after the May auction.   These people say Salomon is prepared only to admit that itmay have submitted a &quot;partially false&quot; bid on behalf of oneclient, Tiger Management Corp., at the May auction. ButSalomon now believes that it disposed of Tiger's positionshortly after the auction.   As to any potential government allegation of collusion,Salomon &quot;is willing to litigate that claim if it comes tothat,&quot; said one individual with knowledge of the firm'sposition.   Another point of contention between Salomon and the SEC islikely to be the fines and penalties that Salomon will face.Such penalties are usually set in accordance with the amountof illegal profits that a securities firm earned.   Salomon told the SEC last October that its profits fromseven Treasury auctions where it definitely submitted falsebids on behalf of customers totaled no more than $4.6million. (The status of Salomon's profits from the eighthauction, in May 1991, remain in dispute.) Indeed, Salomon hassaid that its profits at auctions where it bid improperlywere less than its profits at other auctions where noimproprieties were found. Moreover, a report prepared bySalomon for the SEC says the illegal bids didn't result inmonetary harm to competing bidders or to the U.S. government.   Securities lawyers say the Salomon case represents thefirst time that a securities firm will be punished under new,tougher regulations passed by Congress in 1990.   In addition to monetary fines and penalties, the SEC couldimpose other civil sanctions on Salomon. Those sanctionscould include putting the firm on administrative probation,enjoining it from committing further violations of securitieslaws, revamping certain of Salomon's operations and requiringthe firm to appoint board members or managers acceptable tothe SEC.   However, the SEC isn't expected to impose too harsh arange of sanctions. That's because Salomon, under a newmanagement led by Interim Chairman Warren Buffett, hasalready taken sweeping steps on its own to change many of itsprevious practices. The firm has also cooperated fully withthe government since the investigation began.</TEXT></DOC>
