The move is partof an effort by non-OPEC producers to shore up world oil prices bycutting or freezing exports.   The action was announced Friday by Vladimir Arutyunyan, chairmanof the Soyuzneftexport All-Union Foreign Trade Association, whichmarkets Soviet petroleum products abroad, the official Soviet newsagency said.   The announcement indicated a change in Soviet thinking about oilexports. In November, the deputy oil minister, Vladimir Filanovsky,said the country planned to continue increasing exports in the faceof falling world prices because it needed the foreign currency.   Tass quoted Arutyunyan as saying the oil exports will be reducedby about 5 percent in the first six months of 1989 compared with thesame period last year. The Soviets export an estimated 1.8 millionbarrels of oil a day. A 5 percent reduction would mean a cut of90,000 barrels daily in export sales.   In trading Friday, energy futures prices declined in volatiletrading, with crude oil soaring toward the $19-a-barrel level beforetechnical selling set in. Analysts in New York said the brief risecame after the Soviet Union, Mexico and Egypt _ producers outsidethe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries _ all announcedthe 5 percent reduction in exports.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the April contract for WestTexas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, settled 16 cents lowerat $18.56 a barrel, after rising as high as $18.88 at one pointduring Friday's session.   Earlier this week, oil producers outside OPEC met in London tocoordinate output with the 13-member oil cartel. At the end of themeeting, a majority of the countries pledged to freeze or reducetheir exports during the second quarter of 1989 in an attempt toshore up world oil prices.   The Soviet Union reportedly told the other countries it wasunsure whether it would reduce exports, but that if it did, it wouldnotify them Friday. The Tass dispatch quoting Arutyunyan wasdistributed late Friday in Moscow.   According to the CIA's 1988 ``International Energy StatisticalReview,'' of the amount of oil the Soviets exported daily in 1987,7,000 barrels went to the United States, 243,000 to Finland, 209,000to France, 302,000 to Italy, 142,000 to the Netherlands, 199,000 toWest Germany, 130,000 to India and 20,000 to Japan.</TEXT></DOC>
