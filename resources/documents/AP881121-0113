The rule, proposed by a 6-1 vote with board member Martha Segerdissenting, would require that the approximately 7,000state-chartered banks owned by holding companies get the Fed'spermission before estabishing real estate, insurance and othernon-banking subsidiaries.   Proponents of the rule say some states have moved aggressively toauthorize new activities without regard for bank safety andsoundness. Opponents say the Federal Reserve should not seek morepower over state banks.   Regulation Y, adopted in 1971, has allowed state banks topurchase non-bank firms without Fed approval under the Bank HoldingCompany Act.   The change could be adopted in three to six months. It wouldexempt non-bank businesses already owned by state-chartered banks,although Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson asked the Fedstaff to solicit comment on the possibility of requiring divestitureof such activities.   A recent federal court ruling requires nationally-chartered banksto receive Federal Reserve permission before acquiring a non-banksubsidiary. The decision is being appealed and the Federal Reserve'sstaff said it would propose rules for national banks later.</TEXT></DOC>
