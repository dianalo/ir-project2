These visibility provisions were submitted to EPA inorder to satisfy the second part of the Settlement Agreement with the EnvironmentalDefense Fund, et al., described at 49 FR 20647 on May 16, 1984. The schedulefor submittal and promulgation of these visibility provisions was renegotiatedand subsequently extended by a court order on September 9, 1986. The second part of the settlement agreement required EPA to propose andpromulgate Federal Visibility SIP's, henceforth called Federal ImplementationPlans (FIP's), addressing the general visibility plan provisions includingimplementation control strategies (andSection; 51.302), integral vista protection(andSection;andSection; 51.302 through 51.307), and long-term strategies (andSection;51.306) for those states whose SIP's EPA had determined to be inadequatewith respect to the above provisions (see January 23, 1986, notice of deficiency(52 FR 3046) and March 12, 1987, notice proposing FIP's for deficient StateSIP's (51 FR 7803)). However, as provided in the renegotiated settlementagreement, a state could avoid the promulgation of said provisions if theysubmitted a visibility SIP by August 31, 1987. The Commonwealth of Kentuckysubmitted such an approvable plan. The principal effect of the Kentuckyvisibility plan is to assure that the State is making and continues tomake progress towards the national goal of ``prevention of any future,and the remedying of any existing, impairment of visibility in mandatoryclass I Federal areas which impairment results from manmade air pollution.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES:</T2> This action will become effective on September 12, 1988,unless notice is received by August 11, 1988, that someone wishes to submitadverse or critical comments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES:</T2> Written comments on this action should be addressedto Stuart Perry at the EPA Regional Office address listed below.

This submittalcontained certification that the revision was preceded by adequate noticeand a public hearing. A discussion of the revision now follows. <ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>On December 2, 1980, EPA promulgated visibility regulations at 45 FR 80084,codified at 40 CFR 51.300 et seq. The visibility regulations required thatthe 36 states listed in andSection; 51.300(b)(2): (1) Develop a program toassess and remedy visibility impairment from new and existing sources,(2) develop a long-term (10 to 15 years) strategy to assure progress towardthe national goal, (3) develop a visibility monitoring strategy to collectinformation on visibility conditions, and (4) consider any ``integral vistas''(important views of landmarks or panoramas that extend outside of the boundariesof the Class I area and considered by the Federal Land Managers (FLM's)to be critical to the visitor's enjoyment of the Class I areas) in allaspects of visibility protection. These regulations only address a typeof visibility impairment which can be traced to a single source or smallgroup of sources known as reasonably attributable impairment or ``plumeblight.'' The EPA deferred action on the regulation of widespread homogeneoushaze (referred to as regional haze) and urban plumes due to scientificand technical limitations in visibility monitoring techniques and modelingmethods (see 45 FR 80085 col. 3). In December 1982, environmental groups filed a citizen's suit in the UnitedStates District Court for the Northern District of California allegingthat EPA had failed to perform a nondiscretionary duty under section 110(c)of the Act to promulgate visibility SIP's for the 35 states that had failedto submit SIP's to EPA (EDF vs Gorsuch, Number C82-6850 RPA). The Stateof Alaska had submitted a SIP which was approved on July 5, 1983, at 48FR 30623. The EPA and the plaintiffs negotiated a settlement agreementfor the remaining states which the court approved by order on April 20,1984. EPA announced the details of the settlement agreement at 49 FR 20647(May 16, 1984). The settlement agreement required EPA to promulgate federal visibilitySIP's, henceforth called Federal Implementation Plans (FIP's), on a specifiedschedule for those states that have not submitted visibility SIP revisionsto EPA. Specifically, the first part of the agreement required EPA to proposeand promulgate FIP's which cover the monitoring and new source review (NSR)provisions under 40 CFR 51.305 and 51.307 provided the states did not submitSIP's by May 6, 1985. On May 3, 1985, Kentucky submitted a draft visibility SIP to address therequirements of 40 CFR 51.305 and 51.307. EPA was required to approve theState submittal or to promulgate federal programs by January 6, 1986. OnFebruary 13, 1986, EPA promulgated a federal program to meet the requirementsof andSection;andSection; 51.305 and 51.307 for Kentucky since the State hadnot yet submitted a final plan. The federal program which is covered bythe federal visibility monitoring strategy (andSection; 52.26) and visibilityNSR program (andSection; 52.27 and 52.28), was promulgated as part of theKentucky SIP. On February 20, 1986, Kentucky submitted a final SIP revisionto satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR 51.305 and 51.307. The submittalconsisted or revisions to Regulations 401 KAR 51.017 (Prevention of SignificantDeterioration (PSD)) and 401 KAR 51.052 (New Source Review in NonattainmentAreas) to satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR 51.037. EPA proposed approvalof the PSD regulation on March 17, 1987 (52 FR 8311). However, since EPAhas not yet approved the PSD or nonattainment NSR rules, EPA has not removedthe provisions which were promulgated on February 13, 1986, to meet therequirements of 40 CFR 51.307. Also, included with the submittal was avisibility monitoring plan to satisfy the 40 CFR 51.305 requirements. EPAhas not yet acted to approve the monitoring plan which would replace thefederally promulgated provisions. The second part of the settlement agreement required EPA to determine theadequacy of the SIP's to meet the remaining provisions of the visibilityregulations. These provisions are the general plan provisions includingimplementation control strategies (andSection; 51.302), integral vista protection(andSection;andSection; 51.302 through 51.307) and long-term strategies (andSection;51.306). The settlement agreement required EPA to propose and promulgateFIP's on a specified schedule to remedy any deficiencies. The originaldeadlines for promulgating the FIP's were extended by a court order onSeptember 9, 1986. The order provided that a state could avoid federalpromulgation if it submitted a SIP to address the Part 2 (remaining visibilityprovisions) requirements by August 31, 1987. The remaining visibility provisions are spelled out in andSection; 51.302(c)(General Plan Requirements) and require that the SIP's include: 1. An assessment of visibility impairment and a discussion of how eachelement of the plan relates to the national goal, 2. Emission limitations, or other control measures, representing best availableretrofit technology (BART) for certain sources, 3. Provisions to protect integral vistas identified pursuant to andSection;51.304, 4. Provisions to address any existing impairment certified by the FLM,and 5. A long-term (10-15) year strategy for making progress toward the nationalgoal pursuant to andSection; 51.306. On January 23, 1986, at 51 FR 3046, EPA preliminarily determined that theSIP's of 32 states (including Kentucky) were deficient with respect tothe remaining visibility provisions. In that same notice, based on informationreceived from the Department of the Interior (DOI) and the Roosevelt CampobelloInternational Park Commission, 10 Class I areas in 7 states were identifiedas experiencing visibility impairment within the park boundaries whichmay be traceable to specific sources (reasonably attributable impairment(RAI)). However, the DOI stated in its certification of impairment thatthe results from the National Park Service (NPS) visibility monitoringprogram indicate that scenic views are affected by uniform haze at allNPS monitoring locations within the lower 48 states. Kentucky was not identifiedas experiencing RAI. Also, no integral vista has been identified for anyClass I area in Kentucky. Since Kentucky's Class I areas are not experiencingreasonably attributable impairment of visibility, and since no integralvistas have been identified, items 2, 3, and 4 of the above list do notapply (this is so stated in the Kentucky plan). The Kentucky plan revolvessolely about the State's long-term strategy. <ITAG tagnum="84">Plan Requirements_Long-Term Strategy </ITAG>EPA's regulations require that the long-term strategy be a 10 to 15 yearplan for making reasonable progress towards the national goal. The long-termstrategy must cover any existing impairment that the FLM certified andany integral vista that the FLM's have declared at least six months beforeplan submission. A long-term strategy must be developed which covers eachClass I area within the state and each Class I area in another state thatmay be affected by sources within the state. The strategy must be coordinatedwith existing plans and goals for a Class I area including those of theFLM's. The strategy must state with reasonable specificity why it is adequatefor making reasonable progress toward the national goal and include provisionsfor the review of the impact of new sources as required by andSection; 51.307.The state must consider as a minimum the following six factors in the long-termstrategy: 1. Emission reductions due to ongoing air pollution control programs; 2. Additional emission limitations and schedules for compliance; 3. Measures to mitigate the impacts of construction activities; 4. Source retirement and replacement schedules; 5. Smoke management techniques for agricultural and forestry managementpurposes, including such plans as currently exist within the state forthese purposes; and 6. Enforcement of emission limitations and control measures. The SIP must include a statement as to why these factors were or were notaddressed in developing the long-term strategy. The state must commit to periodic review, and revision if appropriate,of the SIP on a schedule not less frequent than every three years. At thetime of the periodic review, a report must be developed in consultationwith the FLM's and submitted to the Administrator and to the public. Thereport must contain an assessment of the following: 1. The progress achieved in remedying existing impairment of visibilityin any mandatory Class I federal area; 2. The ability of the long-term strategy to prevent future impairment ofvisibility in any mandatory Class I federal area; 3. Any change in visibility since the last such report, or in the caseof the first report, since plan approval; 4. Additional measures, including the need for SIP revisions, that maybe necessary to assure reasonable progress toward the national visibilitygoal; 5. The progress achieved in implementing BART and meeting other schedulesset forth in the long-term strategy; 6. The impact of any exemption granted under section 51.303; and 7. The need for BART to remedy existing visibility impairment of any integralvista listed in the plan since the last such report, or, in the case ofthe first report, since plan approval. <ITAG tagnum="85">Kentucky's Plan for Protection of Visibility in Class I Areas (PartII) </ITAG>The Kentucky Plan is divided into four main sections as follows:<ITAG tagnum="15">1. Necessity for Plan </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">2. General Plan Requirements </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">3. Periodic Review </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">4. Conclusion</ITAG>Section 1 (Necessity for Plan) identifies the purpose and goal of the visibilityplan. It identifies the mandatory Class I area located in the State (MammothCave National Park), as well as the Class I area located in Missouri (MingoWilderness Refuge) that may be affected by sources in Kentucky. Kentucky'splan also identifies the pollutants most involved in visibility impairment_sulfurdioxide, oxides, particulate matter, and ozone. Section 2 (General Plan Requirements) is divided into four parts as follows:Part (a) (Consultation with Federal Land Managers) provides that Kentuckyhas met all of the Federal Land Manager coordination requirements as requiredin 40 CFR 51.302. Kentucky notified the appropriate FLM's for the affectedClass I areas via correspondence dated July 13, 1987 (copies included inAppendix A of the plan). The FLM's were also contacted by phone on June23, 1987, to notify them that Kentucky was developing a visibility SIPand to afford them an opportunity to identify any visibility impairment.Kentucky further states that the FLM's can certify the source-specificimpairment(s) of Class I areas at any time. Part (b) (Assessment of Visibility Impairments) provides that no sourcesin the Commonwealth have been identified as causing source-specific visibilityimpairment in either the Mammoth Cave or the Mingo Wilderness area. Also,the National Park Service has not identified any integral vistas for anyof the Class I areas in Kentucky or Missouri. Part (c) (Emission Controls Representing Best Available Retrofit Technology)provides that since no existing sources have been identified to negativelyimpact visibility, the implementation of BART is not required at this time.Also, if any source-specific impairment is identified, then Kentucky'splan will be adjusted to develop necessary regulatory authority to implementBART, and to set emission limitations and compliance schedules representingBART.Part (d) (Long-term Emission Control Strategy)_Kentucky lists the six (6)SIP factors required by 40 CFR 51.306(e). Kentucky then states that sincethere is no identified impairment due to ``plume blight'' in either ClassI area potentially affected by Kentucky sources, the Cabinet feels thatthe long-term strategy need not address the following topics:1. Additional emission limitations and schedules for compliance;2. Source retirement and replacement schedules; and3. Enforceability of emission limitations and control measures.Kentucky has provided discussions regarding the three remaining SIP factorsrequired by 40 CFR 51.306(e). These are as follows:1. Emission reduction due to ongoing air pollution control programs_Kentuckyhas a number of regulations to control emissions from major industrialsources to achieve, to maintain, and to enhance the quality of the ambientair in the Commonwealth, including its PSD, Nonattainment NSR, and itsregulations for existing and new process operations. Kentucky feels thatthese regulations are adequate for the control of emissions from new andexisting sources to achieve the national goal.2. Measures to mitigate the impacts of construction activities_Kentuckystates that no construction activity or practice in the Commonwealth hasbeen identified to negatively impact the air quality of any Class I area.However, the State regulation for the control of fugitive particulate matter(dust) emissions (401 KAR 63.010) prohibits fugitive emissions of particulatesfrom activities such as material handling operations and construction.Kentucky feels that this State regulation is adequate to achieve the nationalgoal.3. Smoke Management Techniques_Kentucky regulates open burning (401 KAR63.005). Kentucky states that ``Although the provisions of this regulationexempt fires set for recognized agricultural, silvicultural, range, andwild life management practices, there is no present indication that openburning in Kentucky for those purposes are impairing visibility in eitherof the potentially affected Class I areas.'' Kentucky feels that the Stateregulation on open burning is adequate to achieve the national goal.Section 3 (Periodic Review)_The final portion of Kentucky's long-term strategyinvolves the State's requirement to periodically review and revise (asappropriate) the long-term strategy, and to prepare a report to the Administratorand to the public. EPA commented to the State that the plan did not statewith sufficient clarity Kentucky's intentions with respect to the reportingrequirements. In response, Kentucky on October 9, 1987, submitted to EPAa letter of clarification regarding its intentions with respect to theperiodic reporting requirements of 40 CFR 51.306(c). This letter clearedup any ambiguity that might have existed in the visibility plan. Therefore,Kentucky has fully met the requirements for a long-term strategy, includingthose pursuant to andSection; 51.306(c).Section 4 (Conclusion) presents the State's overall view regarding theirvisibility plan and states that ``since no source-specific impairment(s)has been identified in any designated Class I areas, the Cabinet feelsthat this plan is adequate to protect visibility in Class I areas.''<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Action</ITAG>After reviewing Kentucky's plan for the protection of visibility in ClassI areas (Part II), EPA finds that the plan satisfies all of the remainingrequirements of the visibility regulations specified in the second partof the settlement agreement. EPA is therefore approving the visibilityplan submitted by the Commonwealth of Kentucky on August 31, 1987.EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agencyviews this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments.This action will be effective September 12, 1988, unless, within 30 daysof its publication, notice is received that adverse or critical commentswill be submitted.If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effectivedate by publishing two subsequent notices. One notice will withdraw thefinal action and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposalof the action and establishing a comment period. If no such comments arereceived, the public is advised that this action will be effective September12, 1988.Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this SIP revision will not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.(See 46 FR 8709).The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof Section 3 of Executive Order 12291.Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of thisaction must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriatecircuit by September 12, 1988. This action may not be challenged laterin proceedings to enforce its requirements.
