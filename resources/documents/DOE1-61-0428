In other words, a tip of an ultrasonic tool, which is connectedwith an ultrasonic vibrator, is contacted on a working surface eitherof thin semiconductor film or alloy layer which are laminated on theplural number of transparent electrodes, and is relatively moved againstthe working surface to cut it; accurate cutting is possible without influencingthe lower layer of the working layer.
