The Dow Jones Industrial Average is the best-known stock market indicator, but when it finally closed above its 1987 pre-crash record yesterday, it was the last major stock indicator to climb to a new high.    In recent months, other market indicators have upstaged the Dow Jones industrials by smashing the records they set two years ago, before the market began the sickening decline that culminated in the Oct. 19 crash. The American Stock Exchange index was the first to surpass its pre-crash record, when it closed at 366 June 8; the previous record was 365.01 Aug. 13, 1987.    About two months after the new Amex record, three other major indexes hit records in rapid succession. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index and the New York Stock Exchange composite index did the trick July 26, when the Sandamp;P closed at 338.05 and the Big Board composite at 188.14. Then, on Aug. 3, the Nasdaq index of over-the-counter stocks finished at 456.93, surpassing its previous high of 455.26 Aug. 26, 1987.    The industrials' new record comes at a bad time for superstitious traders. Today, Aug. 25, is the two-year anniversary of when the average hit its old 2722.42 record in pre-crash 1987. The rest is history. </TEXT></DOC>
