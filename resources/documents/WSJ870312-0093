The limited partnership said a lender, which it didn't identify, agreed to reduce the interest rate on a $1.7 million loan on one of its Houston properties and extend the maturity date of the loan one year to April 1, 1988. In other talks with lenders, the company said it is seeking partial debt service moratoriums.    Southwest, however, declined to elaborate on the amount of debt under discussion or how many lenders are involved. It characterizered the talks with lenders as &quot;preliminary to tentative.&quot;    The partnership said if the negotiations aren't successful it could lose &quot;one or more&quot; of the three properties whose debt it is trying to restructure. Southwest said it could continue to meet its monthly debt obligations in 1987 but added that such payments &quot;would probably severely impair&quot; its liquidity and restrict its ability to maintain the quality of its properties.    John S. Schneider, Southwest's general partner, said the discussions center on two Houston apartment properties and one San Antonio apartment property, all of which required &quot;a significant infusion of capital&quot; last year. He said that depending on the success of the restructuring effort, Southwest may seek to restructure debt on two more properties. </TEXT></DOC>
