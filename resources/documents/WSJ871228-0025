The currency fell as low as 123.30 yen in early dealings despite the Bank of Japan's reported buying of dollars. The unit, however, subsequently was quoted at 123.65 yen in midmorning trading.    Traders said the dollar's fall since late last week was prompting Japanese exporters to sell dollars aggressively to hedge the risk of further currency-exchange losses on their dollar-denominated export earnings.    The Tokyo stock market opened sharply lower Monday in thin trading in response to the dollar's continued decline, but ended slightly up at the end of the day's trading. The 225-stock Nikkei rose 30.56 points to close at 21564.00. The average had fallen 422.43 points Friday and 587.50 points Saturday.    In late New York trading Thursday, the dollar was quoted at 125.82 Japanese yen, compared with 126.64 late Wednesday.    A spate of last-minute interbank selling in Tokyo Friday sent the dollar as low as 125.10 yen. Continued selling by Japanese banks, insurance companies and investment houses was cited as the U.S. currency reached a low of 124.75 yen in Bahrain early Saturday, when nearly all European and U.S. traders were on the sidelines.    Dealers said the Japanese institutions were positioning themselves for the coming week, which some said could see the dollar drop to about 120 yen.    The Bank of Japan intervened modestly in support of the dollar early Friday, currency market sources said, then quit the market, a change from its usual strategy of intervening late in the session to help the dollar off its lows. </TEXT></DOC>
