NBC Sports executive producer Michael Weisman confirmed that theplan had been presented to certain advertisers and said some haveindicated interest, the Daily News reported.   Under the plan, unprecedented in Olympic coverage, NBC wouldsuperimpose a silent picture in the lower-righthand corner of thetelevision screen during commercials in sports such as basketball,volleyball, cycling and long-distance track events. The sport wouldoccupy one-quarter of the television screen.   NBC is hoping to avoid the harsh viewer criticism ABC wassubjected to during this year's Winter Olympics, when goals werescored during commercial breaks of hockey telecasts. NBC hasexperimented with the technique during telecasts of major-leaguebaseball games.   ``Some of these athletes have worked a lifetime to get to theOlympics,'' said Weisman, speaking from Seoul, where the Olympicsbegin later this week. ``It would be a shame if a great performancewasn't seen by the home folks because we were in a commercialbreak.''   Advertisers are paying NBC up to $330,000 for a 30-secondcommercial.   Weisman said advertisers should consider the ``good-will'' valueof consenting to the proposal.   ``Viewers will appreciate the gesture and so will theathletes,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
