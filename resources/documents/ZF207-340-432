 But as networks continue to proliferateand as the number of queues grows, this task becomes progressively moretime-consuming and burdensome.andM;A more efficient approach would be to give users more responsibility forqueue management, freeing the system manager to attend to more pressingconcerns.andP;  Unfortunately, complex DCL commands and special privilegerequirements have effectively prevented system managers from implementingthis solution.andM;Data Center Software has overcome these obstacles with Queman, a softwarepackage that allows system managers to decentralize queue-managementfunctions without sacrificing VMS security.andP;  Queman is a menu-drivenimplementation that supports a maximum of 500 queues and functions in aVAXcluster environment.andM;Through Queman's screens and menus, users can monitor all types of VAX batchand output queues--execution, generic and logical--as well as manipulateindividual jobs.andP;  If users have been granted Queman system manager access,they can also initialize, delete and modify queues.andM;With the help of a User Access Table (UAT), system managers can specify theextent and type of access to be given to various users and then save thesesettings.andP;  For example, system managers can give full print- and batch-queueprivileges to some users and provide others with more restricted access toqueues and queue commands.andM;INSTALLATIONandM;Queman version 4.0 requires VMS version 4.6 or higher and at least 600 blocksof disk space.andP;  It is installed using the VMSINSTAL command procedure andcreates four files: QMAN040.EXE,QUSE040.EXE, QKEY.DAT and QUSE.DAT.andP;  Itsinstallation does not update any DCL tables or create any system logicals.andM;Once Queman is installed, the system manager can use the Queusr utility(invoked by running the program QUSE040.EXE) to access the UAT and createindividual records.andP;  These records contain the information that Queman usesto determine the type of queue access that will be given to each user.andM;By default, the UAT uses a &quot;wildcard&quot; record that grants a wide range ofqueue privileges.andP;  After the system manager runs the Queusr program, thisUSER_WILDCARD record appears on the terminal screen along with a menu ofchoices at the bottom.andP;  System managers should first choose Delete from themenu to erase the wildcard record.andM;Next, one or more new records must be created to allow users to access theQueman utility itself.andP;  Each record is identified by a key.andP;  The systemmanager chooses the appropriate Queman privileges--such as Batch Manager,Output Manager, Forms Manager and System Manager--to assign to each record(Fig.andP;  1).andP;  When these privileges are enabled, they appear as options inqueman's Main Menu.andM;In the Queue List box, the system manager can specify one or more queue namesor use the wildcard specifications *BATCH and *OUTPUT to designate all batchand print queues on the system.andP;  The system manager can then choose whichqueue and job commands to associate with the current record.andP;  These selectedcommands, like the selected privileges, appear as Queman menu options.andM;A system manager can also list as many as 100 form names (in the Forms List)for each record.andP;  A wildcard designation, *FOORMS, can be used to enter allforms.andM;Finally, the system manager can restrict access to Queman by creating andenabling a Records Access List (RAL).andP;  By entering as many as 45 VAXusernames into the RAL, the system manager can restrict Queman access todesignated users--an important feature for security-conscious managers.andP;  Ifthe RAL feature is not enabled, acces sto the Queman record is granted to allusers who know the correct record key.andM;After a record has been created it can be saved by pressing the PF1 key.andO;They system manager can then exist from the Queusr utility by selecting theExit option at the menu.andM;USER GET INTO THE ACTandM;Users can access Queman as soon as the UAT is established.andP;  Queman can beinvoked from the DCL prompt by entering the command QUEMAN followed by arecord key name that corresponds to a key name in the UAT.andP;  For example,typing the foreign symbol QUEMAN/KEY=ALL invokes Queman using the UAT recordcalled ALL.andP;  If the RAL is enabled for that record, Queman will validate theusername and then grant access.andP;  IF the username is invalid, Queman will notallow access.andM;If the user invokes Queman using a record that is fully enabled, Queman willpresent a top-level menu consisting of six choices: Batch Queue Manager,Output Queue Manager, Forms Manager, System Manager, User Defaults and Exit.andO;Some of these menu choices will be absent if the user accesses a record fromthe UAT that doesn't grant all of these privileges.andM;The Batch Queue Manager and the Output Queue Manager options provideinterfaces to the VAX queues.andP;  They use a series of screens--including a mainscreen (Fig.andP;  2), a detailed queue screen, a &quot;zoom&quot; batch job screen and adetailed batch job screen--to display information about batch queues andassociated jobs.andM;By pressing the letter B at the main menu, a user can access the Batch QueueManager main screen.andP;  This screen lists information about the system's batchqueues, including the name of the node on which the queue was initialized,the current queue status and the number of exeucting jobs.andM;A Queue Commands menu at the bottom of the Batch Queue Manager main screenallows the user to control selected queues.andP;  A user can select a queue bypressing the up or down arrow keys or using Queman's keypad directional keys.andO;The user can then choose a queue command from the Queue Commands menu toperform an operation on the selected queue.andP;  The menu allows users to start,stop, merge and reset queues.andM;The Queue Commands menu also provides Asgn (Assign) and DeAsgn (Deassign)options.andP;  The Asgn option allows users to redirect logical queues or genericqueues to specific execution queues (queues that execute jobs).andP;  A genericqueue can be linked to a maximum of 12 queues, whereas a logical queue can belinked to only one queue.andP;  This limitation originates in VMS.andP;  The DeAsgnoption erases an established relationship.andM;Generic queues are particularly useful in environments that support manyqueues.andP;  A batch generic queue can efficiently distribute jobs among severaldifferent execution queues, reducing the likelihood of time-consumingbacklogs.andM;Selecting the InDt (In Detail) option at the Queue Commands menu allows theuser to view detailed information about the selected queue.andP;  (To change anyof these parameters, the user must access other Queman screens and menus.)andO;This option enables the user to verify the protection values that have beenset for the queue, the current status of the queue, the queue's defaultpriority and the flag settings.andP;  By pressing the Next Screen key, users cancheck for target queues (if the queue is generic or logical) and look at asmany as 12 selected characteristics for the queue.andM;ZOOM SCREENandM;A third display, the Batch Queue Zoom display, provides information aboutselected queues and their respective jobs.andP;  The user can select jobs and usethe Job Commands menu to perform operations on them.andP;  Users can delete thejobs, move them, place them in a holding state or change their priorities.andO;Users can still perform queue operations through the Queue Commands menu.andO;The user can return to the Queue Commands menu at any time to perform queueoperations.andM;Using the InDt menu option, the user can also take a detailed look at anindividual job.andP;  The detailed batch job screen shows the job name, entrynumber owner, current status (executing, holding, aborting), and job processinformation, including the number of activated images, the number of filesopened by the created process, page faults and I/O counts.andP;  Although some ofthis information is a bit more than most users need, system managers willappreciate the ability to quickly display and examine this information.andM;The Output Queue Manager works much like its batch queue counterpart.andP;  Usingthe Output Queue Manager display screens, users can view and control outputqueues.andP;  The main display lists output queues and the status of each of thesequeues, the form that is currently mounted, and the number of jobs that arecurrently on each of these queues.andM;From this main screen, the user can move to a detailed, three-page display ofa selected output queue by choosing InDt from the menu.andM;The first page provides useful information about queue settings and status,such as the UIC of the queue owner, the device attached to the queue,protection values, the maximum and minimum job sizes, and the currentlymounted form (Fig.andP;  3).andP;  The second screen shows which queue flags areenabled, and the third screen shows queue characteristics and, if the queueis generic, any target queues.andM;The Output Queue Zoom screen provides a listing of all of the job names alongwith the username, entry number, block size, status and mounted form (Fig.andO;4).andP;  The Job Commands menu allows users to delete, move, hold, stop and startjobs.andM;The Job Commands menu also provides a Form option, which allows users tochange the form setting for a specific job.andP;  With this option, users can callup predefined forms to print many forms, such as checks and invoices, withoutbothering the system operator or manager.andM;The detailed Job screen provides information about specific output jobs.andO;Using this screen, users can verify the form settings and check for operatorrequests (Fig.andP;  5).andM;The Forms Manager provides a useful way to create or modify output queueforms.andP;  Rather than fumbling around with cumbersome DCL commands andparameters, users can easily view and manipulate output queue forms viaeasy-to-use screens and menus.andM;The Forms Manager display provides a description of the form and a list ofits margin and flag settings.andP;  The Form Commands menu provides options tomodify or delete existing form settings and allows users to create customizedforms, such as mailing labels.andM;If the System Manager option has been enabled in the UAT record, users canperform system-level queue operations.andP;  However, system managers should becautious when granting this privilege because it allows users to initialize(create), modify or delete queues.andM;While we were testing the System Manager option, we discovered oneshortcoming: There is no menu option to search for a specific queue.andP;  Thisomission can prove particularly inconvenient in an environment that supportsmany queues.andP;  For example, a user who needs to modify a queue called ZPRINTwill have to move one queue at a time (using the Next menu option) untilZPRINT comes up on the screen.andP;  In a system with several hundred queues, thisprocess could become quite tiresome.andP;  Data Center Software said it plans toadd a search feature to this menu in a future release of the product.andM;Queman's system Manager option can also be used to define or modify as manyas 127 characteristics to be used by queues and jobs.andP;  Once a characteristicis defined, it can be assigned to various queues.andP;  Jobs submitted withspecific characteristic parameters will only execute on a queue if thecharacteristic settings match.andM;Within the System Manager menu of choices is a Queue Manager option thatallows the user to start or stop the VAX Queue Mnager.andP;  Unfortunately,neither of these options will work unless the user's account has SYSNAMprivileges.andM;Finally, the top-leverl menu choice, User Defaults, allows users to setcertain Queman options.andP;  Users can change the seconds-per-cycle setting thatdetermines how often Queman is updated when it is in Monitor mode.andP;  Bydefault, this value is set to three seconds.andP;  Users can also change thesubprocess prompt that is used when spawning a subprocess from Queman.andP;  Bydefault, the prompt is set to QUEMANandgt;.andM;By pressing the PF2 key, users can get a one-screen display that lists all ofQueman's special keys.andP;  Pressing andless;Controlandgt; A allows users to &quot;auto zoom&quot; to aspecified queue; andless;Controlandgt; B lets users read system messages that werebraodcase during the Queman session; andless;Controlandgt; U returns users to the mainmenu; and andless;Controlandgt; J spawns a subprocess from within Queman.andM;SOMEBODY HELP!andM;Like many superheroes, Queman has an Achilles heel.andP;  The product's weak linkis its documentation.andM;This vulnerability is particularly surprising in a product designed todistribute queue-management capabilities to the user masses.andP;  There is noon-line assistance, and the documentation doesn't do an adequate job ofexplaining the many parameters, flags and characteristics associated withqueues and jobs.andP;  Queman users may find themselves referring to DEC manualsfor assistance.andM;In spite of this shortcoming, Queman is a solid implementation of a grandidea.andP;  Although not necessarily a solution for small sites with few queues,it will prove its worth in larger environments.andP;  With Queman, users canassume more responsibility for managing their queues, allowing systemmanagers to focus their energies on more constructive projects.andM;QUEUE IT UPandM;Queues are simply lines, such as the line of customers waiting for service ina bank or at a movie theater.andP;  Similarly, VAX queues are simply lists ofprint and batch jobs awaiting execution.andM;VAX queue types can be either batch or output.andP;  Batch queues allow users toexecute programs without further user intervention, leaving the users free todo other tasks.andP;  These non-interactive processes can be run at lowerpriorities than interactive processes and will take little CPU time away frominteractive users.andP;  Batch queues are useful for running large programs onbusy systems.andM;Output queues control the execution of print jobs.andP;  They are usually printqueues (assigned to a specific printer device), but they can also be terminalqueues.andP;  When VAX users print files with the PRINT command, a print job issubmitted to an output queue.andP;  Unlike batch queues, output queues can onlyexecute one job at a time.andM;VAX/VMS queues can also be classified as execution, generic and logical.andP;  Anexecution queue controls batch or print job execution.andP;  Typically, jobs in anexecution queue are executed in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) manner.andM;Generic queues can be assigned to one or more execution queues.andP;  This type ofsetup is useful for efficiently distributing printing resources andpreventing backlogs.andP;  For instance, a generic output queue can be assigned tothree print queues of the same type.andP;  Print jobs are held in the genericqueue until one of the three execution queues becomes available.andM;Gneeric queues also allow queues to be shared among nodes in a VAXclusterenvironment.andP;  For instance, jobs submitted on one node can be routed throughgeneric queues to execution queues on another node in the VAXcluster.andM;Logical queues work much like generic queues, but they can only be assignedto a single output queue.andP;  Although not as  versatile as generic queues,logical queues are useful for quickly redirecting print jobs in case of aprinter breakdown.andM;Like VMS files, VAX queues adhere to a UIC- and ACL-based protection scheme.andO;By setting privilege restrictions on queues, system managers can restrict orlimit access to specific queues.andM;Queues can be set up with a variety of other attributes and characteristicsas well.andP;  For instance, output queues can be set up to reject jobs based ontheir size.andP;  Output queues can also be assigned specific form types, whichinclude information about paper stock type and print job processingattributes.andP;  Form type settings allow queues to be used for special tasks,such as printing mailing labels or paychecks.andM;In addition, attributes can be associated with batch queues.andP;  For instance,CPU limits, job limits and base priorities can be specified.andP;  The job limitis the maximum number of jobs that can execute simultaneously, and the CPUlimit is the maximum CPU time that a single job can use.andP;  Once a batch issubmitted to a queue, it assumes the queue's base priority setting and thenexecutes according to this priority level.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
