Slices were irradiatedwith a cobalt-60 source and compared to paired, sham-irradiated controls.Electrophysiological activity in the CA1 population of pyramidal cellswas evoked by stimulation of the stratum radiatum. Analysis of the somaticand dendritic responses suggested sites of radiation damages. Orthodromaticallyevoked activity was significantly decreased in slices receiving greaterthan 75-Gy gamma radiation. The effects were dose and dose-rate dependent.At 20 Gy/min, doses of 50 Gy and greater produced synaptic impairmentwhile doses of 75 Gy and greater also produced postsynaptic damage (i.e.,the ability of the synaptic response to generate an action potential).A lower dose rate, 5 Gy/min, reduced the sensitivity of synaptic damageto radiation exposure; synaptic impairment required a dose of 100 Gyor greater at the lower dose rate. In contrast, postsynaptic damage wasnot sensitive to dose rate. This study demonstrates that ionizing radiationcan directly affect the integrated functional activity of neurons.</TEXT></DOC>
