Sterba</HL><DD> 06/19/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><DATELINE> NARITA, Japan  </DATELINE><TEXT>   I've always been quietly chauvinistic about my nation's currency. It made me feel good, secretly, that the Viet Cong wanted dollars during the war more than they wanted piasters, or dong, or even francs.    I could swagger up to a money changer anywhere in Asia, plunk down a trusty greenback, and bathe in the courtesy and attentiveness my money mustered. The house abacus would be launched into its elegant tap dance, and presto: One of mine always seemed to net a bundle of theirs.    My bills were dull green and all the same size, but portraits of rather stern gentlemen stared up at the money changer as if to say, &quot;This is the right stuff, pal.&quot; (Which, incidently, is why I could imagine, say, a Volcker dollar but not a Nixon, Ford, Carter or Reagan dollar.) Anyway, what I usually got in return was paper in various colors and sizes, sometimes adorned with etchings of peasants in rice fields, or water buffalo.    My money was a perk for being an American, and it greased many a passage through the Orient. Then I came here, to Tokyo's international airport, with seven hours to kill thanks to the scheduling geniuses at Northwest Orient Airlines. One look at the exchange rate -- 137.75 yen to the dollar -- and I concluded that humility was near and that I was about to make a personally major contribution to the trade deficit. I changed a C-note for a couple of pieces of brown paper and some coins. No bundles here, although there were a lot of zeros on the yen notes.    Anyone who has transited at Narita knows two things: Going to downtown Tokyo takes too long and costs too much unless you have about 48 hours, but waiting around in the Narita international transit lounge, with its crowds, backless seats and four-in-the-morning ambiance, is murder.    I opted to go through immigration and customs and into the main section of the airport. This took an hour and 45 minutes, the first part of which involved standing in a long queue in front of a sign that read not &quot;Foreigners&quot; or &quot;Nonresidents,&quot; but &quot;Aliens.&quot; I passed the time thinking about Sigourney Weaver. Visaless, the immigration man eventually stamped &quot;shore leave&quot; on my transit pass, thus waiving the $14.52 airport departure tax; the customs woman waved me through; and for a fixed fee of $2.90 a porter rolled my two bags to a storage room where, for $4.36, they were looked after. Not so bad.    Before plunging into a major reconnaissance, I bought an Asahi Evening News for 87 cents and boarded an escalator for Cafe Toyosaki, one flight up. There, for $3.27, I was provided with a bottle of Kirin beer and a tiny table overlooking the south-wing arrival lobby I had just traversed. It was pleasant enough, until I noticed that I could look out above the arrival lobby through a glass wall and see the long queue in front of the &quot;Aliens&quot; sign again, which turned my attention back to Ms. Weaver.    I like Narita's layout: two compact, multistory wings, with relatively short corridors leading to the planes. It isn't a jumble of different buildings like JFK in New York, and you don't have to walk endless miles as in O'Hare in Chicago. Its workers are dauntingly efficient and invariably polite. Security seems tight. It just isn't a very comfortable place.    After calling the Tokyo office (the phone quickly ate five 100-yen coins ($3.63), I went window shopping for lunch. The Keisei restaurant on the departure-lounge floor offered hot dogs for $5.81, french fries for $2.90, a green salad for $3.63, bread and butter (or steamed rice) for $1.45 and coffee for $2.18.    At the Avion restaurant, I could purchase a club sandwich for $7.26, pie a la mode for $5.08, a Coke for $2.54, or a large draft beer for $5.81. These are Waldorf prices -- at least Waldorf coffee-shop prices.    One flight above the departure lounge was the Big Boy restaurant, featuring a $7.26 cheeseburger and a $6.17 tuna-fish sandwich. I've paid that much for a cheeseburger in New York, but a lot of atmosphere came with it or else Woody Allen and Mia Farrow were sitting at the next table. Or else I was being ripped off and everybody knew it. I got the feeling, however, that the people inside the Big Boy didn't think $6.17 was a lot for a tuna-fish sandwich. Since they all seemed to be Japanese, they weren't thinking in dollars anyway. They were thinking 850 yen -- peanuts.    Anyway, I ended up at the Yama restaurant and ate shredded pork for $14.52, fried rice for $6.53 and iced tea for $2.54. Small portions.    With four more hours to burn, I thought about getting a haircut. But when I found the barbershop, its sign read &quot;regular cut, 3,000 yen.&quot; That's $21.78, and since the man with the scissors bore no resemblance to Kenneth, I pushed on.    Down in the basement, I found a medical clinic that would check me out and provide medicine for a set fee of 4,000 yen, or $29.04, or give me a vaccination for 2,000 yen, or $14.52. But I needed neither. The basement, however, held my first sight of bargains. A small grocery store there was bustling with customers: men in coveralls, women in Avis uniforms, and other airport workers. Sure, an apple cost $2.90, but a banana was going for only 36 cents, and a can of Sapporo beer was only $1.56.    Similar prices and similar airport workers could also be found up on the observation-deck floor. Show your ticket and the hostess lets you in free. At little food and souvenir booths, a coke was only 83 cents, what had a vague resemblance to a hamburger went for $1.89, a bottle of Jandamp;B scotch was on sale for $29.04, and a bottle of Robert Mondavi white table wine seemed like a steal for only $8.71.    But I decided that this was my day of living dangerously, so I ventured back to the main-floor restaurant row for dinner and found a sushi bar that wasn't named in English and was crowded with Japanese but didn't seem to have any foreign customers. Various offerings were written in Japanese on little wooden boards and paper streamers, and spoken English seemed to be limited to &quot;thank you.&quot;    I ordered some hot sake, and before long was having a wonderful time watching the chef prepare little sushi bundles and rolls for everyone else. When he concocted something that appealed to me, I'd motion from my end of the bar, he'd snap off a crisp &quot;Hai&quot; and before long I'd get some too.    The sake was tummy-warming and restful. The raw tuna, broiled eels, dancing shrimp and other delicacies kept coming. A good time seemed to be had by all, and soon came the bill: 12,600 yen, or $91.47. I, of course, didn't have that much yen. But they politely accepted my credit card.    ---   Mr. Sterba is a senior special writer for the Journal. </TEXT></DOC>
