Proudfoot serves as a hatchet man for big corporations -- Citicorp, Amoco Corp., New York Life Insurance Co. and Clark Equipment Co., to name a few. No other big management consulting firm is remotely like it.    While firms such as McKinsey andamp; Co. and Booz Allen andamp; Hamilton Inc. politely talk strategic five-year plans, Proudfoot stalks the shop floor, cutting one worker from the mail room, 20 from accounting, and 400 from data processing. Using a technique refined from turn-of-the-century time and motion studies -- and a &quot;.45-to-the-temple&quot; approach, as one former executive puts it -- Proudfoot often leaves behind a more productive, though somewhat shell-shocked, work force.    Proudfoot's other traits are equally idiosyncratic. Competitors recruit from top business schools; Proudfoot uses the want ads. Other consultants advise and then often leave; Proudfoot always sticks around to implement its recommendations. Other consultants maintain big offices in business centers such as New York, Chicago and Los Angeles; Proudfoot's top officers are based in Palm Beach, Fla., in part because a former chairman is a croquet fanatic. The firm's 1,000 or so consultants all work out of their homes, scattered around the country and overseas.    Proudfoot's aggressive sales tactics and a track record that includes some botched jobs have given it a grubby image in the business community. Still, the firm thrives by handling a task many executives shrink from -- namely, wholesale personnel cuts. That skill has been in keen demand during the 1980s, as relatively low inflation and increased global competition force many companies to seek cost cuts rather than price rises to bolster profits. In 1987, Proudfoot had billings of $150.9 million and profit of $42 million before taxes, making it the 17th largest management consulting firm in the world and one of the more profitable.    An executive at one of the Midwest's biggest industrial companies glowingly describes how Proudfoot helped him trim about 400 workers from a 1,700-person data processing and computer center. But he agrees to talk only on the condition that he and his company not be named. He says he isn't sure the remaining workers have gotten over the experience yet.    Proudfoot also helped find big labor savings at New York Life and Aon Corp. Both insurers say they probably couldn't have eliminated as many workers without the firm's help, though they decline to say how many jobs they cut. But bad memories still linger. &quot;Do you ever get rid of the trauma?&quot; asks Judie Cromie, a former Proudfoot consultant who now oversees cost-cutting at Aon. &quot;No, you don't.&quot;    Proudfoot's methods have left other clients reeling, too. The firm's &quot;mind control techniques&quot; led to &quot;mistrust, anxiety and antagonism,&quot; among workers at Storwall International Inc., the Toronto filing-cabinet maker charged in a lawsuit. It says that when it hired Proudfoot in 1984, it was promised millions of dollars in savings and a 43% increase in output. Instead, it says, production fell and costs ballooned.    Proudfoot asserts in court papers that Storwall kept it from implementing needed changes, and it says it did a good job. Thomas J. Huhn, Proudfoot's president and chief executive, won't comment on the matter, but he makes no apologies for his firm. &quot;We're proud of this damned company,&quot; he says.    Long a secretive partnership, Proudfoot now aims to muscle its way toward the top of the consulting industry. It has the financial backing of a big British investment firm, MIM Britannia Ltd. and went public last year. It used the $221 million in proceeds to buy out a handful of older partners. Alexander Proudfoot PLC, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, is currently looking for other consulting firms to acquire to broaden its practice.    It also is testing new territory: It recently took on some high-profile public-sector consulting jobs, though with mixed results. The city of Atlanta, for instance, wasn't quite ready for the firm's full measure. For citizens who don't pay their water bill, Proudfoot recommended the city first cut off their water, then auction off their homes if the homeowners didn't repent. Atlanta didn't take that advice.    Washington University in St. Louis hired Proudfoot last year to improve efficiency at its library. But the firm's touch proved a bit too rough. The library dean quit in protest of proposed staff cuts and reassignments. After a few weeks, the consulting firm's changes were rescinded. &quot;When you go into the academic arena, as well as state and local government,&quot; says Mr. Huhn, &quot;it's a hell of a lot more difficult.&quot;    The firm was founded in 1946 by Chicagoan Alexander Proudfoot. He recruited several young managers from the mail-order business, notably Montgomery Ward andamp; Co., where a productivity technique known as short-interval scheduling was used. In essence, it involves two things. First, watch a worker for an hour, say, to see how much he can do. Multiply by eight for an honest day's work. And keep an eye on him at short intervals forever after so he doesn't slack off.    Second, schedule the work flow to make sure the worker has enough to keep him busy. Get the whole crew doing this, and you can make do with a lot fewer people, or handle a lot more work. Proudfoot calls it &quot;productivity enhancement.&quot;    Mr. Proudfoot's genius was in deciding that the technique was applicable beyond the mail-order business. The firm branched out from distributors to manufacturers, grew steadily, and expanded overseas in the 1970s. More recently, it has helped what it calls white-collar &quot;paper mills,&quot; that is, insurance companies and big banks, streamline their huge processing operations.    Proudfoot has been trying to enhance its less-than-wholesome reputation with lots of image-enhancing advertisements in this and other business publications, but it is proving a tough job. &quot;We were branded for years,&quot; says Mr. Huhn (pronounced Hoon). &quot;When I first started, I'd slip through the airport, afraid some guy from Booz Allen would see me and want to look under my fingernails.&quot;    Mr. Huhn helped build up Proudfoot's overseas business and, when time came for the old guard to retire last year, he emerged as Proudfoot's new leader. The son of a Fort Wayne, Ind. tool maker, he was born weighing 14 pounds, and at age 52 is a hulking man, blunt and gruff. An item of interest in Proudfoot's litigation with a former employee is a tape recording of Mr. Huhn insisting in very adult language that a subordinate sign an agreement not to compete with Proudfoot. &quot;I want that {expletive} signed by midnight tomorrow,&quot; he says on the tape. &quot;I'm tired of all these {expletive} greedy {expletive} out there.&quot; In an interview, Mr. Huhn says, &quot;I may use some tough words. That doesn't bother me.&quot;    When Mr. Huhn talks business, his hypotheticals are meat markets and machine shops, not Fortune 500 companies. And there isn't a hint of business-school jargon as he tries to describe what his firm actually does: &quot;I'm not saying this right. But how you get people to change is a series of little confrontations, but in a positive way. We get people to do what they don't know how to do or don't want to do.&quot;    The Proudfoot regimen of constant travel, long hours, and forcing often-draconian measures on a frightened work force imposes a discipline on those who can take it. Many can't. Turnover runs more than 50% annually. &quot;It's the boot camp of business -- an excellent foundation for a young person,&quot; says Herbert H. Pratt, a former Proudfoot consultant.    &quot;If they'd asked me to walk through a wall, I would've done it,&quot; says Louis De Wolff, who quit Proudfoot in 1987 after 15 years. &quot;It was almost a cult. You either believed or you didn't. You were in or out.&quot; (Mr. De Wolff and Proudfoot are suing each other over his efforts to start his own consulting firm, and over the terms of his departure.)    The work implies a certain disdain for everyday managers. After all, why should it take a consultant to find fat in the payroll? &quot;Most guys who run a business aren't too bad,&quot; Mr. Huhn says. Running his finger down a typical organizational chart -- division manager, plant managers, superintendents and, finally, foremen -- he shakes his head. &quot;Where it starts breaking down is when things go down the pyramid. What starts out to be an apple ends up as fruit salad.&quot;    Getting a consulting job and then performing it is a three-part process at Proudfoot. Unlike other firms, where consultants sell their own services, Proudfoot has one staff for selling, one for analyzing what a client needs, and a third one for implementing the recommendations.    More than half its business comes from repeat customers or is referred by existing clients, Proudfoot says. To get the rest, the firm uses some of the most aggressive sales tactics in the business. &quot;They literally go around and knock on people's doors -- cold calls,&quot; says R. Larry Snider, the partner in charge of management consulting at Coopers andamp; Lybrand, a Big Eight accounting firm. &quot;We don't.&quot;    Proudfoot employs about 40 salesmen. Each pulls down a six-figure income or he doesn't last, says Allen Borucke, executive vice president in charge of sales. A salesman typically works with an assistant, who makes up to 100 phone calls a day trying to get through to chief executives. The pitch, a former salesman says: &quot;We can save you millions.&quot;    The former salesman describes his in-person pitch: &quot;You have to move these guys emotionally -- that you can fix a frustration he can't fix. Your company stinks. We know there's $20 million, $30 million, $40 million of recoverable waste in your organization. We can take 12% to 15% of your work force out. We would say the CEO could not trust his workers, or the data pumped up to him.&quot;    Adds Mr. Borucke: &quot;The buy is as much in the stomach as in the brain.&quot;    Proudfoot says it won't take on a job unless it can promise a client annual savings of at least three times the firm's fee, which runs close to $1 million on a typical job. If the executive bites, a team of Proudfoot consultants returns within days to begin a two-week analysis, which is free to the client. The consultants look for &quot;lost time&quot; in a company's work force, which Proudfoot contends is half a typical worker's day. &quot;All the {other} consultants work in that 50% where companies already utilize their resources,&quot; Mr. Huhn says. &quot;Proudfoot works in the waste area.&quot;    Proudfoot doesn't bill itself these days as a short-interval scheduling firm; it says its work is far broader and more sophisticated than that. It claims expertise in employee training, inventory control and timing, energy efficiency and computer systems. &quot;We're not just a head cutting outfit,&quot; says Nelson Henry, Proudfoot's executive vice president and chief operating officer.    But much of its work (and apparently some of its most successful jobs) remains in cutting labor costs through scheduling techniques. &quot;That's still their core technology,&quot; says George Bubrick, president of Brooks International Corp., a Montvale, N.J., competitor in the productivity field, &quot;no matter how aggressively they try to disguise it in their marketing.&quot;    Proudfoot itself is a good example of the profitability of controlling labor costs. Though experienced consultants oversee the implementing of its recommendations, much of the work is performed by &quot;green peas,&quot; low-ranking recent hires often trained on the job and paid about $25,000 a year. Proudfoot bills its U.S. clients $5,900 a week for each Proudfoot worker.    This arrangement has brought some big gripes from clients. Proudfoot used &quot;incompetent and unskilled&quot; people to implement changes, and it billed full rate for a student intern, Storwall charges. Proudfoot denies this.    &quot;Quite a few of the crew were on the job for the first time, I suspect,&quot; says Tecumseh Products Co.'s chief executive officer, Todd W. Herrick. He hired Proudfoot two years ago to reduce scrap and machinery breakdowns at the big Tecumseh, Mich., equipment maker. Instead, after eight months and hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees, things were much worse. &quot;It took me a year to get the plant back to where it was,&quot; Mr. Herrick says.    Mr. Huhn says Tecumseh has &quot;a tough union situation. It always makes it a little more difficult.&quot; He won't elaborate.    Commonly, Proudfoot leaves behind a happy chief executive and some enemies on the shop floor. &quot;We sell to the top,&quot; says Mr. Henry, &quot;but we work at the bottom.&quot;    A job that shows both the executive suite satisfaction and shop-floor terror is one Proudfoot did for Beneficial Standard Life Insurance Co. in 1981. (Beneficial is now a subsidiary of CalFed Inc., a financial-services concern based in Los Angeles. Beneficial's then president, Robert Lackey, hired Proudfoot because he felt the Los Angeles-based insurer's &quot;work standards were quite weak.&quot;    Proudfoot found waste, identified ways to streamline the flow of paper, and showed the company how to monitor production constantly. (Proudfoot says it stops short of telling companies exactly whom to fire, or doing the firing.)    Some workers, however, were terrified. &quot;It didn't take long to see these were hatchet people,&quot; says Edwin Fabiero, a former lower-level manager at Beneficial. The atmosphere &quot;was doom,&quot; he says, adding that workers were being clocked. &quot;They knew what was coming.&quot; Larry DuMouchel, another former manager, says he was told: &quot;Find the marginal performers, prepare a list, one out of four, and lay them off.&quot;    Silvia Sanchez came back from her afternoon break July 1, 1982, was called into an office, handed an envelope containing her last paycheck, and told to leave the building. &quot;I was totally devastated,&quot; says Ms. Sanchez, who worked her way up from typist to supervisor during 16 years at Beneficial. She lost weight, couldn't sleep, and didn't work again for six months. &quot;I couldn't stop crying,&quot; she recalls. &quot;I had worked very hard. I was in love with my job. Then they put me aside.&quot;    But Mr. Lackey says he was quite pleased with the results. By &quot;not necessarily doing the job better, but doing it faster,&quot; Beneficial was able to cut 20% of its employees, Mr. Lackey says. And that allowed him to weed out lollygaggers and troublemakers.    &quot;The naysayers are gone. The loyal and committed people are retained,&quot; he says, and Beneficial has saved more than $1 million a year as a result. </TEXT></DOC>
