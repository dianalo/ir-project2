Hilmes had asked official at the Army's major commandsearlier this year how their programs would be affected if spending on certainADP programs were stopped [GCN, Mary.andP;  19].andM;Although Hilmes now plans no moratorium, he said he has lowered from $50million to $10 million the threshold at which systems developed in the fieldmust be reviewed by senior Army officials.andM;&quot;We've told [field Army officers] about the need to eliminate duplication andthat the right business questions need to be asked&quot; before system aredeveloped, Hilmes said at a House subcommittee hearing this month.andM;Brig.andP;  Gen.andP;  Sam Leffler, Hilmes' deputy in the Office of the Director ofInformation Systems for Command, Control, Communications and Computers, spokeat an Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association conference inAlexandria, Va.andM;He explained that Hilmes had raised the moratorium question as part of theArmy's planning for how systems development might be affected by the DefenseDepartment's corporate information management (CIM) plan.andM;Under the CIM, DOD officials plan to consolidate the military services' andDOD agencies' major information systems into a unified architecture.andP;  Sevencategories of systems have been selected for CIM so far.andM;&quot;The moratorium idea was a shot downrange to the major commands to solicitsupport for how we will deal with CIM,&quot; Leffler said.andP;  &quot;We don't anticipate amoratorium.&quot;andM;It never was clear precisely what types of Army systems would have beenaffected by a moratorium.andM;In response to a reporter's query in March, Maj.andP;  Nancy Burt said anymoratorium would not affect the principal Armywide integration efforts beingdeveloped under such programs as the Reserve Component Automation System,Sustaining Base Information Services program, the Standard Army ManagementInformation Systems and the Standard Financial System Redesign.andM;Some officials said they believed Hilmes' moratorium idea was aimed at thesame information systems that he is overseeing more rigorously.andP;  Thesesmall-scale systems are developed in a command or other unit to support unitfunctions.andM;At the Capitol Hill hearing, Rep.andP;  Les AuCoin (D-Ore.) of the HouseAppropriations Subcommittee on Defense questioned Hilmes about whether fieldcommanders are resisting Army efforts to prevent further development ofunique systems.andM;Hilmes said he has not stopped any such projects but has &quot;restructured andreshaped some of them.&quot;andP;  He said field commanders &quot;have gotten the messageand thrown in their lot with us&quot; on the need to integrate systems.andM;In his speech in Alexandria, Leffler said Hilmes' moratorium query carriedcertain implications, including a need &quot;to get people to focus on using therequirements contracts we have for minis or micros.&quot;andM;CIM eventually will extend to the functions now supported by as many as 6,000systems, officials have said.andP;  Many of those systems were developed byindividual commands.andP;  Congress and the General Accounting Office havecriticized such systems as difficult to maintain, manage and connect orintegrate with other systems.andM;Cynthia Kendall, leader of the CIM effort and DOD's deputy comptroller forIRM, has said CIM was begun in part because of the congressional criticism.andM;In a recent inerview, Kendall emphasized that although service budgets havebeen cut in order to pay for CIM, the services are not under any directivesto cut certain systems.andM;&quot;But there is nothing that prevents the services from taking actions thatresult in savings,&quot; she said.andP;  She said she had not heard of the Hilmesmoratorium suggestion but added, &quot;It sounds like a reasonable thing for amanager to ask of his people.&quot;andM;Although they have backed away from a moratorium, Leffler said Army officialsare taking the CIM plan very seriously.andP;  &quot;We're all in this together,&quot; hesaid.andP;  &quot;CIM is going to get us where we have to go, which is down to commondata elements [across the services] and a standard data dictionary thateveryone can use.andM;&quot;CIM is real,&quot; Leffler said.andP;  &quot;Let there be no mistake about that.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
