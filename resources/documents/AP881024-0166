Soviet media have been restrained in reporting the dramaticeffort to free the two California grey whales, who were stranded inthe ice while trying to migrate south.   The news program, Vremya, told the story best with film of thecrystalline arctic scene where Eskimos were chain-sawing breathingholes in the ice for the mammals trying to migrate south.   It also showed one of the whales popping up for air in a channelcut in the ice, and provided a close-up of an ice-cutting tractorand of weights being dropped from a helicopter to crack the ice.   But the morning newspaper Pravda made no mention of the whales'situation, which has drawn worldwide attention. The afternoon paperIzvestia carried only a short item reporting that the Sovieticebreaking ships Admiral Makarov and Vladimir Arseniev couldarrive off the Alaskan coast as early as Monday evening to offerassistance.   Other Soviet newspapers do not publish on Monday.   Soviet help was requested because the United States did not havean icebreaker near the site, off Point Barrow.   The official news agency Tass noted in its report that whalesare an endangered species, or, in Soviet parlance, ``in the redbook'' that lists plants and animals with dangerously lowpopulations.   Neither Tass nor Izvestia mentioned that the Soviet Union huntedwhales until May 1987.   At the time, the Soviet Union was the world's second-largestwhaling nation. It halted its harvest only after the United Statesimposed sanctions by cutting in half the amount of fish the Sovietswere allowed to take from U.S. waters.   The Soviet Union then said it might resume whale-hunting in 1990if the population of the animals had risen sufficiently.   Many Soviets have embraced environmentalism with ferocity in thepast year, as the policy of glasnost, or openness, has allowedcitizens to protest the effects of years of industrial developmentthat ignored the ecology.   It is unclear whether the Soviet ships will arrive in time or domuch good because the ocean may be too shallow at the site of theice blockage.   ``Time is pressing,'' Izvestia said. ``The situation of thewhales is worsening in the eyes of the rescuers.''   Vremya was more optimistic, predicting the whales would soon beheading toward open water ``due to the efforts of people from bothcountries.''   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman saidMonday he believes the positive Soviet response to the U.S. requestis due more to the current spirit of goodwill and cooperationbetween the two nations than to the terms of a 1976 environmentalagreement betweem Washington and Moscow.</TEXT></DOC>
