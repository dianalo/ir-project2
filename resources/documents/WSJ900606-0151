The acquisition accord ends months of debate on thePhilips board over the company's course, following thecollapse earlier this year of a leveraged buy-out by MerrillLynch Capital Partners Inc.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There was a healthy discussion by the board whether tostay independent, do an LBO or sell to an industrialcompany,&quot; Gregory Hutchings, Tomkins's chief executiveofficer, said in London. In Dayton, Jesse Philips, thecompany's 75-year-old founder and retired chairman, said theboard voted unanimously to accept the Tomkins offer becauseit represented the &quot;best value&quot; for shareholders.   Last September, Merrill Lynch offered $25.50 a share forPhilips, a maker of windows, bathtubs, air-moving equipmentand other products, but was unable to line up financing forthe buy-out, even after Philips agreed to reduce the price to$24 a share. Further discussions failed to produce analternative transaction. Talks were initiated with Tomkinssoon after the Merrill Lynch buy-out collapsed last January,according to individuals involved in the negotiations.   The proposed price for Philips stock, though significantlylower than the initial $25.50-a-share buy-out proposal, is apremium of 32% above Monday's closing price of $14 a share incomposite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Yesterday,Philips stock surged $3.25 to close at $17.25 on volume of2,483,800 shares.   For London-based Tomkins, which already makes lawnmowers,bicycles and handguns in the U.S. as well as other metalproducts in Britain, the acquisition would be the biggest yetin a program to expand in the U.S. Tomkins was attracted toPhilips because it operates basic businesses involvingrelatively low-risk technology, said Richard G.G. Carr,president of Tomkins Corp., the U.S. subsidiary of TomkinsPLC.   In 1987, Tomkins bought Smith andamp; Wesson Corp., the gunmaker, for $112.5 million. The following year it boughtMurray Ohio Manufacturing Corp., a maker of lawnmowers andbicycles, for $224 million.   Acquisition of Philips would give Tomkins 66% of itsearnings from U.S. sources, according to Mr. Hutchings, upfrom 45% currently. &quot;Philips would be very similar to ourother U.S. acquisitions -- a company with low-risk, technicalproducts and good cash flow,&quot; he said.   Tim Harris, an analyst with Nomura Research Institute inLondon, predicted that Philips would add significantly toTomkins's already positive future earnings outlook.   Tomkins stock, though, slipped 14 pence (23.5 cents) to288 pence in late trading in London, reflecting concern overthe 58% dilution in the company's shares that would resultfrom the #320 million ($537.6 million) rights offering tofinance the acquisition. Tomkins conditioned its buy-outoffer on a successful underwriting of the rights offering.   If a definitive agreement hasn't been executed by theclose of business June 20, the agreement in principle willlapse, the companies said. And Philips is permitted todiscuss a merger with any other party that indicates aninterest prior to completion of the Tomkins transaction.   Philips was very successful until recently, acquiringcompanies in related industries and showing consistent profitgains by improving operations of the new businesses. However,the company reported a net loss of $14.6 million, or 51 centsa share, for the fiscal year ended March 31 because ofafter-tax charges totaling $51.3 million related to planneddisposition of three units and costs of the failed MerrillLynch buy-out. Sales were $927.5 million.</TEXT></DOC>
