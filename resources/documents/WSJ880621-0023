The United Food and Commercial Workers Union said it will recommend acceptance of the tentative agreement at a meeting &quot;in the coming days.&quot; The agreement was reached after several days of bargaining between the Montreal-based retail and real estate concern and the union. The talks resumed last week at the request of Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa.    The supermarket concern has said for several months it would sell its supermarkets in Quebec and Ontario if it couldn't get long-term &quot;labor peace&quot; with its major unions. The main Ontario union agreed to such a pact earlier this month, but Quebec workers rejected a package of wage concessions, prompting Steinberg to announce the closure of 10 of its more than 100 supermarkets in the province.    According to details of the proposed pact made public by the union, wage concessions won't be as severe as under the rejected agreement. In addition, full-time employees with over five years of service will be eligible for a voluntary buy-out package equivalent to 40 weeks of pay or 1,000 Canadian dollars (US$842) for each year of service.    Union officials said the cost of the concessions, in addition to the cost of the buy-outs, would be C$11 million a year compared with C$20 million originally demanded by Steinberg. Steinberg A stock closed yesterday at C$32.50 a share, off C$1.50, on the Toronto Stock Exchange.    Thomas Kukovica, executive assistant to the union's Canadian president, told a news conference that if union members accept the agreement, Steinberg has agreed not to sell a core of 50 corporate-owned supermarkets in the Montreal area for the next three years, although closures, franchising and conversion of the remaining 23 outlets in the area are possible.    A Steinberg spokeswoman wouldn't comment on the agreement, other than to say it is subject to approval by the company's board at a meeting July 8.    The union and the company agreed to six years of no strikes and no lockouts, including terms of an initial three-year contract that would begin Sept. 26. Full-time workers initially would be subject to a longer workweek and part-time workers would take a C$1-an-hour pay cut in the first year of the pact. </TEXT></DOC>
