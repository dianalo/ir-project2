Describes trials at FMPE 1504 test center on 2 typesof ribs: round timber ribs, using logs 10 cm in diameter, and foam ribs.The first is used with a binder which remains plastic and does not increaseloading, the best being found to be powdered clay mixed with water. Thesecond is liable to suffer degradation of the foam, especially underheavy loading. Describes an attempt to make better use of foam's generallygood properties by combining it with the use of sacks made of propylenefibers and acting as geotextile materal (GEMAL 300D). These sacks arefilled with foam and then piled on top of one another, the gaps betweenthem being filled with foam (using compressed air at 0.5 MPa).</TEXT></DOC>
