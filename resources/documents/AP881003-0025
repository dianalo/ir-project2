Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and Dan Quayle ofIndiana have voted together for the Reagan tax cuts, military aidto the Contras, money for the MX missile and the death penalty fordrug-related murders.   On such issues as defense and capital punishment, in fact,Bentsen's voting record is at odds not with Quayle, but with hisown running mate, Michael Dukakis. Quayle, on the other hand, haslittle apparent quarrel with any of George Bush's positions.   Still, the two vice presidential candidates have often foundthemselves at loggerheads, including a recent battle over whetherto give workers 60 days' notice of plant closings.   As they gird for their nationally televised debate in Omaha,Neb., Wednesday night, each will be probing the other's record forpoints of attack.   For the younger, less experienced Republican, whose credentialsthe Democrats have ridiculed, the debate may also be an opportunityto emphasize those issues where he, Bush and Bentsen are of onemind _ and Dukakis is of another.   But there will also be ample opportunity for Bentsen to pointout stark differences between his and Quayle's voting records onsocial programs, labor issues, civil rights, education, energy andother matters.   Bentsen, 67, has served nearly 24 years in Congress, twice aslong as his 41-year-old rival, and the Texan is near the pinnacleof the Senate power structure as chairman of the Senate FinanceCommittee.   In this year alone, Bentsen has been the Democrats' point man insuccessful efforts to enact major legislation on trade,catastrophic health insurance for the elderly and the nation'swelfare programs.   A defense-minded Texas Tory, Bentsen was pushing for tax cuts _including a lower capital gains tax _ back in the late 1970s duringthe Carter administration, when he chaired the Joint EconomicCommittee.   Quayle is a back-bench Republican who sits on the ArmedServices, Budget and Labor and Human Services committees. His mainlegislative accomplishment during eight years in the Senate was theJob Training Partnership Act of 1983.   He made that legislative effort, with support from a liberalDemocrat, Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, over thereservations of the Reagan administration.   Quayle has been a stalwart supporter of the Strategic DefenseInitiative. But Bentsen also supports it. Like Bentsen, Quaylevoted in 1986 to override Reagan's veto of a bill imposingsanctions against South Africa's apartheid regime.   On the campaign trail, Quayle almost never mentions Bentsen,while constantly pillorying Dukakis as weak on defense and asmerely another ``inexperienced liberal governor'' like JimmyCarter, the last Democrat to occupy the White House.   But as a freshman member of the House in 1977, Quayle supportedCarter's plan to kill the B-1 bomber. In the pivotal vote, Quayleand seven other Republicans sided with the Democrats on a 202-199showdown on the issue. Reagan revived the B-1 when he took office,and all 100 bombers now have been built.   Quayle voted to sustain Reagan's veto this year of the CivilRights Restoration Act; Bentsen voted for the successful override.   On the plant closing notification law, Quayle was the leadingopponent and Bentsen the leading proponent. Quayle argued it wouldimpose ``a legislative straitjacket on industry'' and ``impede ourcapacity to compete in world markets.''   Bentsen and Quayle debated the issue last April 22 on publictelevision's MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour. Reagan later vetoed the tradebill because it contained the 60-day notice provision.   But Bentsen and fellow Democrats came back with separate tradeand plant closing notification bills. Reagan eventually signed thetrade bill and let the plant closing notification measure becomelaw without his signature.   Bentsen and Quayle were on opposite sides of this year's effortin Congress to raise the $3.35-an-hour minimum wage for the firsttime since 1981.   Quayle, after initially resisting any increase, supported acompromise including a sub-minimum training wage for teen-agers.Quayle says he now supports a $4 minimum wage, but says what theworking poor really need is better training and education, not ahigher minimum wage.   There will be no increase in the minimum wage this year,however. Faced with the threat of a Republican filibuster andunwilling to accept a sub-minimum wage for teens, Senate Democratsrecently dropped efforts to raise the minimum to $4.55.   Bentsen votes most of the time with the Democratic majority, buthe has broken ranks to support Reagan requests on Contra aid, SDIand the MX mobile missile.   Quayle was an outspoken opponent of legislation to ban the useof lie detectors in the workplace, and he complained when the WhiteHouse dropped its opposition last March that it had ``caved like ahouse of cards.'' Bentsen supported the bill.   Bentsen and Quayle were on opposite sides of the Senate's May 9,1985 vote for a one-year budget freeze _ including Social Security_ that passed 50-49, with Bush casting the tie-breaker. But whileBentsen voted against a freeze on that occasion, he voted twice in1984 and 1985 for other freeze proposals that would have delayedSocial Security cost-of-living increases for six or 12 months.   On other issues:   _Bentsen has voted in favor of prayer in public schools and fora Constitutional amendment to balance the budget _ both of whichare opposed by Dukakis and supported by Bush and Quayle.   _Bentsen, the Texan, also favors an oil import fee, whichDukakis, Bush and Quayle oppose.   _The Democrat senator sided with Quayle and most Republicans tokill a six-month extension of the amnesty period for illegalimmigrants.   _Quayle voted for the nomination of Robert Bork to the SupremeCourt; Bentsen voted with the Senate majority to reject it.   _The Republican led a successful fight in 1986 to winconfirmation of Daniel Manion to a seat on a federal appeals benchin Indiana. Critics had challenged the conservative lawyer'scredentials. Bentsen voted against Manion.   Quayle says he opposes abortion except to save a mother's life,and he has voted for an anti-abortion constitutional amendment andagainst federal funding of abortions. Bentsen also says hepersonally opposes abortion and federal funding except in cases ofrape, incest or to save a mother's life. But he has often votedagainst restrictions on funding and has voted against aconstitutional amendment to ban abortion.   The centrist Bentsen got identical ratings from the AFL-CIO andthe American Conservative Union in 1986: 50 percent from each.Quayle got a grade of 82 percent from the conservative group, butonly an 8 percent from the labor federation.</TEXT></DOC>
