I hope that in the future I will be able to forgive myself.''   Cooper was one of three Detroit judges indicted last year onbribery charges following a federal investigation.   Cooper, 47, pleaded guilty to the two charges in March in a pleabargain agreement in which extortion, racketeering and other incometax evasion charges were dropped. She could have faced 20 years inprison.   She admitted accepting $7,000 in bribes to rule in favor ofdefendants and hand down lenient sentences.   Defense attorney Cornelius Pitts called Cooper a victim of``human failing. ... The disease of gambling.''   ``I'm not going to have my head turned by your pretty littlewords,'' U.S. District Judge George Woods said, saying Cooperabused ``her high position of trust and betrayed her community thatneeded her skills so desperately.''   U.S. Attorney Stephen Markman said the sentence ``reflects theserious assault on the integrity of the Michigan criminal justicesystem and on the public trust.''   Woods allowed Cooper to remain free on bond until June 12.   Of the other two judges indicted, one pleaded guilty and isserving a 10-year sentence, and the other was acquitted on fourcharges and is awaiting retrial on a fifth.</TEXT></DOC>
