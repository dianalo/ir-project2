The builder of the Hummer military vehicle may soon make thefour-wheel-drive, five-ton jeep-like vehicle available to thepublic.   LTV Corp.'s AM General Division, which builds the Hummer, orHigh-Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle, has developed a newversion with a heavier chassis that can carry 2\ tons of cargo.   The Hummer is being sold to the Army, but AM General hasreceived inquiries from individuals who want the vehicle forhunting, ranching or just plain off-road fun.   Craig Mac Nab, company spokesman, said the South Bend,Ind.-based division is weighing product liability questions andconducting market studies on demand for the Hummer, which couldcost around $30,000 each.   Mac Nab told The Dallas Morning News he believes the vehiclecould be competitively priced with other upper-end, off-roadvehicles.   ``It wouldn't have to be as expensive as a military modelbecause you wouldn't need all those features,'' Mac Nab said.Military versions sport such features as armor plating and Stingermissile carriers.</TEXT></DOC>
