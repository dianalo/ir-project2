The arrests followed by less than two weeks the imposition by the Japanese government of trade restrictions on Toshiba Machine in connection with the exports. Toshiba Machine is a unit of Toshiba Corp., a Japanese maker of electronic goods.    Government investigators have said Toshiba, helped by two other Japanese concerns and a Norwegian company, illegally exported four metalworking machines and associated computer programs that are believed to have helped the Soviets design quieter submarines. The sales allegedly took place between December 1982 and June 1984.    A Pentagon spokesman earlier said that ultra-quiet propellers produced with the help of the illegally acquired Japanese and Norwegian technology already have been installed in some Soviet attack submarines.    The two Toshiba Machine executives arrested are Yuzo Hayashi, chief of the company's materials division, and Hiroaki Tanimura, vice director of a machine-technology division. They are charged with violating Japan's foreign-exchange and foreign-trade control laws. If convicted, the two face as many as three years in prison.    The men are suspected of involvement in the sale of a computer program to the Soviets in June 1984. They can't be charged in connection with the company's earlier exports of machine tools because of a three-year statute of limitations.    According to Japanese officials, Toshiba Machine illegally misrepresented the machine tools' capabilities in obtaining export permission from the government. </TEXT></DOC>
