Further, grain that is obviously of inferior qualitybecause it is in an unusual state or condition and that cannot be gradedproperly by use of other grading factors provided in the standards is considered``distinctly low quality'' and also graded ``U.S. Sample grade.'' Inspectorsmay grade grain containing DE as ``U.S. Sample grade'' either due to thepresence of an unknown foreign substance or due to an unusual condition. DE consists of siliceous skeletons of unicellular plants of the algae familywhich are recognized by the complex structure of their cell walls. Individualdiatoms are generally less than \1/200\ inch in size; thus requiring microscopicexamination for positive identification. DE is a natural insecticide andis used to control insects in grain. When used on grain, DE usually appearsas a light gray or white dust. When applied at very low levels, DE maynot be readily visible on grain but the texture of the grain may feel coarsecompared to grain for which DE was not applied. For these reasons, it isnot possible to readily differentiate DE from potentially toxic substances. When added to wheat as an insecticide, DE influences the physical propertiesof wheat. The degree of influence is governed, in part, based on the levelof application. Test weight per bushel, a measurement used by many millersas a general indicator of quality or end-product yield, is often reducedwith the addition of DE. Further, grain flowability is reduced which influencesthe efficiency of handling grain.  The Environmental Protection Agency has registered as an insecticide severalbrand names of DE. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also addressedDE in its regulations (CFR title 21, chapter 1, parts 182, 193, 561, and573). FDA recognizes DE as safe when used as described, as an indirectfood additive and in feed and drinking water of animals. A health concern regarding DE relates to the small amount of crystallinesilica (less than 3 percent) occurring in DE. The Encyclopedia of OccupationalHealth and Safety issued by the International Labor Office in Geneva, Switzerlandnotes that DE contains some crystalline silica which: (1) Is a health hazardby inhalation, (2) is a possible carcinogen for humans, and (3) causessilicosis, a noncancerous lung disease. The International Agency for Researchon Cancer of the World Health Organization has classified crystalline silicaas probably carcinogenic for humans. FGIS has received requests from grain processors and distributors of DErequesting that FGIS not grade grain ``U.S. Sample grade'' when it containsDE. In response to these requests, FGIS, is requesting comments on theneed for an inspection procedure that would permit an applicant for inspectionto request that grain be tested for DE and graded without regard to thepresence of DE. If such a request was not made, the grain would continueto be graded according to current procedures.  In general, if such an inspection policy is considered desirable, inspectionprocedures would be revised to allow an applicant for inspection to requestthe microscopic examination for DE through the official agency or FGISfield office responsible for providing inspection services in the subjectgeographic area. The request would be required prior to, or at the sametime, as, a request for official inspection. Upon receipt of the requestfor examination, the official agency or FGIS field office would send asample of the involved grain to an FGIS laboratory capable of testing forthe presence of DE.  The testing laboratory would examine the same for DE using a standard laboratoryprocedure. Copies of the procedure would be available upon request fromFGIS. Upon completion of the examination, the testing laboratory wouldnotify the official agency or FGIS field office of the results by the mostexpedient method. An appropriate fee to cover testing costs would be developedfor this service if this procedure is adopted.  If the examination determines that DE is present in the sample, the grainwould be graded without regard to the presence of DE, and a statement wouldappear on the official inspection certificate indicating that the graincontains DE. If it is determined that the grain does not contain DE butsome other unknown foreign substance, the grain would be considered ``U.S.Sample grade'' in accordance with the official U.S. Standards for Grain. <ITAG tagnum="21">(<T4>Authority: </T4>Pub.
