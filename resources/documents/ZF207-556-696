no price or availability details.andM;-  o  -andM;The Aeronautic Division of Ford Motor Co's Ford Aerospace unit hasandM;announced successful testing of a custom Configurable Pipeline Processor chiprated at 500 MIPS and designed specifically for the US Army Missile Command:the chip is implemented on a gate array fabricated for Ford by LSI LogicCorp, uses 54,000 gates, has a 16-bit data path and is clocked at 20MHz.andM;-  o  -andM;Technische Universiteit Twente in the Netherlands claims to haveandM;observed superconductivity at minus 196oC - the temperature at which freelyavailable Nitrogen liquifies - in a compound made up of thin layers of aTritium, Barium, Copper and Oxygen ceramic, alternating with extremely thinlayers of an Aluminium Oxide isolation material.andM;-  o  -andM;AST Research Inc, Irvine, California has a new SixPak 286 a 16-andM;bit enhancement board for 80286 micros: the thing starts at 512Kb and is in512Kb or 2Mb increments to 4Mb using 256K-bit or 1M-bit memory chips: theboard supports expanded memory applications and has extended memory supportfor protected mode operating systems such as OS/2 and Unix;
