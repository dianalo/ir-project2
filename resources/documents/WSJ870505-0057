The initiative is seen as Germany's contribution to U.S. and Japanese steps to bolster the dollar by creating a wider differential between their interest rates. A West German move would complement Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's promise to order Japan's Finance Ministry and central bank to lower short-term interest rates. Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board has tightened credit in the past few weeks, pushing U.S. interest rates higher.    &quot;What the Bundesbank is considering must be seen in connection with what is going on between Washington and Tokyo,&quot; one Frankfurt banking source said.    Monetary analysts viewed the possible step as having more symbolic than monetary value. They said they were skeptical that lower refinancing costs alone would be enough to fuel the domestic economy and bolster the U.S. dollar.    &quot;It would be more of a step aimed at stabilizing currency-exchange rates than aiding the German economy,&quot; said Hermann Remsperger, a monetary analyst for BHF-Bank in Frankfurt. &quot;But one would even have to be skeptical whether a lower repurchase rate would have a lasting impact on dollar-mark exchange rates.&quot;    In Washington, a U.S. policy maker said that a West German rate cut &quot;would be very useful. That's what they need to do. In fact, the German economic situation is even weaker than the Japanese.&quot; The U.S. has been urging both West Germany and Japan to adopt stimulative economic policies so that they can absorb more imports from the rest of the world.    The Bundesbank's president, Karl Otto Poehl, is believed to advocate the cut but so far hasn't been able to convince a majority of the central bank council's 17 other members to support the proposal. The policy-making council's monetary conservatives are said to oppose the measure as expansionary at a time when the West German banking system already has sufficient liquidity.    Monetary analysts expect Mr. Poehl to resurrect the issue at Thursday's council meeting. If the council agrees to cut the repurchase rate by as much as one-half percentage point, the new rate of about 3.3% would be only slightly higher than the Bundesbank's 3% discount rate, which is its lending fee to financial institutions. The discount rate likely wouldn't be altered.    Mr. Poehl's ability to win over dissenters is a new test of his influence in the central bank council, analysts said. Mr. Poehl's position may be weakened, sources said, because the Bonn government hasn't officially confirmed that he will be appointed to a second eight-year term when his current mandate expires at the end of the year.    The Bundesbank wouldn't comment on the agenda for Thursday's meeting.    Under the Bundesbank's repurchase arrangement, banks draw one-month funds from the central bank using securities as collateral. The Bundesbank increasingly has used the instrument to fine-tune liquidity levels in West German money markets.    Word of the Bundesbank's internal deliberations had by yesterday seeped into West Germany's financial markets, where lower Bundesbank repurchase rates could depress market interest rates. But the Bundesbank also would expect commercial banks to pass any cut in the repurchase rate into the economy with cuts in consumer lending rates.    West Germany's large banks have declined to loosen credit this year despite the Bundesbank's half-point cut in its discount rate in January. That cut was accompanied by a reduction in the repurchase rate to 3.8% from about 4.35%. </TEXT></DOC>
