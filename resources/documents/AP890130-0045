Sunday's vote also will send two members of the Republican Partyto the federal parliament next year, the first time that the extremeright will be represented in Bonn since 1953.   ``Kick out the Nazis, foreigners stay,'' several thousand peoplechanted as they marched through West Berlin late Sunday to protestthe Republican Party's success.   In the balloting, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing ChristianDemocrats lost their majority in West Berlin's legislature and saidthey now plan to form a governing coalition with the left-of-centerSocial Democrats. Kohl told the ARD television network that he was``alarmed'' by the showing of the Republicans.   The 5-year-old Republican Party captured 11 seats in Sunday'svoting for the 138-member West Berlin state legislature. West Berlinis considered a state under the West German system, but itsrepresentatives in the national parliament have limited powers.   Former Nazi SS soldier Franz Schoenhuber, the Republican leader,had led a campaign to oust Turks and other foreign workers from WestBerlin. Foreigners make up about 10 percent of the city's populationof 2 million.   West Germans often have expressed concern about the growingnumber of foreigners in their country, but Sunday's vote providedthe most dramatic example in years of a major election success for aparty with strong opposition to foreigners.   It was the first state election in West Germany since the Octoberdeath of Governor Franz Josef Strauss of Bavaria, thearch-conservative who is credited with keeping smaller right-wingextremists groups in check. Many people had predicted his deathwould create the possibility for the smaller rightist groups to havea shot at success.   Schoenhuber, 66, told rallies during the election campaign thatthe Christian Democrats were ``drifting further and further to theleft.''   The Republicans won 7.5 percent of the vote on Sunday, accordingto nearly complete official returns. The Christian Democrats won 38percent of the vote and 55 seats, losing 12 seats from the lastelection four years ago.   Christian Democratic Mayor Eberhard Diepgen's coalition partners,the Free Democrats, lost all 12 of their seats by failing to musterthe 5 percent of the vote necessary for representation.   The Social Democrats won 37 percent of the vote for 55 seats andthe left-wing Alternative List party won 17 seats with a 12 percentshowing, a gain of two seats.   Diepgen said the Republicans' successful bid to enter thelegislature ``should not be allowed to cast the city and itsresidents in a false light.''   West German news media reacted with shock to the results in WestBerlin.   The Frankfurt-based Hesse State Radio broadcast a special reporttoday that which concluded that while the Republican Party showedfar-rightist tendencies, it was far from the Nazi party that gainedhold in Germany in the 1920s.   The Republican Party was formed in 1983, and its previous bestsuccess was a 3 percent share of the votes in 1986 state electionsin traditionally conservative Bavaria.   Sunday's surprise success will send two Republican Party membersto the federal parliament after national elections next year. WestBerlin's 22-member delegation in the federal parliament can vote incommittee but has very limited voting rights in full sessions.   They will be the first right-wing extremists in the Bonn assemblysince 1953. The German Reich Party had five members during the firstWest German legislature starting in 1949.   Just under 80 percent of West Berlin's voters cast ballots onSunday, according to television forecasts, compared with 83.6percent in 1985.   West Berlin is a separate state of West Germany surrounded byEast German territory. It was formed from Western zones of Berlinoccupied by the Allied forces in World War II.</TEXT></DOC>
