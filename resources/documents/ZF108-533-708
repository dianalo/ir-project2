MoserandM;Although the OS/2 Extended Edition 1.2 Database Manager has a powerfulprogramming language and LAN services, buyers report they want tools that areeasier to use.andM;The Database Manager &quot;is meant to be a portable Systems ApplicationArchitecture tool that has to support a variety of platforms, which includethe mainframe,&quot; said Richard Finkelstein, president of Performance ComputingInc., a database consulting firm in Chicago.andP;  &quot;They are reaching that goalbut through heavy compromise.&quot;andM;According to Finkelstein, one such compromise is the heavy reliance onprocedural programming to do updates and data retrieval.andP;  &quot;The DatabaseManager still retains a mainframe feel to it in terms of how it processes,&quot;he said, adding that there are very few built-in features for creating usefulapplications without having to program in the REXX language.andM;&quot;People don't want to write in REXX when they're used to writing in Paradox,&quot;he said.andP;  However, &quot;REXX is a high-level interpreter language that'srelatively easy to learn for someone who's used to programming.andP;  I find iteasier to learn than dBASE,&quot; Finkelstein added.andM;According to Harley Hahn, president of Harley Hahn Consultants in Austin,Texas, &quot;REXX is a much more sophisticated version of the DOS batch language.andO;The Database Manager is mainframe technology brought down to the PC.andP;  TheQuery Manager and REXX are mainframe tools.&quot;andM;If programmers don't know REXX, they can use COBOL, Pascal, C or FORTRAN toprogram in the Database Manager, he said.andM;Multiple PlatformsandM;Buyers agreed that the Database Manager's key advantage is that it allowsprogrammers to write one set of application code that can run on multipleplatforms, as well as create one database design.andM;Keith Sievers, vice president of information processing for Federal KemperInsurance Co. in Decatur, Ill., runs a policy-rating application on a PC andenters new data on the firm's mainframe at night.andM;Under OS/2 one set of source code can be compiled and run with SQL inconjunction with Database Manager on the PC and with DB2 on the mainframe,Sievers said.andM;According to Sievers, distributed-data processing is not yet a completereality, so he wrote his own Advanced Program-to-Program Communications(APPC) program to create duplicate DB2 files in the Database Manager.andM;&quot;We're moving from a mainframe base to LAN-based architecture,&quot; he said.andO;&quot;Having a relational database locally should speed up the developmentprocess.&quot;andM;Although OS/2 Extended Edition (EE) 1.2 was easy to install, the DatabaseManager took a little negotiating, claimed Performance Computing'sFinkelstein.andP;  &quot;The Database Manager was very sensitive, and it took a longtime to piece together a configuration that would work,&quot; he said.andM;For an optimum installation, all nodes should be running OS/2, Finkelsteinsaid.andP;  He found incompatibilities when running OS/2 and DOS machines on anEthernet LAN.andM;&quot;IBM didn't supply an Ethernet driver for DOS machines, and that blew out theLAN Server,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;We can't run OS/2 EE as a server over LAN Manager because there's a conflictof drivers, so we're flip-flopping back and forth depending on what we wantto do,&quot; he added.andM;Some buyers say they would like to see more Database Manager tools developed,but they also agree that moving their development environment to the PC willenable their programmers to be more productive, to test code more efficientlyand to have more control over the development environment.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
