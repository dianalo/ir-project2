Dan Turner and CristoferShihar had one chance in five of seeing 1984.   They don't know why they've survived what has been a deathsentence for more than 45,000 Americans, but say it may be a matterof attitude.   ``A lot of people don't die of the disease, they die because theygive up,'' said Mike, a 34-year-old Chicagoan who was diagnosed withacquired immune deficienty syndrome in January 1984. He asked thathis last name be withheld.   According to Judith Wiker, a Chicago holistic therapist who saysshe has counseled hundreds of clients with AIDS or AIDS-relatedproblems, Mike is one of many people with the disease who are wellenough to feel and act normal.   ``There are a lot of healthy people running around with AIDS,''she said.   Scientists are trying to determine just why some people havesurvived as long as 10 years with AIDS. The federal Centers forDisease Control in Atlanta is studying 119 people known to havelived with it for three or more years.   ``Is the virus somehow different?'' asks Ann M. Hardy, a CDCepidemiologist now at the National Center for Health Statistics inHyattsville, Md. ``Is it something in their immune system?''   Does survival time hinge on the mildness or severity of theinfections that attack people with AIDS? Or could the key really bea ``lifestyle-psychosocial type of thing'' _ a positive attitude andemotional support?   All of these possibilities are now being studied, either by theCDC or in studies funded by the National Institutes of Health.   For the purposes of the CDC's 2-year-old study, long-termsurvivors were defined as people who lived at least three yearsafter being diagnosed.   Unlike the estimated hundreds of thousands of Americans who areinfected with the AIDS virus but do not have symptoms, long-termsurvivors actually have battled one or more ailments that defineacquired immune deficiency syndrome _ including Kaposi's sarcoma,pneumonia, damaged immune systems and severe weight loss.   Most long-term survivors are white homosexual men in their 30swhose main or only symptom is Kaposi's sarcoma, the skin cancer thatwas rare before AIDS became an epidemic, CDC data indicates.   ``The major issue people are interested in is what way the immuneresponse for the long-term survivor is different than in theshort-term survivor,'' said Dr. Henry Masur, deputy chief ofcritical care medicine at the the Clinical Center of the NIH inBethesda, Md.   ``With any disease, whether it's cancer or pneumonia, in ahealthy person, some people get sick very quickly and die and otherpeople survive much longer. With breast cancer or colon cancer, somepeople will be dead within a few months and some people will go for30 years,'' Masur said.   For Mike, an accountant, three years of chemotherapy kept theskin sores of Kaposi's sarcoma at bay. He then began treatment withthe drug AZT, now called zidovudine, which prolongs the lives ofmany with AIDS.   Mike, who considers himself ``fairly lucky,'' said his onlycurrent health problem is mild leg pain. ``I'm basically as normalas they get. Nobody would know, if they saw me on the street, that Ihad been diagnosed with AIDS.''   Turner, 42, of San Francisco, was diagnosed with Kaposi's inFebruary 1982, before most Americans _ including doctors _ had heardof AIDS.   ``I do believe one can live with AIDS and strike up a bargain andco-exist with the virus, as we do with other viruses,'' said Turner.   He underwent chemotherapy, a year of acupuncture, took megadosesof Vitamin C for a while, has taken zidovudine intermittently sinceearly 1988 and still gets alpha-interferon, a genetically engineeredanti-cancer drug.   ``I go to the gym regularly, and I try to maintain my weight andmy energy level,'' said Turner, who writes and performs music. ``Afriend and I have just finished writing a movie script, which wehope to sell.''   Shihar, 38, of Los Angeles, was diagnosed with Kaposi's inNovember 1982, and said he's done ``just about the opposite of allthe recommended treatments'' but his illness went into remissionanyway.   ``I would love to say it was all very spiritual, but I was inremission before I became spiritual,'' said Shihar, who works forNorthern Lights Alternatives, a New York-based education and supportorganization for people with AIDS. ``I think the one thing I hearfrom people I know who have survived is they're real stubborn.''   Ms. Wiker believes ``there is a certain kind of person that is asurvivor with AIDS. That kind of personality is one that startsliving in the moment, a person that is letting go of their pastfeelings and fears ... and they're letting go of future projectionsabout death.''   That theory is being tested in a federally funded study at theNew York State Psychiatric Institute, where 450 people infected withthe AIDS virus are being tracked for five years to determine whethertheir emotional state influences their resistance to the illness.   ``Most people would like to believe they have control over this,and if they remain optimistic and cheerful it will help,'' said Dr.Jack M. Gorman, associate professor of clinical psychiatry atColumbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and principalinvestigator in the study.   ``And we certainly want to encourage people to remain optimisticand cheerful, but we don't really know if it makes a difference ornot, and that's what we're trying to see,'' he added.   Regardless of psychological factors, survival prospectscontinually improve in newly diagnosed AIDS cases, thanks to drugtreatments such as zidovudine and an aerosol form of pentamidine, amedication that fights the rare type of pneumonia that has beenhighly fatal to AIDS patients.   As recently as two years ago, 80 percent of people with AIDS wereexpected to die within 24 months, but that has changed dramatically,said Dr. Nathaniel Pier, a New York City physician with a largenumber of AIDS patients.   The CDC says it can't currently estimate AIDS victims' averagesurvival.   ``As of November 1988, we can assist somebody to stay alive andhealthy for two years, with the current therapy,'' Piers said. ``Anda great deal may occur in two years. We've seen an enormous changefrom 1986 to 1988.   ``Many people being diagnosed now may benefit from breakthroughsthat will totally change the surface of the disease.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Jan. 5</NOTE></DOC>
