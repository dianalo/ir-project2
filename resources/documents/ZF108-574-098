GrossmanandM;In an effort to help users extend the life of their 286 PCs while broadeningthe market for 80287 math coprocessors, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD)this week will introduce an 80287-compatible chip for $99 -- almost one-thirdthe $250 price of nemesis Intel Corp.'s 80287.andM;Intel, meanwhile, is seeking an injunction to keep AMD from selling the chip,according to Intel spokeswoman Pam Polacce in Santa Clara, Calif.andM;By offering the chip for only $99, AMD hopes many of the 20 million current286 users will be persuaded to upgrade their systems and that several OEMswill ship the math coprocessor with new PCs and laptops, said Glen Burchers,processor marketing manager for AMD's PC products division in Austin, Texas.andM;&quot;The installed base of 286 PC users can spend $99 to increase the performanceof their existing machine instead of spending $2,000 for a new SX system,&quot;Burchers said.andM;Originally developed by Intel, the 80287 math coprocessor is designed tospeed math-intensive programs such as CAD, graphics and spreadsheetapplications.andP;  AMD's 80C287 chip is based on microcode that the companylicensed from Intel.andP;  It is 100 percent function- and pin-compatible,according to Burchers.andM;Intel, however, contends that AMD licensed the microcode for internal useonly and thus does not have the right to sell or distribute products based onthe code.andM;Countered AMD spokesman David Frink, &quot;We're very certain that we had therights, based on the contract, to make and sell products based on [Intel'smicrocode], and it's ludicrous for them to think otherwise.&quot;andM;A court date has not been set, but both sides have agreed that users buyingthe AMD chip would not be subject to any retroactive penalties, regardless ofa judge's decision.andM;Analysts said the new chip could garner market share quickly if users arepersuaded of its benefits.andP;  &quot;Anytime you can cut the street price in half,you've got a shot at getting some volume,&quot; said Bruce Stephen, an analyst atmarket researcher International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass.andM;AMD initially will sell the 10MHz 80287 processor directly to end usersthrough a toll-free phone number.andP;  A standard 12MHz chip as well as low-power10MHz and 12MHz versions for laptops will be sold to OEMs and chipdistributors, Burchers said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
