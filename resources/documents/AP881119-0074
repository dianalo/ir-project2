The World Resources Institute said the United States gained 33percent in energy used per dollar of gross national product, thetotal retail value of all goods and services produced by theeconomy, in those 16 years.   Japan ranked second with a 32 percent gain. Gains of some othercountries included Canada and France, 28 percent; West Germany, 23percent; Britain, 19 percent; Italy, 15 percent, and Brazil, 6percent.   The International Energy Agency recently ranked the United Statesin eighth place among 20 countries in gains in efficiency of energyuse by industry from 1973 to 1985.   Pushed by the two oil shocks of the 1970s and rapidly risingprices that continued through the early 1980s, most developednations managed to use less energy to turn out goods and services bythe mid-1980s.   According to figures compiled by the U.S. Energy InformationAdministration, U.S. energy efficiency improved at about 1.1 percentper year in the 1970s, accelerated to 2.8 percent per year from 1980to 1986 and remained essentially unchanged in 1986-87.   An 0.6 percent gain is expected this year.   Here is the energy use per dollar of gross national product,expressed in terms Btus per dollars of 1980 buying power for eachcountry: (A Btu or British thermal unit is a standard energy unit.About 300 Btus are used in boiling a quart of water.)   United States, 19,585; France, 8,264; Japan, 9,285; Italy,10,714; Germany, 10,714; Brazil, 10,775; Britain, 13,829; Canada,23,177.   For comparison, here are 1986 figures for some other countries:China, 41,128; India, 27,815; Poland, 83,646; Hungary, 47,062.</TEXT></DOC>
