M. Ericsson in Sweden, andNEC and Fujitsu in Japan.andM;ISDN offers these manufacturers the opportunity to replace the phonecompanies' aging but still functional analog equipment and to sell expensivenew ISDN line cards for existing digital equipment.andP;  It also offers a way todifferentiate products that are becoming increasingly generic.andP;  Becausedeveloping a new switch can cost more than $1 billion, vendors are eager todo all they can to create demand and give their products an edge.andM;So far, they have sold only a few ISDN switches, but the telephone carriersseem to be picking up the ISDN fervor.andP;  Carriers around the world--includingATandamp;T and the regional Bell operating companies, the major European telephonecompanies and telecommunications ministries, and Japan's Nippon Telegraph andTelephone (NTT)--are beginning to see ISDN as the ticket to efficientdelivery of a wide variety of new services, ranging from sophisticatedtelephone features to advanced data transmission to videotext and informationservices.andP;  These services would also give the telephone carriers new pricingflexibility and help them compete with the alternative communicationstechnologies.andM;Most carriers say they will make the expensive jump to ISDN only as demandwarrants.andP;  But without the ISDN switches, there can be no ISDN.andP;  Someone isgoing to have to make a leap of faith to get ISDN off the ground.andM;End-use equipment suppliers such as IBM, ATandamp;T, Fujitsu ISDN Systems, and evenHayes Microcomputer Products are betting that someone will make that leap.andO;All of these companies have already announced plans to make ISDN-compatiblephones, terminals, and/or adapter cards.andM;That means the only people left to convert are the ones who would actuallyuse the new system.andP;  Sure, a few companies, including the McDonald'sCorporation, Tenneco, the 3M Corporation, Shearson Lehman Hutton, and theU.S.andP;  National Bank of Oregon are or have been involved in ISDN pilotprojects, and most seem to like what they're getting.andP;  But for the vastmajority of possible customers, from mainframe data processors to PC users tohome telephone subscribers, ISDN remains a vague promise, not a tangiblereality.andM;What's in It for You?andM;If everything goes as planned, ISDN should have a profound effect on personalcomputer users.andP;  The preachers say that ISDN will eventually give userscomplete access to end-to-end digital connectivity.andP;  That will make all kindsof communication, including the PC variety, much easier and cheaper.andM;The all-digital pipe should eventually eliminate the need for modems as weknow them, while increasing the reliability of data transfer.andP;  ISDN isdesigned to let users send data, voice, and video from PC to host or from PCto PC more easily and far faster than they can with conventional modems.andM;The holy word is integration.andP;  Since ISDN puts all kinds of traffic on thesame network users of all kinds of voice and data equipment will be able toconnect to the universal world of information just by plugging their ISDNcomputer/telephones into a jack in the wall.andP;  You'll be able to talk on onechannel, use 3270 terminal emulation or a modem connection on anotherchannel, and enlist ISDN's signaling channel to control everything.andO;Terminal-adapter cards and telephones equipped with ISDN boards will replacemodems in most cases.andM;ISDN will allow what Apple Computer's ISDN guru David Gilbert refers to as&quot;collaborative computing,&quot; the ability for two people to see each other'sscreens in real time while they're talking on the telephone, no matter wherethey may be located.andP;  Outside of local area networks, Gilbert says, &quot;today wedon't see these kinds of applications because of limited bandwidth at the PClevel.andP;  In real time it's just not fast enough.andP;  But ISDN's 64Kbps channelsare slick.&quot;andM;In addition, ISDN will let computer users send facsimile messages, accessonline databases, and transmit video images, all from their desks.andM;The integration of computers and telephones will also usher in a wide varietyof new telecommunications services.andP;  An ISDN phone connected to a PC couldidentify the number of the caller before you pick up the phone and evendeliver relevant information from a database, such as the calling party'saccount records.andM;The ability to have a client's entire file on the screen immediately as hecalls in could make a personal banker &quot;look like an Einstein,&quot; according toEarl Vogt, manager of telecommunications for the U.S.andP;  National Bank ofOregon in Portland, a pioneer ISDN installation begun in 1986.andP;  NorthernTelecom has written a prototype ISDN PC software package named Call Managerto do just that.andM;In the office, most people will access ISDN through PCs or workstationsconnected to mainframes or minicomputers, or through a PC equipped with anISDN telephone and/or an ISDN terminal adapter card.andP;  With ISDN, thetelephone is as important a factor as the computer, since telephoneconnections tie an office together.andM;Of LANs and WANsandM;ISDN will dramatically alter the role of today's networks, but the exacteffects remain to be seen.andP;  Some say ISDN is too slow to compete with localarea networks, which typically run at speeds of 1 to 10Mbps.andM;But ISDN advocates claim it will be plenty fast enough for many common LANapplications, including electronic mail and peripheral sharing.andP;  Ed Howard,senior technical consultant at ATandamp;T Network Systems in Atlanta, which hasbeen using ISDN-compatible EasyLAN software instead of conventional LANsoftware for PC-to-PC communication, comments that &quot;people can only type sofast, certainly not at 10Mbps.&quot;andM;ISDN's Primary Rate Interface is fast enough to compete with LANs, but it isnot clear when or if it will arrive on the desktop.andP;  &quot;I don't think we'regoing to see the Primary Rate Insterface, at speeds of 1.544Mbps, at thedesktop level in the near future,&quot; predicts Jim Borton, a product manager atNCR's PC division in Dayton, Ohio.andM;ISDN will probably have a greater impact on wide area networks than it willon local area networks.andP;  Even the Basic Rate Interface speed of 64Kbpsrepresents a significant step up from the speed of the modems used today as agateway to host computers.andM;Some observers picture an &quot;interLAN&quot; environment where geographicallyseparate ISDN-compatible LANs will connect with each other through ISDN.andP;  Thenew network will function as a kind of wide area network linking the LANs,but potentially at a lower cost than today's T-1 or X.25 options.andM;Just as important, ISDN will work over a building's existing twisted-paircopper telephone wire, helping to reduce costly rewiring.andP;  And because NorthAmerican cable installers, electrical contractors, and network provisionersare used to working with twisted-pair telephone wire, they won't requireexpensive training to learn how to pull new types of wire and cable when newwiring is needed.andM;This Time It's for RealandM;Right now, of course, ISDN is mostly promises.andP;  To be truly effective, itwill have to be available to everyone all the time, and that will take awhile.andM;Eric Arnum, a senior analyst in communications technology at InternationalResource Development, a Connecticut-based research firm, predicts that ISDNwill appear widely in the workplace in the mid-1990s, and then in the homejust after the year 2000.andM;What's the reason for the delay?andP;  &quot;The carriers are still working on makingthe jump to digital,&quot; Arnum points out, &quot;but it's taking time.andP;  There aretelephone loading coils that have been around for years--maybe yourgrandfather installed them--that work fine with analog transmission but stopdigital in its tracks.andM;&quot;So even in office situations,&quot; he continues, &quot;there will initially be onlyislands of ISDN, and then only in downtown areas.andP;  Eventually we'll see ISDNnationally, but it will appear sporadically as carriers meet the standards,vendors build ISDN products, and costs become affordable.&quot;andM;Garry Betty, senior vice president at moderm manufacturer HayesMicrocomputer, which is building ISDN products and using ISDN services fromSouthern Bell, notes that the implementation of ISDN may be closer thanpeople think.andP;  &quot;We at Hayes have been 'productizing' the technology sinceMarch of 1987.andP;  We believe we'll have considerable deployment of ISDNservices in 1989.andP;  Southwestern Bell Telephone already has contracts tosupply 17,700 ISDN lines, Southern Bell has five [ISDN] customers, and Nynexhas a large ISDN commitment.andP;  Every couple of months a major obstacle to ISDNis overcome.andP;  The technology is ready.andP;  It's simply a matter of provisioning,tariffs, cost analysis, and conversions,&quot; Betty says.andM;Nonbelievers, on the other hand, think that ISDN faces too many hurdles toever succeed.andP;  For everything to work smoothly, the skeptics say, naturalcompetitors must suddenly switch gears and build products that not only meetISDN specifications but also work with each other.andM;In addition, a number of crucial standards issues must still be resolved.andO;Fortunately, 1988 was a &quot;milestone year&quot; for ISDN standards, says Gail Smith,principal product manager at the Codex Corporation, in Canton, Massachusetts,and chairwoman of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) T1S1.1ISDN Technical Standards Committee.andM;Paying the PriceandM;The high priests of ISDN claim that the new network's fast transmission speedand quick connetions will cut communications costs.andM;But high equipment costs will temper usage savings.andP;  Until vendors beginmass-producing ISDN equipment, unit costs will remain stratospheric.andP;  You mayhave to choose between a $10 regular telephone and a $200 ISDN phone.andP;  Anduntil hardware sales reach a critical mass, software applications willcontinue to be scarce and pricey.andM;Russell Roy, manager of telecommunications at Tenneco Gas Pipeline, inHouston, which is now using ISDN, says terminal adapter boards to give PCsbasic rate access will probably cost $1,400 to $1,500 each in 1989--expensivefor a PC enhancement.andM;Whether ISDN is really worth it depends on the tariffs telephone carrierscharge for ISDN service.andP;  U.S.andP;  telephone companies have not yet standardizedprices for ISDN services, although NTT in Japan has announced prices for aslightly different version of ISDN.andP;  In general, observers expect an ISDNBasic Rate Interface line to cost more than a standard voice line but lessthan two separate lines.andM;Early ApplicationsandM;In addition to cost savings, ISDN will offer a single access to all kinds ofcommunications services.andP;  &quot;Initially we will see applications like super-fasthome shopping, video, and high-speed facsimile,&quot; says Apple's David Gilbert.andO;&quot;These applications will be as widespread as VisiCalc was in the early PCdays.&quot;andM;Meanwhile, Doe Jones andamp; Company, in Princeton, New Jersey, is studying ISDNboth for internal use and for customer access to its Down JonesNews/Retrieval service, Tom Pace, associate director of nationalcommunications, says the company will permit ISDN access to News/Retrievaland Dowphone as soon as ISDN lines are widely available to PC users.andM;But the company seems to be in no hurry.andP;  &quot;We're waiting until the localphone companies make it available to the home.andP;  ISDN might be OK forcorporations in the near future, but not soon for dial-up databases,&quot; Pacesays.andM;ISDN may be a cult, but it's already attracted some pretty importantdevotees.andP;  If the supporters of the new network can make good on theirpromises and keep prices down, ISDN could be one cult that goes mainstream,to everyone's benefit.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
