Terrence Murray, told analysts in New York that Fleet expects to report a 42% rise in per-share earnings for the fourth quarter.    Fleet said it expects to post fourth-quarter net income of about $37 million, or $1.35 a fully diluted share, compared with earnings of $26.6 million, or 95 cents a fully diluted share, a year earlier. The year-earlier earnings, which have been restated, included $4 million of expenses from Fleet's purchase of First Connecticut Bancorp and Merrill Bankshares, Fleet said.    The bank holding and financial services concern said it expects to report that 1986 net rose about 29% to $137 million, or $5 a share fully diluted, from $105.7 million, or $3.89 a share fully diluted, in 1985.    Mr. Murray cited &quot;particularly strong results&quot; from Fleet's mortgage banking units as a major contributor to its projected earnings rise. Fleet Mortgage, Milwaukee, is expected to earn more than $17 million in 1986, up from $7 million in 1985, he added.    Fleet's return on common equity for 1986 will be about 20%, up from 18.2% last year, Mr. Murray said. Return on assets will be about 1.4% in 1986, compared with 1.33% in 1985. </TEXT></DOC>
