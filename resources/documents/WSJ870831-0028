But the country's bank stocks have languished while U.S. bank issues have soared.    Some analysts say the lack of excitement reflects Canadian investors' greater concerns about troubled Third World debt. &quot;Investors here recognize that banks have only just begun to make adequate reserves,&quot; says Roy Palmer, an analyst with Alfred Bunting in Montreal.    But others argue that investors are missing an opportunity to buy inexpensive, blue-chip bank stocks. &quot;There is a perception among foreign investors that in Canada you buy oil, mining and gold stocks, but one of the best buys now is Canadian bank stocks,&quot; says Mary Hallward, a bank analyst with Nesbitt, Thomson in Toronto.    In the past two weeks Canada's six largest banks more than doubled their loan loss reserves to between 35% and 40% of their total 25 billion Canadian dollars ($19 billion) in loans to less developed countries. The increased reserves forced major Canadian banks to report huge losses in their fiscal third quarter ended July 31. But their capital bases remain stronger than U.S. banks.    Patricia Meredith, an analyst with Wood Gundy, estimates the common equity of Canada's major banks equals an average 4% of assets, compared with Citicorp's 3.2%.    Yet since the reserve increases were announced the stock prices of Canada's six largest banks have fallen an average 4%. Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of Montreal, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Bank of Nova Scotia, Toronto-Dominion Bank and National Bank of Canada account for about 99% of 413.7 billion dollars in domestic Canadian bank assets.    Since May, when Citicorp sparked the U.S. bank rally with its announcement of a $3 billion loan loss reserve increase, the six Canadian bank stocks have climbed a scant 5%. In contrast, Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods' index of 24 major U.S. banks rose 20% during the same period.    The timing of Canadian banks' reserve increases worked against them. In the same week that Canadian banks announced their reserve increases, Citicorp disclosed its plan to issue as much as $1 billion in new common equity. Bank stock prices in both countries slipped on the news because of investors' fears that banks' actions to rebuild their balance sheets would dilute shares outstanding.    &quot;Citicorp stole the Canadian banks' thunder when they announced their equity issue,&quot; says James McDermott, Keefe Bruyette's research director.    Indeed, Canadian bank stock holders face a greater threat of dilution because, unlike U.S. bank rules, Canadian regulations prohibit banks from including loan loss reserves as part of their capital. Wood Gundy's Ms. Meredith estimates Canadian banks will raise about one billion dollars in new equity over the next year. But she argues their stock prices are still undervalued compared with U.S. banks.    The big lure for Canadian bank stocks is potential profit increases in fiscal 1988. By reporting all their increased reserves on loans to less developed countries as a special charge in the fiscal third quarter, Canadian banks will have far smaller loan losses in fiscal 1988, Mrs. Hallward of Nesbitt Thomson says. That should set the stage for large profit increases.    Mrs. Hallward predicts that Canadian bank profits, excluding the special charge, will increase an average 36% in fiscal 1988. Her forecast, like that of most analysts, assumes that the Canadian government will eliminate its requirement that banks average their loan losses over five years, thus allowing them to report higher profits.    Profit increases could boost the market values of the six Canadian bank stocks to as much as 1.8 times book value, compared with the current multiple of 1.16, says Mrs. Hallward. By comparison, Keefe Bruyette's Mr. McDermott says Citicorp is &quot;undervalued&quot; trading at 1.7 times book value.    Analysts differ on recommendations for Canadian bank stocks. Mr. Palmer of Alfred Bunting likes Toronto-Dominion Bank because it has the strongest capital base and return on equity. Toronto-Dominion's common equity equals about 5.4% of its assets and Mr. Palmer predicts its return on equity should reach 18% in fiscal 1988.    Wood Gundy's Ms. Meredith recommends Bank of Montreal as the most undervalued stock with a price-earnings multiple of about 5.5 times estimated 1987 earnings of six dollars a share. Ms. Meredith's earnings forecast excludes the special charge from increased reserves and the five-year averaging formula for loan losses. &quot;The market doesn't recognize what the real earnings are at the Bank of Montreal,&quot; she says. </TEXT></DOC>
