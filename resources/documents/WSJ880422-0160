Gottschalk Jr. (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK SCR </IN><TEXT>   Some investors apparently like nothing better than to spend days hearing about depression, famine and disaster.    That seems to be the case with those who paid more than $500 each to attend four-day conferences at posh hotels in Los Angeles and Las Vegas this week and last.    Economic depression and a 1929-style stock market crash were the prevailing forecasts at Investment Seminars Inc.'s &quot;Fourth Annual Investment Masters' Conference,&quot; in Los Angeles, and &quot;Free Market Economic andamp; Investment Summit,&quot; in Las Vegas. Newsletter editors, money managers and a collection of unusual speakers sketched a bleak future.    ---   &quot;Every person at the conference will lose money in the years ahead,&quot; said Richard Russell, editor of Dow Theory Letters, a newsletter that analyzes market trends mainly on the basis of movements in the Dow Jones stock averages. &quot;The winner will be the person who loses the least.&quot;    Mr. Russell, 63 years old, has received some acclaim because at an Investment Seminars conference in San Francisco last August, he said there was a &quot;50-50 chance that a bear market has begun.&quot; At the Los Angeles conference, he said there is &quot;a 100% probability that we are in a bear market&quot; and that it could last two to 10 years. His reasons: The dividend yields of the stocks in the Dow Jones averages are far too low and their price-earnings ratios far too high. Another indicator: The Dow Jones Utility Average, measuring &quot;the bluest of blue-chip stocks,&quot; peaked in January 1987, he said.    ---   Iben Browning, a Sandia, N.M., writer on the impact of climate on business, was one of the most popular speakers. The 70-year-old newsletter editor sketched a grim portrait of volcanic dust eventually causing famines throughout the world, including the U.S., along with half the world's population dying from AIDS, &quot;for which we will never find a cure.&quot; Another speaker linked economic woes to sunspots.    ---   James B. Stack, an editor of mutual fund newsletters, showed the audience a magazine article headlined &quot;Stock Market Crash Dismissed as Result of Overzealous Traders.&quot; Then he revealed the date of the article: Nov. 2, 1929.    ---   Milton Berg, who managed Oppenheimer Management Co.'s Ninety-Ten Fund to a 94% investment gain in 1987 before leaving to become a partner at Steinhardt Partners, a New York investment firm, didn't predict another market crash. But he said last fall's crash heralded a major bear market that will bottom out in the next year and a half.    Mr. Berg, 34, said he is troubled by the high levels of public and private debt, the increasing number of bank failures and the wave of companies &quot;speculating&quot; by buying back their own stocks instead of saving cash for a rainy day. He said people who criticize Wall Street's computerized trading strategies have missed the point. What worries him is not the programs themselves but the climate of &quot;excessive optimism&quot; that allowed the &quot;speculative&quot; programs to be set up.    Still, Mr. Berg said the next economic slump &quot;won't be as bad as 1929 because we have a weak currency,&quot; so people in other countries holding stronger currencies will still buy our products.    Lest anyone be unduly reassured, though, Mr. Berg also predicted a real-estate crash that will dwarf the stock market's coming debacle, because &quot;real estate is the most leveraged aspect of the economy.&quot; True to his beliefs, he said he is renting a $500,000 New York home for $15,000 a year instead of buying it. He expects real-estate prices to fall for many years.    ---   There will be no refuge for people investing in stocks overseas, according to Stan Weinstein, a Hollywood, Fla., technical analyst who publishes the Professional Tape Reader newsletter. Alluding to the 17th-century speculation in tulip bulbs that cost many Dutch residents their fortunes, Mr. Weinstein said: &quot;If there was ever a tulip waiting to be plucked, the Japanese stock market is it.&quot;    ---   The bearish speakers generally advised investors to sell stocks, pay off debts and put their money in Treasury bills. (One speaker said there was a 25% chance that the U.S. government would default and not pay off its obligations.) A few also recommended gold and gold coins.    There was some disagreement over whether municipal bonds would be safe. Mr. Russell said general-obligation California bonds would survive the disaster. Mr. Berg said investors should make sure any bonds they buy are rated triple-A: &quot;Remember that Detroit defaulted&quot; in 1929, he said.    ---   Of the 200 investors attending the Los Angeles conference, about 95% said in an informal poll on the final day that they were bearish on the market. Many also said they still held stocks, either looking for an opportunity to sell or simply wondering where to put their money if they do sell. Only a few said they were &quot;goldbugs,&quot; or adherents of hard-asset investing. At Investment Seminars' August conference, the audience was about evenly divided between bears and bulls.    The poll caused one of the few bulls at the conference, Norman Fosback, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., newsletter publisher, to say that meant it was time to plunge into stocks full-tilt because the market had reached a psychological bottom.    ---   Al Frank, editor of the Prudent Speculator, a Santa Monica, Calif., newsletter that compiled a strong record in the five-year bull market but got caught fully invested in last October's crash, said he is &quot;a nervous bull,&quot; at least in the short run: &quot;It may not pay to bet against the administration in an election year.&quot; Mr. Frank also said the bears were getting carried away with themselves. &quot;Every scenario is a lose-lose scenario. If business is bad, the stock market will go down. If business is good, interest rates will go up, then the stock market will go down.&quot;    ---   Kenneth Gerbino, a Beverly Hills money manager, blamed the investment newsletter industry for helping to create a negative climate that is holding the stock market down. He said the newsletter publishers know they have to be extremists to draw attention and sell copies, so they are either all-out bulls or all-out bears. The publishers now send out two million to three million pieces of direct mail every month predicting a depression and how to avoid the coming disaster, he said.    &quot;It is a scary market,&quot; Mr. Gerbino said. &quot;But remember that the smartest people in America are buying billions and billions of dollars worth of stocks.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
