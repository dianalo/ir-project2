Law,&quot; is the mom; and Kevin Nealon of &quot;Saturday NightLive&quot; is the dim-witted interloper. &quot;SCTV&quot; alumna Andrea Martin, sporting astrange foreign accent (Middle Eastern? Middle European?) and a pregnancyprosthetic, waddles in and out of several scenes. Whenever she makes anentrance, the camera inexplicably pans to her feet.;   Lauren Bacall, puttingon patrician airs and extending her vowels the length of the Brooklyn Bridge,co-stars as a grand dame of the American theater (there's a famous 1940sBacall black-and-white glossy on the mantelpiece) and Sheridan's character'sex-mother-in-law. A rendition of &quot;Baby It's Cold Outside&quot; -- a duet withBacall and her on-screen granddaughter, Thora Birch -- is one of the mostpainful musical numbers in recent movie memory.;   As the two O'Fallonoffspring -- 7-year-old Hallie and teen-age Ethan -- Thora Birch and EthanRandall exude &quot;professional children&quot; airs at odds with their characters'scripted spunk. Dressed up like a snooty New York rich kid, Birch has none ofthe tomboy charm she brought to her performance in the recent &quot;Paradise.&quot; AndRandall's private school-attending, cotillion-going Ethan is almost asunappealing as his similarly painted role in the early summer flop &quot;Dutch.&quot;;  &quot;All I Want for Christmas&quot; never makes a convincing case as to why Mr. andMrs. O'Fallon divorced in the first place. There are some mumblings about &quot;ourdim yuppie lifestyle&quot; and his desire to lose the suit and open a diner, andthat's about it. (The diner is one of those downtown greasy-spoons where thewaitresses burst into song and the management blithely ignores child laborlaws.);   By failing to establish some sort of animosity, or alienation, or&quot;something&quot; between them, the script's attempts to reunite husband and wifeseem bogus and contrived. We're left wondering why these two handsome,well-off people ever divorced. And we don't really care.;   &quot;All I Want forChristmas&quot; plays to a very common children's fantasy -- there are a whole lotmore children of divorced families today than in 1961, when &quot;The Parent Trap&quot;was released. But it's hard to imagine even the most suggestible youngsterbuying into this film's phony emotionalism and hackneyed holiday spirit.;  Mention should also be made of Leslie Nielsen, who shows up as a departmentstore Mr. Claus. On paper, this may sound like a brilliant stroke of casting,but on-screen -- in his snowy beard and Santa suit -- Nielsen proves to beevery bit as uninspired as the rest of the gang.; All I Want for Christmas;(star) 1/2; Rated: G; Cast: Harley Jane Kozak, Jamey Sheridan, Kevin Nealon,Lauren Bacall; Director: Robert Lieberman; Writer: Thom Eberhardt and RichardKramer; Running time: 1 Hour, 29 minutes  </TEXT><BYLINE>  STEVEN REA, Knight-Ridder News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911108  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  12  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  606  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, November 8, 199100313098,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
