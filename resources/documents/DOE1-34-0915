An assessment of theprototype unit has been made to characterize the process and compareemissions with conventional municipal solid waste incineration techniques.The sampling and analytical program is briefly discussed, covering samplingand analytical methodologies, process operating results, compositionof the pyrolysis gas fuel, and emissions in the pyrolysis gases. Dataare presented to show the impact on air quality if pyrolysis gases wereemitted directly to the atmosphere. An approximate energy balance forthe unit shows that process modifications would be required to producesignificant amounts of pyrolysis gas for use as an engine fuel. 2 figs.,7 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
