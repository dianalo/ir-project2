FINANZIARIA DE BENEDETTI, or Cofide, said it is seeking a partner to take a minority stake in its LATINA ASSICURAZIONI S.P.A. insurance unit.    A Cofide spokeswoman said that talks are continuing &quot;on various fronts to find a minority partner&quot; for Latina. She added that Dumenil-Leble S.A. of Paris, which is 25%-owned by Carlo De Benedetti, is one possible partner; she didn't identify the others.    Cofide owns 58% of Latina, while the rest is traded on the Milan Stock Exchange. The Cofide spokeswoman said it was too soon to say whether Cofide would sell part of its Latina stake, or whether the company would issue new shares to accommodate the new partner.    Latina is the main operating company of the Latina-Finanza andamp; Futuro group, which Mr. De Benedetti created in November as a holding company to group all of his financial-services interests. They include Finanza andamp; Futuro, or Fandamp;F, a group of mutual funds owned 75% by Cofide and 25% by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. of the U.S.; LASA, a real-estate company with the same shareholding as Fandamp;F; and Isefi, a leasing and factoring company owned 35% by Cofide, 35% by an Ing. C. Olivetti andamp; Co. joint venture and 30% by the public.    Separately, a French commercial court delayed until Wednesday its examination of a request that a court official be named to protect the rights of minority holders in Buitoni S.A., whose assets Mr. De Benedetti plans to sell to Swiss-based Nestle S.A. as part of a 1.8 trillion-lire ($1.45 billion) transaction. </TEXT></DOC>
