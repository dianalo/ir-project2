Not exactly everyone's idea of a good time. But, &quot;I'm kindof a numbers fiend, to a large degree,&quot; Mr. Smith explains.</LP><TEXT>   At age 32, the former public accountant suddenly findshimself manager-in-waiting of Fidelity Investments' giantMagellan Fund. And before taking over from the legendaryPeter Lynch, who retires May 31 at age 46 after runningMagellan for 13 years, Mr. Smith will have plenty of numbersto ponder.   Magellan, the nation's largest stock mutual fund, has $13billion in assets, one million account holders and upwards of1,400 stocks. From May 31, 1977, to Feb. 28, 1990, Mr. Lynchguided the fund to a total return of 2,475%, compared with508% for the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-Stock Index, according toFidelity. During the 1980s, the fund's average annual return,including reinvested dividends, was 28% -- far outstrippingthat of any other fund.   So imposing is Mr. Lynch's record that it's been likenedto Babe Ruth's career home run total. And Mr. Smith, whosepassion for statistics has made him something of a sportstrivia buff, must recognize that Mr. Lynch is hanging up hisuniform at a time when the outfield fences are more distantthan ever: Magellan's phenomenal growth, since it was openedto outside investors in 1981 with just $100 million inassets, has made it much harder for the fund to beat themarket averages by any significant margin.   &quot;I've been in the spotlight before,&quot; Mr. Smith saysphilosophically, recalling the brouhaha when a risingFidelity star named Paul Stuka left the Fidelity OTC fund in1986 to start his own firm, and Mr. Smith took over the fund,which now has $700 million in assets. Mr. Smith says he plansto handle his new challenge the way he does his current job:&quot;I try the best I can every day.&quot;   How good is Mr. Smith's best? At Fidelity OTC, Mr. Smith'sefforts have produced respectable results during a periodwhen small stocks generally languished. From June 30, 1986,when he took over Fidelity OTC, through March 22 of this yearthe fund ranks as the fifth best of 46 small-company funds,beaten only by Hartwell Emerging Growth, Janus Venture, Acornand Kaufmann, according to New York's Lipper AnalyticalServices. (Fidelity's advertisements tout Fidelity OTC as the&quot;No. 1 Small Company Growth Fund For 5-Year Performance,&quot; butthat includes the fund's big 1985 gain under Mr. Stuka.)   Mr. Smith, whose fund must ordinarily keep at least 65% ofits assets in over-the-counter stocks, has tended to holdrelatively large-capitalization issues. A study done inOctober 1989 by Chicago's Morningstar Inc. found thatFidelity OTC's median stock holding was a company with amarket value of $878 million. Morningstar, which looked at 63small-company funds, found only three funds with a highermedian market value.   With larger-company stocks outperforming smaller companiesover the past few years, Mr. Smith's attraction to largercompanies -- something he describes as the result ofindividual picks, not a broad strategy -- has clearly paidoff.   Since taking over the fund in mid-1986, Mr. Smith hasmanaged a return of 36% through last Feb. 28, well ahead ofthe 10% return for the Russell 2000, a small-company stockindex.   But while Fidelity OTC has done well for a small-companyfund, the poor performance by smaller stocks means Mr.Smith's record doesn't look so hot when stacked up againstthe big-company stocks that comprise the Sandamp;P 500, whichreturned 50% during the same period. And with small-companystocks out of fashion, continuous outflows since the 1987stock market crash have reduced the fund to roughly half itspeak size.   At Magellan, Mr. Smith will be competing against the Sandamp;P500 -- a benchmark Mr. Lynch managed to beat every yearexcept 1984 and 1987.   Fidelity officials note similarities between Mr. Smith andMr. Lynch. Both rise early, work prodigious hours and seemdevoted to their families and religions. Both keep hundredsof stocks in their portfolios -- Mr. Smith has 350 in theFidelity OTC fund -- and talk to dozens of companies in atypical week. Mr. Smith is roughly the age Mr. Lynch was whenhe took over Magellan.   But there are also differences between the two. Mr. Lynch,a master of the wry one-liner and quotable anecdote, playsthe media almost as deftly as the stock market. Heco-authored last year an investing book and closely monitoredits progress on the best-seller charts, according tocolleagues. Mr. Lynch's modest office in Fidelity'sDevonshire Street headquarters in downtown Boston is normallya chaotic sea of documents and newspapers.   On Friday afternoon, after two days of interviews, Mr.Smith confesses to being weary of talking about himself. Hespeaks in rapid-fire, run-together sentences and looks mainlyat his desktop when he's not checking his two computerscreens. Toward the end of an hourlong interview, he busilysorts through a stack of analyst reports that will provideSaturday night and Sunday homework, leaving his desk as neatas a pin.   Mr. Smith describes his investment approach as similar toMr. Lynch's, and he says it's too early to tell what changeshe might make in the fund. He notes that Fidelity OTC'sportfolio contains several of Magellan's largest positions,including Federal National Mortgage Association, GeneralElectric Co., Entergy Corp., Kemper Corp., Primerica Corp.and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. That overlap will helpease his transition, he says -- as will the availability, atleast initially, of two or three assistants. Like Mr. Lynch,Mr. Smith says many of his investment ideas come fromFidelity's 30 analysts and its other fund managers.   Among the Fidelity OTC holdings that Mr. Smith believescontinue to present attractive buying opportunities areMaxtor Corp., a disc-drive supplier whose technology is&quot;cutting edge&quot; and whose &quot;earnings could explode on theupside&quot;; Nike Inc., a company that &quot;everyone is saying hasmaxed out&quot; but that Mr. Smith sees as having potential forstrong international growth; SNC Group Inc., aMontreal-listed engineering and defense company that Mr.Smith considers a &quot;terrific turnaround&quot;; and Prospect GroupInc., a leveraged buyout firm. Mr. Smith says Prospect hasannounced plans to liquidate, and he estimates the value ofits assets at the &quot;low- to mid-$20s&quot; a share, while the stocktrades at around $15.   Mr. Smith, whose father was a fashion designer in NewYork's garment district, earned an accounting degree at CityUniversity of New York's Queens College and first dabbled instocks while working as a certified public accountant. Hismaster's degree in business administration from theUniversity of Pennsylvania's Wharton School landed him a jobas a securities analyst at Fidelity in 1982. Two years later,he became manager of Fidelity Select Leisure Portfolio.   As an analyst, &quot;The first stock I recommended was GoldenNugget,&quot; and though &quot;not a difficult company&quot; to analyze, &quot;ittook me two weeks,&quot; Mr. Smith recalls. By contrast, Mr. Smithsays, he talked or met with precisely 40 companies in theweek before his Magellan appointment disrupted his routine.&quot;In effect, I analyzed 40 companies,&quot; he says, in what herefers to as &quot;one of those great, efficient weeks.&quot;   Mr. Smith counts Rogers Communications Inc., aToronto-based cable television and broadcasting company,among his best all-time picks. He says he recommended it toother Fidelity managers after visiting the company in 1985,at a time when many people thought it was headed forbankruptcy. Instead, the stock went from around $7 a share to$80 or $90 -- although Mr. Smith admits he bailed out afterhe had tripled his money.   Among his worst picks: convertible securities of CrazyEddie Inc., which he bought for more than $30 and sold ataround $13, as they headed to zero. &quot;I used to shop at thefirst Crazy Eddie&quot; near his New York home, Mr. Smith says. &quot;Istill believe in the concept. I just don't believe in thecompany.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
