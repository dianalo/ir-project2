The list of industrial materials in short supply hasdwindled to a handful, due to both increased capacity andslowing demand, says Bob Bretz of the National Association ofPurchasing Management. That's unusual at this stage of abusiness expansion, when shortages and production bottlenecksoften signal higher inflation and then recession, says NormanRobertson, chief economist of the Mellon Bank, Pittsburgh.</LP><TEXT>   The trend isn't triggering oversupply worries either, saysJerry Jasinowski of the National Association ofManufacturers, who credits &quot;better balance&quot; and moresophisticated inventory controls. It is, however, keepingprices down, says David Littmann of Manufacturers NationalBank of Detroit, noting that price pressure is flat &quot;for thefirst time in many years.&quot; And that, he says, bodes well forlower interest rates.   Environmental worries prompt some shortages. Paper mills,trying to reduce dioxin pollution, scramble for chemicals toreplace chlorine in whitening paper.                                                                                                          PROM SPENDING is strong, but a smaller teen populationlimits the market.   &quot;You can't get more lavish than it has been,&quot; says RichardWiewiorka, of the Fairmont Hotel's Tonga Room, San Francisco,which is sold out almost every weekend from April throughJune. Or can you? The hunt for prom gowns began in Februaryinstead of April this year, with some girls spending as muchas $700, says Jacalyn Dunn of Jacalyn's Lace andamp; Promises,Pittsburgh. Rent-A-Stretch Inc., Hackensack, N.J., cites newdemand for $100-an-hour stretch limos.   Cost per couple: $300 to $1,000, says Your Prom magazine,launched this year to tap the lucrative market. But somebusinesses say lavish spending isn't enough to keep the prommarket growing. &quot;Flat demographics,&quot; explains Michael Kashmanof Gingiss Formal Wear, New York. Bill Gallagher of Town andamp;Country Tuxedos, East Meadow, N.Y., says the graduating classat one local high school dropped from some 700 students 11years ago to only 175.                                                                                                          DOCTORS AND DENTISTS are expected to tell more patients tocharge it.   With traditional credit-card markets nearly saturated,attention is shifting to health care. &quot;It is a tremendousmarket,&quot; but no one has paid much attention to it, says H.Spencer Nilson of the Nilson Report, Los Angeles. Heestimates only 3% of consumers' out-of-pocket medicalexpenses now are charged on credit cards. Why? &quot;Doctors havelooked at themselves as professionals and above creditcards,&quot; says Stephen Getzoff, an Encino, Calif., accountantwho specializes in medical practices.   But that is changing as doctors, under pressure frominsurers and other medical providers, look for ways toimprove cash flow. Visa USA launches a program to woodoctors, designing both new signs and new ways for patientsto pay. Medical credit cards -- such as MedMaster SystemsInc., Logan, Utah -- welcome the Visa push. &quot;It is like beinga Burger King on a McDonald's corner,&quot; says David Whipple ofMedMaster, which also provides back-office services.   Doctors may begin offering patients a discount for cashwhen faced with credit-card fees, Mr. Getzoff says.                                                                                                          HE WEARS THE PANTS but she buys them, says a survey fromMRCA Information Services. In 1989, women bought 78% of men'ssweaters, 71% of men's socks and 70% of men's sport shirts.But they bought only 23% of men's suits, apparently lettingmen pick out their own.                                                                                                          IT LOSES SOMETHING in the translation, admits Di Jin, whois translating James Joyce's &quot;Ulysses&quot; into Chinese. Thevisiting fellow at University of Virginia says puns, literaryallusion and political references make the work particularlyhard for Chinese to understand.                                                                                                          SUPERMARKET SKILLS will be taught in a newmini-supermarket being set up in Walton High Schoolclassroom, New York. Sponsored by Great Atlantic andamp; PacificTea Co. and Cornell University, the project will teachstudents to price units, stock shelves and process orders.                                                                                                          WOMEN ATHLETES find more equipment designed just for them.   Women who used to settle for men's sports gear arestarting to demand their own, says Patricia Hubbard, editorof Outdoor Woman, Nyack, N.Y. Sporting-goods manufacturersare responding with everything from specially-sized kayaks tofly-fishing rods for women. Orvis Co., Manchester, Vt.,recently came out with a pair of lightweight women's wadersin fashionable burgundy. Sawyer Canoe Co. offers models thatcan be portaged and maneuvered solo by a 110-pound to150-pound person.   Why the interest? &quot;Sporting-goods manufacturers haverecognized that the men's niche has topped out,&quot; says MissyPark, president of Title 9, a Berkeley, Calif., mail orderhouse that caters to &quot;athletic women.&quot; But some retailershave a hard time selling women's gear, she says, becausethey're used to targeting men.   More women outfitters are organizing women's expeditions,says Ms. Hubbard, noting it's often easier to learn skillswhen men aren't around.
