But a spokesman for the lord advocate ``firmly refuted'' reportsthat police have gathered enough evidence to charge severalsuspects in the Dec. 21, 1988, bombing of the New York-bound flight.   The Sunday Times of London said that despite their cautiouspublic statements, Scottish investigators told a secret,five-nation summit of security services that ``charges are nowpossible against certain persons.''   The report said that police heading the international manhunttold the meeting in Meckenheim, West Germany, that because ofextradition obstacles, some suspects might have to be tried abroad.   The newspaper said leaders of security services in Britain, WestGermany, the United States, Sweden and Malta attended the summit.It did not identify the source of its information or say when themeeting occurred.   A spokesman for Scotland's Crown Office, speaking anonymously inkeeping with British custom, said: ``The lord advocate has noevidence before him with which to initiate warrants or extraditionproceedings.''   Lord Fraser and Chief Constable George Esson of the Dumfries andGalloway Constabulary told a news conference on Friday thatconsiderable progress had been made in their investigation but thatno arrests were imminent.   The Pan Am flight originated in Frankfurt, West Germany, andchanged in London to a larger Boeing 747 which exploded overLockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 people on board and 11 on theground. Investigators say the blast was caused by a bomb made of aplastic explosives and packed in a radio-cassette player that wasplaced in a suitcase loaded into a forward cargo hold.   About 40 Lockerbie residents whose houses were damaged in thecrash gathered in the rain Sunday to witness the dedication of astone memorial to the victims.   A piper played a Scottish lament, and three clergymen ledprayers and blessed the red sandstone block memorializing thevictims.   The Sunday Times said police ``have for some time suspected whothe killers are'' but would probably wait until their inquiries arecompleted in three or four months before starting criminalproceedings.   Esson told the news conference he could not put a timetable onhis investigation. He confirmed that Ahmed Jibril's radicalPalestinian group, the Popular Front for the Liberation ofPalestine-General Command, or PFLP-GC, has been underinvestigation. Esson also confirmed investigators' interest inMohammed Abu Talb, a member of another Palestinian group, thePopular Struggle Front, who is in jail in Sweden awaiting verdictsThursday on unrelated bombing charges. The Sunday Times saidScottish police will interview him Monday.   Terrorism experts and Western media say the PFLP-GC may havebeen hired by Iran to avenge the July 1988 downing of an Iran Airjetliner with 290 people aboard, by a U.S. warship in the PersianGulf. Iran has denied involvement.   CBS reported in February that the attack was in revenge for the1986 U.S. bombing of Libya and the U.S. decision to talk with thePalestine Liberation Organization. They said Jibril cleared theoperation with Syrian intelligence and had the full backing of theLibyan secret service.   In his interview with the weekly newspaper Scotland on Sunday,Lord Fraser said criminal trials would almost certainly take placein the United States if it claimed jurisdiction under internationallaw. On Friday, he said it was possible trials could be held inseveral countries.   ``While this is an outrage to Scotland ... I never lose sight ofthe fact that this was intended as a direct assault on Americansovereignty and for that reason I understand the strength of theirfeeling, of their claim to American jurisdiction.''   Lord Fraser was quoted as saying that Scotland would not competewith the United States to extradite suspects from other countries,unless a country holding a suspect refused an extradition requestbecause the United States has the death penalty.   ``If, on the other hand, the United States was in that positionto secure extradition when the United Kingdom couldn't, I wantthese people brought to justice and I wouldn't stand in the way ofanything,'' he was quoted as saying.   Lord Fraser was quoted as saying he considered winding down thepolice inquiry during the summer because of lack of progress, butpolice then discovered new leads pointing to the Mediterraneanisland of Malta.   Unconfirmed news reports have said the suitcase bomb wastransferred to Flight 103 in Frankfurt from an Air Malta flight.Some reported that police have traced scorched clothing and anumbrella in the suitcase to Malta.   Transport Secretary Cecil Parkinson said Sunday that Britain'sairports are more secure now than at the time of the bombing,particularly for American aircraft ``which are regarded as a higherrisk than ours.''</TEXT></DOC>
