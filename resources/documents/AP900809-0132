Appearing thin but healthy, 33-year-old Christen bounded downthe steps of a Red Cross-chartered aircraft that arrived at Klotenairport after a flight from the Syrian capital, Damascus. Hisparents and four brothers and sisters rushed onto the tarmac toembrace him.   He was handed over to Syrian officials Wednesday after 10 monthsFellowSwiss hostage Elio Erriquez, who was abductedOct. 6 with Christen, remains a captive.   Before beingin captivity.  abducted, both men worked as orthopedic techniciansat a Red Cross hospital in the southern Lebanese port of Sidon.   ``It's very difficult for me to accept that Elio is still incaptivity today,'' Christen told a news conference less than 90minutes after arriving in Switzerland. ``We had hoped to be freedtogether.''   At his arrival, Christen was greeted by Swiss Foreign MinisterRene Felber and Cornelio Sommaruga, president of the InternationalCommittee of thny who left Kuwait forSaudi Arabia on Aug. 3, one day after the invasion.   During the 75-minute drive, Whitaker said, Iraqi soldiers ``werelined up all along the road and they had tanks. They had machineguns and rifles. It was an army.''   The group was stopped twice by Iraqi soldiers. The second time,``I just acted like I didn't hear him and kept going,'' saidWhitaker, who returned Sunday to Abilene.   ``There's no order back in Kuwait. Nobody goes to work, there'sno police, no services. We don't intend to go back there,'' saidKimberly El-Zahr, 29. She, her husband, Camille, 33, and two youngchildren arrived Wednesday in Los Angeles after escapingIraqi-occupied Kuwait. The family plans to stay with relatives inOregon for now.   The estimated 3,400 Americans still in Kuwait and Iraq left manyloved ones in this country ignorant of their whereabouts andcondition.   Bush received high marks in the latest ``Pulse of America''survey conducted in Lubbock County, Texas _ the president's adoptedsounding board for America.   Sixty-four percent of 400 people surveyed Aug. 6-8 said theywould support Bush if he opted to use military force to push Iraqout of Kuwait. Twenty-one percent did not support military use, 12percent were undecided and 3 percent had no answer. The survey,sent to Bush on Thursday, was conducted by Southwest ResearchAssociates and has a 4 percent margin of error.   Laureen Utz Aljazireh, who moved to Kuwait from Springfield,Minn., but was visiting American relatives at the time of theinvasion, also supports the president.   ``I'm glad America is stepping in to stop (Iraqi leader Saddam)Hussein before he continues into Saudi Arabia,'' she said. ``Livingin Kuwait, reading the newspapers there, you got more of a sense ofhow powerful Hussein is.''   Aljazireh's husband, Manhal, is an oil refinery engineer inKuwait, and she has not heard from him since the invasion.   Bobby Parker, 48, is one of 38 Americans being detained in aBaghdad, Iraq, hotel. ``I am very frightened for him and I'mconcerned for the troops and their families,'' said his wife, LyndaParker of Beaumont, Texas.   All 38 were reported to be in good condition.   Arab-American groups were divided in their reaction to U.S.military action.   ``We are U.S. citizens and we share the same concerns and feelthe same economic consequences as all citizens living in thiscountry. Furthermore, many U.S. Chaldeans have relatives stillliving in Iraq. This gives us cause for even greater concern,'' theDetroit-based Chaldean Federation of America said in a statement.Chaldeans are Christian Arabs, mostly from Iraq.   ``Our confidence is behind President Bush and the government ofthe United States of America.''   ``All it takes is a manufactured Bay of Tonkin or an accidentand we're in another Vietnam,'' radio and televison personalityCasey Kasem, who is of Lebanese heritage and often speaks out onArab issues.   ``Gunboat diplomacy is not what the '90s is all about. Shootingfrom the hip is not what the 90s is about. It's the age ofreason,'' he said.   M.T. Mehdi, president of the American-Arab Relations Committeeand the National Council on Islamic Affairs, and about 30 otherArab leaders held a news conference Thursday in New York City. Themetropolitan area has about 200,000 Arab-Americans.   He said about 60 percent were anti-Saddam, about 40 percent pro,but they unanimously opposed the American military deployment.   ``We feel it will increase Arab and Muslim hostility to the U.S.and only increase Saddam Hussein's prestige in the Arab world,''Mehdi said. ``We're all convinced the route to a solution isthrough the U.N., not the U.S.''   Mehdi said most Arab-American leaders in the area favor economicsanctions.   Ten members of the American Friends Service Committee held avigil in Atlanta on Thursday to protest the U.S. militaryintervention. Members of AFSC, a Quaker pacifist organization, saidthey want Iraq out Kuwait but oppose American troops being sent toneighboring Saudi Arabia.</TEXT></DOC>
