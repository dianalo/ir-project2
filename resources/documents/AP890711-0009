That concert was repeated Monday night as the first of three``Landmark Jazz Concerts at Carnegie Hall'' to be recreated thisweek.   ``Black, Brown and Beige,'' played by an 18-piece All-Star JazzOrchestra conducted by Maurice Peress, sounded most impressive.   Because of some familiarity with it and with later extended,symphonic compositions by Ellington, the 1989 audience probablyappreciated it more than its first hearers.   ``Black, Brown and Beige'' begins with ``Work Song'' and ``ComeSunday.'' Frank Wess played ``Come Sunday'' on a saxophone JohnnyHodges used to use. Words to ``Come Sunday'' came later. The onlysinging in ``Black, Brown and Beige'' is ``The Blues,'' sungoriginally by Betty Roche and Monday by the impressive MelodeeSavage.   Peress said Ellington wrote a 30-page narrative about a mythicalcharacter going from slavery to Harlem which included the lyrics to``The Blues.'' Peress said the composer switched from his originalintent, opera, to the instrumental ``Black, Brown and Beige.''   Ellington's introduction to each of the piece's three parts wasrecorded and played to Monday's audience. Ellington didn't fullyexplain his intentions, always assuming that his audience wasknowledgeable, but his introduction was instructive.   Concerts were longer in 1943 than today. The first half alsoincluded musical portraits of three black entertainers and theseven-minute ``Black and Tan Fantasy.'' After that, Ellington surelyintroduced the saxophone, trumpet and trombone soloists; it wasn'tdone on Monday.   The second half had a number of ``concertos'' _ pieces about fiveminutes long that Ellington composed as solos for certain players,accompanied by the band. Milt Hinton played ``Jack the Bear,''written for Jimmy Blanton, who died before the 1943 concert. Tenorsaxophonist Bill Easley played Ben Webster's part on ``Cotton Tail.''   Jon Faddis made his trumpet speak in ``Boy Meets Horn,'' a piecethat's evocative. Faddis was as impressive there as he was innumbers calling for him to be fast and flashy. Sir Roland Hannaplayed piano. Miss Savage's hard swinging of ``Rose of the RioGrande,'' which Ellington didn't write, was so good that Peress hadher repeat it.   The series of concertos lacked a needed spark of excitement thatEllington's stage style undoubtedly added in the original concert.The evening ended beautifully with Hinton, clarinettist JimmyHamilton, who played in the Ellington Band for 26 years, Faddis andtrombonist Dave Bargeron in front of the band, blending on ``MoodIndigo.''</TEXT></DOC>
