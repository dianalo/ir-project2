Police announced on Wednesday they had made their biggest armsseizure ever in connection with the arrests of three men and onewoman who allegedly were acting on behalf of the ANC's militarywing.   The four suspects also had a ``hit-list'' of top policeofficials, according to police.   Arms seized included a Soviet-made SAM-7 ground-to-air missile,limpet mines, hand grenades, assault rifles, pistols, machine guns,mortars and explosives, police said.   They said the four had planned to use the missile to shoot downa police helicopter at a recent fair.   Police have not released the suspects' names, but have said thethree men are South African citizens and the woman is a foreigner.The four are college educated and in their 20s and 30s, policesaid, adding that two are military draft dodgers and one is aformer journalist.   The Citizen, a pro-government daily, said without citing sourcesthat at least one of the four was believed involved in ANC attackscarried out in the early 1980s.   The mostly black ANC was outlawed in South Africa in 1960 andbegan a sabotage-and-bombing campaign the following year aimed attoppling white-minority rule.   Tom Lodge, a leading authority on the ANC and a lecturer at theUniversity of the Witwatersrand, said the arrests illustrate ``thecontinuing trend of young, well-educated liberal and left-wingwhites (to) identify themselves with the ANC.''   Lodge said white participation in the ANC's military wing``obviously has a greater impact on the attitudes of white SouthAfrica than the involvement of blacks.''   Few whites have been involved in the ANC's military operations,although there have been several highly publicized cases in recentyears.   Following a March 17 car bombing that killed three people,police said the leading suspect was Heinrich Grosskopf, a whiteSouth African and an alleged ANC member who remains at large.   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok described the four suspectsas ``a highly specialized terror unit.'' He alleged that thesuspects had been trained in Moscow, Cuba and Angola, and had radiotransmitters which they used to communicate with ANC headquartersin Lusaka, Zambia.   He said they were captured Sunday at a farmhouse near Pretoria,where they had been staying since early this year.   The South African Press Association, citing unidentified policesources, said a disenchanted ANC member apparently gave authoritiesthe tip that led them to the four suspects.   Vlok said police still were investigating how the weapons werebrought into South Africa, but he said the arms came overlandthrough Zambia and Botswana.   Police have announced numerous arrests of alleged ANC members inrecent months and say they have substantially weakened the group'sability to operate inside South Africa.   There have been more than 70 bombings in South Africa since anationwide state of emergency was imposed in June 1986, but thefrequency has fallen sharply in recent months.</TEXT></DOC>
