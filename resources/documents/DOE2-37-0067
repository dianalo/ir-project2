The Ge resistance thermometer sensitivity wascontrolled and optimized by varying the deposition speed and by thermalprocessing. For a weak link, half-mil-diameter NbTi wires were used withelectrical contracts by silver epoxy bonding. Coverages could be controlledby equilibrium with an adjacent exfoliated graphite ballast cell. TheGe metal-film resistor and weak link allowed the cell to be baked upto 300C in a low-temperature environment. Several measurements of filmheat capacity were made around the ordering transition. The criticalexponent of the tallest peak is consistent to previous measurements ofthe tree state Potts models when the in-situ baking temperature was 250C.</TEXT></DOC>
