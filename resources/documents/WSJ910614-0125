The U.S. military showing, the first ever for the Army andNavy at the world's most popular air show, highlights growingefforts by arms makers and Western nations to promote weaponsexports as defense budgets rapidly shrink.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;They are becoming more conscious of the needs of theexport market,&quot; explained Joel Johnson, a vice president ofthe U.S. Aerospace Industries Association.   Mr. Johnson noted that the assembly lines for several ofthe most well-known weapons from the Persian Gulf War --including the M1 tank, the Bradley fighting vehicle and theApache helicopter -- are likely to shut down within the nextfew years unless foreign sales keep them going. Meanwhile,the next generations of those weapons system are likely toremain on the drawing boards for a while, according toPentagon officials, because of slowdowns in militaryprocurement.   &quot;The military needs foreign buyers to keep their optionsopen,&quot; said Mr. Johnson. Although the gathering here iscalled an air show, it features all kinds of armaments.   Several major U.S. defense contractors, including GeneralDynamics Corp. and Raytheon Co., have cut back theirpresentations here, citing budgetary reasons. And no U.S.vendor wanted to go to the expense of flying a U.S. warplaneover the runway at Le Bourget airport during the air show.&quot;We believe that it's better for our bottom line to put themoney into direct sales,&quot; explained one aircraft companyofficial, who asked not to be identified.   But smaller U.S. vendors are filling the gap, preparingover 300 of the 1,700 exhibitions here. It is the largestnumber of U.S. companies ever to appear at the air show,which is held every year, alternating between France and theUnited Kingdom.   David Bowie, a U.S. Commerce Department official whoorganized the U.S. pavilion, said he expected 22,000businessmen to visit it. The pavilion was crammed withweaponry and video displays highlighting U.S. triumphs in theGulf War.</TEXT></DOC>
