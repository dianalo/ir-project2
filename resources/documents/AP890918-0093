(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The state Health Department spiked plans touse 30 seconds of donated music in an AIDS prevention video after aunion said the musicians had to be paid for their work.   The squabble spoiled plans to send the video to every junior andsenior high school in New York state for the beginning of the schoolyear, according to Health Department spokesman Peter Slocum.   ``Based on our past history and experience, it had never occurredto us that we would have run into this situation,'' Slocum said.   The department had hoped that 10-second snippets of three popularsongs would lend a more realistic view to the video. The artists andtheir record companies gave the state permission to use the songsfor free, but the American Federation of Musicians said no.   The union said it had an obligation to make sure its members werepaid for their work, and didn't want to set a precedent. The HealthDepartment said the union had no spirit of public service.   New York state schools are required to teach children about AIDS,and the video prepared by the Health Department was designed to bepart of that curriculum.   Titled ``Flashback,'' the video shows teen-agers being told aboutthe ways they can contract acquired immune deficiency syndrome,usually spread through sexual contact or the sharing of needles.   One ``flashback'' shows a teen-age party. For background, thevideo producers wanted to include brief portions of three songs:``Stand by Me'' by Ben E. King, ``A Shoulder to Cry On'' by TommyPage and ``Oh Yeah'' by Yello.   ``We felt that using songs that kids would recognize and that arepopular for the students would lend reality to the situation andincrease the level of interest,'' Slocum said last week.   But when the department sought union permission, in what itexpected to be a formality, the union unfurled its price scale. Therates include $80.23 an hour for a musician and $160.46 for anarranger.   With 17 union musicians used in the recording of ``A Shoulder toCry On,'' the union calculated the Health Department owed $2,361.17.``Stand By Me'' would cost a relatively economical $1,661.56.   Health Department officials said they didn't bother to ask thecost of using ``Oh Yeah.'' They just said ``Oh no'' to using themusic.   ``We were very surprised because our experience at the HealthDepartment has been that we've received wonderful cooperationthroughout the years, not just in AIDS, but in all of our publicservice announcements,'' Slocum said. ``We've never been turned downbefore.''   Patrick Havey, assistant to the president for the AmericanFederation of Musicians, said the union can't set a precedent byrefusing to insist on payments for work performed.   ``We as a union don't have a right to compromise the rights ofmusicians whose prerecorded music is used,'' Havey said. ``We don'twant anyone to feel that we're singling out the Department ofHealth, because we're not. We've taken this position consistentlydown the line.''   The Health Department said it would use ``generic'' backgroundmusic that's part of the public domain. The schools should get theirvideos delivered by early November, or two months later than planned.</TEXT></DOC>
