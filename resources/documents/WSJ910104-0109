Included in a package of House rules adopted yesterday wasa requirement that the nonpartisan Congressional BudgetOffice estimate the cost of any bills that provide spendingfor benefit programs or cut taxes. Republicans insist thatthe budget agreement gave that power to the president'sOffice of Management and Budget. Their complaints gave apartisan edge to the first day of the new Congress, and therules package was approved on a straight party-line vote of242-160.</LP><TEXT>   President Bush condemned the House action in a statementyesterday and reiterated his earlier threat to veto anylegislation that included a Congressional Budget Office costestimate. &quot;That they have sought to break the budgetagreement in what is virtually their first act of the 102ndCongress, puts in serious doubt whatever they might say orpromise the American people on other significant issues inthe upcoming session.&quot;   The question of which office is the so-called scorekeeperis critical to enforcing the budget law's pay-as-you-gorequirement. Democratic leaders said they didn't contest theOMB's authority to decide if overall spending caps had beenbreached -- an event that would trigger automaticacross-the-board cuts. But they insisted that negotiatorsleft in dispute who had the responsibility for estimating thecosts of individual bills on taxes or entitlement programssuch as Medicare.   &quot;The Democratic Party has chosen, frankly, to go back ontheir word,&quot; said House Republican Leader Robert Michel ofIllinois. Some Republicans wore buttons that read: &quot;A Deal isa Deal.&quot;   But Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.), chairman of theHouse Ways and Means Committee, countered that congressionalbudget negotiators last year &quot;did not intend OMB to have theright to be involved in the day-to-day activities of theCongress and its committees.&quot;   Other Democrats, including Budget Committee Chairman LeonE. Panetta of California, argued that Congress's budgetoffice had a better track record of accuracy and objectivity.   The impact of the House action is likely to be limitedsince it doesn't apply to the Senate, though senators couldagree to accept the House estimates on various bills.</TEXT></DOC>
