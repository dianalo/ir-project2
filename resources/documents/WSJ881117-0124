Banks, regarded in legal circles as the chief architect of the modern corporate law department, is leaving his post as general counsel of Xerox Corp.    His destination will have some lawyers scratching their heads: He is moving to an outside law firm to train in-house general counsel to cut costs and deal more effectively with outside law firms.    Mr. Banks, 54, will undertake his new practice as counsel at the New York office of Latham andamp; Watkins, a Los Angeles law firm with more than 50 lawyers.    Under his two-year contract with the firm, which begins Jan. 1, Mr. Banks will offer his services to corporate legal departments -- and, while he's at it, try to persuade them to install a document-management system made by Xerox that he contends will help them slash their legal costs. If the clients decide to buy the computers, Xerox sales representatives will take over and negotiate a deal.    Mr. Banks says that he and Xerox have not yet worked out how, or if, he will be compensated when a corporate department purchases a Xerox system. But as part of the arrangement, Xerox has agreed to install its document-management computer system in Mr. Banks's office at Latham.    Clinton R. Stevenson, Latham andamp; Watkins's managing partner for more than 20 years, is relinquishing managerial responsibilities to work with Mr. Banks on his project. &quot;For corporate law departments, it is a unique opportunity to get both sides of the picture, from a manager of a law firm and a manager of an in-house department,&quot; says Mr. Stevenson.    Mr. Banks, who is taking early retirement from Xerox, joined that company in 1967 as a senior antitrust attorney after a six-year stint with Du Pont Co.'s legal department. Named head of Xerox's law department in 1976, he pioneered the use of a variety of cost-cutting innovations that are now standard practice among in-house lawyers.    He also co-founded in 1981 the American Corporate Counsel Association. The organization, which now has 7,500 members, has helped improve the stature of in-house lawyers, who have traditionally been perceived as somewhat inferior to their counterparts at law firms.    Mr. Banks says he has long been frustrated by that notion. When he joined Xerox, in-house lawyers were required to submit any work to the outside attorneys for approval. As far back as law school, a professor had discouraged his ambitions to join a corporate law department, recalls Mr. Banks. &quot;Why don't you want to practice law?&quot; Mr. Banks says the Cornell law professor asked.    When he became Xerox's general counsel, Mr. Banks says he immediately set out &quot;to change the idea that in-house lawyers were second-class citizens and paper shufflers.&quot; He adds, &quot;Corporations need strong in-house lawyers.&quot;    Mr. Banks proved to be just that. Six months after his appointment at Xerox, he rejected the advice of outside counsel to settle a costly antitrust suit filed by SCM Corp. that alleged that Xerox had monopolized the plain-paper copier market. Mr. Banks persuaded Xerox's then-Chairman Peter McColough to go to trial. A jury awarded SCM $37.3 million in damages, but the judge set aside the award and an appeals court in 1981 upheld the judge's decision.    Once the SCM case ended, Mr. Banks turned his attention in-house.&quot;Bob was the first to argue that legal fees should be viewed as another cost of business, and that like any business cost they can be controlled,&quot; says Nancy Nord, executive director of the corporate counsel association.    He began by reducing his own staff by 15%. He also widened the scope of the lawyers' responsibilities and took more cases in-house. To attract top-quality lawyers, he created an eight-year &quot;partnership&quot; track comparable to those at outside law firms and began recruiting at law schools. He also urged the lawyers to join professional organizations and offer free legal services for the needy.    When outside firms were used, recalls Deputy General Counsel Richard S. Paul, Mr. Banks insisted that Xerox lawyers control the direction of the case. He also began requiring that outside firms submit budgets and quarterly reports. If they wanted to exceed their budgets, outside firms had to get in-house authorization.    But computerization of the department turned out to be the biggest money-saver, Mr. Banks says. In 1981 he provided computers to his top eight lawyers and refused to communicate with them except via computer.    Today every Xerox lawyer has a computer. The computerization of such tasks as distribution of documents to all lawyers on the Xerox team, retrieval of documents, and document storage that allows the lawyers to build on past work has saved $15 million in legal fees this year, Mr. Banks estimates.    Mr. Banks hopes that this record will persuade corporate general counsel to retain him. &quot;I know CEOs are after general counsel to be more productive, to keep their costs down,&quot; he says. &quot;I can show them how to do it.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
