The control design presented in thispaper is for both normal operation (e.g., load following and frequencyregulation) and contingencies (e.g., loss of a dc bipole or loss of twonuclear reactors). The design is simple and compact: four control signals,five measurements, and the integrals of two measurements are used tomeet all the objectives and constraints for normal operation and contingencies.The multivariable control coordinates the measurements and controls accordingto the time frame of response and the amount of interactions betweenvariables. This paper describes the model of the system, the multivariablecontrol design, and the nonlinear time domain simulation of the overallsystem performance.</TEXT></DOC>
