The concept is admirable, but in many cases companies fail to develop a performance-measurement system that will achieve the desired result.    First, it must be understood that the evaluation model will influence the employee's behavior, i.e., the employee will attempt to maximize the performance-measurement number(s). Consequently, a single measure of performance is inevitably bound to fail. A classic example is Return on Investment where the percent return can be increased by either increasing the numerator or decreasing the denominator. Multiple measures of performance better ensure goal congruence, i.e., employee and company goals are the same. Second, the employee must have control over the variables used in the performance-measurement model. Unfortunately, many systems include factors such as the allocation of costs, which are not controllable by the employee. In performance-measurement systems, cost allocation is an exercise in futility. Third, the employee should participate in the development of the bonus-based goals. If the goals are perceived as unfair, the incentive system will not encourage optimum performance.    These points are relatively simple, but often ignored, and the central element is human behavior. As Arjay Miller (former CEO of Ford) once said, &quot;All costs walk on two legs.&quot; Performance-measurement systems should influence desired behavior.
