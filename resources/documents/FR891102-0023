A later action (54 FR 37112, September 7, 1989) apportionedsufficient amounts of rock sole (25,000 metric tons) to JVP to providebycatch amounts for additional amounts of pollock, yellowfin sole, and``other flatfish'' which were apportioned to JVP by the same action. Theprohibition of receipt by foreign processors of rock sole taken in a directedfishery remained in effect.During the fall joint venture fishery, the bycatch rate of rock sole inthe yellowfin sole and ``other flatfish'' fisheries has averaged about10 percent. However, recently joint venture vessels have moved into areaswhere they have encountered rates as high as 40 percent. Under the definitionof directed fishing, vessels cannot retain on board an amount of rock soleequal to or greater than 20 percent of the total amount of fish or fishproducts on board (as calculated in round weight equivalents). As a result,large amounts of rock sole are being discarded and wasted by vessels whichreceive groundfish catches composed of more than 20 percent rock sole.This wastage is contrary to Council and NMFS policy.To date, only 48,557 metric tons of the originally specified total allowablecatch (TAC) for rock sole (90,762 metric tons) has been taken by domesticprocessing (DAP) and JVP fisheries combined. Allowing foreign processorsto receive rock sole taken in directed fisheries will not result in overfishingof rock sole stocks because more than sufficient tonnage remains in TACto provide for anticipated catches by DAP and JVP fisheries during theremainder of the year.Therefore, foreign processors may receive rock sole taken in directed fisheries,effective noon, Alaska Daylight Time, October 27, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">Classification</ITAG>This action is taken under the authority of 50 CFR 675.20(b) and complieswith Executive Order 12291.The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries finds for good cause that itis impractical and contrary to the public interest to provide prior noticeand comment. Immediate effectiveness of this notice is necessary to avoidwastage of amounts of rock sole discarded in order to avoid the thresholdestablished for directed fishing. However, interested persons are invitedto submit comments in writing to the address through November 13, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 675</ITAG>Fish, Fisheries, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 16 U.S.C. 1801 <T3>et seq.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: October 27, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Richard H.
