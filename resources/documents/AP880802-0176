A resolution passed unanimously by the 525 bishops saidgovernments ``with influence'' should pressure kidnappers inLebanon to free foreign hostages, who include Anglican church envoyTerry Waite and nine Americans.   Mostakbal, an Arabic-language weekly published in Paris, quotedthe spiritual leader of Lebanon's most radical pro-Iranian ShiiteMoslem group Tuesday as saying American hostages may be freedbefore the U.S. presidential election in November.   Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah's organization is Hezbollah, orParty of God, which is believed to be the umbrella for groupsholding most of the 18 foreign hostages.   Episcopal Bishop Robert C. Witcher of Long Island, N.Y., said hebegan talks in April with Iranian officials accompanying victims ofchemical weapon attacks in the Iran-Iraq war who were taken to NewYork for treatment.   ``I would say from my conversations with the Iranians that theyreally want to solve this problem,'' Witcher said in an interviewafter addressing the Lambeth conference of Anglican bishops inCanterbury.   The resolution, which welcomed U.N. efforts for a cease-fire inthe 8-year-old war, also condemned the use of chemical weapons andsaid ``further use by any country should immediately be met bypunitive sanctions.''   Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, spiritual head of theChurch of England and worldwide Anglican Communion, has made newefforts to free Waite and the other foreigners.   Australian Archbishop David Penman returned last week from Iranand the Rt. Rev. John Brown, bishop in Cyprus and the Persian Gulf,was in Lebanon seeking information about four Iranians whodisappeared in a Christian area of the city in July 1982.   Penman said Monday he believes the Western hostages will bereleased after national elections in November in Israel and theUnited States.   Runcie has tried to learn the fate of the Iranians as part of anattempt to get Iran to use its influence with kidnappers holdingforeign hostages. Unconfirmed reports say the Iranians, allMoslems, were killed.   ``The grief of the families of hostages is universal, knowing noboundaries of religion or nationality,'' he said at the conference.   About Waite, who disappeared in January 1987 after leaving hishotel to negotiate for the release of Americans, Archbishop Runciesaid: ``He was kidnapped more than 18 months ago, 561 days ago, andit is day by day that the families of hostages count their misery.''   The hostage held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent of The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,1985.   Witcher, 61, said he met Iranian officials for the first time atSt. John's Episcopal Hospital in the New York City borough ofQueens _ part of his diocese _ where several Iranian Kurds gassedin the war were treated.   He said in an interview he continued talks with the Iranians``at the hospital, at their office in the embassy and at theirhomes.'' Witcher said he had not discussed the talks with the StateDepartment.   ``They (the Iranians) said they would deliver the message toTehran and left it at that,'' the bishop said.</TEXT></DOC>
