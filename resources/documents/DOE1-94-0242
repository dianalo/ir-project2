The fully automated test facility, whichuses state of the art components supplied by the Institute of Gas Technology(IGT, Chicago), has been operated for more than two years under variousconditions. The objective of these tests was to establish the performanceand the endurance at lower than baseline T (923 K). It was reasoned that,since the most important rate processes affecting component's durabilityand cell's performance are marked by high activation energies, a betterunderstanding of phenomena so occurring would constitute a referencefor a preliminary evaluation of the attractiveness and limits of loweroperating temperatures. Results obtained from a series of runs at 893K are reported including post-mortem analyses of components after thesetests, the longest of which lasted ca. 4450 h.</TEXT></DOC>
