The defense, aviation and appliances concern said it hasgiven layoff notices to more than 300 employees in variousU.S. locations this month and expects further cuts througheither layoffs or attrition. The January layoffs bring totalcuts to 1,200, or about 1.5% of its peak work force of 77,600as of Dec. 31, 1989. Employment at the end of 1990 was76,700.</LP><TEXT>   The layoffs, which affect middle-level managers at companyheadquarters as well as manufacturing employees, weren'tannounced but were confirmed by Raytheon in response toinquiries.   Raytheon, the main supplier of the Patriot air-defensemissile deployed in the Persian Gulf, attributed the steps toa slowdown in U.S. defense outlays and overall economicweakness. In addition to its defense business, Raytheon makescommercial aircraft and appliances and sells engineering andenergy services.   A spokesman said the company is trying to reduce costsacross its operating divisions but declined to say whetherthere is an overall target for the amount of cuts.   Raytheon previously reported 1990 net income of $557.3million, compared with $528.8 million in 1989. Sales lastyear rose to $9.27 billion from $8.8 billion. Order backlog,however, fell to $8.81 billion from $9.59 billion, includinga $400 million decline in government orders.   The spokesman said praise for the performance of thePatriot in knocking down Iraqi missiles fired at Saudi Arabiaand Israel -- praise that was echoed in President Bush'sState of the Union address Tuesday night -- hasn't generatedany additional orders since the Gulf war broke out two weeksago. But analysts have said that a pending Saudi Arabianrequest for an additional $1.1 billion in Patriots may get amore favorable review from Congress as a result of the war.</TEXT></DOC>
