As of Tuesday, 52 banks with assets of $4.7 billion hadfailed in 1990. By contrast, at this time last year, 73 bankswith $19.7 billion in assets had failed or received FDICassistance in order to continue operating, Mr. Seidman said.No banks have received such FDIC aid this year.</LP><TEXT>   Last year's figures included 20 bank subsidiaries ofDallas-based MCorp, with assets of $15.6 billion. For all oflast year, 207 banks with $29 billion in assets failed orwere assisted by the FDIC.   Mr. Seidman said in an interview that initial figures showthe FDIC's bank deposit-insurance fund had a loss of about$800 million last year, larger than the $250 million-to-$500million loss he predicted late last year. He said the largerloss stemmed from greater-than-expected costs from the MCorpfailures and from the failure this year of Seamen's Bank forSavings, based in New York. (Under its accounting rules, theFDIC must account for some of those costs in its 1989results.)   That loss will leave the deposit-insurance fund with about$13.2 billion, or about 0.7% of insured deposits. Governmentpolicy is to try to maintain the fund at about 1.25% ofinsured deposits. Final figures on the fund's performancelast year are to be released May 18.   Mr. Seidman said the fund could increase somewhat duringthis year, but the failure of a large bank would probablycause a loss. He wouldn't say whether he was expecting alarge bank failure.   Mr. Seidman, who is also chairman of the Resolution TrustCorp., said the RTC may abandon its policy that permitsbuyers of insolvent thrifts to repudiate rates paid oncertificates of deposit after two weeks. The RTC is theagency charged with selling or liquidating hundreds ofinsolvent thrifts taken over by the government.   In a meeting scheduled for May 18, the agency willconsider requiring buyers to honor CD rates for three months,he said. The policy has recently been recommended to the RTCboard by its staff, he said.   The move would mean that buyers of insolvent thrifts wouldknow exactly the cost of funds from the market, Mr. Seidmansaid, and that depositors -- often big-deposit brokers --would have the assurance that their rates would be locked infor at least 90 days after the thrift is sold. Depositors,for example, would be able to compare rates at insolventthrifts with those of 90-day Treasury instruments, he said.   Eliminating the uncertainty ultimately means lower costsfor obtaining funds and greater liquidity, Mr. Seidman said.&quot;If someone has uncertainty, they are going to require ahigher rate,&quot; he said.   Mr. Seidman said the RTC's ambitious project to sell about140 thrifts by the end of June to get the troubledthrift-industry bailout off the ground is &quot;on schedule.&quot;   He said sales of assets separately from thriftinstitutions were also moving forward, with about $600million in sales last month. But he said rising interestrates may make such asset sales more difficult in comingweeks.</TEXT></DOC>
