Karr (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> CNW LABOR </CO><IN> TRA </IN><G> EXE CNG </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan signed legislation that ended a rail union strike against the CNW Corp. by renewing a cooling-off period in a long-running dispute over crew sizes.    Strikers began leaving their picket lines even before the president signed the bill yesterday afternoon. In the morning, after the legislation passed the House, CNW said it would reinstate workers fired in the dispute.    The strike, originally set for 12:01 a.m. CDT yesterday, began at 9 a.m. CDT after the Chicago-based railroad company agreed to postpone for nine hours firing 1,156 freight crew members, and the United Transportation Union said it would delay its retaliatory strike. Both sides agreed to the delay to give the House time to approve the bill, which the Senate had already passed.    Under rail labor law, certain developments automatically trigger a cooling-off period. The law enacted renews the cooling-off period for 36 days, until Sept. 9. The original period, which expired at 12:01 a.m. yesterday, was ordered as part of Mr. Reagan's naming of a presidential emergency board in April to try to resolve the issue.    A spokesman for Rep. Terry Bruce (D., Ill.) said if the two sides cannot settle their dispute by the end of the revived cooling-off period, Sen. Paul Simon (D., Ill.) and Mr. Bruce would sponsor legislation to enact into law the emergency board's compromise recommendation for resolving the matter.    CNW this week offered to accept the board's recommendation to keep some brakemen on freight trains while trimming crew size to three from four on most of those trains, which are part of the CNW's Chicago andamp; North Western Transportation unit. The CNW has wanted for some time to cut freight crews to two people, saving about $53 million a year, and it took that action briefly yesterday, prior to House passage of the bill.    The union has insisted that reduced crews wouldn't be safe. </TEXT></DOC>
