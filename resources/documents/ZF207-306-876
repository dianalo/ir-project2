 Forty-two per centfelt downtime would cost them up to $1,000 per hour, 26 per cent up to$10,000 an hour, 5 per cent up to $50,000 an hour and 4 per cent put the costat more than $50,000 an hour.andP;  Trying to minimize downtime will, therefore,be important to most companies.andM;So, it would seem that there is an opportunity for an independent body toprovide timely and non-sensationalist 'correct' information to consultants,support staff and users on any potential threats to computer security.andM;In 1988, 65 companies (including Microsoft, Novell, Everex and Unisys)jointly developed guidelines for reliability.andP;  CoTRA is using the conclusionsof these discussions as a basis for its method of working.andM;CoTRA initially came about as a reaction to the hype that has beensurrounding viruses.andP;  The confusion has now reached a point where many quiteinnocent problems are immediately assumed to be due to virus.andP;  The blame forthis state of affairs is often directed at a few consultants who'deliberately spread panic and worried end-users' so that they could thenstep-in, repair the (often non-virus related) damage, and collect a heftyfee.andM;The emergence of an organization like CoTRA should be welcomed.andP;  The industrydoes, at the moment, need an impassive, calm and authoritative front topresent to anyone who comes across a security problem.andM;Unfortunately, the size of the problems was, perhaps, a little underestimatedin the initial entthusiasm.andP;  CoTRA must present its united front on everysecurity subjecT, including hacking, fraud, employee damage, logic bombs,viruses, damage from badly written programs, password-choice, ciphers, andencryption.andP;  And it must provide authoritative information for all types ofcomputer -- from PC to mini and mainframe -- and all sorts of communicationmedia -- stand-alone, LAN, WAN and dial-up.andM;This major undertaking is made worse by the individual way many consultantsview security--should virus-writing methods be released for analysis, or willthis spark-off new virus authors?andP;  Should a list of the 1,000 most usedpasswords be released so that system managers can ban them, or will this helpout hackers?andM;Two of the major problems that the Association will face were made prettyobvious at the inaugural meeeting on March 17 -- which was well attended byaround 50 corporate representatives and consultants.andM;One.andP;  The meeting was, unfortunately, dominated by the subject of viruses.andO;If the Association wants to make any headway it must make a concerted effortto step back a little from this glamorous subject, whose effects are out ofproportion to the media coverage it's received.andM;Two.andP;  It appears that CoTRA will, if it's not careful, get into the securityCatch-22 situation.andP;  This was exemplified by two of its more laudableshort-term objectives.andP;  The first was a register of certified consultants whocould deal with security threats.andP;  How, pointed out one candidate, could wetell the real professionals from those who merely joined to addrespectability to their names?andP;  The solution decided on was a vetting board.andO;But who should be on that vetting board?andP;  Everyone in the room had some axeto grind.andP;  Well, maybe the steering party could select the vetting board whowould then vet the potential consultants.andM;The second was to distribute 'official' CoTRA approved finger-printing disks(write-protected) so that companies could use these as a certain, safe way ofchecking the validity of their idea.andP;  Unfortunately, some present wereconcerned about the integrity of these disks.andP;  People are just going to haveto trust someone, sometime.andM;It looks then as though there is great potential for CoTRA -- it is needednow, but it has to act now.andP;  If the Association can show its authoritativeface from the start, then all the objections above will fade.andP;  The users doneed an independent body to make a stand and bully hardware and softwaremanufacturers into starting to consider security issues in their products.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
