Topics examined include thenumber ratio of He- vs H-dominated atmospheres, the total mass of theH layer, He abundances in DA white dwarfs, H abundances in DBA stars,metal abundances in cool He-rich atmospheres, accretion-diffusion-mixinghypotheses for DZ stars, and C abundances in DQ stars. 46 references.</TEXT></DOC>
