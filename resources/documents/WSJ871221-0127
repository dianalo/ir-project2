But since they lost the presidency to the ruling party's candidate last week, popular enthusiasm for their cause has waned, and they face a small but troublesome mutiny within their divided movement by lawmakers fed up with their quarreling.    Opposition leaders Kim Dae Jung and Kim Young Sam are redoubling their efforts to nullify the victory of the Democratic Justice Party's Roh Tae Woo in the presidential vote, alleging massive fraud. They are refusing even to discuss a date for National Assembly elections, which the government aims to hold around Feb. 10.    However, they find it harder to arouse the political passions they once took for granted. The national mood has turned cynical, reflecting disgust with the two Kims for splitting the opposition. The majority of South Koreans are also unenthusiastic about the new president-elect, who won only 36% of the vote even after mobilizing the government's machinery.    &quot;Many people may not be happy with the outcome, but they are relieved the election is over,&quot; said Seoul National University sociologist Kim Kyung Dong of the violence-ridden campaign. &quot;The whole process was rather unpleasant.&quot; He said people are watching to see whether the opposition can somehow rid itself of the two Kims -- or at least of their divisions -- or whether the ruling party's Mr. Roh can win over the majority of the country, which voted against him, by fulfilling campaign promises to be more democratic than his predecessors.    Hundreds of students stormed police stations and battled riot officers yesterday in the southern city of Kwangju, Kim Dae Jung's stronghold, but calls for protests against the presidential election drew little response elsewhere. At Myongdong Cathedral in central Seoul, students carrying nail-studded two-by-fours and Molotov cocktails formed barriers to guard protesters. Middle-class Koreans, who provided money and food to such demonstrators in June, merely looked on with curiosity, or in one instance started lecturing students that the time for street demonstrations was over.    Even many people who voted for the opposition said they want to give Mr. Roh time to prove he will somehow be more democratic than President Chun Doo Hwan, the man he helped to bring to power in a military coup. Students are less generous, but even they seem subdued. On a small hill at Seoul National University known as the acropolis, only a few students gathered where thousands before rallied against the government.    &quot;Students fear it is almost impossible to turn the tables around now that Roh has been declared winner,&quot; said 25-year-old chemistry student Kwan Young Guen. &quot;People became more disillusioned with the Kims as the campaign went on.&quot;    The government is trying to exploit this disillusion. State television last night showed a long segment of President Carter's 1980 concession speech to Ronald Reagan -- an unsubtle civics lesson on how to accept defeat. Mr. Roh has offered to consult closely with the opposition and has invited the two Kims to meet with him individually, an offer that both have refused.    Nobody is writing off either opposition candidate. Kim Dae Jung in particular has proved himself a master of reversing failing fortunes. &quot;The issue of election cheating will divide the country when people see the truth behind the facade of the false victory,&quot; said an adviser to Kim Dae Jung.    The National Assembly elections are critical because the new constitution grants the South Korean parliament more power than it has ever had. Moreover, the vote will determine how strong a mandate Mr. Roh can muster. It will test whether the two Kims can remain atop the opposition forces, or whether one can emerge as more powerful. Their advisers said the two will again compete for opposition votes with separate parties.    The advisers have been trying since Thursday to bring the two together for a joint attack on the election result. But the deep distrust between them has become so enflamed by the heat of the election that they no longer speak to each other.    Some opposition lawmakers are more than a little concerned about their own political futures. &quot;National Assembly elections are the next big test for us,&quot; one assemblyman said. &quot;We all will be fighting for our own seats. The Kims should be embarrassed enough about their own defeat and stay out of it.&quot;    An opposition reform movement of 12 young maverick assemblymen, led by Cho Soon Hyung and Park Chan Jong, believes both Kims must go. A few members of the group are demanding the two men be called to account for their refusal to agree on a single candidate and for blaming their loss wholly on election fraud.    &quot;I think there was obviously cheating in the election,&quot; said Hong Sa Duk, a reform-minded opposition member previously allied with Kim Young Sam's faction. &quot;But the main reason the two Kims lost was that they couldn't agree on a single candidacy. We tried to tell them over and over, but they wouldn't listen. Now we think it's time for the two Kims to step aside.&quot;    The chances of achieving a unified opposition are considered slim. What is more likely, Mr. Hong and other opposition members said, is that the young lawmakers will break away from the two opposition parties, form a new party and lure disillusioned pragmatists into the new group.    One measure of the changed mood in South Korea is the emergence of former Prime Minister Kim Jong Pil, the presidential candidate who finished a distant fourth, as the hero of the week. Although he also charged the government with election cheating, his party secretary delivered a huge bouquet of flowers to Mr. Roh to congratulate him on his victory.    The owner of a taxi drivers' restaurant in the Yongdong sector of Seoul recalled the scene late last week while her dinner crowd watched the presentation of flowers on the evening news. &quot;They all instantaneously applauded,&quot; she said of her working-class clientele, most of whom voted for Kim Young Sam or Kim Dae Jung. &quot;His popularity went up by showing such a statesmanlike approach. We see so little of that behavior.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
