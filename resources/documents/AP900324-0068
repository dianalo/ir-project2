In the latest blow, the Conservatives have suffered their mostspectacular by-election defeat in 50 years, losing thetraditionally staunch Tory district of Mid-Staffordshire to theopposition Labor Party by a landslide.   Even after Friday's humiliation, Mrs. Thatcher's closestsupporters are convinced she will ultimately triumph. But theThatcherite free-market revolution has hit its roughest patch sinceshe swept to power in 1979.   Mrs. Thatcher has weathered tough spells before. But this time,things look dangerously different for the prime minister who hasdominated Britain through the 1980s and challenged everyinstitution, from the welfare state, through lawyers' monopolies tothe labor unions.   What began as a blip in inflation in the spring of 1988 hasburgeoned into a crisis undermining the core of her politicalsuccess: the sense she gave millions of Britons _ even those whodid not like her _ that they were better off with her.   Thatcher aides argue that the by-election defeat was largely atraditional mid-term protest. But it is an ominous protest in whicha Tory majority of 14,654 became a Labor majority of 9,449 _ aswing of 21.4 percent.   ``There was never a widespread acceptance of her enterpriseculture,'' Robert Skidelsky, professor of international studies atWarwick University, said in an interview.   ``But she was accepted as a very strong leader, someone who hadgot the economy under control and brought a tremendous increase inliving standards in real terms. ... Suddenly all that has startedto come unstuck and her strongest claim to rule is undermined.''   In the past 20 months, a doubling of interest rates in anattempt to curb inflation has sent the cost of home loans and othercredit soaring.   Hardest-hit are millions of new homeowners, small businesses andskilled blue-collar workers _ people who symbolize Thatcherismitself.   Meanwhile inflation, just 3.3 percent two years ago, remainsabove 7 percent.   ``In the beginning I thought her ideas were brilliant,'' saidSheila Jackson, who lives with her husband, a $230-a-weekplasterer, and two children on a public housing estate in Weymouth,southern England.   ``We were going to buy our house this year. Now that's on holdbecause of the interest payments ... you feel you're gettingnowhere with her. I'm ashamed to say I voted for her.''   This sudden loss of spending power is worsened by a property taxreform that was supposed to be Thatcherism's master stroke, but islooking like a serious political miscalculation.   By changing the system from graded levies on property to astraight head tax on every adult, Mrs. Thatcher thought she couldshow voters that Tories run local government more cheaply than theLabor socialists.   Instead, the so-called poll tax is costing the average householdabout one-third more _ $1,107 _ from April 1.   Demonstrators have fought running battles with police andinvaded town halls all over England. The Conservatives have sunk totheir lowest ratings for nearly two decades, 21 points behind Labor.   The 64-year-old prime minister faces a fundamental quandary. Shehas built her prestige on a refusal to shirk unpopular measures forthe sake of popularity. To back down is simply not in her nature.   But unless she relents on the tax, she will alienate voters aswell as members of her own party, who fear for their seats in thenext election.   Many Britons have long regarded Europe's first woman primeminister as dogmatic, bossy and extreme. Surveys marking her 10thanniversary in power last May showed majorities still oppose somekey tenets of her mission to demolish socialism, such as sellingoff state-owned industries and reforming the national health,education and legal systems.   But until now, the grocer's daughter from Grantham, centralEngland, could demonstrate that whatever the intelligentsiathought, she was in touch with ordinary people: tough on crime,patriotic enough to wage war for an obscure colony like theFalkland Islands, strong enough to face down powerful trade unions.   The new tax has made even her staunchest supporters wonder.   ``It was a blunder, putting at risk for the first time Mrs.Thatcher's claim to be the authentic voice of middle England,''Peregrine Worsthorne commented in London's right-wing SundayTelegraph.   No one is writing off Mrs. Thatcher's chances of leading theConservatives to an unprecedented fourth successive victory at thenext election, which must be held by mid-1992.   ``I am very happy in the business I do, very happy indeed,'' shesaid recently.   Last November, however, she faced a challenger for the firsttime at the annual election of party leader. Although she wonhandsomely, there is now at least a possibility her critics willtry again this year. If she loses, she automatically ceases to beprime minister.   ``The idea that Mrs. Margaret Thatcher may no longer be primeminister by the autumn must now be taken seriously,'' said therespected weekly, The Economist.   The favorite as successor is Michael Heseltine, 57, acharismatic former defense secretary who projects himself as theTory who will usher in a kinder, gentler post-Thatcherite age.   Thatcher aides argue that inflation and interest rates willinevitably fall by year's end, if only because the government mustcreate a pre-election recovery. But even then, Mrs. Thatcher seemsin for a much tougher ride.   She is in some ways a victim of her own successes.   Many Britons have forgotten or never knew life without her, whenBritain was plagued by strikes, inflation touched 26 percent andthe top income tax rate was 83 percent.   Now, more than two-thirds of Britons own their homes, comparedwith 50 percent in 1979. Stock holders have trebled to 9 million,largely through sales of state-owned enterprises, including BritishAirways, the national phone company, and British Gas.   The average Briton's earnings, now $388 a week, have risen by 26percent in real terms since 1979, according to official figures.</TEXT></DOC>
