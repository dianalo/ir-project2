Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Hisham Nazer, emerged from a sessionof the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and said thedeal was formally completed.   All 13 members of the cartel signed the accord, which sets atarget price of $18 a barrel although crude has been selling at $14a barrel and less.   Analysts have said the agreement, which goes into effect Jan. 1and runs for six months, could send crude prices climbing by $1 or$2 a barrel.   Each $1 rise in the price of crude oil theoretically means anincrease of 2.5 cents a gallon in retail gasoline prices, althoughoil companies do not always pass along the full increase.   The agreement sets the cartel's total production at 18.5 millionbarrels a day in the first six months of the year. It currently isrunning at 22.5 million barrels a day.   The ministers' aim is to curtail their production in an effort toreduce the glut on the market and lift sagging prices.   OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman said the accord would have a``positive, very positive'' effect on the oil market and predictedprices could reach $18 a barrel ``maybe by June.''   If all 13 countries curb their production as provided under theaccord, prices will get a strong lift, he said.   ``It's a hell of a lot of oil to take out of the market,'' hesaid. ``It should shock the price sharply up very quickly.''   Saudi Arabia had tried to set a minimum price of $15 in theaccord, but that effort met resistance.   Nazer said late Sunday the Saudi proposal was designed to preventprices from falling below $15. But other ministers said the minimumprice could become the ceiling price.   Barkeshli said Sunday the Saudi proposal was ``a major divergencefrom OPEC resolutions so far'' and could ``totally sabotage theagreement.''   ``Iran is not going to accept this type of idea,'' he said.   Under the accord, each country would be given a production quota,or ceiling, within the total limit of 18.5 million barrels a day.   Many OPEC countries need more money from their oil sales. Iranand Iraq want additional revenues to rebuild their economies, whichwere badly damaged in their eight-year war. They agreed to an Augustcease-fire.   Under the new agreement, Iran and Iraq each will get the samequota of 2.64 million barrels a day.   Iraq had been demanding an equal production ceiling with Iran,which repeatedly said no.   Under the new accord, Iran will retain its production share at14.27 percent of the cartel's total output. Other countries wouldgive up some of their share to bring Iraq up to the same level asIran.   Saudi Arabia maintains the largest share at about a quarter ofOPEC's total output.   Under the current accord, Iran has a cap of 2.4 million barrels aday. Iraq was given a ceiling of 1.5 million barrels but ignored it.Analysts estimate its production at 2.7 million barrels a day.   OPEC members are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates,and Venezuela.</TEXT></DOC>
