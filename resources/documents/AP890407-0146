Police said they arrested four strike leaders, bringing to 19the number detained this week. They continued to hunt for another12 leaders Friday, the day after senior government officialsordered they suppress leftists accused of arousing workers.   In Seoul, 2,500 students demanding Roh's resignation rallied atfour schools and pelted police with hundreds of firebombs.   One bomb went astray and burned out a store in front of SungshilUniversity. No casualties were reported.   Hundreds of riot police firing tear gas moved into SungkyunkwanUniversity, near downtown Seoul, to disperse about 700 students whotried to march off the campus to support the Hyundai strikers.   ``Overthrow the Roh regime, which stifles workers' rights,''shouted students protesting police action against strikers at SouthKorea's largest shipyard, the Hyundai Heavy Industries in thesoutheastern industrial city of Ulsan.   Shipyard operations remained far below normal Friday, althoughthousands of riot police increased protection for non-strikers.   Police said protesters hurling firebombs set an Ulsan policecheckpoint afire in a pre-dawn attack. No serious property damageor injuries were reported.   According to Hyundai officials, 2,000 workers and sympathizersstaged scattered protests in Ulsan. News reports said riot policebrandishing truncheons and shields chased them into alleys andsidestreets. Demonstrators appeared subdued, apparently because ofincreased police activity, the reports said.   Police squads patrolled residential areas and companydormitories they closed Thursday because militant workers wereusing them as hideouts.   The police also blocked all traffic to the city, checking busesand other vehicles to keep out dissidents and radical students fromother parts of the country, state TV reported.   Hyundai's labor troubles began in December when militant workersleft a company-sanctioned labor union to strike for more pay andbetter working conditions.   About 2,000 workers from the company's 20,000-member workforcehave demonstrated daily since riot police stormed the shipyardMarch 30 to end the 109-day strike.   Seoul demonstrators also shouted slogans supporting dissidentclergyman Moon Ik-hwan, who made an unauthorized trip to NorthKorea last week and held talks with North Korean President Kim IlSung on reuniting the divided Korean peninsula.   Government officials say the Rev. Moon will be arrested andcharged with violating security regulations when he returns. Moonis in Tokyo and told reporters he plans to return home by Thursday.   Dissidents and students are organizing rallies to welcome Moon,but police say they will block them.</TEXT></DOC>
