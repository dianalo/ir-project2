The 70 Soviets, who arrived Friday night at Travis Air ForceBase in northern California, departed in small groups Sunday fortwo sites in Arizona, and one each in Utah, Colorado and SouthernCalifornia, said Travis spokesman Capt. Tom Dolney.   A group of U.S. inspectors traveled to the Soviet Union at thesame time to begin their work under the treaty signed by PresidentReagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev last December.   Under the complex procedures outlined in the treaty, the Sovietshad the right to conduct spot checks at the five sites thisweekend, and they didn't have to say how many of them they wantedto visit until the last minute.   The Soviets, Dolney said, chose to send teams to all five sites:   _The Pueblo Army Depot Activity in Pueblo, Colo.   _A General Dynamics plant in San Diego.   _The Dugway Proving Ground, a remote Army installation in thewestern Utah desert.   _A cruise missile testing and training site at Fort Huachuca,Ariz., about 60 miles south of Tucson.   _Davis-Monthan Air Force Base near Tucson, Ariz., a missiletraining center.   Teams also plan to visit several sites in the Eastern states,but the Soviets have yet to announce those locations.   The so-called ``baseline inspections'' verify informationprovided during the treaty negotiations. The Soviets may spend upto 24 hours at each site, U.S. officials said.   At Dugway Proving Ground, where the cruise missile was testfired, spokeswoman Kathy Whittaker said the 10 Soviets notified thebase of their impending visit about 2:30 a.m. MDT Sunday. Theyarrived less than 3{ hours later, and completed their inspectionabout 4:15 p.m., she said. Later, they headed for Travis.   ``There's not much out there for them to see'' since the sitewas stripped after the last cruise missile test firing, she said.   Whittaker said the inspection not only fulfilled the``baseline'' provision of the treaty, but also served as the``close-out'' inspection to ascertain that activities banned underthe treaty have ceased.   In San Diego, 10 inspectors arrived at General Dynamics Plant 19to see what was once the Ground Launch Cruise Missile LauncherAssembly and Program office. Those operations were discontinued inDecember 1987, said Air Force Lt. Col. J.B. Kump.   In Arizona, spokesmen at Davis-Monthan and Fort Huachuca saidthe visits were extended from 24 to 32 hours by mutual consent.Each base was visited by a team of 10 Soviets.   In addition to the brief spot checks at the five sites, a groupof 22 Soviet on-site inspectors was welcomed Saturday to Salt LakeCity to begin its check at the Hercules Aerospace Co. missile plantin Magna, Utah, where Pershing II missiles banned under the INFTreaty were produced.   The inspectors assigned to the Hercules plant will be the onlypermanently based Soviets, who can stay for up to 13 years underthe treaty.   The INF pact, the first to allow such on-site inspection, isviewed as a trial for the proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty,which would slash arsenals of long-range superpower nuclear weaponsby 30 percent to 50 percent, and involve much more complicatedverification procedures.</TEXT></DOC>
