(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man who took three hostages at acounty courthouse and threatened to blow the building upsurrendered today, after releasing his captives and reporting thathis wife killed herself, police said.   Kevin Patrick Firth, 30, was taken into custody at 9:15 a.m.,Police Sgt. Greg Kuhn said.   Authorities were uncertain, pending an autopsy, whether HelenFirth shot herself or was shot by her husband, Mesa County DistrictAttorney Steve ErkenBrack said.   ``She's gone. Helen's shot,'' said Firth told police earlierthis morning.   Police said Mrs. Firth had smuggled guns and possibly explosivesinto the Mesa County Courthouse Tuesday just before her husbandfaced a hearing in a sexual assault case.   After Firth surrendered, a bomb squad began searching thecourthouse but didn't immediately find any explosives. ErkenBracksaid hostages had reported seeing wire, tape and round objectsinside the courthouse. ``There apparently was something there tomake the hostages believe there were explosives,'' he said.   The last of the hostages had been released three hours beforeFirth reported the shooting. Firth would not permit a doctor toenter the building.   Firth appeared willing to give up at about 3:30 a.m. but hiswife balked and threatened many times to detonate explosives shehad smuggled into the two-story building.   At 5:10 a.m., Firth reported his wife had shot herself. Whennegotiators tried to calm him down, he said, ``I can't. I've got tobe with her. It's too late.''   After several minutes, negotiator John Hakes asked Firth to callon the telephone, but Firth refused and said: ``Get everybody offor I'll blow this ... building. Helen's about gone.''   Later in the morning, Firth agreed to negotiate by telephone.The last thing he was heard saying over the radio was: ``Why didyou push her? Was time all that important?''   Police refused to report the substance of telephoneconversations between negotiators and Firth.   All business was canceled at the courthouse today and businessesfacing the courthouse were asked not to open.   ``I thought I was going to die,'' said Sheila Shumway, a courtclerk who was the first hostage released on Tuesday. ``I blame thaton the county commissioners. We begged and begged for security andit's always been money to them. Maybe they'll do something now.   ``I'm not going to work there again until they get me somesecurity. I wasn't hired to wear a bullet-proof shield,'' she saidin a telephone interview today.   Tuesday's ordeal began as Firth's handcuffs were taken off priorto a pre-trial hearing. Mrs. Firth pushed a jailer and handed herhusband a semi-automatic pistol, keeping a second for herself.   They took as hostages clerks Joyce Bailey and Shumway andreceptionist Linda Romersberger. Shumway was released about noon,and Romersberger was freed about 8 p.m.   During the ordeal, police said Firth, 30, made no demands,except to talk with investigators about the sexual assault caseagainst him.   As the night wore on, Firth approached the brink of releasinghis captives several times, but changed his mind when he heardnoises, such as the air conditioning system and nearby trains, orsaw shadows flickering on the walls.   Negotiators spoke with Firth on a police radio that he hadobtained from a jailer in the courtroom.   About 40 courthouse employees, including two judges, theirfamilies and news reporters huddled around police scanners in adarkened parking lot across the street from the courthouse as thedrama unfolded.   Police shut off the street lights and cordoned off the buildingfor a block on all sides in the belief that Firth may have wiredthe top floor of the courthouse with explosives.   When Firth decided to free Bailey just before 2 a.m., he couldbe heard on the police radio saying, ``There's a charge in one ofthese filing cabinets in front of the door ... and something insideit fell. If these wires aren't touching, I'm in trouble.''   Firth, an auto mechanic, was released from prison in Octoberafter serving time on a rape conviction.   He was arrested March 8 and charged with first-degree sexualassault and kidnapping in the Feb. 24 attack on a grocery storeemployee.   In 1981, when he was a soldier stationed at Fort Carson inColorado Springs, Firth was sentenced to serve eight years on arape conviction, Department of Corrections officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
