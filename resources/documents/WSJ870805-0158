Nevertheless it should be noted that there are some organizations that do not indulge in self-enrichment and are wise stewards of the resources passing through their hands.    Educational Assistance Ltd. (EAL) barters corporate donations of excess goods and services to colleges in exchange for tuition scholarships for needy students. There is no charge to the student and no charge to the participating corporation. The shipping costs are donated by Allied Van Lines, a national moving company, and the colleges are charged a nominal handling fee. EAL does not pay my salary as president. Rather, as an employee of the Oil-Dri Corp. of America, I have been placed on special assignment with EAL.    Both the board of directors and the national advisory committee are completely voluntary and independent, and we are audited annually by Arthur Young andamp; Co. We do not participate in &quot;product dumping&quot;; rather, we make a conscious effort to only accept material that can be used on a college campus and that will generate scholarships for underprivileged youths.    With our small full-time staff and several volunteers, we have helped generate over $2 million in tuition scholarships and directly influenced the lives of over 400 needy, young people since we became operational in 1983.    V.R. Roskam   EAL President   Chicago   ---   Your article failed to draw a contrast between the family-controlled brokerage firm and bonafide nonprofit charities who, like Second Harvest, fill a unique role in distributing urgently needed products to millions of Americans. In describing Second Harvest as a &quot;nonprofit brokerage firm,&quot; you miss the focus of our work as a true charity.    Second Harvest is the nation's only national network of food banks, whose mission is to feed the hungry by soliciting and judiciously distributing wholesome and nutritious surplus food from processors and retailers. In 1986, our network of 200 food banks distributed 352 million pounds of food -- valued at over $500 million -- to 38,000 charities and social-service agencies nationwide. All of this was accomplished with a ratio of $162 worth of food for every $1 expended by Second Harvest.    Policies are formed and implemented by a national board consisting of 24 outside directors, including top executives from the food industry, food bankers and representatives of public-interest groups. We do not charge for distribution or receive any commissions, and we maintain detailed records of donor contributions through a computerized tracking system.    Philip R. Warth Jr.   President and Chief Executive Officer    Second Harvest   Chicago   ---   Product donations are an extremely effective way to both increase giving and expand human services to those who are less fortunate. Businesses who donate quality products usable in the voluntary sector should be congratulated. As its volunteer chairman, I am pleased to report that Gifts in Kind Inc. has coordinated over $100 million of new, high-quality products to over 40,000 charities nationwide. Our standards ensure that products are of the highest value and are delivered only to those who meet all recognized charitable organization standards.    William M. Ellinghaus   Retired President, ATandamp;T   New York</TEXT></DOC>
