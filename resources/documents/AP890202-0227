(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two explosions caused by runaway railroadcars rocked Montana's capital city Thursday, cutting off electricityand forcing the evacuation of thousands as wind chills dipped to 70degrees below zero.   The runaway cars derailed and hit a propane tank near therailroad tracks, setting off an explosion. Minutes later, the firefrom the blast caused one of the derailed cars containing a highlyflammable chemical to blow up, authorities said. A second carcontaining plastic also burned, producing a cloud of black smokethat prompted the evacuations.   The force of the 4:48 a.m. blasts overturned automobiles,shattered windows up to two miles away, damaged a nearby college andhomes, and hurled pieces of railroad cars through buildings aquarter-mile away. But only two minor injuries were reported.   ``It's a miracle no one was killed or injured,'' said Ed Schild,Lewis and Clark County undersheriff.   Mayor Russell Ritter estimated the damage at $3 million.   The accident happened as a severe cold snap paralyzed the state.Gov. Stan Stephens shut down state government throughout Montana,citing the bitter-cold temperatures, power outages and fumes emittedby the fire.   Authorities originally believed that a railroad car containingpolyvinyl chloride was on fire. PVC produces dangerous hydrogenchloride gas when ignited, and the belief prompted the evacuationsand orders to stay indoors.   But authorities later discovered that the hopper car, though itcarried a sign indicating PVC was aboard, actually containedgranular polyethylene, and that the smoke billowing over the valleywas carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.   ``It dissipates in the atmosphere and is not serious,'' said PaulSpengler, the county disaster coordinator.   But the fire proved stubborn, and the blaze was still smolderingThursday night despite firefighting efforts.   Fire officials feared the blaze could ignite a nearby tank carthat contained hydrogen peroxide, the chemical that exploded, butthey believed that a layer of ice that encased the car would lessenthe threat, Spengler said.   The explosions occurred in an open area on the city's west sideand severed one of three major power lines, authorities said.Although power initially was knocked out for 37,000 people in andaround Helena, electricity was restored to most areas by 11 a.m.   Authorities evacuated about 2,000 people from an area one squaremile around the burning railroad car, said City Manager BillVerwolf. Residents were allowed to return starting late afternoon,when the fire was under control, he said.   In Washington, the Federal Railroad Administration said the chainof events began when a cab heater malfunctioned in a Montana RailLink locomotive hauling 48 freight cars over the Continental Dividewest of Helena.   ``The crew stopped the freight to exchange the lead locomotivefor another lead locomotive with a better heater ...,'' the FRA saidin a statement. ``This manuever required them to disconnect thelocomotives from the 48 freight cars being hauled.   ``When the exchange of locomotives was complete, the crewreturned to pick up the freight cars only to find they were gone,''it said, adding that the cars had rolled 12 miles east to Helena.   The FRA said the runaway cars hit another locomotive and 21 ofthe cars derailed. One of those cars hit a propane tank alongsidethe track, the agency said, touching off an explosion.   ``The ensuing fire triggered a second explosion in one of thehazardous material cars,'' the FRA said   ``I jumped out of the way from being squashed,'' said MikeMcNellis, who was aboard the locomotive that was struck as it wasswitching to another track.   One paramedic was taken to a hospital after inhaling fumes.Firefighters wore respirators as they poured water on the flames.   Evacuees fled to churches, the Helena Civic Center, the NationalGuard armory and schools, which were already closed by the severecold. Temperatures hovered near 30 degrees below zero, whichcombined with winds to produce wind chills of 70 degrees below zero,the National Weather Service said. Snow fell intermittently.   ``The weather couldn't be worse,'' said Ritter. ``Displacingpeople in these circumstances is tragic, but Helenans are toughpeople. We'll adjust.''   The collision occurred in an open area between the city dump andgolf course, about a quarter-mile north of Carroll College.   ``If it wasn't for that golf course and the (adjacent) baseballdiamonds, we'd have a lot of tragedies,'' said Lewis and ClarkCounty Sheriff Chuck O'Reilly.   Nearly all windows were shattered at Carroll College buildings,the school's physical education center had portions of its roofblown out, and pieces of railroad car dotted a snow-covered fieldnear a dormitory a quarter-mile away. A 1,500-pound railroad couplerfell through the roof of a dormitory, but no one was injured,authorities said.   ``Our campus has suffered extensive damage,'' said Ritter, who isalso head of development for Carroll.   Bruce Stewart, a Helena airport policeman helping with securityat the blast site, said a set of railroad car axles and wheels wentthrough the roof of a home near the college, but no one was injured.   Jeff Meyer said two windows were blown out of his house, about athird of a mile from the blast.   ``The explosion shook the whole house,'' he said. ``I saw theflash of light between our venetian blinds. I was thinking, `WorldWar III or something.'''</TEXT></DOC>
