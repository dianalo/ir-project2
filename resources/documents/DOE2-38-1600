<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-38-1600 </DOCNO><TEXT>Conceptual design of the Compact Ignition Tokamak (CIT) is near completion.This short-pulse ignition experiment is planned to follow the operationsof the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR) at the Princeton Plasma PhysicsLaboratory. The high neutron wall loadings, {approximately}4-5 MW/m{sup2}, associated with the operation of this device require that neutronics-relatedissues be considered in the overall system design. Radiation shieldingis required for the protection of device components and personnel. Aclose-in igloo shield has been designed around the periphery of the tokamakstructure, and the entire experiment is housed in a circular test cellfacility with a radius of {approximately}12 m. The most critical radiationconcern in the CIT design process relates to the numerous penetrationsin the device. This paper discusses the impact of a major penetrationon the design and operations of the CIT pellet injection system. Thepellet injector is a major component, which has a line-of-sight penetrationthrough the igloo and test cell wall. All current options for maintenanceof the injector require personnel access. A nuclear analysis has beenperformed to determine the feasibility of hands-on access. Results indicatethat personnel access to the pellet injector glovebox is possible. 10refs., 3 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
