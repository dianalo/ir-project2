Spd is taken up rapidly at a rate sustained throughout the cultureperiod. Considerable binding of Spd to TCA - precipitable material occursby day 2 of culture; it increases to a maximum on day 4 and declinesby day 10, shortly before flowering. About 80% of the TCA - precipitablelabel remains in the form of Spd, 12% shows up as putrescine and 3% asspermine. Differential centrifugation revealed binding of Spd to variouscell organelles. DNase, RNase and proteases were used to liberate Spdfrom the bound form. In nuclei it appears that 60% of the label is associatedwith nucleic acids and 40% with the protein fraction. In view of evidencefrom animals indicating Spd binding to specific proteins during organogenesis,they are investigating the nature of the Spd binding protein(s).</TEXT></DOC>
