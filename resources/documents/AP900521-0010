His army has suffered battlefield setbacks in recent months,particularly in the northernmost province of Eritrea, where rebelsappear on the verge of winning a 29-year-old war for independence.   Another insurgent group swept out of its stronghold in TigreProvince, just south of Eritrea, 10 months ago and has pressed itsfight to overthrow Mengistu's government to within 50 miles of thecapital.   The Soviet Union, preoccupied with its own economic andpolitical problems, has threatened to close the tap that has pouredbillions of dollars worth of military hardware into Ethiopia since1977.   Mengistu spurned the United States and its Western allies whenhe achieved power 13 years ago, and they are in no hurry to improverelations.   Major elements of Mengistu's own army attempted a coup lastyear. He said in a recent speech he had survived nine assassinationattempts.   With all those problems, and burdened by a collapsing economythat has never been robust, Mengistu signaled a change of coursetwo months ago. From now on, Ethiopia will favor free-marketeconomics and welcome foreign investment, he said.   Giant posters of Marx and Lenin came down in Addis Ababa, butthose showing Mengistu in various poses as a revered leader remain.   ``It looks like a deathbed conversion,'' a Western diplomat inAddis Ababa said, on condition of anonymity. ``If you believe thatMengistu has had a true change of heart, you probably also believein the Easter bunny.''   Mengistu joined other army officers in 1974, when he was amajor, in overthrowing Emperor Haile Selassie. Three years later,he reigned supreme.   He created the Marxist-Leninist Workers Party of Ethiopia in1984. In 1987, Mengistu established the People's DemocraticRepublic of Ethiopia, formally dropping his military rank oflieutenant colonel to become a civilian president.   Ethiopia is ruled by a small group agreeable to Mengistu's everyplan, according to the memoirs of Dawit Wolde Giorgis, a formermember of the party Central Committee who defected to the West.   Dawit, major human rights groups and other critics accuseMengistu of ordering or participating in the executions of dozensof rivals and of imprisoning thousands. Mengistu has denied theclaims.</TEXT></DOC>
