Of a dozen North American reindeer released last spring inBaxter State Park, only Daisy is known to be alive, although asecond caribou that lost its radio collar may also be, said RichardB. Anderson, project coordinator.   Five caribou died after being attacked by bears, and five diedof the ``brainworm'' parasite. Others still being kept in pens havebeen ravaged by brainworm and ulcers, said Anderson. More than twodozen caribou that were used as a breeding herd remain in pens atthe University of Maine at Orono.   Despite the troubles encountered by most of the herd, Daisy'sexperience ``shows they can thrive'' in Maine, where caribou werehunted out of the state around the turn of the century, McColloughsaid. Sightings and radio tracking mark a trek from the wildernesspark in central Maine to Quebec and back.   Daisy ``encountered everything possible,'' said Anderson. Itcrossed highways, stayed healthy, undoubtedly survived meetingbears and coyotes, ``and when we caught it, was in just as goodshape as when we let it go.''   Two dozen caribou were shot with tranquilizer darts inNewfoundland three years ago, rounded up on helicopters and trucked1,200 miles to Maine. Project leaders now have asked Canada for 25more caribou in 1990 and _ if all goes well _ for another 25 in1991 and in 1992.   Newfoundland's environmental and lands minister, Jim Kelland,agreed Wednesday to give the project up to 75 caribou. ``It'ssomething when you can share a bountiful resource that you havewith some other area that has been deprived for one reason oranother,'' he said.   ``This is a great Christmas present to all the people in theUnited States who believe that it's important to make a commitmentto restore native wildlife species,'' said Anderson, a former Maineconservation commissioner.   The Maine Caribou Project wants to release about 50 caribou _including most of those in the pens and those shipped from Canada _next year.   It would be the third release attempt. In 1963, two dozenNewfoundland caribou were released in Baxter, but they disappeared,possibly as a result of poaching, disease, predation and dispersal.Poaching is no longer considered a major threat, thanks to stiffnew fines and jail terms for killing a caribou.   Biologists have learned a lot from the setbacks of the latestattempt, Anderson said. For example, they learned that shots aremore effective against brainworm than putting medication in thecaribous' food. They also learned that bears are more likely toattack caribou than had been thought, and that bears tend to attacktheir prey's face, while coyotes attack the hindquarters.   Another lesson is that the caribou should not be kept in pensbefore being released because they do not learn to defendthemselves. And it appears caribou are more prone to brainwormwhile in captivity, McCollough said.   If caribou are released again, it will probably be in higherelevations, where they are less likely to come in contact with deerinfected by brainworm and they may fare better against predators,he said.   Biologists are even rethinking the way they should capture thecaribou. Some animals died as a result of a tranquilizing drug thathad varying results on different animals shot with darts during theDecember 1986 roundup.   While they are using a new drug, Newfoundland wildlife officialsare also experimenting with a roundup method used by Scandanaviansin herding reindeer _ driving caribou into a large, funnel-shapedcorral. Another possible plan is to drive them into a lake andcatch them while they are swimming.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon PMs, Dec. 18</NOTE></DOC>
