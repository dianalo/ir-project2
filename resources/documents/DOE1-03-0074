Exposure to salt ofaseptically grown, two-week old seedlings, was carried out in one oftwo ways: (1) a one step transfer of seedlings from medium without saltto that with the indicated concentrations followed by 5 hr or 24 hr incubationperiods. During the last 2 hrs of each incubation period the seedlingswere pulse-labelled with {sup 35}S Sulfate or L-Methionine; (2) a gradualincrease of the salt concentration at 50 mM increments at 2-4 day intervals.Two days after reaching the desired salt concentration, the seedlingswere pulse-labelled for 2 hrs with {sup 35}S sulfate or L-methionine.Protein from roots were extracted and analyzed. Polypeptides were visualizedby staining with coomassie blue or by fluorography. Qualitative as wellas quantitative changes of gene expression as induced by salt could beobserved. Their significance regarding salt tolerance will be discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
