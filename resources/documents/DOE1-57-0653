Since its introduction into the clinicalenvironment in the early 1980's, this technology has had a major impacton the practice of neurology. It has proved to be superior to computedtomography for imaging many diseases of the brain and spine. In someinstances it has clearly replaced computed tomography. It is likely thatit will replace myelography for the assessment of cervicomedullary junctionand spinal regions. The magnetic field strengths currently used appearto be entirely safe for clinical application in neurology except in patientswith cardiac pacemakers or vascular metallic clips. Some shortcomingsof magnetic resonance imaging include its expense, the time requiredfor scanning, and poor visualization of cortical bone.</TEXT></DOC>
