The businesses on the block represent about $2.2 billion,or about 40%, of the financial assets of Xerox Credit Corp.,Xerox's financing subsidiary. They also include $140 millionin assets in international third-party financing but don'taffect the financing of Xerox equipment or any other Xeroxfinance-oriented businesses.</LP><TEXT>   Alex Henderson, analyst at Prudential-Bache SecuritiesInc., valued the businesses for sale at between $150 millionand $300 million. Xerox couldn't be reached for comment onits target price.   Yesterday's announcement comes amid Xerox's recentdisillusionment with its financial-services business, whichwas responsible for a $375 million first-quarter write-offrelated to bad real-estate investments.   Wall Street analysts have tied that change in corporateattitude to the appointment of Paul Allaire, head of thecompany's business-equipment arm, as successor to DavidKearns as chief executive.   Mr. Allaire is known as a cost-cutter, and analysts say hehas sent out word that unprofitable businesses, especially inthe financial-services sector, must shape up or be sold.   But yesterday's announcement also coincided withspeculation about another impending write-off, related toXerox's Crum andamp; Forster insurance unit. That speculation,featured in an article in yesterday's Wall Street Journal,sent Xerox shares diving $1.75 a share to close at $46.50 incomposite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.   &quot;The timing obviously isn't an accident,&quot; said Mr.Henderson. &quot;The specter of some fairly significant write-offsscared a lot of people, but this should compensate and putthe stock back on track.&quot;   The announcement was made after the market closedyesterday. Mr. Henderson said he expects Xerox shares torebound to previous levels on the news today. &quot;The Streetwill laud any move to sell anything in financial services,&quot;he said. &quot;Anything that takes debt and liability off thebalance sheet will be viewed positively.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
