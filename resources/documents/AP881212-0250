ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   As the 1988 political year began, theconventional wisdom was that Ronald Reagan's retirement would mean aclose race for the White House, and George Bush, hisloyal-to-a-fault vice president, had little chance to succeed him.   Now, at the end of a long campaign road strewn with the wreckageof such assumptions, Bush is forming his administration and DemocratMichael Dukakis is back at his old stand as governor ofMassachusetts.   Democrats are taking comfort in their gains in other races.Despite Bush's 40-state victory Nov. 8, the Democrats added to theircongressional majorities, picking up one Senate seat and three inthe House.   With one more Democratic governor, the party now has 28, to 22for the Republicans.   But after losing their fifth presidential election out of thelast six, the Democrats were wondering when they would ever regaincontrol of the White House.   For the voters, Election Day brought a welcome end to a campaignthat often was more slime than substance.   Convicted rapist Willie Horton gained celebrity status and a deadfish floating among the Boston Harbor debris became a familiartelevision image.   Dukakis was another ``liberal governor coming out of nowhere''who had vetoed legislation to require the Pledge of Allegiance inMassachusetts schools and who was a ``card-carrying member of theACLU.''   Republicans were portrayed as ``popping champagne corks in theirpenthouses.'' And their nominee? ``George Bush is a man who was bornon third base and thinks that he's hit a triple,'' was one of thebiggest applause lines at the Democratic National Convention.   Was Bush a wimp? Was Dukakis too cold?   Such matters overshadowed concerns about the budget and tradedeficits, education, drugs, and defense and foreign policy.   The election year opened with high hopes for the Democrats. Thepopular Reagan, after all, would not be on the ballot.   The Democrats had regained control of the Senate in 1986, manypolls reported Americans wanted a change in political leadershipafter seven years of a Republican White House, and everywhere Bushwent he was dogged by questions about his role in the Iran-Contraaffair. What did the vice president know and what advice had hegiven the president?   ``I've answered the questions and I've cooperated fully with anyinvestigations, none of which, by the way, were aimed at me,'' heresponded, refusing to discuss what he had told Reagan.   Large fields were running hard in both parties at the start ofthe election year _ eight Democrats and six Republicans.   The Democratic contenders, along with Dukakis, were Sens. JosephBiden of Delaware, Paul Simon of Illinois and Albert Gore Jr. ofTennessee; Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri; Jesse Jackson; formerGov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona and former Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado.   On the Republican side, Bush was regarded as a shaky front-runnerwith Senate GOP leader Bob Dole of Kansas and Rep. Jack Kemp of NewYork given strong chances of brushing the vice president out of therace. The other contenders were former Secretary of State AlexanderM. Haig Jr., former Gov. Pete du Pont of Delaware and televisionevangelist Pat Robertson.   Bush was written off after finishing third to Dole and Robertsonin Iowa.   ``The hemorrhaging of George Bush has begun,'' said Haig.   But New Hampshire Republicans stopped that hemorrhaging and putBush back on track to the nomination.   Displaying an uncanny consistency, Iowa voters also gave Dukakisa third-place finish and he, too, won in New Hampshire.   The two big winners in Super Tuesday's combination of primarieswere liberals Jackson and Dukakis. Gore did well in the Southernprimaries, but he had to split votes there with Jackson and hadlittle support north of the Mason-Dixon Line.   On the Republican side, Bush swept all 16 primaries on the bigday.   That effectively locked up the nomination for Bush. But Dukakisstill had a tough road ahead.   He finished third in Illinois behind favorite sons Simon andJackson, and then was upset by Jackson in Michigan. But when therace came down to Dukakis against Jackson, the Massachusettsgovernor ran off a string of victories that clinched the nomination.   The Democrats roasted Bush at their convention, put on aclosing-night unity show and saw their nominee jump to double-digitleads in the national polls.   Enter Willie Horton. In television commercials and countlessspeeches, the Bush campaign raised the case of the Massachusettsconvict who, while free on a furlough from prison, raped a Marylandwoman.   The Republicans also attacked the Democratic nominee for vetoingthe Pledge of Allegiance bill and for Boston Harbor's pollution.   For weeks, Dukakis ignored the attacks. But his big lead in thepolls was dwindling and by Labor Day it was gone. By the time heresponded, it was too late. The big lead had swung to Bush.   Bush built his lead despite what was widely regarded as a majorpolitical mistake _ his selection of Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana ashis running mate.   National polls consistently reported voters, by a wide margin,preferred Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen ofTexas over Quayle.   But on Nov. 8 voters focused on the presidential nominees.Despite Bentsen's presence on the ticket, Bush carried Texas.   ``I think one of the lessons of the campaign is that you have torespond and you have to respond quickly,'' Dukakis said at apost-election news conference.   It was one of the kinder assessments of his effort, which manyother Democrats called ``the worst campaign of this century.''   But the 1988 votes were no sooner counted than Democrats beganlooking to 1992, when some old names _ Jackson, Gephardt and Gore _may contend with some new _ Sens. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, SamNunn of Georgia and the newly elected Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, andNew York Gov. Mario Cuomo _ for the Democratic nomination.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Year-End Editions</NOTE></DOC>
