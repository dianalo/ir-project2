 World War III has started, the battle lines have beendrawn, and you're in command of the U.S.andP;  Army's deadliest tank.andP;  This is thehigh-tension backdrop for Abrams Battle Tank, another addictive masterpiecefrom Electronic Arts.andM;Abrams Battle Tank consists of eight scenarios that you can play individuallyor as part of a campaign.andP;  Individual scenarios provide the opportunity topractice your skills, since you control the level of difficulty.andP;  Scenarioshave no time limit, but there is also no way to save a battle in progress.andM;Before each mission, the life-like Colonel Wilson briefs you on your specificgoal and gives you reconnaissance reports.andP;  Next stop is the motor pool,where you select varying combinations of weapons to defend against specificthreats.andP;  If your tank sustains damage in combat or you run out ofammunition, you can try to return to base and refurbish your supplies.andM;A typical mission sends you deep behind enemy lines, where you must seek anddestroy an enemy base or rescue a group of stranded tanks and guide them backto safety.andM;Sometimes your goal is chillingly simple: survival.andP;  And even that is noteasy.andP;  Behind any hill or on any ridge there could be a slew of troublewaiting for you--anthing from helicopters to infantry armed with antitankmissiles.andM;If you choose to play a full campaign, you must complete all eight missions,with all the settings selected by chance.andP;  Here again, you cannot save aparticular battle until you've completed it.andP;  However, I did find that Icould just turn off the computer if I needed to leave midbattle.andP;  Thisnullifies the current battle, though, and you must repeat it later tocomplete the campaign.andM;You control the tank from four locations: the gunner's station, the tankcommander's station, the cupola, and the driver's station.andM;From the command post, you can pan the horizon 360 degrees to keep a watchfuleye on hostile forces, and check your position on your MSP as you move acrossthe multiterrained battlefield.andP;  You also have ready access to the tank'svital statistics: fuel level, engine temperature and, most important, damage.andM;If there is beauty in war, however, you will find it in the gunner's station,where your highly sophisticated thermal sighting and laser guidance systemmake blowing away the commie aggressors as easy as target practice.andM;You press a button and the guidance system locks onto the most immediatetarget, identifies it, and tells you the range and your chance of hitting it.andO;Press another button and watch your target collapse into rubble.andM;If you are skilled and lucky enough to complete a campaign, you receive afinal military ranking and a newspaper report describing the outcome of thewar.andM;What makes this game so appealing is its colorful realism.andP;  The tank movesand fires in real time.andP;  It jostless when you speed up, stop, enter, or leavethe road, or--heaven help you--get hit by an enemy shell.andP;  And yourthree-dimensional outer world is just as flush with details.andP;  Hills,mountains, streams, bridges, and farms await your every turn, not to mentionhostile Soviet forces.andM;As with many modern games, you need at least a 286 processor and EGA graphicsto effectively play Abrams Battle Tank.andP;  I tried playing on an IBM XT, but itwas far too slow.andP;  And with CGA graphics, enemy tanks are just too difficultto see.andP;  In EGA resolution, the world is real.andP;  Play this game on a 386 withVGA and you'll feel like you're really there.andM;The succinct manual offers excellent help for getting started quickly.andP;  Andunlike many simulators, Abrams Battle Tank is easy to learn.andP;  After two orthree scenarios, you should be a proficient commander.andM;The downsides are few.andP;  Battle Tank lacks the incredible level of detail thatMicroprose crams into M1 Tank Platoon, and its modest manual doesn't begin tocompete with the tome that Microprose gives you.andP;  I'd like to be able to savea scenario in midbattle, and I wish that individual missions differed interrain and enemy placements each time you played them.andM;I also wish the other U.S.andP;  tanks could take a more active part in thebattles, rather than blindly roaming the battlefields while Soviet crews ripholes in the sides of your tank.andP;  Here again, Microprose gets points forallowing you to control any of the individual tanks in a platoon instead ofjust one tank.andM;List Price: Abrams Battle Tank, $39.95.andP;  Requires: 512K RAM, graphicsadapter, DOS 2.0 or later.andP;
