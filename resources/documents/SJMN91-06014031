The Associated Press obtained a copy of the memorandum.;    EPAofficials did not select any of the people Bromley proposed.;    Theresearchers on Bromley's list &quot;range from skeptics to vociferousdisbelievers,&quot; said David Savitz, an epidemiologist at the University of NorthCarolina in Chapel Hill who has studied the health risks of electromagneticfields.;    &quot;If they were picked exclusively, they would predictably  put lesscredence in the suggestions of adverse health effects  from electromagneticfields,&quot; Savitz said.;    Robert Adair of Yale University, one of Bromley'scandidates, agreed: &quot;I think there's no question they would say this is a poordocument.&quot;;    &quot;I find the EPA report an advocacy document, very poorscientifically,&quot; Adair said. &quot;I feel that anybody who thinks that was a gooddocument is a nitwit.&quot;;    The panel at the three-day meeting in Washingtonwill revise the report and produce a final version.;    The report, whichreviews existing studies, says studies  finding evidence that electromagneticfields cause cancer &quot;are biologically plausible.&quot; Studies of cancer inchildren &quot;have consistently found modestly elevated risks, some statisticallysignificant, of leukemia, cancer of the nervous system and, to a lesserextent, lymphomas,&quot; it concludes.;    The &quot;consistent pattern of response . .. suggests a causal link&quot; between magnetic fields and cancer, the reportsays.;    EPA officials emphasize, however, that the studies do not yet provethat electromagnetic fields -- which are produced by all electrical wiring andelectrical devices, including shavers, hair dryers and heaters -- causecancer.;    Savitz, who read an earlier draft of the report, said, &quot;I thoughtit was good. What they were concluding is what most people who read theliterature conclude: There is credible evidence of adverse health effects fromthese exposures. Credible does not mean conclusive. It means that it is notdismissible.&quot;;    Donald Barnes of the EPA's Scientific Advisory Board officesaid the agency did not select any of the people Bromley proposed because theyweren't considered objective.;    &quot;They were people who had basically taken apublic position&quot; that the fields posed no health risks, he said.;    SarahKeegan, a spokeswoman for Bromley, said he was unavailable for comment.;    Inthe end, the panel consisted of scientists representing a broad range ofscientific disciplines, including biology, physics and epidemiology. It alsoincluded some scientists aligned with the utility industry.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910114  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  474  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, January 14, 199100014031,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
