Testifying Friday in North's trial on charges stemming from theIran-Contra affair, McFarlane said he didn't know how his formeraide had become involved in private fund-raising for the Contras orwas determining how private contributions were being spent.   McFarlane also said he hadn't known that North had used a publicrelations consultant to get a quick $30,000 donation for the Contras.   Earlier, McFarlane said former President Reagan knew in 1984 thatarrangements had been made to get $1 million a month from SaudiArabia for the the U.S.-backed rebels in Nicaragua.   And Reagan said ``we'll all be hanging by our thumbs'' if wordgot out that McFarlane or other administration officials wereseeking help from abroad at a time that Congress had forbiddendirect U.S. aid to the Contras, according to minutes of the 1984meeting read into the court record.   Despite a series of memos from North to McFarlane betweenDecember 1984 and May 1985, McFarlane said he didn't know specificsof North's activities such as his help in directing the Contras inopening of another front in Nicaragua.   ``I had been in the military for 20 years and I knew theactivities of a single officer in setting up a Southern Front wasinconsequential,'' said McFarlane, like North a former Marine. ``Itdidn't occur to me that North ... could set up a Southern Front.''   In the late summer and fall of 1985, two congressional panelsbegan asking about news reports of North's involvement with theContras. Four of North's 12 criminal charges say he preparedresponses for McFarlane's signature essentially denying that Northwas doing anything for the guerrilla force.   McFarlane has pleaded guilty to four charges of withholdinginformation from Congress and was sentenced last week to two years'probation, 200 hours of community service and fines of $20,000.   A March 5, 1985, memo from North to McFarlane says Guatemalashould get extra U.S. aid because Guatemalan officials suppliedphony certificates that permitted a clandestine arms shipment to goto the Contras.   ``I didn't even look at the certificates at the time,'' saidMcFarlane, saying they were ``one of 10,000 documents'' that crossedhis desk.   McFarlane said that ``there was a relation'' between thecertificates and the suggestion for additional aid, although theextra aid ``stood on the merits.'' But the ``fact they helped thefreedom fighters certainly didn't disqualify them'' from gettingadditional assistance, McFarlane said.   The request for extra aid went to top Cabinet officials and thechairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff without mentioning that phonyend-user certificates had been provided.   The end-user certificates state that a country, such asGuatemala, is the ultimate destination of arms.   A March 16, 1985, memo suggests having a tax-exempt charitableorganization collect private donations that would be used to aid theContras, a move that would be illegal.   McFarlane acknowledged that a tax-exempt organization cannotraise money for military items for use in a foreign country, butsaid that even ``the president suggested that a time or two.''   In response to a Dec. 4, 1984, memo from North, McFarlane refusedto authorize having the U.S. government let the government of Taiwanknow that the United States supported that nation making acontribution to the Contras.   ``I thought the problem ... was our seeking military help fromanother country,'' McFarlane testified.   North is accused of lying during congressional and presidentialinquiries into the Iran-Contra affair.</TEXT></DOC>
