Manuel Noriega if he resigns and leaves Panama.    Administration officials emphasized last night that agreement hadn't been reached on the latest offer, and that negotiations were continuing in Panama. U.S. attempts to force Gen. Noriega from power have failed in the past, in part because of the Panamanian strong man's intransigence and in part because of disagreements within the administration over how to oust him.    U.S. officials said yesterday, after a high-level White House meeting, that the latest offer calls on Gen. Noriega to relinquish power and leave Panama by Aug. 12, the fifth anniversary of his taking charge of the Panamanian military. It also calls on him to stay out of the country until after elections slated for 1990.    In addition, the proposal calls for Panama to pass a law limiting to five years the term of Gen. Noriega's successor as head of the Panamanian Defense Forces. It's expected that if an agreement is reached on the proposal, the U.S. would quickly drop economic sanctions imposed on Panama last month.    U.S. attorneys in Tampa and Miami, where the indictments against Gen. Noriega are pending, have strongly resisted dropping the criminal charges, according to law enforcement officials. In the past, top aides to Attorney General Edwin Meese also argued against dropping the indictments.    Senior administration officials refused to comment last night on the latest proposal. Some expressed concern that, as in the past, a disclosure of the offer could scuttle the current round of negotiations.    The Reagan administration has softened its positions frequently in its campaign to oust Gen. Noriega. At one point, it indicated it wouldn't seek his extradition to stand trial in the U.S. on the drug charges if he agreed to go into exile.    Last month, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater announced, in an about-face, that the administration was more concerned with getting Gen. Noriega out of power than forcing him to leave Panama. A day earlier, a State Department negotiator had been in Panama pushing hard for both the general's resignation and departure.    Dropping criminal charges against Gen. Noriega could produce political problems for Vice President George Bush's presidential effort because such a move would run counter to the administration's strong anti-drug posture. </TEXT></DOC>
