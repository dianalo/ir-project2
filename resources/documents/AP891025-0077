Despite the toll, some 75,000 football fans saw the SanFrancisco 49ers play in Stanford University stadium on Sunday,defeating the New England Patriots, and it was announced that theWorld Series between the San Francisco Giants and Oakland Athleticswould resume ... Friday.   Such events perhaps are part of the answer to a question whichmust be asked: Why will millions of people continue to live in aknown fault zone that promises even larger earthquakes with greaterdeath and destruction?   One obvious reason is that all of us place our lives andfortunes on the line every day. More than 50,000 persons die eachyear in auto accidents alone.   Another part of the answer lies with the unquenchable part ofthe human spirit that has always defied threats to life andeconomic stability.   But together, are these reasons the full answer to the questionof why virtually all of those in the San Francisco area are nowbeginning to rebuild their lives and stake out new futures? No,they are not.   A certain state of mind exists in California in general and SanFrancisco in particular. A youthful exhilaration exists there thatcomes from the outdoor lifestyle of swimming, surfing and skiingand being on the cutting edge of much change in American society.   For millions, the risk of life in that region is worth it.</TEXT><TEXT>   Oct. 22,   Aberdeen (S.D.) American News on the earthquake and compassion:   Last Wednesday (Oct. 18), the switchboard at KYW-TV inPhiladelphia logged nearly 500 angry calls between 8:30 a.m. andnoon.   They came in response to NBC's coverage of the Californiaearthquake that expanded the ``Today'' show and cut the regularmorning lineup.   The quake put the Bay Bridge World Series on hold. The nextmorning sportscasters, with a token nod to the tragedy of death anddevastated lives in California, clamored to know when the serieswould resume.   Incredible. That within hours attention could so easily turnfrom real-life battles for survival to the contrived struggle of agame.   Disquieting that viewers would respond so angrily at beingdenied an hour of watching actors mimic tragedy.   Distressing that even a few Americans were unwilling to pause _and to make the adjustments in their daily lives that comprisecompassion.</TEXT><TEXT>   Oct. 24   Charleston (W.Va.) Daily Mail on the earthquake and baseball:   Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent deserves special praise forhis actions since the Oct. 17 earthquake. His decision to delay theWorld Series reveals a solid set of priorities.   Candlestick Park probably could have withstood an earlyresumption of the series. Bay area residents certainly could use adiversion from the task of cleaning up.   But resuming play wasn't worth the extra burden the game wouldplace on the area's already overtaxed highway and public safetysystems. Having the games on weekday afternoons to meet the EastCoast's prime-time schedule would push more traffic onto SanFrancisco's weakened transportation system at rush hour.   Given how much overemphasis is placed on sports in America,Vincent's willingness to postpone the Series is heartening.Baseball, after all, is what you're supposed to do after the realwork is done.</TEXT><TEXT>   Oct. 23   Las Cruces (N.M.) Sun-News on flag burning:   It's probably a good thing the U.S. Senate killed a proposedconstitutional amendment against burning or otherwise desecratingthe American flag. The Bill of Rights has stood us in good steadfor two centuries now, and it isn't wise to tinker with it.   The issue was understandably emotion-charged. The senatorsunderstood very well that their constituents love the flag and wantit protected. Probably some of them voted for the amendment thoughthey privately deemed it unwise, and were sure it would bedefeated, in order to appear to be on the side of the angels.   But a number of influential voices, including those of severalleading conservatives, had been raised against the amendment. Thegist of what they had to say was that flag burning does not poseany such threat to the public order as to justify altering outbasic guarantees of liberty and due process.</TEXT><TEXT>   Oct. 20   The Sheboygan (Wis.) Press on flag burning:   A little flag-waving is in order for the U.S. Senate's defeat ofa proposed constitutional amendment to ban burning or desecratingOld Glory.   The boiling cauldron of emotions over flag burning this pastsummer has been reduced to a low simmer, and the Senate has finallyput the issue to rest, as it should have.   Meddling with the U.S. Constitution is unnecessary. Besides, aflag-burning amendment would have weakened the very freedoms thatthe flag represents.   Hurray for the Senate, and for the red, white and blue.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
