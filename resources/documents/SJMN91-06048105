We knew there would be sickness,mountains, deserts and foul weather. There were 3,000 miles in front of us.;   Granted, it was a minivan and a smooth highway. But Meriwether Lewis hadneither a perpetually nauseated pregnant wife nor a rambunctious 3-year-oldson as companions. So we left South Florida for the Bay Area with sometrepidation, wondering how our vacation would end.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Perspective  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  AN INSPIRING DRIVE FROM COAST TO COAST  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Mark Newman is a Mercury News staff writer.  </MEMO><TEXT>     By the fifth motel, the word &quot;inspiring&quot; had come often to mind. It was notso much the sight of Texas' longhorn steer, Arizona's painted landscape northe mountains by Mohave as it was the mere decor of the day. America wasdressed in red, white and blue, trimmed in yellow. The silent majority spoke.;   The occasion, of course, was an unfortunate one. Every city and every widespot in the road seemed to be affected by Operation Desert Storm -- anddetermined to show their collective support. If it could be reduced to asingle post card, it would be taped to the inside of every soldier's helmet.;   Some communities had a greater stake in the fighting than others, and someshowed their colors better than others. But a common thread ran through ascontinuously as the highway. After watching our flag being burned abroad, itwas dramatic and moving to see it fly with seemingly each mile marker.;    Theaverage diner marquee touted the troops or encouraged prayer for them. Therewere nearly as many renditions of the Star Spangled Banner on the localairwaves as I annually hear as a sportswriter. (The most common one was areplay of Whitney Houston's recent Super Bowl version). One out of 20vehicles, most of them interestingly concentrated in Navajo country, seemed tohave a yellow ribbon on its antenna. Many newspapers made literal use of theold journalistic term &quot;flag,&quot; printing Old Glory beside the name of thepublication. Many carried updates on local servicemen or women. War vigilswere fast becoming a trend and support groups were growing.;    As for thetitle of Most Patriotic Little Place In America, there was a tie betweenRobertsdale, Ala., and Ozona, Texas. It was an unscientific study to be sure,for we traversed only the Sun Belt and, given Karen's condition, tried not toveer too far from the beaten path. It was a fair barometer, though, tangibleproof that we are at war and that we are united states.;    The drive itselfwas a strong testament to the freedoms here. Try going from Al-Basrah toAl-Mawsil. Here there is a great sense of security, which has been due partlyto two oceans and largely to such folks as those fighting now. In thiscountry, we discovered, you can even pass through Bagdad and feel safe.;   That's Bagdad with no H. It is a Florida panhandle town, a stop on the firstday of our trek. It seems that media types often call there out of curiosity,and that they are informed that freedom rings as often as the phones. (Thebutcher of Bagdad actually works just down the road in Milton).;    It rainedin Bagdad, as it did for the first one-third of our drive. This was a smallproblem for us in that the water seeped into our overhead luggage shell andstained a good portion of our clothes. For the folks in Robertsdale, a3,000-strong agricultural town close to Mobile, the elements obviously did notmatter. For every 100 feet alongside the main drag through town, there was alarge flag. All 25 of them were soaked.;    That went against the time-honoredguidelines of flag-waving, but no one seemed to mind.;    &quot;We decided that theboys were out there in that kind of weather, so we were going to keep theflags out,&quot; said Marjorie Richards, the executive director of the Robertsdalechamber of commerce.;    Richards said she moved from Bakersfield toRobertsdale in 1983, and said the Alabama Gulf area &quot;is still one of hestrongholds of patriotism. It's Mom and apple pie. People really believe inour country. They live a quiet life. It's just a beautiful place to retireto.&quot;;    She said there was a &quot;silent march&quot; through town on Veterans Day,noting that five percent of the local residents are in the Persian Gulfcompared to the national average of one percent per community. Most of theones from Robertsdale, Richards said, had been in the National Guard. The townnow plans a candlelight drumbeat march to honor the troops.;    &quot;If you hadgone off the beaten path,&quot; she said, &quot;you would have found the other littletowns are flying flags as well.&quot;;    Flags, flags. In Pensacola, Fla., a bigNavy town, a 45-foot flagpole has been installed at the Convention andVisitors Information Center so that Old Glory could go up and stay up untilthe fighting stops. In Biloxi, Miss., a deejay announced that 100 flags wouldbe given away at a coming event. At the Bank of Gonzalez (La.), an enormousflag draped from the top of the building is all the rage.;    In New Orleans,people were preparing for the Mardi Gras and a break from the constant warreports. Yet, even that event is touched. Organizers announced that thetraditional Mardi Gras colors of green and gold will give way to red, whiteand blue.;    Filling up the gas tank was another sure reminder. In the windowof one Interstate 10 station was a sign bearing 40 hearts, on each of whichwas written the name of a gulf participant, names drawn by local relatives orby those just passing through. At another station, O.D.S. caps and T-shirtsabounded.;    Gas prices themselves were of interest. On the average, theywere about 20 cents cheaper than when we had begun our vacation in the days ofDesert Shield. The cheapest gas was in Bakersfield -- $1.03 a gallon forregular unleaded. The most expensive was in the really isolated places, whereit was going for as much as $1.40.;    That happened to be the going rate inOzona. And they are used to it. It is a town of about 3,600 people, the solecity in a 3,000-square-mile chunk of Texas called Crockett County. It liesbetween San Antonio and El Paso on I-10, a ranching town that named its countyafter and build a monument for someone who had no local ties but simplyembodied patriotism during the siege of the Alamo.;    That patriotismprevails today. Atop the Jan. 30 front page of the Ozona Stockman, and beneaththe flag-flag, was a proclamation by County Judge Kathryn Mayfield that thefollowing Monday would be a &quot;Day of Support and Patriotism.&quot; Nancy Moore, acoordinator for the Ozona chamber of commerce, said later that up to 1,000people showed up for a rally on that day. A letter from President Bush wasread to them, its sentiment echoing: &quot;We will prevail. Our reward will be thedawning of a new world order.&quot; The high-school band played. People signedletters to send to the local troops abroad.;    &quot;It's what Davy Crockett stoodfor,&quot; Moore said. &quot;We have our support group that is making the patrioticlapel pins. We gave out 400 at the rally and we just sent to town to give out400 more. We sold five-dozen flags for 75 cents and we ran out of those within20 minutes.&quot;;    In Flagstaff, Ariz., George Case and Paul Ruiz were paradingaround town in a pickup truck that hauls a replica Patriot missile. They builtit from specifications they saw on TV, and adorned it with a large Husseinmask. Meanwhile, the local Daily Sun prints a regular feature called &quot;Beaconsthrough the storm,&quot; an update on local O.D.S. participants as relayed byrelatives.;    Entering California on I-40, there were yellow ribbons on theInspection Station. An inspector said the state encouraged the display andthat her supervisor had a relative headed for Saudi Arabia. Just ahead inNeedles, residents were flocking to the Santa Fe Park, where ribbons werebeing tied on trees as part of a Saturday afternoon war vigil.;    It was moreof the same on into the Bay Area, where the almost forgotten voices of dissentonce again were heard. The geography had changed over 3,000 miles, but neverthe mood.;    The patriotic show was of no relief to Karen, whose sceneryconsisted mostly of Rest Areas. It was of no interest to Matt, who waged a3,000-mile duel between Donatello and Foot Soldier. I, however, know Jeffersonwould love the account.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MARK NEWMAN  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910217  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,472  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday February 17, 199100048105,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
