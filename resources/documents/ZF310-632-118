Kratzke, associate director of the AgricultureDepartment's Office of IRM.andM;Agency speakers at a FOSE '91 seminar in Washington on adaptive technologyfor people with special needs said compliance to the 1986 amendment to theRehabilitation Act, Section 508, is made more critical because of tightfunding for new hires.andM;Section 508 requires federal vendors to provide any adaptive devices neededby handicapped users.andP;  The law also requires development of a general federalpolicy and specific agency policies on meeting the needs of handicappedworkers.andM;&quot;We have to be hiring people and providing tools to meet their needs.andP;  Havingthe tools and not the people is not getting us anywhere,&quot; Kratzke said.andM;When Esther Georgatos, director of the Office of Customer Support at theVeterans Affairs Department, tried to hire staff for the VA InformationTechnology Center in 1984, all of the handicapped applicants for the job wereoverqualified for the positions.andP;  The center showcases technologies thatassist handicapped employees.andM;&quot;It became apparent to me that it was almost a national disgrace that we hadthis talent that was being warehoused,&quot; she said.andP;  VA is one of the largestemployers of handicapped people in the government and nationwide.andM;Many employers use the excuse that it costs too much to accommodatehandicapped employees, but the technological expense is no longer a barrier,she said.andM;&quot;The cost of technology is cheap and getting cheaper.andP;  The cost of people iswhat's expensive,&quot; she said.andM;An Even ChanceandM;When a new employee with disabilities comes to the Commerce Department, &quot;themechanism should be in place to provide a level playing field&quot; for thatemployee to work productively, said Edward Reed Jr., technical adviser toCommerce's Committee on Resources for Electronic Access Technology to EndUsers, or CREATE.andM;Providing accessibility equipment to disabled Commerce workers has increasedtheir productivity and made department managers aware of the benefits ofSection 508, Reed said.andM;&quot;But as we brought andlsqb;managersandrsqb; into the arena, they didn't all comewillingly,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;We wanted them to understand that accessibility in the1990s is not an option, it is mandated.&quot;andM;Before 1984, there was no government policy on accessibility, said Dan Maday,director of the Information, Technology and Resources Directorate of theGeneral Services Administration.andM;GSA lead by example.andP;  Judge Leonard J. Suchanek, the sight-impaired chairmanof the GSA Board of Contract Appeals, sparked interest in accessibility whenhe asked how a GSA computer system could serve him, Maday said.andP;  Suchanek hasbeen a leading advocate for handicapped federal employees.andM;Susan Brummel, director of GSA's Clearinghouse for Computer Accommodations,said the computer industry's initial reaction to providing accessibleequipment was indifference: &quot;We don't know that dance, and we don't want toplay that music.&quot;andM;But companies soon realized it made &quot;good business sense&quot; to provideequipment to a potential market of handicapped computer users, and in 1986&quot;the federal government was willing to take the lead and choreograph thedance&quot; through law, Brummel said.andM;Agriculture is doing a three-year, site-by-site survey of its 15,000 officesworldwide to find out employees' needs and priorities, Kratzke said.andM;The department is emphasizing training programs for its field office managerson hiring employees with disabilities, he said.andM;Accessibility has so evolved that reluctance by vendors or agencies toprovide it could cause them to lose a contract or jeopardize a delegation ofprocurement authority, Brummel said.andM;Maday said many people are looking at standards as the next hurdle foraccessible equipment.andP;  The National Institute of Standards and Technology isgoing to undertake a yearlong study of standards.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
