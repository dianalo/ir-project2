The survey, which was prepared for the National Cable Television Association, an industry group, is the first of its kind since deregulation took effect in January. The cable industry is expected to use the survey's results to dispute contentions that deregulation has given the cable industry too much power to jack up prices.    The survey showed that rates for basic cable service have increased an average of 10.6% since deregulation, but have been accompanied by a 2.5% decrease in prices for extra services, such as pay-movie channels. The survey found more services being offered on cable, but fewer complicated and expensive package deals.    Over the six-month period, the survey found, the percentage of subscriber homes in areas served by cable remained unchanged at 56.7%. In addition, the survey said, the rate of disconnection of cable services -- typical measures of customer disatisfaction with cable -- has declined slightly since January.    The random-sample mail survey covered 600 systems serving 16% of the nation's 42.3 million subscribers. </TEXT></DOC>
