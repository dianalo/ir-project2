tagnum="10"><T2>SUMMARY: </T2>Congress recently enacted the Drug-Free Workplace Actof 1988. This statute requires that all grantees receiving grants fromany Federal agency certify to that agency that they will maintain a drug-freeworkplace, or, in the case of a grantee who is an individual, certify tothe agency that his or her conduct of grant activity will be drug-free.This governmentwide rule is for the purpose of implementing the statutoryrequirements. It directs that grantees take steps to provide a drug-freeworkplace in accordance with the Act.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>This rule is effective March 18, 1989.

L. 100-690, Title V, Subtitle D). This statute requires contractorsand grantees of Federal agencies to certify that they will provide drug-freeworkplaces. Making the required certification is a precondition for receivinga contract or grant from a Federal agency.Requirements pertaining to contractors will be found in a separate interimfinal rule amending the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR; 48 CFR Subparts9.4, 23.5, and 52.2). This governmentwide common rulemaking concerns onlygrants (including cooperative agreements). This common rule will be thesole authority for implementing the Act, i.e., there will be no separateagency guidance issued. Because the statute makes use of existing suspensionand debarment remedies for noncompliance with drug-free workplace requirements,the agencies have determined to implement the statute through an amendmentto the existing governmentwide nonprocurement suspension and debarmentcommon rule. Using this vehicle will allow the agencies to take advantageof existing administrative procedures and definitions, minimizing regulatoryduplication.In a matter unrelated to the Drug-Free Workplace Act, the May 26, 1988,common rule on nonprocurement suspension and debarment (53 FR 19161) containedinterim final language concerning coverage of international transactions.The comment period on this language ended July 25, 1988. There were nocomments. As a result, the international transactions language will remainunchanged.<ITAG tagnum="84">Section-by-Section Analysis</ITAG>The core of the drug-free workplace rule is a new Subpart F, which willbe added to the current nonprocurement suspension and debarment commonrule. Conforming changes are being made to other affected portions of thenonprocurement suspension and debarment common rule. The title of the part,as well as the authority citations, are being modified to refer to thedrug-free workplace requirements being added to the regulation. Section<T2>XX</T2>.305, which concerns grounds for debarment, is being amendedto add violation of drug-free workplace requirements as a ground for debarment.Section <T2>XX</T2>.320, concerning the period of debarment, is being amended toconform with the longer period for debarment authorized by the statutefor a violation of drug-free workplace requirements. Generally, debarmentsfor other than a violation of the drug-free workplace requirements do notexceed three years. In view of the seriousness with which Congress takesdrug abuse, Congress authorized debarments of up to five years for a violationof drug-free workplace requirements.Subpart F is intended to carry out the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988,as it applies to Federal grant programs. Section <T2>XX</T2>.600, ``Purpose,'' states this intent, indicating the requirementfor both individuals and other grantees to make the certification requiredby the statute.Section <T2>XX</T2>.605 includes several definitions. Since Subpart F is part ofthe suspension and debarment regulation, the definitions of the overallregulation (from andSection; <T2>XX</T2>.105) apply to Subpart F, except where amended in this section.The definitions of ``controlled substance,'' ``conviction,'' ``criminaldrug statute'' and ``employee'' are taken verbatim from the statute. Thedefinition of ``drug-free workplace'' is also taken directly from the statute,with the word ``grantee'' used in place of the undefined statutory ``entity''in order to ensure terminological consistency throughout the regulation.The term ``site for the performance of work'' within this definition isnot further defined. It is intended that the grantee will determine whatthe ``site for the performance of work'' is and specify such in the grantee'scertification. The definition of ``grant'' is adapted from the definition of this termin the grants management governmentwide common rule (``Uniform AdministrativeRequirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments'').Four points should be highlighted. First, for the purpose of the Drug-FreeWorkplace Act, grants include block grants and entitlement grant programs,whether or not exempted from coverage under the grants management commonrule. Second, nonprocurement transactions entered into under Pub. L. 93-638,the ``Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act,'' are includedunder the subpart's requirements. Third, the term grant includes <T3>only </T3>assistance from an agency <T3>directly </T3>to a grantee. That is, if a Federal agency provides financialassistance to a State agency, which in turn passes through the assistanceto several local agencies, only the State agency that receives the assistancedirectly from the Federal agency, and not the local agency, gets a ``grant.''Consequently, it is only the State agency that is required to make a drug-freeworkplace certification under the regulation. Fourth, section 5301 of Subtitle G, Title V of the Anti-Drug Abuse Actof 1988 (Pub. L. 100-690) specifies that ``Federal benefits'' may (or shall)be withheld, in certain circumstances, from convicted drug offenders. Theterm ``Federal benefit,'' however, is defined by section 5301(d) to exclude``any * * * veterans benefits,'' a term which is defined, in turn, to include``all benefits provided to veterans, their families, or survivors by virtueof the service of a veteran in the Armed Forces of the United States.''Consequently, it is clear that, under Public Law 100-690, Federal agenciesmay not deny veterans' benefits to individuals on the basis of actual drugconvictions. Consistent with the intent of section 5301, the agencies have determinedthat veterans' benefits may not be denied to individuals on the basis ofdrug abuse which does not result in a conviction for violating a criminaldrug statute or on the basis of the individual's failure to certify thathe or she will refrain from drug abuse. Consequently, the definition ofthe term grant specifically excludes ``any veterans' benefits to individuals_i.e.,any benefit provided to veterans, their families, or survivors by virtueof the service of a veteran in the Armed Forces of the United States.''``Grantee'' is defined as a person who applies for or receives a grantdirectly from a Federal agency. This definition clarifies the statutorydefinition of this term, which refers to ``the department, division, orother unit of a person responsible for section. ``Individual'' is definedin this section, however, to mean ``a natural person.'' This wording emphasizesthat an individual differs both from an organization made up of more thanone individual and from corporations, which can be regarded as a single``person'' for some legal purposes. An individual who receives a grantdirectly from a Federal agency (e.g., the individual gets a Federal agencyaward and grant check made out in his or her name) is covered by this rule,and must make the certification provided for grantees who are individuals,even if another party (e.g., a university) has a purely administrativerole in distributing the funds. The agencies intend that a ``principalinvestigator'' in a research or similar grant be viewed as an individualonly if the grant is awarded directly to the investigator (as distinctfrom being awarded to a university or other organization). The andSection; <T2>XX</T2>.105 definition of ``person,'' it should be pointed out, includesindividuals. Since a ``grantee'' is a ``person'' who applies for or receivesa grant, a grantee may be either an individual or an organization. Whencontext requires, as in distinguishing between the certifications thatindividuals and organizations must submit, phrases like ``grantees, otherthan individuals'' and ``grantees who are individuals'' are used. The definition of ``Federal agency'' or ``agency'' is taken from 5 U.S.C.552(f) and is intended to cover a broad range of government entities. Invarious places in the regulation, ``the agency'' is used in the contextof a particular grantor agency (e.g., andSection; <T2>XX</T2>.630(a); ``each grantee shall make the appropriate performanceunder the grant.'' The agencies view the regulatory definition as avoidingconfusion among the terms ``grantee,'' ``person'' and ``individual'' thatmight otherwise occur. At the same time, the use of ``grantee'' in this regulation is intendedto be consistent with the statutory sense of the term. For example, indetermining the level of organization at which a sanction should be imposedin case of a violation of the requirements of this subpart, the agenciesintend, where appropriate, to focus on the ``department, division, or otherunit'' of the grantee responsible for performance under the grant. Forexample, if several different organizational units of a State agency receivegrants from a Federal agency, and one of the State organizational unitsviolates a requirement of the regulation, sanctions could be imposed onthat organizational unit, not on the entire State agency. On the otherhand, where it is appropriate, in the context of a particular Federal grantprogram, to view the entire grantee organization as responsible for theimplementation of drug-free workplace requirements under this rule, theentire grantee organization could be subject to sanctions. As in the definition of ``grant,'' the use of the word ``directly'' emphasizesthat it is only a ``prime grantee,'' and not ``subgrantees,'' who are coveredby requirements under this subpart. This is true even when the prime granteeis only an office that passes Federal funds through to subgrantees whoactually do the work of the program. Words like ``State'' and ``person'' are already defined in andSection; <T2>XX</T2>.105, so definitions of these terms are not repeated in thiscertification to the agency''). In such contexts, the term is not intendedto mean Federal agencies in general. Section andSection; <T2>XX</T2>.610 applies the provisions of the subpart to any grantee ofan agency. The remainder of the suspension and debarment rule applies tosuspensions and debarments under subpart F. In the event of any conflictor inconsistency, subpart F provisions are deemed to control with respectto drug-free workplace matters. Section <T2>XX</T2>.615 lists the grounds for which sanctions can be imposed. Theimposition of sanctions requires a written determination of violation fromthe ``agency head'' or designee. The first ground for which a grantee can be sanctioned is for making afalse certification. The second ground is to violate the certificationby failing to comply with the requirements of the certification (e.g.,an organization that never publishes a drug-free workplace statement).The third ground for sanctions is that ``such a number of employees ofthe grantee'' have been convicted of criminal drug violations occurringin the workplace ``as to indicate that the grantee has failed to make agood faith effort to provide a drug-free workplace.'' This is a standardthat must be applied by agencies on a case-by-case basis. The facts andcircumstances of grantees and employee drug problems vary so much thatit would be virtually impossible to prescribe an across-the-board standardfor how many convictions it would take before an agency would find a granteein violation. It is clear, however, that criminal drug violations by employeesnot occurring in the workplace would not trigger this determination. Likewise,evidence of drug abuse by employees in the workplace that does not resultin criminal convictions would not trigger this determination. Section <T2>XX</T2>.620 provides three kinds of sanctions for grantees who arefound in violation under andSection; <T2>XX</T2>.615. The first is suspension (i.e., withholding) of paymentsunder the grant. The second is suspension or termination of the grant itself.The third is suspension or debarment of the grantee. The decision of whichsanction or sanctions to apply in a particular case is left to the discretionof the Federal grantor agency. As with other debarments, the debarred granteeis ineligible for any grant award from any Federal agency during the termof the debarment, which may be up to five years in the case of a debarmentfor a violation of this subpart. Section <T2>XX</T2>.625 allows the agency head_but no other official in the agency_towaive a sanction imposed under andSection; <T2>XX</T2>.620 if the agency head finds the sanction to be not in thepublic interest. The determination of the ``public interest'' ground forthe waiver is within the discretion of the agency head. The waiver mustbe in writing. Section <T2>XX</T2>.630 establishes what grantees must do in order to receive grants,in light of drug-free workplace requirements. Each grantee shall make theappropriate certification (as set forth in Appendix C) as a ``prior condition''of being awarded a grant. This means that the agencies may not award thegrant unless the certification has been made. Normally, the agencies wouldmake the certification part of the grant application or proposal process,so that each grantee would make the certification in the process of seekingto obtain the funds. The agencies are aware that, in some grant programs, there are no formalapplications or proposals for funding in which a certification could beincluded (e.g., formula grant programs in which grantees are entitled toreceive Federal funds). Also, as this regulation goes into effect, applicationswill already have been submitted for some grant programs, and only theactual award has to take place before the grant becomes effective. In bothcases, grantees are required to make their certifications before the actualaward of a grant can take place. A grantee is required to make the required certification for each grant.The one exception to this rule is for a grantee which is a State (as definedin andSection; <T2>XX</T2>.105), including a State agency. A State may elect to make asingle annual certification to each agency from which it obtains grants,rather than making a separate certification for each grant or each workplace.Only one such annual certification need be made to each Federal grantoragency, which would cover all of that State agency's workplaces. Consequently,if a State agency receives grants under a number of different programsfrom the same Federal agency, only one certification, rather than multiple,annual certifications, has to be made to that Federal agency. Grantees are not required to make certifications in order to continue receivingpayments under existing grants. That is, if a grant has been approved andawarded before the effective date of this regulation, the grantee doesnot have to take any action under this regulation in order to continuereceiving payments under the grant. On the same rationale, grantees wouldnot be required to make a certification before a no-cost time extensionof an existing grant. The requirements of this rule operate only prospectively.The text of the certification required to be submitted by andSection; <T2>XX</T2>.630 is found in Appendix C. There are two different versionsof the Appendix C certification. One of them is for grantees other thanindividuals; the other is for individuals. Grantees must choose the appropriatecertification and make it as provided in andSection; <T2>XX</T2>.630. The Appendix C certification for grantees other than individuals (AlternateI) incorporates the statutory requirements for a drug-free workplace program.These requirements are largely self-explanatory. Grantee's costs incurredspecifically to comply with the requirements of subpart F are regardedas allowable costs under the grant. The agencies point out that, undersubparagraph (f)(2), employers are not required by the common rule to provideor pay for rehabilitation programs. The applicable Appendix C certification for grantees who are individuals(Alternate II) provides that the individual will not engage in prohibitedpractices with respect to drugs in conducting any activity with the grant.Again, this certification simply incorporates the statutory requirementfor individual grantees. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Process Matters </ITAG>This rule is a non-major rule under Executive Order 12291. The agencieshave evaluated the rule under Executive Order 12612, pertaining to Federalism.The statute requires drug-free workplace certifications to be made by allgrantees, including State agencies. The rule does reduce burdens on Stategrantees by allowing State agencies to elect an annual certification toeach Federal grantor agency in lieu of a certification for every grant.For these reasons, the agencies have determined that the rule will nothave sufficient Federalism implications to warrant the preparation of aFederalism Assessment. As a statutory matter, this rule must apply to all grantees, regardlessof size. (The statute does provide a shorter, less burdensome certificationto be made by grantees who are individuals, however.) Costs incurred bygrantees for drug-free workplace programs are directly mandated by statute;the agencies have minimal regulatory discretion in designing this regulation.This rule contains information collection requirements subject to the PaperworkReduction Act. The information collection requirements concern employeesreporting drug offense convictions to grantees, grantees reporting theseconvictions to the agencies, and grantees listing the location(s) of theirworkplace(s) as part of the certification. These requirements have beenreviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget, with OMBControl Number 0991-0002. The agencies find that publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking on thismatter would be impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the publicinterest, since it would prevent compliance with the statutory deadline(90 days from the statute's date of enactment) for issuance of final rules.This finding is also based on the agencies' view that, given the urgencyof implementing appropriate means to combat the nation's serious drug problem,the additional time involved with the publication of a notice of proposedrulemaking would adversely affect the achievement of the national objectiveestablished by Congress. In addition, this rulemaking pertains only to agency grants. For this reason,under 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2), the rulemaking is exempt from the requirementfor prior notice and comment (except for those agencies that do not assertthis exemption). Consequently, this rule is published as an interim final rule. As an interimfinal rule, this regulation is fully in effect and binding after its effectivedate. No further regulatory action by the agencies is essential to thelegal effectiveness of the rule. In order to benefit from comments thatinterested parties and the public may make, however, the agencies willkeep the rulemaking docket open for 60 days. Comments are invited, on allportions of the rulemaking, through April 3, 1989. Following the closeof the comment period, the agencies will publish a notice responding tothe comments and, if appropriate, amending provisions of this rule.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="69"> <ITAG tagnum="84">Text of the Common Rule </ITAG>The text of the common rule, as adopted by the agencies in this document,appears below.<ITAG tagnum="56">PART <T2>XX</T2>_GOVERNMENTWIDE DEPARTMENT AND SUSPENSION (NON-PROCUREMENT)AND GOVERNMENTWIDE REQUIREMENTS FOR DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE (GRANTS)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; </ITAG><T2>XX</T2>.305 <ITAG tagnum="89">Causes for debarment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *    </ITAG>(c) * * *    (5) Violation of any requirement of Subpart F of this part, relating toproviding a drug-free workplace, as set forth in andSection; <T2>XX</T2>.615 of this part.<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; </ITAG><T2>XX</T2>.320 <ITAG tagnum="89">Period of debarment.    </ITAG>(a) Debarment shall be for a period commensurate with the seriousness ofthe cause(s).

(202) 755-9886 (This is not a toll-freenumber.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>By publication of this separatepreamble the Department adopts the interim amendments to the common ruleon nonprocurement debarment and suspension.The Drug-Free Work Place Act of 1988 requires that regulations be issuednot later than 90 days after the date of enactment and that the Act willbecome effective 120 days after enactment. Since enactment occurred afterHUD's most recent Agenda submission to the Congressional oversight committees,this rule was not included in that agenda and would normally be subjectto legislative review under section 7(o) of the Department of Housing andUrban Development Act. Because of the limited time periods involved, HUDwill be unable to comply with the Congressional review requirements andalso meet the legislative mandate for early effectiveness. Therefore, theDepartment is joining in the common rule.The provisions of this subpart apply to recipients of all HUD grants includingCDBG formula grant recipients not otherwise subject to sanctions underPart 24. Certifications required under this subpart should be submittedby formula grant recipients in conjunction with other required certifications.Additionally, Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) that receive HUD grantsthrough annual contributions contracts are grantees who are subject tothe requirements in this subpart. The certification required by this subpartis in addition to the requirement that PHAs include a provision in tenants'leases making drug-related criminal activity grounds for terminating thelease.On December 28, 1988, the Department published a <T4>Federal Register </T4>Notice implementing amendments to the ComprehensiveHomeless Assistance Plan (CHAP) (53 FR 52600) contained in the StewartB. McKinney Homeless Assistance Amendments Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-628),approved November 7, 1988). One of these provisions required all applicantsfor assistance under the McKinney Act (including the Emergency ShelterGrants, Supportive Housing, Single Room Occupancy, and Supplemental Assistancefor Facilities to Assist the Homeless programs) to include in their CHAPSan assurance that the homeless facility would be drug- and alcohol-free.The Notice further advised applicants that additional drug-related requirementsmight apply to the McKinney homeless assistance programs under the Anti-DrugAbuse Act of 1988. Applicants should note that they must comply with therequirements of this common rule and with the certification provisionsunder the 1988 CHAP Notice.The existing Subpart F Limited Denial of Participation, has been redesignatedas Subpart G.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 24 CFR Part 24</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Debarment and suspension (nonprocurement),Drug abuse, Government contracts, Organization and functions (GovernmentAgencies), Government procurement, Grant programs: housing and communitydevelopment, Loan programs: housing and community development.Title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended as set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="6">Samuel Pierce,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Secretary, United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="56">PART 24_GOVERNMENT DEBARMENT AND SUSPENSION (NONPROCUREMENT) AND GOVERNMENTWIDEREQUIREMENTS FOR DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE (GRANTS)</ITAG>1.

Consistent with the statutoryprovisions of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, the definition of ``grant''set forth in the common rule, however, makes it clear that, for purposesof the provisions applicable to individuals, the term ``grant'' shall notbe construed to include ``any veterans benefit_i.e., any benefit providedto veterans, their families, or survivors by virtue of the service of veteranin the Armed Forces of the United States.'' Accordingly, individual beneficiariesof ``veterans benefits'' will not be required to comply with the Drug FreeWorkplace Act of 1988 as a condition to the receipt of such benefits.Otherwise, the common rule shall apply to grant programs administered bythe VA, such as the State Veterans Home Program and the State CemeteryGrants Program, which provide for the granting of assistance other than``veterans benefits'' to recipients such as State governments. In suchcases, the VA will require from such grantees compliance with the Drug-FreeWorkplace Act of 1988, including its certification requirements, as a conditionfor the future receipt of such assistance.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 38 CFR Part 44</ITAG>Accounting, Administrative practice and procedures, Agreements, Debarmentand suspension (nonprocurement), Drug abuse, Drug-free workplace, Grantprograms_State cemetery and State veterans homes, Insurance, Loan guaranty,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Scholarships, Veterans, Vocationalrehabilitation and education.<ITAG tagnum="21">Title 38 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended as set forthbelow.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Approved: January 18, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Thomas K.
