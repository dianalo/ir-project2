Products from mineral oil and natural gas will haveto be substituted by other, especially synthesized secondary sourcesof energy such as, for instance, hydrogen. Due to this tendency it becomesdesirable for today's coal-hydrogen oriented energy industry to concentrateon hydrogen alone. Water is a raw material with unlimited supply; inthe long run there is sufficient solar energy apart from hydro- and nuclearpower even though industrial utilization of solar energy becomes possibleonly when a substance like hydrogen, which can be stored and transportedover large distances serves as the carrier of energy. Hydrogen is anecologically unobjectionable substance and can therefore be used unconstraintedlyfor heat and power generation which again allows to link up industryand energy management. A smooth transition could be achieved by initiallyusing fossil-based hydrogen and going on to use more and more non fossil-basedhydrogen in the existing infrastructure. The technologies for the productionand utilization of hydrogen are basically known but need to be furtherdeveloped for large-scale industrial, economic and safe use. Technologiesfor production, storage, transport, transformation utilization and safehandling of hydrogen are therefore being worked upon very intensively.The 15 papers presented on this conference are dealt with in separateabstracts.</TEXT></DOC>
