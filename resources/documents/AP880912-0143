Zbigniew Brzezinski, the most prominent Democrat on the13-member panel, told reporters he was proud to have served Carterbut said Bush _ rather than Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis _``can best fashion an effective bipartisan foreign policy.''   Said Brzezinski: ``He is not a novice in that critical area ofpublic policy on which our national survival depends.''   Bush took the occasion to accuse Dukakis of tending to rely onthe United Nations and other international bodies to resolveforeign crises. ``We cannot abdicate our responsibility forleadership,'' he said.   The panel also includes Henry Kissinger, national securityadviser to Nixon and secretary of state under Ford, and BrentScowcroft, who was Ford's national security adviser.   Others named to the largely Republican panel were formerSecretary of State Alexander Haig, former ambassador AnneArmstrong, former White House chief of staff Howard Baker; MelvinLaird and Donald Rumsfeld, former secretaries of defense; Sens.Jesse Helms, R-N.C., Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., and Richard Lugar,R-Ind.; former Sen. John Tower, R-Texas, and retired Adm. Elmo R.Zumwalt Jr., former chief of naval operations.   Brzezinski's endorsement of Bush was ``not unexpected,'' saidMark Gearan, a spokesman at Dukakis campaign headquarters in Boston.   ``We will be watching to see whether Mr. Brzezinski will bedrafting speeches for George Bush on the foreign policy of JimmyCarter,'' said Gearan, alluding to repeated GOP attacks on Carter'stenure.   On Monday, Dukakis delivered the first of three major campaignspeeches this week that are intended to counter Republicanallegations that he is weak on defense and naive about foreignaffairs.   ``The primary foreign policy objective of the Dukakisadministration can be stated very simply: to restore respect forAmerican leadership in a changing world,'' Dukakis told a campaignrally in Philadelphia.   He accused Bush of failed leadership in combating terrorism,drug trafficking and U.S. deficits in world trade.   Dukakis has no formal advisory panel of national securityexperts for his campaign. Madeleine Albright has been his chiefforeign affairs adviser for the past year.   In addition to Ms. Albright, who served in the Carter WhiteHouse and is a professor at Georgetown University, Dukakis receivesadvice on those issues from Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., Rep. Les Aspin,D-Wis., and a trio from the Kennedy School of Government at HarvardUniversity. They are Joseph Nye, Graham Allison and AlbertCarnesdale.   Kissinger said in a statement he had ``read everything I couldfind on foreign and national security policy uttered by Gov.Dukakis _ which is admittedly a skimpy body of work.''   ``I am convinced that his views on national security areincompatible with a strong America, his approach to East-Westrelations would undermine our ability to move the Soviet Uniontoward more responsible behavior, and his view of internationalaffairs would keep us from shaping the new world decades ofdedication have brought into view,'' Kissinger said.   Scowcroft told the same news conference that Dukakis ``iswithout experience in foreign affairs, and his penchant formultilateral diplomacy fails to recognize the vital role of dynamicU.S. leadership in moving regional conflicts toward resolutionscompatible with U.S. interests.''</TEXT></DOC>
