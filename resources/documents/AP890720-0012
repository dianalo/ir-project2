The multibillion-dollar cleanup plan would set four newcategories for cities with ozone problems _ severe, serious,moderate or marginal _ and require the most polluted communities touse the most stringent remedies.   The Associated Press obtained a draft of the proposal, and thenapplied the latest available Environmental Protection Agency airmonitoring data to determine which cities would fall into the twomost serious ozone pollution categories.   There could be some changes when new air quality informationbecomes available, probably next month, but EPA officials said thenumber of switches should be small.   Ozone is a highly reactive gas that irritates and inflamessensitive lung tissues. This causes a host of adverse healtheffects, including chest pains, shortness of breath, coughing,nausea, throat irritation and increased susceptibility torespiratory infections.   The current EPA data would place these areas in the ``serious''category for a 10-year cleanup: Chicago-Gary, Ind.;Cincinnati-Hamilton, Ohio; Hartford-New Britain-Middletown, Conn.;Milwaukee-Racine, Wis.; Philadelphia-Wilmington, Del.-Trenton, N.J.;Providence-Pawtucket, R.I.-Fall River, Mass.; Atlanta; Baltimore;Baton Rouge, La.; Beaumont-Port Arthur, Texas; El Paso, Texas;Huntington, W.Va.-Ashland, Ky.; Louisville, Ky.; Portland, Maine;San Diego; Sheboygan, Wis.; Springfield, Mass.; St. Louis; and theDistrict of Columbia.   EPA officials verified both the list of 19 areas that would begiven 10 years to correct ozone problems and the three cities in thesevere, 20-year cleanup category.   William Becker, executive director of the State and TerritorialAir Pollution Program Administrators, the organization of state andlocal air pollution officials, also said he did not expect manychanges in the cities' classifications.   Bush is expected to submit the bill to Congress as early asFriday. The top 80 metropolitan areas in the country, and about 15rural areas, are out of compliance with U.S. clean air standardsunder current law.   The Bush proposal is only one way of attacking the ozone problem,and environmentalists and their supporters in Congress are expectedto push for their own proposals.   The EPA estimates that nationwide ozone cleanup efforts wouldcost $5 billion to $10 billion a year through the year 2000 and $8billion to $12 billion a year afterward.   The Bush administration legislation envisions the ozone cleanupas being financed largely by industries, including petroleum,automobile, paint and ink producers. Many of the costs would likelybe passed on to consumers.   The bill would order national measures including new controls onmotor vehicle emissions, hazardous waste facilities, and smallersources of pollutants such as consumer solvents. Oil companies wouldhave to tighten volatility requirements for gasolines.   The ``severe'' and ``serious'' areas also would need to havestricter inspection and maintenance programs for motor vehicles;capture emissions from refueling at the gas pump; and EPA-orderedcontrols on seven additional categories of industrial or commercialsources of pollution.   These areas would be required to reduce ozone emissions at anaverage rate of 3 percent a year _ for 20 years, in the case ofseverely polluted areas and for 10 years for the serious areas.   The Bush plan includes a series of existing and new penaltiesthat could be imposed on areas that fail to comply with the law.These steps, which have been applied sparingly by EPA, include amoratorium on construction of anything that would increasepollution, loss of federal highway funds, restrictions on newdrinking water hookups, and withholding money to run clean airprograms.</TEXT></DOC>
