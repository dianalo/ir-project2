In reality, however, the so-called reformsgutted a budget law that was working -- Gramm-Rudman -- andreplaced it with a process that allows higher spending andlarger deficits.   This has been made all too clear by the new budgetprojections in the administration's Mid-Session Review of theBudget, which was released last month. Even though theestimated 1992 deficit has been boosted an additional $67.4billion to $348.3 billion, Budget Director Richard Darmanactually contends, &quot;The budget reforms enacted in 1990 havebeen working.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Since genuine deficit targets no longer exist, Mr. Darmantechnically is correct. For most Americans, however, budgetreforms that facilitate higher spending and larger deficitsprobably would receive failing marks. The administration'smid-year budget estimates confirm that spending will risemuch faster under the highly touted 1990 Budget EnforcementAct than it did when the 1985 Gramm-Rudman-Hollings DeficitReduction Act was in force.   Indeed, federal spending will consume a peacetime record24.9% of gross national product by next year, up from 22.3%in 1989. The deficit, which declined under Gramm-Rudman to 3%of GNP in 1989, will account for 5% of GNP this year and 5.8%in 1992.   Last year's budget reforms include annual caps on defense,international, and domestic discretionary spending through1993. While spending caps are a good idea in theory, thecurrent caps are poor fiscal policy in practice. Spendingcaps are like speed limits: If they are set too high, theyhave no impact. Unfortunately, the new spending caps are like100-mile-per-hour speed limits, permitting domesticdiscretionary spending to increase by an average of 7%annually. Since inflation is expected to average less than3.7% yearly over the same period, domestic discretionaryspending will grow nearly twice as fast as needed to keeppace with inflation. By contrast, under Gramm-Rudman,domestic discretionary spending was nearly held to the rateof inflation.   The fastest growing part of the budget, entitlementspending, is completely exempt from spending caps. As aresult (not even counting the costs of the deposit insurancebailout), so-called mandatory spending will climb by anaverage of 8.1% annually through 1996, nearly 2 1/2 times therate needed to keep pace with projected inflation. UnderGramm-Rudman, however, entitlement spending was reined in,growing only marginally faster than inflation.   And actual spending figures under the new budget processalmost certainly will be even worse than currently estimated.Under the Budget Enforcement Act, unlike Gramm-Rudman, theability to spend money automatically expands when economicassumptions change, technical re-estimates are made, and&quot;emergency&quot; spending is enacted. These loopholes already havepermitted 1991 domestic discretionary spending to rise 1.2%above the original target and international discretionaryspending to climb 9.1% over the level set last year.   Entitlement spending also can take advantage of theseloopholes. Just since the administration's February budget,technical re-estimates for 1992-96 have added $64 billion toMedicaid, $7 billion to farm spending, and $8.5 billion forfood stamps. Under Gramm-Rudman, lawmakers were bound byfixed deficit targets, and while phony economic assumptionsand other budget gimmicks often were used to partially evadethe law's discipline, the incentive to cheat was limited --since phony savings in one year simply made it that muchharder to reach the deficit target the following year. Underthe new law, however, fixed deficit targets have beenreplaced by &quot;adjustable&quot; ones, greatly increasing lawmakers'incentives to use inaccurate economic and technicalassumptions.   The other highly touted feature of the Budget EnforcementAct is the pay-as-you-go provision requiring that all newlegislation be deficit neutral. Like the spending caps, thepay-as-you-go provision doubtlessly will block some spending.But pay-as-you-go restrictions are hardly a new feature; theyhave existed since Gramm-Rudman was enacted in 1985.   Furthermore, while the pay-as-you-go provision helps avertsome spending, its usefulness is blunted, since spending andrevenue estimates are provided by the increasingly partisanCongressional Budget Office. CBO's economic &quot;model&quot; assumestaxes have little effect on economic behavior. As such, CBOroutinely over-estimates how much revenue will result fromtax increases, as last year's tax increase and subsequentdecline in the growth of tax revenue clearly indicate. CBOalso puts ideology ahead of economics by arguing that payrolltax reduction would lower economic growth and that acapital-gains tax cut would reduce tax revenues. Similarly,CBO has a track record of underestimating the cost of newprograms, as the catastrophic health insurance debacleproved.   Taxpayers and the economy would be better off today hadpolicy makers simply kept Gramm-Rudman. It worked. Adjustedfor inflation, the growth of federal spending fell by 65%after Gramm-Rudman was enacted in 1985. Under the new budgetreforms, spending growth is accelerating once again. With theexception of President Bush's first year in office, thedeficit consumed a smaller percentage of the GNP every yearthat Gramm-Rudman was in effect. By contrast, the deficit isnow projected to reach 5.8% of GNP by 1992, nearly twice asbig as it was when Ronald Reagan left office.   When supporters of the budget deal last year said theprocess reform portion of the agreement was a victory, theyfailed to specify for whom. It is now clear that the winnerwas the Washington establishment. Not only did it get arecord tax increase that has facilitated record spendingincreases, it also got rid of Gramm-Rudman and the fiscaldiscipline the law imposed.   ---   Mr. Mitchell is a fellow at the Heritage Foundation inWashington.</TEXT></DOC>
