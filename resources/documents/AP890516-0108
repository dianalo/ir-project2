The death of student Lee Chol-kyu has affected relations withWashington, as Seoul warned that a State Department official'sremarks about the death could harm relations.   Police all over the nation were on alert after dissidents calledfor demonstrations to mark the anniversary this week of a 1980uprising in southeastern Kwangju. At least 192 people were killedin the nine-day rebellion.   Witnesses said 10,000 students and citizens chantinganti-government slogans marched in Kwangju on Tuesday to protestLee's death.   ``Down with (President) Roh Tae-woo!'' they yelled when theirmarch was blocked by riot police guarding the provincial governmentheadquarters.   Thousands of protesters have demonstrated every day in downtownKwangju since the radical student's body was found Wednesday in areservoir near the city, which is about 170 miles south of Seoul.   Dissidents allege Lee was tortured to death by police and thatauthorities have doctored pathology tests to show that he drowned.   Students staged street protests in two other provincial cities,Taejon and Chonju, according to the official Yonhap news agency.   In Seoul, police fired tear gas Tuesday to disperse about 300radical students trying to march from Sungkyunkwan University withfirebombs. It was the first violent clash since six policemen diedMay 3 in a campus confrontation.   Many students, sensing public anger at the officers' deaths,renounced violent tactics.   The Seoul government said U.S. comments last week on Lee's deathwere incorrect.   ``Unnecessary comment on internal matters, particularly on asituation in which it does not know the truth, would not be of helpto the U.S.-Korea alliance or friendly relations,'' a ForeignMinistry official said on condition of anonymity.   The warning responded to remarks by a State Department officialwho called Lee's death ``a deplorable event.''   ``We do not know who may have committed this atrocious act,''the State Department official said, but ``the murderers will beexposed and severely punished.''   South Korea lodged a protest in Washington, contending it hasnot been proved that Lee was murdered. The State Department saidMonday it did not intend to prejudge how Lee died.   Police had sought Lee for anti-state acts and prosecutorsbelieve the student fell into a reservoir and drowned while fleeingpolice.   Dissidents and radical students are trying to use the growingfuror over Lee's death to step up their campaign to topple Roh.   The opposition-controlled National Assembly convened 16committees Tuesday to investigate Lee's death and other issues.Opposition parties contend the government is using radical violenceas a pretext to subdue all opposition groups.   Roh has ordered a crackdown on the dissidents he accuses ofthreatening stability and democracy. The Justice Ministry announced587 people have been charged or arrested this year for violentprotests and anti-state activities.</TEXT></DOC>
