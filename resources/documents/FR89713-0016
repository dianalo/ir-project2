Two recent decisions of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuithave held that even though the BPAI includes a new ground for rejectionin its decision under 37 CFR 1.196(b)(3), appellants may appeal directlyto the Federal Circuit without first seeking reconsideration at the BPAI.Where judicial review is sought without requesting reconsideration, thearguments against the new ground of rejection are developed for the firsttime during court proceedings. The amendments require that appellants seekreconsideration of the new ground of rejection prior to appeal or commencementof a civil action. Experience under the previous rules relating to judicial review of finalboard decisions indicated that the rules may have been confusing in certainrespects relating to the time in which judicial review must be sought andthe manner in which extensions of time for seeking judicial review maybe obtained. The rules eliminate any confusion as to when judicial reviewmust be sought and standardize the manner of obtaining extensions of timeto seek judicial review. The rules also make clarifying and housekeeping amendments with respectto practice before the BPAI.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>August 20, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Richard E.

No oral hearing was held andno written comments were received. Discussion of Specific Rules <ITAG tagnum="81">(1) Decisions of the BPAI and Requests for Reconsideration of BPAIand TTAB Decisions </ITAG>Only final decisions of the BPAI and TTAB are subject to judicial review.35 U.S.C. 141, 145; 15 U.S.C. 1071; 28 U.S.C. 1295(a)(4) (A) and (B). Section 1.196(b) provides that if the BPAI has knowledge of any grounds,not involved in the appeal, for rejecting any appealed claim, it may includein its decision a statement to that effect. The statement then constitutesa new rejection of the claims. The previous rules permitted appellantsto treat the decision as a final decision in the case and thus immediatelyappealable. 37 CFR 1.196(b)(3) (1988). Therefore, when an appellant proceededunder this option, arguments against the new rejection were presented forthe first time to the reviewing court. A recent decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuitrejected the Commissioner's argument that an appellant should not be permittedto contest the BPAI's new ground for rejection because it had not requestedreconsideration of that ground by the BPAI. <T3>In re Evanega,</T3> 829 F.2d 1110, 1113, 4 USPQ 2d 1249, 1252 (Fed.Cir. 1987). <T3>See also In re Nielson,</T3> 816 F.2d 1567, 1570, 2 USPQ 2d 1525, 1527(Fed. Cir. 1987). In <T3>Evanega,</T3> the Commissioner urged that requiring appellants to requestreconsideration, where the BPAI adopts a new ground for rejection, wouldprovide the BPAI with an opportunity to consider appellant's argumentsand correct any errors while the case was still in the PTO. This conservesjudicial resources, and in any event, obtains the benefit of the BPAI'sview should judicial review ultimately be sought. The court held, however,that in view of PTO regulations (37 CFR 1.196(b)(3)) which ``expresslyprovide that the board's decision, even if based on a new ground, is afinal determination and thus may be appealed without seeking reconsideration,''appellant could not be required to request reconsideration by the BPAI.<T3>Id.</T3> The new rule changes eliminate 37 CFR 1.196(b)(3). By removing andSection;1.196(b)(3), appellants no longer have the option of treating a new groundof rejection as final and immediately appealable. Appellants' options arelimited to requesting remand to the examiner or requesting reconsiderationby the BPAI as set forth in andSection;andSection; 1.196(b)(1) and 1.196(b)(2).The preamble of andSection; 1.196(b) has been amended to specifically recitethat a new ground of rejection shall not be considered a final decisionfor judicial review. Appellants still may elect further prosecution before the examiner under37 CFR 1.196(b)(1) or request reconsideration under andSection; 1.196(b)(2).The option of andSection; 1.196(b)(2) requires that any request for reconsiderationaddress the new ground of rejection and specifically state the reasonswhy the new ground was in error. Section 1.196(b)(2) also provides thatthe BPAI will reconsider the new rejection and, if necessary, render anew decision. The decision on reconsideration will be deemed to incorporatethe earlier decision except for any portions of the earlier decision specificallywithdrawn. Reconsideration or remand need not be requested if appellant does not contestthe new ground. Appellants may seek judicial review as to claims not subjectto the new ground. Section 1.196(a) expressly provides for remands to the examiner for furtherconsideration. The BPAI has inherent authority, as part of its role inreviewing standards of patentability applied in the PTO, to remand applicationsto the examiner for further consideration. <T3>Cf.</T3> Manual of Patent Examining Procedure (MPEP) sections 1211and 1212. The change merely makes express that which is inherent. The amendments also delete the portion of former andSection; 1.196(d) whichprovides (1) that any decision which includes a remand shall not be a finaldecision for the purposes of judicial review, and (2) that upon conclusionof the proceedings on remand the BPAI may enter an order making its decisionfinal. Those provisions have been included as new andSection; 1.196(e). Underthis paragraph, decisions pursuant to andSection; 1.196(b) would not be finalas to the claims subject to a new rejection.The last sentence of former andSection; 1.196(b)(1) has been deleted andplaced in new andSection; 1.196(e). <ITAG tagnum="81">(2) Requests for Reconsideration of BPAI and TTAB Decisions </ITAG>Section 1.197(b) provides that any request for reconsideration must specificallystate the points believed to have been misapprehended or overlooked inthe BPAI's decision. Experience has shown that many requests for reconsiderationare nothing more than reargument of appellant's position on appeal. Theprovision, as adopted, limits requests to the points of law or fact whichappellant feels were overlooked or misapprehended by the BPAI. The amendments also clarify the exception found in the first sentence ofandSection; 1.197(b) by including specific references to the ``original decision''and the ``decision on reconsideration.'' Some confusion had been notedwith respect to the meaning of the current language. In order to simplify calculation of times for requesting reconsiderationof the decisions of the boards, andSection;andSection; 1.658(b), 2.129(c),and 2.144 specify a period of one month rather than the periods expressedin days. Section 1.197(a) already specified a one-month period. <ITAG tagnum="81">(3) Extensions of Time after a Decision by the BPAI to Take ActionUnder Sections 1.196 and 1.197 </ITAG>Appellants in patent cases may no longer use fee extensions under andSection;1.136(a) to extend the time for making an election under andSection; 1.196(b)or seeking reconsideration under andSection; 1.197. Under previous rulesappellants could request reconsideration of a BPAI decision up to fivemonths after a decision or file a response to a new ground of rejectionup to six months after the decision. This inordinately delayed final dispositionof appeals. Section 1.136(a) provides that fee extensions are not availableto file responses to a BPAI decision pursuant to andSection;andSection; 1.196,1.197 or andSection; 1.304. One month is deemed to be ample time to submita request for reconsideration. Note that Fed. R. Civ. P. 59 provides 10days and Fed. R. App. P. 40 provides 14 days for similar requests. Extensionsunder andSection; 1.136(b) will be available to extend the time to file aresponse under andSection;andSection; 1.196 and 1.197. Section 1.304(a) exclusivelygoverns extensions of time to file a notice of appeal to the U.S Courtof Appeals for the Federal Circuit or to commence a civil action. See furtherdiscussion below. Section 1.136(a) specifically refers to andSection; 1.136(b) for extensionsof time to file responses under andSection;andSection; 1.196 and 1.197 andrefers to andSection; 1.304 for extensions of time to initiate judicial review.Sections 1.196(f) and 1.197(b) correlatively reference andSection; 1.136(b)for extensions of time. Fee extensions are not available to extend the time for electing furtherprosecution before the examiner under andSection; 1.196(b)(1). Where an appellantelects further prosecution before the examiner, fee extensions under andSection;1.136(a) remain available to respond to the primary examiner's Office actions.<ITAG tagnum="81">(4) Time for Seeking Judicial Review of Decisions of the BPAI andTTAB </ITAG>Under previous rules, judicial review of final decisions of the BPAI orTTAB had to be sought within sixty days of the decision or thirty daysafter a decision on reconsideration. However, where a decision on reconsiderationwas, in effect, a new decision, it was not always clear whether the timefor appeal was thirty or sixty days. Sections 1.304(a) and 2.146(d)(1)provide a two-month period to appeal from either the date of the decisionor the decision on a timely filed request for reconsideration. Some problems have been noted with respect to the time for seeking judicialreview in days. Miscalculations of the statutory sixty-day time periodhave resulted in filing untimely requests for judicial review. In orderto simplify calculation of the time for seeking judicial review, andSection;andSection;1.304(a) and 2.145(d)(1) specify two months. The two-month period meetsthe sixty-day requirement of 35 U.S.C. 142, 145 and 146 and 15 U.S.C 1071(a)(2)and (b)(1) except for time periods which include February 28. In orderto comply with the sixty-day requirement, andSection;andSection; 1.304(b) and2.145(d)(2) provide that an additional day shall be added to any two-monthperiod for initiating judicial review which includes February 28. Appealswill always be timely if the judicial review is initiated within two monthsof the final decision. Previously, the rules did not specify a time period for filing a cross-appealor cross-action in <T3>inter partes </T3>cases. The absence of such a time period made itdifficult for parties and their attorneys to make appropriate plans forjudicial review. For example, in an interference where there has been asplit judgment, one of the parties may be satisfied with the judgment butmay desire to appeal the adverse judgment only if an appeal is noted bythe other party. Where the appeal is filed on the last possible day, across-appeal is precluded. Sections 1.304(a) and 2.145(d)(1) specify thatthe time for filing a cross-appeal or commencing a cross-action expires(1) fourteen days after service of the notice of appeal or the summonsand complaint or (2) two months after the decision to be reviewed, whicheveris later. Similarly, no provision for filing a cross-action was provided where anappellee elects to have further proceedings conducted in the district courtpursuant to 35 U.S.C. 146 or 15 U.S.C. 1071(a)(1). Section 1.304(c) and2.145(d)(3) provide that the time for filing a cross-action expires l4days after service of the summons and complaint. The district court willdetermine whether any cross-action was timely filed since neither the complaintnor cross-action is filed in the PTO. <ITAG tagnum="81">(5) Extensions of Time to Seek Judicial Review </ITAG>In the past, standards for granting requests for extensions of time totake an appeal or commence a civil action varied depending upon which boardwas involved and upon the particular type proceeding before the board.For example, extensions relating to patent applications could be obtainedby paying the appropriate fee under andSection; 1.136(a). However, in reexaminationproceedings or when judicial review was sought from a decision of the TTAB,the requester must demonstrate sufficient cause under andSection; 1.550(c)or andSection; 2.145(d)(1). The rules standardize the manner in which anextension of time to initiate judicial review may be obtained. The PTOhas adopted a standard which is similar to the standard used in the Federalcourts for granting extensions. Under the rules the Commissioner may extendthe time (1) for good cause if requested before the expiration of the timeprovided for initiating judicial review or (2) upon a showing of excusableneglect in failing to initiate judicial review if requested after the expirationof the time period. This standard will be applicable in both trademarkand patent proceedings (andSection;andSection; 1.304(a) and 2.145(e)) oncethe ``last'' decision, i.e., either the decision (in circumstances whereno timely reconsideration is sought) or the decision on reconsideration,of either board has been entered. In patent cases, extensions of time underandSection;andSection;1.136(b) and 1.550(c) and fee extensions under 37 CFR1.136(a) are no longer available to extend the time for the purpose ofjudicial review once a decision or a decision on reconsideration has beenentered. Section 1.304(a) states that the provisions of andSection;andSection;1.136 and 1.550(c) are not available to extend the time to initiate judicialreview. Sections 1.136(a), 1.136(b), 1.191(d), 1.550(c), 1.645(a) and (b)refer to andSection; 1.304 for extensions of time for seeking judicial reviewafter a decision has been entered. Section 1.645(a) has been amended by(1) adding the introductory phrase ``Except to extend the time for filinga notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuitor for commencing a civil action,'' to the first sentence and (2) deletingthe references to filing a notice of appeal or commencing a civil actionin the second sentence. In view of the amendments to andSection;andSection; 1.197 and 1.304, relatingto extensions of time to seek reconsideration or initiate judicial review,andSection; 1.191(d) does not refer to andSection;andSection; 1.196 and 1.197.<ITAG tagnum="81">(6) Miscellaneous Amendments </ITAG>In the past, appellants could use fee extensions to delay the time forrequesting an oral hearing at the BPAI. This delayed final dispositionof the appeal and causes administrative problems and duplication of effortdue to the transfer of the appeal to the hearing docket. Section 1.191(d)no longer refers to andSection; 1.194. Fee extensions are no longer availableto extend the time for requesting an oral hearing. Extensions under andSection;1.136(b) are available to extend the time to request an oral hearing.Section 1.191(b) has been rewritten as one sentence without any changein substance. Some confusion has resulted as to who has jurisdiction over a patent applicationafter a notice of appeal to the BPAI has been filed. Problems arose, forexample, as to the appropriate PTO official to decide certain petitionsand other matters after an appeal has been filed. MPEP section 1210 indicatesthat jurisdiction over the application normally passes at one of five possibletimes listed therein. Section 1.191 includes a new section (e) which providesthat jurisdiction transfer to the BPAI when the application or reexaminationfile including all briefs and examiner's answers is transmitted to theBPAI. Thus, jurisdiction transfers to the BPAI when all written submissionsby the applicant and the examiner have been entered and the applicationpapers have been forwarded to the BPAI.New andSection; 1.191(e) also includes a provision that the Commissioner,prior to the time the BPAI renders its decision, may <T3>sua sponte</T3> order that an application be remanded to the examinerfor further consideration. This provision merely makes explicit the inherentauthority of the Commissioner to direct and supervise the examination ofpatent applications.Under previous rules there was some confusion as to when ``terminationof proceedings'' occurs. Section 1.197(c) provides that proceedings are``terminated'' when the Federal Circuit's mandate is received by the PTOor after the time for appeal from the judgment of the district court ina civil action under 35 U.S.C. 145 has expired. The language ``In suchcases,'' in the second sentence of former andSection; 1.197(c) has been eliminatedsince it was superfluous and may have been confusing.The rules delete the phrase ``that he or she elects'' and substitutes ``electing''therefor in andSection;andSection; 1.304(c) and 2.145(c)(3), as amended. Theamendment merely changes wording without any change in substance. Section 1.196(b) changes the verb ``make'' to ``makes'' to conform theverb to the singular subject of the sentence. Sections 1.301, 1.303, 2.145(a)(2) and 2.145(c)(3) no longer refer to transmittalof the certified list and certified copies of the notice of election tothe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit under 35 U.S.C. 141 or15 U.S.C. 1071(a)(1). These procedures are required by applicable statutesor Court Rules and are unnecessary in the PTO's regulations. Sections 1.304(a), 1.304(c), 2.145(c)(3) and 2.145(d)(1) include a statementthat the certificate of mailing provisions of andSection; 1.8 are <T3>not</T3> applicable. No substantive change is involved since the inapplicabilityof andSection; 1.8 is already stated in andSection; 1.8(a)(2)(viii) and (ix).Sections 1.304(b) and 2.145(d)(2) recite ``Federal holiday in the Districtof Columbia'' rather than ``legal holiday.'' These changes merely conformthe language of these sections with the language of 35 U.S.C. 21(b) and37 CFR 1.7. Section 2.145(c)(2) and (3) include changes in wording without any changein substance. <ITAG tagnum="84">Other Considerations </ITAG>These rules will not have a significant impact on the quality of the humanenvironment or the conservation of energy resources. The rule change is in conformity with the requirements of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354), Executive Orders 12291 and 12612, andthe Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 350 et seq. The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified to theChief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration that the rulechange will not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities (Regulatory Flexibility Act, Pub. L. 96-354).The rule change requiring appellants to request reconsideration under thespecific circumstances set forth is not expected to result in an increaseof fees charged by attorneys and agents to entities, including small entities,since the rule change is intended to eliminate erroneous grounds for rejectionprior to appeal and in some instances is expected to eliminate the needfor appeal. The Patent and Trademark Office has determined that this rule change isnot a major rule under Executive Order 12291. The annual effect to theeconomy will be less than $100 million. There will be no major increasein costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, federal, stateor local government agencies, or geographic regions. There will be no significantadverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets.The PTO has also determined that this notice has no Federalism implicationsaffecting the relationship between the national government and the statesas outlined in Executive Order 12612. The rule change will not impose a burden under the Paperwork ReductionAct of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., since no record keeping or reportingrequirements within the coverage of the Act are placed upon the public.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>37 CFR Part 1 Administrative practice and procedure, Courts, Freedom of information,Inventions and patents, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Smallbusinesses.37 CFR Part 2 Administrative practice and procedure, Courts, Lawyers, Trademarks.For the reasons given in the preamble and pursuant to the authority grantedto the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks by 35 U.S.C. 6, Parts 1 and2 of Title 37 of the Code of Federal Regulations are amended as set forthbelow. <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1_RULES OF PRACTICE IN PATENT CASES </ITAG>1.

The date on which the response,the petition, and the fee have been filed is the date of the response andalso the date for purposes of determining the period of extension and thecorresponding amount of the fee. The expiration of the time period is determinedby the amount of the fee paid. In no case may an applicant respond laterthan the maximum time period set by statute, or be granted an extensionof time under paragraph (b) of this section when the provisions of thisparagraph are available.
