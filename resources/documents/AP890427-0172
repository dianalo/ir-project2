Navy officials have told Congress they want a force of at least20 Trident submarines equipped with a high number of missile tubes_ 24 _ rather than more submarines with fewer tubes.   In the letter, the lawmakers asked for a better plan ``in orderto maintain a robust naval strategic fleet _ and strengthen ourcurrent arms control negotiating posture.''   ``Under the scenarios proposed to Congress, the Navy wouldretain over 4,000 strategic warheads,'' the lawmakers said.``However, the proposals _ or the Trident's missile tubeconfiguration _ may need to be revised.''   Former President Reagan and Soviet President Mikhail S.Gorbachev agreed to limit each country to 4,900 ballistic missilewarheads. Under a U.S.-Soviet strategic arms reduction treaty, theNavy plan would leave fewer than 900 warheads for land-basedmissiles, the lawmakers said.   ``If we continue to procure one Trident per year, as currentlyconfigured, we may end up buying Tridents in excess of those wewould deploy under START,'' the letter also says. ``This may forcepremature retirements of one or more Tridents _ forfeiting amultibillion-dollar expenditure.''   Among the possible options, the letter suggests, is redesign ofthe Trident to carry fewer missile tubes, research on a smallerstrategic submarine or slowing down production of the Trident.   ``I am concerned that the Navy may be going down a blind alleywith its strategic modernization plan,'' said Rep. Tom Foglietta,D-Pa., one of the signees of the letter. ``It appears incompatiblewith the current arms control framework.''   Rep. Charles Bennett, D-Fla., chairman of the House ArmedServices seapower subcommittee, raised the issue with the deputychief of naval operations for plans, policy and operations at acongressional hearing.   Vice Adm. Charles R. Larson said the Trident gives the Navy thenecessary flexibility and survivability, and another witness _Robert G. Joseph, deputy assistant secretary of defense for nuclearforces and arms control policy _ cautioned against strategy basedon a U.S.-Soviet treaty.   ``The last thing we want to do now is act as if we have anagreement in START,'' Joseph said.   In addition to Foglietta, the House members who signed theletter were Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the Armed ServicesCommittee; John M. Spratt, D-S.C., Ronald Dellums, D-Calif.;Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass.; Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.; Albert G.Bustamante, D-Texas; and Martin Olav Sabo, D-Minn.</TEXT></DOC>
