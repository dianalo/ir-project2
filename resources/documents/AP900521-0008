But backers hope it will lead to a national network ofchild-oriented radio stations, and others say the market is ripefor such programming.   ``Radio can be the storyteller that too often is missing from achild's life. It makes you think,'' said Peggy Charren, presidentof Action for Children's Television, a vigorous promoter ofchildren's radio programming.   WWTC-AM, or Radio Aahs (pronounced Oz), made its debut May 12with a broadcast from St. Paul's Como Zoo. So far, WWTC is the onlystation in the Children's Radio Network.   Two other radio networks for children are breaking ground inOrlando, Fla., and Philadelphia.   Radio Aahs airs educational songs, school news, fairy tales,historical stories and re-creations of such old-time radio shows asthe ``Lone Ranger'' around the clock.   ``It's pretty nice,'' said 5-year-old Gary Petersen. ``I don'tlike rock 'n' roll stations. My mom turns it up too loud.''   His mother, Patricia, is glad Gary and his 3-year-old brother,Jarrod, feel a part of things. ``Mom has her radio station, Dad hashis radio station, and now they have theirs,'' she said.   Emily Semsch, 6, likes that the station ``has more kid songs.There's a song from school I know.''   William Osewalt, president of Children's Radio Network, believesthat engaging the community is the key to the commercial venture'ssuccess. He's thinking of children as guest DJs, broadcastperformances by school choirs and bands, and radio plays. Juniorjournalists could also report on activities in their schools.   ``There also will be the ones who go out and interview theHerschel Walkers, other Vikings, the governor and the senators andfind out how legislation will affect them,'' Osewalt said.   Osewalt formed Children's Radio Network in 1984, sellingprogramming to six stations around the country before getting outof the business in 1986 for personal reasons.   When he was ready to resume, he targeted the Twin Cities. Amongthe reasons are its high per-capita spending on education and itsreputation as a traditional family base, he said.   ``Like they say in show biz, if it doesn't work here, it won'twork anywhere,'' Osewalt said.   The station has started with about 20 full-time employees, plusvolunteer advisers, such as St. Paul School Superintendent DavidBennett.   Osewalt would not disclose the network's budget.   Radio Aahs is a ``very nice alternative in a child's mediadiet,'' said Richard Weinberg, director of the University ofMinnesota's Institute of Child Development in the College ofEducation. ``Our kids live so much in a visual world. Returning toan auditory world allows them to enhance their own imaginations.''   In Florida, Kids' Choice Broadcasting Network has begunmarketing its network of satellite-delivered programs. Orlandostation WPRD-AM is the flagship station for the network, havinglaunched the children's format March 31.   Kidwaves Radio Network of Philadelphia plans to launch itsall-children's programming June 1 at KIDZ-AM in Kansas City, Mo.,said network President Mel Diamond.   ``I think for the first time radio people are just waking up tothis segment,'' Diamond said. ``Our goal here at this network is toraise their imagination levels, their creativity, and to ensure wehave a literate America.''   The notion of an all-children's format on radio tantalizes L.Roger Casty, executive vice president of CPM Inc., a Chicago mediamanagement company that finds media for advertisers and agencies.   ``It sounds like a wonderful idea. If I were the advertiser, Iwould certainly look into it. It may be a very efficient way togo,'' Casty said.</TEXT></DOC>
