(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Where there's no smoke, there's ire _particularly when a public university in this tobacco-growing statetries to limit smoking.   Members of the Legislature's Tobacco Task Force raised thethreat of reprisals Monday against the University of Louisvilleover a policy that took effect March 1 limiting smoking todesignated areas in 100 campus buildings.   ``We've got basically some people that are wanting to bite thehand that feeds them,'' said Sen. John Rogers.   The task force ordered a study of tobacco's contribution to theKentucky treasury and the size of the University of Louisville'sshare. The Legislature convenes in 1990 to write the budget forhigher education through 1992.   Rep. Clay Crupper, who called for the study, said histobacco-growing constituents were angry about a state institution'simplied hostility toward tobacco.   ``They pay a lot of taxes,'' said Crupper, chairman of the HouseAgriculture Committee. ``I've got letter after letter, `Whateveryou do, don't let them have any of our tax dollars from tobaccobecause they don't deserve it.'''   Dan Hall, special assistant to university President DonaldSwain, and Larry Owsley, university vice president foradministration, said the policy was not a slap at tobacco growersor discrimination against employees who smoke.   ``We're not on any crusade. We are in this to try to regulate asituation in a working environment,'' Owsley said.   But the task force was unmoved.   ``You folks remind me a lot of a teen-ager who needs money, butyou're somewhat embarrassed about your parents,'' Rogers said. ``Ifsomething happens that the money ... you want is not forthcoming,then I think that you're going to have to bear a part of theburden.''   The senator said the smoking restrictions should be scrapped.   ``If you've got a few people that are squealing because theydon't like the smoke, which do they like the best or the least? Thesmoke or the paycheck? Because tobacco is very instrumental inpaying their salaries,'' Rogers said.</TEXT></DOC>
