(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The PTL trustee plans to hold severalauctions this month to sell silver coins, stamps and othervaluables found in a vault at PTL headquarters.   The sale comes as a Canadian real estate executive says he plansto pursue his offer to pay $113 million for Heritage USA andoperate it as a theme park with no religious overtones.   Trustee M.C. Benton said the auctions would be Friday, Saturdayand Aug. 12 at the Heritage Grand Hotel.   Although the collection had been in the vault for some time,Benton first saw the inside of the vault July 25. Benton said helooked after deciding to sell assets to raise money for thefinancially troubled ministry and Christian retreat.   ``I started the program of auctioning things we don't needseveral weeks ago. The things in this vault are another part ofthat program,'' Benton said.   An appraiser has not completed evaluating the collection.   Benton said the use of any money raised would be determined byU.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds.   PTL filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 ofbankruptcy laws more than a year ago. It owes creditors anestimated $130 million.   The 15-by-16-foot vault contains small bars of 99.9 percent puresilver, a rack of fur coats, small statuettes of various metals andold money and stamps.   Benton said other items that will be auctioned include pieces ofheavy equipment Heritage USA no longer uses and automobiles donatedto the ministry.   Canadian real estate executive Peter Thomas says Benton is readyto work with him, according to the Vancouver Sun.   Thomas, majority stockholder in Century 21 of Canada, told thenewspaper, ``I believe now they'll give it (Heritage USA) to me.''   Thomas, 49, was born in London and grew up the Canadian provinceof Alberta.   In recent weeks, PTL founder Jim Bakker, who was forced from theministry in a sex and money scandal, has said he wants to buy backPTL's assets and return as its leader. Also in the bidding isCharlotte, N.C., sports executive George Shinn, who has said hewants to build a sports complex adjoining Heritage USA.</TEXT></DOC>
