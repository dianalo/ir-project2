Julie Guptill-Gilbert, formerly a Montessori teacher, pleadedguilty in March to two counts of communicating with minors forimmoral purposes, both involving 4-year-old girls. She originallyhad been charged with statutory rape in one case and indecentliberties in the other.   Judge Warren Chan gave her a choice of 30 days in jail or 60days wearing the sign, and she chose the latter.   Therefore, the 19-year-old woman must return from California,where officials said they would be unable to supervise her, andwear the sign in the Seattle area, Chan said Monday.   The sign must say something like ``I am a child molester,'' hesaid.   Chan agreed to delay the date of his order until Sept. 1, a fewweeks after Ms. Guptill-Gilbert is to give birth, but he refused tolift the order outright.   Michael Frost, her attorney, asked that the sentence be changedto 60 days of ``house arrest.''   ``If the purpose was for Ms. Gilbert to suffer some humiliationwhen she went in public, I would submit she has suffered that ahundred times over with the publicity,'' Frost said.   Chan said the purpose of the sign was to protect the public.   In neighboring Oregon, District Judge Dorothy M. Baker last yearordered Richard J. Bateman, 47, of Portland to post signs on hishouse and car saying, ``Dangerous Sex Offender, No ChildrenAllowed.'' The signs were a requirement of his probation. He hadpleaded no contest to molesting two children.   When a probation officer reported the sign on Bateman's housewas obscured, the judge scheduled a probation revocation hearing.Bateman failed to show up. Three weeks later, a tip led to hisarrest and the judge resentenced Bateman on Feb. 10 to the maximum10 years in prison for violating the terms of his probation.</TEXT></DOC>
