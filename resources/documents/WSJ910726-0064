Mario Cuomo of NewYork stands the best chance to captivate U.S. voters, TheWall Street Journal's panel of political experts agree.   &quot;At least he's life-sized,&quot; says Republican strategistJohn Sears.</LP><TEXT>   Voters react to politicians &quot;viscerally,&quot; says Democraticconsultant Greg Schneiders, and it helps that &quot;Cuomo has coreconvictions that are palpable. We don't have that in ourother candidates.&quot;   The Democrats' only hope in next year's presidentialcontest, the panelists say, is to hit President Bush hard ondomestic policy, an area he has neglected in favor of foreignpolicy. &quot;Foreign policy may be George Bush's steroids,&quot; saysMr. Schneiders. &quot;It may mask some serious underlying domesticproblems that will only get worse, untended.&quot;   What the Democrats should do, panelists suggest, is torecapture some of the spirit of Andrew Jackson and HarryTruman, their great give-'em-hell populist presidents. Butthe panelists aren't sure that any of the potentialcandidates, even Mr. Cuomo, could satisfactorily make a caseagainst Mr. Bush in that spirit. And the party itself, thepanelists say, wobbles between paying homage to its mostliberal firebrands at the same time some of its congressionalleaders are trying to reach compromises with a conservativeWhite House.   The two other members of the panel, Democratic strategistAlan Baron and GOP theoretician Kevin Phillips, agree thatMr. Cuomo might run the strongest race. But they point to theproblems even he would encounter.   Mr. Phillips believes a Cuomo candidacy would be hurt byhis early opposition to the war in the Persian Gulf, by thedeteriorating fiscal situation in New York and,&quot;unfortunately, by the fact that his name ends in a vowel.&quot;Mr. Baron agrees, emphasizing the budget woes in New York. &quot;Idon't think we'll hear him bragging about the `New YorkMiracle,'&quot; he says, harkening back to 1988 nominee MichaelDukakis's use of the short-lived &quot;Massachusetts Miracle&quot; as acenterpiece of his campaign.   Even so, Mr. Sears believes &quot;Cuomo is the Democrats'strongest candidate. He'd have more leeway in dealing withhis party's special interests, and he can talk to the middleclass and ethnic Americans about what's wrong with thecountry. Then, too, he'd take on, with relish, the task ofunseating George Bush.&quot;   Most voters, the panelists generally agree, would acceptMr. Cuomo as a politician of sufficient stature that theycould visualize him sitting down next to a Mikhail Gorbachevor a Francois Mitterrand. But in a burst of candor, all fourpanelists readily admit they haven't the slightest ideawhether Mr. Cuomo will run for president.   Sen. John D. Rockefeller of West Virginia emerged as themost intriguing of the anyone-but-Cuomo lot. &quot;At least he'dspook George Bush,&quot; says Mr. Phillips. &quot;Rockefeller is hisown kind,&quot; only more so: His wealth and social status farexceed the president's own blue-blood background.   &quot;Nice name, lots of money,&quot; says Mr. Sears about Mr.Rockefeller, &quot;but I'm afraid the more people saw of him, theless they'd like him.&quot; Mr. Schneiders says he had &quot;highhopes&quot; at one time for Mr. Rockefeller, but feels he's&quot;missing the point&quot; in proposing a $1,000 tax credit toparents for each child up to the age of 18 and in hisemphasis on helping Americans who carry no health insurance.   The panelists give Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa credit forstirring some interest among the party faithful and concedethat he should do well in the early-bird contests in Iowa andNew Hampshire. But Mr. Schneiders says Mr. Harkin reminds himof former Sen. Fred Harris of Oklahoma, whose fiery speechesdrew cheers from the same sort of party activists in 1976 butwhose candidacy went nowhere.   Sen. Albert Gore of Tennessee, panel members say, couldrun a stronger race this time than four years ago. But somesuggest that memories of Jimmy Carter's troubled presidencyremain so strong that the country isn't ready to accept theidea of another Southern Democrat for president. The samelogic applies to Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas.   The panelists don't take seriously the candidacy of formerSen. Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, and they doubt that theRev. Jesse Jackson will be a dominant factor should he chooseto run a third time.   The Democrats' problems, the panelists say, are deeplyingrained and go beyond the weakness of the individualsseeking to run for president. Democrats as a party &quot;mustovercome their civic-nerd liberalism,&quot; says Mr. Phillips.&quot;They need some kind of hormone transfusion.&quot;   &quot;They should stick to basic domestic populism,&quot; says Mr.Sears. &quot;But they're afraid of the activists in their ownparty, who are farther to the left than they are. They'reafraid to speak to the majority of their own constituents.&quot;   Mr. Baron worries that, &quot;until they figure out they're theopposition party,&quot; they don't have much chance. &quot;The problemis, most Democrats in Congress think they're better off witha Republican president.&quot;   Mr. Phillips says that situation is personified by DanRostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who heads the House Waysand Means Committee. &quot;Rosty is a built-in emasculation kitfor the Democrats,&quot; says Mr. Phillips. &quot;He's his party'sAchilles' heel, a man who believes the measure of his successis the degree to which he colluded with the Republicans.&quot;   The fact that U.S. voters now tend to accept, and evenlike, the notion of government divided between the twoparties is yet another problem for the Democrats. If theytook control of the White House, they would be in charge ofalmost everything in the country -- the presidency, theCongress, most of the governors, most of the statelegislatures. &quot;It would be like coming up with threesquirrels on a slot machine,&quot; says Mr. Phillips. &quot;It meansthe Democrats have a presumption to overcome&quot; in thepresidential campaign.   To have a shot at success, the panelists say, theDemocrats must stay away as much as possible from debatingMr. Bush on foreign policy. Mr. Schneiders's advice: &quot;Changethe subject.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
