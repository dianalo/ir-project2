The agency, monitored in Nicosia, said six targets in the Ahwazoilfields in southwestern Khuzestan province were hit and caughtfire.   Soon after, two installations at the Bibi Hakimah oilfield, 120miles to the southeast were bombed and set ablaze, INA reported.   Another formation of jets hit the Kagsaran terminal on thenorthern coast of the Persian Gulf at about the same time, leavingthe targets shrouded in flames and smoke, the agency said.   All the planes returned safely to their bases, INA added.   There was no immediate comment from Tehran and the Iraqi claimscould not be independently confirmed.   INA quoted a military communique as saying the raids were amessage to Tehran that ``it has lost the war in all fields and thatthere is no alternative to save Iran from total deterioration butto accept peace.''   Today's air raids were the first significant strikes againstIranian oil installations on land since early May, whenfighter-bombers attacked several oil refineries and petrochemicalplants.   The air force has also attacked several Iranian oil tankers inthe gulf a bit to choke off the vital oil exports Tehran needs tofinance its war effort.   French-built Iraqi Mirage F-1s carried out a long-range1,500-mile raid on Iran's Larak Island oil terminal in the southerngulf on May 14, setting five tankers on fire.   The targets included the world's largest vessel, the 564,739-tonSeawise Giant.   Iraqi air strikes inflicted considerable damage on Iran's oilinfrastructure in March and April, oil industry and diplomaticsources reported. Refineries were repeatedly hit.   Oil industry sources say Iran has been forced to importunprecedented amounts of refined products, such as aviation fueland kerosene, because refinery production has been badly reduced.   Iraq's air force has been concentrating on attacking Iraniantroop concentrations in the last few weeks as the land war heatedup.   Both sides have claimed to have killed or wounded thousands ofeach other's troops in various sectors of the 730-mile front.   Iran and Iraq have been at war since September 1980.</TEXT></DOC>
