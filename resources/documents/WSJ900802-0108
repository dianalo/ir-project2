Other U.S. officials saidtens of thousands of Liberians have sought sanctuary inchurches and near U.S. installations in the capital, aspatrols from government troops and two rebel factions stagesporadic fighting in downtown Monrovia.   As many as 600 Liberians were slaughtered in a Monroviachurch on Sunday. Most of the victims are believed to havebeen members of the Gio and Mano tribes, which are involvedin the rebel forces. According to Mr. Boucher, the U.S. haseyewitness accounts that they were shot by soldiers ofPresident Samuel Doe, who is holed up in his fortifiedheadquarters in Monrovia, protected by an elite cadre oftroops. Mr. Doe and most of his troops are members of theKrahn tribe.   The fighting began in December, when rebel troops enteredLiberia from the north. Since then they have split into tworival factions, the largest of which is led by CharlesTaylor, formerly the head of the government's purchasingagency. Mr. Taylor's forces, according to one U.S. official,are believed to include troops who have received training andweapons from Libya.   As the two rebel factions converged on Monrovia, the U.S.evacuated hundreds of Americans from the country, which has apopulation of 1.5 million. About 400 Americans remain,according to the State Department, and a Marine Corps taskforce has been positioned offshore in case a furtherevacuation is needed. So far, according to the StateDepartment, there have been no attacks on embassies inMonrovia, although some of the firefights have occurred inthe embassy district.</TEXT></DOC>
