In order to simulate the conditionsin heavily insulated buildings group 1 was exposed to nitrogen dioxide(0.1 ppm), carbon dioxide (0.2% by volume), and carbon monoxide (20 ppm)together with breathable textile dusts. Conditions in non-ventilatednew buildings were simulated adding a mixture of 20 different volatileorganic substances typical of the indoor air (8.5 mg/m/sup 3/) for group2 to inhale. Twice a day an hour group 3 was exposed to skillet smels(roast meat and fried fish, 20 mg/m/sup 3/) to assess the potential hazardsof kitchens. An equally large group of experimental rats was kept infiltered fresh air for comparative purposes. Over a period of two monthsafter exposure half of the rats of each group were kept in fresh airto assess possible biological regenerations. After an inhalation periodof 28 days routine hematological and clinico-chemical tests (blood andurine) proved the rats exposed to be suffering from a number of subclinicaleffects. Sensitive measuring methods applied to test pulmonary irritationand genotoxicity succeeded in differentiating between reversible andirreversible effects.</TEXT></DOC>
