Since theintroduction of these early systems there have been many improvementsin both the hardware and the software used for this important diagnosticprocedure. Also, improvements have been made in the clinical applicationsand diagnostic protocols which are followed by the clinicians using thetechnological capabilities of DSA. Hardware changes have provided increasedspatial resolution, increased field-of-view, more rapid imaging rates,the potential and realization of tomographic imaging, simultaneous biplaneimaging, and procedure automation. Software changes have produced a varietyof analysis techniques for organ function information (particularly cardiacfunction), image enhancement, and image motion correction. Clinical procedureshave become much more standardized and clinical experience has uncoverednew and novel areas of application demonstrated in this text. The authorsfirst discuss the components of these systems to place the advances andareas of research and potential research in an overall context.</TEXT></DOC>
