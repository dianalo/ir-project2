Saddamdropped out of law school at the University of Cairo, butseveral years later showed up for the bar exam in Baghdad. Hecame prepared -- with a revolver in his belt and four armedbodyguards at his side. Having thus satisfied the barexaminers, lawyer Saddam left the building without having totake the test.   This respect for law means threats of war-crimes tribunalsfrom pin-striped lawyers in Washington or Geneva probablywon't faze Saddam. The occasional rattling of the war-crimessword might, however, encourage other Iraqis to think twiceabout abusing POWs. And a war-crimes end game might alsooffer a way to punish Saddam if he survives the war. It'simportant to keep in mind, however, that it's a sign of thequasi-legal nature of a war-crimes tribunal that the worldwill get a trial only through military might.</LP><TEXT>   Defense Department lawyers are busy drafting the bill ofparticulars against Saddam. The indictment so far couldinclude torturing and raping Kuwaitis, taking hostages,bombing nonbelligerents in Israel and civilians in SaudiArabia, beating and displaying POWs on television then usingthem as &quot;human shields,&quot; dumping the Saddam Slick andarranging terrorist bombings in Turkey, the Philippines,Greece and Lebanon.   Iraq signed the Geneva Convention, but has apparentlyviolated each of its 143 articles. Article 13 says POWs &quot;mustat all times be treated humanely&quot; and &quot;protected,particularly against acts of violence or intimidation andagainst insults and public curiosity.&quot; Article 14 says POWsare &quot;entitled in all circumstances to respect for theirpersons and their honor.&quot; Article 17 says &quot;no physical ormental torture, nor any other form of coercion.&quot; Article 23says POWs must not be located in places &quot;to render certainpoints or areas immune from military operations.&quot;   Defining the crimes is easier than apprehending thecriminals, of course. President Bush says that &quot;theviolations of the Geneva Conventions are clear,&quot; but alsothat &quot;we'll have to see how that works out, and have to seewhat a post-liberation Kuwait looks like.&quot; A trial ispossible, but not yet a condition for ending the war.   If there is a trial, justice might be best served if it isconducted under rules other than our own. We should notpretend that any such trial, no matter how well justified,can rise to the level of a &quot;legal&quot; proceeding akin to atypical U.S. criminal trial. There are too many legalirregularities accepted by &quot;international law&quot; to try to fita war-crimes trial into our system without corrupting U.S.courts.   For example, the Geneva Convention does not provideparticular judges to enforce its rules, so any court would bemade up as we went along. The Nuremberg trials passed lightlyover U.S. constitutional protections such as prohibitions onex post facto laws or the vague &quot;crimes against humanity.&quot; Soany war-crimes trial would have more to do with the spoils ofwar than with the rule of law. This is why we had war trialsafter World War II, but not after Korea or Vietnam.   There is also a practical reason to keep war trials out ofU.S. courtrooms. If there is an international tribunal, therewill be no legal reason to give Saddam the full array of U.S.constitutional protections. Good thing, too: The last timeU.S. courts tried an Arab terrorist, he nearly got off onthat most familiar technicality, Miranda.   In 1987, the FBI arrested a former Lebanese Amalmilitiaman, Fawaz Yunis, off the waters of Cyprus. During histrip to Washington on a naval warship, Yunis confessed tohijacking a plane, but federal Judge Barrington Parkerquashed evidence of the confession.   Judge Parker wrote that the Arabic translation of theMiranda warning &quot;had been copied out incorrectly leaving outseveral crucial words and letters.&quot; Although the FBI agentsand translators testified that Yunis understood well enough,Judge Parker disagreed. &quot;Yunis, however, was not an Americancitizen and was not conversant with Miranda. As a Lebanesecitizen, he did not grow up watching `Hawaii Five-O' or`Matlock' and had nothing in his day-to-day experience todraw upon.&quot; Judge Parker also said that Yunis was injuredduring his arrest, seasick and kept in an &quot;overheated smallroom.&quot;   The federal appeals court in Washington overruled JudgeParker to allow the confession, but the case shows how trickyMiranda might be in any arrest of Saddam. Judge Abner Mikva,perhaps playing the straight man to the looniness of Miranda,wrote that &quot;the three instances of faulty orthography&quot; werenot serious enough to quash the confession:   &quot;First the Arabic version of the word `from' was in oneinstance missing a circle at its beginning, which should havebeen part of the word's first letter. (The word appeared inthis sentence: `You have the right to stop from answering atany time.') Secondly, the Arabic word for the word `what,'which is normally written with a vertical line that makes aloop to the right at the bottom,&quot; Judge Mikva wrote, &quot;did notcontain the loop in one instance. The word, which thus lackedone of its two letters, appeared in the sentence, `I know, Iunderstand what I am doing.' Finally, a word that means`against me' or `to me' lacked one of its three letters whenit was written in this sentence, `No threats or any pressureof any kind were given to me, were directed to me.' Asincorrectly written, the word `to me' resembled the Arabicword for `always,' but only when viewed in isolation from thesurrounding text.&quot;   One way to avoid complications from any war-crimes trialwherever it's held is to make one unnecessary. There is someconfusion, however, over whether it would be somehow illegalfor the U.S. to be involved in any action that led toSaddam's death. The debate surrounds Executive Order 12333,which prohibits &quot;assassination&quot; of foreign leaders. Rep. BobMcEwen (R., Ohio) has introduced a resolution urgingPresident Bush to suspend the order &quot;with respect to theleadership of Iraq.&quot;   Now, there are good reasons not to assassinate heads ofstate, such as that some countries are probably better at itthan the U.S. would be. Assassination, however, refers tokilling for political purpose. The U.S. is now at war withIraq, and attacks on command-and-control facilities formilitary purposes include attacks on commanders andcontrollers. This is not a covert action against SouthVietnam's Diem; it's more like in 1943 when the U.S. shotdown the plane carrying Adm. Isoroku Yamamoto. As formerState Department lawyer Abraham Sofaer said, the laws of warinclude &quot;the right to use lethal force against any person whois a legitimate military target.&quot;   One reason we fight, President Bush says, is to restoreinternational law and order to the Persian Gulf. Time maytell that a war-crimes tribunal will help achieve this goal.Any such trial might not be pretty under U.S. rules of law,but we should make sure it is effective.</TEXT></DOC>
