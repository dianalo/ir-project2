Sales in May rose an average of about 3.5% fromyear-earlier results, falling short of year-to-date gains ofabout 5%. But analysts blamed bad weather in the East andMidwest in the second half of the month, rather than asignificant change in consumer-spending habits, for thedisappointing numbers.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It has been a mediocre environment,&quot; declared EdwardWeller of Montgomery Securities. &quot;Warmer weather in Februaryand March led some observers to believe the underlyingstrength of the consumer was greater than it is. . . . Now itlooks worse because of weather-inhibited sales.&quot;   Mr. Weller added that he expects spending to remain weakbecause of the thrift crisis and sluggish demand for durablegoods.   The unseasonably cold weather hurt May sales of bathingsuits, shorts and other summer clothes as well as lumber,patio and barbecue supplies, gardening equipment and airconditioners, the analysts said.   If the weather doesn't break soon, consumers could findbig bargains. &quot;Markdowns will begin by the third week in Juneif sales trends haven't changed,&quot; predicted Barry Bryant ofPrudential-Bache Securities Inc. Such markdowns would depressretailers' second-quarter profits.   Indeed, some analysts started cutting their Gap Inc.forecasts yesterday, sending the specialty retailer's stocktumbling $4.375 to close at $58.50 in composite trading onthe New York Stock Exchange. Although Gap reported arespectable 6% gain in May sales at stores open at least ayear, the chain had planned for a bigger increase. LimitedInc. shares also fell on news that it posted a 6% gain insame-store sales, closing at $47.375, down $1.875, in BigBoard composite trading. Analysts said investors weredisappointed by soft same-store stores at the company's keyLimited division.   Meanwhile, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., a rapidly growingdiscounter, continued to outpace its rivals with an 11% gainin same-store sales.   Other big retailers didn't fare as well. Sears, Roebuck andamp;Co. and K mart Corp. each said same-store sales rose a meager0.9%. And at J.C. Penney Co., comparable-store sales gainedonly 1%. Dayton Hudson Corp.'s same-store sales rose 4.2%.Its Mervyn's stores and Target discount division more thancompensated for a weather-related 4% decline in same-storesales at its department stores in the upper Midwest.   Same-store sales rose 4% at May Department Stores Co., 3%at Woolworth Corp.'s U.S. divisions and 2.2% at Carter HawleyHale Stores Inc. Mercantile Stores Co. reported a 1% increasein same-store sales, while Hills Department Stores Inc. saidsame-store sales fell 4.1%.   Same-store sales, meanwhile, rose 9.5% at Neiman MarcusGroup Inc., a specialty-store chain with a big presence inthe West, where bad weather wasn't a factor.   ---                    Four-week May period                                                                                                                                  a-'90 sales  '89 sales   b-%                              millions   millions  change                                                                                                          Wal-Mart .................  2,527.0    2,033.0   + 24   c-K mart .................  2,337.3    2,109.7   + 10.8   d-Sears ..................  2,192.8    2,154.1   +  1.8   J.C.
