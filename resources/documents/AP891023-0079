Over national television acting president Matyas Szueroesproclaimed Hungary a republic in a symbolic rejection of communistdominance, and church bells pealed across the country.   ``As of today, our nation's ... name is the Republic ofHungary,'' said Szueroes, after Parliament last week voted tochange the name from ``People's Republic.'' Communists had renamedthe country after assuming power in 1948.   Hoots and whistles greeted Szueroes' call for cooperation withthe Soviet Union. But the crowd, estimated at more than 100,000,cheered and clapped when he urged warmer ties with the UnitedStates.   ``We continue to view the uninterrupted development of our tiesto the Soviet Union as in our nation's interests,'' Szueroes said.``At the same time, we also seek to improve (contacts) with theother superpower, the United States of America.''   A reference to planned democratic elections next year also drewprolonged applause.   ``The Republic of Hungary has become a state governed by law,where the values of ... (Western) democracy and democraticsocialism are equally valid,'' Szueroes said.   Many people sported lapel pins showing the red, white and greenHungarian flag with a jagged hole in the middle, symbolizing thecommunist emblem cut out during the revolt. Others displayedbuttons with the pre-communist coat of arms that was resurrectedbriefly in 1956.   It was one of the largest gatherings since Oct. 23, 1956, whenan estimated 200,000 people marched on Parliament to pressdemocratic demands.   Szueroes' proclamation was a highlight of numerous officiallyorganized events and of rallies staged by the political oppositionto mark the anniversary. It was the latest step in Hungary's rapidtransition from 41 years of communist rule toward a multi-partydemocracy.   In Czechoslovakia, the Slovak Communist Party newspaper Pravdatoday condemned the Hungarian Parliament's reform as ``a politicalcoup d'etat'' turning Hungary into a ``bourgeois-democraticrepublic.''   More than 1,000 people packed the St. Stephen Basilica indowntown Budapest and crowded outside the doors earlier today tohear a Mass and sing hymns for the thousands who fell during therevolt which began Oct. 23.   Mothers paraded young girls, whose hair was festooned withribbons in the red, white and green national colors, and thousandsof flags flapped in the warm breeze throughout the capital. Policepresence was low-key, with the usual sidearms and truncheonsconspicuously absent from the belts of officers.   One year ago, thousands of police moved in to blockdemonstrations of the the anniversary. The 1956 revolt, in which asmany as 32,000 people died, is now considered a popular uprisingafter being condemned as a ``counter-revolution'' abetted fromoverseas by dark imperialist forces.   On that day 33 years ago, mass student demonstrations callingfor greater democracy, a multi-party system and the withdrawal ofSoviet troops quickly escalated into armed clashes with Hungarianand Soviet troops. The revolt ended 12 days later, after Soviettanks rumbled into the Hungarian capital and crushed all resistance.   In the last three historic weeks, the Communist Party wasdismantled and transformed into a Socialist party professingdemocratic ideals and Parliament rewrote the constitution toembrace multi-party democracy ahead of free elections next year.   Premier Miklos Nemeth, in a televised address Sunday evening,said the parliamentary session marked the closing of ``an era inour history.''   He also said Hungarians today would be commemorating the``sacrifices of 33 years ago.'' He said the anniversary was areminder that ``we can never try to erase the past.''   Szueroes today provisionally assumes the powers of the newlyexpanded president until a head of state can be elected eitherlater this year or after next year's parliamentary elections.   The new Socialist Party is espousing democratic ideals, thoughit will continue in power until the parliamentary elections it haspromised to hold by June. The party issued a statement Fridayrejecting the Soviet intervention that crushed the revolt andopposing all external intervention or restrictions of sovereignty.   On June 16, tens of thousands of Hungarians attended the funeralof Imre Nagy, the leader of the 1956 revolt, after the governmentrehabilitated him. He was formally reburied in the same plot wherehis body was dumped in an unmarked grave after his execution forhigh treason in 1958.   Last week, Parliament also summarily exonerated all those triedfor roles in the uprising as well as all those who sufferedreprisals between 1948 and 1962 _ the period now officially termedHungary's Stalinist period.</TEXT></DOC>
