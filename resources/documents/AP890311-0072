They painted a picture of steadily mounting tension in Tibet'scapital and persistent acts of defiance by Buddhist monks and nunswho have initiated most protests since Chinese troops entered Tibetin 1950. The sources' identity and whereabouts cannot be revealedfor fear of reprisals.   Tensions burst last week, they said, when Tibetans tried tocommemorate two anniversaries: a March 5, 1988, clash with policethat left 24 people dead, and a March 10, 1959, uprising againstChinese rule in which hundreds died and Tibet's spiritual andtemporal ruler, the Dalai Lama, fled to India.   The commemorations brought more bloodshed: 16 dead and more than100 wounded by official count, many more by Tibetan count.   Pressure began building shortly after a Dec. 10 clash, whenpolice fired on marchers, killing at least one monk and a Tibetanchild. Twenty days later, students from Tibet University held abrief peaceful march to protest the police action.   On Jan. 3, city education officials said students who even stoodon the sidelines of future protests would be expelled, according toa copy of their order shown to The Associated Press.   Buddhist monks at Lhasa's leading monasteries, meanwhile, decidedto boycott a major prayer festival because Chinese authorities brokea promise to increase the quota of people allowed to become monks.   The official media did not report the boycott. They said thefestival was canceled out of respect for the Panchen Lama, TibetanBuddhism's second-ranking religious leader who died of a heartattack Jan. 28.   The Panchen Lama's death led to new tensions. A rumor begancirculating that the overweight, 50-year-old monk was assassinated,because days before he died he criticized Beijing's policies inTibet. No evidence was produced, but the rumor triggered a smallprotest, Tibetans told an American traveler.   Another rumor said Chinese plans to renovate the Potala in Lhasawere an excuse to destroy part of the revered 17th century building.The huge stone palace on a hill, Lhasa's most prominent feature, wasseat of Tibet's theocratic government. In recent years it has beenturned into a tourist site.   On Feb. 3, monks at Lhasa's Sera Monastery hoisted the bannedsnow lion flag over their buildings, where it flew all morningwithout police action.   Three days later, on Tibetan New Year, Lhasa residents woke tosee the nationalist flag flying over the Jokhang Temple, TibetanBuddhism's most sacred site. Pilgrims tossed white ceremonialscarves to the roof.   ``There must have been hundreds of scarves piled up by midday,''said Steve Marshall, of New Orleans, who witnessed the silentprotest. The flag was taken down in the middle of the night.   Four times in late February and early March, small groups ofmonks and nuns walked around the Jokhang carrying a picture of theDalai Lama or chanting independence slogans.   Tibetan witnesses and one participant said bystanders intervenedseveral times to hustle marchers away before they could be arrested.   But the police also seemed anxious to avoid confrontation.Instead, said one Tibetan, they photographed the marchers in orderto arrest them later. He reported seven arrests.   Advance word about the March 5 protest, circulated amongTibetans, indicated it also was planned as a small-scale event.   The pattern broke when police opened fire.   From then on, the Tibetans' anger turned on anything Chinese.They vandalized their stores and stoned Chinese cyclists.   Still unclear is why police shifted tactics.   Martial law imposed midnight Tuesday remained in force Saturday,with heavily armed soldiers manning checkpoints throughout the city.   More anniversaries are coming. March 17 is the day the Dalai Lamaleft Lhasa for India in 1959. On March 19 and 20, 1959, the Chinesearmy used heavy artillery to suppress the uprising.   Most protests have been the work of individual monasteries. Thereis no evidence of a central resistance organization.   The goals are simple: to express four decades of anger over whatis perceived as alien rule, and possibly win outside support. OneTibetan source said protesters hoped the United Nations would openan inquiry into Chinese human rights policies in the region.   Independence remains a vague concept except among young,Westernized Tibetans in India. None of the Lhasa protesters hasarticulated goals beyond the return of the Dalai Lama.   Even Tibetan college students inside China say they have notconsidered how Tibet would be ruled if it were independent.   ``We can't even talk about independence,'' said a 20-year-oldwoman. ``There are too many Chinese and too few of us. What we wantis for the Chinese to understand our culture and stop discriminatingagainst us. If not, in a short while, there will be no more Tibet.''</TEXT></DOC>
