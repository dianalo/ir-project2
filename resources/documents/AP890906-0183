Tass said a court sitting in Moscow found N. Khudaiberdiev,premier from 1971-84, guilty of taking more than 15,000 rubles inbribes and giving bribes of 50,000 rubles. The ruble figures areequivalent to $23,000 and $80,000 at the official rate of exchange.   Several regional party officials in Uzbekistan have been executedfor corruption since trials began last year.   Testimony linked Khudaiberdiev to a 50,000-ruble bribe given YuriChurbanov, son-in-law of the late President Leonid I. Brezhnev, whowas convicted in December and given a 12-year prison sentence, theofficial news agency reported.   It said the court ordered Khudaiberdiev's property confiscatedand sent him to a strict-regime labor camp.   The defendant was quoted as telling the court bribery had soenveloped the Uzbekistan government and Communist Party thatofficials had to participate ``in order to live and work more orless normally.''   Two prosecutors, Telman Gdlyan and Nikolai Ivanov, became heroesby uncovering the trail of corruption that led from Uzbekistan toBrezhnev's Kremlin, where Churbanov was first deputy interiorminister.   After both were elected to the new parliament this year, however,their tactics came under criticism and they were taken off the case.   Tass said supporters of Gdlyan and Ivanov attendedKhudaiberdiev's trial, and the judge had to caution them to stopinterfering.</TEXT></DOC>
