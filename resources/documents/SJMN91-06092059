Manager Roger Craig said Garrelts will throw on thesideline Tuesday and stay in Arizona while the team goes north for the BayBridge Series.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  GARRELTS TO MISS 1ST SERIESBUT INJURY WON'T PUT PITCHER ON DISABLEDLIST  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  BaseballGiants NotebookMercury News wire services contributed to this report.Chart attached to the end of this article  </MEMO><TEXT>     Craig said Garrelts will throw batting practice at the minor league campThursday and then make at least one start there. If only one start isrequired, Garrelts probably will pitch in the Houston series during theseason-opening trip. If Garrelts needs two practice starts -- and that is thesuggestion of pitching coach Norm Sherry -- then Garrelts probably will missthe first trip entirely.;    &quot;I'll know more Tuesday,&quot; Craig said. &quot;I don'twant to take any chances. I'm definitely not going to pitch him in San Diego.If he throws next Saturday in the minor league camp and that's all he needs,then it probably will work out where he can pitch in Houston.&quot;;    Rather thanplacing Garrelts on the disabled list, Craig said he plans to carry only 24players, one under the limit, for the April 9 opener. Craig will take 30players for the weekend Bay Bridge Series, including non-roster playersDarnell Coles and Jeff Carter.;    For the remaining Cactus League games,Kelly Downs will start today against the A's, followed by Rick Reuschelagainst Milwaukee on Tuesday and Mike LaCoss against Milwaukee on Wednesday.Thursday is a travel day, and Craig said opening-day starter John Burkett willpitch that day in a minor league game before rejoining his teammates in theBay Area.;    Don Robinson probably can be eliminated from the startingpicture, because he threw only two innings of relief Sunday.;  ETC.: Firstbaseman Will Clark doubled and singled for the Giants' only hits in a 1-0 lossto Chicago, then had to leave the game in the fourth inning when a bad-hopgroundball struck the base of his right thumb. X-rays were negative. TrainerMark Letendre called the injury &quot;a real bad bruise&quot; and said it is beingtreated with anti-inflammatory drugs. Clark's condition will be re-evaluatedtoday. . . . Third baseman Matt Williams returned to the lineup and went 0 for3, hitting a ball to the left-field warning track in his second at-bat. He hadsprained his neck Tuesday in Yuma and missed four games. . . . Infielder TonyPerezchica was placed on waivers for the purpose of giving him hisunconditional release. . . . When asked for his autograph before the game,Clark told the horde, &quot;It's Easter Sunday -- I'm taking the day off.&quot; Cubsbroadcaster and ex-teammate Bob Brenly told him: &quot;Yeah, I bet you shot theEaster Bunny, too.&quot;; SAN FRANCISCO        CHICAGO;              ab r h bi              ab r h bi; Thompson 2b   3 0 0 0   Walton cf     4 0 2 0; Carter 2b    1 0 0 0   Sandberg 2b   3 1 1 1; McGee cf      4 0 0 0   Walker 2b     1 0 00; Clark 1b      2 0 2 0   Grace 1b      3 0 1 0; Litton 1b     2 0 0 0   Belllf       3 0 0 0; Mitchell lf   4 0 0 0   Carter lf     1 0 0 0; Williams 3b  3 0 0 0   Dawson rf     3 0 1 0; Anderson 3b   0 0 0 0   Vizcain ss    0 0 00; Bass rf       3 0 0 0   Bryhil c      2 0 0 0; Robinson p    0 0 0 0  Dunston ss    3 0 1 0; Decker c      2 0 0 0   Williams p    0 0 0 0; Benjaminss   2 0 0 0   Assenmachr p  0 0 0 0; Black p       1 0 0 0   Scott 3b      30 0 0; Leonard rf    1 0 0 0   Jackson p     2 0 0 0;                        DwSmth rf     1 0 0 0; Totals       28 0 2 0   Totals       29 1 6 1; ...; SanFrancisco                  000 000 000 -- 0; Chicago (N)                   000 001 00x -- 1; ...;       E -- Vizcaino, Walker.
