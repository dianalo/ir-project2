Cargill, astandards theorist at Digital Equipment, vice chairman of the AmericanNational Standards Institute's (ANSI) X3 Planning Committee and author ofInformation Technology Standardization, says the formula is relativelysimple.andM;&quot;Individuals--whether separately or collectively--accept and use standardsonly if they believe that standards offer a benefit,&quot; he says.andP;  Vendors mustbelieve they can sell standard products; users must agree that a standardwill help them do business.andP;  User clout is based on this simple proposition:unless users buy into a standard, users won't buy products based on thatstandard.andP;  Heinz Lyklama, chairman of the Technical Steering Committee of theUNIX user group, /usr/group, and senior vice president of INTERACTIVE SystemsCorp. in Santa Monica, Calif., a UNIX software systems house, puts it thisway: &quot;We'd better listen to our users or we won't have any.&quot;andM;Building ConsensusandM;A major builder of consensus is X/Open Co. Ltd. Geoff Morris, president andchief executive of X/Open, which started as an organization of hardwarevendors looking to broaden their sales base by using common, open systems,says, &quot;X/Open is taking organizational steps to position X/Open as a conduitfrom the users to the suppliers.andP;  The suppliers want it to happen.&quot;andP;  X/Openestablished a User Advisory Council in December 1987 and is flirting with theidea of putting users on its board of directors.andP;  In mid-June, X/Open held athree-day Market Requirements Forum in Montreal at which fully half theparticipants were users, among them representatives from Boeing Co. andGeneral Motors Corp. Morris says, &quot;Montreal was an attempt to rank userissues.&quot;andM;On the vendor side, X/Open's place in the future of UNIX was confirmed whenboth UNIX camps, the OSF and the ATandamp;T-backed UNIX International Inc. saidthey'd conform to X/Open's Common Application Environment.andM;Still, users and suppliers have different aims.andP;  &quot;Users tend to be lessfocused on long-term IT standards than they are on the use of standards toprovide solutions for business problems,&quot; says Digital's Cargill.andP;  In otherwords, vendors are concerned with how it works, while users are concernedwith what it does.andM;User clout in standards setting is most visible in communications.andP;  Here, themagic acronym is OSI, the Open Systems Interconnection, a seven-layer modelfor data communications.andP;  The lowest level is the physical link layer; thetop is the applications layer.andP;  Between them are layers dealing with datalinks, network controls, transport, sessions and presentation.andP;  Codified asISO 7948, Open Systems Interconnection, Basic Reference Model, OSI has beenimplemented by other standards specific to one or more of the seven layers.andO;For example, the Ethernet standard 802.3 fulfills the transport layer andpart of the data link layer, as do 802.4, a token bus standard, and 802.5, atoken ring standard.andM;Making OSI a RealityandM;In North America, the organization that is aiming to make sure that OSIbecomes a functioning reality is the Corporation for Open Systems (COS).andO;While COS is vendor dominated, only about a fourth of its voting membersbeing users, the Users Committee, organized in February 1987, made a majorpush this past spring that resulted in the first &quot;COS Marked&quot; products tocome on the market.andP;  The COS Mark program puts COS' seal of approval onproducts, virtually guaranteeing that they fit comfortably and productivelyinto the OSI seven-layer model for communications.andP;  The first three productsare Concord Communications Inc.'s Concord Series 1100 Modular Modem Card(MAPWare), Hewlett-Packard Co.'s OSI Express MAP 3.0 Broadband Link andMotorola Inc.'s MC68824 Token Bus Controller.andM;Leslie Nittiskie, a COS spokeswoman, reports that over the next two years,products meeting the X.400, X.25 and 802.3 standards will be COS marked.andO;&quot;The COS Mark program will cover a broad range of open networkingenvironments including LANs [local area networks], X.25, ISDN [the IntegratedServices Digital Network], MHS [message handling systems] and FTAM [FileTransfer and Management].&quot;andP;  The COS-marked products will also conform to therequirements of the U.S.andP;  government's Government Open SystemsInterconnection Profile (GOSIP), slated to become mandatory for federalgovernment agencies in August 1990.andM;Powerful Vendors, Powerful UsersandM;Bringing together powerful vendors and powerful users, COS also constitutes aforum in which informal user pressure can be brought to bear.andP;  RichardLefcon, assistant vice president at Citibank NA, and parent Citicorp'srepresentative on the COS User Committee, says, &quot;It's a powerful touchstone.andO;I go to COS meetings and, if I want to talk to the head of networking orstandards for just about any major vendor, that person is in the room.&quot;andM;One of the first rumbles of the new user power came when the MAP/TOP UsersGroup set standards for communications on the factory floor and in offices.andO;While MAP/TOP (the Manufacturing Automation Protocol/Technical OfficeProtocol, standards for computer-integrated manufacturing) has had itsproblems, its successes have inspired the founding of the InformationTechnology Requirements Council (ITRC), a Washington, D.C.-based organizationthat, says member Jeffry Alperin, Aetna Life andamp; Casualty's assistant vicepresident for technology planning, &quot;will be the primary vehicle for givingusers a voice in standards setting.&quot;andM;One User Group Reaches OutandM;The ITRC describes itself as &quot;a user membership organization with activeparticipation by government agencies and vendors, whose primary purpose is toestablish forums for bringing diverse user groups together to formulate theirinformation technology requirements.&quot;andM;As well as incorporating the MAP/TOP group, the ITRC's membership currentlyincludes Aetna, Apple Computer Inc., Bechtel National Inc., Boeing ComputerServices, Eastman Kodak Co., General Motors, Hewlett-Packard and Xerox Corp.andO;The president of the ITRC, Gerry Riso, says the council hopes to have 30members by the end of 1989, each of which will pay $ 100,000 a year in dues.andO;But Riso adds, &quot;There is no arithmetical limit on the number of members wecould have.&quot;andP;  At press time, the ITRC was rumored to have landed a majorbanking institution and was seeking to fill out other empty vertical industryslots in its membership.andM;Abroad, two recent decisions, one in Europe, the other in Japan, suggest thatthe growing clout of users is not confined to the United States.andP;  In Europe,at a meeting called Istel '92, the MIS directors of the European Community'sPublic Telephone andamp; Telegraphs--among the biggest users of informationtechnology in Europe--agreed to recommend that all IS items purchased betweennow and 1992 be complaint with X/Open standards.andP;  In Japan, a huge user badlydamaged the chances for a new operating system designed to challenge a defacto standard.andP;  The Japanese government's Center for Educational Computingdecided not to replace MS-DOS with the Japanese-developed Realtime OperatingSystem Nucleus (TRON) as a standard operating system for computing in primaryand secondary schools.andM;One thing is sure.andP;  Serious participation in the standards process can bevery expensive.andP;  One user representative active in COS puts the minimumannual cost at $ 100,000 for a fully participating user.andP;  Assistant professorMichael Spring from the University of Pittsburgh estimates the annual cost ofhaving a representative on an organization that sets or implements standardsto be $ 250,000.andM;First of all, there are dues to pay.andP;  Take the Corporation for Open Systemsas an example.andP;  COS has several membership categories.andP;  It charges mostvendor members between $ 50,000 and $ 200,000 a year; those vendors thatannually sell more than $ 150 million worth of information technologyproducts pay the higher amount.andP;  COS' user members get a bargain, paying $25,000 a year.andP;  And dues are just the beginning, points out Citibank vicepresident and COS user member Lefcon.andP;  &quot;You rent the hotel rooms, and yousupport the effort with work back at the company.&quot;andM;Travel and hotel expenses can soar.andP;  COS holds its bimonthly meetings at itsheadquarters in McLean, Va., and other standards bodies meet across theglobe.andP;  Between September 1988 and July 1989, for example, ANSI's committeeon Telecommunications and Information Exchange Between Systems, SC6, met inOttawa; Copenhagen; Gaithersburg, Md.; Berlin; and Tokyo.andM;Users who are experienced players in the standards process have developedtheir own ways to lower the cost of getting their say.andP;  Aetna's Alperin sayshis company often-chooses to serve on subcommittees that provide advice,rather than on the standards-writing committees themselves.andP;  &quot;Being on thecommittee is very long and difficult work.andP;  We found that providing input andbeing able to comment has been just as useful and more economical.&quot;andP;  Aetnaalso uses the clout it has built up with its vendors.andP;  &quot;We participate withvendors directly, providing them our architectural requirements.&quot;andP;  Then, thevendors use that information when working for various requirements within thestandards-setting bodies.andP;  Alperin cites Kodak and Hewlett-Packard as beingamong the cooperative vendors.andM;The Hard PartandM;The work is hard.andP;  Take File Transfer and Management (FTAM), an OSI standardin the making.andP;  It crossed an important barrier when it was approved by aplenary meeting in Australia of the Consultative Committee on InternationalTelephone and Telegraph (CCITT) in November 1988.andP;  It takes more than 400pages to spell out the specs for this higher level OSI standard.andP;  And FTAM'scomplexity is not unusual.andP;  U. of Pittsburgh's Spring describes the chore ofreading standards specifications as &quot;a nightmare.&quot;andP;  He says his master'sdegree students receive a rude awakening when faced with standards documents.andM;Taking a stand on standards isn't easy.andP;  As Digital's Cargill puts it: &quot;Theability to participate in [setting] external standards is less a function oftechnical ability than it is of endurance.&quot;andP;  But as the standards makers comeover closer to the applications level of a user's business, users have achoice: they can let others shape the play or they can field a user's team inthe important standards bouts to come.andP;  Grueling as it may be, the ITstandards game is like any other game: you can't win it if you aren't in it.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
