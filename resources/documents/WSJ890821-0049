Diagnosis? A classic case of &quot;consolidation.&quot;    Prognosis? Uncertain. A little rest may cure the problem altogether. But there also are some warning signs that suggest that this consolidation could turn into a bad case of &quot;correction.&quot;    Just when it looked like stock prices were poised to shatter the Dow Jones Industrial Average's all-time high two weeks ago, the stock market suddenly took sick. Prices have slipped and volume is ebbing, making many investors uneasy. A look at the ways in which analysts and money managers are reading the stock market's entrails these days might provide some solace -- or add to anxiety.    Whether pessimist or optimist, most analysts expected the upward momentum in stock prices to slow as the Dow Jones Industrial Average approached its record of 2722.42, set Aug. 25, 1987. They just didn't know if would turn into a consolidation, in which prices retreat modestly before resuming an upward trend, or a correction, in which prices drop 5% or more.    One reason to expect a slowdown was that the most recent leg of the rally that began last November was particularly vigorous, driving prices up at a feverish pace.    &quot;There was a 75-point move in a three-week period&quot; in July, says Kenneth Spence, director of the technical analysis group at Salomon Brothers. &quot;You can't keep that kind of momentum up forever.&quot;    Psychology, too, played a role, especially in light of the lofty prices for stocks. &quot;When the market approaches an all-time high, people become a little uneasy about the upside and feel less comfortable chasing strength,&quot; says Carmine Grigoli, chief portfolio strategist at First Boston.    Salomon's Mr. Spence notes that the entire recovery from the October 1987 crash has followed a stair-step pattern, with periodic rallies broken by periods of sluggish trading and moribund price action. The pattern tends to show that as stock market indexes and averages reach levels of 15% to 16% above their 200-day averages, the rallies stall. Two weeks ago, when the current consolidation began, for example, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was about 16% above its 200-day average.    What's encouraging about the stair-step pattern is that during the consolidation phases prices don't drop below a level of about 5% above the 200-day average. Investors see the slowdown and modest price drops as just another buying opportunity and keep pumping money into the stock market.    &quot;What we've seen is that there's a real lack of selling pressure,&quot; says Mr. Spence. &quot;That's been very much the character of the market all through the recovery.&quot;    Taken together, all that spells &quot;bull,&quot; says Mr. Spence. &quot;From a technician's point of view a bull trend is when the market is making a series of higher highs and higher lows and remaining above the long-term moving average. This market is still in a bullish trend.&quot;    External factors also suggest that the current consolidation is merely a pause before stock prices resume their upward move, says First Boston's Mr. Grigoli. Recent economic data show an economy that's expanding modestly while inflation is ebbing. The Federal Reserve, which had been driving interest rates higher until a few months ago, now is being more accommodative, and the prospects of a recession are rapidly fading. &quot;There has been an awful lot of good news lately,&quot; he says, adding that the favorable outlook is drawing increasing numbers of individual and foreign investors into the stock market.    But not all analysts share that optimistic outlook. Michael O'Higgins, an Albany, N.Y., money manager, specializes in buying and selling the 30 stocks that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average. He's found over the years that the behavior of the index and its component stocks provides him with clues about the overall market's direction. In early 1984, for instance, when overall stock prices were declining, he noted that although the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down, 18 of the component stocks were up and only 12 were down. To him, that meant prices were about to turn up overall -- and they did.    Now, he says, the Dow Jones industrials are flashing a warning signal. While the index is approaching its highs, only 13 of the 30 component stocks have made new highs of their own. Worse still, the biggest gainers among the Dow industrials have been so-called defensive stocks that tend to do well in times of economic difficulty. &quot;This is the type of action that precedes every major decline&quot; in stock prices, he says. &quot;We're talking about a basic hidden erosion that's very ominous.&quot;    While Mr. O'Higgins is looking to big stocks for clues about how the current consolidation might turn out, Avner Arbel, a professor of finance at Cornell University, is taking heed of warning signs from stocks with small market capitalizations. In a recent study he found that the prices of many small stocks are unjustifiably high because they fail to reflect the relatively weak earnings that many of these small companies have reported.    Over the past year, Mr. Arbel says, stocks of companies with annual sales of $8 million to $250 million -- the bottom third of his 2,000-company sample -- have gained 14.5% in price, compared with 24% for the very largest stocks in the top third of his sample. Even so, the ratio of prices to per-share earnings for these small stocks is about 20, compared with 13 for the 500 issues in Standard andamp; Poor's index.    &quot;Most investors don't realize that one third of the market is in bad shape fundamentally,&quot; says Mr. Arbel. He thinks small stocks are due for a severe downward adjustment, which would be reflected in broad indexes such as the New York Stock Exchange composite and the Nasdaq composite index.    Moreover, the professor adds, a correction in small stocks would probably forebode a sell-off in the larger stocks. The reason? Many of the small companies are America's creative, high-growth concerns. &quot;They are the future of the market, typically,&quot; says Mr. Arbel.    They are also more sensitive to economic downturns because their earnings bases aren't as diversified as large companies'. Thus small stocks, trailing large stocks in gains, will lead large stocks in declines, Mr. Arbel predicts.    ---   Friday's Market Activity    A recovery in the bond market and a late round of buying tied to the expiration of stock-index futures and options sent stocks higher.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 8.34 points to 2687.97. The market gained 3.98 points for the week, marking its seventh consecutive weekly increase, but the 0.1% gain was the smallest of the seven.    Takeover rumors helped propel the indexes higher. For example, McGraw-Hill jumped 6 to 85 on rumors that Paramount Communications, which failed in a recent attempt to take over Time Inc., has set its sights on acquiring the company. However, observers told The Wall Street Journal late in the day that a bid for McGraw-Hill by Paramount was unlikely.    In early activity, prices fell briefly after the release of the July consumer price report. The consumer price index rose 0.2% in July, as expected. But measured without the volatile food and energy components, prices rose 0.4%. Initially, bonds were sold off on the price report, but then recovered as dealers bought back some of their &quot;short&quot; positions. In a short sale, a borrowed security is sold in a bet that it can be bought back later more cheaply.    About 20% of the day's activity on the New York Stock Exchange took place in the last half-hour of trading, when dealers unleashed a variety of strategies tied to the expiration of the August Major Market Index futures and options, and Standard andamp; Poor's 100-stock options.    The expiration created modest buy order imbalances in big stocks on the New York Stock Exchange. Most of these imbalances were attributed to market-makers in MMI options who were covering their short positions with purchases of stock. In an imbalance, an exchange specialist has an unusual amount of orders on one side of the market that can't immediately be matched.    Big Board volume totaled 145,810,000 shares, in line with the sluggish pace set earlier in the week. Advancers edged out decliners, 776 to 661.    The Dow Jones Transportation Average rose 14.05 to an all-time record of 1442.39, with UAL pacing the advance as it did most of the week.    UAL, the owner of United Airlines, gained 4 5/8 to 271. The bidding war loomed larger with Texas investor Robert Bass and a group consisting of British Airways and Morgan Stanley interested in the company. Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis, the sole bidder for UAL at the moment, said he is ready to determine whether to raise his offer of $275 a share.    In other takeover-related activity, Georgia Gulf jumped 3 1/2 to 54 1/2 as 1.6 million shares changed hands. Dallas investor Harold Simmons, head of a group with a 9.42% stake in the company, said he will now consider seeking control. One of the companies in the group, NL Industries, gained 1 1/8 to 25 3/4.    Maytag rose 1 3/4 to 23 1/4 on 1.8 million shares. Several professional investors who see the company's shares as undervalued have been accumulating the stock, according to Business Week magazine's &quot;Inside Wall Street&quot; column.    C.R. Bard, which stopped shipments of a new catheter product at the request of the Food and Drug Administration, dropped 1 1/2 to 20 on volume of two million shares. The company estimated that the move would lower its 1989 net income 25 cents a share.    Par Pharmaceutical, the target of an FDA investigation, lost 1/2 to 4 7/8. The company suspended distribution of all its generic drugs in tablet and capsule form.    Pacific Telesis Group added 7/8 to 44 5/8, and GTE advanced 1 3/8 to 59 3/4. California regulators recommended a telecommunications &quot;incentive&quot; plan, which would permit the two companies to earn higher profits if they raise productivity 4% a year.    Castle andamp; Cooke dropped 2 3/8 to 40. Drexel Burnham Lambert lowered its investment rating on the stock, citing its view that the price already reflects the company's favorable prospects.    VF Corp. fell 1 5/8 to 36 3/4 following the expiration of its Dutch auction self-tender offer for 10 million common shares, or 14.7% of its shares outstanding. The company said it would pay $38 a share; the price range for the offer had been set at $35 to $39 a share.    Automatic Data Processing slid 1 1/4 to 41 1/2, apparently because of disappointment with its earnings for the June quarter. Net income rose to 73 cents a share from 63 cents a year earlier, with the latest results including a gain from divestitures.    MAI Basic Four lost 1/2 to 4. Chairman Bennett S. LeBow agreed to invest $30 million and provide other financing assistance through a partnership he controls in return for a 51% stake in the company.    The American Stock Exchange index gained 0.84 to 379.18, cutting its loss for the week to 0.4%. The average share price in the latest session rose three cents. Jan Bell Marketing gained 1 3/4 to 23 1/4. Craig Drill Capital, a New York investment partnership, said it holds a 5.08% stake in the company. </TEXT></DOC>
