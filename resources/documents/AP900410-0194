The stuff is on a site called Blekholmstorget, in the shadow ofthe gold-tipped brick tower of Stockholm City Hall, where anapartment and office complex is planned.   Biotreatment of Cardiff, Wales, developed the use of microbes tobreak down ground pollution, and the technique has been employed inBritain and West Germany. This is the first use in a major cleanupthat does not involve hauling away the contaminated soil.   Chief engineer Hans Kronberg said the goal is to purgepotentially cancer-causing grit from about 1.2 acres on the bank ofLake Klara, a channel in Stockholm's interlocking chain of lakes.Dozens of pleasure boats now dock there.   A gas and coke factory was built on the site in 1852 andoperated for about 70 years. Most recently, the site was a parkinglot for the nearby central railway station.   Kronberg said it took scientists nine months to identifyspecific microbes that attack the pollutants involved. Bacteriawere taken from the site and fed oxygen and nutrients to help themmultiply.   When the project begins in May, the plan is to filtermicrobe-enriched water through the soil, which is soaked withcreosote, breaking down the tar-like waste.   Grids of pipes spaced a few yards apart cover the site. Enrichedwater will seep from one set of pipes and be collected by another10 feet below. The water will be pumped to a container foranalysis, treated with nutrients and recycled into the pipes.   ``As of this moment, we can't say if it will work or not,'' cityinspector Viveka Ehd-Falander said. ``We have never done this inSweden before.''   Stockholm officials and federal environmental authorities seethe biological cleanup as a pilot project for opening hundreds ofpolluted acres in the city to development.   Kronberg, who works for the Skanska construction company, saidthe creosote at Blekholmstorget was not a problem while it wasburied under the parking lot asphalt, but would become a threatunder a major housing development.   Engineers fear the creosote would release harmful gases andconstruction work would allow some of it to seep into the lakewater.   Authorities are withholding some building permits until the areais safe. Kronberg said the cleanup project adds about $6 milllionto construction costs.   ``If we didn't clean it up, the pollution would still be therein 100 or 200 years when they rebuild this area again,'' the chiefengineer said.   ``Hot spots,'' or small areas of highly concentrated creosote,may contain up to 30,000 micrograms per kilogram (2.2 pounds) ofpollutants. The number must be reduced to 200 micrograms for thearea to be declared safe.   Land reclamation normally involves excavating polluted earth andtaking it to a safe dump, but that often endangers workers andmerely relocates the problem.   About 26,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil would have to beremoved from Blekholmstorget, enough to bury a football fieldnearly 10 feet deep.   ``There are a lot of places in Stockholm where we'd like tobuild,'' Ms. Ehd-Falander said. ``This is not the only place withdirty soil. It's hard to dig everything up. We don't have places toput it.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Tuesday AMs, April 17</NOTE></DOC>
