Robert Louis-Dreyfus agreed to settle SEC charges that hepassed illegal information to a friend about the pending$1.77 billion purchase of IMS by Dun andamp; Bradstreet Corp. Underterms of the settlement, Mr. Louis-Dreyfus, who neitheradmitted nor denied wrongdoing, agreed to pay a civil penaltyof $213,750 and not to violate securities laws in the future.Five others, including a longtime friend of Mr.Louis-Dreyfus, also settled SEC insider trading charges, theagency said.</LP><TEXT>   Saatchi, the world's second-largest advertising agency,wasn't involved in the matter, an SEC enforcement officialsaid. The incident occurred before Mr. Louis-Dreyfus washired to run the firm. Mr. Louis-Dreyfus, however, will beforced to disclose his run-in with the SEC in public filings,including those of Saatchi, for at least the next five years,the SEC said.   Mr. Louis-Dreyfus &quot;settled this case to avoid the expenseand distraction of a long litigation so that he could devotefull attention to the affairs of Saatchi andamp; Saatchi,&quot; saidRobert Myers, Mr. Louis-Dreyfus's attorney.   The charges strike a serious blow to Mr. Louis-Dreyfus'sreputation at a time when he badly needs the cooperation --and respect -- of the London and New York financialcommunities. The French executive became chief of Saatchijust over a year ago, and he has been trying ever since tospearhead a turnaround of the troubled ad agency holdingcompany.   Under Mr. Louis-Dreyfus's direction, Saatchi's banks areworking on a complicated restructuring plan to dig thecompany out from under a massive debt load. Saatchi'spreferred shareholders have been unhappy with the plan. Thesituation is already precarious, and Mr. Louis-Dreyfus can'tafford anything that might upset it further. Saatchi hasthreatened that if shareholders don't approve the plan, itmay liquidate the company.   Until now, Wall Street analysts have been boosters of Mr.Louis-Dreyfus. After he took over from brothers Charles andMaurice Saatchi, who co-founded the agency, he won approvalby quickly selling Saatchi's ill-conceived consultingdivision. Analysts have staked their hopes for a brighterfuture at Saatchi largely on his reputation.   Three days before IMS announced that it would be acquired,Mr. Louis-Dreyfus, who was in New York to negotiate the pact,told his friend Adina Cohen about the deal, the SEC said. Ms.Cohen traded on the information, then recommended the stockof the market research company to her sister andbrother-in-law and two friends, the SEC said.   While Ms. Cohen didn't tell the four that she knew thedeal was pending with Dun andamp; Bradstreet, a New York publishingand business-information concern, the SEC said her sister andbrother-in-law, Judith and George Lowry, and her friendsRaquel Ramati and Flora Schnall, knew or had reason tobelieve that Ms. Cohen knew Mr. Louis-Dreyfus. The SEC alsocontended that the four, who the agency said also tradedahead of the announcement, knew Mr. Louis-Dreyfus's positionat IMS.   &quot;The allegation is they knew or had reason to know thatCohen was a friend of Louis-Dreyfus and that Louis-Dreyfuswas a senior official of IMS,&quot; said Harry Weiss, associateenforcement director. &quot;Based on the knowledge they had orshould have had, they recklessly disregarded the fact thatthe information could have been tainted.&quot;   After the acquisition was announced in February 1988, IMSshares jumped about $7 each.   Ms. Cohen agreed to disgorge her profit of $106,875, plusinterest, and pay a fine of twice that amount. The otherfriends returned their profits, plus interest, and paid finesequal to the profits.   ---   Joanne Lipman in New York contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
