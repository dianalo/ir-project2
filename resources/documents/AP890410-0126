Sakharov, spurnedin his first try, won easy nomination Monday to a list of 28candidates from the Academy of Sciences who will run for seats inthe new Soviet parliament.   Historian Roy Medvedev, chronicler of dictator Josef Stalin'spurges, emerged a winner in Sunday's runoff election for seats inthe Congress of People's Deputies.   Medvedev, whose critical studies of Stalinism were not publishedin the Soviet Union until recently, won 52.3 percent of the vote inhis race in Moscow's Voroshilov district against Ksenya Razumova,head of an atomic research laboratory, district election officialssaid.   Sakharov was among 28 members nominated to run for 12 unfilledseats out of 20 allocated to the Academy of Sciences in the newcongress, the official Tass news agency reported.   Sakharov, a nuclear physicist who helped develop the Soviet'satomic bomb, won the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize for his human rightsactivities.   He was exiled to the closed city of Gorky in 1980 for hiscriticism of Soviet policies but was allowed to return to Moscow inDecember 1986 and has resumed speaking out on political issues.   Other prominent scientists named in Monday's balloting for theacademy seats included Georgy Arbatov, director of the U.S.A. andCanada Institute; Roald Sagdeev, a space researcher, and economistNikolai Shmelev.   The final list of 28 was chosen from 168 contenders by 37members of the academy's presidium. Reporters who attended thesession said Sakharov got 34 votes, Sagdeev, 37, Arbatov, 36 andShmelev 34.   ``During the first round of balloting on March 21, the academy'sgeneral assembly elected just eight of 23 scientists running forthe 20 seats allocated to it under new Soviet legislation,'' Tasssaid.   A final vote to elect the academy's remaining deputies to thecongress will be taken during a general assembly meeting April19-21, according to Tass.   Of the 2,250 seats in the congress, 750 were assigned to theCommunist Party and its affiliates and to social and professionalorganizations like the Academy of Sciences.   Sakharov previously was proposed as a candidate, but an academyelectoral commission removed him and other reformers from the finallist in favor of old-guard academy managers. Sakharov supporterssuccessfully blocked about two-thirds of that slate and forced thesecond election.   Medvedev, unlike Sakharov, ran in one of the 64 constituenciesthat held runoff elections Sunday for seats that were not filledduring the March 26 nationwide balloting that saw many topCommunist Party and government officials rejected by voters.   While Sakharov faces yet another vote, the selection of Medvedevis final.   The Tass report on the runoff voting said: ``Theseconstituencies had fielded three or more candidates who failed towin the required 50 percent of the vote during the initial round ofvoting.   ``This time, the top two contestants appeared on the ballot and(one) needed only a simple majority to be elected.''   Another winner in Moscow's runoff elections was writer YuriChernichenko, a supporter of former Moscow party boss Boris N.Yeltsin's successful maverick candidacy.   Pamphlets calling for an election boycott appeared in threeMoscow disticts, the Communist Party newspaper Pravda said. It saidthe pamphlets apparently were distributed in the hope that fewerthan 50 percent of voters would turn out, forcing yet anotherelection.   Tass said there were victors in all of the districts and thevoter turnout was 67.1 percent.   In Leningrad, where Communist Party chief Yuri Solovyev andother top officials lost their election bids, lawyer AnatolySobchak won one of six district run-off elections, Tass said.Sobchak ran on a platform similar to Yeltsin's _ an end to specialprivileges for government and party leaders, direct elections ofparty officials and the rule of law.   Lithuania's independent political group Sajudis expanded itsMarch 26 sweep to gain 36 of the Baltic republic's 42 seats in thenew parliament. Only three Sajudis-backed candidates lost, saidspokesman Alvydas Juozaidis.   Kjastutis Zaljaskas, the Communist Party chief of Vilnius who isalso an ethnic Lithuanian, won the runoff against a Sajudis-backedcandidate, Tass reported.   The news agency said new elections will be held May 14 in 199districts nationwide where only one or two candidates ran andfailed to receive the required 50 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
