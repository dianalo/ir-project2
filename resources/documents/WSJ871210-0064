The utility is converting a mothballed nuclear power plant into the cogeneration facility. Cogeneration plants produce both steam and electricity, and are usually owned by businesses that use a portion of the power themselves and sell the rest to local utilities.    CMS reached agreements with CNG Producing Co., a subsidiary of Consolidated Natural Gas Co., and Canterra Energy Ltd. With these new contracts, CMS said it can obtain 58% of the natural gas required when commercial operation of its Midland cogeneration venture begins in 1990 and 43% of the gas needed by 1994.    Consumers Power is putting up the $1.5 billion plant in partnership with Dow Chemical Co., Brown, Boveri andamp; Co. and Fluor Corp. CMS is the parent holding company of Consumers Power, Michigan's largest utility.    When the cogeneration plant is completed, it will supply steam and electricity to Dow and to Consumers Power's electric customers in Michigan. </TEXT></DOC>
