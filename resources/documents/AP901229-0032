Cuban President Fidel Castro on Friday spoke of impendingdismissals of Communist Party officials during a parliamentarysession on ways to restructure the island nation's political andeconomic system, the Havana-based official news agency PrensaLatina reported.   ``Castro expressed that the Central Committee had reachedexcessive levels of personnel,'' said an agency dispatch monitoredin Mexico City.   It said the party personnel must be transferred to farm work andconstruction to meet Cuba's needs in the face of economic crisis.   Soviet economic aid to Cuba hovers at $5 billion a year, andmilitary aid is near the $1.5 billion mark, according to Westernestimates. But economic hard times in the Soviet Union are expectedto mean an aid reduction decision during January trade talks.   The Kremlin maintains it will stand by Castro politically. ButCastro's unflagging rejection of Soviet-style reform may influencethe national Supreme Soviet legislature when it comes to debating aforeign aid bill.   ``If they (Cubans) continue the so-called `old course,' we'lllet them continue. But foreign aid won't be as it was before,''said Nikolai V. Neyland, a member of the Supreme Soviet's ForeignAffairs Committee.   Prensa Latina quoted Castro as saying that two-thirds of theCuban Communist Party's officials were recently cut from the ranksand reported that parliament president Juan Escalona invitedlawmakers' suggestions on how to trim away moreof them.   ``The goal is to propose to the Cuban Communist Party's 4thcongress how municipal governments should be structured and howmany people can function efficiently,'' Escalona said.   The scheduling of the congress, expected to result inconstitutional reform sometime in the first half of 1991, is seenas an indication that Cuba needs to adjust its politicaltrajectory.   Castro has given a cold shoulder to Soviet President Mikhail S.Gorbachev's political reforms, undertaken in 1985.   In turn, Gorbachev's ``new thinking'' on foreign affairs led himto state during a 1989 visit to Cuba that he opposes Castro'ssupport for Communist revolutions in countries such as El Salvador,Angola and Nicaragua.   The Soviets are also promoting a thaw in U.S.-Cuban relations, a31-year antagonism that nearly led to nuclear war over the 1962Cuban missile crisis.   However, the official reason for cutting Soviet aid to Cuba isfinancial.   Gorbachev's foreign aid bill proposes a 75 percent cut in``gratuitous'' foreign economic aid, apparently for all Sovietallies.   It envisions a new policy, starting Jan. 1, requiring allies topay convertible currency at world prices for most trade with theSoviet Union.   That would mean the end of favorable trade terms to Cuba as wellas Vietnam, North Korea, Ethiopia and other countries.   Meanwhile, more than 100,000 supporters of the Communist YouthGuild held a rally in Havana Friday in support of Castro, PrensaLatina said. Castro's Cuban revolution marks its 32nd anniversaryon Tuesday.</TEXT></DOC>
