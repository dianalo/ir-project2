Scavenging bears have pawed through campsites, trash cans anddumps, showed up on golf courses, and even entered one home toempty a refrigerator of groceries and wine.   ``They are capable of eating so many different things,'' saidTodd Malmsbury, Colorado Department of Wildlife public informationofficer. ``They'll be happy to go up to a picnic table and eat yourbreakfast for you.''   Colorado's spring and summer were drier than normal, whichdamaged the berry and acorn crops as well as foliage that bearsfeed on, officials said.   The plight of the hungry bears has become more evident as theanimals prepare to hibernate in early November.   If female bears hibernate without an adequate fat reserve, theycan lose their cubs; other bears without enough fat can die. Butbiologists won't know what kind of effect the food shortage willhave on the mortality rate until spring when a survey of cubs canbe made, said Bob Davies, a state wildlife biologist based inColorado Srings.   Although the Colorado wildlife agency does not keep statewidefigures on bear sightings, Malmsbury said a good guess would bethey have at least doubled this year.   ``We've had problems almost statewide. You tend to have moreproblems where the people are,'' said Bob Davies, a state wildlifebiologist based in Colorado Springs.   In Albuquerque, N.M., there have been 26 bear sightings sinceAugust, said Mark Birkhauser, a conservation officer with the NewMexico Department of Game and Fish. That compares with one or twosightings in an average year.   ``Statewide, we've been having trouble,'' Birkhauser said. ``Theextreme hotspots are Albuquerque, of course, because it's a bigmetro area, and down near Capitan in the Capitan Mountains wherethe bears are feeding on sheep.''   In southeastern Colorado, which has the state's largestconcentration of black bears, wildlife officers have trapped andrelocated more than 60 bears, Malmsbury said. Fewer than 20 bearsare trapped and relocated in that area in an average year.   Along the Front Range of the Rockies, which includesmetropolitan Denver, about 100 bears have been sighted this year,he said. At least nine have been trapped and relocated, and 11 havebeen killed either accidentally or because they were a danger tohumans.   Neither Wyoming nor Montana has reported conflicts with blackbears and humans.   The problems have been compounded by people who are carelesswith trash or feed the animals directly, and other human activity,said Malmsbury.   ``Barbecue smells are extremely attractive to bears, and theycarry a long distance,'' Davies said. ``Bears have an acute senseof smell and they follow their nose right to it.''   One bear recently was killed after it broke into a home in themountain community of Evergreen, west of Denver, and ``ripped openthe refrigerator door, ate food and drank wine,'' Malmsbury said.   In Colorado Springs, early morning golfers reached the fifthhole and looked up to see a 5-year-old female bear in a tree,Davies said. The animal was trapped and moved to a wilderness area.   In July, state wildlife officers killed a bear that attacked awoman at a campground in the foothills west of Denver. The bearripped open her tent, apparently to get at food she had inside,officials said.   Black bears usually grow to about 5 feet and weigh between 200pounds and 300 pounds on the average. There are from 8,000 to12,000 of them in Colorado, mostly in the southern region of thestate.   ``The black bear, by nature, is not going to be an aggressiveanimal normally,'' Malmsbury said. ``Some bears weigh over 400pounds and are 6 feet tall. He can do pretty much whatever he wantsto.''</TEXT></DOC>
