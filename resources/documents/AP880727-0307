Panel members said they were open-minded about the FCC'sproposal to lift limits on the profits of American Telephone andamp;Telegraph Co. and the local Bell phone companies and instead set aceiling on prices. But they said they have yet to see evidence thatthe change would benefit ratepayers.   ``The only thing that we know for certain is that this plan hasraised more questions than it answers,'' said Rep. Edward J.Markey, D-Mass., subcommimttee chairman.   ATandamp;T and the Bell companies have been lobbying hard for a changefrom profit regulation to price caps, but other players in thetelecommunications industry fear the proposal would give theselarge companies too much power over competitors.   The FCC could vote on the plan this fall and put it into effectnext year unless Congress acted to block the plan or pressured theFCC to drop it.   At the panel's hearing, Lawrence Garfinkel, ATandamp;T vice presidentof marketing services, supported the plan as it applied to hiscompany, the nation's largest long-distance company and servingabout 70 percent of the market.   The rates of ATandamp;T, the only long-distance company whoseinterstate business is federally regulated, set the pace for therest of the industry.   Limits on prices rather than profits would ``in all probabilityresult in greater price decreases or smaller price increases'' bycreating incentives for cost-savings by allowing the company to bemore competitive and innovative, Garfinkel said.   But as applied to the Bell companies, the proposal fails toassure that charges for connection to the local phone networks willdrop with declining costs, he said.   MCI Communications Corp., the No. 2 long-distance company, alsoopposes price caps for the Bell companies because of the localcompanies' control of access to the local phone network.   Local access charges are already excessive, and higher chargeswould simply raise long-distance rates for consumers, said GeraldJ. Kovach, MCI senior vice president.   Philip Campbell, chief financial officer of Bell Atlantic, saidthe Bell companies and thus consumers would benefit from the sameencouragement for cost-savings, efficiencies and innovation thatATandamp;T would under price caps.   At a minimum, local phone rates would go up 3 percent less thaninflation, he said.   But Dennis Dundon, chairman of the CompetitiveTelecommunications Association, which represents more than 100long-distance companies, said lifting profit regulation on ATandamp;T andthe Bell companies would be a mistake.   ``Deregulating monopolies is just not good policy,'' Dundon said.   Without adequate controls, ATandamp;T would be able to undercutcompetition by charging below cost for some services and making upthe difference with higher prices on essential services. The Bellcompanies, given more flexibility, could tailor servicearrangements for the large long-distance companies at the expenseof the smaller companies.   ``The price cap plan is appropriate only in a fully competitiveenvironment, where market forces would exercise a check onexcessive or predatory prices,'' he said in his testimony.</TEXT></DOC>
