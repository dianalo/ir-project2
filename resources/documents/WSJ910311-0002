The Quebec Liberal Party platform says the rest of Canadamust agree to a drastic constitutional makeover anddecentralization of federal government powers, or Quebec willhold a referendum on political independence by the fall of1992.</LP><TEXT>   The 2,800 delegates at the party's convention here madeonly minor changes to the constitutional plan, which waswritten by a special committee handpicked by Mr. Bourassa.Several amendments that sought to water down the policy wererejected, to the dismay of some moderate Liberals.   &quot;I'm disappointed with the result. I had expectedsomething different,&quot; said Claude Ryan, a senior Quebeccabinet minister and former party leader. Mr. Ryan left theconvention Saturday and didn't return yesterday. There isspeculation he may resign from the cabinet.   Party moderates were cheered by Mr. Bourassa's closingspeech. &quot;It was a Quebec hoping to stay in Canada&quot; speech,Mr. Bourassa told reporters. At the same time, Mr. Bourassa'shints that Quebec's demands are negotiable confused some ofthe party's staunch nationalists. &quot;I'm all mixed up,&quot; saidGuy Belanger, a member of the Quebec legislature.   The party platform isn't binding on Mr. Bourassa'sgovernment. Mr. Bourassa told reporters he will wait for areport due later this month from a special bipartisancommission and then the cabinet will start working out thegovernment's final position. &quot;Now the real work begins,&quot; saidcabinet minister John Ciaccia. Another cabinet minister saidprivately that the strong support at the convention for theparty platform &quot;really ties our hands, we don't have muchroom to move.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
