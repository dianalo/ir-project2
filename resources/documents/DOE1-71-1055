The car, on mine carwheels, is equipped with a system of rams. A powered support unit isplaced on a platform. Platform position is controlled by the system oframs which change platform inclination from 0 to 120 degrees. A poweredsupport unit can be lifted to a height of 950 mm. The PMG platform weighs3,500 kg and has a capacity of 7,500 kg. It moves on a track sectioninstalled in an assembly chamber. Using the PMG platforms reduces assemblytime by about 3 times.</TEXT></DOC>
