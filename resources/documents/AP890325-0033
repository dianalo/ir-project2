In another development, the trustee of the New York bankruptcycourt hearing the Eastern case, Harry Jones, said Friday he wasconducting a careful search for a bankruptcy examiner.   The Miami Herald reported in today's editions that Jones said hewas looking for someone U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Burton R.Lifland ``knows and trusts'' to mediate disputes among Eastern'smanagement and unions, investigate the airline's sale of Easternassets to parent Texas Air Corp. and report back to the judge andJones.   Also Friday, Lifland extended his order that other airlineshonor agreements on ticket, baggage and cargo transfers Easternbadly needs to keep its few remaining flights in operation; hebarred striking Machinists from picketing on the sidewalk in frontof Eastern's terminal at Boston's Logan International Airport; andflight attendants at Eastern's sister carrier Continental Airlinesended a four-day strike that had little apparent effect.   The developments came on the 21st day of the strike by Eastern's8,500-member machinists union, which has been honored by most ofthe airline's pilots and flight attendants.   Of Eastern's prestrike daily roster of 1,040 flights, about 10percent are still running _ all on the airline's Northeast shuttleand Latin American routes.   In Tallahassee, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals told U.S.District Judge Edward Davis in Miami to hold new hearings todetermine whether the walkout by Eastern's 3,600 pilots is asympathy strike, as the pilots claim _ or a de facto pilots strikeseeking its own aims, as Eastern management contends.   Eastern had asked the appeals court to overturn Davis' earlierruling permitting the Air Line Pilots Association to honor themachinists' pickets under the Railway Labor Act of 1926.   ``A claim of a sympathy strike cannot be used as a pretext toshield conduct that otherwise would be a clear violation of theRailway Labor Act,'' the appeals court said.   The ruling called on Davis to report back to the appeals courtafter his hearings on the issue.   A statement issued by Eastern said that if Davis finds thepilots union has stayed off the job primarily to pursue its ownbargaining objectives, ``the court would be expected to order themback to work.''   The pilots said they were satisfied with the ruling.   ``The appeals court denied Eastern's request for an immediateinjunction and the lawful pilots sympathy strike shall continue,''an a pilots' union statement said.   After cutting fares on its Northeast shuttle service linkingBoston, New York and Washington to as low as $12 to combat thestrike, Eastern on Friday raised ticket prices on those runs totheir original $99 daily and $69 weekend fares.   In New York, Lifland granted a two-week extension to an orderthat competitors honor interline agreements, after Easternattorneys said the carrier's few remaining services would becrippled without cooperation from other airlines.   Lifland's order barring Eastern machinists' picketing on a150-yard-long sidewalk in front of Eastern's terminal at LoganInternational Airport followed the airline's complaint thatMachinists were trespassing on private property.   But Lifland also said his court could not _ and would not _ barpicketing altogether. He said he only wanted to ensure the strikersremained in authorized areas.   In Houston, Texas, spokeswoman Myra Clayton of the Union ofFlight Attendants said the union notifed Continental flightattendants to return to work.   No flights were disrupted or canceled because of the walkout,Continental said. The airline claimed only 200 light attendantstook part in the walkout, while the union claimed more than 1,200of their members struck.   The 6,000-member union called the walkout Monday to protest whatit said were substandard wages and working conditions.</TEXT></DOC>
