(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jon Grunseth, the gubernatorialchallenger in trouble over reports he swam nude with teen-age girlsin 1981, announced late Thursday he will stay in the race afterplanning earlier to withdraw.   ``I came here tonight to withdraw from this race,'' Grunsethtold about 100 supporters.   ``But there has been just an incredible outpouring of love ...and prayer for this family that has overwhelmed both Vicki (hiswife) and me. We are going to press forward no matter (what),'' hesaid.   A source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said earlier thatGrunseth would withdraw on the condition that the party's325-member state central committee name his successor on theballot.   Grunseth kept reporters and anxious supporters waiting for hoursas he huddled with advisers far past 7 p.m., the time he set for anews conference at which he had been expected to announce hiswithdrawal from the race.   Grunseth had been running close to Democratic incumbent RudyPerpich before Oct. 15, when two women charged in sworn statementsthat Grunseth encouraged them to join him in a nude swim in 1981,when they were 13 and 14.   Grunseth, 44, denied the allegation but had been underincreasing pressure from his party to quit the race. He hadconsistently vowed to remain on the ballot.   The source in the Grunseth camp said Grunseth would throw hissupport to Cal Ludeman, a Tracy farmer and former state legislatorwho was the Republican candidate for governor in 1986.   Ludeman scheduled a news conference for later Thursday in thesame Bloomington hotel, but it was never held.   The Grunseth partisan said Grunseth did not want toautomatically hand the GOP spot on the ballot to Arne Carlson, wholaunched a write-in campaign on Monday after losing to Grunseth inthe Sept. 11 primary.   Grunseth, who considers himself a moderate-conservative, hadsaid Carlson, a leader of the moderate wing of the party, is notacceptable to him as the party's gubernatorial candidate.   Elam Baer, executive director of Grunseth's campaign, metprivately with Republican U.S. Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, who said duringa swing through southern Minnesota earlier in the day thatRepublicans can't win the gubernatorial race with both Carlson andGrunseth in the race against Perpich.   ``We have a situation where two Republicans are running and oneDemocrat is running,'' Boschwitz told reporters. ``Our base simplyis not big enough to cut it in half.''   Carlson was not immediately available for comment. He was enroute to Alexandria but canceled the appearance and headed back tothe Twin Cities, said his campaign press secretary, Dave Sampsel.   ``Until we know officially that Jon is out of the race, we don'thave much reaction,'' Sampsel said. ``Up until this point, everyonein the Grunseth campaign has maintained rather steadfastly that Jonwas going to stay in the race until the end.''   Ray Bohn, Perpich's press secretary, said the governor was notimmediately available. He said he did not know if Perpich wouldcomment after Grunseth's news conference.   ``We're sitting 12 days away from a general election and we hopein the next few days the Republican Party will clean up its messand decide who's on the ballot to face Governor Perpich,'' saidPerpich's campaign manager, John Stanoch.</TEXT></DOC>
