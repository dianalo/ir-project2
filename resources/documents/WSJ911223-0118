The 500-page proposal would vastly expand the reach of theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and would launch amore powerful successor organization, called the MultilateralTrade Organization. Unlike the GATT, which works primarily byconsensus, the proposed MTO -- which could include all GATTmembers as well as new participants -- could take jointaction on trade by majority vote.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It sounds like a new United Nations,&quot; said Harvey Bale, aformer U.S. trade official who now works for thePharmaceutical Manufacturers Association. Added HarryFreeman, spokesman for the Multinational Trade NegotiationsCoalition, a Washington group that supports GATTliberalization: &quot;It will be quite controversial.&quot;   GATT Director-General Arthur Dunkel and his staffformulated the proposal to get the stalled talks moving. Hisdraft contains several concessions to U.S. positions onagricultural issues, the most contentious area of the tradetalks. But European Community officials quickly blasted theplan as too far-reaching, and U.S. domestic industries shotback that the plan didn't go far enough to liberalize trade.   Mr. Dunkel had hoped that negotiators would accept orreject the plan on Jan. 13. While rejection remains anoption, acceptance seems far off, said trade experts. U.S.trade officials said that months of hard negotiating remainsbefore the U.S. could finish agreements regardingcommunications, financial services or intellectual property-- the areas that the U.S. had hoped to boost through theGATT negotiations.   On agriculture, there are &quot;still substantial differences,&quot;said Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister who is currentlyEC president. &quot;To a certain extent, of course, that is adisappointment.&quot;   The U.S. was less dismissive. &quot;There are parts that Ithink are acceptable and parts that pose problems,&quot; said U.S.Trade Representative Carla Hills. She added that &quot;there isquite a lot left for the negotiators.&quot;   Mr. Dunkel's text was most specific about liberalizingagricultural markets, which the U.S. has sought as aninducement for developing countries to open their markets forthe import of high-tech goods. The draft proposes thatbetween 1993 and 1999, countries cut export subsidies 36%from a base period of 1986 through 1990. As a result, a U.S.trade official said, EC exports of subsidized wheat wouldshrink to 13 million tons in 1988 from 21 million tons lastyear.   In addition, all agricultural trade barriers would beconverted to tariffs, which would then be cut 36% between1993 and 1999. Countries also would be required to opencurrently shuttered markets to agricultural imports equal toat least 3% of their markets for any commodities in 1993,which would grow to 5% in 1999. Under this provision, forexample, Japan would have to open its protected rice market,while the U.S. would have to open up similarly protectedmarkets for peanuts and other crops.   Ray MacSharry, the EC's agricultural commissioner, opposedthe provisions as too liberal and said the proposal wouldhave to be altered to win EC approval. But the American FarmBureau Federation, the big U.S. agriculture lobby, said theproposal &quot;falls short of substantial and progressivereductions&quot; in agricultural subsidies. Earlier, the U.S. hadsought far deeper cuts in subsidies, but made majorconcessions on the subsidy question last month to try to gainEC support.   In service industries, where the U.S. has expected biggains from the GATT negotiations, opposition to the proposalwas even stiffer. Jack Valenti, president of the MotionPicture Association of America, said the draft would givecountries the right to put quotas on Hollywood-producedtelevision shows. &quot;These quotas will hurt us, bleed us,&quot; hesaid.   In pharmaceuticals, said Mr. Bale, the industryrepresentative, the Dunkel proposal would give countries suchas India and China 20 years, or even longer, before they wereforced to give patent protection to U.S. drugs. &quot;The GATTisn't a free-trade organization,&quot; he says. &quot;It's aprotectionist organization.&quot;   Consumer groups also found much to criticize in theproposal. Lori Wallach, an organizer of the Citizen TradeWatch Committee, said it would let GATT, or its successor,override U.S. environmental and consumer laws in pursuit offreer trade.   For instance, the proposal says that decisions by GATTpanels on environmental issues would go into effect within 60days, unless the decision was appealed, or a &quot;consensus&quot; ofnations opposed the decision. Currently, the opposition of asingle large GATT member can void a decision. &quot;It's anunprecedented loss of national sovereignty to make decisionsover food and environmental policies,&quot; said Ms. Wallach,whose group is associated with consumer advocate Ralph Nader.   With the prospect of business, farm, labor and consumergroups in the U.S. opposing GATT negotiations unless they'resignificantly modified, a number of GATT supporters arediscussing whether the U.S. would be better off without a newagreement. Current GATT rules would stand, they say, and theU.S. could continue to press countries to open their marketsby threatening trade retaliation.   ---   Julie Wolf contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
