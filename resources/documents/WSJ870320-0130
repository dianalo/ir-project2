The complex bank financing agreement, which is expected to be filed today in bankruptcy court in New York, had drawn objections from LTV's unsecured creditors and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., the federal agency that insures corporate pensions, because it tinkered with some aspects of LTV's cash management procedures while leaving others alone.    The big steel, aerospace and energy concern has been operating since last July with protection from creditors' lawsuits, under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, while it works out a plan to pay debt. Since the financing package was first filed with the court last December, bankers, creditors and LTV officials have spent hundreds of hours at the bargaining table reworking the cash management procedures.    As part of the initial agreement between LTV and the 22-member bank group, the company had agreed to restrict the profits it would funnel from its successful aerospace and defense unit to its troubled steel and energy products units. In the first year, LTV could transfer $77 million from the aerospace and defense unit to the parent company, plus 50% of the unit's profits in future years.    That aspect of the accord wasn't changed, the banks and creditors said. Most of the changes involved reporting mechanisms, whereby LTV has agreed to provide detailed information to its creditors about many of its cash transfers, they said. LTV declined to comment until the agreement is filed with the bankruptcy court.    With the revisions, a creditors' spokesman said, &quot;If any movement is made that we feel impairs the ability of the unsecured creditors to protect their interests, we'll have enough notice to go into court.&quot;    The pension agency, which has taken over LTV's four big steel pension funds, also had been concerned that the banks' agreement to repackage about $435 million of secured debt and letters of credit constituted a reorganization plan of sorts. Attorneys representing LTV's banks said language in the agreement was changed and clarified to make it clear that the debts were still considered to be so-called pre-petition claims, which can't be paid outside of a formal reorganization plan.    LTV's Chapter 11 filing cited huge interest and pension costs, and continuing problems at its beleaguered steel unit, the nation's second-largest. The company plans to reorganize around its aerospace and defense unit.    LTV had urged quick approval of the agreement in January, saying it needed the new $100 million in financing for letters of credit to support foreign sales of military and drilling equipment. </TEXT></DOC>
