Reagan's foreign policy positions were reflected in the fiscal1990 budget plan he sent to Congress on Monday. Officials say his$13.2 billion foreign aid spending budget should remain relativelyunchanged by the new Bush administration.   Consistent with past practice, there was no request for Contraassistance in Reagan's final budget. The president routinely hastreated that issue separately, and this time it will be Bush'sdecision.   Another difficult problem to be resolved by Bush is what to doabout the bug-riddled new U.S. Embassy building in Moscow.   In his budget plan for next year, Reagan proposed to give theUnited Nations and other international organizations the full U.S.share of their budgets for the first time since 1986.   In addition, Reagan proposed to throw in $46 million as adownpayment on the $572 million in cumulative U.S. arrears tointernational organizations.   Reagan has held back part of the one-fourth U.S. share of U.N.financing since 1986 to protest what he charged was the world body'swasteful bureaucracy and anti-American tone.   The budget document pronounced that pressure successful and saidthe organization has reformed enough to warrant a reward.   Of the $14.8 billion in total foreign aid budget authority Reaganasked for next year, military assistance to U.S. allies comes toslightly more than $5 billion, about 7 percent over the currentyear. As he has in the past, Reagan sought to convert loan programsfor military sales into straight grants.   Direct economic aid to friendly nations would amount to $3.3billion, a slight increase from the current figure.   As usual, Israel and Egypt were the two largest recipients ofproposed aid. Israel was earmarked for $1.8 billion in military aidand $1.2 billion in economic assistance, or $3 billion in totalspending authority.   Egypt was proposed to receive $2.3 billion, including $1.3billion for military purposes and $815 million in economic aid.   Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead said Bush's nominee forsecretary of state, James A. Baker III, had not been consulted aboutthe budget made public Monday.   But Whitehead said that ``I have no reason to believe there willbe any sharp differences'' in the new administration over the Reaganbudget proposals.</TEXT></DOC>
