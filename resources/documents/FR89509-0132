Introduction and Program Purpose </ITAG>The purpose of this program announcement is to announce the anticipatedavailability of financial assistance to promote self-sufficiency for IndianTribes and American Indian, Native Hawaiian, and Native American PacificIslanders' groups through support of local governance, social and economicdevelopment projects. Funds will be awarded under section 803(a) of theNative American Programs Act of 1974, as amended, Pub. L. 93-644, 88 Stat.2324, 42 U.S.C. 2991b. Proposed projects will be reviewed on a competitive basis against the evaluationcriteria in this announcement. The purpose of the financial assistance provided by ANA under the NativeAmerican Programs Act (the Act) is to promote social and economic self-sufficiencyfor American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native AmericanPacific Islanders (American Samoan Natives and indigenous peoples of Guamand the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands). For the purposesof this program announcement, the term ``Native American'' will be usedto include all eligible groups under the Act except for Alaskan Nativegroups. ANA will publish a separate Fiscal Year 1990 program announcementfor Alaskan Native applicants. ANA believes that responsibility for achieving self-sufficiency rests withthe governing bodies of Indian tribes and in the leadership of Native Americangroups. The development of self-sufficiency requires strengthening governmentalresponsibilities, economic progress, and improvement of social systemswhich protect and enhance the health and well-being of individuals, familiesand communities. Achievement of self-sufficiency is based on the community's ability toplan, organize, and direct resources in a comprehensive manner to achievelong-range community goals. ANA bases its program and policy initiativeson the following three program goals: (1) Governance: to assist tribal governments, Native American institutions,and local leadership to exercise local control and decision-making overtheir resources; (2) Economic Development: to foster the development of stable, diversifiedlocal economies and economic activities which will provide jobs, promoteeconomic well-being, and reduce dependency on public funds and social services;(3) Social Development: to support local access to, control of, and coordinationof services and programs which safeguard the health and well-being of people,and which are essential to a thriving and self-sufficient community. To accomplish these goals, ANA supports tribal governments and other NativeAmerican organizations in the development and implementation of community-based,long-term governance and social and economic development strategies (SEDS)aimed at promoting the self-sufficiency of their own communities. Thisapproach is based on two fundamental principles:(1) The local community and its leadership are responsible for determiningtheir own goals, setting priorities, and planning and implementing programsaimed at achieving those goals; the unique mix of socio-economic, political,and cultural factors involved in each community makes such self-determinationnecessary; the local community is in the best position to apply its owncultural, political, and socio-economic values in deciding on long-termstrategies and programs;  (2) Economic and social development are interrelated, and development inone area should be balanced with development in the other in order to enhanceself-sufficiency. Without a careful balance of the two, the community'sdevelopment efforts may be jeopardized. Expansion of social services, withoutproviding opportunities for employment and economic development, may leadto greater dependency. Conversely, inadequate social services can seriouslyimpede productivity and economic development.  <ITAG tagnum="84">B. Proposed Projects to be Funded  </ITAG>The fundamental task which Native American communities face is developingenduring social and economic strategies in keeping with local goals, resources,and cultural values. ANA is interested in assisting local communities inthe implementation of projects that are a part of long-range strategiesto achieve social and economic self-sufficiency. ANA expects its applicantsto have undertaken a long-range planning process that addresses the community'sdevelopment and encourages social and economic growth for the community.Such long-range planning must consider the maximum use of available resources,directing those resources at opportunities and addressing issues that hinderprogress.  ANA encourages applicants to consider innovative approaches to achievethe specific governance and social and economic goals of the community,and to use non-ANA resources including human, natural, and financial onesto strengthen and broaden the proposed project's impact in the community. All projects funded by ANA must be completed, self-sustaining or supportedwith other than ANA funds at the end of the project period. ANA's fundingof specific projects is not for those programs which operate indefinitelyor have need for ANA funding on a recurring basis.  <T3>Goal 1: Governance. </T3>Effective governance is a necessary foundationand condition for social and economic development of Indian tribes andNative American groups. Efforts to achieve effective governance include:(1) Strengthening the effectiveness of tribal governments; (2) increasingthe ability of tribes and Native American groups and organizations to plan,develop, and administer a comprehensive program supportive of communitysocial and economic self-sufficiency; and (3) increasing awareness of thelegal rights and benefits to which Native Americans are entitled, eitherby virtue of treaties, the Federal trust relationship, legislative authority,or as citizens of a particular state or of the United States.  Under the governance goal, ANA strongly encourages tribal councils andother governing bodies to strengthen and streamline their institutionalmanagement in order to develop and implement social and economic developmentstrategies and to improve the day-to-day management of programs. By improvingsuch capabilities, Indian Tribes and Native American groups can betterdefine and achieve the goals of their people and promote greater efficiencyand effectiveness in the use of available resources.  <T3>Goal 2: Economic development </T3>is the long-term mobilization andmanagement of economic resources to achieve a diversified economy characterizedby widespread distribution of economic resources, services, and benefits;participation of community members in the productive activities and economicinvestments of the community; and pursuit of economic interests in waysthat balance economic gain with social development.  <T3>Goal 3: Social Development </T3>is the mobilization and managementof resources for the social benefit of community members, and involvesthe establishment of institutions, systems, and practices that contributeto the social environment desired by the community. This includes the developmentof, access to, and local control over the institutions that protect thehealth and welfare of individuals and families, and preserve the values,language, and culture of the community.  Building on the foundation of strong local governance, ANA supports tribalgovernments' and other Native American organizations' efforts to achievecoordinated and balanced development and implementation of social and economicdevelopment strategies. These interrelated strategies should coordinateand direct all resources (Federal and non-Federal) toward locally determinedpriorities, and affect the community and its members in ways that promotegreater economic and social self-sufficiency. In addition, these combinedstrategies should provide an independent source of revenue to the communitywhich will assist the applicant in decreasing dependency on public funds. <ITAG tagnum="84">C. Eligible Applicants</ITAG>Current ANA grantees (with the exception of Alaskan Native grantees) whoseproject period terminates in Fiscal Year 1990 (October 1, 1989-September30, 1990) are eligible to apply for a grant award under this program announcement.(The Project Period is noted in Block 9 of the ``Financial Assistance Award''.)Additionally, the following organizations are eligible to apply providedthey are not current ANA grantees:andbullet; Federally recognized Indian Tribes;andbullet; Consortia of Indian Tribes;andbullet; Incorporated non-Federally recognized Tribes;andbullet; Incorporated nonprofit multi-purpose community-based Indian organizations;andbullet; Urban Indian Centers;andbullet; Public and nonprofit private agencies serving Native Hawaiians;andbullet; National or regional incorporated nonprofit Native American organizationswith Native American community-specific objectives;andbullet; Public and nonprofit private agencies serving native peoples fromGuam, American Samoa, or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.The populations served may be located on these islands or in the UnitedStates. Funding for Native American Pacific Islanders projects is subjectto the availability of specific appropriations during FY 1990.This program announcement does not apply to current grantees with multi-yearprojects when applying for continuation funding for their second or thirdbudget periods.Alaska Native applicants are not eligible under this program announcementbecause a separate program announcement for Fiscal Year 1990 funding willbe published specifically for Alaska Native applicants.<ITAG tagnum="84">D. Available Funds</ITAG>Approximately $10 million of financial assistance is available under thisprogram announcement for American Indian and Native Hawaiian projects.This program announcement is being issued in anticipation of appropriationof the necessary funds and is contingent upon that appropriation.Up to $500,000 is available under this announcement for Native AmericanPacific Islanders projects, subject to the availability of FY 1990 specificappropriations, as provided for in section 816(c) of the Act, as amended.Each tribe or Native American organization is eligible to receive no morethan one grant award under this announcement.<ITAG tagnum="84">E. Multi-Year Projects</ITAG>Applicants may apply for projects of up to 36 months duration. A multi-yearproject, one extending more than 12 months, affords grantees the opportunityto undertake more complex and in-depth projects than can be completed inone year. Applicants are encouraged to develop multi-year projects. However,applicants should note that a multi-year project is a project on a singletheme that requires more than 12 months to complete. It is not a seriesof unrelated projects presented in chronological order over a three yearperiod. Funding after the first budget period of a multi-year project isnon-competitive.The budget period for each multi-year project grant will be 12 months.The non-competitive funding for the second and third years will dependupon the grantee's progress in achieving the objectives of the projectaccording to the approved work plan, the availability of Federal funds,and compliance with applicable statutory, regulatory and grant requirements.<ITAG tagnum="84">F. Grantee Share of Project</ITAG>Grantees must provide at least 20 percent of the total approved cost ofthe project, which may be cash or in-kind contributions. The total approvedcost of the project is the sum of the Federal share and the non-Federalshare. The method to compute the non-Federal share is shown in the ApplicationKit. An itemized budget detailing the applicant's non-Federal share andits source must be included in the application. A request for a waiverof the non-Federal share requirement may be submitted in accordance withandSection; 1336.50(b)(3) of the Native American Program Regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">G.

Review Process and Criteria </ITAG>Applications submitted in a timely manner under this program announcementwill undergo a pre-review to determine: andbullet; That the applicant is eligible in accordance with the EligibleApplicant Section of this announcement; andbullet; That the application proposes project objectives which are responsiveto the Program Announcement; and, andbullet; That the application materials submitted are sufficient to allowthe panel to undertake an in-depth evaluation. All required materials andforms are listed in the Grant Application Checklist in the ApplicationKit. Applications which pass the pre-review will be evaluated and rated by anindependent review panel on the basis of five evaluation criteria. Thesecriteria are used to evaluate the quality of a proposed project and todetermine its likelihood of success. A proposed project should reflectthe purposes of ANA's SEDS philosophy and program goals (as described under<T3>Introduction and Program Purpose </T3>of this announcement) and increasethe probability of greater self-sufficiency for a specific tribe or NativeAmerican community. The five programmatic and management criteria are closelyrelated to each other and are considered in judging the overall qualityof an application. Points will be given only to applications which areresponsive to this announcement and these criteria. The five evaluationcriteria are: (1) Long-Range Goals and Available Resources (15 points) (a) The application presents long-range goals, within the context of thecommunity's comprehensive social and economic development goals, whichthe proposed project addresses. (Inclusion of the community's entire developmentplan is not necessary.) (b) Available resources (other than ANA) which will assist and be coordinatedwith the project are described. These resources may be human, natural orfinancial, and may include other Federal and non-Federal resources. (2) Organizational Capabilities and Qualifications (10 Points) Position descriptions or resumes of key personnel, including those of consultants,are included. Position descriptions specifically describe the job and areclearly related to the project. Resumes indicate that the proposed staffare qualified to carry out the project activities. Either a position descriptionor a resumed set forth the qualifications that the applicant believes arenecessary for overall quality management. (3) Project Objectives, Approach and Activities (45 Points) The application proposes specific project objectives and activities. TheObjective Work Plan includes project objectives and activities for <T3>each </T3>budget period proposed and demonstrates that these objectivesand activities: andbullet; Are measurable and quantifiable; andbullet; Are based on a fully described and locally determined balancedstrategy for governance and for social and economic development; andbullet; Clearly address the community's long-range goals; andbullet; Can be accomplished with available or expected resources duringthe proposed project period; andbullet; Indicate when the objective and major activities under each objectivewill be accomplished; and andbullet; Specify who will conduct the activities under each objective. (4) Results or Benefits Expected (20 Points)The proposed project will result in specific, measurable outcomes for eachobjective which will clearly contribute to the overall development of thecommunity and its members. The specific information provided on expectedoutcomes for each objective is the basis upon which the outcomes can beevaluated at the end of each budget year.(5) Budget (10 Points)There is a budget for each budget period requested. The budget fully explainsand justifies the line items in the budget categories in Section B of theBudget Information. Sufficient detail is included to facilitate determinationof allowability and relevance to the project. The funds requested are commensuratewith the scope of the project. For business development projects, the proposalhas demonstrated that the expected return on the funds used to developthe project provides a reasonable profit within a future specified timeframe.<ITAG tagnum="84">J. Guidance to Applicants</ITAG>The following points are provided to assist applicants in developing acompetitive application.(1) Program Guidanceandbullet; ANA reviewers of applications have indicated they are better ableto judge the feasibility and practicality of a proposed economic developmentproject when the applicant has utilized a business plan to discuss theproject. ANA has included sample business plans in the application kit.It is strongly suggested that an applicant use these as a guide in thedevelopment of an application. The more information given a review panelon a proposed business project, the better able it is to evaluate the potentialfor success.andbullet; ANA does not fund on the basis of need. ANA funds projects presentingthe strongest prospects for fulfilling a community's governance, socialor economic development.andbullet; In discussing the problems of the community being addressed inthe application, sufficient background and/or history of the communityconcerning these problems should be included so that the suitability ofthe proposed project will be understood by reviewers. andbullet; The project proposal must clearly identify in measurable termsthe expected results of the project and its positive and continuing impacton the community.andbullet; In the ANA Program Narrative, section A of the application package,<T3>Resources Available to the Proposed Project, </T3>the applicant shouldaddress any specific financial circumstances which may impact on the project,such as any monetary or land settlements made to the applicant and anyrestrictions on the use of those settlements. The specific reasons forseeking ANA funds must be explained when the applicant appears to haveother resources to support the proposed project and chooses not to usethem.andbullet; Supporting documentation or other testimonies from concerned interestsother than the applicant should be used to provide support for the feasibilityof the project.(2) Technical Guidanceandbullet; The application's Form 424 must be signed by the applicant's representativeauthorized to act with full authority on behalf of the applicant.andbullet; ANA suggests that the pages of the application be numbered sequentiallyfrom the first page. This allows for easy reference during the review process.Simple tabbing of the sections of the application is also helpful to thereviewers.andbullet; Two copies of the application plus the original are required.andbullet; Applicants are encouraged to have someone other than the authorapply the evaluation criteria and score the application prior to its submissionin order to gain a better sense of the application's quality and potentialcompetitiveness.andbullet; There is no maximum or minimum amount of Federal funds that maybe requested.andbullet; For purposes of developing an application, applicants should planfor a project start date approximately 120 days after the closing dateunder which the application is submitted.andbullet; ANA will not fund essentially identical projects serving the sameconstituency.andbullet; ANA will accept only one application from any one applicant. Ifan eligible applicant sends in two applications, the one with the earlierpostmark will be accepted for review unless the applicant withdraws theearlier application.andbullet; An application from a Federally recognized tribe must be fromthe governing body.andbullet; The Cover page (included in the Kit) should be the first pageof an application. andbullet; The Approach page (Section B of the ANA Program Narrative) foreach objective proposed should be of sufficient detail to become a dailyor weekly staff guide or responsibilities should the applicant be funded.andbullet; If a profit-making venture is being proposed, profits must bereinvested in the business in order to decrease or eliminate ANA's futureparticipation. Such revenue must be reported as general program income.A decision will be made at the time of grant award regarding appropriateuse of program income. (See 45 CFR Part 74 and Part 92.) andbullet; Applicants proposing multi-year projects must fully describe annualproject objectives and activities. Separate Objective Work Plans (OWP)must be presented for each project year and a separate itemized budgetof the Federal and non-Federal costs of the project for each budget periodmust be included. andbullet; Applicants for multi-year projects must justify the entire time-frameof the project (i.e., why the project needs funding for more than one year)and describe the results to be achieved by the end of each budget periodof the total project period. andbullet; The applicant should specify the entire project period lengthon the first page of the Form 424, Block 13, not the length of the firstbudget period. Should the application's contents propose one length ofproject period and the Form 424 specify a conflicting length of projectperiod, ANA will consider the project period specified on the Form 424as governing. andbullet; Line 15a of the 424 should specify the Federal funds requestedfor the first<T3> Budget Period,</T3> not the entire project period.(3) Projects or Activities That Generally Will Not Meet the Purposes ofThis Announcement andbullet; Projects which support a grantee in providing training and/ortechnical assistance (T/TA) to other tribes or Native American organizations(``third party T/TA''). However, the purchase of T/TA by a grantee forits own use or for its members' use (as in the case of a consortium), whereT/TA is necessary to carry out project objectives, is acceptable. andbullet; Feasibility studies, business plans, marketing plans or writtenmaterials such as manuals that are not an essential part of the applicant'slong-range development plan. ANA is not interested in funding ``wish lists''of business possibilities. ANA expects evidence of solid investment oftime and thought on the part of the applicant to any development of businessplans, etc. andbullet; Creation of social service programs or expansion or continuationof existing social service delivery programs. andbullet; Core administrative functions or other activities that essentiallysupport the applicant's administrative functions. andbullet; Project goals which are not responsive to one or more of the threeANA goals (Governance, Economic Development, Social Development). andbullet; Project plans or strategies that do not meet the needs of thelocal community. andbullet; Proposals from consortia of tribes that are not specific in regardto support from and roles of member tribes. andbullet; Projects which should be supported by other Federal funding sourcesappropriate and available for the proposed activity. andbullet; Activities that will not be completed by the end of the projectperiod; or andbullet; Activities that will not be self-sustaining at the end of theproject period; or andbullet; Projects that will not be supported by other than ANA funds atthe end of the project period. andbullet; Lack of demonstrated coordination with non-ANA resources. andbullet; Lack of a justification or explanation for requesting ANA funds,or a lack of discussion of other resources and revenues for use in theproject. andbullet; The purchase of real estate (see 45 CFR 1336.50(e)) or construction(see HDS Grants Administration Manual Ch.3, E.).ANA will critically evaluate applications within which the acquisitionof major capital equipment (whether oil rigs or computers/word processingequipment), franchises or the payment of management fees are major componentsof the Federal share of the budget. During negotiation, such expendituresmay be deleted from the budget of an otherwise approved application.ANA will also critically evaluate projects reflecting heavy reliance onuse of outside consultants, especially where consultants have preparedthe application and have provided a major role for themselves in the proposedproject.<ITAG tagnum="84">K.
