The rails are right there,&quot; she says,indicating empty railroad tracks that parallel the highway.&quot;All you would have to do is put locomotives and cars onthem.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Ms. Daly, a human-resources manager at the Department ofAgriculture, should soon see big changes on her way to work.Next spring, Virginia officials plan to put commuter trainsto Washington on the tracks of the Richmond, Fredericksburg andamp;Potomac Railroad, which are now used only by freight trainsand Amtrak.   For many years, commuter-rail operations have been limitedto a handful of large cities such as New York andPhiladelphia. All too often, commuter trains have been a formof transportation synonymous with decay, deficits and delays.But that is changing, as public-transit officials fromVirginia to California prepare to launch new commuter-railservices to ease problems of mobility, congestion andpollution.   &quot;In the past, commuter rail was dirty and slow, and youcould get to work in half the time by car,&quot; says WilliamWithuhn, transportation curator of the SmithsonianInstitution in Washington. &quot;Now, we are choking on all thecars, and it's becoming easier to take the train.&quot;   Plans for commuter-rail service are nowhere more ambitiousthan in California, where voters last year approved measuresthat would provide $3 billion for rail projects includingcommuter services. &quot;People are fed up with the freeways andwant alternatives,&quot; says David Solow, senior manager ofcommuter-rail operations for the Southern California RegionalRail Authority.   California officials say they will launch commuter trainson three freight-rail lines to Los Angeles in October 1992.They plan to expand the network to eight routes and over 400miles of track by 1995.   Planners for the new systems have been encouraged byTri-Rail, a commuter service linking the Florida cities ofMiami and West Palm Beach that was considered a temporarymeasure when it was launched by the state two years agoduring a highway-reconstruction project. But the trains haveproved so popular that Florida transportation officials noware adding cars and expanding service.   Commuter-rail service is making a comeback in cities withestablished networks, too. For example, Boston has spenthundreds of millions of dollars in the past 10 years to buynew commuter trains, rebuild stations and replace track.Transit officials there plan to restore commuter service onthree lines south of the city that ceased operation in 1959.   &quot;It's one of the most unlikely renaissances anyone wouldhave predicted 15 years ago,&quot; says Eugene Skoropowski,director of rail projects at Fluor Daniel Inc. in Irvine,Calif., who remembers the dilapidated commuter trains he rodein the 1970s as a suburban Boston commuter. Train ridersopened their umbrellas inside the cars when it rained, hesays. And some of them brought flashlights to read thenewspaper because the overhead lights in the cars were oftenmissing.   Critics doubt the new services will attract enough ridersto make a dent in highway congestion or to cover theiroperating costs. They also question the wisdom of creatingrail systems to bring commuters downtown when companies aremoving to suburban locations.   &quot;The trend in modern life is to go toward moredecentralization, more telecommuting and more diverse originsand destinations for the trips made,&quot; says John Semmens, aneconomist at the Laissez Faire Institute, a think tank inTempe, Ariz. &quot;You aren't going to reverse that by building acouple of commuter lines.&quot;   Commuter-rail opponents say that commuter-rail operationsmake only a minor contribution to the nation's mobilityexcept in a few places. Commuter-rail ridership nationwidecurrently totals just over 1.1 million passengers a day, 60%of whom are carried by systems in the New York City region.   Even so, advocates say there are a lot of reasons thatcommuter-rail services will play a bigger role. Commuter-railservice &quot;won't solve all our traffic problems,&quot; says SharonBulova, a Fairfax County, Va., supervisor. &quot;But it will helpsolve the problem of traffic to {the center of cities}, andthere's a lot of it.&quot; Other proponents add that unlikehighway and mass-transit systems, which take many years tobuild, commuter-rail services can be started sooner and morecheaply over existing tracks owned by freight railroads.   And some freight railroads, which in the past haveregarded commuter trains on their tracks as a burdensomeinterference, are changing their view. Railroads &quot;all of asudden have awakened to the fact that their urban segmentshave a very big unrealized profit potential,&quot; says Robert L.Banks, a transportation consultant in Washington.   Southern California officials paid $450 million toSouthern Pacific Transportation Co. for track and trackagerights that will be used by commuter trains. Now, they arenegotiating with Santa Fe Pacific Corp. for additional raillines needed to complete their planned commuter-rail system.But the company and a five-county commuter-rail authorityremain far apart on price and terms.   Various companies are preparing to capitalize oncommuter-rail growth. Last year, Morrison Knudsen Corp., anengineering-services company based in Boise, Idaho, refitteda plant to build new commuter-rail coaches.   Amtrak is vying with UTDC Inc., a Canadian rail-carbuilder, for the contract to operate the Los Angelescommuter-rail system. To make itself more competitive, Amtrakhas won the right from its rail unions to suspend some costlywork rules. And Burlington Northern Inc., a bigfreight-hauling railroad that currently operates a Chicagocommuter line, is negotiating to become the operator of newcommuter-rail services being discussed in Denver and Seattle.&quot;We move things over the rail, and it's not relevant whetherit is a passenger or a freight train,&quot; says DJ Mitchell II,assistant to Burlington Northern's chairman.   Some of the new commuter-rail projects are being designedto avoid the high costs of old systems. That's true innorthern Virginia, where commuter trains are expected to rollsoon on freight tracks connecting Fredericksburg and Manassasto Washington.   Thomas Waldron, rail manager of Virginia Railway Express,says the system will use commuter cars made in Brazil pulledby rebuilt freight locomotives. Tickets will be dispensed bymail or by machines at rail stations. A computerizedtelephone-information system is &quot;equivalent to 32 warm bodiesin a room I don't have to pay,&quot; says Mr. Waldron. Mobilevendors will sell coffee, doughnuts and newspapers tocommuters at rail stations and take dry-cleaning orders.   Virginia Railway Express has faced setbacks. It had tosecure expensive liability insurance before freight railroadswould agree to let commuter trains use their tracks. Thelaunch of the service has been delayed six months to nextspring because the Brazilian rail-car builder has fallenbehind schedule. Some local officials have proved less thanenthusiastic about shouldering the financial burden for thenew service. &quot;A lot of local people feel it is unfair forthem to pay for someone else's ride,&quot; says Emmitt Marshall, asupervisor of rural Spotsylvania County, which declined tolevy a gas tax that would help fund commuter-rail services.   Nevertheless, Virginia Railway Express's Mr. Waldron isconfident that mounting traffic congestion bodes well forcommuter railroads. He makes that prediction while he drivesat rush hour on I-66 toward Manassas, where a commuter-railstation and parking lot is under construction. When he seestraffic backed up ahead, Mr. Waldron brakes his car abruptly.   &quot;I love it,&quot; says Mr. Waldron about such congestion on thehighway. &quot;It's called job security.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
