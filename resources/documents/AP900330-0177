The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for theDistrict of Columbia. It did not name countries, but a pressstatement said the organizations have documents to show violationsin Guatemala, El Salvador, Malaysia, Haiti, the Philippines,Thailand, Turkey and Indonesia, among others.   About 140 areas are privileged to ship some of their products tothe United States duty-free, or at reduced duties, under what iscalled the Generalized System of Preferences. The reduced dutiesallow the products to be sold in this country at lower prices thansimilar goods from other countries. The system is designed to helpthe Third World countries develop their industries.   The law setting up the system limits the benefits to countriesthat respect internationally recognized worker rights. Theseinclude a ban on child labor, special provisions for women, theright to form labor unions and others.   Under this provision, U.S. authorities have banned Nicaragua,Romania and Burma from the program and suspended Paraguay, Chileand the Central African Republic. Marshall and the othercomplainants consider that inadequate.   ``The Bush administration's refusal to enforce the law giveslarge, multinational firms a windfall at the expense of bothAmerican and foreign workers,'' Marshall said in a statement.   ``Businesses can earn great profits in developing countriesrelatively free from labor regulation, export their productsduty-free to the U.S. market, displace American workers, and takeadvantage of unprotected foreign workers.''   The complaint was filed by the AFL-CIO and 22 other labor unionsand private groups, including Marshall's own International LaborRights Education and Research Fund, an advocacy group. It asked thecourt to interpret the law and to order Bush and his administrationto review the rights of labor in all the countries that benefitfrom it.   The office of U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said theaction had been signalled in advance but it had no comment. Bushand six members of his Cabinet named as defendants, including Ms.Hills, have 60 days to reply.</TEXT></DOC>
