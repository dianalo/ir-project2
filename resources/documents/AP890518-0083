The trouble came from war-weary troops in the north, who havebeen fighting rebels of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front.   After receiving word of the coup attempt, Mengistu cut short astate visit to East Germany and returned Wednesday night to AddisAbaba, where loyal soldiers defeated mutinous troops in a battle inthe capital.   The city was calm today, but troops still guarded most keygovernment buildings and the international airport remained closed.   At least two rebellious generals and the defense minister havebeen killed in the fighting, but the total number of casualties wasnot known.   Addis Ababa state radio today urged people to return to work.   Radio broadcasts from Ethiopia's second-largest city, thenorthern provincial capital of Asmara, declared the coup a successand urged the rest of the military to join the revolt.   Soldiers backing the coup also were supported by secessionistrebels the troops have been fighting in the province. Theclandestine radio of the Eritrean People's Liberation Frontdeclared today a two-week cease-fire ``to facilitate the successfuloutcome'' of the military revolt that began Tuesday.   Voice of the Eritrean Masses, the rebel radio, said Ethiopia's2nd Army _ a force of 150,000 men _ has full control of Asmara,capital of the northernmost province of Eritrea where the rebelshold three-fourths of the countryside.   It said the rebels are discussing with army officers in Asmara``the best ways to intensify the struggle against ... the commonenemy.''   The rebellious soldiers commandeered a former government radiostation in the city and broadcast in the name of the ``Armed Forcesof Eritrea.''   They said they ``called on the (rebels) to join hands'' inousting Mengistu, but it was not clear whether the rebels andsoldiers had formed an alliance. Such an association would mean thegovernment had lost control of the province, Ethiopia's only accessto the Red Sea.   The revolt began Tuesday, just hours after Mengistu and his wifeleft for East Berlin. It was put down in the capital in 24 hours.   Addis Ababa state radio today announced the death of the defenseminister, Maj. Gen. Haile Giorgis Habte Mariam, saying ``one of theplotters shot him repeatedly'' Tuesday when he refused to join thecoup attempt.   Two rebellious officers also were killed Tuesday: Maj. Gen.Merid Negusie, the chief of staff, and the air force commander,Maj. Gen. Amha Desta.   There were unconfirmed reports that a third coup leader, Maj.Gen. Kumalapchew Dejene, the deputy commander of the armed forcesin Eritrea, was hunted down and killed by loyalist soldiers onWednesday.   State radio said another coup plotter was arrested _ IndustryMinister Fanta Belai who used to command the air force.   Mengistu inherited the 28-year-old northern civil war when heand a clique of army officers deposed Emperor Haile Selassie in aMarxist revolution Sept. 12, 1974. Since then, his biggest ally,the Soviet Union, has helped build the Ethiopian army into Africa'sbiggest and best equipped, though many troops are unwillingconscripts. They have been fighting 30,000 Eritrean rebels and20,000 insurgents who want more autonomy in neighboring TigreProvince.   Persistent reports of military unrest in Ethiopia citewar-weariness among field commanders unhappy with the level ofgovernment support they are receiving in waging the war, which isthe oldest in Africa.   Eritrea is a former Italian colony that was federated withEthiopia in 1957 under a U.S.-sponsored U.N. resolution. Selassieannexed the territory in 1962.</TEXT></DOC>
