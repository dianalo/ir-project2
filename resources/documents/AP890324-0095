In a two-sentence motion, Sullivan asked that U.S. District JudgeGerhard A. Gesell ``enter an order'' enforcing an earlier subpoenafor Reagan's appearance at the trial of the former White Housenational security aide.   Gesell ruled Jan. 30 that the former president shall remain``subject to call'' in connection with a subpoena issued by North'slawyers and served on Reagan on Dec. 30.   Defense lawyers have brought out at North's trial that Reagan wasmuch more involved in secretly assisting the Contra rebels than haspreviously been known publicly.   Sullivan brought out that Reagan personally approved, based on arecommendation by North and others on the National Security Councilstaff, a secret 1985 deal to give Honduras $110 million in covertaid as an inducement to support the Contras.   The defense also brought out that Reagan apparently approved aplan from North and others in the government to airdrop intelligencedata and recoilless rifles to the Contras for the purpose ofdestroying ships carrying arms to the Nicaraguan government.   Reagan's actions came at a time when Congress had banned U.S.military aid to the Contras.   Reagan told the Tower Commission, which investigated theIran-Contra affair, on Jan. 26, 1987 that ``he did not know that theNSC staff was engaged in helping the Contras.''   Reagan and then-Vice President Bush were served with subpoenasfrom North's lawyers, and Reagan and Bush both sought to quash thesubpoenas.   In a Jan. 13 court filing on their behalf, Attorney General DickThornburgh said the subpoenas ``raise profound constitutionalconcerns.   The concerns are in connection with ``executive privilege ... butalso regarding the authority of the courts to compel appearances bya former or sitting president,'' said Thornburgh.   ``The spectacle of a former or sitting president being subjectedto peremptory judicial process may chill foreign governments in theway they deal with the president now and in the future,'' saidThornburgh.   In his Jan. 30 ruling, Gesell said North had failed todemonstrate that Bush ``has any specific information'' that wouldmake his testimony ``relevant and material'' to the charges againstNorth. The judge quashed the subpoena against the new president.   Gesell said he would await developments in the trial with regardto the subpoena for Reagan.   On Thursday at North's trial, an NSC aide to North said heassumed that profits from a 270 percent price markup on weaponssecretly sold to Iran were funneled to the Contras.   Marine Lt. Col. Robert Earl testified that North brought him intothe Iran arms-for-hostage deal in April 1986.   ``At some point in my briefing ... it was mentioned that part ofthe monies hat the Ayatollah was providing would be going to supportthe Contras in Nicaragua,'' Earl testified.   As the NSC aide prepared for a May 1986 shipment of Hawk missilespare parts, ``I remember Lt. Col. North asking for some help'' indetermining how much to charge the Iranians.   Earl, a former Rhodes scholar, looked at the markup on a previousarms shipment and, based on that, charged the Iranians $3.70 foreach dollar in cost to the U.S. government.   North is charged with lying to the attorney general on Nov. 23,1986, by denying that the NSC was involved in the diversion of fundsto the Contras and by saying Israel determined the amount of thediversion.</TEXT></DOC>
