Within the framework of searching for relatively simpleand universal eddy viscosity/diffusivity models, a new three dimensionalnon isotropic model is proposed applicable to any domain complexity andany atmospheric stability conditions. The model utilizes the transportequation for turbulent kinetic energy but introduces a new approach ineffective length scale estimation based on the flow global characteristicsand local atmospheric stability. The model is discussed in detail andpredictions are given for flow field and boundary layer thickness. Theresults are compared with experimental data with satisfactory results.</TEXT></DOC>
