The images are embedded in American popular culture: CharlieBrown trying to kick a football, Snoopy gunning for the Red Baronand Lucy dispensing psychiatric advice, a nickel's worth at a time.   Now it's time to celebrate.   In honor of the 40th anniversary of the comic strip ``Peanuts,''there's a jazz concert at Carnegie Hall, a birthday party at theNatural History Museum of Los Angeles County and a special exhibitat the Smithsonian Institution.   On Oct. 2, 1950, ``Peanuts'' made its debut in seven newspapers,and good ol' Charlie Brown and his beguiling beagle were on theirway to becoming an international phenomenon.   Today the strip runs in 2,300 newspapers and reaches more than200 million readers a day in 68 countries. The Peanuts gang speaksChinese, even Serbo-Croatian.   There's been a hit musical, ``You're a Good Man, CharlieBrown,'' a series of TV specials and a book on the philosophicaland religious implications of the strip, ``The Gospel According toPeanuts.''   In September, cartoonist Charles M. Schulz was one of Forbesmagazine's top 10 richest entertainers, with earnings for 1989 and1990 estimated at $54 million.   Unlike many cartoonists, the 67-year-old Schulz still drawsevery comic strip himself.   ``Why do musicians compose symphonies and poets write poems?''he asked. ``They do it because life wouldn't have any meaning forthem if they didn't.   ``That's why I draw cartoons. It's my life.''   The cartoonist was born in St. Paul, Minn. He studied art inhigh school, after he saw a ``Do you like to draw?'' ad.   Schulz later did lettering for a church comic book, taught artand sold cartoons to the Saturday Evening Post. His cartoon feature``Li'l Folks,'' the forerunner of Peanuts, was developed for theSt. Paul Pioneer Press in 1947. The strip was sold to a syndicatein 1950, and the name changed to ``Peanuts.''   Charlie, the round-headed boy in the sawtooth shirt, was namedafter a friend at art school and is the cartoonist's alter ego.Snoopy was inspired by a dog he had as a child.   The little red-haired girl - Charlie's unrequited love who isnever shown in the strip - was based on a girlfriend who rejectedSchulz's proposal of marriage.   Through the years, for the millions of readers, Charlie and hisgang have been like family. Followers know that Snoopy - in hisWorld War I flying ace incarnation - flies a Sopwith Camel. Theyknow Linus needs his security blanket and awaits the Great Pumpkinevery Halloween. They know Schroeder plays Beethoven on his tinypiano.   The 40th birthday festivities kicked off at the Super Bowl inNew Orleans in January with a halftime show featuring the Peanutscharacters.   On Monday, the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County willsalute Charlie, Snoopy, Linus, Schroeder, Peppermint Patty, Sally,Lucy - and Schulz - with an exhibit that premiered at the Louvre inJanuary.   There will be original artwork by Schulz, excerpts from the morethan 40 Peanuts television shows and Snoopy mementos that werecarried aboard NASA's Apollo 10 mission.   New York City will toast Schulz and his characters Oct. 24 witha jazz concert at Carnegie Hall, featuring saxophonist GroverWashington Jr. and bassist Ron Carter. The Peanuts TV special havebeen noted for their original jazz scores.   Opening Oct. 30 at the Smithsonian is ``This is Your Childhood,Charlie Brown - Children in American Culture, 1945-1970,'' anexhibit that looks at how Schulz's comic strips reflected childhoodand American culture after World War II.   There will also be a ``Snoopy: The Universal Dog'' exhibit atthe Dog Museum in St. Louis, starting Nov. 11.
