Brown said Friday. In addition, thedistrict's 11 elementary schools, middle school and two high schools will haveto cut costs by 5 percent.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  P.A. SCHOOLS WARN AIDES OF POSSIBLE LAYOFFCUTBACKS FORCE TRUSTEES TO NOTIFY 32 EMPLOYEES  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     &quot;Nobody's in good shape,&quot; Brown said. &quot;But this is relative. We are havingto make reductions this year, but not on the scale that some of the otherdistricts have to make.&quot;;    The trustees' decision was prompted by the needto give workers' 30 days' notice of any layoffs, even though the actual budgetsituation may not become clear until midsummer and the cuts may not have to beso deep.;    &quot;We are in the unfortunate position of having to issue layoffnotices assuming a worst-case scenario and then see if we can do better as thebudget process continues,&quot; said Joseph Simitian, president of the board.;   At a special meeting Thursday, the board also sent layoff notices to somesupport personnel in the high schools. Administrators were notified ofpossible transfers last month. Unlike many other districts, however, noteachers in the 7,500-student district have been laid off.;    The teacher'saides, who earn between $9 and $11 per hour, work directly with students inthe classroom, providing badly needed individual attention and reducing theadult-student ratio, Brown said.;    &quot;Our aides believe they have a verypositive impact on instruction,&quot; he said. &quot;When you have two people working ina classroom instead of one, you have more time and attention, so students willbe affected.&quot;;    The cuts will fall disproportionately on schools, such asOhlone, that rely more heavily on teacher's aides. Other schools have spenttheir funds on part-time teachers or instructional technology instead.;   Cushioning the cuts will be the transfer of sixth-grade students from theelementary schools to J.L. Stanford Middle School and Jordan Middle School,which will reopen next year. The transfer will free the remaining aides towork in kindergarten through fifth-grade classrooms.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DAVID BANK, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Peninsula/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910427  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  373  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday April 27, 199100118074,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
