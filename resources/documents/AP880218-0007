The growing willingnessof couples to defy the one-child limit threatens to send thepopulation zooming out of control.   China has estimated that to hold its population within theplanned limit of 1.2 billion in 2000 and 1.5 billion in 2050, itmust keep the birth rate below 1.5 percent.   But the birth rate hit 2 percent in 1986 and stayed there in1987. If that pace is maintained, China's 1 billion people willbecome 2 billion by 2030, according to a recent estimate by theU.N. Fund for Population Activities.   In a recent front-page commentary, the official People's Dailydeclared the family planning situation was ``out of control'' insome provinces.   ``One false move may lose the game,'' it said. ``China'scontinuously growing population is in fact facing a crisis.''   The surge is fueled largely by newly prosperous peasants whohave enough money to pay government fines for breaking theone-child limit and incentives under the new economic reforms to doso.   Since the breakup of communes in the early 1980s, families havebeen responsible for farming their own plots of land. More childrento help plant and harvest means more profit.   Even urban residents, who surveys indicate are less eager thanpeasants to have large families, envy the ease with which newlyrich peasants have been able to ``buy'' extra children.   Fines vary from region to region but generally amount to about$270 per year for five years. The amount isn't prohibitive ifseveral family members chip in.   The average rural income is about $270 per couple, but annualfamily incomes of several times that amount are increasingly common.   City residents face not only fines but suspension from work forone or two years for having a second child.   Officials responded to the high 1986 birth rate with calls forbetter birth control education. But when the 1987 figures came out,the family planning minister, Wang Wei, was sacked.   The government also announced measures to tighten localenforcement of the one-child limit by linking it to officials'paychecks.   At an urgent meeting of family planning officials early thisyear, acting Premier Li Peng ordered that officials be rewarded orpunished based on how well they enforce the one-child policy.   But Chinese authorities, sensitive about past U.S. congressionalcharges of coerced abortions, said at a recent news conference thatofficials will not be rewarded for high numbers of abortions intheir jurisdictions.   ``Efforts are to be made to raise the use of birth control andcontraceptive methods and reduce the number of abortions,'' saidLiang Jimin, director of the Family Planning Commission's generaloffice.   He insisted that only ``education and persuasion'' would be usedto encourage abortions when families already have a child.   In an apparent reflection of the new tough attitude, medicalworkers in Beijing said hospitals recently have begun refusingadmission to women about to give birth to a second or third child.   Family planning authorities also have gotten tougher on migrantworker families who have taken advantage of their roving status toflout the one-child limit.   The official Xinhua News Agency said some migrant couples haveas many as five or six children.   In the northeastern city of Shenyang, officials ruled in Januarythat employers must issue ``planned birth cards'' to all migrantworkers so their family sizes can be recorded and monitored.   Family planning education programs have been stepped up. Almostthe only propaganda posters still seen in China are those toutingthe one-child policy.   China Central Television, mindful that half of all Chinese homeshave televisions, broadcast weekly programs on family planning lastyear.   But a combination of demographics and superstition make itlikely births will increase rather than drop in 1988.   The population of child-bearing women increased by 7 million in1987 and will grow by 8 million this year, to 297 million, as theproducts of China's baby boom of the 1960s reach maturity.   Furthermore, 1988 is the year of the dragon in China'straditional 12-year astrological cycle. The dragon is a symbol ofgood luck and power, and many young couples are expected to try tohave their one child this year.   The official Workers' Daily recently tried to debunk traditionalbeliefs about lucky ``dragon babies.'' If birth control limits areignored, it warned, ``the dragon year will not be lucky for anover-populated nation.''</TEXT></DOC>
