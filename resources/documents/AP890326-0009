The sales talk will come at the spring meeting of the 151-nationInternational Monetary Fund and World Bank, the two major lendingorganizations, and at a separate strategy session attended byofficials from the seven largest industrial countries.   The sessions should be lively. Already, the Brady plan is beingviewed as a crucial watershed for the 7-year debt crisis, which hasat various times threatened financial calamity for major U.S. banksand turned Latin America into a political time bomb as strugglingdemocracies in the region tried to cope with growing debtrepayments.   The Brady plan, as the new initiative is being called, seeks toencourage commercial banks to voluntarily forgive part of the $1.3trillion in debt owed by poor countries in return for guaranteesbacked by the IMF and World Bank that the remaining pool of debtwill be repaid.   The new administration received high marks for abandoning whatmany considered to be the failed policies of the Reaganadministration, which repeatedly refused to endorse any broad-scaleeffort at debt forgiveness.   But critics, including many of the largest debtor countries,complain that the Brady proposal does not go far enough, especiallyin view of the economic and political pressures building in much ofLatin America.   Riots in Venezuela last month left more than 300 people deadafter the government announced a new austerity program implementedto please the IMF and other creditors who hold $33 billion of thatcountry's debt.   The administration is hoping to come out of the IMF and WorldBank session with a general endorsement of the principles of thenew debt approach when the meetings wrap up on April 4. But many ofthe debtor countries are pushing for quick debt relief to accompanythe rhetoric.   Venezuela's President Carlos Andres Perez has termed the Bradyproposals ``very timid'' and officials in that country are alreadysaying they may have to defer debt repayments if they don't gethelp soon. Similar warnings have come from Mexico.   Some observers say that the Brady plan, while attempting toresolve the debt crisis, may initially lead to a greater period ofinstability as debtors balk at meeting obligations on their olddebt while they wait to see the details of the debt relief packages.   Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, who played aleading role in the initial U.S. response to the debt crisis in1982, has warned that debt reduction could end up hurting bothcreditor and debtor countries if not properly managed.   Most observers believe the United States must come up withconcrete results quickly, at least with new initiatives for Mexicoand Venezuela, or risk more turmoil because of dashed expectations.   ``It is important that debtor nations not get their expectationstoo high. The Brady proposal represents measured improvement, notradical relief,'' said William Cline, an economist with theInstitute for International Economics, a Washington think tank.   Assistant Treasury Secretary David Mulford, the key architect ofthe Brady plan, says the administration's goal is to reduce thetotal debt burden of 39 heavily indebted countries by 20 percentover a three-year period with a similar 20 percent reduction ininterest payments.   The Treasury believes that commercial banks can be enticed intowriting off a portion of their Third World loans by getting the IMFand World Bank to earmark an unspecified amount of funds toessentially guarantee the payments on the remaining level of debt.   Officials of the lending organizations, while generallysupportive of the Brady proposals, said they need to see details onjust how much money they will be expected to put up.   In addition to trying to line up support with the two majorlending organizations, Brady faces the task of selling hisproposals to officials of the world's largest industrial countries.Finance ministers and central bank presidents of the so-calledGroup of Seven, composed of the United States, Japan, West Germany,Britain, France, Canada and Italy, will hold daylong discussionswhich are expected to focus on the debt plan.   Brady used a similar get-acquainted session in February to soundout U.S. allies to the debt proposal the administration wascrafting.   Based on initial comments, many observers expect the Bushadministration will win at least general agreement from the debtorand creditor countries and officials at the world lendingorganizations that the U.S. proposals are worth pursuing.   ``The less-developed countries are now expecting something to bedone and that means something has to be done,'' said David Wyss,chief financial economist at Data Resources Inc., a Lexington,Mass., consulting firm. ``Brady has clearly signalled the directionin which things will move.''</TEXT></DOC>
