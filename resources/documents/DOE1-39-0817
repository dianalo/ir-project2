However, the off-cycle losses associated with cyclic operation resultin seasonal efficiencies in the order of 60% or less. The new designsfor high efficiency furnaces are presented. One of these is an air-basedfurnace design incorporating a low-temperature plastic heat exchangerin the condensing section with a novel, possibly patentable, featureto permit the use of the low temperature plastic material. The otherdesign is a hydronic-combination unit that accomplishes both the spaceheating and domestic hot water heating functions in the same appliance.The space heating system can be either water-based or, with the provisionof a blower-finned coil unit, air-based. Preliminary cost estimates indicatethat both of the designs presented should be very competitive when comparedto the cost of heating units currently available. 17 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
