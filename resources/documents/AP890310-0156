The lawsuit, unsealed Thursday in U.S. District Court, accusesNorthrop Corp. of falsifying test results on parts for nearly 1,800of the nuclear-tipped missiles, which are launched from bombers andskim the earth toward their targets.   ``These are critical guidance and flight control systems partsfor the air-launched cruise missile,'' said Mary McMenimen,spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's office here. ``These units areon B-52 and B-1 bombers stationed both in the U.S. and overseas.''   The cruise missile is a subsonic, jet-powered missile with smallwings. It is designed to fly close to terrain to avoid radardetection, and can carry conventional or nuclear warheads. It has arange of up to 1,500 miles.   When the government entered the case Feb. 15, the company askedthe judge to keep the lawsuit sealed. After hearing arguments on themotion Thursday, Judge David Kenyon ruled against the company.   An attorney for the whistleblowers, Herbert Hafif, said Northropsought to keep the lawsuit closed to protect its corporate image.   Northrop spokesman Tony Cantafio cited a November 1987 GeneralAccounting Office report stating the guidance system was ``reliableand will perform its intended mission.''   The corporation fired a plant manager and three employees afterthe aerospace firm ``discovered irregularities in the tests,''Cantafio added.   The lawsuit was filed in 1987 under the False Claims Act, whichallows whistleblowers to share damage awards with the government. Itwas joined by the Justice Department last month, a move thegovernment makes if it determines the allegations have merit.   The Air Force is ``evaluating the evidence in order to determinewhether corrective action needs to be taken to assure theirreliability,'' McMenimen said.   An attorney for the private plaintiffs, fired Northrop workersLeocadio Barajas and Patricia Meyer, said the workers were told tofalsify test results. The attorney, Rob Kilbourne, alleged the fakedtests mean the performance of the parts, called flight datarecorders, is suspect.   ``Northrop has delivered a guidance system for a nuclear weaponssystem that very well may not work if used. That is the bottomline,'' Kilbourne said.   The lawsuit alleges that Northrop falsely certified it hadperformed critical stress tests on flight data transmitters for1,764 missiles between 1981 and 1986. Los Angeles-based Northropsupplies the transmitters to Boeing Corp. of Seattle, which makesthe missiles.   Production of the $9,000-per-missile guidance systems started inEl Monte and moved later to Pomona, 20 miles east of downtown LosAngeles.   A federal grand jury in Los Angeles is conducting a separatecriminal investigation of the alleged fake tests, the Los AngelesTimes reported.   Northrop Vice Chairman Frank Lynch admitted during a 1987congressional hearing that the stress tests, designed to expose themto heat and cold to screen out defective units, were falsified andthat employees reported it to superiors.   ``Unfortunately, the manager of the plant was involved in thefalsification of tests,'' Lynch testified.   The U.S. Attorney's Office, entering the lawsuit, accusedNorthrop with breach of contract and fraud. The act allows thegovernment to seek $60 million, three times the actual damages, and$3 million in civil penalties, Ms. McMenimen said.   In the civil lawsuit filed Nov. 2, 1987, Barajas said he wasinstructed on what steps to take to make it appear the parts passedcertain tests.   Ms. Meyer, a quality control inspector for Northrop, said she wasfired after rejecting parts and materials that didn't conform toguidelines or were defective.</TEXT></DOC>
