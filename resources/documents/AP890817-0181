Mustin.   The deal, completed Friday, was made through a new company formedby Charterhouse Group International Inc., a New York company thatspecializes in leveraged buyouts.   The purchase price was not disclosed.   Paul Mullan, 43, former general manager at Leaf Inc., will bechairman of the new firm, Charter Confectionery Inc. Leaf makes MilkDuds candy, Clark candy bars and Donruss baseball cards.   Mullan said Wednesday he would move to Philadelphia from Illinoisto run Fleer. He said he wants to pursue aggressive growth ofFleer's confectionary products and trading card business, bothdomestically and internationally.   ``We're intending to build off the same management team,'' hesaid. ``Although there will be some changes.''   Charterhouse is owned by five European financial firms, one ofthem the Royal Bank of Scotland, and by two American principals,Merril M. Halpern and Jerome L. Katz.   Fleer, a family business founded in 1885 by German immigrants,has more than 500 employees. Besides its Philadelphia plant, Fleerhas operations in Spain, Germany, Canada and Morocco, Mustin said.Fleer had sales of more than $50 million in 1988, Mullan said.   A statement released by Fleer said the shareholders consideredtheir options and decided it was better to conclude a sale now thanto continue on as a family business. Topps Chewing Gum Inc., a majorcompetitor, was acquired in a similar deal six years ago. ForstmannLittle, another New York leveraged buyout specialist, arranged anall-cash purchase for $94.5 million.   Since it was founded in 1973, Charterhouse has engineered morethan 35 leveraged buyouts, including the 1988 takeover of EMI Co., afoundry in Erie.   It has also bought retailers and companies engaged intransportation parts, industrial batteries, graphic arts,engineering supplies, apparel and fashion accessories.   Mullan said Charter would borrow cash to pay Fleer stockholdersfor their shares, but he said the company would not assume the heavydebt that has marked some leveraged buyouts.   Mustin will become president of the company's internationaldivision, Mullan said. The deal has been approved by the FederalTrade Commission, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
