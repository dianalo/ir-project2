Long-term Treasury bonds declined about five-eighths of a point, or $6.25 for each $1,000 face amount. The yield on 30-year government bonds climbed to 9.07% from 9.01% last Friday. But that still is well below the nearly 9 1/2% level reached as recently as Aug. 25.    Several traders said they were surprised that bond prices failed to rally yesterday following a drop in the price of gold, one of the most closely watched barometers of inflation. Other commodity prices also fell without pulling bonds out of their slump.    &quot;I'm surprised that the market is as weak as it is,&quot; said Donald Sheahan, executive vice president at Nikko Securities Co. International Inc. Bruce Lakefield, executive vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc., said there wasn't any single factor accounting for yesterday's slump, adding: &quot;Volume was extremely light.&quot;    One factor cited by several traders as contributing to yesterday's weakness was nervousness about an inflation report to be released tomorrow. The government is expected to report that consumer prices rose 0.5% last month, following a 0.4% increase in July.    With inflation still viewed widely as a major threat, Federal Reserve officials probably won't ease their credit clamp any time this year, many analysts say. Most agree that the Fed's policy committee, which meets today in Washington, won't change policy just yet. But several analysts predict the Fed will push short-term rates slightly higher later this year in hopes of cooling the economy and restraining inflation pressures.    Jerry L. Jordan, a senior vice president at First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles, predicts that inflation will continue to accelerate. He anticipates a year-to-year increase in consumer prices of nearly 5% by the end of this year, followed by a rise of about 6% in 1989.    Mr. Jordan, a former member of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, also expects higher interest rates. In a memorandum prepared for a meeting of the Shadow Open Market Committee, a group of economists, he predicted that short-term interest rates could rise between one and 1.5 percentage points by the middle of next year.    The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds may rise to about 9 3/4% early next year &quot;before declining on expectations of lower future inflation and a weaker economy,&quot; Mr. Jordan contended.    Mr. Jordan and other members of the Shadow Open Market Committee renewed their long-running attack on Federal Reserve policies. The group of monetarist economists long have exhorted the Fed to deliver slow and steady reductions in money-supply growth. &quot;The root cause of inflation is monetary stimulus that is too rapid relative to the economy's capacity to produce,&quot; Mr. Jordan said.    Several bond traders attributed part of yesterday's slump to concern about the Treasury's borrowing needs. The Treasury tomorrow is expected to disclose plans to sell about $9 billion of new two-year notes and $7 billion of four-year notes next week.    Also, some analysts predict Congress soon will enact legislation that will allow the government to resume selling new long-term bonds. Those bonds could be part of the government's quarterly financing operation to be announced early in November. The government couldn't sell any new long-term bonds in its August financing because Congress hadn't acted to increase the government's authority to issue new long-term issues.    Treasury Securities   Nervousness about several government economic reports to be released later this week helped depress Treasury bond prices, traders said.    The latest 30-year Treasury bonds were quoted late in the day at 100 19/32, down 19/32 of a point from 101 6/32 Friday.    The government's latest 10-year notes fell to 101 25/32 from 102 3/32. Their yield rose to 8.97% from 8.93%.    Yields also rose slightly on shorter-term issues. The latest two-year notes yielded 8.42%, up from 8.38% Friday, while the yield on the government's 9% notes due in November 1993 rose to 8.69% from 8.65%.    Shearson Lehman Hutton's index of long-term Treasury bonds fell 5.52 points to 1236.63. It ranged between 1245.04 and 1236.31.    Rates on short-term Treasury bills were little changed from last Friday. However, at its regularly weekly auction yesterday, the Treasury sold new bills at lower rates than at last week's auction.    The average rate on new 13-week bills sold yesterday was 7.17%, down from 7.21% a week ago. The average rate on new 26-week bills declined to 7.34% from 7.41%.    Here are details:   Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.                                   13-Week           26-Week Applications ........... $29,302,080,000   $24,092,685,000 Accepted bids ........... $7,046,520,000    $7,007,345,000 Accepted at low price .............. 25%               95% Accepted noncompet'ly ..... $679,855,000      $529,020,000 Average price (Rate) ..... 98.188(7.17%)     96.289(7.34%) High price (Rate) ........ 98.190(7.16%)     96.304(7.31%) Low price (Rate) ......... 98.185(7.18%)     96.289(7.34%) Coupon equivalent ................ 7.40%             7.73%   Both issues are dated Sept. 22. The 13-week bills mature Dec. 22, and the 26-week bills mature March 23, 1989.   Foreign Bonds   West German and Japanese government bond prices rose yesterday, but British bonds drifted lower in light activity.   In Tokyo, bonds were bolstered by lower oil prices and continued stability in the foreign exchange markets. But high short-term money market rates limited the gains in bond prices, analysts said.   The Japanese government's benchmark No. 105, 5% bonds due 1997 closed in the interdealer market at a price of 99.37, up 0.16 yen per 100 yen face value. The yield was 5.10%, down 2.5 basis points from Friday. (A basis point is one one-hundredth of a percentage point.) The range on the session was 5.08% to 5.115%.   In West Germany, government bond prices advanced after Bonn announced that it will allow foreigners to purchase medium-term government obligations beginning Oct. 3. That is expected to increase demand for the issues significantly, traders said.   The West German government's benchmark 6 3/4% issue of 1998 closed the day at 101.00 to yield 6.606%, up 0.20 point on the day. Shorter-term maturities were quoted up 0.10 to 0.25 point on the day.   On the Euromark bond side, the Kingdom of Belgium's 5 1/2% issue of 1993 and Electricite de France's 6 1/8% issue of 1998 are both quoted 0.05 higher at 98.90 bid, 99.10 offered.   Traders say the market was quiet until Bonn's late-morning announcement, with foreign buying contributing much of the volume. The stronger market also brought a flurry of new issues, including a three-part, equity-linked issue from Volkswagen International Finance NV. a unit of Volkswagen AG.   In London, British government bonds, or gilts, ended 2/32 to 10/32 of a point lower in thin activity. For example, the benchmark Treasury 11 3/4 issue due 2003/2007 fell 10/32 to 112 10/32 to yield 9.98%.   Among shorter-term issues, the Treasury 11 3/4% issue due 1991 declined 3/32 point to 101 27/32 to yield 10.78%, while the Treasury 12% issue due 1995 fell 9/32 to 106 11/32 to yield 10.58%.   Prices drifted lower throughout the day on meager volume amid worries about the inflation outlook for the U.K. and expected further increases in base lending rates. U.K. base lending rates have been increased to 12% from 7 1/2% at the beginning of June in a series of moves by the government to express its determination to combat inflation.   Friday's news that the U.K. retail price index rose to an annual rate of 5.7% in August from 4.8% in July has increased speculation that base rates will rise further.   Paradoxically, though, higher interest rates have put upward pressure on U.K. inflation as mortgage rates rise in line with base rates. Mortgage costs are a component of the retail price index.   Today's scheduled release of U.K. money supply data are expected to show that sterling M-0, the narrow measure of the money supply, continued to grow outside the government's target ranges in August, while bank and building society lending eased from July's record level.   In the Eurobond market, several large new issues were offered. Among the issuers were General Electric Co. of the U.S. and a unit of Volkswagen.   GE's $500 million of 9 1/8%, five-year Eurobonds were underwritten by a group led by Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank N.V. Volkswagen's $120 million of 9 3/4%, 10-year bonds with equity-purchase warrants, led by Deutsche Bank Capital Markets, London, were part of a three-part offering, with portions also in deutsche marks and Swiss francs.   Seasoned Eurodollar issues ended unchanged to slightly lower in price, with spreads, or yield margins to U.S. Treasuries, widening slightly.   A secondary market specialist at a British house said retail investors seemed apathetic toward the market and may maintain light involvement until U.S. employment data are released Oct. 7.   Municipal Issues   Hurt by the Treasury bond market slump, prices of municipal bonds fell slightly yesterday.   Also, a large volume of new issues has hit the market in recent days, helping to depress prices. Among active issues, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% bonds of 2018 were at 92 3/4, down 1/4 point from Friday's close. The yield rose to 7.82% from 7.80% late Friday.   Separately, as previously reported, a rule that will reduce the supply of &quot;bearer bonds&quot; took effect yesterday. A bearer bond is one where the owner's name isn't on record.   Under a regulation passed by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, an industry regulatory group, most bearer bonds will be converted to registered form, in which the owner's name is on record, whenever a sale or trade is settled at the Depository Trust Co. Depository Trust is a national clearing house that handles the vast majority of municipal bond trades.   Some dealers say bearer bonds command a higher market price because of the anonymity they offer the holder. But bearer bonds are rapidly growing extinct because all new tax-free bonds issued after July 1983 were required by law to be in registered form. Government officials long have been eager to eliminate bearer bonds because of concern that such bonds were used to evade taxes.   Separately, Moody's Investors Service Inc. reinstated its Baa rating on the city of Yonkers, N.Y., general obligation bonds. The action, which traders say had little visible impact on the relatively thin secondary market for the issuer's paper, affects $96 million of debt outstanding.   Moody's had withdrawn its rating Aug. 4 &quot;due to uncertainties resulting from the daily fines imposed by the federal court&quot; after the Yonkers city council rejected a housing desegregation plan. With the council since having passed a zoning ordinance related to the plan, &quot;the city is no longer in contempt and the fines have been lifted,&quot; Moody's noted.   The Baa rating &quot;is based on the security derived from the set aside of property taxes with the state comptroller as fiscal agent for the purpose of meeting debt service requirements,&quot; Moody's said in a news release. Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. rates the city's general obligation bonds BBB.   Corporate Issues   Corporate bond prices were generally flat to off 1/4 point in light late trading.   Officials of Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., lead underwriter, confirmed late in the session that a recently priced $150 million seven-year note offering for American Brands Co. had been canceled. An American Brands spokesman said the offering was dropped &quot;because of the recent developments.&quot;   Late last week, New York investor Bennett LeBow asked for federal clearance to accumulate a stake in American Brands. Some analysts have suggested that American Brands may attempt to fend off LeBow's hostile overtures by buying Liggett Group Inc., a cigarette concern controlled by LeBow. But American Brands denies having any intention to purchase Liggett.   The American Brands spokesman had no comment when asked if the company planned to return to market with a similar offering in the future. Proceeds were intended to be used for general corporate purposes, primarily the refinancing of shorter-term, floating-rate debt.   The note issue was launched Sept. 13 and had been scheduled to close Tuesday.   Meanwhile, only one new issue came to market Monday and that was a $100 million five-year note offering for Dayton Hudson Corp.   Traders said the issue was priced as a 9 5/8% issue at par, a spread of 93 basis points above the rate of the Treasury five-year note. The notes are noncallable and are rated single-A-2 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and double-A-minus by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. In the secondary market, the debt securities of CSX Corp. fell sharply after the company announced a sweeping restructuring plan.   Traders said most investors were still trying to figure out how much the restructuring would impact the company's debt and that trading was light as a result.   Typically, though, they said the issues that did trade saw their yields jump 25 basis points. For example, the CSX's 9% securities of 2006 were being quoted late in the day at 10.25% bid, up from 10% bid on Friday.   Both major rating agencies said they were reviewing CSX debt securities and preferred for possible downgrading. The restructuring involves CSX buying back up to 60 million of its common shares and selling off some of its units.   Mortgage-Backed Securities   Ginnie Maes and other mortgage issues were 1/8 to 1/4 point lower in light trading.   Activity has shifted to trades for October delivery from dealings for September settlement because the five-day September settlement process has gotten under way.   The October Ginnie Mae 9% issue was quoted at 94 18/32, down 6/32; the 10% issue at 100 1/4, down 1/8; and Freddie Mac's 10% securities at 99 3/4, also down 1/8.   Ginnie Mae's 10% issue was yielding 10.09% to a 12-year average life. The spread above the 10-year Treasury note stood at 113 basis points, little changed from Friday.   Some traders expect the mortgage market to continue its strong performance relative to Treasury issues. They cite reduced issuance of mortgage securities, which is common during the late summer as lenders anticipate a decline in housing turnover. In addition, demand for derivative mortgage securities, particularly Remics, remains substantial. A Remic is a real estate mortgage investment conduit.   Activity in derivative mortgage and asset-backed markets was quiet after hectic dealings last week, when there was considerable new-issue business. Last week's new business included $1.5 billion of Remics, $650 million of securities backed by credit-card receivables, and $381 million of pass-throughs backed by boat loans.</TEXT></DOC>
