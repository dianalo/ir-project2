Even so, the company, based in Redmond, Wash., is stickingwith its earlier forecast for total retail sales of itsproducts to reach $4 billion in 1991. That's 18% aboveNintendo's 1990 retail sales level of $3.6 billion, but wellbelow the prior year's 27% growth rate. Peter Main, vicepresident marketing, declined to project profit, saying only:&quot;It's going to be a very strong year.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Retailers moved half a million units of the Super NintendoEntertainment System, or Super NES, between Aug. 22 and Oct.25. The company projects 2.2 million Super NES systems,priced at $199.95 each, and in excess of six million piecesof super-system software, selling for $50 to $60 each, willbe sold by Christmas.   &quot;It's very strong. There's no question about it,&quot; Mr. Mainsaid in a telephone interview. Nintendo predicted the SuperNES will be the best-selling toy this Christmas, vaulting thecompany into the lead spot in the two-year-old, 16-bit gamemarket.   By comparison, the 1989 launch of Nintendo's portable GameBoy player -- which sells for $89.95 -- saw one million unitssold at retail between August and Christmas, as well as threemillion pieces of related software at $20 apiece.   Nintendo also forecast retailers would sell four millionof its older eight-bit game systems and more than 40 millionpieces of related software during calendar 1991.   What isn't clear is how much the new Super NES mightcannibalize sales of older Nintendo game machines. Anotherunanswered question is whether, despite its fast start, theSuper NES will have the enduring popularity and long-termsales strength of the original system. The company clearlyhopes the new machine, with its enhanced power and crispergraphics, can restore its old sales-growth rates andre-ignite the cooling passion for video games.   Nintendo, the U.S. unit of Nintendo Co. Ltd. of Japan,which has dominated the video game market for several years,made its forecast at a meeting of toy industry securityanalysts yesterday in New York, where the company'scompetitors were also out in force. Atari Games Corp. andSega of America Inc. said they joined forces in an&quot;international alliance&quot; to develop and market popular arcadegame titles for all Sega video game systems in the U.S. andEurope.   Privately held Atari Games -- not to be confused withAtari Corp. -- is based in Milpitas, Calif., and marketsvideo game software through its Tengen Inc. label. Tengen,already one of Sega's third-party software developers, plansto introduce more than 40 software products for the Segasystems in the next 24 months under the new pact.</TEXT></DOC>
