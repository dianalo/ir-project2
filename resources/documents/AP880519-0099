GANS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A spell of cool, dry weather has helped IllinoisBell restore telephone service to thousands of customers in sixsuburbs west of Chicago whose phones went dead after a fire ravageda switching center, a company spokesman said.   Illinois Bell has advanced its target date from mid-June toearly June for restoring normal service to the 35,000 customers wholost all service after the May 8 fire, spokesman Larry Cose saidWednesday.   Illinois Bell expects to start connecting subscribers to a newdigital call switching system being installed at its Hinsdalecenter by May 26, instead of the original June 1 target date, Cosesaid. It normally takes 50 weeks to install such equipment underphone company guidelines.   ``The weather has been our friend the last couple of days,''Cose said. ``As long as it stays dry and cool, it's great for us;if it was wet and humid out there we'd probably be seeing moreproblems than we are seeing now.''   Hinsdale's weather _ with daytime temperatures in the 60s andnights in the 40s under clear skies _ has been good for the 250employees working 24 hours a day to repair or replace old equipmentand install the new switching system.   The cool, dry weather has reduced problems with corrosion of oldswitching equipment badly damaged in the fire. As a result, Cosesaid, Bell officials are using the old equipment to restore partialservice to customers until the new system is installed.   Twenty dehumidifiers also have been set up to prevent corrosionof the old equipment.   By Thursday, the company had restored partial service to 31,000of the 35,000 customers whose service was cut off by the fire, Cosesaid.   By the end of the week, all 35,000 subscribers in the Hinsdalearea should have limited service, with irregular dial tones andcrackling on the lines, Cose said. The technical problems willcontinue until the customers are hooked up to the new switchingequipment, he said.   As partial service is restored, many would-be callers haveencountered delays because of heavy demand.   ``It's like a jam getting on the expressway during the rushhour,'' Cose said. ``But the situation is better than it wasyesterday.''   Bell expects that regional and long distance lines and specialbusiness lines transmitting computer data that were routed throughthe Hinsdale center should be functioning normally by the end ofthe week, Cose said.   More than 125 coin-operated telephones were set up around thewestern suburbs, the company said. Many businesses that rely ontelephone orders have been suffering from lagging sales, and onehospital started using pizza trucks to make birth announcements.   Meanwhile, volunteer workers continued to staff mobile emergencyreporting patrols in the six suburbs to relay calls for police,fire or medical services.   Hinsdale Village Manager Ron Ruskey said 19 emergency vehicleswould be on the street until the town was sure all local phoneswere operating.   A Naperville company, Angels International Travel Inc., filed alawsuit seeking class-action status and unspecified damages in DuPage County Circuit Court for what it said was Bell's failure toprotect properly against the fire.   Richard Janney, vice president and general counsel for IllinoisBell, said the company will give double credit to customers whohave been without service. Bell has said it believes it isprotected from legal damages under state law.   Sam Mitchell, of the Chicago Association of Commerce andIndustry, said it might take months to determine the financiallosses caused by the phone outage.</TEXT></DOC>
