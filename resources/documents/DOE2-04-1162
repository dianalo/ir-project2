The analysis of these samples, whichcontain both radioactive and hazardous materials, using EPA methods requiresthat both the sample collection and the analytical analysis be performedusing guidelines and precautions different from those normally used forradioanalytical work. The paper discusses the unique procedures, guidelines,and precautions one must use in collecting and analyzing mixed wastesamples in order to achieve accurate and reliable results and reportsthe recent experience of International Technology (IT) Corporation inconstructing and operating a mixed waste laboratory. It also describesthe experience of IT personnel in collecting samples in the field.</TEXT></DOC>
