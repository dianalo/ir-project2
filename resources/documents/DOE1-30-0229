First, are the design of the main architectureof the expert system and the identification of the functions which mustbe assigned to the different expert modules or blocks. Second, is thedefinition of the knowledge mechanisms and their representation in termsof rules and metarules. Third, is the preparation of prototypes for theexpert modules and their testing. As the fourth step, are the designand enactment of a capability for controlling the interconnections amongthe expert modules to make information flows compatible and to optimizethe operation of the whole system.</TEXT></DOC>
