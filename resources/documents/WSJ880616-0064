Mobil Chemical Co. said Babcock andamp; Wilcox Co., the New Orleans, La.-based heavy equipment maker, will study the feasibility of segregating consumer plastics from other solid wastes and converting them to a form that will burn in the small plants typically used by college campuses, hospitals, municipal buildings and industrial parks.    Mobil Chemical, a major plastics producer, declined to disclose the cost of the four-month study, which it claims will be the first comprehensive review of existing plastic-incineration technologies. The plastics industry in recent years has been increasing research and development on the growing solid-waste disposal problems facing the country.    Fred Siemer, a New York chemicals analyst, suggested Mobil was making another in a series of moves to keep one step ahead of environmentalists.    Mobil Chemical said there are numerous engineering problems to overcome in devising an incineration plan for small plants. &quot;Plastics burn great under massincineration situations, but the issue is how to put it in a form that can burn effectively in small plants,&quot; a spokesman for the unit said.    Some analysts said the bigger issue involves collecting the plastics in the first place.    &quot;The real trick is developing a mechanism for recovering the plastic,&quot; said Ted Semegran, a chemical analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. Mr. Semegran added that the only feasible way now available to recover consumer plastic waste is through the bottle deposit laws that have been adopted by 10 states. </TEXT></DOC>
