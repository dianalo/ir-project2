To this end, Rule 4.8 is restructuredto include all provisions generally relating to fees and fee waivers foragency records. Other provisions of the current rule, which pertain onlyto public records, are moved to Rule 4.9.In addition to changes pertaining to fees and fee waivers, the proposedrule incorporates changes to conform Rule 4.10 (``Nonpublic records'')to the provisions of the Reform Act that expand the exemption for investigativerecords, and that create new categories for records that are not subjectto the FOIA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments will be received until September 8, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Comments should be addressed to the Secretary, FederalTrade Commission, Sixth Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington,DC 20580.Comments will be entered on the public record of the Commission and willbe available for public inspection in Room 130 at the above address duringthe hours of 9:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Keith Golden, Information ServicesDivision, Federal Trade Commission, 6th andamp; Pennsylvania Avenue, NW.,Washington, DC 20580, (202) 326-2410.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2><ITAG tagnum="84">I. Fees and Fee Waivers.</ITAG>Under the proposed rule, all fee and fee waiver provisions generally applicableto requests for Commission records will appear in Rule 4.8; thus, certainprovisions now embodied in Rule 4.11(a)(i)(1) will be incorporated intoRule 4.8. On the other hand, subsections (a) and (b) of Rule 4.8 (whichare specifically applicable to public records) will be moved, in amendedform, to Rule 4.9.The Commission previously proposed changes to its fee and fee waiver provisionsin 1986. 51 FR 32657. The 1986 proposal preceded and thus did not reflectthe amendments to the FOIA fee and fee waiver provisions contained in theReform Act. The Commission is therefore publishing this new proposal, reflectingboth the 1986 amendments, Pub. L. 99-570, sections 1801-1804, and the guidelinespromulgated by the Office of Management and Budget, 52 FR 10012-10020,for an additional comment period.A. <T3>Proposed Rule 4.8(a). </T3>Proposed Rule 4.8(a) defines the terms ``search,''``duplication,'' ``review,'' and ``direct costs,'' consistent with theamended FOIA and OMB Guideline 6, 52 FR 10017.B. <T3>Proposed Rule 4.8(b)(1)-(3). </T3>These provisions define four categoriesof requesters (commercial use requesters, educational requesters, non-commercialscientific institution requesters, and representatives of the news media),and establish a residual category for other requesters. The proposed definitionsof the categories of requesters are consistent with the amended FOIA andOMB Guideline 6, 52 FR 10017-18. Consistent with the amended FOIA, theprovisions also prescribe types of charge that will be imposed on eachtype of requester, and on requesters who fall into none of the categories.5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)(ii), 552(a)(4)(A)(ii).C. <T3>Proposed Rule 4.8(b)(4). </T3>Proposed Rule 4.8(b)(4) provides thatcharges that do not exceed $5.00 will be waived. A waiver provision ofthis nature is mandated by the amended FOIA, which requires a waiver ``ifthe costs of routine collection or processing of the fee are likely toequal or exceed the amount of the fee.'' 5 U.S.C. 554(a)(4)(A)(iv)(I).<T3>See also</T3> OMB Guideline 7.f., 52 FR 10018-19. The $5.00 thresholdis based on past Commission experience respecting the cost of assessingand collecting fees.The current rule also contains a minimum fee provision, which providesthat all charges that do not exceed a $10.00 threshold will be waived.16 CFR 4.8(c)(1). The new provision will operate somewhat differently.Under the proposed rule, charges will be waived based only if that totalcost is below the threshold (now $5.00). Thus, if total costs are $5.00,the requester will be billed nothing; on the other hand, if total costsare $6.00, the full amount will be billed.D. <T3>Proposed Rule 4.8(b)(5). </T3>Proposed Rule 4.8(b)(5) provides thatcertain materials may be made available to all requesters without charge,and is consistent with current Rule 4.8(b), 16 CFR 4.8(b). For example,the Commission prints a number of copies of its decisions when they areissued. These decisions will be distributed without charge, to FOIA orother requesters, until the initial supply is exhausted.E. <T3>Proposed Rule 4.8(b)(6). </T3>This provision, which establishes specificfees that will be charged to requesters under the FOIA, substantially revisesthe fee schedule in Rule 4.8(c)(2) of the current rule, 16 CFR 4.8(c)(2).Certain fees are raised to reflect increased costs; others are reducedto reflect diminished costs. Also, a new fee category is established forExpress Mail Service, a service that will be available on request.Consistent with existing Commission practice, most fees are described bya specific dollar figure. However, to increase flexibility in administeringthe fee provisions, search and review fees are described by a formula:quarter-hourly fees will be established for three categories of employees(clerical, attorney/economist, and other professional), based on the avergepay of employees in each class, increased by a 16 percent factor to reflectthe cost of additional benefits accorded government employees. This formulais consistent with the OMB Guideline 7.a, 52 FR 10018 (providing for 16percent adjustment to salary, and authorizing the use of an average rate).Further, the use of a formula in the text of the rule, as opposed to aspecific dollar figure, is consistent with the practice of other agencies.<T3>See, e.g., </T3>5 CFR 1303.40 (OMB regulations). The current hourlyfees for attorneys/economists, other professionals, and paralegals are$13.25, $6.15, and $5.50, respectfully. Under the proposed rule, they willrise to approximately $32.10, $23.70, and $13.20, respectfully.F. <T3>Proposed Rule 4.8(c). </T3>Proposed Rule 4.8(c) provides that eachpublic request for records should set forth whether the request is madefor other than commercial purposes and whether the requester is an educationalinstitution, a noncommercial scientific institution, or a representativeof the news media. This information will enable the Deputy Executive Directorinitially, or the General Counsel or Commission on appeal, to apply thenew fee provisions. If the information is lacking in a written request,the decisionmaker may use additional information provided by the requester,and any other relevant information, to determine the proper fee classification.When a request is made orally, the relevant information may be providedorally.G. <T3>Proposed Rule 4.8(d). </T3>Proposed Rule 4.8(d) requires, with oneexception, that an agreement to pay fees accompany all requests. The agreementmay assert that the requester shall pay any fees that are incurred, orit may be limited to a specific dollar amount. The one exception is that,when a requester applies for a fee waiver, the request may state that therequester is unwilling to pay fees if the waiver is denied.If such an agreement is lacking, and if the estimated fees exceed $25.00,the requester will be advised of the estimated fees and the request willnot be processed until the requester agrees to pay the fees. The $25.00figure in the proposed rule provision is consistent with the OMB Guidelinesfor notification to a requester who has not agreed to pay charges. <T3>See </T3>Guideline 7.d (notice when duplication charges are likelyto exceed $25.00); Guideline 9.a. (notice when search charges are likelyto exceed $25.00). It is also consistent with Rule 4.11(a)(1)(i)(D) ofthe current rules of practice but, unlike the current rule, the proposedrule does not require that the agreement be in writing, and the provisionis expressly applicable to all record requests from the public, and notonly to requests under the FOIA.H. <T3>Proposed Rule 4.8(e). </T3>Proposed Rule 4.8(e) provides for fee waiversin the public interest. The proposed rule describes the procedures to requesta waiver, and sets forth a six-part test for fee waivers, similar to thesix-part tests established by numerous other agencies. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>28 CFR 16.10(d) (Department of Justice); 49 CFR 7.97(d)(Department of Transportation).The six-part test is based on two statutory standards under the ReformAct, which provide respectively that a fee waiver will be granted (1) ``ifdisclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likelyto contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations oractivities of the government,'' and, (2) if disclosure ``is not primarilyin the commercial interest of the requester.'' The first four parts ofthe proposed six-part test are based closely on the first of these statutoryprovisions; the last two parts of the proposed six-part test are basedclosely on the second statutory provision.The fee waiver provisions, like the other provisions of Proposed Rule 4.8,apply to requests for public records as well as requests for nonpublicrecords. As a practical matter, public records are readily available atthe Commission's headquarters and, to a lesser extent, its regional offices,and fee waivers will rarely be granted for public records. However, theCommission believes that the fee waiver standards could be met by a requesterwho seeks public records, although the requester would have to show whythe waiver would satisfy the relevant standards, including particularlythe standard in Rule 4.8(e)(2)(i)(D), notwithstanding that the documentsare already available to both the requester and the general public.I. <T3>Proposed Rule 4.8(f). </T3>Proposed Rule 4.8(f) provides that feesmay be charged for an unsuccesful search, i.e., a search in which no documentsor only exempt documents were located. OMB Guideline 1, 52 FR 10017, specificallynotes a Congressional intent that agencies recover their costs, and OMBGuideline 7.a, 52 FR 10019, specifically provides for recovering costsof unsuccessful searches. Consistent with this Guideline, Proposed Rule4.8(d), discussed above, contains guidelines to insure that requestersconsent to payment of fees when estimated costs exceed $25.00, and willoperate to assure that requesters will be aware of possible charges foran unsuccessful search.Consistent with OMB Guideline 7.a, the proposed rule states only that charges<T3>may </T3>be imposed for an unsuccessful search. Nevertheless, it isthe Commission's intent that these charges generally will be imposed, exceptin unusual cases. Charges for unsuccessful searches, of course, will besubject to limitations applicable to all charges; i.e., requesters (otherthan commercial use requesters) will not be charged for the first two hoursof search time (Proposed Rule 4.8(b) (2) and (3)), and requesters willnot be billed if the total chargeable fees do not exceed $5.00 (ProposedRule 4.8(b)(4)).J. <T3>Proposed Rule 4.8(g). </T3>This provision authorizes aggregation ofrequests for purposes of determining the applicable fee. The Deputy ExecutiveDirector for Planning and Information (DEDPI) initially, or the GeneralCounsel on appeal, may aggregate requests for purposes of fees when theDEDPI or General Counsel determines that a requester or a group of requestersis attempting to evade fees by dividing a single request into a seriesof smaller requests. <T3>See </T3>OMB Guideline 9.c, 52 FR 10019-20.K. <T3>Proposed Rule 4.8(h). </T3>Proposed Rule 4.8(h) provides that the DEDPIor General Counsel may require advance payment of estimated fees that arelikely to exceed $250. Advance payment may also be required when a requesterhas failed to pay a previous bill in a timely fashion. In appropriate circumstances,requesters may also be required to pay prior unpaid bills, including accruedinterest, before a new request is processed. The proposed Rule is basedon the amended FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)(v), and OMB Guideline 9.d, 52FR 110020.L. <T3>Proposed Rule 4.8(i).</T3> Proposed Rule 4.8(i) authorizes the useof credit cards, in addition to checks or money orders payable to the U.S.Treasury, as an alternative method of paying fees imposed by the Rule.M. <T3>Proposed Rule 4.8(j). </T3>Consistent with OMB Guideline 9.a, 52 FR10018, the proposed Rule provides that interest charges may be assessedstarting on the 31st day after a bill is sent.N. <T3>Proposed Rule 4.8(k). </T3>As provided by OMB Guideline 9.e, 52 FR10029, Proposed Rule 4.8(k) authorizes use of the Debt Collection Act of1982, Pub. L. 97-365, to collect unpaid fees.O. <T3>Proposed Rule 4.9.(a)(4). </T3>Proposed Rule 4.9(a)(4), like Rule 4.8(b)of the current rules, 16 CFR 4.8(b), provides for copying of public records.The provision is moved to Rule 4.9, which now contains all provisions relatinggenerally to public records. The provision makes explicit that costs willbe imposed for all requests for public records to the same extent thatthey would be imposed for FOIA requests.Subsection (ii) cross-references three provisions of Proposed Rule 4.8,to highlight to requesters the availability of fee waivers, the need toprovide information to determine fees, and the need to agree to pay fees.Subsection (iii) provides that records for sale at another government agencywill not be provided to requesters under this section. This provision conformsthe rules with section (a)(4)(A)(6) of the amended FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)(6).<T3>See also </T3>OMB Guideline 6.b., 7, 52 FR 10017-18.P. <T3>Proposed Rule 4.11(a)(1)(i). </T3>Subsections (C), (D), and (E) ofthe rule are proposed to be amended.Subsection (C) of the Proposed Rule contains cross-references to fee andfee waiver provisions that appear in Rule 4.11 of the current rule andthat, in the proposed rule, are amended and transferred to Rule 4.8.Subsection (D) provides that FOIA requests will not be deemed to be receiveduntil a requester agrees to pay fees, and that the request will be deniedif the requester refuses to pay fees and is not granted a fee waiver. Theprovision delaying the date when a request will be deemed to be receivedis similar to provisions in subsections (D) and (E) of the current ruleand is consistant with section (a)(3) of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3) (agencywill provide records in response to a request that ``is made in accordancewith published rules stating the time, place, fees (if any), and proceduresto be followed.'') Since the provision requires an <T3>agreement </T3>to pay, and not actual payment, it is not inconsistentwith section (a)(4)(A)(5) of the amended FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)(5),which limits the authority of agencies to demand advance payments.Subsection (E), which parallels Rule 4.9(a)(4)(iii), provides that theCommission will not produce copies of documents under the FOIA if the documentsare available for sale from another agency.Q. <T3>Proposed Rule 4.11(d). </T3>Rule 4.11(d) governs requests from othergovernment agencies seeking documents for purposes other than law enforcement.The proposed amendment would apply the fee and fee waiver provisions ofProposed Rule 4.8 to such requests. The Commission proposed a similar changein 1986. 51 FR 32657.These cost provisions would not apply to requests that are made for lawenforcement purposes under Rule 4.11(c), 16 CFR 4.11(c). Also, as withother non-commercial requesters, government requesters under this provisionwill not be charged for two hours of search time and 100 pages of reproduction,nor will they be charged if their bill does not exceed $5.00. Furthermore,fee waivers will be available to government requesters in appropriate cases,even if they do not have a law enforcement purpose.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Nonpublic Records</ITAG>The Reform Act amended the FOIA's exemption from disclosure for law enforcementrecords. 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7) (Exemption 7). Proposed Rule 4.10(a)(5) amendsthe provision of the Commission's rules relating to Exemption 7.Also, Proposed Rule 4.10(a)(11) incorporates the ``exclusion'' in section(c)(1) of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(c)(1), which provides that the statute'sdisclosure provisions are not applicable if (1) the records are law enforcementrecords, (2) the records relate to a pending investigation or proceedingthat involves a possible violation of criminal law, (3) there is reasonto believe that the subject is not aware of the pendency of the investigationor proceeding, and (4) disclosure of the existence of the records couldreasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings. Thisprovision would apply to records held by the Commission that contain informationabout potential criminal violations that may be referred to the Departmentof Justice for further prosecution. <T3>Attorney General's Memorandum on the 1986 Amendments to the Freedomof Information Act </T3>(Dec. 1987), at 20 and n.37. In responding to anFOIA request, the agency can simply treat these records as if they do notexist, and advise the requester that there are no responsive documents.<T3>Id. </T3>at 27.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 16 CFR Part 4</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Freedom of Information Act.In consideration of the foregoing, the Commission proposes to amend Title16, Chapter I, Subchapter A of the Code of Federal Regulations, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 4_MISCELLANEOUS RULES</ITAG>1. The authority for Part 4 continues to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>Sec. 6, 38 Stat. 721; 15 U.S.C. 46.</ITAG>2.

Section 4.8 is revised to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 4.8 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Costs for obtaining Commission records.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Definitions. </T3>For the purpose of this section:(1) The term ``search'' includes all time spent looking for material thatis responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identificationof material within documents.(2) The term ``duplication'' refers to the process of making a copy ofa document in order to respond to a request for Commission records.(3) The term ``review'' refers to the examination of documents locatedin response to a request to determine whether any portion of such documentsmay be withheld, and the redaction or other processing of documents fordisclosure. Review does not include time spent resolving general legalor policy issues regarding the release of the document.(4) The term ``direct costs'' means expenditures that the Commission actuallyincurs in processing requests. Not included in direct costs are overheadexpenses such as costs of document review facilities or the costs of heatingor lighting such a facility or other facilities in which records are stored.The direct costs of specific services are set forth in andSection; 4.8(b)(6).(b) <T3>Fees. </T3>User fees pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 483(a) and 5 U.S.C. 552(a)will be charged according to this paragraph.(1) <T3>Commercial use requesters. </T3>Commercial use requesters will be chargedfor the direct costs to search for, review, and duplicate documents. Acommercial use requester is a requester who seeks information for a useor purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests ofthe requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made.(2) <T3>Educational requesters, non-commercial scientific institution requesters,and representatives of the news media. </T3>Requesters in these categorieswill be charged for the direct costs to duplicate documents, excludingcharges for the first 100 pages. An ``educational institution'' is a preschool,a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduatehigher education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, aninstitution of professional education, and an institution of vocationaleducation, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.A ``non-commercial scientific institution'' is an institution that is notoperated on a ``commercial'' basis as that term is referenced in paragraph(b)(1) of this section, and that is operated solely to conduct scientificresearch the results of which are not intended to promote any particularproduct or industry. A ``representative of the news media'' is any personactively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated topublish or broadcast news to the public. ``News'' means information thatis about current events or that would be of current interest to the public.(3) <T3>Other requesters. </T3>Other requesters will be charged for the directcosts to search for and duplicate documents, except that the first 100pages of duplication and the first two hours of search time will be furnishedwithout charge.(4) <T3>Waiver of small charges. </T3>Charges will be waived if the total chargeablefees for a request do not exceed $5.00.(5) <T3>Materials available without charge. </T3>These provisions do not applyto recent Commission decisions and other materials that may be made availableto all requesters without charge while supplies last.(6) <T3>Schedule of direct costs. </T3>The following uniform schedule of feesapplies to records held by all constituent units of the Commission.<ITAG tagnum="84">Duplication</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,tp0,p0,8/9,g1,t1,i1,s50,xls76</C> <H1> </H1><H1> </H1>Paper Copy (up to 8\1/2\andmin172;andmin172; X 14andmin172;andmin172;)<ITAG tagnum="2">(Reproduced by Commission staff) <D>$0.14 per page.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">(Reproduced by Requester) <D>$0.05 per page.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Computer Paper <D>$0.14 per page.</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Microfilm Services</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,tp0,p0,8/9,g1,t1,i1,s50,xls76</C> <H1> </H1><H1> </H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Film Copy_Paper to 16mm film <D>$0.02 per frame.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Fiche Copy_Paper to 105mm fiche <D>$0.02 per frame.</D><P>+$0.23 per fiche.</P></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Film Copy_Duplication of existing 100 ft. roll of 16mm film. <D>$3.35 per roll.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Fiche Copy_Duplication of existing 105mm fiche <D>$0.04 per fiche.</D></ITAG>Paper Copy_Converting existing 16mm film to paper<ITAG tagnum="2">(Conversion by Commission Staff) <D>$0.23 per page.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">(Conversion by Requester) <D>$0.14 per page.</D></ITAG>Paper Copy_Converting existing 105mm fiche to paper<ITAG tagnum="2">(Conversion by Commission Staff) <D>$0.23 per page.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">(Conversion by Requester) <D>$0.14 per page.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Film Cassettes <D>$3.60 per cassette.</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Other Charges</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,tp0,p0,8/9,g1,t1,i1,s50,xls76</C> <H1> </H1><H1> </H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Computer Tape <D>$18.50 per tape.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Certification <D>$10.35 each.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Express Mail <D>$5.00 for the first pound and $.89 for each additional pound (per request).</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Search and Review Fees</ITAG>Agency staff is divded into three categories: clerical, attorney/economist,and other professional.

The requestershall explain why a waiver is appropriate under the standards set forthin this paragraph. The application shall also include a statement, as providedby paragraph (d) of this section, of whether the requester agrees to paycosts if the waiver is denied. The Deputy Executive Director initially,and the General Counsel or Commission on appeal, will rule on applicationsfor fee waivers.(2) <T3>Standards.</T3> (i) The first requirement for a fee waiver is thatdisclosure will likely contribute significantly to public understandingof the operations or activities of the government. This requirement shallbe met if:(A) The subject matter of the requested information concerns the operationsor activities of the Federal government;(B) The disclosure is likely to contribute to an understanding of theseoperations or activities; (C) The understanding to which disclosure is likely to contribute is theunderstanding of the public at large, as opposed to the understanding ofthe individual requester or a narrow segment of interested persons; and(D) The likely contribution to public understanding will be significant.(ii) The second requirement for a fee waiver is that the request not beprimarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Satisfaction ofthis requirement shall be determined by considering:(A) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furtheredby the requested disclosure; and(B) If so, whether the public interest in disclosure is outweighed by theindentified commercial interest of the requester so as to render the disclosureprimarily in the requester's commercial interest.(f) <T3>Unsuccessful searches.</T3> Charges may be assessed for search timeeven if the agency fails to locate any responsive records or if it locatesonly records that are determined to be exempt from disclosure.(g) <T3>Aggregating requests.</T3> If the Deputy Executive Director for Planningand Information initially, or the General Counsel or Commission on appeal,reasonably believes that a requester, or a group of requesters acting inconcert, is attempting to evade an assessment of fees by dividing a singlerequest into a series of smaller requests, the requests may be aggregatedand fees charged accordingly.(h) <T3>Advance payment.</T3> If the Deputy Executive Director for Planningand Information initially, or the General Counsel or Commission on appeal,estimates or determines that allowable charges that a requester may berequired to pay are likely to exceed $250.00, or if the requester has previouslyfailed to pay a fee within 30 days of the date of billing, the requestermay be required to pay some or all of the total estimated charge in advance.Further, the requester may be required to pay all unpaid bills, includingaccrued, interest, prior to processing the request.(i) <T3>Means of payment.</T3> Payment shall be made by check or money orderpayable to the Treasury of the United States, or by credit card. Proceduresfor paying fees by credit card are available from the Public ReferenceSection, Federal Trade Commission, Sixth Street and Pennsylvania AvenueNW., Washington, DC 20580; (202) 326-2222.(j) <T3>Interest charges.</T3> The Commission will begin assessing interestcharges on an unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the day onwhich the bill was sent. Interest will accrue from the date of the billing,and will be calculated at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717.(k) <T3>Effect of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 </T3>(<T3>pub. L. 97-365</T3>).
