Before the opening the Labor Department reported that thecivilian unemployment rate dropped to 5.2 percent in July from 5.3percent the month before.   Nonfarm payroll employment increased by 169,000, on top of anupward-revised 250,000 gain in June.   The figures were interpreted as evidence of persistent strengthin the economy, suggesting that the Federal Reserve might seelittle need to relax its credit policy further any time soon.   Interest rates jumped in the credit markets. Prices of long-termgovernment bonds fell more than $20 for each $1,000 in face value,pushing their yields back above 8 percent.   The reaction in the stock market was less emphatic, however.While the news was a negative for interest rates, brokers said, italso helped to ease recent worries about a possible recession.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
