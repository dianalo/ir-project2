Analysts and spokesmen for both companies said in similar situations in the past, once a drug is approved by the Food and Drug Administration, it goes on the market even if its makers are fighting over patent rights in court.    As previously reported, Genetics said this week it was issued a patent on a pure form of erythropoietin, or EPO, a drug used to combat anemia in people with kidney disease.    In Thousand Oaks, Calif., Amgen, which is ahead of Genetics in clinical trials of the drug, said yesterday that it still expects to win &quot;the dominant patent rights&quot; for making EPO, and the right with its partners &quot;to market the product exclusively on a world-wide basis.&quot;    &quot;All of the cards haven't been played yet,&quot; said Philip J. Whitcome, Amgen's director of strategic planning. &quot;We have applications that are in the patent office that we think will be broad in their coverage.&quot;    Mr. Whitcome wouldn't elaborate, but both biotechnology companies are seeking patents covering the process of genetically engineering EPO.    Mr. Whitcome said Amgen expects to seek FDA approval to begin commercial use of EPO later this year or early next year.    Kathy Behrens, an analyst with Robertson, Colman andamp; Stephens in San Francisco, said she expects Amgen's product to be on the market in the second half of 1988.    In Cambridge, Mass., Bruce M. Eisen, chief patent counsel for Genetics, said he doesn't expect FDA approval for commercial use of his company's EPO product in the U.S. before 1989. It may be available earlier overseas, he said.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Amgen shares closed at $32.50, up $1; Genetics closed at $35, down $1.25. </TEXT></DOC>
