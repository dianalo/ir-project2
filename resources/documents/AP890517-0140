Fifteen homes and an apartment complex were destroyed in thetown of 1,000 people 40 miles from Austin.   ``All we have left is our lives,'' said W.G.

It waslike hell, that's what it was like,'' said Jerry Waters, who livedin the building.   Sheriff Jim Boutwell said it appeared that more than one tornadotouched down because there were some parallel areas of damage.   A 42-year-old woman died of a broken neck when the tornado hither mobile home, which Boutwell said ``practically exploded.''Hospitals in Georgetown and Temple reported 24 people soughttreatment.   Kelly Reichenbach said he and his wife, Earline, and their1-year-old son, Kyle, dived for cover in the hallway of their homewhen they heard the wind roaring.   ``Your main concern was trying to find out what was landing ontop of you,'' said Reichenbach, who received stitches in his legfor a gash caused by falling debris. ``There were wires on us. Wejust pushed them off.''   Floodwaters in the Dallas area, which got nearly six inches ofrain in less than 24 hours, sent hundreds of residents to shelters.Police, firefighters and others rescued scores of people from cars,homes and in one case, a tree.   ``I've been standing in water up to my elbows for the lastcouple hours trying to get a couple gals out of a tree,'' saidKennedale Police Chief David Geeslin.   He said the women had been stuck in the tree for eight hoursafter their car was washed off the roadway.   Another rescue attempt ended in tragedy. Firefighters, securedwith ropes strung to telephone poles, spent 2{ hours trying toreach a woman whose car was swept off a bridge into a Dallas creek.The woman waited atop the car.   ``The car started rocking and she got back into the car and atthat time the car fell into the creek. It floated for a few minutesand went down,'' said firefighter Dennis Ground. Her body was founda half-mile away.   In suburban Grand Prairie, the body of an elderly man wasrecovered from a truck in a creek, said police Lt. James Gatlin.   A Kennedale city councilman used his boat to rescue a man whohad gone to check his cattle and became trapped by rising waters,Geeslin said.
