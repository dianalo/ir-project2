(Kalamazoo,Mich.) and Merck Sharp andamp; Dohme (West Point, Pa.), for example, receive drugtesting information from so many different sources and in so many forms it'snot realistic for them to standardize.andP;  Other users, such as the AlabamaDept.andP;  of Environmental Management, interact with mon-and-pop-type operationsthat have no interest in computerization, says Walter Corbitt, chief of ISfor the department.andP;  Most end users who are eyeing the elimination of paperare proceeding cautiously until the technology has passed a legal litmustest, though there is little reason to believe that it will fail (see &quot;TheLegality of Digitized Documents: A Red Herring?&quot;).andP;  Meanwhile, many retainingtheir paper files to ensure they are not placed at a disadvantage shouldlegal barriers arise, while others are keeping their files for their owncomfort.andM;The legal issue aside, the attraction of the technology--particularlycompared with paper-based systems and microfilm--is undeniable (sse &quot;HowGlaxo Chose a System&quot;).andP;  Higher productivity, competitive advantage, andproduct differentiation are some of the benefits that are accruing to users.andO;And for dozens of applications in insurance, financial services, healthservices, and law, quick access to original documents provides a qualitativeboost to business and, in particular, to customer service operations.andM;&quot;We used to have just paper files, so the whole task of file management [withthe imaging system, compared to paper] is night and day,&quot; says ClaudetteCofta, manager of distribution safety programs for the Chemical ManufacturersAssociation, Washington, D.C.andP;  &quot;The communicators were getting busier andbusier; they used to average a little over five minutes to retrieve an MSDS[Materials Safety Data Sheet], and the situation was deteriorating becausethe library was getting bigger and bigger.andP;  Now the average is 12 seconds to15 seconds, and they are far more successful in finding the document.&quot;andM;But while the benefits are tangible, there are also challenges.andP;  And one ofthe most significant issues for users to deal with is the integration ofimage with conventional information systems and communications networks.andM;Architecturally, the systems that are being installed today are still largelystandalone, though the clear trend is toward integrating them with existingstandard information systems.andM;At Advest, automating the microfilm system &quot;would have improved our lookupcapabilities, but would still have required that we input data separatelyinto the microfilm system and the mainframe,c says systems vp Sullivan.andO;Instead, the firm linked its system from LaserData, Lowell, Mass., andGlastonbury, Conn.-based DataImage Inc. (the integrator on the prlject) to anaccount database on its Honeywell DPS 870 mainframe.andP;  The link passes anightly document activity report to the mainframe, which contains indexingdata keyed in from incoming documents.andP;  The mainframe then posts all updatesto the account files in its database and is able to determine, by account,what documents have been received and when.andM;Users of U.S.andP;  Trust's PC-based document management system from NewYork-based AGA Inc. can access the company's 3090 mainframe for balances andportfolio information, transactional and security histories, customerinformation files, and account relationships.andP;  The bank had to upgrade themonitors and memory of its existing 286- and 386-based PC/ATs before theycould process image data.andP;  Now U.S.andP;  Trust plans to integrate further thePC-based system with its asset management system on the 3090.andP;  &quot;It willbecome part of our overall client management facilities,&quot; says John Cleary,vice president of strategic planning, Computer Services Division.andM;Dave Mack, vice president of consulting at Yankee Group, notes that,particularly for banks looking at enterprisewide applications, the inabilityof the various document imaging systems to integrate with each other willbecome increasingly debilitating.andM;Whether a system is standalone or integrated, document image data cannot beadded to an existing information system merely as another data type.andP;  Itsspecial requirements encompass workstations, with their need forhigh-resolution monitors, extra memory, special software, and, mostsignificantly, both local and wide area communications.andM;Says Scott McCready, director of image management systems service at CAPInternational, a Norwell, Mass.-based consultancy, &quot;There are the questionsof &quot;Do you want to run data and image over the same network?' or 'If you havea mainframe do you want to use it as an image controller?'andP;  The difficulty ofusing installed equpment is that you have to determine at what level ofcapacity it is performing and where the peaks are.andM;&quot;Normally that capacity is only what you have left over during peak periods,because peaks for the data system are likely to be the same as they are forimage systems.andP;  You also have to look at how highly tuned the processor andthe network are.andP;  If the processor is turned for data-oriented functions, youdon't want to fool with it to try and deal with image.&quot;andM;In the Orange County Public Schools system in Orlando, Fla., Bob Ryner,administrator of image systems, found that though the school needed to getinformation from its IBM host onto a WIIS screen, it was more expensive touse its existing IBM host as an image server than to hook up a distributedapproachandM;&quot;Another major constraint is workstations,&quot; adds Michael Blum, director ofCoopers andamp; Lybrand's business systems group in New York, which implementsmidrange imaging systems.andP;  &quot;To do image on PCs, you have to upgrade withbetter resolution, and more storage and memory.andP;  People will not invest forbranch offices, especially if they have 2,000 or more PCs.andP;  To get aroundthis, you can centralize image, call up the system, ask for the image youwant to see, and it faxes the image out.andP;  IT's an interim solution for peoplewho don't want to replace PCs or transmit image on the network.&quot;andM;No LANs Yet Designed for ImageandM;In the communications arena, it is the size of blocks of image data comparedto blocks of text data that creates the challenge (see &quot;The 100KB FileFactor&quot;).andM;&quot;The biggest limitation on these systems is that there is no [local area]network that has been designed for imaging,&quot; says Anderson of Data Telecom.andO;Still, &quot;the fact that a vendor will say that it uses standard Ethernet orstandard Token Ring does not in any way mean that you can put [image] ontoyour existing network without having an awful lot of upset users,&quot; Andersoncomments, adding that the best solution right now is to do a good analysis ofthe network and run parallel networks where necessary to avoid killingresponse time for conventional inquiries.andM;Image users such as San Antonio-based USAA Information Services and U.S.andO;Trust are in fact running multiple Ethernets and Token Rings for imageapplications.andM;&quot;A number of people have called and [asked], 'How can you possibly be using aToken Ring network?'andP;  But we are using a number of them.andP;  If we had just oneToken Ring, we would run into trouble, but we wouldn't run just one,&quot; saysCharles Plesums, USAA's manager of image systems.andM;Throughput Restricted by Existing LANsandM;As advances are made in the areas where image systems today are typicallystressed--server architecture, optical storage unit software, and networkcontrollers--system throughput will be much more restricted by existing localarea networks, CAP's McCready adds.andP;  For the long haul, =vendors and usersare just starting to think about moving images over networks in any quantity,and they're running up against bandwidth problems, &quot;says Yankee Group's Mack.andO;But user options in overcoming those limitations are varied (see &quot;A Wide AreaWonderama&quot;).andM;&quot;The factors influencing the chosen [wide area] communications approachshould be the applications, whether they are batch or interactive, the volumeof documents, and the system topology; whether it's point to point,multipoint to poi nt to multipoint [long haul, short haul], symmetrical orasymmetrical, &quot;says Stephen Munro, manager of business development,International Datacasting Corp., Ottawa, Ont., a developer of hybridsatellite networks for File Net and Wang systems.andM;Munro says users are choosing hybrid satellite networks for image becausethey need high speed, either T1 or 512Kbps.andP;  &quot;56Kbps lines typically are notcutting it in volume applications.&quot;andM;TI circuits are cost-effective for point-to-point image transmission, assertsMunro.andP;  From New York to Atlanta, for example, would cost $10,300 a month.andO;But he adds that if you're looking at interactive, high-volume,multipoint-to-point or point-to-multipoint, long-haul applications, TIbecomes quite costly.andM;Transmitting image from, say, New York to Boston, Detroit, Cincinnati,Atlanta, Washington, and Philadelphia would cost about $42,000 a month.andP;  &quot;Andthat's just the monthly cost, it doesn't include the equipment needed, whichwith a File Net system would be about  $50,000 a site .andP;  .  .  .  It's ano-brainer,&quot; he concludes.andP;  &quot;You don't have to be a rocket scientist to knowthat a fax gateway is not going to cut it.andP;  The math tells you you've got tohave bandwidth and a big pipeline.&quot;andM;Operationally, the key considerations for users installing image systemsinclude the time and cost required for back-file conversion; carefullybuilding a comprehensive image index; ramping up carefully; and mostimportant, cooperatively selecting the pilot application to ensure asuccessful implementation of the technology.andM;&quot;whether users do back-file conversion of paper or microfilm to digitaldocuments depends on the frequency with which they are accessed, &quot;says TomFrederick, vp of marketing for Plexus Computers Inc., San Jose.andP;  &quot;The timeand cost required for back-file conversion depends on the condition of thedocuments, how much indexing is needed for them, and whether it is doneoffshore.andP;  It's factor that the vendors tend to underplay because it candramatically drive up the cost of implementation.&quot;andP;  (Plexus was forced tofile for Chapter 11 last month after its venture capitalists refused tocontinue funding.)andM;Plexus user Chet Punicki, director of is for the State of Colorado, says hiscrew is scanning between 700 and 800 corporate registration documents peroperator per 8-hour shift and, in a second shift, 600 to 700 UCC documentsper operator per 8- hour shift.andP;  The corporate papers can be scanned faster,having been &quot;blown back&quot; from microfilm onto uniform 8-1/2-by-11 paper, whileUCCs are all different sizes and must be scanned through with a flatbedinstead of automatic feeder.andM;Punicki planned to have completed all 1.5 million corporate legal documentsby April 1, one year after beginning the project.andP;  The state started scanningits 1.5 million UCC documents in January and expects to finish the job in ayear's time.andM;The use o optical character recognition  for converting paper documents islimited because of its inability to read various fronts or point sizes.andP;  Inaddition, a well-built and maintained index is critical to quick documentretrieval.andP;  &quot;If there's a typo in the indexing, they're not going to find it.andO;That's the Achilles heel to these systems--the index, how you construct it,and the quality of it,&quot; says CMA's Cofta.andP;  &quot;In our particular situation,which I don't think is common, if you made a typo in the product name, it'spossible that you would retrieve an older version of an MSDS, which couldpresent a problem.&quot;andM;Creating an appropriate, efficient indexing system posed a special problemfor Beth Oddy, information transfer specialist at Syracuse University'sKellogg Project.andP;  The project calls for archiving historical manuscript-typedocuments in the adult education field onto optical disk.andP;  Using a Plexus XDPsystem, Oddy had to come up with an index that allowed the most flexiblesearch possible.andP;  Most on-line library services, she says, use onlycollection-level indexing for manuscript collections, in accordance withstandard bibliographic practice.andP;  For this project, however, to enable peopleto get to a single page of a document, Oddy had to come up with a moredetailed template.andM;Using a full-text retrieval engine embedded in the XDP system, she hascreated a template with six different data types.andP;  &quot;We have 62 collections, acollection being a single person's papers.andP;  We will have a record for eachcollection, a record for each item, and four more data types--standardcitation information, organizational vitaes, individual vitaes, and a subjectsummary.andP;  Everything that is in one version of the template, which can be anyone of those six data types, is indexed in an inverted file,&quot; Oddy says.andM;Getting the most from document imaging requires end users to make an earlyinvestment in time and energy and compromise to understand how it may fitinto the business.andM;&quot;It's hard to get them to choose the best application for learning about thetechnology,&quot; CAP's McCready says.andP;  &quot;Everybody wants it for their area.andP;  A lotof people don't want to invest the time to go through the process properly;they just say they want to put in a system.andP;  We say, wait a minute, you wantus to tell you to choose IBM, DEC, or Wang, and you can't even tell us whatyou want ot use it for?&quot;andM;Mary Moore, U.S.andP;  Trust's vp of planning, agrees.andP;  She says without thecooperation &quot;of computer services, the vendors, and the asset managementdivision, which specified the application front end, and which was developedby AGA, I don't think the project would have been as successful as we expectit to continue to be.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
