Rosenberg began his firstattempt to vaccinate a terminal cancer patient to rally animmune response against the tumor.   The patient is a 46-year-old man with advanced malignantmelanoma, a fatal skin cancer that has resisted allconventional treatment.</LP><TEXT>   In this test Dr. Rosenberg, surgery chief at the NationalCancer Institute, Bethesda, Md., extends his work in cancergenetherapy, in which he previously stitched new genes intotumor-fighting white cells.   The difference is that this time Dr. Rosenberg has turnedthe concept on its head, genetically engineering the cancercell itself to sow the seeds of its own self-destruction, aswell as to boost the patient's immune system defenses. &quot;Thisis the first time we've manipulated the cancer cell itself toget the body to turn on it,&quot; Dr. Rosenberg said.   The test was approved earlier this week by the RecombinantDNA Advisory Committee of the National Institutes of Healthand by NIH Director Bernadine Healy. The U.S. Food and DrugAdministration also cleared the test, which was conducted atNIH in Bethesda.   &quot;The study's novel vaccine strategy will pioneer a newapproach to gene therapy in cancer,&quot; Dr. Healy said. However,Dr. Rosenberg stressed the new strategy &quot;is still highlyexperimental and not available or ready for general use.&quot;   The concept of cancer vaccines -- not to prevent, but totreat an existing tumor by boosting the immune system --isn't new to medicine. Many groups have tried injectingnumerous substances to rally immunity against cancer over thepast century, but none has worked, Dr. Rosenberg said.   Preparations for the experiment began five months ago,when Dr. Rosenberg's team surgically removed a piece of thispatient's tumor and implanted the gene for tumor-necrosisfactor, or TNF, a natural protein that erodes cancer. Thegenetically modified cancer cells were then grown in the lab,and reinjected into the patient's thigh yesterday. There, thecancer cells should start producing the TNF, and beginself-destructing.   &quot;TNF also marshals white blood lymphocytes, sending asignal which causes them to congregate at the tumor site,&quot;Dr. Rosenberg said. In the second phase of the experimentstarting in three weeks, these tumor-fighting cells will beplucked from the patient's lymph nodes, grown in the lab, andthen reinfused into the patient.</TEXT></DOC>
