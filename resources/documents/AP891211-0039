More than 100 people were arrested and three police officerssustained minor injuries, authorities said.   Inside, where 43 were arrested, demonstrators chained themselvesto pews and lay in the center aisle.   Outside, about 4,500 people marched along Fifth Avenue, withsome holding signs such as ``Curb Your Dogma'' and ``Pope John Paulfor Ayatollah.'' Others chanted ``Teach safe sex,'' and ``Just sayno is not enough.''   O'Connor asked the congregation Sunday to stand and join him inreciting prayers. He was forced to skip his sermon, handing outcopies instead.   Then, as dozens of police hauled protesters away on brightorange stretchers, O'Connor resumed the Mass.   Gay activists have staged several demonstrations at St.Patrick's since 1987, when O'Connor barred a homosexual RomanCatholic group, Dignity, from using church buildings.   Those arrested were charged with disorderly conduct andtrespassing, said Sgt. Peter Sweeney, a police spokesman.   The protest was organized by the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power(ACT UP) and Women's Health Action and Mobilization (WHAM!).   ``We demand to bring our issues to the cardinal directly andthat's what we did,'' said organizer Victor Mendolia.   A statement by the groups said they ``do not challenge anyone'sright to worship as they choose.'' However, they criticizedO'Connor for his opposition to abortion and his vocal support ofOperation Rescue, which has blockaded abortion clinics; forlobbying against education about safer sex and condoms, especiallyin schools; and for his opposition to gay rights legislation.   ``They are not moral issues. They are political issues,''Mendolia said. ``Their religious bullying infringes on the personalliberties of all Americans.''   Church officials, anticipating the well-publicizeddemonstration, cleared the church after the 9 a.m. Mass, thensearched the bags of everyone coming in for the 10:15 a.m. Mass.   The cathedral doors were locked a few minutes after Massstarted, said Joe Zwilling, an archdiocese spokesman. Police werestationed throughout the massive cathedral, even at the altar rail.   After the Mass, O'Connor said the protest left him anguished.   ``The archbishop of New York must of course always preach whatthe church preaches, teach what the church teaches,'' O'Connorsaid. ``I cannot believe that anyone, even those who hate what thechurch teaches, would respect me for a moment if I taught anythingelse.''   The congregation applauded enthusiastically.   O'Connor later said he was particularly upset that one personwho stood in line for Holy Communion broke the wafer and threw iton the floor.   Among those inside was Mayor Edward I. Koch, who is Jewish andhas differed with O'Connor on the issues that sparked the protestbut showed up ``to defend the cathedral.''   ``You don't have a right to disrupt a church service,'' Kochsaid. ``That's the law.''</TEXT></DOC>
