Free enterprise got free rein in the early years, driving theeconomy ahead and making billionaires out of characters as diverseas software entrepreneur Bill Gates and junk-bond wizard MichaelMilken.   But that unbridled pursuit of wealth turned Americans queasywell before the end of the decade. Ambition fostered as much greedas achievement, and great successes often were matched one-for-oneby crises.   The economy's durable growth was threatened by an overhang ofdebt. The bull market produced scandals and a Black Monday crash.Go-go lending led to a savings and loan debacle.   For the business world, it was a decade of revolution followedby reaction in three main arenas: political, technological andfinancial.   Politically, the decade began on Jan. 20, 1981, the day thehostages came home from Iran and Ronald Reagan took officepromising ``to reawaken this industrial giant, to get governmentback within its means, and to lighten our punitive tax burden.''   Within months, Reagan broke an illegal strike by the air trafficcontrollers union and proposed a giant tax cut.   That same year, International Business Machines Corp. rolled outits first personal computer in a strike against young Steve Jobsand Steve Wozniak at Apple Computer Inc. With IBM's blessing, thePC changed from a futuristic gadget into a deadly serious businesstool.   In finance, jut-browed Michael Milken, just 35 in 1981, wasusing high-yielding ``junk'' bonds to raise money for companiesshunned by traditional bond buyers _ companies like fast-growingMCI Communications Corp.   William McGowan, MCI's baggy-eyed gladiator, used junk bonds andthe federal courts in an assault on the world's largest company,American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. In 1982, ATandamp;T succumbed togovernment antitrust lawyers and agreed to the 1984 breakup of theBell System.   The walls were tumbling down. Across the Atlantic, MargaretThatcher was dismantling British socialism with a vengeance.Markets became freer as well in Western Europe, which envisioned atrue common marketplace by 1992, and Japan, which grew into aglobal economic powerhouse.   In the United States, the buoyant new spirit was best understoodin contrast with the 1970s, a brutal decade marred by the VietnamWar, Watergate, two oil-price shocks, stagflation and ineffectivegovernment tinkering with the economy.   Richard Nixon had tried wage and price controls. Gerald Ford hadpassed out WIN buttons, promising to Whip Inflation Now. As late as1980, Jimmy Carter was trying to discipline the economy with thefirst peacetime credit controls in U.S. history, including curbs onthe use of credit cards. Banks' prime lending rate briefly topped21 percent in 1980 and the price of gold, an inflation refuge,surpassed $800 an ounce.   Reagan came into office with a radically different agenda,convinced that cutting tax rates would unleash so much economicactivity that tax revenue would actually increase. Arthur Lafferhad sketched out the supply-side theory on a napkin in 1974.   It didn't happen exactly as Reagan wished. The tax cuts producedfat budget deficits. Fortunately for him, though, budget deficitsare painless, at least in the short run. The pain was inflicted byPaul Volcker, the stern, 6-foot-7 chairman of the Federal Reserve,who pushed up interest rates to squeeze out inflation.   Volcker's medicine produced the deepest recession since WorldWar II, with unemployment rates topping 10 percent in the summer of1982. But it did wring inflationary expectations out of the system,and by that November, the economy began an expansion that continuesto this day, the longest in U.S. peacetime history.   In contrast to the inward-looking Me Decade, Americans lookedoutward in the '80s because the business world demanded it. The oldorder was fractured and they were forced to make new choices.Fixed-rate mortgage or adjustable? IRA or 401(k)? ATandamp;T or MCI orSprint?   Carter had launched deregulation, in airlines, trucking andbanking, but it was Reagan who became the movement's spiritualgodfather.   The Money Decade made economic creatures of us all. Businessnews leaped to the front page. Financial News Network was born. LeeIacocca became a best-selling author. ``Dallas'' and ``Lifestylesof the Rich and Famous'' were voyeuristic hits.   Americans exulted in capitalism in the early '80s, none morethan Phoenix financier Charles Keating, who built an empire bybuying savings and loans and speculating with the money depositedin them.   By 1989, Charles Keating faced accusations that he had looted orabused depositors' funds while bribing U.S. senators with politicaldonations.   Keating's downfall capped a series of events beginning in themid-1980s that turned many Americans against the excesses of thedecade. All three revolutions _ political, financial andtechnological _ were in some way tarnished.   In 1985, the United States, world champion of free enterprise,became a net debtor for the first time since the eve of World War I.   In November 1986, Ivan Boesky surrendered $100 million andagreed to plead guilty to a felony as a budding government probe ofinsider trading sideswiped Wall Street's roaring bull market.   On Oct. 19, 1987, the Dow Jones industrial average plunged arecord 508 points, intensifying concerns about the health andfairness of the markets.   In 1988, Americans learned that the previous year's tradedeficit had hit a record $152 billion _ a hemorrhage of $4,800 asecond.   The crowning blow came in 1989, when taxpayers found out thatthe deregulated and fraud-riddled savings and loan industry wouldrequire a $159 billion bailout.   It began to seem the Reagan Revolution had not kept the UnitedStates from digging itself into a deep hole of debt; thatuntrammeled markets could get dangerously out of balance; and thatderegulation had opened the cookie jar to shameless thieves.   Even the long-lived economic expansion was less impressive whenit became apparent how little it had done to raise livingstandards. After adjustment for inflation, hourly earnings ofnon-supervisory workers actually were lower throughout the 1980sthan in 1969.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
