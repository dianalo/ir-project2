Bishop Raymundo Peno dedicated the church as a shrine to theVirgin of Guadalupe, the first such shrine in the El Paso RomanCatholic Diocese.   ``In the future, we hope this will become the center forspiritual growth in West Texas,'' Pena said of the only church inthe predominantly Hispanic town of about 350 people. ``They cancome for spiritual retreats and for pilgrimages.''   The brown-and-gray brick structure was built on the site of theold cinder block church, which was leveled during the May 22, 1987,tornado. The new building, completed in late June, boastsclassrooms, a dormitory and kitchen.   The church's sanctuary is dominated by a blue-and-orange stainedglass archway with a statuette of the Virgin of Guadalupe in thecenter.   The church held a much larger crowd Sunday than the sanctuary'sofficial capacity of 276, as lay representatives from every parishin the vast El Paso Diocese attended. The crowd of about 600spilled into the halls and outside as worshipers strained to hear.   ``It's great to have the church back,'' said Tomas Martinez, wholives a block west of the building. ``If we had a crowd like thisevery time, we'd have a pretty good town here.''   Last year's tornado destroyed about 40 houses. Many of the 30people who were killed were attending a preschool graduationceremony at a community center when the twister hit the structurewith little warning.   Gabriel Candelas, who grew up across the street from the church,said he rushed to Saragosa from his home in El Paso when he heardabout the twister. He arrived about 3 a.m., eight hours after thetornado, he said.   ``It was unrecognizable _ completely different,'' he said. ``Icouldn't find my parents' house.''   A little over a year later, the Red Cross, Texas Department ofCommunity Affairs, and the Catholic Church have rebuilt everyhouse. A new community center with a 300-person capacity tornadoshelter is a block from the church.   ``It's definitely had an impact on the people _ tension,stress,'' Candelas said. ``Some people are very moody because theylost all they had and their loved ones. But it's getting better.''</TEXT></DOC>
