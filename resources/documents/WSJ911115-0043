But the agreement's victory margin was narrower than the80% approval other GM workers represented by the United AutoWorkers Union gave their last national contract in October1990, suggesting that GM's attempt to foster more cooperativelabor relations at Saturn is running into turbulence. Anothersign of trouble is that Saturn will offer disgruntled workersup to $50,000 to leave.</LP><TEXT>   Under the agreement, base pay for Saturn workers will rise16% as part of a plan to increase pension benefits. But aSaturn spokesman said that when certain other payments thataren't part of base pay are considered, total pay for UAWworkers will rise only 2.1% to 2.7% from a year ago.   Saturn has involved hourly workers in many decisionstraditionally reserved for management. In return, Saturninitially convinced its 4,560 UAW-represented workers toaccept lower base pay and pensions than their GMcounterparts, and to put 20% of their wages at risk dependingon Saturn's performance. But under the new, open-ended pact,only 5% of a worker's pay will depend on Saturn's 1992performance, and that could be recovered if the worker agreesto more training.</TEXT></DOC>
