The Norfolk, Va., transportation company said it reachedthe agreements in six of its eight union districts. Theagreements are subject to ratification by the union'smembership during votes planned to take place this month.</LP><TEXT>   The agreements, if ratified, would be the second majorcrew reductions to be negotiated since a congressionallyappointed special board made its final rail laborrecommendations last summer.   Last month Burlington Northern Inc., a Fort Worth, Texas,transportation company, said union members ratified anagreement to cut train crew sizes on the southern two-thirdsof its railroad.   Transportation analysts said such agreements constituted amajor breakthrough for the railroad industry in its battle toshed costs and compete with motor carriers. Some analysts saythe crew reductions, once spread through the industry, couldcut the railroads' annual labor bill by more than $1 billion.   &quot;It's potentially the most favorable development for therailroad industry since {diesel conversion} in the 1950s andelimination of the firemen in the 1960s,&quot; said Isabel Benhamof Printon, Kane Research Inc., a railroad consulting firm.   But it's unlikely that railroads will be able to retainall of the potential savings. &quot;The railroads will want toenhance their balance sheets,&quot; said Charles Wilkins, directorof transportation and traffic of Ford Motor Co. &quot;But shippersare going to want a piece of the productivity improvements&quot;in the form of lower rates.   Norfolk Southern officials have said that the crewreduction agreements would eventually allow its trains tooperate with two or three employees, a reduction of one ortwo per train, and eliminate about 3,000 of the 7,000 UnitedTransportation Union employees on the railroad's 15,000 milesof routes.   L.P. King Jr., a union general chairman, said that underthe agreements the company is offering one-time separationpayments of $50,000 to surplus train crew members. He saidthat surplus crew members who want to stay with the company,in hopes of being called to work, have the option of going ona reserve board entitling them to 75% of their salary and allof their health and welfare benefits. Norfolk Southernofficials declined to discuss terms.</TEXT></DOC>
