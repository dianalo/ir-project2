Paul Freedenberg, deputy secretary of commerce for export administration, said Boeing has been given the required licenses to sell or lease three of those extended-range models to the Polish airline LOT and two others to Romania's Tarom. The combined sales could reached anywhere from $280 million to $370 million, depending on how each plane is configured.    Boeing is competing for both orders with Airbus Industrie. In the past the European consortium has beaten its U.S. rival with superior financing from its four sponsoring governments. But Mr. Freedenberg said Boeing may be able to counter Airbus' financial terms by offering LOT and Tarom lease arrangements rather than outright purchases. &quot;The two airlines don't even have to put down any money,&quot; he said. &quot;They can pay it off through their sales revenues.&quot;    Poland and Romania are short of hard currency. The U.S. Export-Import Bank could assist the Polish transaction, but it's legally forbidden to lend funds to Romania. The U.S. recently stripped Romania of certain trade privileges, including access to Ex-Im Bank financing, as a result of Bucharest's human-rights record.    Western allies recently changed their export-control rules to allow airliner sales to East Bloc countries. Airbus quickly made the first deal; last month it announced the sale of three A310-300 jets to the East German airline Interflug.    But Polish or Romanian orders for Boeing planes could put the Seattle-based company solidly in contention for the new East Bloc market. Boeing estimates the market will be small at first but that it could expand to as many as 100 aircraft in 12 years. If a deal is struck, the 767s will replace aging Soviet-made Ilyushins on LOT's Warsaw-New York and Warsaw-Chicago routes.    McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s Douglas aircraft division claims that it's also in the race. The Long Beach, Calif.-based unit said it's offering its twin-jet MD-80 family and its new MD-11 trijet to several potential East Bloc buyers. The MD-11 has been designed to compete directly with Airbus' long-haul A340 airliner.    The Douglas Aircraft unit said it has obtained licenses from U.S. authorities to make sales presentations to potential East Bloc buyers. Such licenses authorize a U.S. firm to convey certain technical information to a proscribed country but are less indicative of a potential sale than Boeing's licenses to export actual aircraft.    The Commerce Department is imposing safeguards to prevent certain technology secrets from being compromised. These include sealing off the sophisticated cockpit electronics, including the inertial navigation systems. Engines sections that reflect advanced designs will also be protected from unathorized inspection. &quot;The essential maintenance of those planes has to be done in the West,&quot; the department's Mr. Freedenberg said.    The Airbus sale likewise provides for Interflug's A310s to be maintained by the West German airline Lufthansa at secure locations.    A Boeing spokesman said, &quot;We have indications from LOT in Poland that they would prefer the 767. This means we can begin serious negotiations with them, including delivery dates.&quot; The sale to Romania's Tarom airline &quot;is a long way from consummated,&quot; the spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
