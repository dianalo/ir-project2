Zech Jr. said in an interview.   Zech said the proposed change could be approved by the commissionas early as next month.   The licensing reform idea is strongly supported by the utilityindustry, which blames regulatory barriers for its current financialproblems. Environmental groups oppose the change, saying it wouldlimit their ability to challenge applications for constructionpermits and operating licenses.   ``This would be a giant step forward,'' Zech said in an interviewin his NRC office.   He declined to speculate on whether the four other commissionerswould vote for the rule change, which he said does not requirecongressional approval. The commisioners were briefed on theinch-thick document by their staff on Wednesday.   Zech said he had not yet studied the document in enough detail tobe sure he would support the plan, but he repeatedly expressedenthusiasm for such changes.   The plan would make three major changes in the licensing process:   _Allow utilities to get federal approval for a plant site longbefore committing themselves to actually building on it.   _Encourage manufacturers to develop standardized reactor designs.This would allow utilities to choose a design already certified bythe NRC and not requiring the current lengthy process of gainingdesign approval during the licensing process.   _Permitting utilities to get their plant construction permit atthe same time as their operating license. Currently this is atwo-step process, and in some cases completed plants have stood idlebecause of failure to get an operating permit.   ``The most important thing about this whole endeavor is to do asmuch up front in the whole licensing process as possible so youdon't have big major decisions for after the plant's been built,''Zech said.   He said utilities would be able to get plants built and licensedwithin six years, and possibly sooner, compared with the recentaverage of 13 years.   The utility industry contends that long delays in obtaining NRClicenses is one reason that no new nuclear plants have been orderedsince the mid-1970s. Zech said that with the rule change, someorders might be placed in the early 1990s.   James D. Watkins, the Bush administration's designated energysecretary, told his confirmation hearing Wednesday that streamliningthe nuclear plant licensing process ``could get things moving, couldrelieve the kind of constipation we have in the process now.''   Environmental groups, however, have been critical of theregulatory reform proposals.   Michael Mariotte, director of the Nuclear Information andResource Service, which is strongly critical of the industry and theNRC, said the rule changes would unfairly limit the public's rightto fight a plant licensing. He said the main purpose of the changeswas to aid the nuclear industry.   ``For them there is no future without'' the streamlined process,Mariotte said in a recent interview, adding that his group mightchallenge the plan in court.</TEXT></DOC>
