The treaty calls for a 20 percent reduction from 1986 emissionsof the most active chlorofluorocarbon compounds, called CFCs, totake effect in 1993. There would be an additional 30 percent cut inmid-1998.   Participating countries also pledged to impose traderestrictions on products containing CFC compounds from countriesnot signing the treaty.   Major producing nations and the European Common Market agreed tothe cuts last September in Montreal under prodding from the UnitedStates, Canada and the Scandinavian nations _ countries that banneduse of CFC compounds in aerosol sprays in 1978. The United Stateshad sought a 95 percent reduction.   European countries before that had argued that a ban on newproduction capacity would be sufficient to protect ozone. TheSoviet Union, a major producer, won special provisions permittingthat country to use the output of plants under construction andexceed the emissions limits temporarily. The Soviets signed thetreaty in December.   The Soviet exemptions, and similar provisions for developingnations, have led the Environmental Defense Fund to conclude thatthe actual emissions reduction in 1998 could be only 35 percentinstead of 50 percent.   Backers of the treaty hope it will serve as a model forinternational agreement to control the ``greenhouse effect,'' theexpected warming of the Earth caused by the growing concentrationof several gases in the atmosphere, notably carbon dioxide fromfossil fuel combustion.   CFC compounds, first formed in 1929, are widely used inrefrigeration, production of plastic foams and as solvents to cleancomputer equipment.   The compounds may last 100 years in the atmosphere, eventuallyrising to the ozone layer, 15 miles to 25 miles above the Earth'ssurface.   The Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that a 1percent shrinkage of the Earth's ozone layer will increase skincancer by 5 percent or 6 percent.   Whether the ozone layer is shrinking is hard to determinebecause ozone normally fluctuates every year, with sunspots andvolcanic eruptions influencing how much is formed. The NationalAeronautics and Space Administration is scheduled to report Tuesdayon whether the ozone layer is getting thinner.   NASA researchers have said there might have been a decline ofabout 0.5 percent per year recently _ but that estimate wasuncertain, and was being debated in a review group of 100scientists from around the world.   The treaty will not come into force until at least 11 countries,representing two-thirds of the world's production capacity for CFCcompounds, have ratified it. The United States will become thesecond country, behind Mexico, to ratify.</TEXT></DOC>
