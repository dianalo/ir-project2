Kennedy proposed legislation Wednesday that would givethe government control over tobacco products and finance ananti-smoking campaign.   Kennedy, who was joined in a Capitol Hill news conference byformer surgeon general C. Everett Koop, said he decided againstincluding tough limits on cigarette exports and advertising toincrease the chances that the bill would pass.   ``The tobacco lobby is still one of the strongest lobbies in theCongress, there's no question about it,'' said Kennedy, D-Mass.``This is not an attempt to ban cigarettes,'' he said. ``I think wecan get a greater degree of support with this approach.''   The legislation, which is still being drafted for introductionlater, would call for a total of $185 million in federal spendingnext year on an anti-smoking advertising campaign, grants tostates, schools and businesses that promote anti-smoking programsand money to establish a new Center for Tobacco Products.   The center would for the first time give the federal governmentregulatory control over the contents of cigarettes. Packs ofcigarettes would be required to carry information either on thepackage or inside about the various tobacco additives, ``many ofwhich are carcinogenic,'' Kennedy said.   The Tobacco Institute, the tobacco industry's main Washingtonlobbyist, said Kennedy was proposing to waste public money to alertpeople about something they already know. ``Statistics across theboard show that 99 percent of the American people are aware of whatthe surgeon general has to say about smoking,'' said institutespokeswoman Brennan Dawson.   Requiring cigarette companies to list ingredients on packagingwould violate trade secrets, Dawson said. And a provision of theKennedy bill that would lift a federal prohibition onstate-by-state regulation of advertising would create a``crazy-quilt'' of local advertising restrictions.   Koop, who was appointed surgeon general by then-PresidentReagan, noted how unusual it is for him to agree with Kennedy.   ``It's about time that the federal government stood up to becounted on a product that kills 390,000 people every year,'' Koopsaid. ``Cigarettes are the only legal product in America which,when used as advertised, kills you.''   Kennedy said he would try to quit smoking cigars, a habit he hasmaintained over the years. ``I wish I had never started and I'll domy best to give it up.''</TEXT></DOC>
