The reduction isresulted from the suppression of metal impurity release such as titaniumand iron especially around the ICRF antenna. This result intensivelysupports the theoretical prediction that the electric field near theantenna plays the dominant role to induce the metal impurity releaseduring ICRF heating.</TEXT></DOC>
