Last year Houston-based Enron said it would consider selling the oil and gas unit -- the nation's third largest independent energy company -- which is valued at about $2 billion. But the receipt of unsatisfactory bids and a glut of properties on the market at that time led the company to change its mind. Enron is a natural gas transmission concern.    Underwriters for the offering, First Boston Corp., Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., and Prudential-Bache Capital Funding, have been granted an over-allotment option for about 1.2 million shares. Enron will retain an 87% or 88% stake in the unit. Net proceeds of between $115 million and $130 million will be used to repay advances from the parent company. </TEXT></DOC>
