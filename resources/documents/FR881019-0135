Background </ITAG>Pursuant to Public Law (P.L.) 97-415, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission(the Commission) is publishing this regular biweekly notice. P.L. 97-415revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act),to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, orproposed to be issued, under a new provision of section 189 of the Act.This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediatelyeffective any amendment to an operating license upon a determination bythe Commission that such amendment involves no significant hazards consideration,notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearingfrom any person. This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposedto be issued from September 26, 1988 through October 6, 1988. The lastbiweekly notice was published on October 5, 1988 (53 FR 39165). <ITAG tagnum="84">NOTICE OF CONSIDERATION OF ISSUANCE OF AMENDMENT TO FACILITY OPERATINGLICENSE AND PROPOSED NO SIGNIFICANT HAZARDS CONSIDERATION DETERMINATIONAND OPPORTUNITY FOR HEARING </ITAG>The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendmentrequests involve no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission'sregulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facilityin accordance with the proposed amendments would not (1) involve a significantincrease in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated;or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination for eachamendment request is shown below. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination.Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of thisnotice will be considered in making any final determination. The Commissionwill not normally make a final determination unless it receives a requestfor a hearing. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Regulatory PublicationsBranch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Officeof Administration and Resources Management, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page numberof this <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. Written comments may also be deliveredto Room P-216, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda, Marylandfrom 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Copies of written comments received may beexamined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,NW., Washington, DC. The filing of requests for hearing and petitions forleave to intervene is discussed below. By November 18, 1988 the licensee may file a request for a hearing withrespect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operatinglicense and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceedingand who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file awritten petition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and petitionsfor leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part2. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filedby the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board,designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety andLicensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition and theSecretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issuea notice of hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding,and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contentionset forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited tomatters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determinationon the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determinationwill serve to decide when the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significanthazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and makeit immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Anyhearing held would take place after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the amendment involves a significanthazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuanceof any amendment. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expirationof the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change duringthe notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result,for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission mayissue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day noticeperiod, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involvesno significant hazards consideration. The final determination will considerall public and State comments received before action is taken. Should theCommission take this action, it will publish a notice of issuance and providefor opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects thatthe need to take this action will occur very infrequently. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may bedelivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, by the above date. Where petitionsare filed during the last ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requestedthat the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephonecall to Western Union at 1-(800) 325-6000 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number3737 and the following message addressed to (<T3>Project Director</T3>): petitioner's name and telephone number; datepetition was mailed; plant name; and publication date and page number ofthis <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. A copy of the petition should also besent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions,supplemental petitions and/or requests for hearing will not be entertainedabsent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or thepresiding Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, that the petition and/or requestshould be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified in 10 CFR2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment which is available for public inspection at the Commission'sPublic Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,DC, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved.<ITAG tagnum="84">Baltimore Gas and Electric Company, Docket Nos. 50-317 and 50-318,Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, Calvert County,Maryland </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment requests: </T3>June 16, 1988 and April 14, 1986,as supplemented on April 28, 1987. <T3>Description of amendment requests: </T3>The following proposed changesto the Technical Specifications (TS) are in partial response to the BaltimoreGas and Electric Company (BGandamp;E, the licensee) submittals dated June16, 1988 and April 14, 1986, as supplemented on April 28, 1987. The remainingissues will be addressed in separate correspondence. The proposed Units1 and 2 TS changes would (1) modify TS 3/4.8.2.3, ``Electrical Power Systems:D.C. Distribution - Operating,'' deleting the 18-month station batteryservice test dummy load profile from TS Surveillance Requirement (SR) 4.8.2.3.2.d.2and maintaining the load profile in the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power PlantUnits 1 and 2 Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) where it shallbe controlled through the processes described in 10 CFR 50.59, ``Changes,Tests and Experiments''; (2) adding the definition, ``Refueling Interval- At least once per 24 months,'' to TS Definition 1.22, ``Frequency Notation,''Table 1.2; and (3) modify TS 3/4.3.6, ``Instrumentation - Post-AccidentInstrumentation,'' Table 3.3-10, ``Post-Accident Monitoring InstrumentationSurveillance Requirements,'' by adding operability and surveillance testingrequirements for the core exit thermocouple system. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>Change No. 1, as proposed in the BGandamp;E letter of April 14, 1986,as supplemented on April 28, 1987, would delete the dummy load profilefrom the 18-month battery service test of TS SR 4.8.2.3.2.d.2. The correctbattery load profile would be maintained in the UFSAR and controlled throughthe processes described in 10 CFR 50.59. The licensee is requesting thischange to facilitate the shifting or modification of emergency loads onthe four separate station batteries as necessitated by plant modificationsand hardware additions. In the June 16, 1988 submittal, BGandamp;E proposed Change No. 2, which addsthe definition ``Refueling Interval-At least once per 24 months'' to TSDefinition 1.22, ``Frequency Notation,'' Table 1.2, and Change No. 3 whichmodifies TS Tables 3.3-10 and 4.3-10 by adding operability and surveillancetesting requirements for the core exit thermocouple system. The licensee requested Change No. 2 to add the refueling interval definitionto the TS in order to support the licensee's 24-month operating cycle.Recently, the Commission has approved several TS amendments in which theassociated surveillance interval was changed from ``R'', at least onceper 18 months, to the new frequency of ``Refueling Interval'' which wasdefined as at least once per 24 months. The ``Refueling Interval'' frequencynotation is not used anywhere else in the Units 1 and 2 TS other than theamendments recently made in support of the 24-month operating cycle. Change No. 3 requests the addition to the TS of operability and surveillancerequirements for the core exit thermocouple system which was installedin response to NUREG-0737, ``Clarification of TMI Action Plan Requirements,''Item II.F.2, ``Instrumentation for Detection of Inadequate Core Cooling.''The licensee evaluated these proposed changes against the standards of10 CFR 50.92 and has determined that the amendments would not: (i) Involve a significant increase in probability or consequences of anaccident previously evaluated... Change No. 1 is administrative in nature. No plant operations or equipmentare affected as the station batteries will continue to be required by TSSR 4.8.2.3.2.d to successfully complete an 18-month battery service testunder design basis emergency loading conditions. Furthermore, any futureload profile changes will be required to be fully defined with an adequatelyreviewed and approved safety evaluation performed in accordance with theprovisions of 10 CFR 50.59 prior to the implementation of any load changes.Change No. 2 is administrative in nature, too. The addition of the frequencynotation, ``Refueling Interval,'' will affect only those TS requirementsthat were modified to support implementation of the licensee's 24-monthoperating cycle. Of the TS requirements affected, all were previously analyzedand approved for a 24-month surveillance interval. The addition of thisdefinition is proposed for the sole purpose of placing these previouslyapproved TS requirements surveillance interval changes in effect. Change No. 3 proposes the addition of TS operability and surveillance requirementsfor the newly added core exit thermocouple system. These operability andsurveillance requirements represent additional restrictions over the TSrequirements currently in effect. Furthermore, the addition of these operabilityand surveillance requirements will not affect any other plant operations,equipment or accident analyses. Consequently, these proposed changes would not result in any increase inthe probability or consequences of previously evaluated accidents. (ii) Create the possibility of a new or different type of accident fromany accident previously evaluated... These proposed changes do not alter any plant operability requirements,surveillance testing, maintenance, or system design or functions otherthan (1) the Change No. 2 implementation of the previously approved 24-monthsurveillance interval for specifically evaluated TS requirements and (2)the Change No. 3 addition of new, restrictive surveillance and operabilityrequirements for the recently installed core exit thermocouple system.The 24-month surveillance interval, as provided by the ``Refueling Interval''frequency notation, was previously evaluated and approved for all TS requirementswhere this frequency notation is now in use. For each of these individualTS requirements, the NRC staff has previously determined that these changesin surveillance interval would not create the possibility of a new or differenttype of accident from any accident previously evaluated. With regards to the addition of TS surveillance and operability requirementsfor the core exit thermocouple system, which is presently installed, thesenew TS requirements do not affect any other plant operations or equipment.Thus, these changes, as proposed, would not create the possibility of anynew or different type of accident. (iii) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety... These proposals do not alter any plant operational requirements or restrictionsother than the Change No. 3 addition of new, restrictive core exit thermocouplesystem operability requirements. Therefore, these proposed changes willnot involve any reduction in any margin of safety. Finally, on March 6, 1986, the NRC published guidance in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(51 FR 7751) concerning examples of amendmentsthat are not likely to involve a significant hazards consideration. These changes are consistent with two of the examples provided: ``(i) Apurely administrative change to the Technical Specifications...'' and ``(ii)A change that constitutes an additional limitation, restriction, or controlnot presently included in the Technical Specifications.'' Consequently,the NRC staff proposes to determine that these proposed changes to TS 4.8.2.3.2.d.2;TS 1.22, Table 1.2; and TS 3/4.3.6, Tables 3.3-10 and 4.3-10 involve nosignificant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Calvert County Library, PrinceFrederick, Maryland. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Jay E.

The staff has evaluatedthe proposed amendment and determined that it involves no significant hazardsconsideration. In accordance with the criteria set forth in 10 CFR 50.92(c),the proposed amendment does not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously analyzed. The increased surveillance for fires inthe area below the control room structural steel, when the fire suppressionsystem is inoperable, has the potential to reduce the consequences andprobability of turbine building fires, and therefore does not increasethe probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed. The reduction in the number of smoke detectors will not affect any designbasis event. There are no cable trays or transient combustibles in thevicinity of this detector which is intended to be removed. The change willnot impact the ability to detect fires in the outer annulus, thereforethe change will not affect previously analyzed accidents. 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from anypreviously analyzed. The reduction in the number of smoke detectors andthe increased surveillance for fires in the area below the control roomstructural steel does not change the way the plant is operated. Since thereare no changes in the way the plant is operated, the potential for an unanalyzedaccident is not created. No new failure modes are introduced. The modificationsdo not affect safety systems or components and, therefore, do not affectany design basis accident. Since no safety systems are affected by theproposed changes, there can be no affect on the probability of failureof any safety system. Therefore, the proposed Technical Specification changesdo not create the probability of an accident or malfunction of a new ordifferent type than any evaluated previously in the safety analysis report.3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Since the proposedchanges do not have any impact on any design basis accident, there canbe no impact on any protective boundary. Since there is no impact on anyprotective boundary as a result of the proposed changes, there can be noimpact on any safety limit. The proposed changes have no impact on thebasis of any Technical Specification. The proposed changes maintain thebasis of the Technical Specifications in assuring adequate smoke detectionand fire suppression. Accordingly, the staff has proposed to determine that the application foramendment does not involve a significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Russell Library, 123 BroadStreet, Middletown, Connecticut 06457. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Gerald Garfield, Esquire, Day, Berry andamp;Howard, Counselors at Law, City Place, Hartford, Connecticut 06103-3499.<T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>John F.

Does the proposed license amendment involve a significant increase inthe probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated? The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated since there is no changeto any plant system or operating procedures. This amendment upgrades andformalizes requirements to restore the minimum number of required armedresponders due to an unexpected loss, for example due to illness, of amember of the security force. This program specifies the methods by whichoff-duty guards are ``called-in'' from their residences. 2. Does the proposed license amendment create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated? The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any accident previously evaluated since the plant'sdesign and operating procedures remain unaffected. This change only addressessecurity measures (procedures) which do not involve any plant safety systems.3. Does the proposed license amendment involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety? The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a marginof safety since no change is made to the plant's design or operating procedures.The ``call-in'' program is considered reasonable because the probabilityof a security contingency event occurring during the short period of timewhile a guard is responding from his residence is considered very low dueto the infrequent and unpredictable nature of these circumstances. Accordingly, the Commission proposes to determine that the proposed amendmentinvolves no significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>North Central Michigan College,1515 Howard Street, Petoskey, Michigan 49770. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Judd L.

This item requires specialinspections of Diesel Generator (DG) 2B main bearing number 7. Such inspectionswere the result of two failures of this bearing during preoperational testingin order to ensure that measures taken to prevent further recurrences wereeffective. The licensee stated that since January 17, 1986 to the presenttime, DG 2B main bearing number 7 has successfully sustained more than360 starts and accumulated over 350 hours of operation. Inspection of bearingnumber 7 during End-of-Cycle 1 refueling outage following 333 starts and316 hours of operation revealed no defects, abnormal appearance, or unusualreadings. Thus, discontinuing future special inspections of DG 2B mainbearing number 7 would not involve any adverse safety considerations. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment toan operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerationif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The staff has reviewed the licensee's request for the above amendment anddetermined that should this request be implemented, it would not (1) involvea significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accidentpreviously evaluated because implementation of the proposed amendment wouldnot change any of the assumptions used in the accident analysis. Operatingexperience has demonstrated the adequacy of DG 2B and of the measures takento ensure proper alignment of main bearings. Therefore, this amendmentwould not affect DG 2B's capability to perform its intended safety functionand would not increase the probability or consequences of an accident.Also, it would not (2) create the possibility of a new or different kindof accident from any accident previously evaluated because the proposedamendment would not introduce any new modes of operation and would notinvolve any modification to the facility. Finally, it would not (3) involvea significant reduction in a margin of safety because operating experienceand inspection results have demonstrated that main bearing number 7 isas reliable as any other DG bearing. Accordingly, the Commission has determined that the above change involvesno significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>York County Library, 138East Black Street, Rock Hill, South Carolina 29730 <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Mr. Albert Carr, Duke Power Company, 422South Church Street, Charlotte, North Carolina 28242 <T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>David B. Matthews <ITAG tagnum="84">Duke Power Company, et. al., Docket No. 50-414, Catawba Nuclear Station,Unit, 2, York County, South Carolina </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>September 14, 1988 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The proposed amendment wouldrevise License Condition 2.C.(8)(b) of Catawba Unit 2 Facility OperatingLicense, NPF-52, to allow an extension of time for the resolution of theSafety Parameter Display System (SPDS) issue. The extension of time wouldbe for a period of approximately 10 months (from the completion of Unitsecond refueling outage until December 8, 1988). The modified License Condition2.C.(8)(b) would then read ``Prior to December 8, 1989, Duke Power Companyshall add to the existing SPDS and have operational the following SPDSparameters: (a) residual heat removal flow, (b) containment isolation status,(c) stack radiation measurements, and (d) steam generator or steamlineradiation. The actual value of test and all other SPDS variable shouldbe displayed for operator viewing in easily and rapidly accessible displayformats.'' <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>Supplement 1 to NUREG-0737 required licensees to install and SPDSwhich provides a concise display of critical plant variables to controlroom operators to aid them in rapidly and reliably determining the safetystatus of the plant. In February 1986, the NRC staff issued the low-power Facility OperatingLicense, NPF-48, for Catawba Unit 2 along with Supplement 5 to the SafetyEvaluation Report. Supplement 6 concluded that the Catawba SPDS does notfully meet the applicable requirements of Supplement 1 to NUREG-0737. However,since the staff did not identify any serious safety concerns with the existingsystem, the Catawba SPDS may be operated as an interim implementation untilstartup following the first refueling outage. The SER identified five parameters and the backup display as modificationsneeding to be made to the Catawba SPDS. These requirements were imposedas License Condition 2.C.(9)(b) of the low-power Facility Operating License,NPF-48, and later as License Condition 2.C.(8)(b) in the full-power FacilityOperating License, NPF-52. On March 25, 1986, the licensee identified the requested changes as a plant-specificbackfit and requested that the NRC staff prepare a backfit analysis. Byletter dated June 13, 1986, the staff denied the licensee's backfit claim.On March 26, 1987, the licensee appealed the staff's denial of the backfitclaim. By letter dated September 4, 1987, the staff concluded that 4 ofthe 5 parameters identified in Supplement 5 along with the backup displaysshould be added. One of the five parameters previously required, hot legtemperature, was already included as an input into SPDS. By letter dated December 4, 1987, the licensee proposed that License Condition2.C.(8)(b) of Catawba Unit 2 Facility Operating License NPF-52 be amendedto (1) allow an extension of time for the resolution of the SPDS issue,and (2) make it consistent with NRC staff's conclusions contained in theSeptember 4, 1987 letter. On February 18, 1988, the NRC approved the requestedextension for one complete cycle of operation by the issuance of licenseamendment No. 32 for Catawba Unit 2. By letter dated February 18, 1988, the licensee submitted a proposed finalresolution of this issue. By letter dated May 13, 1988, the NRC staff acceptedthe licensee's proposal. The SPDS is not a safety-grade system and is not intended to fulfill thepost-accident monitoring requirements of Regulatory Guide 1.97. All parameters,including the addition the additional parameters, are already providedin the control room. It is, therefore, the licensee's conclusion that extensionof the date of modification of the Catawba Unit 2 SPDS until December 8,1989, does not involve any adverse safety considerations. The staff agreeswith the licensee's evaluation for extending the implementation date byapproximately 10 months. The Commission has provided standards of determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment toan operating license involves no significant hazards consideration if operationof the the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not:(1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or(3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase in theprobability of an accident previously evaluated because the SPD is providedas an aid to the operator, all parameters displayed on the SPDS are providedseparately in the control room, and the SPDS is not used for control functions.The proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident than previously evaluated because the design and operationof Catawba Unit 2 will not be affected. The proposed amendment would not cause a significant reduction in a marginof safety. The extension of time in which to resolve the SPDS issue andperform required modifications would have no impact on safety margins becausethe SPDS is intended to aid the operators and is not relied upon as a safetysystem. Based on the above consideration, the Commission proposes to determinethat the proposed amendment involves no significant hazards consideration.<T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>York County Library, 138East Black Street, Rock Hill, South Carolina 29730 <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Mr. Albert Carr, Duke Power Company, 422South Church Street, Charlotte, North Carolina 28242 <T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>David B.

The proposed changes also reflect the staff'stechnical position expressed in Generic Letter 83-37. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment toan operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerationif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; (2) create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or(3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed changes impose new and additional requirements on the instrumentsinstalled to detect inadequate core cooling. The staff has reviewed thedesigns of these instruments as stated above, and has found them acceptable.These changes would not affect any accident analysis in the FSAR sincethe instruments do not initiate any automatic functions during an accident,but only serve to provide useful information on relevant parameters tothe plant operators. The information can be used by operators to help reduceconsequences of accidents. Therefore, the answers to the first two questionsare negative. The use of these instruments will not result in the needto modify any system set points. There is, therefore, no change in themargins of safety of any system. On such basis, the staff proposes to determine that the requested amendmentinvolves no significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>B. F.

The changes are grouped into three categoriesand cover both units. Category 1 changes deal with achieving consistency between the Unit 1 TSand the Unit 2 TS. First, the Bases for the reactor flow-low trip functionwill be clarified in both unit TS Bases statements. The format of Table3.7-3 in the Unit 1 TS, Fire Hose Stations, will be changed to reflectthe format contained for the similar table in the Unit 2 TS. One per centdelta K/K will be changed in TS 3.9.1 for Unit 1 to 1,000 pcm, an equivalentvalue. PCM values are used throughout both Units' TS. The word ``Section''for 6.5.2.7 in TS 6.5.2.10 for Unit 1 will be replaced with the word ``Specification''to achieve consistency in the TS. Category 2 changes deal with correction of errors. TS page 3/4 3-19 forUnit 1 has two ``b'' subitems under the loss of power function unit. Thesecond ``b'' should be a ``c''. The word ``irradiated'' is not spelledcorrectly in TS 3.9.3 for Unit 1; this will be corrected. The action statementin TS 3.9.5 for Unit 1 has the word ``fo'' instead of the word ``of'',which would also be corrected. The specification number on pages 3/4 12-1,3/4 12-11, and 3/4 12-12 for the Annual Radiological Environmental OperatingReport for Unit 1 and Unit 2 should read 6.9.1.8, and not 6.9.1.11. Thespecification number on page 3/4 12-11 for the Semiannual RadiologicalEffluent Release Report for Unit 1 and Unit 2 should read 6.9.1.7, andnot 6.9.1.10. The words ``specified'' and ``operational'' on Bases pageB 2-1 for Unit 2 are not spelled correctly; this will be corrected. Actionstatements ``c'' and ``d'' for Unit 2 specification 3.3.3.6 reference Table3.3-11; the correct reference is Table 3.3-10. Fire detection instrumentsfor Unit 2 located in Table 3.3-11 have errors. For example, the two listedflame detectors are not flame detectors but are heat detectors. In addition,similar inaccuracies will be corrected. TS 4.6.1.1 for Unit 2 referencesspecification 3.6.4; the correct reference is specification 3.6.3. Thelast sentence in TS 4.7.6.1.1 for Unit 2 references specification 5.1.3,but there is no specification 5.1.3; therefore the sentence would be deleted.The first sentence under Functional Tests on page 3/4 7-22 for Unit 2 hasthe word ``last'' instead of the word ``least''; this will be corrected.Fire Zone 34 should not be included in TS 3.7.11.2 for Unit 2 because FireZone 34 never had automatic fire suppression; this was an accepted NRCdeviation. The Fire Hose Stations in Table 3.7.4 for Unit 2 would be clarifiedto better identify the Fire Hose Station locations. TS 4.7.11.4 for Unit2 requires the yard fire hydrants to be visually inspected once duringMarch, April, or May and once during September, October, or November; however,the actual months would not be specified because the climate at the St.Lucie site is characterized as subtropical marine. Lastly, TS 6.14 forUnit 2, which addresses the Offsite Dose Calculation Manual (ODCM), referencesthe PCP (Process Control Program). The reference should be the ODCM. Category 3 changes deal with outdated and fully satisfied conditions placedas footnotes in the TS. Footnote (e) for Table 3.3-1 in the Unit 1 TS isno longer applicable. The footnote for Unit 1 TS implementing the degradedgrid voltage TS prior to Cycle 7 restart on pages 3/4 3-11, 3/4 3-15, and3/4 3-19 are no longer necessary since the specifications were implementedas required. In regard to Unit 2 TS, certain sprinkler systems identifiedin TS 3.7.11.2 were to be installed and operable prior to exceeding 5%of rated thermal power. These conditions have been satisfied and the footnotespecifying this would be deleted. The licensee also proposes to delete a Unit 2 license condition. LicenseCondition 2.C.12 required the licensee to address the issue of heavy loadsin two steps: prior to startup following the first refueling outage andprior to 30 days of startup following the second refueling outage. Thefirst step was one of the subjects of a license amendment application datedJanuary 25, 1985, and the second step is one of the subjects of this licenseapplication. License Condition 2.C.12 was one of the subjects of a staffevaluation dated September 13, 1988 in support of Amendment No. 34. Thestaff found the licensee met the entire license condition and it is nolonger a part of the license. Therefore, the staff considers the licensee'srequest of deletion of the second part of License Condition 2.C.12 a mootrequest and will not take further action on it. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment toan operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerationsif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee has addressed these standards. The staff has deleted the licensee'sarguments as far as License Condition 2.C.12 is concerned, since it isno longer a part of the license. In regard the first standard, the licenseeprovided the following information: <ITAG tagnum="21">Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the changes intended to achieve consistency throughout the TechnicalSpecifications, the intent of the Specification will not be changed norwill operating limitations of the Technical Specifications be changed.For the changes which involve correction of errors in the Technical Specifications,the changes proposed are intended to solely correct typographical errorsor omissions from the Technical Specifications. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the changes which propose to delete outdated and fully satisfiedfootnotes..., the NRC Staff's evaluation of the effect of the equipmentor procedures required by footnote, and its completion to fully satisfythe Technical Specification requirement..., were previously evaluated anddetermined not to significantly affect the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated.

Based upon the above, the staff propose to determine that the proposedchanges do not involve a significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Indian River Junior CollegeLibrary, 3209 Virginia Avenue, Fort Pierce, Florida 33450 <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Harold F.

Berkow <ITAG tagnum="84">Florida Power and Light Company, et al., Docket No. 50-389, St. LuciePlant, Unit No. 2, St. Lucie County, Florida </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>September 7, 1988 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The amendment would change thevalue of Pa in Technical Specifications (TS) 3/4.6.1.1 entitled ``PrimaryContainment Integrity,'' 3/4.6.1.2 entitled ``Containment Leakage,'' and3/4.6.1.3 entitled ``Containment Air Locks.'' Pa is defined in AppendixJ (Primary Reactor Containment Leakage Testing For Water Cooled Power Reactors)to 10 CFR Part 50 as the calculated peak containment internal pressurerelated to the design basis accident. The current value of Pa is 43.4 psigand represents the Main Steam Line Break Inside Containment (MSLBIC) peakcontainment internal pressure. The proposed value of 41.8 psig representsthe Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) peak containment internal pressure.Pa is used to measure and calculate containment leakage rates in orderto assure that radiological consequences as a result of an accident willnot exceed the guidelines specified in 10 CFR Part 100. The licensee's containment leakage rate TS (3/4.6.1.2) also permit reducedpressure testing. In this case, the allowable minimum pressure is one halfof Pa. Thus, the licensee is proposing a test pressure of 20.9 psig insteadof 21.7 psig when a reduced pressure test is conducted. Again, the reducedpressure testing is using the LOCA peak pressure as its basis, insteadof the MSLBIC peak pressure. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposedamendment to an operating license for a facility involves no significanthazards considerations if operation of the facility in accordance withthe proposed amendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase inthe probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or(2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. The licensee addressed the above three standards in the amendment application.In regard to the first standard, the licensee provided the following analysis:<ITAG tagnum="21">Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed amendment change does not involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluatedbecause the primary reactor containment is designed to accommodate, withoutexceeding the design leakage rate and with sufficient margin, the calculatedpressure and temperature conditions resulting from a loss of coolant accident.This meets the requirement of 10 CFR 50 Appendix A Criterion 50 for thecontainment to retain its integrity during a loss of coolant accident.Satisfactory leak rate testing at the value of the peak calculated containmentpressure following a loss of coolant accident provides the assurance requiredby the design basis 3/4.6.1.1 - Containment Integrity, that any releaseof radioactive materials will be restricted to that assumed in the safetyanalysis. The probability or consequences of an accident are not significantlyincreased because there is no change to the containment design basis northe ability of the containment to perform the required function of preventingthe release of radioactivity to the environment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In connection to the second standard, the licensee stated: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Use of the modified specification would not create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The use of this modified specification cannot create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated sincethe design features of the primary reactor containment as required by Criterion16 of 10 CFR 50 Appendix A are not altered. The testing at the calculatedpeak accident pressure during a loss of coolant accident demonstrates thatthe reactor containment and associated systems provide an essentially leak-tightbarrier against the uncontrolled release of radioactivity to the environment.No new failure mode is introduced due to the change of test pressure, sincethe assurance of integrity at the calculated accident pressure is maintainedby testing at the value. </ITAG>With regard to the third standard, the licensee provides the followingrationale: <ITAG tagnum="21">Use of the modified specification would not involve significant reductionin a margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The existing test pressure using the calculated peak pressure valuefor the main steam line break (MSLB) tests the containment to a higherpressure than is required. This could be considered as providing a greatermargin of safety since testing at approximately 104% of calculated accidentpeak value insures [sic] that the actual pressure stress is accommodated.However, there is no requirement for the test pressure to be higher thanthe calculated design basis accident peak pressure. For purposes of protectionfrom radiological releases, the peak loss of coolant accident (LOCA) pressureis appropriate and the peak MSLB pressure is not appropriate. As shownin St. Lucie Unit 2 Tables 15.0-4a and 15.6.6-12 the radiological consequencesof a LOCA produce a minimum of 675 times the site boundary dosage as theinside containment MSLB. Article NE-3112.1 - Design Pressure, of 1986 ASMEBoiler and Pressure Vessel Code, states that the design internal pressureshall not be less than 100% of the maximum containment internal pressureunder conditions for which the containment function is required, i.e.,LOCA event. Prior to being placed in service, the containment was successfullytested by being pressurized to 50 psig which verified the design pressureof 44 psig. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, the modified specification which establishes the peak accidentcontainment pressure corresponding to the actual accident requiring containmentintegrity does not reduce any margin of safety. The containment vesselstructural integrity requirement of Technical Specification 3/4.6.1.6 ismet in that the design pressure of 44 psig is greater than 100% of the41.8 psig which is the condition for which the containment function isrequired. Furthermore, this Technical Specification considers the higherMSLB pressure (43.4 psig) in the determination of containment structuralintegrity. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationdetermination analysis. Based upon this review, the staff believes thatthe licensee has met the three standards. The staff adds the following considerations in support of a no significanthazards consideration determination. The containment internal design pressureis 44 psig and the design leak rate is 0.50 percent by weight of the containmentair per day. These design values will not be affected by the proposed change.The peak allowable (during operation) primary containment pressure of +0.40psig (TS 3/4.6.1.4) will not change and coupled with the MSLBIC peak pressureof 43.4 psig or the LOCA peak pressure of 41.8 psig will ensure that thecontainment vessel will remain within its 44 psig design value, as specifiedin Section 5.2 of the TS entitled ``Containment - Design Pressure and Temperature.''The maximum allowable leak rate is a TS value (3/4.6.1.2 - ContainmentLeakage) and this will not change, as a result of the licensee's proposedchange. The proposed change to Pa will not change the accident analyses and resultantradiological consequences for the postulated LOCA and MSLBIC accident.In the case of a LOCA, the radiological consequences are within the guidelinesof 10 CFR Part 100. The significant containment parameter for this analysisis the containment leakage rate and this will not change. Implicit withthe containment leakage rate is the associated peak containment pressureassociated with the LOCA. The use of the LOCA peak pressure for Pa willensure that the leakage rate is measured and calculated appropriately.In the case of a MSLBIC, the radiological consequences are well withinthe guidelines of 10 CFR Part 100. The licensee stated that (1) the LOCAtypical dose is 675 times the MSLB thyroid dose and 2.6 x 105 times theMSLB whole body dose at the site boundary for the 0 to 2 hour dose calculations,and (2) the total event comparison shows an even larger difference. Thesignificant containment parameter for this analysis is the containmentleakage rate and this will not change. Implicit with the containment leakagerate is the associated MSLBIC peak containment pressure. Although the licenseewill now use the LOCA peak pressure for Pa instead of the MSLBIC peak pressure,this will not significantly affect the radiological consequences whichare much smaller for the MSLBIC case versus the LOCA case. Based upon the above discussion, the staff proposes to determine that theproposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Indian River Junior CollegeLibrary, 3209 Virginia Avenue, Fort Pierce, Florida 33450 <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Harold F.

These P/T limits take the form of parametriccurves which define the permissible operating envelope during reactor heatup,cooldown, criticality, and inservice leak and hydrostatic testing. Becausethe P/T limits are based partly on the most limiting nil-ductility temperaturefor the reactor vessel, it is necessary to periodically revise the limitsto account for the effects of irradiation and other factors on the nil-ductilitytemperature. The P/T limits currently in the TS are applicable up to 10effective full power years (EFPY). The proposed change will replace theseP/T curves with revised curves applicable up to 20 EFPY. The Turkey Pointreactor pressure vessel surveillance program provides updated materialsdata for refining the estimated effects of irradiation on the nil-ductilitytemperature. In addition to the proposed modification of P/T limits, the amendmentswould also convert the TS to the standard format and revise the ``Bases''section to be consistent with the revised P/T curves. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)).

The licensee has evaluated the proposed change in accordance with the standardsof 10 CFR 50.92 and has determined that operation of Turkey Point Units3 and 4 in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: <ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The pressure/temperature (P/T) limit curves in the Technical Specificationsare conservatively generated in accordance with the fracture toughnessrequirements of 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix G as supplemented by AppendixG of Section III of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code.

Example (i) relates to a purelyadministrative change to Technical Specifications: for example, a changeto achieve consistency throughout the Technical Specifications, correctionof an error, or a change in nomenclature. The proposed change reformattingthe existing requirements in TS 3.1.2 is similar to example (i) in thatit is an administrative change which states the requirements in a formatconsistent with that of the Standard Technical Specifications and doesnot involve technical or plant modifications. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would pose no threat to the public health and safety, and wouldnot involve a significant hazards consideration. </ITAG>The staff notes that the licensee has determined the new P/T limits usingthe latest staff guidance in Regulatory Guide 1.99, Revision 2, dated May1988. It is routine for licensees to refine their P/T limit curves basedon the latest information available from reactor vessel materials surveillanceprograms. The revisions to the curves appear to be modest and are basedon more data than were available when the 10 EFPY curves were developed.The changes in format are administrative in nature and, therefore, haveno affect on the public health and safety. The revised ``Bases'' reflectthe new P/T curves and provide a better understanding for the specificTS but do not impact the plant configuration or operation. For these reasons,and those given (above) by the licensee, the staff agrees with the licensee'sdetermination, and therefore proposes to determine that the amendmentsdo not involve a significant hazard consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Environmental and Urban AffairsLibrary, Florida International University, Miami, Florida 33199 <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Harold F.

The proposed amendment would modify paragraph 2.E.of Facility Operating License No. NPF-68 to require compliance with therevised Plan. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>On August 4, 1986 (51 FR 27817 and 27822), the Nuclear RegulatoryCommission amended Part 73 of its regulations, ``Physical Protection ofPlants and Materials,'' to clarify plant security requirements to affordan increased assurance of plant safety. The amended regulations requiredthat each nuclear power reactor licensee submit proposed amendments toits security plan to implement the revised provisions of 10 CFR 73.55.The licensee submitted its revised plan on March 27 and November 24, 1987,and January 6, 1988, to satisfy the requirements of the amended regulations.The Commission proposes to amend the license to reference the revised plan.In the Supplementary Materials accompanying the amended regulations, theCommission indicated that it was amending its regulations ``to providea more safety conscious safeguards system while maintaining the currentlevels of protection'' and that the ``Commission believes that the clarificationand refinement of requirements as reflected in these amendments is appropriatebecause they afford an increased assurance of plant safety.'' The Commission has provided guidance concerning the application of thecriteria for determining whether a significant hazards consideration existsby providing certain examples of actions involving no significant hazardsconsiderations (51 FR 7750). One of these examples of actions involvingno significant hazards considerations is example (vii) ``A change to conforma license to changes in the regulations, where the license change resultsin very minor changes to facility operations clearly in keeping with theregulations.'' The changes in this case fall within the scope of the example.For the foregoing reasons, the Commission proposes to determine that theproposed amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Burke County Public Library,412 Fourth Street, Waynesboro, Georgia 30830. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Mr. Arthur H.

The revision clarifies that ResidualHeat Removal Cold Leg Injection Valves HV-8809A and HV-8809B may be temporarilyclosed in Mode 3 during leakage testing of reactor coolant system pressureisolation check valves. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The proposed change specifies that valves HV-8809A and B may be temporarilyclosed in Mode 3 during leak testing of Reactor Coolant System (RCS) pressureisolation check valves. Leak testing of these check valves is requiredfollowing each refueling outage, following valve realignment or maintenance,and prior to entering Mode 2 following a cold shutdown of 72 hours or more(if not tested in the previous 9 months). The optimum plant condition forleak testing of the pressure isolation check valves is Mode 3 at full RCSpressure, just prior to entering Mode 2. At this point, valve disturbancesare complete and better seating of the check valves will produce more meaningfultest results. The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR Part 50.92. A proposedamendment to an operating license for a facility involves no significanthazards consideration if operation of the facility in accordance with aproposed amendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in theprobability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2)create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from anyaccident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction ina margin of safety. In regard to the proposed amendment, the licensee has determined the following:<ITAG tagnum="21">1. The proposed change will not significantly increase the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Closure of valvesHV-8809A and B to allow RCS pressure isolation check valve testing in Mode3 has no impact on any mechanism that could potentially cause a loss ofcoolant accident (LOCA). The probability of a LOCA is therefore not increased.The consequences of a LOCA occurring with either HV-8809A or B closed arebounded by previous analyses of a LOCA in Mode 3 with portions of the emergencycore cooling system (ECCS) disabled. Those previous analyses were performedassuming flow was available from one residual heat removal (RHR) pump,one intermediate head safety injection (SI) pump, and one high head chargingpump. Further, the analyses assumed that automatic SI actuation on lowpressurizer pressure was blocked; thus, only automatic SI actuation oncontainment high pressure was available. In actuality, during leak testingof the pressure isolation check valves, all ECCS pumps and accumulators(above 1000 psig) are available. In addition, automatic SI actuation onlow pressurizer pressure is available above approximately 1900 psig whenthe operator unblocks this signal. The analyses showed that adequate ECCSflow was available to meet core cooling requirements and that the ECCSdesign and licensing bases were satisfied. The consequences of a LOCA are,therefore, not increased. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new ordifferent kind of accident than any accident previously evaluated. Thechange does not introduce any new equipment into the plant or require anyexisting equipment to operate in a different manner from which it was designedto operate. The change, therefore, does not create a new failure mode,and a new or different kind of accident could not result. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The proposed change does not significantly reduce a margin of safety.The change has no effect on safety limits or limiting safety system settings.Probabilistic analyses have shown that RHR or low head SI unavailabilitiesare not significantly increased by periodic, temporary closures of valvesHV-8809A and B for pressure isolation check valve leak testing. Marginsof safety are, therefore, not significantly reduced. </ITAG>The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's determination and concurs withits findings. Accordingly, the Commission proposes to determine that the proposed changeinvolves no significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Burke County Public Library,412 Fourth Street, Waynesboro, Georgia 30830. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Mr. Arthur H.

The proposed revision is based on the fact that the chlorine hazardis being removed from the site, i.e., all liquid chlorine is being removedfrom the site and there are no other significant depots of chlorine withina five mile radius of the site. Furthermore, there is negligible transportationof chlorine in the vicinity of the site. The licensees intend to replace the existing chlorination system on siteand at the site sewage treatment plant, the only other location withina five-mile radius of the control room in which chlorine is stored, witha sodium hypochlorite or equivalent system that obviates the use of liquidchlorine for water treatment. Thus, the threat to control room habitabilityfrom an accidental release of chlorine on site will be removed. <T3>Basis for Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination:</T3>The staff has evaluated this proposed amendment and determined thatit involves no significant hazards considerations.

The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated because deleting theOperability and Surveillance requirements for the chlorine detection systemis contingent upon the removal of all major depots or storage tanks ofchlorine that constitute a hazard as described in Regulatory Position C.1of Regulatory Guide 1.78. This, in conjunction with the negligible riskassociated with a transportation accident in the vicinity of Clinton (asdetermined according to the guidelines of Regulatory Position C.2 of Reg.Guide 1.78), makes the probability or consequences of a chlorine accidentnegligible for Clinton. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because the associatedplant modification for converting to a sodium hypochlorite or equivalentsystem only affects the means by which the water is chlorinated and hasno direct impact on the design or operation of plant systems other thanthe chlorination system itself. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a marginof safety because the margin of safety with respect to a chlorine gas releasehas been maximized by removal of chlorine gas from the site. The only safetycontribution of the chlorine detection system was in the detection of chlorinerelease. With no chlorine source present, deletion of the chlorine detectionsystem can not affect the margin of safety. For the reasons stated above, the staff believes this proposed amendmentinvolves no significant hazards considerations. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Vespasian Warner Public Library,120 West Johnson Street, Clinton, Illinois 61727 <T3>Attorney for licensees: </T3>Sheldon Zabel, Esq., Schiff, Hardin andWaite, 7200 Sears Tower, 233 Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60606 <T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>Daniel R.

The proposedchanges update the fuel thermal limits of Section 3.12 and upgrade thefuel cladding integrity Safety Limit of Section 1.1.A. As new fuel bundle types are added to the reactor core, the design basisLoss-Of-Coolant Accident (LOCA) must be reanalyzed and the Technical Specificationsupdated to include the operating limits of these new bundle types. As partof the reload for Cycle 10, General Electric Company (GE) has reanalyzedthe design basis event for the new bundle type being added to the core.The TS revision will add the Maximum Average Planar Linear Heat GenerationRate (MAPLHGR) operating limits for the new bundle type. Also as part of the reload licensing process for Cycle 10, GE has reanalyzedthe most limiting abnormal operational transients as specified in Table15.0-1 in the updated DAEC Final Safety Analysis Report. The TS changewill revise the Minimum Critical Power Ratio (MCPR) operating limits, basedon this analysis, for all fuel types to be used in Cycle 10 operation.The new fuel assemblies being added to the core are the advanced GE8X8EBdesign. The NRC staff previously approved this fuel design and revisedMCPR operating limits in amendments to the GE Standard Application forReactor Fuel (GESTAR-II). In addition, various administrative changes are being made, such as revisingfigure numbers, updating the Table of Contents, and renumbering pages.<T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards (10 CFR 50.92(c)) for determiningwhether a significant hazards consideration exists.

Therefore it will not involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The administrative changes will not involve significant increasesin the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The proposed change will not create the possibility of a new ordifferent kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated becausethe facility is not being changed except for the introduction of the higherenrichment fuel.

This change is necessary because the licenseeintends to modify the power supplies to these systems from a 120/240 VACsplit-phase system to a Class 1E, 120 VAC single-phase system, in orderto meet Regulatory Guide 1.97 (Revision 2) requirements. The licensee also proposes other administrative changes, including deletionof a surveillance requirement that was unintentionally retained in theTechnical Specifications in a previous license amendment. <T3>Basis for proposed no siqnificant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards (10 CFR 50.92(c)) for determiningwhether a significant hazards consideration exists.

The licensee has evaluated this proposed Technical Specification changeand has concluded:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) This proposed amendment does not involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.The change will permit the installation of upgraded power supplies forthe Uninterruptib1e AC and Instrument AC electrical systems. The functionof the Uninterruptible AC and Instrument AC undervoltage relays is to providea signal for control room annunciators when a degraded voltage conditionor loss of power to these systems is sensed. This function remains unchanged.Conversion of the power supplies from a 120/240 VAC split-phase systemto a 120 VAC single phase system requires changing the undervoltage relaysfrom 240 VAC (rated voltage) relays to 120 VAC (rated voltage) relays,and therefore the undervoltage relay setpoints must be changed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The changes will not alter the function of any equipment that is poweredby the Uninterruptible AC or Instrument AC electrical systems. Both systemswill continue to have the same number of alternate power sources. However,the improved technology and Class 1E (as defined by IEEE Standard 323)qualification of the new power supply systems will improve the reliabilityas compared to the existing power supplies. Therefore the probability ofan accident previously evaluated is not increased. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The consequences of accidents previously evaluated in the Final SafetyAnalysis Report (FSAR) are not increased. A loss of power to the UninterruptibleAC and Instrument AC electrical systems cannot be caused by the annunciatorsetpoint changes. The setpoint changes will not degrade operator responseand a failure of the new power supplies is no worse than failure of theexisting power supplies. Failure of existing power supplies for the UninterruptibleAC and Instrument AC electrical systems was previously analyzed in theDAEC FSAR and these analyses will remain unchanged by the proposed TS changes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) This proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. The setpointchanges for the Uninterruptible AC and Instrument AC electrical systemundervoltage relays will not change the function of these relays (to activatea control room annunciator when bus voltage is degraded or power to thebus is lost). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The undervoltage relays for the Uninterruptible AC and InstrumentAC electrical systems do not provide any automatic trip, automatic transfer,or initiation signals to any equipment that mitigates an accident, norare the relays an accident initiator. The setpoint changes will not adverselyaffect the performance of the new power supplies or any of the loads connectedto the busses. The new setpoints were determined using a methodology similarto that used to establish the existing setpoints and are consistent withvendor recommendations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) This amendment does not involve a reduction in a margin of safetybecause the change involves on1y an annunciator setpoint. The operationor reliability of the Instrument AC and Uninterruptible AC electrical systemswill not be degraded and none of the system loads will be adversely affectedby this setpoint change. There are no automatic functions associated withthese undervoltage relays and the annunciator function remains unchanged.The new setpoints were determined using a methodology similar to that usedto establish the existing setpoints and are consistent with vendor recommendations.Consequently, control room operator response is judged not to be degradedor impaired by the revised setpoints. Therefore, no margin of safety isaffected by this change. </ITAG>The proposed administrative changes will not increase the probability orthe consequences of any previously analyzed accident, introduce any newaccident, or reduce an existing margin of safety.

In addition, administrative errors in Tables3.2-F, 3.2-H and 4.2-F would be corrected to reflect actual plant conditions.The proposed amendment would implement changes that were approved by theNRC staff as part of the licensee's Detailed Control Room Design Review(DCRDR). As part of the DCRDR program, the range for measurement of containmentwater level would be revised to reflect the actual height of the containmentpenetration at which measurements are made and read (only positive values).This would allow a direct comparison between containment and torus waterlevel. In addition, the containment water level instrument would be relocatedto Table 3.2-H to facilitate use by operators and would be added to Table4.2-H to assure the surveillance requirements are met. Notations wouldbe added to Table 3.2-H to clarify that torus water level is the primaryindication and that containment water level is solely a backup indication.The stated range of torus water level measurement would be altered to reflectthe actual height of the level instrument and torus penetrations. The reducedrange would meet all criteria specified in the Regulatory Guide 1.97 andFSAR Section 6.2.1.5 and would be more accurate and indicative of actualtorus water level. In addition, descriptions in Table 4.2-F would be changedfrom Suppression Chamber Temperature and Water Level to Torus Water Temperatureand Water Level, respectively, for nomenclature consistency. The stated ranges of instruments for torus water temperature (Table 3.2-F)and drywell pressure (Table 3.2-H) would be revised to correct errors.Local indicators for drywell and torus pressure in Tables 3.2-F and 4.2-Fwould be deleted to complete the removal of the drywell/torus differentialpressure system from the Technical Specifications.

The requirement for toruswater level indication, as specified in Section 6.2.1.5 of the FSAR andRegulatory Guide 1.97, remains satisfied. Relocating the containment waterlevel instrument from Table 3.2-F to Table 3.2-H improves consistency andhuman factors of the TS.

Licensee changesto the FSAR listing shall be made in accordance with 10 CFR 50.59 and approvedby the Plant Operations Review Committee. In addition, certain manual valves that could be opened during operationare retained in Technical Specifications. Technical Specification Table3.6-2 allowed periodic opening of these valves during modes 1 through 4for various reasons, as long as they remained administratively controlledto specify rapid closure under accident conditions. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Millstone Unit 3 TSs currently contain a number of equipment liststhat are the subject of Limiting Conditions for Operation (LCOs) and SurveillanceRequirements (SR). In each case, these lists only contain equipment identificationsand no other LCO/SR related information, (e.g., trip setpoints) are involved.The licensee has proposed that the equipment lists contained in TS Tables3.6-2 be incorporated and maintained in the Millstone Unit 3 FSAR. In the event that changes are needed to the information to be containedin the FSAR, the proposed changes would be evaluated in accordance withthe process detailed in 10 CFR 50.59 and approved by the Plant OperationsReview Committee. The licensee has also proposed removing references tothe Table in the subject TS but otherwise, the LCOs and SRs would remainunchanged.

The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). We have reviewed the licensee's proposed changes to the TS and concludethat the proposed changes will not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability of occurrence orconsequences of an accident previously analyzed. Since there are no proposedchanges to the LCO or SR, no changes in operability of the subject equipmentwill occur. Accordingly, there will be no effect on previously analyzedaccident.

Since there are no changes in the way the plantis operated, the potential for an unanalyzed accident is not created. Nonew failure modes are introduced.

As discussed in the staff's Safety Evaluation Report (SER) related to theoperation of Limerick Generating Station, Units 1 and 2, NUREG-0991, thestaff concluded that the Limerick Containment Isolation System met therequirements of General Design Criterion 56 except in certain instancespertaining to the Hydrogen Recombiners, the Drywell Chilled Water System(DCW) and the Reactor Enclosure Cooling Water Systems (RECW). The staff'sposition was that a second containment isolation valve was required inthe lines to and from the Hydrogen Recombiners penetrating containment.For the RECW and DCW, the staff's position was that the remote-manual isolationvalves should be replaced with automatic isolation valves with diverseisolation signals. This applied to the RECW inboard and outboard isolationvalves and the DCW outboard isolation valves in all the supply and returnlines. When Facility Operating License NPF-39 was issued, it contained Conditions(10) and (11) requiring that the above modifications be installed priorto startup following the first refueling outage.

There are four diesel generatorsat Peach Bottom common to Unit 2 and Unit 3. Each is housed in a separateroom of the Diesel Generator Building. The fifth room of the Diesel GeneratorBuilding, the Cardox room, houses the Cardox system carbon dioxide storagetank, refrigeration equipment, master selector valves and batteries thatprovide back up power to the Cardox control components. This room alsocontains pumps and fans unrelated to the Cardox system. The original Cardox system was not classified as safety related or seismic.Yet, this system provides a trip signal to diesel generators upon Cardoxactuation. This trip exists because each diesel generator engine drawscombustion air from within its room. Consequently, in the event of a fireand carbon dioxide discharge into a diesel generator room, the diesel enginewould draw in carbon dioxide. This could result in loss of the diesel dueto suffocation of the engine, and reduction of the carbon dioxide concentrationin the room to the point where the fire may not be extinguished. A dieselgenerator is therefore tripped by the Cardox system when the system actuatesin its room. There presently are four combination fixed temperature andrate-of-rise heat detectors in each diesel room. Only one of the four heatdetectors in the room needs to actuate to initiate a Cardox discharge anddiesel generator trip. This is not in conformance with the design. TheFSAR and other design documents and drawings specify that two of the fourdetectors need to actuate to initiate the system; however, it was recentlydiscovered that the installation is such that any one detector can initiatethe system. A diesel generator is not affected by Cardox actuation in anotherdiesel generator room. A diesel generator trip signal resulting from AutomaticCardox actuation is not blocked when indications of a loss of offsite powerare present, but is blocked by a loss of coolant accident (LOCA) signal.The proposed modification will eliminate the possibility of a common modeseismic-induced actuation of the Cardox system and/or diesel generatortrips by replacing the current Cardox system controls and heat detectorswith seismically qualified, safety related components. This will also reducethe probability of a spurious Cardox actuation and/or diesel generatortrip due to Cardox component failure. The diesel generator Cardox actuationtrip will be retained and the automatic actuation of Cardox will stillbe blocked by a LOCA signal. In each diesel generator room the four heatdetectors will be replaced with sixteen seismically qualified, safety relatedrate compensation heat detectors at eight locations, referred to as ``zones.''To activate a carbon dioxide discharge and trip the diesel generator, bothdetectors in any one zone must actuate. This minimizes the possibilityof inadvertent carbon dioxide system actuation due to a detector failure,but does not inhibit quick detection because the detectors in a zone willbe located in close proximity to each other. The revised layout ensuresthat a fast developing fire will be quickly detected. A fast developing,high heat output fire is the most likely type to occur in a diesel roombecause the prominent combustibles in the rooms are oil and diesel fuel.The licensee proposes that the Technical Specifications be revised to reflectan increased number of detectors in each diesel generator room and therevised detection logic scheme. Currently, Limiting Condition of Operation(LCO) 3.14.B.3 requires that four heat detectors in each diesel generatorroom be operable, but permits one of the four detectors to be inoperablefor no more than seven days without compensatory measures. Licensee proposesto change LCO 3.14.B.3 such that it requires that sixteen new detectors(two in each of eight zones) to be operable when the diesel generatorsare required to be operable, except that one detector or both detectorsin one zone of the eight zones may be inoperable for no more than sevendays without compensatory measures. Also, Licensee proposes that Table3.14.C.1 be revised to include the new detector numbers, and that the Baseson page 240q be amended to clarify the minimum number of detectors requiredto be operable. The proposed LCO for the new heat detectors is at least as restrictiveas the current LCO. Currently, if one of the four heat detectors in a roomis inoperable for more than seven days, compensatory measures are required.The licensee is proposing that compensatory measures be required if onedetector or both detectors in one zone of the eight zones in a room isinoperable. With one pair in a room inoperable, the remaining seven pairsof detectors (fourteen detectors in total) provide at least as much firedetection capability as three of the four original heat detectors. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)).

Previous licensingaccident analyses assumed that systems which could trip the diesel generatorswere classified as safety related; thus, the proposed upgrades to the CardoxSystem will assure that the plant configuration is as assumed in previousanalyses. Because the diesel generators are intended only to mitigate theconsequences of an accident and have no impact on the probability of occurrenceof an accident, the probability of an accident is not increased by theproposed changes. The design deficiencies will be corrected while maintainingor enhancing the level of fire protection. The proposed upgrades replacenon-safety related non-seismic components with safety related seismicallyqualified components functionally similar to the original components.

Butler <ITAG tagnum="84">Philadelphia Electric Company, Public Service Electric and Gas Company,Delmarva Power and Light Company, and Atlantic City Electric Company, DocketsNos. 50-277 and 50-278, Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, Units Nos. 2and 3, York County, Pennsylvania </ITAG><T3>Date of application for amendments: </T3>September 7, 1988 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The proposed amendment wouldmodify the Technical Specifications to correct deficiencies in the degradedvoltage protection features. The deficiencies were identified as a resultof revised voltage regulation studies. The studies were based in part onthe consideration that, under certain offsite power emergency conditions,the voltage provided to the station's offsite power supply transformerscould be lower than previously assumed. The study also modeled the plant'spower distribution system to a greater level of detail. The proposed changes are grouped into two categories. The Category A changesaddress the degraded grid protection relays, and involve increasing thetime delay for the 4.16kV bus or the emergency power system to transferto an alternate power supply and decreasing the voltage setpoint on theinstantaneous undervoltage relays on the 4.16kV buses. Category B changesaddress the Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) loading sequence. The Category A changes involve two independent offsite power sources whichare referred to as the start-up sources. The 4160 volt (4.16kV) bus feederbreakers provide the interface between the two offsite power sources andthe plant safety-related AC power distribution system. Each of the four4.16kV buses in each unit can be powered by either of the two offsite powersupplies. Each of the 4.16kV buses can also be powered from a safety relateddiesel generator. Each startup source to each 4.16kV bus is equipped with an instantaneousundervoltage protective relay. Each relay is presently set to initiateat 90% of nominal voltage on the 4.16kV bus. The purpose of these relaysis to ensure that adequate levels of voltage are provided to the motorsand control components which are powered from the 480V motor control centers(MCCs) which are fed from the 4.16kV buses. The degraded grid protectiverelays initiate time delay relays which transfer the 4.16KV bus to an alternatesupply source if the normal supply source does not recover to the instantaneousrelay reset value (currently 93%) in a set period of time. The controlcircuit logic to the time delay relays distinguishes between an undervoltagecondition without a safety injection signal and one concurrent with a safetyinjection signal. Without a safety injection signal, a time delay relaywill initiate the transfer 60 seconds after initiation of the instantaneousrelay if the voltage does not recover. With a safety injection signal,another time delay relay will initiate the transfer 6 seconds after initiationof the instantaneous relay if the voltage does not recover. The purposeof the 6 second delay is to minimize the time that safety-related equipmentis exposed to the undervoltage condition, yet allow the voltage to recoverfrom the dips caused by acceleration of the large safety-related motors.In either case, if the voltage of the normal supply has not recovered beforethe time delay relays initiate the transfer, the associated source breakeris tripped and the bus is loaded onto an alternate power supply. The alternatesupply for any 4.16kV bus is, in order of preference, the remaining offsitepower source, then the emergency diesel generator. The revised voltageregulation study identified that under the scenario of a safety injectionsignal on one unit while operating with only one of two offsite power sources(permitted for 7 days by Limiting Condition for Operation 3.9.B.1), theexisting 6 seconds time delay setting is adequate. The existing 6 secondswould not allow sufficient acceleration time for the core spray pump motors.Therefore, even after a 6 second delay, the core spray pump motors, whichare currently started simultaneously, will not be at rated speed (basedon design acceleration versus voltage values) thereby not allowing voltagerecovery on the 4.16kV buses, and all four 4.16kV bus feeder breakers willtrip, thus loading each bus onto its associated diesel generator. Thiswould represent a reduction in defense in depth since it is desirable,if offsite power is available, to supply these loads from the offsite powersupply without reliance on the backup diesel generators. The licensee hasidentified two categories of changes to address this concern. The CategoryA changes deal with the offsite power source and include the following:(1) Revise Technical Specification Table 3.2.B on page 71a to designatethe trip level setting for the instantaneous relays as ``89% of rated voltage27 0.30% of setting (3702 volts 27 11 volts)'' instead of ``90% (+/-2%)of rated voltage,'' and replace the ``(ITE)'' in the trip function columnwith ``(27N)''; (2) Revise Table 3.2.B on page 71a to designate the triplevel setting for the time delay relays as ``9 second (+/-7%) time delay''instead of ``6 second (+/-5%) time delay''; (3) Revises BASES section 3.2on page 93a to reflect the two changes above. The Category B changes deal with revising the scheme for the sequentialloading of the residual heat removal (RHR) and the core spray (CS) pumps.The four CS pumps and the four RHR pumps of the Emergency Core CoolingSystem (ECCS) are powered from the 4.16kV buses. In the event of a LOCAwith offsite power available, the RHR and CS pumps are loaded sequentiallyonto the 4.16kV buses to preclude severe voltage transients from the simultaneousstarting of the pumps. The present loading sequence for the RHR and CSpumps in the event of a safety injection signal with offsite power availableresults in voltage dips on the 4.16kV and 480V buses which are unacceptablein consideration of the degraded grid protective relay settings due tocore spray pump motor acceleration time. Therefore, the licensee proposesa revised loading sequence for a safety injection signal with offsite poweravailable as follows: (1) Revise Table 3.2.B on page 67 to designate theinitiation setpoint for the A and C core spray pumps to be ``13 sec. +/-7%of setting'' and the initiation setpoint for the B and D core spray pumpsto be ``23 sec. +/-7% of setting''; (2) Revise Table 3.2.B on page 67 todesignate the initiation setpoint for the A and B LPCI pumps to be ``2sec. +/-7% of setting'' and the initiation setpoint for the C and D LPCIpumps to be ``8 sec. +/-7% of setting''; (3) Revise Table 3.2.B on page67 of the Unit 3 Technical Specifications only to delete the asterisk nextto the ADS Bypass Timer and the footnote which reads ``Effective when modificationassociated with this amendment is complete.'' In addition to the proposed ECCS loading sequence, the licensee will furtherimprove the voltage regulation of the 480V load centers during a motorstarting transient by a combination of plant modifications which revisethe load shedding or sequencing of the emergency service water pumps, theemergency cooling water pump, the RHR compartment coolers, the coolingtowers and the diesel generator vent supply fans. The licensee plans toperform these changes pursuant to 10 CFR 50.59 since none involves an unreviewedsafety question or a change to the Technical Specifications. The AppendixK (ECCS Evaluation Models) analysis was used to determine bounding allowablestarting times for the RHR and CS pumps. For change Request (1), the licenseeconcluded that the proposed increases in the core spray timer settingsare within the Appendix K analysis. Success of the core spray system requirestwo factors: (1) pump ready for rated flow and (2) injection valve opento permit full flow. There are two conditions required to support worstcase valve opening; reactor pressure is at the low end of its low pressurepermissive (400-500 psig) and power is available to the valve operator.Under the limiting scenario, the low pressure permissive occurs 47 secondsfollowing occurrence of the LOCA. Power to the injection valves is notinterrupted in this scenario and the valve stroke time is 12 seconds. Theearliest that the injection valve can be opened, therefore, is 59 seconds,and the pumps must be ready for full flow prior to this time. The seriesof events contributing to the establishment of the pumps ready for ratedflow are the sensor times for detection of the LOCA, the time for powerto be available at the emergency bus, the time for power to be availableto the pump motor and pump motor acceleration time. As stated previously,an assumption of the current Appendix K analysis of record is that thetime available to start and accelerate the CS pumps from the offsite sourcesis 59 seconds. Taking into account the above equipment operational timerequirements, the CS timer setting must be less than 47 seconds. Thus,the proposed 13 and 23 second timer settings are within the analyzed condition.For Change Request (2), the licensee has similarly concluded that the proposedincreases in RHR pump timer settings are in accordance with the AppendixK analysis. Success of the low pressure coolant injection (LPCI) mode ofthe RHR system requires three factors: (1) pump ready for rated flow, (2)injection valve open to permit full flow and (3) full closure of the recirculationdischarge valve. Under the limiting scenario, 57 seconds are availablefor the RHR pumps to start and accelerate to rated speed. The 57 secondsare derived from the time to reach the low pressure permissive to closethe reactor recirculation discharge valve plus the full stroke closuretime of the recirculation discharge valve. The series of events for theRHR pumps ready for rated flow are similar to the series of events forthe CS pumps. Taking into account the sensor and acceleration delays, theRHR timer setting must be less than 50.9 seconds. Thus, the proposed 2and 8 second timer settings are within the analyzed condition. NeitherChange Request involves additional loading onto the DC system. All replacementand additional relays resulting from these changes will be located in existingsafety-related panels. The control relays provided will equal or exceedthe ratings of the existing relays and meet the applicable design requirementsfor environmental and seismic qualification. Change Request (3) is proposed to the Unit 3 Technical Specifications onlyto delete a footnote which is no longer required since the modificationassociated with the ADS bypass timer (Modification 633) was completed forUnit 3 on February 24, 1986. Removing the footnote will eliminate the needto check the status of the modification to determine the applicabilityof the specification. The licensee proposes this administrative changeto enhance safety by reducing the effort required to interpret the specification.<T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92.

These changes also reflect the organizational changesrecently approved by the NRC (License Amendment Nos. 132 and 135) whichwill ensure that the primary authority for approval of working hour exceedanceis with the appropriate level of site management. Thus, management controland awareness of the overtime work status will be elevated thereby ensuringthat control of working hours for personnel involved with safety-relatedactivities is maintained. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Standard 2 - </T3>The proposed changes do not create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluatedbecause they increase control over working hours and the attendant reductionin personnel fatigue. These changes thereby enhance the capability of plantpersonnel to maintain the status of systems and operational parameterswithin the envelope of acceptable conditions required by established proceduresand regulations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Standard 3 - </T3>The changes do not involve a significant reductionin the margin of safety since the addition of work hour restrictions reducesthe likelihood of personnel error in activities related to nuclear safety.To the contrary, the margin of safety in mitigating the consequences ofan accident as evaluated in Chapter 14 of the PBAPS Updated Final SafetyAnalysis Report will be increased as a result of the overtime work restrictions.</ITAG>The staff has reviewed the licensees' no significant hazards considerationdetermination and agrees with the licensees' analysis. In addition to the licensee's analysis provided above, the staff notesthat the Commission has provided guidance concerning the application ofthe standards for determining whether license amendments involve no significanthazards considerations by providing certain examples (51 FR 7751). Oneof the examples (ii) of actions involving no significant hazards considerationis a change that constitutes an additional limitation, restriction, orcontrol not presently included in the Technical Specifications. The proposedchanges, specifically the addition of restrictions on working hours, requirementsfor administrative procedures and the approval authority for controllingworking hours are additional limitations not presently included in theTechnical Specifications and are therefore within the scope of the example.Accordingly, on the basis of the staff's review of the licensee's determinationand on the basis that the proposed change is encompassed by an examplefor which no significant hazards consideration exists, the staff has madea proposed determination that the application involves no significant hazardsconsideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Government Publications Section,State Library of Pennsylvania, Education Building, Commonwealth and WalnutStreets, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania 17126 <T3>Attorney for Licensee: </T3>Troy B.

The licensee has evaluated the proposed amendment against the standardsof 10 CFR 50.92, and has determined the following: <ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed change is a more restrictive limitation not presentlyincluded in the Trojan Technical Specifications. Applying more restrictivetest criteria to the Reactor Coolant System (RCS) pressure isolation valvesprovides greater assurance of valve integrity, thereby reducing the probabilityand the consequences of an accident. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The accident of concern is referred to as an intersystem Loss-of-CoolantAccident (LOCA) which involves excessive leakage from a high pressure system(the RCS) to a lower pressure system [the Emergency Core Cooling System(ECCS)]. To adequately monitor the integrity of the high/low pressure interface(i.e., two in-series check valves), the Technical Specifications providesurveillance requirements and associated leak-rate limits on these checkvalves. The proposed change requires that leakage data acquired at differentialpressures lower than the function maximum value be adjusted upward to correspondto the function maximum differential pressure values. The proposed revisioninvolves no physical alterations of Plant configurations or changes tosetpoints or operating parameters and, therefore, does not create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed change will improve the margin of safety by requiringthat observed leakage rates are conservatively adjusted to the higher functionmaximum differential pressure values when testing at lower differentialpressures. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards analysis andconcurs with the licensee's conclusions.

FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant, Oswego, New York </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>August 24, 1988 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The proposed amendment wouldrevise the Technical Specifications (TS) to reflect a dual-time-delay degradedvoltage protection system that will be installed during the Reload 8/Cycle9 refueling outage. This modification would provide a larger actuationtime delay under normal operating conditions. Although the existing degraded voltage protection system was designed towithstand short term voltage drops due to expected operating evolutions(such as the starting of a larger motor), the design of the system didnot consider the significant voltage transient associated with bus transfers.As a result, actuations of the protection system have occured during normalstartups when plant electrical loads are transferred from the off-sitepower source to the main generator source. The proposed modification would increase the time delay for emergency dieselgenerator (EDG) actuation from the existing 9 seconds to 45 seconds undernormal operating conditions. Under loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) conditions,the LOCA signal will independently start the EDGs. As a result of the proposed modification, TS Section 3.2 (Bases), and Tables3.2-2 and 4.2-2 would be revised. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>In accordance with the Commission's Regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, theCommission has made a determination that the proposed amendment involvesno significant hazards considerations. To make this determination the staffmust establish that operation in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated, or (2) create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated,or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) analysis for the design basis loss-of-coolant-accident(LOCA) considers a simultaneous loss of off-site power. The proposed changesdo not affect the circuitry which starts the EDGs under these conditions.The ability of the EDGs to supply power to the emergency busses in thetime assumed in the DBA LOCA accident analysis remains unchanged. A variationof this event is a LOCA with a simultaneous degraded off-site voltage condition.This specific sequence of events was not analyzed in the FSAR, but wasconsidered subsequently in an NRC safety evaluation report. The secondlevel of undervoltage protection system, installed during the Reload 7/Cycle8 refueling outage, connects the EDGs to the 4160 VAC emergency buses withinthe same time that is assumed in the DBA case. The proposed changes tothe Technical Specifications do not change the response of the plant underthese conditions. Therefore, operation of FitzPatrick in accordance withthe proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Failure of the modified degraded voltage system to operate would placethe plant in the same configuration that existed before the system wasinstalled. FitzPatrick was previously analyzed in that configuration andtherefore, the proposed modifications would not initiate or contributeto a new or different type of accident. Inadvertent actuation of the modifieddegraded voltage system would be identical to two actuations of the degradedvoltage protection system experienced during operating Cycle 8. The resultis similar to, but less severe than the loss of off-site power transientpreviously analyzed. It would be less severe since the non-safety relatedbuses would still be energized from the off-site power sources and wouldbe available to mitigate the transient. Therefore, operation of FitzPatrickin accordance with the proposed amendment will not create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.In addition to assuring that the undervoltage protection system satisfiesits design function, the proposed changes reduce the number of challengesto safety related equipment (the EDGs) and reduce the probability of atransient initiator. The proposed changes thus result in an increase inthe margin of safety for the FitzPatrick plant. Therefore, operation ofFitzPatrick in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involvea significant reduction in a margin of safety. Since the application for amendment involves proposed changes that areencompassed by the criteria for which no significant hazards considerationexists, the staff has made a proposed determination that the applicationinvolves no significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>State University of New York,Penfield Library, Reference and Documents Department, Oswego, New York13126. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Mr. Charles M.

The revision reflects a Boron-10 enrichmentof 55 atom percent in the sodium pentaborate solution used for the StandbyLiquid Control System (SLCS) at the Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant,which will enable the maintenance of a solution concentration as low as10.7% (as opposed to the minimum concentration of 13.7% required in 10CFR 50.62(c)(4), the ATWS Rule. This revision also deletes the requirementfor a mid-cycle surveillance of the sodium pentaborate solution due tothe availability and planned use of pre-mixed and vendor-certified solutions,which will preclude the need for the licensee to mix solution components(boric acid borax) on site thereby eliminating the need to continue torequire a mid-cycle surveillance.
