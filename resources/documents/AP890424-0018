Watkins told a meeting of oil executives last week. ``Timeis running out,'' he said, for action to avert a crisis.   Watkins has begun speaking out on the issue recently as he seeksto galvanize public support for key Bush administration energygoals: a revival of the commercial nuclear power industry, supportfor domestic oil drilling, complete decontrol of natural gas pricesand faster development of new energy technologies.   Although the country's reliance on imported oil has been growingsince 1985, the Energy Department under John Herrington boastedeven in the final months of the Reagan administration that U.S.energy security had been strengthened.   ``Our reliance on insecure sources of imported oil has beensharply reduced,'' Herrington wrote in an October 1988 report,adding that ``... the United States is better prepared than everbefore for an oil supply interruption.''   The Commerce Department, in a report published two months ago,said, ``Since 1979, U.S. energy security has been strengthened andthe United States is better prepared than before to deter as wellas respond to an energy supply emergency.''   A similar conclusion was drawn by the General Accounting Office,the investigative arm of Congress, in a broad assessment of oiltrends last August.   ``The United States and other major oil-importing countries areless vulnerable to an oil crisis today than they were a decadeago,'' the GAO report said.   Nearly all energy analysts, in and out of government, agree thatthe United States is fast approaching the day when it gets morethan half its oil from abroad. Most say this carries increasedrisk. But some dispute Watkins' assertion that the trend makes itmore likely the nation will face a supply crisis.   ``It is just as meaningless to claim that we are movinginevitably toward another oil supply crisis as it is to say itcan't happen again,'' John Lichtblau, executive director of thePetroleum Industry Research Foundation, told a House Energy andCommerce subcommittee last week.   ``The mere fact that our imports are rising does not per seincrease the probability of another foreign supply disruption,'' hesaid.   In the first three months of this year, oil imports averaged 44percent of total U.S. supplies. That is up from an average lastyear of 37 percent and the recent low point of 27 percent in 1985,before oil prices crashed, according to Energy Department figures.   In 1973, the year key Arab producers embargoed oil shipments tothe United States to protest U.S. support for Israel, U.S. importswere 35 percent of total supplies. In 1977, imports peaked at arecord 46.5 percent of supplies.   And while the share of U.S. oil supplies originating in Arabcountries also has been rising _ reaching 10.6 percent last year,according to the department _ it is less than the proportionsupplied by non-Arab producers. Non-Arab foreign oil accounted for26.4 percent of U.S. supplies last year, up from 24.3 percent in1985.   Analysts expect the import trend to continue as production fromU.S. wells declines.   Lichtblau said last month's massive Exxon oil spill in Alaskashowed there are risks to consider even in the domestic supplysystem. A brief interruption of shipments from the Trans-AlaskaPipeline System as a result of the spill helped trigger a temporarybut sharp jump in gasoline prices across the country.   Watkins, in a view shared by the oil industry, says overcomingenvironmental concerns about new oil development in Alaska is avital step toward reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil andlessening the risks of a supply crisis.   He has struck a similar note in the department's battle to stopNew York Gov. Mario Cuomo from carrying out a plan to scrap theShoreham nuclear power plant on Long Island. Federal regulatorslast Thursday approved a full-power license for the plant, butCuomo and the plant's owner have struck a deal under which it wouldbe dismantled before ever producing a single kilowatt of power forsale.   ``Shoreham reduces our potential vulnerability to insecureimports,'' Watkins said.   Lichtblau and others say the key link in the nation's defenseagainst an oil supply disruption is the Strategic PetroleumReserve, the government's underground stockpile of crude oil thatnow totals 566 billion barrels, equal to nearly three months ofimports. The government is continuing to add to the reserve.   Another factor working in the favor of oil-importing countriesis a trend toward less reliance by Middle East producers onshipments through the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow passage that Iranseveral times has threatened to close. Iraq and Saudi Arabia havebeen building overland pipelines to the Red Sea and theMediterranean in order to reduce their vulnerability to a cutoff ofPersian Gulf shipping.</TEXT></DOC>
