The subpoenaissued to Attorney General Richard Thornburgh by the HouseJudiciary Committee on July 25 asked for an unclassified 1989legal opinion by then-Assistant Attorney General WilliamBarr. This opinion, the gravamen of which was leaked to thepress by someone in the executive branch, states that the FBIcould go to any foreign country and arrest people without theconsent or knowledge of that country and whether or not therewas an extradition treaty.   This assertion of &quot;kidnap&quot; authority caused generalconcern, and the subcommittee I chair, which has jurisdictionover the FBI, held a public hearing, receiving testimony fromthe FBI and the Justice and State departments. State and FBIwitnesses testified the &quot;kidnap&quot; provision had broughtworried inquiries from other nations. Justice refused to giveus a copy of the opinion even though the FBI, the subject ofthe opinion, had no objection to our receiving it.</LP><TEXT>   Since then both Chairman Jack Brooks and I repeatedly haveasked the attorney general for the legal opinion. If the U.S.uses &quot;kidnap&quot; authority, then other countries such as Libya,Cuba or Iraq could unilaterally invoke a similar license.   Chairman Brooks intended to make his last request for thelegal opinion to Mr. Thornburgh at a public hearing July 18.The attorney general refused to show up at the hearing andhis staff again refused to produce the document, even thoughit's unclassified. Accordingly, the subpoena was issued. Theattorney general himself initiated action to forestallcontempt proceedings by offering to produce the document forperusal by committee members. So far, that hasn't happened.   Mr. Brooks did not &quot;blink.&quot; The subpoena remains in effectuntil the attorney general complies or the committeedissolves it. Unless an arrangement for receipt of thedocument is made before Congress returns, I expect contemptproceedings will be pursued.   Rep. Don Edwards (D., Calif.)   Chairman   Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights   Washington</TEXT></DOC>
