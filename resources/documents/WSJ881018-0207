Four money market funds' total returns for September were misstated and as a result shouldn't have been included among the bottom 10 performers for the month. Bison Money Market Fund &quot;B&quot; had a total return of 0.63%; Navigator Money Fund had a total return of 0.66%; St. Clair Money Fund had a total return of 0.65%, and USAA Mutual Money Market Fund had a total return of 0.63%. The Sit New Beginnings Tax-Free Fund shouldn't have been ranked among the bottom 10 performers among general municipal bond funds in September because the fund's investment category was changed recently. </TEXT></DOC>
