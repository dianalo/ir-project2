Pakistan has emerged as the latest intermediary in communications between the two nations about U.S. hostages. Iran may be sending a signal that it would like to work through the Pakistanis.    Sahabzada Yaqub Khan, Pakistan's foreign minister, met with Vice President Dan Quayle and other U.S. officials in Washington last week, and one administration official said the fate of hostages was &quot;prominently discussed.&quot; Mr. Quayle urged Pakistan to help win the release of eight Americans held in Lebanon.    The Pakistani official is planning a trip to Tehran next week. U.S. and Pakistani officials say the U.S. didn't specifically ask Mr. Yaqub Khan to undertake a mission to Iran, which he has visited before to discuss regional issues, including the war in Afghanistan.    But Iran yesterday seemed to signal an interest in working through Pakistan to talk about the hostages. The Tehran Times newspaper said Iran would soon begin &quot;indirect talks&quot; with the U.S. over the hostage situation, and quoted &quot;political observers&quot; as saying that Pakistan's foreign minister was the intermediary with the best chance of success in such discussions.    For their part, White House officials tried to signal their openness to communicating through Pakistan. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that &quot;we would take advantage of every visit like that to send a message in.&quot;    The U.S. doesn't have formal diplomatic relations with Iran. But Pakistan, while a strong friend of the U.S., has maintained good relations with its fellow Moslem nation. Iran, in turn, exerts strong influence over the Shiite extremists in Lebanon who are holding Western hostages.    White House officials say the U.S. has sent other diplomatic messages to Iran this week. The U.S. normally transmits formal diplomatic notes through the Swiss government, which represents American interests in Tehran.    Algeria is believed to be communicating with the Iranians on behalf of the Bush administration as well. And it is understood that the U.S. has asked other nations, including Turkey, to use any influence they might have to try to help in the hostage situation. According to diplomatic officials, Turkey has been in contact with Iran on its own, telling Iranians that if they are interested in an opening to the West, now is the time to use their influence to resolve the hostage crisis.    In addition, a senior administration official said President Bush is using a variety of personal contacts to send messages outside usual diplomatic channels.    Margaret Tutwiler, the State Department's spokeswoman, yesterday reiterated administration statements that the U.S. is prepared to begin talking directly with authorized representatives from Tehran. However, she added that improved relations &quot;depend upon that government stopping its support for terrorism and taking action to bring about the immediate, unconditional and safe&quot; release of U.S. hostages being held in Lebanon. And Mr. Fitzwater, while also expressing willingness for direct talks, said it is &quot;premature&quot; to consider holding them now.    The Iranian newspaper report about contacts through Pakistan was relayed on Iran's government-operated IRNA news agency, suggesting that the report was sanctioned by the government in Tehran. The Iranian newspaper has been known to have good contacts with the office of Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani.    Still, some observers speculated that Iran's use of public communications like newspaper stories suggests that diplomatic communications between the U.S. and Iran haven't yet become detailed and serious. &quot;I wonder why, if Rafsanjani has something concrete going, he would need all this public diplomacy,&quot; said Shaul Bakhash, an Iranian writer and analyst at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. </TEXT></DOC>
