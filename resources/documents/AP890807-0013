Despite laws limiting the release of such data, ``sensitivecountries ... have obtained information dealing with detonators,explosives and firing sets that could assist or enhance nuclearweapons development,'' said the report by the General AccountingOffice, Congress' investigative arm.   ``Sensitive'' countries were defined as communist-ruled or thosesuspected of clandestine nuclear weapons programs. Of these, Iraq,Israel, Pakistan, India, Argentina, South Africa, South Korea,Taiwan, Bulgaria and China were named as buying sensitivenuclear-related data from the U.S. Energy Department throughroutine orders or subscriptions, along with nine other countriesincluding major allies.   ``Many experts believe that the United States indirectlyassisted India through the liberal publication of unclassified(fuel) reprocessing information,'' to stage its ``explosion of apeaceful nuclear device in 1974,'' the report noted.   The GAO cited no concrete example of U.S. information enabling acountry to make atomic bombs, but it said it has found that``weaknesses exist ... that raise questions about the Department ofEnergy's ability to effectively protect national security and meetthis country's nonproliferation policies.''   The study was sent to Congress in June and, under GAOregulations, made public 30 days later.   The GAO and Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, who requested the report,said the problem centers on the flow of information consideredsensitive but not formally classified as secret or restricted.   ``The Department of Energy must stop dragging its feet onissuing guidance to its (atomic) weapons laboratories onidentifying and limiting dissemination of unclassified, controllednuclear information,'' Glenn said in a statement.   He said his governmental affairs committee plans hearings laterthis year on the issue as well as other ``serious securityweaknesses at the DOE weapons labs.''   The GAO study said the Energy Department's failure to issueguidelines on unclassified material is ``resulting in the releaseof sensitive information to proliferation-risk countries useful forthe design, manufacture or use of nuclear weapons,'' Glenn said.   Energy Department spokeswoman Janie Shaheen said the departmentreceived the report July 27 and planned no comment during the 60days allowed for reviewing it.   The DOE faces a dilemma, the GAO said, because under differentlaws it is expected both to control and disseminate non-classifiednuclear information.   The 1978 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act and other laws requireinformation controls, but ``various technology transfer legislationrequires DOE and the weapons laboratories to collaborate with theprivate sector to disseminate unclassified research results,'' theGAO said.   ``Further, the Freedom of Information Act requires DOE to makemost unclassified information available to anyone _ domestic orforeign _ who requests it,'' it added.   DOE weapons laboratories produced 39,000 research reports in1986-87 of which more than 60 percent were available by sale orsubscription, the GAO said.   It found that 68 percent of 30 nuclear-related studies it tracedwent to overseas recipients _ and that Iraq, Israel and Pakistanrequested six copies each while the largest total number of copies,71, went to China.   One of the reports sold abroad discussed methods to improve adetonator used in most U.S. nuclear bombs; another describedmethods to shape the explosives in such weapons, the GAO said.   DOE scientists also respond directly to ``dear colleague''requests for published information from foreign nationals,including those from ``sensitive countries,'' the GAO said. ``Whenthe request is `routine,' DOE allows the laboratories to send theinformation without prior approval,'' even though routine requestsare not officially defined.   ``Several examples demonstrate ... confusion,'' the GAO said,describing disagreements among scientists whether specific reportsmerely summarized well-known techniques or provided new materialspecifically useful for developing atomic weapons.</TEXT></DOC>
