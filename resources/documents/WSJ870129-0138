The tentative settlement may have come none too soon for the ailing farm-equipment maker. While the strike has substantially reduced Deere's bloated inventories, it may already have cut into the company's market share in industrial equipment, some analysts said. The company, however, said it has maintained its market share throughout the strike.    Also, if the walkout were to go on much longer, it could seriously impair Deere's ability to get spare parts and planting implements to dealers in time for the spring planting season.    Because the strike has dragged on as long as it has, making it the longest in the company's history, it has left many UAW members embittered toward Deere, damaging what have traditionally been good relations between the company and its workers.    Neither the company nor the union would comment on the details of the tentative settlement, though a union source said it includes a wage freeze. The divisive issues in the dispute have involved pensions, job-security provisions and cost-of-living increases. Union members are expected to vote on the tentative agreement this weekend. If the pact is ratified, Deere said it could reopen its 13 plants as soon as Monday. But not all of the 12,300 union workers would immediately return to work, a company spokesman said.    The proposed contract would be in effect only 18 months, half the length of previous Deere contracts, because tradition calls for an accord to expire at the same time as Caterpillar Inc.'s agreement with the UAW.    The UAW began the strike at three of Deere's facilities in August. The company subsequently closed its remaining 10 union-represented plants, a move the union termed a lockout. Traditionally, the company and the union follow the contract set at Caterpillar. But Caterpillar's agreement, which was reached in July, couldn't be applied easily to Deere, particularly as the Peoria, Ill.-based construction equipment maker is in a stronger market than Deere, which primarily makes farm machinery.    Deere apparently was eager for a settlement of the lengthy walkout. Negotiations with the union had broken down three times, and the company had begun using salaried personnel to operate some of its facilities. Deere recently hired William J. Usery, a private mediator and former U.S. secretary of labor, to help mediate the dispute.    Some Deere dealers said they were beginning to feel the effects of the prolonged walkout. At Reynolds Farm Equipment Inc. in Fishers, Ind., customers had to wait as long as three weeks to have equipment repaired because of the delay in getting spare parts.    &quot;That's real good news,&quot; Jack Koenig, a manager at Koenig Equipment Inc., said of the tentative agreement. Mr. Koenig said the Anna, Ohio-based dealership was beginning to run short of some farm-equipment products.    Some analysts said that if the strike were to go on much longer, it could have serious financial repercussions for Deere. The company had a record quarterly loss of $139.7 million in its fourth period ended Oct. 31 in large part because of the strike, and analysts expect the company to post a loss for its first quarter. About now, Deere usually boosts production and shipping of spare parts and planting implements for the critical spring planting season.    Some analysts also said the strike has cut into Deere's market share in industrial equipment, which accounted for about 23% of the company's fiscal 1985 sales. Frank Manfredi, the publisher of an industry newsletter, estimates that Deere may have lost as much as 4% market share in the small and medium construction-equipment market. He said the company's market share before the strike was about 18% to 19%.    The Deere spokesman, however, said the company's market share in construction equipment has &quot;held up fairly well.&quot; He added, though, that there has been some slippage in isolated products. The company expects to regain those losses in the months ahead, he said.    Though union leaders expect ratification of the agreement, they said the bitterness from the strike will linger for a long while. This prolonged walkout wasn't typical for Deere, which hadn't had a strike since 1979, and then for only 20 days. &quot;The company may have some problems in getting cooperation out of the members,&quot; Ray Sprouse, a UAW official, said. But he and other union officials added that the members are looking forward to returning to work.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Deere closed at $26.50 a share, up 87.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
