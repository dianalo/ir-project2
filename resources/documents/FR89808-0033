Introduction</ITAG>FDA is soliciting public comment on a wide range of food labeling issuesto help the agency determine what changes in food labeling requirements,if any, should be proposed by this Administration. Although the food labelhas been the subject of considerable study and revision over the past 20years, FDA believes it appropriate now to consider significant new improvementsin food labeling.Several factors underscore this belief. First, the recent ``The SurgeonGeneral's Report on Nutrition and Health'' and the National Academy ofSciences' report entitled ``Diet and Health: Implications for ReducingChronic Disease Risk'' provide authoritative current views on the evidencelinking dietary patterns and health. Second, surveys demonstrate that consumersthemselves want to play a more active role in self-care (see ``Trends 1989:Consumer Attitudes in the Supermarket'' by the Food Marketing Institute,Washington, DC) and that, specifically, they seek more useful and easilyunderstood information about the nutritional characteristics of the foodsthey eat (see FDA's analysis of the 1988 Health and Diet Survey). Third,recognizing this interest by consumers, both consumer and industry groupshave been striving to design what they consider to be more informativefood labels; food manufacturers have also expressed increasing interestin using food labels to convey the relationship between diet and certaindiseases. Finally, numerous bills have recently been introduced in Congressand in State legislatures that would amend the current food labeling requirements(e.g., mandatory nutrition labeling, cholesterol content, label identificationof vegetable oils, and sodium and potassium content).Accordingly, FDA solicits public comment on the ways to most effectivelyuse the food label to promote sound nutrition for the Nation's consumers.In addition to specific questions listed throughout this notice, FDA requestscomments on the following general questions:1. Are the public health benefits likely to be derived from revised foodlabeling sufficient to warrant the economic costs associated with suchrevisions?2. What should be the agency's priorities in deciding which changes tomake in the food label, i.e., which changes are most important and whichare least important?3. What changes in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) shouldFDA seek to help the agency bring about reforms in food labeling; in theabsence of legislative change, what should be FDA's priorities for changesin its regulations and policies?4. What should be FDA's policy for permitting or restricting the use offood labels that link a food to prevention or treatment of disease?5. Should FDA seek to expand nutrition labeling, particularly by makingit mandatory for most packaged foods?6. What areas need further research and evaluation before decisions canbe reached on whether and how changes can be made?7. What modifications can be made in the food label to help both ordinaryconsumers and the under-educated better understand and benefit from theinformation on the label?8. How best can FDA harmonize its food labeling regulations with thoseof other nations, particularly the European Community and Canada? Withother Federal agencies, such as the Department of Agriculture?9. Are there any topics in this notice that would represent such a significantcommitment of agency time and resources that consideration of them shouldbe deferred?10. Since food labeling concerns change over time, what mechanism mightbe used in the future to assure that evolving concerns are addressed andthat food labeling requirements reflect current scientific knowledge andconsumer information needs?To maximize the public's responsiveness to these questions, FDA plans tohold public hearings in different areas of the country. The time and placeof these hearings will be announced in future issues of the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> FDA plans to utilize both the written and oralcomments to propose specific changes to the current food labeling requirements.Also, the National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine has beencommissioned by the Public Health Service and the Department of Agriculture'sFood Safety and Inspection Service to review food labeling policy as administeredby FDA and the Department of Agriculture and suggest options for improvingFederal food labeling policy. That study will also complement this noticeand the planned hearings by suggesting options for making improvementsin Federal food labeling policy. Information gathered from written andoral comments will be shared with the Institute of Medicine for use inpreparation of its report and recommendations.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Recent Food Labeling History</ITAG>This current food labeling initiative must be viewed within the contextof the food labeling developments of the past 20 years, beginning withthe White House Conference on Food, Nutrition, and Health (the Conference)that took place in 1969. Following the Conference's recommendations, FDAimplemented significant initiatives dealing with nutrition labeling, ingredientlabeling, common or usual name labeling, imitation/substitute food labeling,fortification policy, and safe and suitable ingredient policy.In 1973, FDA published final rules on nutrition labeling that permitted,and in some cases required, foods to be labeled for their nutritional value.In 1978, FDA, along with the Department of Agriculture and the FederalTrade Commission, conducted a basic reassessment of food labeling policy,out of concern that food labeling regulations had become overly complexand, in some cases, inconsistent. The three agencies held five public hearingsacross the nation, gathering public views on ingredient labeling, imitation/substitutefoods, food fortification, the nutrition label, and other labeling issues.Over 450 persons appeared at the hearings and more than 9,000 written commentswere received. The comments focused mostly on ingredient, nutrition, andopen date labeling. This process resulted in a December 1979, notice announcingtentative agency positions. At that time, FDA also conducted a nationwideconsumer survey on food labeling, the results of which were published inOctober 1979.In 1981, however, as a result of concerns expressed to the PresidentialTask Force on Regulatory Relief, FDA deferred consideration of a broadfood labeling initiative, and proceeded instead on a regulation-by-regulationbasis. The first such proposal was published the next year, 1982, whenFDA proposed that sodium content be included as a mandatory part of nutritionlabeling. That proposal also defined terms for describing the sodium contentof foods, such as ``low sodium,'' ``reduced sodium,'' and ``sodium free.''The need for this kind of sodium labeling was triggered by the associationbetween sodium consumption and hypertension. A final sodium regulationbecame effective in July 1986.In 1986, FDA published a similar proposal regarding cholesterol and fattyacid labeling, based on the relationship between blood cholesterol levelsand heart disease. That proposal would establish definitions for the descriptiveterms ``cholesterol free,'' ``low cholesterol,'' and ``reduced cholesterol,''and would require the inclusion of cholesterol and fatty acid content innutrition labeling whenever a claim was made for either food component.A final rule based on the proposal is now in the final stages of development.Lastly, in 1987, FDA published a proposal that would permit appropriatehealth messages on food labels. Given advances in knowledge about the relationshipsbetween diet and health, the agency has proposed that health-related messages,when appropriately formulated for use on food labels, could provide valuableinformation to health-conscious consumers. For reasons described furtherbelow, a final rule based on that proposal has not yet been promulgated.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Summary of Issues</ITAG>The food label has developed so that it has several possible components,all of which are intended to convey accurate, useful information to consumers.The remainder of this notice solicits comments in the following five areas:1. <T3>Nutrition Labeling</T3>_Nutrition labeling includes the list of a food'snutritional value_calories, protein, carbohydrate, fat, sodium, vitamins,and minerals. Because the basic nutrition labeling regulations were developedalmost 20 years ago, FDA believes this may be an appropriate time to reviewthe regulations to determine if certain required elements could be madevoluntary (e.g., some vitamins) or if elements that are currently voluntaryshould be made mandatory (e.g., saturated fats) to ensure uniformity. Moreover,because nutrition labeling is voluntary for most foods, FDA is seekingcomment on whether nutrition labeling should be mandatory for more foodsand how this could best be accomplished.2. <T3>Nutrition Label Format</T3>_FDA has long recognized that the currentnutrition label might not be in the optimal format for conveying useableinformation to consumers. Industry and consumer groups have also arguedthat the information on the label should be in an easier-to-understandformat so that consumers can readily identify foods suitable for theirindividual diets. FDA is seeking comment on how the current label formatmight be improved.3. <T3>Ingredient Labeling</T3>_FDA seeks comment on whether the current ingredientlabeling requirements that are not mandated by the act should be amendedand whether legislative changes should be sought for mandated requirements(e.g., for more detailed ingredient information). The agency is also seekingcomments on whether and how the format for ingredient labeling should berevised.4. <T3>Descriptions of Food</T3>_There are a number of ways in which the foodlabel is used to describe foods_names established by standards of identity,common or usual names, imitation or substitute foods, and descriptor labelingsuch as ``low calorie.'' FDA has several regulations in each of these areasand standards are specifically provided for by law. Among the issues theagency is seeking comment on are: (1) The usefulness of food standardsin assuring consumers that commonly purchased foods meet certain standardsof identity and composition, and whether revisions should be made in specificstandards themselves or in the procedures by which standards are adoptedor amended; and (2) whether FDA should define, in a manner analogous tocurrent regulatory definitions for ``low sodium,'' other labeling suchas ``low fat'' and ``lite'' that are being used by manufacturers.5. <T3>Health Messages</T3>_There has been increasing use of food labels toimpart health messages to consumers about such things as the relationshipbetween high fiber foods and colon cancer risks, low cholesterol foodsand heart disease, and high calcium foods' impact on osteoporosis. FDAhas traditionally determined that foods may not make such ``medical'' claims;in recent years, however, scientific evidence has accumulated that maysupport certain claims. The agency is seeking public comment on how suchmessages can be properly conveyed to consumers.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Major Issues Under Consideration</ITAG>The specific issues and questions on which FDA is seeking public commentare discussed in the remainder of this notice.A. Nutrition LabelingWhen a food processor makes a claim about nutritional value of a food inlabeling or advertising, or when a nutrient such as a vitamin is addedto the food, nutrition labeling must be provided (21 CFR 101.9). Nutritionlabeling may also be voluntarily provided. Whenever nutrition labelingis provided, the following must be included:1. Serving size;2. Number of servings;3. Caloric content;4. Protein, carbohydrate, and fat content in grams;5. Sodium in milligrams; and6. Protein, vitamins A and C, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, calcium, andiron expressed as a percentage of the U.S. Recommended Daily Allowance(RDA).Additionally, fatty acid composition (saturated and polyunsaturated) andcholesterol content may be voluntarily disclosed as part of the informationon fat, and vitamins D, E, B<T2>6</T2>, and B<T2>12</T2> as well as folic acid, biotin, pantothenic acid, phosphorus,iodine, magnesium, zinc, potassium, and copper may be voluntarily disclosed.If a label claim is made about any of the latter nutrients, or if any areadded, they must be included in nutrition labeling. All nutrient valuesare expressed on a per serving basis.FDA seeks public comment on whether the current nutrition label requirementsshould be changed. The questions to be addressed include:<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Should nutrition labeling be voluntary or mandatory?</ITAG>Currently, about 60 percent of FDA-regulated packaged foods bear nutritionlabeling. However, many consumer advocacy groups, health professionals,and nutrition educators would like to see nutrition labeling on all foods.The agency believes that, although the act could be interpreted to permitFDA to require nutrition labeling on all foods, legislation explicitlymandating nutrition labeling would probably be most desirable. Thus, responsesto the following questions are solicited:a. Should the current system of nutrition labeling be retained (i.e., mandatorywhen a claim is made or when nutrients are added, otherwise voluntary),should it be made completely voluntary, or should FDA seek legislationthat would make nutrition labeling mandatory? Alternatively, is the regulatoryroute for mandatory labeling preferable?b. If the current system of nutrition labeling is retained, should theconditions that trigger mandatory nutrition labeling (i.e., added nutrientsor nutritional claims) be revised?<ITAG tagnum="81">2. What foods should be exempt from nutrition labeling?</ITAG>If nutrition labeling were to become mandatory, FDA might wish to continueexemptions for certain foods. Thus, should FDA exempt, or require nutritionlabeling for:a. Foods that make insignificant nutritional contributions? (i.e., spices,coffee, tea, sugar, salt, condiments, etc.)b. Fresh fruits and vegetables?<ITAG tagnum="81">3. What nutrients should be declared in nutrition labeling?</ITAG>When the list of nutrients required on nutrition labels was establishedin 1973, public health concerns generally had focused on nutrient deficienciesrather than, as is now the case, on the potentially adverse effects ofover-consumption of certain food components. Also, at that time, analyticalmethodologies and RDAs were unavailable for many nutrients. Thus, thereis considerable interest in reviewing the list of required nutrients toensure that nutrition labeling provides the most salient, yet appropriatelybalanced, information from a public health perspective. Questions on whichFDA seeks comments are:a. <T3>Are there currently required nutrients that could become optional elements?</T3>Are there any nutrients that are currently required to be listed in nutritionlabeling that have become of less public health significance (e.g., thiamine,riboflavin), and for which the listing should be made optional? If nutrientsare to be identified as optional elements, what criteria should be usedfor determining which nutrients listings are optional?b. <T3>Are there currently optional nutrients that should be made requiredelements</T3>? Has the public health significance of any nutrients thatare currently permitted to be listed in nutrition labeling as optionalelements changed to such a degree that they should now be made mandatory(e.g., fiber, fat, cholesterol)? What are the criteria upon which suchdecisions should be based?c. <T3>Are there other nutrients or food components that should now be madeeither optional or required?</T3> Are there any additional nutrients orfood components that should be considered for listing in nutrition labeling?What criteria should be used to make these determinations?d. <T3>Should fat labeling be revised?</T3> Given that ``The Surgeon General'sReport on Nutrition and Health'' and the National Academy of Sciences'report entitled ``Diet and Health: Implications for Reducing Chronic DiseaseRisk'' both focused on the level of fat consumption by Americans as theprimary diet-related health issue, how should fat labeling of food withinthe context of the nutrition label be handled? Are there certain foodsfor which fat content labeling should be required? Should a detailed, quantitativelisting of fatty acids (e.g., saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated)be required? If so, what are the definitions and suitable methodologiesfor the appropriate fatty acids to be listed? What should be the labelingstatus of other components of fat (e.g., <T3>omega</T3>-3 and <T3>omega</T3>-6 fatty acids, <T3>trans</T3>-fatty acids, cholesterol)? Should the ``and/or'' policyfor oil labeling be changed to focus only on the content of saturated andunsaturated oils, rather than naming the specific oils (see Section IIIC_Ingredient Labeling)?e. <T3>Should fiber be included in the nutrition label?</T3> Although nota traditional ``nutrient,'' the fiber content of food is receiving increasedattention. How should the labeling of fiber be treated within the contextof nutrition labeling? Is it appropriate to label separate components offiber? What are the definitions and methodologies to be used for fiberlabeling?f. <T3>Should carbohydrate labeling be revised?</T3> How should the listingof components of carbohydrate be treated within the context of nutritionlabeling (e.g., complex starches, total sugars)?g. <T3>Is it necessary for all foods to have the same nutrition labeling oris it possible to design nutritional labeling requirements that vary dependingon the class or type of food?</T3> Is an approach feasible that has certainrequired elements for all foods with additional elements that are requireddepending on factors such as food type, fortification, or claims? Whatare the decision criteria in designing such a system?<ITAG tagnum="81">4. What criteria should be used in determining serving size?</ITAG>There is continuing debate on how serving sizes, which are currently leftto the manufacturer, are derived. In 1974, FDA attempted to impose servingsizes on several commodities but because of resources and complexity wasnever able to complete rulemaking. Now that consumers are more interestedin nutrients associated with chronic diseases (e.g., fat, sodium), a fewmanufacturers are selecting smaller and smaller serving sizes. These changesbecome a problem if manufacturers claim multiple servings in obvious single-servingcontainers or fractional servings per container and when similar productshave inconsistent serving sizes. Thus, FDA seeks comment on whether servingsizes should be determined by FDA (by regulation) or by manufacturers (followingcriteria established by FDA) or not included.B. Nutrition Labeling FormatSection 403(f) of the Act requires that food information be conspicuouslydisplayed and be presented in terms that the ordinary consumer is likelyto read and understand under ordinary conditions of purchase and use. Thedetails of features such as type size and location of information are containedin FDA's regulations (21 CFR Part 101).FDA regulations specify that nutrition information is to appear in a formatthat consists of ``columns of figures.'' In the years since those regulationswere promulgated, numerous suggestions have been made for presenting thelarge quantity of information, mandatory and voluntary, that appears onpackaged food labels. Nevertheless, after many years of experience withlabel formats in the marketplace, no consensus has emerged regarding thebest ones to use. Food labeling surveys contracted by FDA in 1978 and 1982revealed that many consumers believe the present system is too inflexible,complex, and difficult for the average consumer to understand.Various alternative formats have been suggested to improve the usefulnessof the food label. Consumers are increasingly reading food labels as theystrive to improve their eating habits in accordance with guidelines setforth in such recent scientific reports as ``The Surgeon General's Reporton Nutrition and Health'' and the National Academy of Sciences' reportentitled ``Diet and Health: Implications for Reducing Chronic Disease Risk.''A more ``user-friendly,'' format that is easier to read and understandwill be crucial for improving the communication of diet-related informationto consumers.<T3>What is the best format for the nutrition label?</T3> FDA welcomescomments that address the types of label formats that could be used toconvey to consumers the diverse technical information required. Formatchanges should result in simplification, clarity, flexibility, and standardization.Specifically, comments on or responses to the following questions are solicited:1. Can nutrition labels be made more helpful? Are they easy to read?2. Are there terms on the nutrition label that are not readily understandable?For example, is the current use of metric measurements (i.e., grams andmilligrams) acceptable? What are the alternatives?3. If the nutrition label were to be revised, should it maintain the numericalapproach currently required? Would graphics such as pie graphs or bar chartsbe preferable, or would the use of some adjectival scale (e.g., fair, good,excellent) be preferable? Would a combination of numbers and illustrationsor adjectives be useful?4. Should the organization of the nutrition label be changed? For example,should the order in which nutrients are listed be changed? Should any ofthe nutrition label elements be highlighted or emphasized? If so, whichones and how?5. Small packages and cans create a problem for manufacturers who are confrontedwith space limitations. What can or should FDA do to accommodate thosesituations?6. It has become routine procedure in the food industry to consumer-testpossible changes in marketing variables such as package design and labeladvertising. Should FDA and/or industry conduct such research before makingany changes in the food label format?C. Ingredient LabelingMost packaged foods containing two or more ingredients must list thoseingredients in descending order of predominance by weight (21 CFR 101.4).However, there are a few exceptions. Foods that are the subject of a foodstandard are exempt from declaring the mandatory ingredients, althoughoptional ingredients must be labeled.For fats and oils, each individual fat or oil ingredient of a food mustbe declared by its specific common or usual name in order of predominancein the food, except when the total fat and oil component of the food doesnot exceed the weight of the most predominant ingredient in the food. Inthis case, manufacturers are permitted to list fats or oils in combinationirrespective of whether they are actually used in the product. Statementssuch as ``contains one or more of the following'' are followed by a listingof fats or oils that may be used in the product. The purpose of this ``and/or''rule is to allow manufacturers to take advantage of shifting prices forthe various fats and oils without a requirement to revise the label eachtime the fat or oil ingredient is changed.Specific questions FDA wishes addressed include:1. Should the existing order of predominance labeling be bolstered by arequirement that major ingredients be listed by percentage?2. Should the agency's current ``and/or'' labeling regulations be modified?a. Should ``and/or'' labeling be extended to permit such a labeling exemptionfor nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners?b. Should ``and/or'' labeling for fats and oils be continued as currentlypermitted, or, should FDA:i. Revoke the exemption?ii. Modify the exemption so that it would apply only where the total fatand oil content constitutes a minor portion of the food product?iii. Permit continued use of ``and/or'' labeling where the fats and oilsare of like nutritional value (e.g., ``and/or'' for similar polyunsaturatedvegetable oils)?3. Should ingredient labeling be expanded?a. Should legislation be sought to require the labeling of specific spices,colors, and flavors?b. Should there be ingredient labeling for ``fast'' food? If so, how couldthis be accomplished?c. Should FDA act, either administratively or by seeking legislation, torequire ingredient labeling on all food?4. How could the ingredient labeling format be revised to be more informativeto consumers (e.g., through the use of graphics, such as bar charts)?D. Description of FoodDescribing a food in a way that accurately represents the food's characteristicsand that does not deceive the consumer would seem to be a fairly straightforwardtask. However, how to do this has become quite controversial in recentyears and also may be an appropriate focus for reform.Nutritional labeling and ingredient labeling, which have both been discussedalready, are two ways to describe a food. This section will discuss twoother ways_naming a food and labeling statements about its characteristics.1. Should the current methods of naming foods be changed? Congress' originalapproach to how foods should be named was to provide for standards of identityfor foods in the act. The idea behind the standards concept was that thereare certain traditional foods that everyone knows, such as bread, milk,and cheese, and that when consumers buy these foods, they should get thefoods that they are expecting. Initially Congress authorized FDA to adoptstandards of identity that define the composition of these foods and thatthereby may prevent the debasement of these foods with new and cheaperingredients. While Congress recognized that there may be some foods thatwould not be subject to standards, it specifically stated that if a foodresembled a standardized food but did not comply with the standard, thatfood must be labeled as an ``imitation.''Standards must be established and amended in accordance with the proceduresset out in section 701(e) of the act. There must be a notice of a proposedstandard and then a final rule. After the final rule is published, a personwho objects to the final rule may be entitled to a formal evidentiary hearing.Moreover, the filing of an objection automatically stays the effect ofthe final rule until the Commissioner issues a final decision. Consequently,it is very difficult to adopt a standard or to amend one once it has beenadopted. For example, it took almost a decade to adopt the peanut butterstandard.As a result, it has been almost impossible to keep the food standards up-to-datewith advances in food technology and in nutrition. For example, fat, whichwas considered to be a valuable component of food at the time that thecheese standards were adopted, is now viewed by many as something to bereduced in the diet. However, the cheese standards are based largely onthe fat content of the food. Thus, to be called ``cheddar cheese,'' a productstill must contain a minimum of 50 percent milkfat, even though a reducedfat product would be more desirable to some (although the resulting productwould not be the traditional ``cheddar cheese''). Moreover, cheese meetingthe standard is not required to declare its fat content.The whole standards of identity approach may pose an additional problemfor new food products with respect to market entry. Due to the tight recipespecifications and the inflexibility of the standards system, new productsmay be at a disadvantage when they enter the market because they can notbe called something that is easily recognized or desired by consumers.For instance, low fat cheeses have to be named with something other thanthe standardized term. Consumers may be less willing to try such products.To allow manufacturers to take advantage of advances in food technology,and thus to give them relief from the dilemma of either complying withan outdated standard or having to label their food as an ``imitation,''FDA sought to narrow the scope of food standards. The agency did so byadopting the so-called ``imitation policy.'' By regulation, 21 CFR 101.3(e),FDA said that a food that resembles another food need not be labeled asan imitation if it is not nutritionally inferior to the food that it resembles,and if it bears a descriptive name that distinguishes from the standardizedfood.In addition, to minimize the need for new standards, FDA has adopted, in21 CFR Part 102, regulations that establish common or usual names for particulartypes of food. The common or usual names for particular types of food.The common or usual name that the agency adopts is a term that describesthe basic nature or the characteristics of the type of food. For example,the common or usual name of shrimp in cocktail sauce is ``shrimp cocktail,contains <T2>XXX</T2>% shrimp.'' However, the common or usual name regulations areadopted and amended by notice and comment rulemaking, rather than by theformal rulemaking procedures of section 701(e) of the act, which must befollowed for food standards. The controversy with respect to the labelingof dilute fruit juices demonstrates that a common or usual name that declaresthe percentage of juice in a beverage may still not adequately describethe product.The agency is aware that some people strongly favor the current systemof food standards. This support has been evidenced by State legislationthat has sought to limit applicability of FDA's imitation policy. (See,e.g., <T3>GMA </T3>v. <T3>Gerace, </T3>755 F.2d 993 (2d Cir.), <T3>aff'd without opinion,</T3> 474 U.S. 801, <T3>cert. denied</T3>, 474 U.S. 820 (1985).)Given this situation, FDA seeks comments and suggestions on the currentmethods of naming foods. The agency requests comments on whether, and towhat extent, food standards have continuing value in the 1990's. Shouldefforts be made to eliminate food standards and to replace them with asystem under which foods are given common or usual names like those prescribedunder 21 CFR 102.5?The agency seeks comments on whether the problems with food standards canbe addressed by administrative action or whether this matter should beincluded on the agency's legislative agenda. The agency also seeks commentson the possible approaches to standards that could be taken in legislation.One alternative to elimination would be to amend section 701(e)(1) of theact to delete the requirements for a formal evidentiary hearing for foodstandards. This change would subject food standards to notice and commentrulemaking and thus assure that the standards are more readily amendable.The agency solicits any other comments that bear on how food is named.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Should any changes be made in how FDA prescribes use of descriptors?</ITAG>Because of the growing public interest in eating healthy foods, manufacturersbegan to place statements on their labels that described their productsin ways such as ``fresh,'' ``natural,'' ``low in salt,'' ``reduced fat,''and ``no cholesterol.'' FDA found, however, that these descriptions werenot always in honest or consistent ways. For example, foods with variouslevels of sodium were all being described as ``low sodium.''To bring some order to the marketplace and to ensure that consumers arenot misled, FDA is developing a series of descriptors for use on the labelsof foods. These regulations define such terms as ``no,'' ``low,'' and ``reduced''for use in conjunction with a particular food component. For example, FDAhas said that a food can be described as low in sodium if it contains 140milligrams or less of sodium per serving (21 CFR 101.13(a)(3)). To date,FDA has adopted regulations that prescribe descriptors on calorie content(21 CFR 105.66) and sodium content (21 CFR 101.13). It has also proposeda set of cholesterol content descriptors (51 FR 42584; November 25, 1986).FDA has approached descriptors on a food-component-by-food-component basis,selecting reduction values that are nutritionally significant. Thus, ithas considered, for example, what level of sodium reduction is nutritionallysignificant, and what level of calorie reduction is significant. As a result,FDA regulations permit a reduced sodium claim to be made on the basis ofa 75 percent reduction (21 CFR 101.13(a)(4)), while they permit a reducedcalorie claim on the basis of a one-third reduction (21 CFR 105.66(d)(1)).Two specific questions the agency is seeking comment on are:a. How should descriptors be defined?FDA is aware that some believe that descriptors would be more understandableto consumers if they were consistent across categories of food components.Thus, for example, these people believe that a ``reduced'' claim shouldbe permitted whenever there is a one-third reduction in a food component,without regard to whether that reduction is nutritionally significant.FDA's view has been that to permit a ``reduced'' claim in such circumstanceswould be misleading. FDA solicits comments on which approach to definingdescriptors is the more appropriate one.b. What other descriptors are necessary?FDA is aware of public interest in descriptors for fat content, for fibercontent, and in regulatory definitions for such terms as ``lite,'' ``fresh,''and ``natural.'' FDA solicits comments on the need for regulations definingthese types of descriptors and on the priority that the agency should giveto addressing these descriptors.For example, FDA is aware that the Federal Trade Commission tried to developstandards for the use of the term ``natural'' and was unable to do so.Is an FDA regulation on ``natural'' needed?FDA's traditional position is that the use of the term ``fresh'' on a foodthat has been processed in any way (``fresh pasteurized orange juice'')is misleading. Is a regulation on the use of the term ``fresh'' necessary?FDA also seeks comment on whether there are any other matters involvingfood descriptors that should be addressed or considered by the agency.E. Health MessagesFDA has traditionally considered disease-related claims on food labelingto be drug claims that misbrand the food and subject it to the new drugprovisions of the act. However, during the past few years, food manufacturershave expressed their desire to utilize food labeling as a mechanism forproviding consumers with information about the relationship between dietand health, particularly in the context of contributing to disease prevention.In addition, consumers have become increasingly aware that certain dietaryhabits have been associated with some chronic, serious conditions and thatgood nutrition and diet are essential to good health. Thus, consumers alsohave expressed the need for information about the relationship betweenspecific food components and health and about how to select foods thatmay be used to improve their diets.In response to industry and consumer requests for health-related informationon food labeling, FDA proposed to amend the food regulations to establishcriteria for exempting a food with a health-related nutrition claim fromthe new drug provisions of the act (August 4, 1987; 52 FR 28843). Mostpersons who have an interest in this proposal acknowledge that consumersshould be provided with truthful and useful information about diet andhealth. However, this generally is the only point on which the variousinterest groups agree. On most other aspects of FDA's 1987 proposal, consumersand consumer advocacy groups, industry representatives, health professionals,and government officials generally are polarized in their opinions andexpectations. Points of controversy associated with the proposal include:1. Consideration of whether food labeling, in particular, is an appropriatevehicle for disseminating health-related dietary information concerningspecific diseases;2. The legal basis under the act for permitting health-related statementsthat traditionally would have rendered the food an unapproved new drug;3. Consideration of the type of foods for which health-related statementswould be permitted on the labeling;4. Establishment of practical and enforceable guidelines or criteria forevaluating whether the health-related dietary information is false or misleading;5. The level of scientific evidence that should be necessary prior to permittinghealth-related dietary information on food labeling;6. Whether a regulation to permit health-related dietary information onfood labeling would encourage over-fortification of foods with nutrientsfor which ``positive'' claims could be made;7. Whether FDA has sufficient resources to adequately monitor and enforcecompliance with a permissive regulation; and,8. Whether, and to what extent, the health messages policy should applyto dietary supplements.The extreme divergence of opinions on the legal, scientific, and practicalaspects of the 1987 proposal have impeded the agency's progress towarda resolultion. Thus, FDA considers it appropriate to request further commentsfrom interested persons. Specifically, the agency requests comments onthe approach or process that should be utilized to assure resolution ofthe issue. Options for resolution that the agency currently considers tobe available include:1. Revise the 1987 proposal based on comments received and publish therevision as a reproposal.2. Revise the 1987 proposed regulation based on comments received and publishthe revision as a final rule.3. Withdraw the 1987 proposal and publish a new proposal to permit foodlabeling to bear factual health-related statements on how, based on theirnormal use in a well-balanced diet, food components will affect the structureor function of the body to promote good health. This option, because ithas not been discussed before by the agency, needs some explanation.The 1987 proposal focused on health claims that conveyed information regardingthe role of a food in the prevention, cure, mitigation, or treatment ofa disease or a disease syndrome. The problem is that these types of effectsare also the types of effects that can be considered drug attributes undersection 201(g)(1)(B) of the act. Thus, the 1987 proposal created a tensionin FDA's enforcement of the act because any food that is labeled in themanner permitted by the proposal could, by definition, also be viewed asa drug.A label description of the effects that a food will have on the body neednot, however, make that food a drug. For example, the claim ``This productis high in calcium; dietary calcium is important to the maintenance ofstrong and health bones'' would fit this category. The act specificallyrecognizes, in section 201(g)(1)(C), that foods affect the structure orfunction, and thus the health, of the body in ways that do not make themdrugs. Foods have these effects by virtue of their nutritional qualitieswhen consumed over time and not as the result of an immediate pharmacologicalresponse as expected of drugs.The agency is interested in exploring the possibility of establishing aprogram that would permit manufacturers to make health claims that describethe nutritional qualities of a food and that explain, in a manner thatis not false or misleading, how these nutritional qualities affect thestructure or function of the body in ways that will contribute to goodhealth.FDA seeks comment on the feasibility and appropriateness of such a healthmessage policy.Interested persons may, on or before December 6, 1989, submit to the DocketsManagement Branch (address above) written comments regarding this advancenotice of proposed rulemaking; request for public comment.
