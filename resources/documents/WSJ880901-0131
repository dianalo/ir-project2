Schellhardt (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> RKWD WNEWS </CO><DATELINE> SOMERSET, Pa.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rockwood Holding Co., beset by severe losses the past nine months from unprofitable insurance business, named Gordon A. Ennis as president and chief executive officer to fill the top spot vacant since last April.    Mr. Ennis, 41 years old, has been chairman, president and chief executive of Merchants andamp; Business Men's Mutual Insurance Co., of Harrisburg, Pa., for the past three years and previously held executive positions for 18 years with the Allstate Insurance Co. unit of Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co.    He succeeds W.A. Thomas, 57, who retired from the property and casualty insurer after 30 years there.    Rockwood directors apparently chose Mr. Ennis because he has successfully managed two turnaround situations in the insurance business -- at Merchants andamp; Business Men's Mutual and at an Allstate unit -- and also has a strong financial background.    Rockwood, which long has specialized in workers' compensation, has had $26.4 million in losses in the past three quarters. In the first six months of 1988, the company had a loss of $8.7 million. Among other things, that loss reflected the company's poor performance in new businesses it entered to branch out from the workers' compensation area.    In late August, the company agreed to pay a unit of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. $1.2 million over the next four years to settle litigation involving financial-guarantee business.    Rockwood has been withdrawing in recent months from unprofitable lines of business and geographic areas, and it also has pared down its work force by 15%. It also is exploring sources of new capital. The company's consolidated shareholders' equity as of June 30 showed a $1.3 million deficit, although its two principal subsidiaries had a statutory surplus totaling about $21.6 million.    In an interview, Mr. Ennis said he intends to &quot;consolidate the company's operations into what traditionally has been its areas of skill and expertise: workers' compensation in the mining and extraction industries.&quot; Rockwood, he maintained, &quot;has formidable skills in that area and is well-respected.&quot;    Mr. Ennis said he believes Rockwood got into financial difficulty because its expansion efforts &quot;outstripped its ability to absorb those activities.&quot;    Separately, Rockwood said its Rockwood Insurance Co. subsidiary agreed to pay $99,900 to Illini Federal Savings andamp; Loan, of Fairview Heights, Ill., to settle outstanding litigation. </TEXT></DOC>
