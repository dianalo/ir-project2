MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The odds were heavily against Richard Gephardtwhen he sought the White House. Now he's on another track, and theodds are on his side. One day, the new leader of the HouseDemocratic majority can almost certainly become the 50th speaker ofthe House.   As his party's floor leader, he is in the job that has producedthe last 12 speakers. Rep. Thomas S. Foley's promotion from majorityleader to speaker two weeks ago opened the leadership spot forGephardt to win.   It's not the White House, but it's not bad work.   And of course, Gephardt's options are open.   He's ruled out a presidential bid in 1992. But at 48 he's gotplenty of time to change political goals again. With a 258-175majority over the Republicans _ in an era when incumbents seldomlose _ the Democrats are likely to be electing speakers for quite awhile.   Gephardt and Foley, who begins his speakership at 60, give theDemocrats a new-look team that blends the get-along skill of thelegislative insider with the political savvy of the nationalcampaigner. And Gephardt was known as an able congressionalpolitician before he tried to go national.   Third man in the leadership is the new Democratic whip, Rep.William H. Gray III of Pennsylvania. Gray, the first black to win atop leadership post, proved able and adept as chairman of the HouseBudget Committee where he held what had been a wavering Democraticline against the lure of Reaganomics.   Gephardt turned aside questions about his future presidentialambitions by saying the voters made that call for him in 1988. Buthe clearly had been planning another bid for the White House in 1992until the swift and unforeseeable shakeup that opened his path tothe leadership.   That came when Rep. Tony Coelho of California, the Democraticwhip, announced that he was resigning rather thn undergo an ethicsinvestigation into a 1986 junk bonds deal. He was in line to succeedFoley as majority leader with the resignation of Speaker Jim Wright.Coelho left the House on Thursday, his 47th birthday.   A few weeks earlier, Gephardt had mused aloud about the personaland financial demands of another bid for the presidentialnomination, saying he had not decided whether to take them on inadvance of 1992. He said he knew that would require him to getstarted soon and he didn't like that idea.   The question, he said then, was whether he could effectivelypursue his policy goals in Congress. Now, as majority leader, heintends to.   Gephardt said after winning the leader's job that he agreed withSpeaker Foley on the priority agenda, including ethics and campaignreform. Then he turned to the economic issues that were the themesof his 1988 campaign.   ``In my humble opinion, America is beginning to be in a state ofdecline,'' said Gephardt, who pressed issues of trade andproductivity during his presidential run. ``And we as Democrats haveto lead ... Even though the presidency is held by a different party,and even though getting our consensus together on the Democraticside is always difficult to do.''   Gephardt entered the Democratic presidential field as an earlyadvocate of tax reform and a champion of protectionist tradelegislation. ``It's your fight, too,'' was his message to the voters.   The seasoning he gained and the scrutiny he faced as apresidential candidate will serve Gephardt well in his new role.Like Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole, who ran twice for the WhiteHouse, he knows the techniques of national politics better thancolleagues who have done all their campaigning in home districts orcongressional cloakrooms.   Both he and Dole won the Iowa caucuses, the leadoff events of the1988 campaign, then foundered and were finished by the March 8 SuperTuesday primaries. Gephardt quit in time to file for reelection tothe House from his St. Louis district, saying he'd done his best,made his mistakes and had no complaints or alibis.   Gephardt faced sharp challenges in 1988 campaign debates forchanging his positions over the years on such issues as aconstitutional amendment to ban abortion, on school busing, onReaganomics. He said change was evidence of growth, of seekingbetter ways to do things. That explanation plays better in thecongressional world of compromise and consensus than in thepresidential campaign arena.   Now he's tried both, and says he is not going to use the Houseleadership as a stepping stone to anything else. ``You can't be aneffective majority leader and be running for president,'' he said.   As for the odds:   The last sitting House member to vault directly to the WhiteHouse was Rep. James A. Garfield, in 1880.   Not since 1919 has the House majority elected a speaker who didnot serve first as his party's floor leader.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Walter R.
