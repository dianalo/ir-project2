They are accused of financing their enemies, andeventually their own destruction.   They ``misgive.'' They support organizations that are boringholes in the hull of free enterprise. By acquiescing, says a prefaceto the report, business leaders are as culpable as those who mean todestroy the system.   In short, they give lots of money to left-leaning groups``advocating policies hostile to corporate interests,'' says theCapital Research Center, a private, Washington-based group thatmonitors corporate giving.   Leading the list are Dayton Hudson, Coca-Cola, General Mills,Pillsbury, Chemical Bank, Aetna Life andamp; Casualty, Atlantic Richfield,ATandamp;T, J.P. Morgan and Citicorp.   The listings are contained in ``Patterns of CorporatePhilanthropy,'' written by Roger E. Meiners and David N. Laband,Clemson University professors, with a preface by former TreasurySecretary William E. Simon.   The trend is not new, the center having documented it in asimilar volume last year by Marvin Olasky of the University ofTexas, who found that $7 of every $10 given by some companies wasfor causes deemed inimical to their interests.   And, says Simon, ``it existed for at least two decades beforethat.''   The book examines the public-affairs giving of the top 250companies as compiled by Forbes Magazine. Recipient organizationswere categorized under such labels as ``radical left'' or ``leftliberal'' or ``liberal center left.''   Groups with philosopical ratings of radical left were said tofavor a national restructuring along generally socialist lines, andto ``embody a a national security and foreign policy perspectivethat generally reflects ... the aims and interest of the Third Worldand Communist Bloc.''   Few groups rated a radical left label. In the domestic policyarea, the Center For Community Change was listed. Named in armscontrol and foreign policy, and in domestic policy, was theInstitute For Policy Studies. Also included was the American FriendsService Committee.   Groups labeled left _ tending to favor accommodation withanti-American Communist and Third World leaders in foreign policyand government action at the expense of free market and privatevoluntarisim _ include Jesse Jackson's Operation PUSH, the PeaceChild Foundation, and Feminist Press.   The liberal category was defined as ``establishment organizations(that) advocate policies that lean toward a major activist role forgovernment in economic and social welfare rpograms and greater trustin a detente-oriented appraoch to the Soviet Union and the CommunistBloc generally.''   Included in the liberal catgory was the Brookings Institution, awell-known Washington think tank with a tradition of involvement andinfluence in federal policy, and the National Planning Association.   ``It isn't surprising that big business would try to `buy off'some of its most outspoken critics,'' said Willa Anne Johnson,president of the center. ``Unfortunately, it doesn't work.''   She contended that many groups call themselves civil rightsorganizations, but ``a careful review of their activities showscontempt, and sometimes open hostility, toward the Americanenterprise system which makes progress possible.''   The ten companies named, ``and many others like them,'' she said,``are at the very least naive in their giving.''   The study showed that more than two-thirds of the grants made bythe Forbes 250 companies went to liberal organizations, and suchorganizations received 58.5 percent of the grant dollars comparedwith 36 percent donated to the more conservative groups.   Said Simon, a wealthy businessman, investor and president of theJohn M. Olin Foundation:   ``What is going on is that leaders of the American freeenterprise system, or people acting in their name and with corporateprofits _ are financing the destruction of their own system andultimately of our free society.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Friday, Jan. 20.</NOTE></DOC>
