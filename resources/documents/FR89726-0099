(the licensee) for operationof Indian Point Nuclear Generating Unit No. 2 located in Westchester County,New York.  The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specification to authorizeoperation of the plant with Hudson River (ultimate heat sink) water temperaturesof up to a maximum of 95anddegrees; F and with containment air temperaturesof up to a maximum of 130anddegrees; F when the reactor is operating. Thelicensee's application for this amendment is contained in its submittalof July 13, 1989.  Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission willhave made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended(the Act) and the Commission's regulations.  The Commission has made a proposed determination that the request for amendmentinvolves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulationsin 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordancewith the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated;or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety.  The licensee provided the following analysis of the proposed changes: <ITAG tagnum="73">[Service Water System (SWS)] Temperature  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Commission has provided guidance concerning the application ofthe standards for determining whether a significant hazards considerationexists by providing certain examples in 51 FR 7751. Example (i) relatesto a purely administrative change to Technical Specifications. The proposedchange to Technical Specification 3.3.F.1.b and 3.3.F.2.b changes [two]LCO action requirements and wording to be consistent with other 350anddegrees;F LCOs in our Technical Specifications. These proposed changes would alsoeliminate an unnecessary restriction (i.e., be below 200anddegrees; F within30 hours), because the LCOs 3.3.F.1.a and 3.3.F.2.a only apply above RCStemperature of 350anddegrees; F. Also, changes to Technical SpecificationBases 3.3 page 3.3-14 adds reference (12) and corrects a footnote error.Thus these proposed changes reflect such an example.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Example (ii) relates to a change that constitutes an additional limitation,restriction or control not presently included in the Technical Specifications.The proposed changes to Technical Specification 3.3.F.4 and 3.3.F.5 imposenew Limiting Conditions for Operation for service water inlet temperatureand associated monitoring instrumentation. Additionally, changes to TechnicalSpecification Table 4.1-1 imposes surveillance requirements for the servicewater inlet temperature monitoring instrumentation. Thus, these proposedchanges reflect such an example.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Example (vi) relates to a change which either may result in some increaseto the probability or consequences of a previously-analyzed accident ormay reduce in some was a safety margin, but where the results of the changeare clearly within all acceptable criteria. The proposed change to TechnicalSpecification 5.2.C and Technical Specification Bases 3.3 pages 3.3-10and 3.3-11 increases the limit on service water temperature from 85anddegrees;F to 95anddegrees; F and reflects such an example.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, in accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.92, theproposed changes to Technical Specification 3.3.F, to Technical Specification5.2.C, Technical specification table 4.1-1, and to technical SpecificationBasis 3.3 with respect to a maximum SWS inlet temperature of 95anddegrees;F, are deemed to involve ``No Significant Hazards Considerations'' becauseoperation of Indian Point Unit No. 2, in accordance with these changeswould not:  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">With respect to a significant increase in the probability of an accidentpreviously evaluated, [the safety analysis provided with this submittal]analyzed the cooling provided to safety-related and non-safety-relatedequipment by the SWS and [Component Cooling Water System (CCWS)] duringnormal operation, assuming a maximum SWS inlet temperature of 95anddegrees;F. The analysis determined that with a maximum SWS inlet temperature of95anddegrees; F, there will not be an increase in the probability of thesudden failure of equipment cooled by SWS or CCWS, whose failure couldcause an accident evaluated in the FSAR, (i.e. loss of reactor coolantflow due to the sudden failure of a RCP, loss of normal feedwater due tothe sudden failure of a main feedwater pump, or reactor coolant systemfailures due to inadequate reactor vessel support cooling). Thus, thesechanges would not significantly increase the probability of an accidentpreviously evaluated.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">With respect to a significant increase in the consequences of an accidentpreviously evaluated, [the safety analysis provided with this submittal]evaluated the adequacy of the cooling provided by the SWS and CCW[S] duringoff-normal and postulated accident conditions.

The [analysis] concluded that all applicable safety limitsare met. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, based on the above discussion [the licensee] has determinedthat the proposed changes to Technical Specification 3.3F, Technical Specification4.1-1, Technical Specification 5.2.C and Technical Specification Basis3.3 with respect to a maximum SWS inlet temperature of 95anddegrees; F, involve``No Significant Hazards Considerations.'' * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Containment Integrity</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Commission has provided guidance concerning the application ofthe standards for determining whether a significant hazards considerationexists by providing certain examples (51 FR 7751).

Therefore, based on theabove considerations, the Commission has made a proposed determinationthat the amendment request involves no significant hazards considerations.The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination.Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of thisnotice will be considered in making any final determination. The Commissionwill not normally make a final determination unless it receives a requestfor a hearing. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Regulatory PublicationsBranch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Officeof Administration and Resources Management, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page numberof this<T4> Federal Register</T4> notice. Written comments may also be deliveredto Room 223, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda, MD from7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Copies of written comments received may be examinedat the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW.,Washington, DC. The filing of requests for a hearing and petitions forleave to intervene are discussed below. By August 25, 1989, the licensee may file a request for hearing with respectto issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating licenseand any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and whowishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a writtenpetition for leave to intervene. Request for a hearing and petitions forleave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rulesof Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. If arequest for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by theabove date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designatedby the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and LicensingBoard Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition and the Secretaryor the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a noticeof hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding,and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) Thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and and (3) the possible effect ofany order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described below. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contentionset forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited tomatters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determinationon the issue of not significant hazards considerations. The final determinationwill serve to decide when the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the request for amendment involves nosignificant hazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendmentand make it effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearingheld would take place after issuance of the amendment. If a final determination is that the amendment involves significant hazardsconsiderations, any hearing held would take place before the issuance ofany amendment. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expirationof the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change duringthe notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result,for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission mayissue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day noticeperiod, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involvesno significant hazards considerations. The final determination will considerall public and State comments received. Should the Commission take thisaction, it will publish a notice of issuance and provide for opportunityfor a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to takethis action will occur very infrequently. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may bedelivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC, by the above date. Where petitions arefiled during the last ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requestedthat the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephonecall to Western Union at 1-(800) 325-6000 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number3737 and the following message addressed to Robert A. Capra: (petitioner'sname and telephone number), (date petition was mailed), (plant name), and(publication date and page number of this<T4> Federal Register</T4> notice). A copy of the petition should alsobe sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and to Brent L. Brandenberg, Esq. 4 Irving Place,New York, NY 10003, attorney for the licensee. Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions,supplemental petitions and/or requests for hearing will not be entertainedabsent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or theAtomic Safety and Licensing Board designated to rule on the petititionand/or request, that the petitioner has made a substantial showing of goodcause for the granting of a later petition and/or request. That determinationwill be based upon a balancing of the factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v)and 2.714(d).
