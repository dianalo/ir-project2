The gritty industrial city was the cradle of East Germany'speaceful popular revolt last fall that later swelled into the drivefor unification.   To celebrate the merger Wednesday, thousands of its residentsshopped and drank as the heart of the city was turned into a hugeopen-air market. Western business people cashed in on the officialholiday by trucking in stalls that offered everything from leatherjackets to candy.   But it was a time for reflection as well, especially for tens ofthousands in Leipzig who helped free their country by going to thestreets to demand an end to totalitarianism.   Those weekly Monday marches began at the Lutheran church andthen spread along downtown streets to the headquarters of theonce-feared secret police. Demonstrators chanted ``We Are thePeople!'' - a phrase that quickly became a nationwide motto forpro-democracy groups.   The day of reckoning came Oct. 9, 1989, almost exactly one yearago.   News reports at the time said Communist leader Erich Honeckerwas considering ordering troops to shoot at the more than 70,000demonstrators that night, hoping to end the pro-democracy movement.   ``The whole city was tense, the hospitals even had extra bloodbrought in case there was a disaster,'' said Sven Hornig, 25, oneof the marchers who gathered at the church that night.   Miraculously, there was no bloodshed.   Leipzig dignitaries, including famed conductor Kurt Masur, andlocal party officials intervened to prevent violence - breaking theauthoritarian hold of Honecker's government.   Honecker was ousted from power nine days later.   Since then, St. Nicholas Church has become something of ashrine.   On Wednesday, hundreds of tourists and residents milled aroundon the cobblestone square where the old church stands.   ``I marched on Oct. 9,'' said one drunken Leipziger, trying tokeep his balance on a bar stool on Sachsen Square.   ``For 10 marks, I will tell you all about it.''   Like many Leipzigers, he was proud of his role in changingGerman history, but the solidarity that brought that change isgone. Many leftists and artists in Leipzig oppose the dissolutionof East Germany, saying the nation could have been salvaged as anew democracy.   More conservatives Germans say unity was the only answer.   ``At the time (last fall), we were all limiting our demands todemocracy because no one knew how bad the economy was,'' Hornigsaid. ``There would have been a total collapse and chaos withoutunification.''   Leipzig hopes to take advantage of its role in changing Germanyto become one of Europe's most important cultural and tradecenters. It already has impressive musical and stage offerings andan annual trade fair.   But many of the city's buildings are nearly in ruins after 40years of Communist neglect. Right-wing extremism is rising intandem with joblessness and despair among many Leipzig youths.   After church bells pealed German unity at midnight Tuesday,about 100 masked neo-Nazis demolished cars, smashed windows withclubs and fought with police. Six people were injured, and many ofthe radicals were arrested.   The unrest in Leipzig presents a united Germany with a newchallenge: to meet the hopeful expectations of those who took tothe streets to bury East Germany.</TEXT></DOC>
