<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-25-1079 </DOCNO><TEXT>Petroleum and mineral resources projects in Canada are often financedby lenders in a range of full recourse to non-recourse lending, whichmeans that the lender has recourse beyond the project to the assets andcash flow of the sponsors or that the lender has no call on the assetsof their sponsors and the project is the sole source of repayment andsecurity to the lender. This paper discusses the Canadian perspectiveof project financing of a mineral or petroleum resource property andwhat is required of a project sponsor when borrowing funds from a Canadianlender. In financing production in the petroleum and mineral industriesin Canada it is common practice for the lender to be satisfied that alllicenses, permits, rights of way, and environmental approvals are inplace. Additionally, the lender would likely have an independent consultingengineer evaluate the geological and geophysical interpretation of thepetroleum deposit and its resulting reserve and recoverable reserve estimates.Project development plans and production profiles are reviewed and independentopinions are provided concerning the economic value of the resources.These and other aspects of project financing are discussed. 3 refs.,8 figs.,</TEXT></DOC>
