<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-13-0596 </DOCNO><TEXT>Papers are presented on the analysis of Ada as a prototyping language;the evaluation of a dual processor implementation for a fault inferringnonlinear detection system; fault-tolerant systems; intelligent interfacesto aircraft systems; the implementation of a research prototype on afault monitoring and diagnosis system; future data acquisition capabilities;and the application of AI technology to the analysis and synthesis ofreliable software systems. Topics discussed include the spaceplane'sastronaut's associate; model-based health monitoring for reusable launchvehicles; Space Shuttle telemetry analysis by a real-time expert system;avionics, AI, and embedded processing systems; methodology requirementsfor intelligent systems architecture; and commonsense reasoning and superconductivityfor self-replicating telerobots. Consideration is given to autonomousspacecraft operations; semiautonomous control for satellite servicing;and expert system control for airborne radar surveillance.</TEXT></DOC>
