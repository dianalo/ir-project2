HilderStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 09/22/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FINFINANCIAL, INSURANCE, MUTUAL FUNDS, ACCOUNTING, LEASING (FIN)BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK)SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) </IN><TEXT>   Financial Corp. of America, troubled parent of the nation's largest thrift, settled charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission that it illegally reported inflated profits in various annual and quarterly reports filed from 1980 to 1986.    Irvine, Calif.-based Financial Corp. settled the charges without admitting or denying guilt and without restating earnings for any period. The company agreed, however, to hire its outside accounting firm, Peat Marwick Main andamp; Co., to review internal controls on accounting for loans and real estate and to have its quarterly financial statements audited by the firm in 1988 and 1989. Peat Marwick currently audits the company's annual financial statement but doesn't audit quarterly reports.    The SEC said that Financial Corp. inflated its earnings by $13.3 million in 1980 and by $7 million in 1981 by improperly accounting for certain land sale and loan transactions. Those profits subsequently were wiped out by more than $1.15 billion of charges for loan-loss reserves that have been taken since late 1984.    The SEC said that it couldn't identify the exact amount of inflated profit caused by other improper accounting practices because Financial Corp. didn't maintain adequate books and records on the condition of many loans that turned sour.    Most of the charges concern accounting practices used for financial statements issued before August 1984, when Charles W. Knapp was forced out as chairman of Financial Corp. by federal thrift regulators.    But the SEC also charged that under William J. Popejoy, Mr. Knapp's successor and Financial Corp.'s current chairman, the company filed potentially misleading quarterly reports for the first three quarters of 1985 and 1986.    The SEC said that because of &quot;the inadequacies in FCA's accounting systems and internal controls procedures,&quot; the company &quot;was unable to ensure&quot; that its quarterly financial reports &quot;reflected the losses in FCA's loan and real estate portfolios in a timely fashion.&quot;    The SEC said that Financial Corp.'s fourth-quarter and annual reports for 1985 and 1986 reflected adequate loan-loss reserves. The company took a $182 million loan-loss provision for the year 1985 and a $464 million provision for the year 1986. The SEC said it isn't possible to determine how the provisions should have been allocated among the quarters of each year.    In a statement, Financial Corp. said it is &quot;pleased to put FCA's inherited problems with the SEC behind us. It is important to note that the SEC complaint recognizes that current FCA management has improved the company's accounting systems and controls substantially.&quot;    In its charges concerning Mr. Knapp's tenure at Financial Corp., the SEC alleged that the company failed to maintain adequate loan-loss reserves because the company's rapid growth caused a decline in loan underwriting standards, appraisal policies and internal controls. The SEC also charged that the company &quot;maintained an institutional policy of attempting to minimize its reserve requirements.&quot;    For example, the SEC said, Financial Corp.'s staff and former outside auditor, Arthur Andersen andamp; Co., recommended a reserve balance of $146.8 million at year-end 1983. However, the company set the balance at only $98.3 million, the SEC said, and Arthur Andersen gave a clean audit opinion for the year.    The SEC also charged that Financial Corp. inflated reported profits from loans made for real estate development by failing to classify the loans as joint ventures or investments even though they entailed bigger-than-normal risks and shouldn't have been classified as loans.    Through a spokesman, Mr. Knapp said he is pleased with the settlement, which he said &quot;appears appropriate since it required no penalty.&quot; Arthur Andersen declined to comment on the settlement.    Financial Corp. still faces major problems. It reported a $167.6 million loss for the first six months of 1987, compared with net income of $60.7 million or $1.44 a share a year earlier. The capital of its main unit, American Savings andamp; Loan Association, is short of regulatory requirements by $928 million, and analysts believe it may have as much as $2.5 billion of unrealized losses in its $17.9 billion portfolio of mortgage-backed securities. </TEXT></DOC>
