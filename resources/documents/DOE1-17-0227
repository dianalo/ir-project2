<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-17-0227 </DOCNO><TEXT>We have measured electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), electrical resistivity,and dc magnetic susceptibility from 2 K - 300 K for the high Tsub(c)oxide superconductor EuBa/sub 2/Cu/sub 3/Osub(9-x), either undoped ordoped with 3d ions (Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Co, or Zn), which presumably substituteat the Cu sites. We have observed an EPR line at low temperatures (Tandless;40 K), which exhibits an increase in intensity and decrease in fieldfor resonance as the temperature is lowered. The EPR linewidth is alsotemperature dependent and exhibits a minimum at about 15 K. In some ofthe samples another EPR signal is observed over the entire temperaturerange studied, with properties that depend on sample preparation conditions.This signal is likely to be due to small amounts of an additional phase.The behavior and origin of these EPR signals are discussed. The variationof Tsub(c) with 3d ion concentration over the range (1 - 8%) is alsopresented.</TEXT></DOC>
