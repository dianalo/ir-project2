The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said net deposits at the 3,113federally insured thrift institutions increased by $1.2 billion to$962.4 billion in April, the seventh consecutive monthly increase.   ``The steady deposit gains continue to indicate consumerconfidence in thrifts as a secure haven for funds,'' the bank boardsaid in a statement.   Deposit growth slowed in April when compared with the $4.3billion jump in March, but bank board economist James Barth saiddeposit receipts normally decline in April as people pay theirfederal income taxes. He said the slowdown this year was milderthan usual.   Net deposits during the first four months of this year totaled$16.3 billion. That was a reversal of the trend a year ago, whenthere were net withdrawals of $14.3 billion in the same period.   The growth occurred as the bank board stepped up the pace of Sandamp;Lclosings. So far this year, 37 institutions have been closed or,with government assistance, merged into other Sandamp;Ls.   The General Accounting Office, the auditing arm of Congress,warned last month that in several years there may not be enoughmoney coming into the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. toresolve the cases of the estimated 500 insolvent institutions.   However, Congress has pledged the full faith and credit of theUnited States in backing the accounts should FSLIC run dry.   Deposits had drained steadily from Sandamp;Ls during much of 1987 inwhat analysts called a ``slow-motion run.'' But after the Octobermarket crash, many investors sought the safety of federally insuredaccounts and pulled their money out of stocks.   The bank board report, a summary of Sandamp;L balance sheets,highlighted a more worrisome trend: the continued decline of thriftinstitutions' capital.   Capital represents the money that would be left over for aninstitution's owners should all its assets be sold and liabilitiespaid off. The more capital an institution has, the less dangerthere is that it will become insolvent.   The industry's capital declined by $390 million in April,following a $2.7 billion decline in March. However, $1.2 billion ofthe March drop was attributed to losses at a single institution,Sunbelt Savings Association in Dallas.   In the first four months of 1988, capital declined by $3.85billion, compared with a gain of $1.37 billion in the comparableperiod of 1987.   The report also said the thrift industry increased its mortgagelending in April to $18.6 billion, up $200 million from March but24 percent below a year ago.   Analysts expect a decline in mortgage lending as rising interestrates slow home buying and building this summer.</TEXT></DOC>
