Judge Clive Jones of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved the final bid by Masao Nangaku late yesterday, a lawyer for Mr. Nangaku said. The Dunes property, which includes a hotel and casino and golf course on 163 acres along the so-called Strip, is controlled by John B. Anderson, a wealthy California farmer and real estate investor. The property is operated by a unit of the parent, Dunes Hotels andamp; Casinos Inc.    Mr. Nangaku, whose Minami Shoji Co. operates hotels, retailing and real estate interests in Japan, had earlier signed a tentative agreement with Dunes management to purchase the property for between $135 million and $140 million. The offer topped an earlier bid of $127.5 million by Hilton Hotels, but was raised yesterday after several competing bids were entered in the Las Vegas court.    Representatives of Mr. Kerkorian made a final offer of $152 million with the stipulation that the sale close by December. A group of Indonesian investors offered $135 million, and a group headed by Henri Lewin and Sheldon Adelson, a trade show promoter, offered $142 million. Two other offers of $155 million and $200 million were rejected by the court when the parties couldn't deposit a minimum of $5 million in earnest money.    A spokesman for Mr. Kerkorian didn't return telephone calls to his office. Messrs. Lewin and Adelson, and lawyers for Hilton Hotels and the Indonesian investors couldn't be reached for comment. Dunes officials also couldn't be reached.    Dunes Hotels andamp; Casinos has total debts of about $153 million and had earlier considered filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. The unit operating the hotel-casino filed for bankruptcy-law protection in November 1985.    Barry Goold, a lawyer representing Mr. Nangaku, said the deadline to close the sale is Dec. 15. Mr. Nangaku hopes to sign a long-term management contract with current Dunes executives or make other arrangements to keep the property operating while he applies for a gambling license, Mr. Goold said. The licensing process can take a year or longer. </TEXT></DOC>
