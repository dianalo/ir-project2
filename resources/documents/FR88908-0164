Background</ITAG>Administration of the Medicare program is governed by the Medicare statute,title XVIII of the Social Security Act (the Act). The Medicare law providescoverage for broad categories of benefits, including inpatient and outpatienthospital care, skilled nursing facility (SNF) care, home health care, andphysicians' services. It places general and categorical limitations onthe coverage of the services furnished by certain health care practitioners,such as dentists, chiropractors and podiatrists, and it specifically excludessome categories of services from coverage, such as cosmetic surgery, personalcomfort items, custodial care, routine physical checkups, and proceduresthat are not reasonable and necessary for diagnosis or treatment. The statutealso provides direction as to the manner in which payment is made for Medicareservices, the rules governing eligibility for services, and the health,safety and quality standards to be met by institutions providing servicesto Medicare beneficiaries.The Medicare law does not, however, provide an all-inclusive list of specificitems, services, treatments, procedures, or technologies covered by Medicare.Thus, except for the examples of durable medical equipment in section 1861(n)of the Act, and some of the medical and other health services listed insections 1861(s) and 1862(a) of the Act, the statute does not specify medicaldevices, surgical procedures, or diagnostic or therapeutic services thatshould be covered or excluded from coverage. The intention of Congress, at the time the Medicare Act was enacted in1965, was that Medicare would provide health insurance to protect the elderlyor disabled from the substantial costs of acute health care services, principallyhospital care. The provision was designed generally to cover services ordinarilyfurnished by hospitals, SNFs, and physicians licensed to practice medicine.Congress understood that questions as to coverage of specific serviceswould invariably arise and would require a specific decision of coverageby those administering the program. Thus, it vested in the Secretary theauthority to make those decisions. Specifically, section 1862(a)(1)(A)of the Act prohibits payment for any expenses incurred for items or services``which are not reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatmentof illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed bodymember.'' We have interpreted this statutory provision to exclude from Medicare coveragethose medical and health care services that are not demonstrated to besafe and effective by acceptable clinical evidence. Effectiveness in thiscontext is defined as the probability of benefit to individuals from amedical technology for a given medical problem under actual conditionsof use. In day-to-day medical practice, physicians diagnose and treat clinicalconditions following their performance of history and physical examinationsand their interpretations of a variety of diagnostic tests and procedures.To be of value to the physician in confirming the presence or absence ofa given disease, the information obtained from any diagnostic test or proceduremust be of sufficient accuracy to establish or rule out the presence ofthat disease. Likewise, for established diagnoses, the test or proceduremust be of sufficient precision to allow the physician to accurately monitorthe patient's response to treatment. Payment may not be made under Medicarefor any diagnostic test or procedure that is not accurate or precise, sincesuch a test cannot be considered ``reasonable and necessary for the diagnosisor treatment of illness or injury''. While medical procedures may proveto be efficacious in a research setting, under ideal circumstances (thatis, controlled environment, scientifically trained users, optimally functioningequipment, etc.) their efficacy may not extend to less controlled settings.On April 29, 1987, we published a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (52 FR 15560) that describes the process we usein reaching coverage decisions. That notice includes a discussion of ourreliance on the Office of Health Technology Assessment (OHTA) in the PublicHealth Service (PHS) for medical advice. The Medicare program currently covers single photon absorptiometry, radiographicabsorptiometry (photodensitometry), and bone biopsy for measuring bonemineral density. Dual photon absorptiometry currently is not covered. Bone mineral density studies are used to diagnose diseases of the boneand to evaluate the responses of bone diseases to treatment. The studiesassess bone mass or density associated with such diseases as osteoporosis,osteomalacia, and renal osteodystrophy. Various methods of measurementmay be used to diagnose bone disease and monitor the response to treatment,including, bone biopsy, radiographic absorptiometry (photodensitometry),and single and dual photon absorptiometry. A bone biopsy is an invasive surgical procedure. A small sample of bone(usually from the hip) is removed, generally by a biopsy needle. The biopsysample is then examined histologically, and provides a qualitative measurementof the bone mineral content of the trabecular bone. This procedure is usedprimarily to differentiate osteomalacia from osteoporosis. Bone biopsyis covered under Medicare when used for the qualitative evaluation of boneno more than four times per patient, unless special justification is given.When used more than four times on a patient, bone biopsy may leave a defectin the pelvis and produce some patient discomfort. Radiographic absorptiometry (photodensitometry) is a noninvasive radiologicalprocedure that attempts to assess bone mass by measuring the optical densityof extremity radiographs with a photodensitometer, usually with a referenceto a standard density wedge placed on the film at the time of exposure.This procedure provides a quantitative measurement of the bone mineralof cortical bone, and is used for monitoring gross bone change. Radiographic absorptiometry (photodensitometry) was covered in 1975 atthe recommendation of the Bureau of Health Insurance's (predecessor toHCFA) in-house medical consultants based on the limited medical informationavailable at that time. This decision was made prior to the inception ofthe HCFA Physicians Panel and OHTA review and assessment process. Sincethat time additional studies have been conducted, with the result thatthe available evidence as set forth in current medical literature no longersupports Medicare's coverage position. Single photon absorptiometry is a non-invasive radiological technique thatmeasures absorption of a monochromatic photon beam by bone material. Thedevice is placed directly on the patient, uses a low dose of radionuclide,and measures the mass absorption efficiency of the energy used. It providesa quantitative measurement of the bone mineral of cortical and trabecularbone, and is used in assessing an individual's treatment response at appropriateintervals. Single photon absorptiometry has been covered under Medicarewhen used in assessing changes in bone density of patients with osteodystrophyor osteoporosis when performed on the same individual at intervals of sixto 12 months. Single photon absorptiometry was covered under Medicare based on the adviceand recommendation of the Office of Health Research, Statistics, and Technology(OHRST), PHS on September 10, 1982. OHRST stated that while no single currentlyavailable technique was entirely satisfactory for assessing either thedegree or type of bone disease in individual patients, they recommendedthat single photon absorptiometry be covered under Medicare because ``Theredoes <T3>appear</T3> to be evidence to support the clinical effectiveness ofphoton absorptiometry * * *'' Since that time additional studies have beenconducted, with the result that the available evidence as set forth incurrent medical literature no longer supports Medicare's coverage position.Dual photon absorptiometry is a noninvasive radiological technique thatmeasures absorption of a dichromatic beam by bone material. This procedureis not covered under Medicare because it is still considered to be in theinvestigational stage. The issue of the safety and effectiveness of dual photon absorptiometrywas considered by the HCFA Physicians Panel on January 11, 1984. The HCFAPhysicians Panel is an internal organization composed of physicians andother health professionals in HCFA's Central Office and their counterpartsfrom PHS, which meets approximately once every six to eight weeks. At thattime, the Panel recommended that HCFA refer the issue to PHS for its reviewwith specific direction to OHTA to report back to HCFA after it had reviewedthe data presented at a Consensus Conference on Osteoporosis at the NationalInstitutes of Health (NIH) in April of 1984.OHTA reported on the NIH conference at the Panel meeting held May 15, 1984.The NIH conference was unable to reach a consensus on the effectivenessin the clinical setting of any of the currently available tests for studyingbone mineral density. The discussion generated by this information ledHCFA to question whether these techniques were medically necessary, giventhe current state of therapy for osteoporosis. A major conclusion of theNIH conference was that while there are a number of promising treatmentsavailable for osteoporosis, there was no single treatment available toeither prevent or cure the condition. The Panel then recommended that OHTAbe requested to do a full assessment of the effectiveness of all typesof bone mineral density studies.On June 1, 1984, we requested that OHTA assess the issue of the safetyand effectiveness of all currently used bone mineral density studies_radiographicabsorptiometry (photodensitometry), single photon absorptiometry, dualphoton absorptiometry, and computerized tomography (CT) scans. In a <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice published October 26, 1984, OHTA announcedthat it was coordinating an assessment of what is known of the safety,clinical effectiveness, and use of bone mineral density studies. Duringits assessment, OHTA solicited information and advice from other PHS components(such as the Food and Drug Administration and NIH), consulted directlywith concerned medical specialty groups and professional organizationsto determine whether a consensus exists within the medical community concerningthe safety and effectiveness of bone mineral density studies, and researchedand analyzed published medical and scientific literature and findings ofall relevant studies and reports. On December 31, 1986, OHTA recommendedthat we not cover single photon absorptiometry under Medicare (includingthe ESRD program), and continue to deny Medicare coverage of dual photonabsorptiometry. On September 22, 1987, OHTA recommended that we not coverradiographic absorptiometry (photodensitometry) under Medicare.According to the OHTA assessment, the use of radiographic absorptiometry(photodensitometry), single photon absorptiometry, and dual photon absorptiometryfor diagnosing bone loss or monitoring effectiveness of treatment is unproven.Currently, there is a lack of medical evidence supporting their effectivenessas either diagnostic tools or methods of monitoring treatments for bonedisease when used outside the research setting. Because of significantvariation among observers in obtaining measurements, and because measurementsby the same observer at different times vary to a considerable degree,the accuracy of these measurements must be considered open to question.Moreover, it has not been determined which site or sites are best suitedfor measurement. When used as a guide to monitoring treatment responsethe degree of change in bone density expected is smaller than the precisionerror of the devices themselves, thereby making such measurements unsuitablefor this purpose. OHTA has advised that radiographic absorptiometry (photodensitometry),single photon absorptiometry, and dual photon absorptiometry need to undergofurther clinical investigation before being recommended for general clinicaluse. OHTA has, therefore, concluded that the available clinical and scientificevidence does not support the effectiveness in a day-to-day clinical setting,of radiographic absorptiometry (photodensitometry), single photon absorptiometry,and dual photon absorptiometry in measuring bone mineral density for eitherdiagnostic or treatment monitoring purposes.HCFA has received recently comments form clinicians and others challengingthe OHTA assessments of the effectiveness of radiographic absorptiometry(photodensitometry), single photon absorptiometry, and dual photon absorptiometryin measuring bone mineral density for either diagnostic or treatment monitoringpurposes that may have a substantial, credible basis. These comments willbe available for public inspection during the comment period for this noticeand will be addressed in the final notice if we proceed with publishingone.OHTA is currently assessing the safety and effectiveness of computerizedtomography (CT) scans when used to measure bone mineral density.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Provisions of the Proposed Notice</ITAG>We propose to exclude radiographic absorptiometry (photodensitometry) andsingle photon absorptiometry for measuring bone mineral density from Medicarecoverage (including coverage under the ESRD program) for either diagnosticpurposes or as a guide to treatment, and to continue noncoverage of dualphoton absorptiometry.The provisions of this notice would not affect any existing Medicare regulations.However, they would affect the following manual instructions:andbullet; Coverage Issues Manual_Section 50-17, paragraph A, LaboratoryTests_CRD Patients; and Section 50-44, Bone Mineral Density Studies;andbullet; Renal Dialysis Facility Manual_Section 240.3, paragraph D, LaboratoryTests;andbullet; Hospital Manual_Section 238.2, paragraph D.3., Institutional DialysisServices Furnished to CAPD Patients_Laboratory Tests;andbullet; Intermediary Manual_Section 3172.3, Laboratory Tests for Hemodialysis,Intermittent Pertioneal Dialysis (IPD) and Continuous Cycling PertionealDialysis (CCPD) Included in the Composite Rate_Guidelines for SeparatelyBillable Tests for Hemodialysis, IPD, and CCPD; andandbullet; Carriers Manual_Section 2231.3, Support Services and SuppliesFurnished to Home CAPD Patients, paragraph D.3., Laboratory Tests; andSection 4270, paragraph C.3., Guidelines for Separately Billable Testsfor Hemodialysis, IPD, and CCPD.<ITAG tagnum="84">III.

Regulatory Impact Statement</ITAG>Executive Order (E.O.) 12291 requires us to prepare and publish an initialregulatory impact analysis for any proposed notice that meets one of theE.O. criteria for a ``major rule''; that is, that would be likely to resultin: An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; a major increasein costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State,or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or significant adverseeffects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets. In addition, we generally preparean initial regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with theRegulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612), unless theSecretary certifies that a proposed notice such as this would not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.Although radiographic absorptiometry has been covered since 1975, the firstyear for which Medicare coverage was available for single photon absorptiometrywas 1985. The limited data available to us show the total 1985 Medicarecharges for both procedures were significantly less than $1 million. Thisproposal would affect those clinics and other facilities that are offeringthis testing in two ways: first, they would lose Medicare revenue, andsecond, our coverage decision may affect other payers (such as, third parties)and their beneficiaries. Nonetheless, we believe the economic impact ofthis notice would not be significant.For these reasons, we have determined that a regulatory impact analysisis not required. Further, we have determined and the Secretary certifiesthat this proposed notice would not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities, and we have therefore not prepareda regulatory flexibility analysis.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Response To Comments</ITAG>Because of the large number of comments we receive on proposed notices,we cannot acknowledge or respond to them individually. However, in preparingthe final notice, we will consider all comments received timely and respondto the major issues in that notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI.
