February import contracts were down 2.5% from the yearbefore.</LP><TEXT>   Export contracts totaled 941.4 billion yen ($6.66 billion)in February, as most categories showed declines, the councilsaid. Meanwhile, import contracts edged down to 1.071trillion yen. Sharp drops were seen in the metals andwood-products categories, the council said.   The council attributed about 80% of the overall decline inexport contracts to decreases in the machinery and metalexport categories.   In the machinery category, which dropped 6.3%, contractsfor plants fell 38.6%. The council noted, however, that thedecline reflected a downturn after enormous growth last yearin plant contracts, particularly for steelmaking facilitiesin Southeast Asia. A rapid drop was also seen in contractsfor large-scale plants, but the council termed the declinetemporary.   Automobile and ship export contracts also decreased inFebruary from the prior year.   Metal export contracts fell 24.9% in the month, draggeddown by nonferrous metal products and parts, such as thoseused in the electronics industry.   By region, export contracts to Southeast Asia tumbled24.4%, mostly because of extremely strong growth in theyear-earlier period. On the other hand, export contracts toLatin America jumped 85% from the year before because ofdemand for tankers and automobiles, while those to Oceaniaand South Africa rose 33% on demand for autmobiles and othermachinery.</TEXT></DOC>
