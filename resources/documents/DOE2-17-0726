The industrial size fluidized bedsteam dryer operated 1,500 h in 1986, producing 7,500 t of briquettingcoal. Technical specifications include: 10.2 t/h dry coal productioncapacity, application of 160 C steam at 0.47 MPa for drying comminutedcoal (0 to 6.3 mm grain size, with 54.5% coal moisture) to 19% moisturecontent. The dryer design is explained as well as results of performancetesting. Operational obstacles and required dryer design modificationsare noted. Applicability of this dryer technology to industrial browncoal drying was proved. Economic advantages of steam drying are alsodescribed. The IfE institute is responsible for developing a new typeof fluidized bed steam dryer that is planned to achieve a 25 to 30% economiceffect by automated operation and waste heat utilization. It will fitin size in existing GDR briquetting plants. 6 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
