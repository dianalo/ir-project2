(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Florida's privacy laws should beextended to minors, a lawyer told the state Supreme Court Tuesday inthe case of a teen-ager forced to ask a judge to allow an abortionwithout parental consent.   ``The statute clearly fails to protect a minor's privacy right,''attorney Jerri Blair told the justices. ``A minor who is pregnanthas a right to submit to any medical procedure except abortion underFlorida law.   ``There is no question it should be applied to the minor'sabortion decision,'' Ms. Blair told reporters later.   The Florida law requires unmarried minors to get permission fromtheir parents or a judge before having an abortion.   The case argued Tuesday began when Ms. Blair's client, a15-year-old known only as ``T.W.,'' did not want to tell her parentsabout her pregnancy _ then in its 11th week _ and sought judicialpermission for an abortion.   A Lake County judge denied her request last month, saying thestate law was vague and unworkable. An appeals court then ruled thelaw unconstitutional, and a series of legal maneuvers landed thecase in the U.S. Supreme Court, which returned the case to statejustices without comment.   The U.S. Supreme Court has left the law unenforceable until theFlorida high court reviews it.   Suporters of the law contend it protects the unborn and the rightof parents to supervise their children.   ``When you elevate the right of privacy over the right to life,you have elevated an inferior right over a superior right,'' saidKen Connor, a Tallahassee attorney for Florida Right to Life.``Without the right to life, there is no right to privacy.''   Attorney James Bopp Jr. of Terre Haute, Ind., who served asguardian for the fetus, argued that minors are not mature enough tomake decisions about abortion.   ``I don't believe the people of Florida intended to subvertparental rights (or) to subvert the state's traditional interest inprotecting innocent human life, and withdraw the ability of thestate to protect vulnerable minors when they adopted the 1980Florida right of privacy,'' Bopp said.   A ruling by the seven justices could be weeks away as the courtbegins its annual vacation period next month. The court's decisioncould affect thousands of unmarried pregnant teens and possibly seta broad precedent, attorneys said.   Similar privacy issues dominate a case pending before the U.S.Supreme Court and the original 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision givingwomen the right to have abortions.   Before Florida's parental consent law was declaredunconstitutional, 60 teen-agers received judicial permission for anabortion.</TEXT></DOC>
