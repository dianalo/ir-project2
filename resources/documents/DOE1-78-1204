However, only recently through the efforts ofthe Seismic Design Margins Program, have they had the tools to effectivelyand efficiently quantify the inherent overall seismic capability of nuclearpower plants, and to do so in a way that can be used directly for licensingdecisions. The successful completion of the Maine Yankee seismic marginsreview in March 1987, and the issuance of a NNR Safety Evaluation Reportbased on this review are major milestones in the seismic evaluation ofnuclear power plants. The Seismic Design Margins Program (SDMP) developeda new seismic evaluation methodology to better evaluate the ability ofnuclear plants to withstand earthquakes above their design basis level.The approach involves the screening of components based on their importanceto safety and their seismic capacity. The products of a margins revieware High Confidence of Low Probability of Failure (HCLPF) capacitiesfor components, accident sequences and the plant. The HCLPF value isa lower bound estimate of seismic strength that explicitly considersthe confidence in this estimate. Systems analysis is used to determinethose plant systems and components that are important contributors toseismic core melt. The paper discusses how the methodology was used inthe Maine Yankee review. Ongoing and future SDMP tasks are also mentioned.</TEXT></DOC>
