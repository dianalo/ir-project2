The plan, White House sources said, will require the U.S. government to commit as much as $500 million in each of the next five fiscal years to such programs as &quot;clean&quot; coal-burning power plants. The actual spending will depend on the number of projects undertaken in the private sector and on matching funds available from industry.    The potential $500 million annual commitment marks an increase from the administration's budget proposal for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, which provides $287 million for programs related to acid rain.    If the administration makes available the full amount allowed in the new plan, it would follow more closely an agreement reached in Washington last March between Canada and the U.S. In that agreement, President Reagan and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney endorsed a special envoys' report calling for a $5 billion, five-year acid rain control program to be shared by the two countries.    The Reagan administration has been under pressure from Canada to honor its commitment to that report. Mr. Mulroney, who faces political difficulties at home, publicly chided Vice President Bush during a state visit to Ottawa in January.    The White House hopes the new plan will meet with Canadian approval, avoiding political embarrassment when President Reagan meets with Mr. Mulroney in Ottawa April 5 and 6. </TEXT></DOC>
