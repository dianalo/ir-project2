It's true that the modern presidential campaign spends much of its effort on stuff that will play on the evening news shows. And that neither the public nor the candidates are transfixed by things that some worriers lie awake with -- the federal deficit, higher taxes, Iran-Contra, the homeless, becoming a debtor nation and other quixotic issues of our time.    Yet the fact is that the Bush candidacy has attached itself to concrete ideas: no tax increase (read his lips), a cut in the capital-gains tax to 15% (more injections of Reaganomics), bringing the Russians to the negotiating table with a policy of unapologetic assertiveness, extending the Reagan legacy in defense and foreign policy, a child-care bill targeted at poor people, a &quot;move to the right&quot; with conservative running mate Dan Quayle.    On the Issues issue, however, Mr. Dukakis is in some ways the more interesting case -- the case of the Other Shoe That Never Drops.    Governor Dukakis, for example, spends a lot of time running against Manuel Noriega. He seems to think that the Panamanian villain is the key to banishing drugs from American streets. Yet every time he invokes &quot;Noreiga,&quot; the body politic leans forward in its seat to hear what President Mike Dukakis would do. Invade Panama? Send the Massachusetts National Guard? Charter a CIA assassin? The alternative never comes. The other shoe never drops.    In a long Labor Day speech, Mr. Dukakis didn't cite a single concrete thing he'd do as President. The Governor said: &quot;Look in the mirror and ask yourself, can we afford four more years of that?&quot; As opposed to what? The answer never came.    The middle class, said Mr. Dukakis, has worked harder during the Reagan years just to stay in place. This is indeed a grand theme, suggesting a virtual breakdown of the U.S. economy. What does Mr. Dukakis propose to do about it? Jawbone the Fed? Enact a floor under wages? Comparable worth legislation? On the economy, perhaps the central issue of any presidential campaign, Mr. Dukakis's other shoe never drops.    No one disputes the candidate's intelligence. He even taught at the Kennedy School. So what's the problem? Why the reticence?    Mr. Dukakis has a dilemma, and it's a familiar one. If he promises the general electorate the same things he promised left-to-liberal voters in the Democratic dwarf primaries, he'll never get 51% of the vote. So what he promises the general electorate is little more than nothing.    He's for long-term health care. But will he say now that he's for the multibillion-dollar Pepper bill?    He's for child care. But will he now put his John Hancock on the Dodd-Kildee bill, which would require public licensure and regulation of participating centers and most likely turn child care into a costly middle-class entitlement?    The fact is that below the murky surface of nearly all Mr. Dukakis's phrases hangs a specific legislative proposal in the Democratic-controlled Congress or a policy implication that is well understood by politicians, reporters and anyone else who pays attention to national politics. &quot;Good jobs at good wages&quot; and &quot;economic patriotism,&quot; for instance, clearly suggest targeted subsidies, import protection and federal bailouts. The Senate yesterday moved toward a vote on a textile bill that would severely restrict imports, and effectively guarantee textile workers &quot;good wages&quot; by propping up clothing prices. Would the Governor veto it or sign it?    Mr. Dukakis has just rehabilitated John Sasso to energize his floundering campaign, to sharpen the attack on George Bush, and to keep the reporters from falling asleep. We doubt that Mr. Sasso has any ideas on governing the United States that haven't occurred to Susan Estrich, Paul Brountas, Larry Summers or the candidate himself.    The real danger in running a presidential campaign like Mr. Dukakis's, which conceals his ideas on governing from the voters, is that even if he wins, the candidate enters office with no mandate. A President without an electoral mandate is a President the modern Congress will weaken and if possible, destroy. A President without a mandate cannot govern, and the nation loses.    At this stage, George Bush is running on the clearer mandate. For his part, Michael Dukakis asks: &quot;Can't we do better than that?&quot; About 90 million voters are waiting for the Governor's answer. </TEXT></DOC>
