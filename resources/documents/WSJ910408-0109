It's true that federal convictions of racist &quot;skinhead&quot;muggers, cross-burners and gay-bashers are on the rise. Butpast Justice Department policies and some recent decisionscast doubt on Mr. Thornburgh's periodic sermons on tolerationand equality.   At last week's news conference, for instance, JusticeDepartment officials didn't note for the assembled reportersand television cameras that the department could have begungathering statistics on hate crimes years ago but that itacted only after Congress ordered such data collection. Onereason the department hesitated in the 1980s was that itdidn't want to be linked to the gay and lesbian organizationsthat helped lead the fight for gathering hate-crimeinformation.   Congress ordered collection of hate-crime statistics lastyear, after years of pressure from anti-bias groups of allsorts. The figures will help officials discern the level andnature of criminal bigotry and pinpoint regions andorganizations for federal investigation.   When asked why the department had waited until Congressforced the matter, senior officials retreated tobureaucratese. Without last year's legislation, &quot;we would nothave had . . . the authority to require state and localagencies to provide that kind of information,&quot; said JamesTurner, deputy assistant attorney general for civil rights.To be fair, Mr. Turner, a career civil servant, had been sentout to read a statement from Mr. Thornburgh when the attorneygeneral canceled because of &quot;a scheduling problem.&quot;   Kevin Berrill, a crusader against anti-gay violence,praised the Justice Department's new enthusiasm on hatecrime. But he noted in an interview that some traditionalbiases within the department haven't changed. Mr. Berrillpointed out that the department lately has come to thedefense of a federal judge here who has been attacked forusing the term &quot;homo&quot; three times in court to describe ahomosexual plaintiff.   There are other examples of justice delayed. Mr. Sessionsannounced last week that he is &quot;considering&quot; disciplining 11FBI employees accused of harassing a black agent. The victim,Donald Rochon, agreed last year to drop a series of lawsuitsover the allegations in a settlement that guarantees him hissalary for the rest of his life. Mr. Rochon left the agency.The FBI didn't concede any wrongdoing.   Mr. Rochon's lawyer, Prof. David Kairys of TempleUniversity Law School, contended that his client firstcomplained about harassment eight years ago. When Mr.Thornburgh took office in 1988, the Justice Departmentstepped up its aggressive defense against Mr. Rochon,according to Mr. Kairys.   &quot;Top management was even more strongly behind theharassers, not the harassed&quot; under the Thornburgh-Sessionsregime, asserted Mr. Kairys. A separate 1988 lawsuit broughtby Hispanic agents successfully proved that the bureauengaged in a &quot;pattern&quot; of discriminatory employmentpractices. Mr. Sessions has defended the department'shardball legal tactics as legitimate and contended that, inresponse to court orders, the FBI has become anequal-opportunity employer.   But now a group of black agents has come forward tocomplain that they too routinely are passed over forpromotions. The black agents have lodged protests in unusualprivate talks with senior FBI officials; Mr. Sessions ispressing for an amicable settlement. The black agents havehired lawyers and are considering further legal actionagainst the FBI.</TEXT></DOC>
