On an 8-2 vote, with one commissioner abstaining, the commissionapproved Exxon's plans for the platforms, a marine terminal andonshore facility in Las Flores Canyon.   But the plan, which would more than double the state's oilproduction, requires major changes in Exxon's production methods.The company must dismantle an offshore treatment and storage shipnow in use, commission spokesman Jack Liebster said Tuesday.   ``We're talking about state-of-the-art air pollution control toreduce the current levels,'' he said. ``Even with the expansion,this will result in a reduction of emissions.''   A 1987 agreement on air pollution controls was instrumental inbreaking a political deadlock over Exxon's plan, commissionChairman Michael Wornum said.   The company is producing up to 40,000 barrels a day on PlatformHondo, located between coastal Santa Barbara County and the ChannelIslands. It processes the oil on an offshore vessel, a convertedoil tanker moored in federal waters 3.1 miles offshore.   In 1984 the oil company sued the commission, and later suedSanta Barbara County, over its demands that Exxon stop using theconverted tanker. In 1986 it renewed its lawsuit and issued anappeal to the Interior Department.   Commission approval was the result of compromises reached on allsides, including environmentalists, who agreed with Tuesday'sdecision, said Ralph Faust, another commission spokesman.   Following the vote, Terry C. Leftgoff, spokesman for theenvironmental group Get Oil Out, said the Exxon project is ``thebest that we could hope for in a regulatory environment.''</TEXT></DOC>
