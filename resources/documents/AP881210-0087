SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan got a clean bill of healthfrom his physicians today, who reported that lab tests of tissuetaken from his colon show him to be free of cancer, the White Housesaid.   ``The tissue removed Friday afternoon from President Reagan'scolon for biopsy is benign,'' said a statement issued bypresidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. ``No further examinationsor tests are required. The president is in excellent health.''   The statement added that the small amount of tissue taken fromthe president was ``a benign adenomatous polyp,'' a type of growththat is often found in men the president's age.   On Friday, first lady Nancy Reagan was told her latest breastX-ray showed ``no evidence of cancer of any kind.''   The couple, both of whom have battled cancer while in the WhiteHouse, spent more than four hours Friday at Bethesda Naval Hospitalfor annual physicals and cancer checkups.   Departing the hospital for the a weekend at Camp David., thepresident and his wife both smiled and gave ``thumbs-up'' signs.Reagan sported a pair of blue running shoes for tests that requiredhim to walk a treadmill. He called out, ``clean bill of health'' toreporters as he left the hospital.   Col. John Hutton, the president's physician, said doctors removeda ``small piece of tissue'' from Reagan's colon and that it``appeared to be benign,'' or non-cancerous.   The tissue, which was to be tested over the weekend, ``resembleda small adenomatous polyp'' and was ``removed because it wassuspicious,'' Hutton said.   There are several kinds of benign growths that can occur in thecolon, and they generally are divided into two types _ hyperplasticor adenomatous polyps. Hyperplastic polyps usually are not thoughtto be associated with cancers elsewhere in the colon, whileadenomatous polyps are a signal to be on guard for future growths.   Reagan's doctors have told him that he will need periodic colontests for the remainder of his life.   Hutton declared Reagan to be ``in excellent health ... inremarkable physical condition.''   The president has had polyps removed from his intestine in fourof five colonoscopic exams he has had since a two-inch cancerouslesion was removed from his colon in July 1985.   The relatively small polyps such as those taken in the past fromReagan tend to occur more frequently as people grow older. Thegrowths generally cause no serious symptoms but, if left alone, canbecome cancerous.   The colonoscopy was performed without sedation of any kind,Hutton said in a statement. The examination involves the use of along, flexible scope that is inserted into the bowel. If a polyp isfound, the physician can use a tiny wire loop at the end of thescope to snare the growth and clip it off. The wound is sealed withan electrical current that runs through the instrument.   The statement added that the president's chest X-ray was clear,that his urine sample was normal, and that there was ``no clinicallysignificant change'' in his pulmonary condition.   ``The stress test and electrocardiogram showed the president'scardiovascular system is unchanged and normal,'' it said.   Reagan's CAT-scan, the computerized three-dimensional X-ray ofhis internal organs, showed no internal abdominal abnormalities. Thetest checks against the spread of cancer to other vital organs inthat region of the body, such as the stomach or liver.   Mrs. Reagan, 67, had her second breast X-ray, or mammogram, sinceher cancerous left breast was removed in October 1987. Hutton saidthe exam ``showed no evidence of cancer of any kind. Physicalexamination showed her condition was normal.''   Earlier Friday, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater saidReagan has received a positive report from his dermatologists, whoexamined him at the White House on Thursday and pronounced him freeof any new skin cancers.   Reagan had skin cancers removed from his face in August 1985 andJuly 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
