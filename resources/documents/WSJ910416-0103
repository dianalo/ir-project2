The Dayton, Ohio, company had net income of $46 million,or 70 cents a share, after a charge of $7 million, or sixcents a share, for costs related to ATandamp;T's bid. Last year'sfirst-quarter net was $52 million, or 73 cents a share, on 7%more shares outstanding.</LP><TEXT>   Revenue climbed 8% to $1.37 billion. While much of thegrowth resulted from favorable currency conversions oninternational sales, revenue was still well ahead of mostanalysts' estimates.   &quot;To show any growth at all in the current environment is asurprise and will strengthen NCR's hand somewhat againstATandamp;T,&quot; said Steven Milunovich, an analyst with SalomonBrothers. &quot;It lends credibility to their stance that NCR isworth more than ATandamp;T is offering.&quot; The telecommunicationsconcern has offered to pay $100 a share, or $6.8 billion, ifa friendly transaction can be concluded.   Separately, NCR said that ATandamp;T's effort to remove the NCRboard at last month's annual meeting was backed by 52% ofshares outstanding, less than the 60% that had been forecastand well short of the 80% required to oust the entire board.But NCR also acknowledged that ATandamp;T's proxy campaignsucceeded -- by a vote of 75% -- in ousting four directorsfrom the board, including NCR's chairman and chief executiveofficer, Charles E. Exley Jr., and President GilbertWilliamson.   NCR isn't expected to seat ATandamp;T's four directors untilMay, and has said the board may vote to reinstate the ousteddirectors by increasing the board's size from its current 12members. However, the four reinstated directors would berequired to stand for election again next year -- in additionto the five directors who would stand for re-election in 1992under NCR's staggered board structure.   NCR shares fell in active trading yesterday to close at$96.625 a share, down 37.5 cents a share in composite NewYork Stock Exchange trading. The shares surrendered theirgains from Friday, when traders bet that merger talks mightresume over the weekend after the two companies asked aDayton federal judge to extend a 10-day moratorium onlitigation between the two companies.   But both sides indicated that the moratorium was arelatively narrow one, pertaining only to the production ofdocuments, and wouldn't change the overall timetable for thecourt cases. Apparently, no progress was made over theweekend.   In its case, ATandamp;T is seeking to force NCR to drop itspoison-pill anti-takeover defense, which would make a hostiletakeover prohibitively expensive. NCR, in a separate suit,has raised antitrust questions about the bid. The trial inthe more significant poison-pill case remains set to begin inJune.   The 52% proxy vote in favor of ATandamp;T's proposal to oust theboard was a disappointment for ATandamp;T, particularly because thecompany's own proxy solicitor had said that ATandamp;T might beable to gain 80% of the vote. But the ATandamp;T side stressed thatthe lower percentage was due to a low turnout, noting thatATandamp;T still got 78% of the votes cast, while NCR got 22%. Thelow vote could marginally weaken ATandamp;T's legal argument thatNCR should be forced to drop its poison pill, since it's lessof an overwhelming shareholder mandate.   ATandamp;T Chairman Robert E. Allen expressed disappointmentthat shareholders vote fell short of ousting NCR's entireboard. But he added: &quot;We are pleased that our four nomineeswere elected to the board by more than a three-to-onemargin.&quot;   In a statement, NCR's Mr. Exley said that NCR's earningswere helped by strong overseas sales, particularly in thePacific Rim, which offset continued weak sales in the U.S. Hewarned that the stronger dollar will dampen 1991 results butadded that &quot;we continue to project modest growth in revenueand net income for the year.&quot;   &quot;They were clearly bailed out by overseas results,&quot; saidJay Stevens, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., whohad expected much weaker numbers after the bigdisappointments dished up by IBM and Apple Computer Inc. Healso applauded apparently strong orders for automated tellermachines and a new line of personal computers.   NCR is expected today to introduce a new line ofdocument-imaging products, systems which store and processcomputerized images of documents such as checks or insuranceforms.</TEXT></DOC>
