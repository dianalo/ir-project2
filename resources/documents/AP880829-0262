The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is reported tobe producing about 20 million barrels of oil a day this month, some3.5 million barrels a day over its overall production quota,keeping prices weak.   Subroto, Indonesia's former Energy Minister, flew in from Kuwaiton the sixth leg of a tour of oil-producing countries and waswelcomed by Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh, Iran'sofficial Islamic Republic News Agency reported.   Subroto's talks will be vital to OPEC efforts to imposeproduction discipline among its 13-member nations, officials said.   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Subroto as urging all OPECproducers to adhere to their output quotas. The news agency saidSubroto declined comment on current OPEC production levels.   Subroto was expected to ask the Iranians to agree to allow Iraq,their enemy in the Persian Gulf war, a quota equal to Iran's 2.36million barrels a day.   Iraq, which began talks with Iran recently over ending the8-year-old war, has refused to accept an OPEC quota of 1.5 millionbarrels a day, about half its current estimated production.   The Middle East Economic Survey, a respected oil industrynewsletter published in Nicosia, said OPEC's August output, about3.5 million barrels a day over its overall production quota, waskeeping oil prices weak.   OPEC's official price is $18 a barrel. But the weekly noted thatBritain's benchmark Brent crude was selling at around $15 a barrel,with gulf crude selling around $1.50 a barrel below that.   ``Even assuming, as may well be the case, that demand is runningat a substantially higher level than projected by most forecasts,such a production volume is clearly too high for comfort on theprice front,'' the newsletter said.   The main violator of OPEC's quota agreement has been the UnitedArab Emirates. It has rejected its quota of 948,000 barrels a dayand is producing an estimated 1.5 million barrels a day.   Iraq currently produces an estimated 3 million barrels a day.That includes 300,000 barrels a day provided by Saudi Arabia andKuwait, Iraq's allies in the gulf war, to help sustain itswar-battered economy.   That earns Baghdad, Iraq's capital, around $12 billion a year.   Hopes that Iraq might agree to a quota were raised last monthwhen Tehran unconditionally accepted a United Nations cease-firecall. The truce took effect Aug.20.   But both Iran and Iraq badly need to boost oil revenues to payfor the massive task of reconstruction. Oil industry sourcesbelieve they both may be tempted to produce as much as they can getaway with.   Before the war broke out in September 1980, Iranian productionwas around 4 million barrels a day and had reached a peak of 6million barrels a day during the reign of the late Shah MohammedReza Pahlavi.   Baghdad has an estimated $85 billion in debt because of the warand badly needs to boost its oil revenues.   Iran is in better financial shape, with estimated foreignreserves of $5 billion still intact and debts of only a few billiondollars.   But its oil revenues have slumped in the last few years during afierce Iraqi campaign to throttle its oil exports.   Tehran earned around $12.5 billion from oil in 1984, but lastyear's revenues were estimated at $9 billion, Western oil sourceshave said.   Iran's deputy oil minister, Kazempour Ardebili, last weekindicated that Tehran rejects giving Iraq production parity underOPEC's quota system.   The Iranians have insisted that Iraq be forced to accept thelower quota, arguing that Iran's 50 million population is threetimes that of Iraq.   The Kuwaiti News Agency Monday quoted unidentified oil sourcesas saying that Subroto might suggest increasing Iran's quota toaround 2.5 million barrels a day in an effort to woo Tehran.   Subroto was expected to go on to Baghdad, Iraq's capital,Wednesday.</TEXT></DOC>
