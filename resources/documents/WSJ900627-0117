Thatwas good news for bond investors because a successfuldeficit-reduction package could cut the government'sborrowing needs, thereby easing some of the upward pressureon interest rates.   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan hasindicated a willingness to ease interest rates if Congressand the administration can act swiftly to cut the deficit.   Bond traders said most of the action came from dealers whohad sold borrowed bonds, betting on further price declines,then rushed to buy them back after Mr. Bush's comments.Prices began drifting lower as traders pondered, with someconfusion, what kind of taxes the Bush administration iswilling to raise.   Stock prices exploded at the opening bell, and the DowJones industrials were up as much as 30 points by 10:15 a.m.Ben Capaldi, a partner at Brandywine Asset Management,Wilmington, Del., said that while Mr. Bush's remarks &quot;gotpeople excited earlier in the day,&quot; the euphoria cooled asinvestors realized no details were mentioned and thatpoliticians could still flub the opportunity to cut thedeficit.   The dollar fell because traders think higher taxes wouldweaken the U.S. economy and cause the Fed to ease interestrates. Such a step would make the dollar less attractive thansome other major currencies.   In major market action:                                                                                                          Stock prices edged lower on volume of 141.4 million sharesin New York Stock Exchange trading.
