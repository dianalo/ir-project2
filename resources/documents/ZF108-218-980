Swanstrom,chief economist for Sears, Roebuck, a retail and financial services companybased in Chicago.andM;&quot;Until just recently, we were on the precipice of a recession,&quot; said AdrianDillon, chief economist at Eaton, a manufacturer of vehicle capital goodsbased in Cleveland.andM;But although the economy flirted with a downturn, the general prognosis isthat the economy will remain flat through most of this year and that mostcorporations will trim their capital budgets to reflect this reality.andM;According to a DR poll of 300 small, medium and large VAX sites, more than 50percent of the respondents who plan to increase their hardware spending thisyear said their plans include acquiring a workstation or personal computer.andO;More than one-third of those respondents also said they intend to purchaseminicomputer-class systems, possibly reflecting those systems' evolving roleas file servers for workstations and PCs.andP;  (See &quot;Planned hardware purchasesin 1990,&quot; below, and &quot;Hardware purchasing plans of companies with increasedbudgets,&quot; page 35.)andM;Customer emphasis in the computer industry on lower-cost platforms directlyreflects most economists' comments about the economy in general.andM;Sears, Roebuck's Swanstrom is predicting a 2.3 percent increase in real grossnational product (GNP) in the first half of 1990, with a 3 percent increasein the second half.andM;Although Swanstrom's prediction is about 1 percent higher than the consensusamong economists, few are predicting a recession.andP;  &quot;The fact that recessionwas not mentioned by most other economists is very significant,&quot; Eaton'sDillion said.andM;NEGLIGIBLE INFLATION RATEandM;The reason economists are more bullish about the second half of 1990 is thatmost of them are expecting the Federal Reserve Board to have lowered interestrates sufficiently by the middle of this year to stimulate the economy.andM;Any rise in inflation is expected to hover around 4 percent this year,compared with 4.6 percent last year.andP;  In fact, Eaton's Dillon went so far asto say, &quot;There will be no inflation in the industrial sector.andP;  Productivitygains will be sufficient to overcome any rise in labor costs.&quot;andM;With few signs of inflation putting pressure on the economy, the FederalReserve Board should feel comfortable with lowering interest rates tostimulate growth.andM;In general, expectations of lower interest rates are arrived at througheducated reasoning mixed with an equal part of tempered optimism.andP;  A primaryfactor supporting that outlook is that the Japanese Central Bank will beleaning on the Federal Reserve Board to lower interest rates, making the U.S.andO;dollar less attractive to foreign investors.andP;  The benefit to the Japanesewould be a more stable yen; the benefit to the United States would be lowerinterests rates, which would stimulate the economy.andM;&quot;Just exercise caution in the first half [of the year] and wait to see whatis going on,&quot; advised Tom McBride, a vice president with Ingersoll-Rand, amanufacturing company in Woodcliff Lake, N.J.andM;But getting a roomful of economists to agree on something is like getting theOpen Software Foundation and Unix International to agree on standards.andP;  Onediscordant voice saying the economy is already in a tailspin belongs toCharles Taylor, formerly an economist with Prudential-Bache and now anindependent consultant in Washington, D.C.andM;&quot;We are in a recession right now,&quot; Taylor said.andP;  He points to the highpersonal savings rate, saying it has gone up much too quickly.andP;  This speedysocking away of our money, he said, indicates a loss of consumer confidence.andO;In fact, Taylor is downright bearish, saying that not only are weexperiencing a recession, but that it &quot;will last right through the beginningof 1991.&quot;andM;Yet the current consensus is that the economy is in for a period ofrelatively modest growth.andP;  So if most industry leaders and economists areexpecting no recession this year and inflation stays under control, whatcould be wrong with this economic picture?andM;In 1990, the rate of total capital expenditures in the United States will bedown significantly from 1989.andP;  According to the Census Bureau at the U.S.andO;Department of Commerce, the latest estimate of 1990 capital spending is $505billion.andP;  This is 6.4 percent more than was spent last year.andP;  But in terms ofpercentage growth, the 1990 rate is nearly 4 percent less than last year'srate, when capital spending growth was 10.3 percent higher than in 1988.andM;To pose our question another way, how do you support a high-growth, high-techindustry with a lowered capital spending rate?andP;  The answer is, You don't.andO;This is why the Commerce Department also predicts that 5,000 fewer peoplewill be working in the computer industry by the end of this year.andM;David Wyss, senior vice president and chief financial economists forDRI/McGRaw Hill, in Lexington, Mass., expects a 10 percent drop in computerprices in 1990 but only a 5 percent increase in unit volume growth.andP;  All inall, he concludes, &quot;This means no growth for the industry in 1990.&quot;andM;Not even exports to Europe or Japan are expected to make a significant dentin that prognosis.andP;  This year, Western Europe's economy is expected to growas much as 3.5 percent, compared with slightly more than 2 percent in theUnited States.andM;Even though the European picture is brighter than that of the United States,the economy in Europe is slowing down as well.andP;  The United Kingdom and othersare starting to lay on higher interest rates, which could spell bad news formany of our high-tech vendors.andP;  Some companies operating overseas earn asmuch as half of their revenues from sales in Western Europe.andP;  DEC itself hasbeen a major beneficiary of the booming European economy.andM;So why is the European Economic Community slowing down when 1992 is still acouple of years away?andP;  Because &quot;1992 is a non-event,&quot; Eaton's Dillon said.andM;The apparently imminent reunification of East Germany and West Germany willlikely shove back the economic plans for 1992 by a few years.andP;  A unifiedGermany will create the largest market in Europe, and it will have ties tothe East as well as to the West.andP;  Because of this twist in European politics,companies that are not already in the European market may have a few moreyears to develop their base before a joint European economy, in whateverform, takes shape.andM;THINKING JAPANESEandM;Japan's economy is expected to be weak in the first half of the year but muchstronger in the second half.andP;  On average, the predictions are that Japan willhave an annual GNP growth rate of about 4.5 percent.andM;But this year, as in other years, the Japanese market offers something of amixed bag for the U.S.andP;  high-tech industry.andM;Japan's recent emphasis on stimulating its home economy could be good news,especially for U.S.andP;  companies selling computer systems.andP;  &quot;Japan will have 8to 10 percent growth in capital investment, with a significant contributioncoming from information systems,&quot; Eaton's Dillon said.andM;Oddly enough, Japanese spending on information systems (IS) well be a directresult of the country's being underautomated.andP;  &quot;If you walk into a Japanesebank or insurance company, you will see far fewer terminals and PCs than inthe West,&quot; said Robert Brusca, an economist with Nikko Securities, a New Yorkinvestment banking company.andM;One technical reason for this paucity of PCs is that in the home market, theJapanese aren't seeking the Holy Grail of standardized, open systemsInternecine crusades between NEC (the biggest IS supplier in Japan) and itscompetitors have led to tremendous product fragmentation.andP;  For example, thereare several versions of MS-DOS.andP;  Obviously, this lack of standardization atthe most basic level of corporate computing would thwart anybody's automationplans.andM;But regardless of this lack of standards, it appears that Japan is about tooutspend the United States in office automation.andP;  The reason, Brusca said, isthat &quot;in contrast to the United States, Japanese office automation will [meanoffsetting' its low unemployment.andP;  It has an aging labor force, with notenough people to fuel its expanding economy.&quot;andM;This heavy spending could translate into stronger earnings for some U.S.andO;vendors.andP;  In fact, DEC and other U.S.andP;  system companies are already showingsome increases in revenues from Japanese operations.andM;But whether gains in the Japanese market will offset a major downturn inEurope is questionable.andP;  Unlike Europe, Japan has many strong indigenous ISvendors and a much more convoluted product-distribution system, which tend togive Japanese vendors the home-court advantage.andM;In addition, IS managers in the United States could see their companiesbecome less interested in making large capital investments because the returnon those investments will never equal the ROI a Japanese competitor wouldenjoy.andM;Today Japan's strength is cost of capital, said George Hatsopoulos, who, inaddition to being chief executive officer of Waltham, Mass-based ThermoElectron, also serves as vice chairman of the American Business Conference.andM;&quot;The extremely low cost of capital in Japan is the most critical element intheir global competitiveness.andP;  This is in contrast to five to 10 years ago,when the key factor was labor costs,&quot; Hatsopoulos said.andP;  (See &quot;The cost ofcapital: esoteric term or essential means of comparison?&quot; on page 36).andM;So given a sluggish U.S.andP;  economy, a tight export market and increasedconcerns over the cost of capital, IS executives can expect their budgetallocation to remain flat.andM;The most significant trend in 1990 will be system upgrades and purchases oflow-end systems rather than new big-ticket systems.andM;According to the DR poll, the greatest percentage of system acquisition willcome from small-to medium-VAX sites, with the larger companies pulling in thereins on computer expenditures.andM;The survey found that 54 percent of the managers at small companies will havea larger MIS budget this year, compared with 60 percent of managers atmedium-sized organizations.andP;  (See &quot;Change in MIS capital budget since lastyear,&quot; page 35.)andM;Only 12 percent of the medium-sized companies and 14 percent of the smallcompanies have cut back their budgets.andP;  But at the large companies, 26percent of the respondents said they will be spending less money this yearthan they did last year.andM;Although the same small companies are spending more, it is doubtful thattheir budgets will make up for sales lost through tightened belts at thelargest companies.andP;  The median budget for the small companies hovers around$191,000--loss than the price of a midlevel VAX.andP;  (See &quot;Fiscal year 1990 MISbudget,&quot; page 35.)andM;Medium-sized organizations plant to spend proportionally more.andP;  Their medianbudget is about $475,000, higher than the $417,000 average for largercompanies.andM;The DR survey also shows that 42 percent of MIS managers at companiesearnings less than $15 million in revenues are optimistic about the economythis year, and so are a quarter of the MIS managers at companies in the $15million to $75 million bracket.andP;  (See &quot;Companies' attitudes about theeconomy,&quot; page 35.)andM;However, MIS managers at companies with more than $75 million in revenues arepredicting a gloomier future.andP;  Only 26 percent of these respondents are happyabout this year's economic prospects; 62 percent said they are cautions.andM;TARGET SPENDINGandM;The target for vendors this year is clear: Medium-sized companies have themoney to spend.andP;  But the unanswered question is, what are buyers from samlland large companies looking for?andM;The big winners in DR's poll are workstations and PCs with minicomputer-classsystems coming in a close third.andP;  Peripherals are also much sought after bycompanies in the $15 million to $75 million range.andM;On the average, about 22 percent of the respondents, at all three incomelevels, plan to purchase a midrange computer this year.andP;  The poll indicatesthat many of these machines will come from DEC.andP;  In the case of the largecompanies, a full 78 percent plan to buy these systems from DEC, with Sunrunning second.andP;  (See &quot;Planned source of systems hardware,&quot; page 34.)andM;Sun systems are being sought by all three income categories of VAXsites--almost 30 percent of all respondents plan to purchase Sun equipmentthis year.andM;In software, one of the biggest areas of growth will be office automation.andO;(See &quot;Planned 1990 software expenditures,&quot; page 34.)andM;&quot;A real switch is that service companies are becoming more capital-intensivethrough automation, as opposed to labor-intensive,&quot; said Gordon Richards,assistant vice president and director of economic policy at the NationalAssociation of Manufacturers.andM;Ingersoll-Rand's McBride advises, &quot;Companies that want to increaseproductivity through automation must have a three- to five-year plan.andP;  It isvery important to have the patience to get past the learning curve with newsystems.&quot;andM;Dr.andP;  Walter Robb, senior vice president of research and development atGeneral Electric in Schenectady, N.Y., added that although his companyhsfive-year plans show productivity gains, those gains &quot;are usually less thanoriginally projected.&quot;andM;&quot;As you increase capability, designs become more complex, reducing theexpected productivity gains.andP;  Normally, though, this is offset by the factthat  you get a better product,&quot; he added.andM;The medium-sized comparison in the DR poll expressed the highest interest inoffice automation, with 44 percent expecting to purchase automation softwarein the next year.andP;  Database management software rivaled office automation inthis group.andM;But one clear emphasis of all groups included in the DR survey is networking,with an average of 41 percent from the three groups saying they intend toinvest heavily in networking.andP;  (See &quot;Network hardware and softwareexpenditures since last year&quot; and &quot;Planned network equipment purchases,&quot; page35.)andM;In the average home, when money gets tight, the family spends less and triesto make do.andP;  So it is in corporate America, where making do means gettingmore out of existing systems through networking and acquiring smaller-scalesystems offering better price/performance.andM;THE COST OF CAPITAL: ESTOERIC TERM OR ESSENTIAL MEANS OF COMPARISON?andM;So here you are chief IS officer in a world-class company, banging heads withJapan Inc. in your market segment.andP;  Your goal is to improve your company'sability to complete through automation.andP;  These new systems will help yourcompany build products with zero defects, institute just-in-time inventorycontrol, do flexible manufacturing, create capabilities for rapid customerresponse, and do more research and development.andM;In other words, you are going to use these new systems to beat Japan Inc. atits own game.andP;  The trouble is, after doing everything to modernize yourcompany's operations, you still may lose through no fault of your own.andM;Even when the playing field is leveled in all these areas, Japan Inc. maystill have one enormous advantage over any U.S.andP;  company.andP;  This strength is&quot;cost of capital,&quot; said George Hatsopoulos, chief executive officer of ThermoElectron, a manufacturing company in Waltham, Mass.andP;  Hatsopoulos is also vicechairman of the American Business Conference (ABC).andM;&quot;In the United States, you have to earn more than 12 percent after taxes onyour capital investments just to be considered respectable,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Butin Japan, if you [earn] more than 5 percent, you are considered a starperformer.&quot;andM;&quot;For years, the Japanese government subsidized its industry with low interestrates.andP;  It was a strategic obje ctive of the government,&quot; explained TomMcBride, a vice president of Ingersoll-Rand, a manufacturing company inWoodcliff Lake, N.J.andM;Two key items drive down the cost of capital in Japan relative to the UnitedStates, according to Robert Brusca, an economist with Nikko Securities, a NewYork investment banking company.andM;First is the difference in price/earnings (P/E) ratios between U.S.andO;corporate stocks and their Japanese counterparts.andP;  In the United States, theaverage P/E is 14, which means that the price per share divided by theearnings per share is equal to 14.andP;  In Japan, investors are willing to pay anaverage P/E of 60.andP;  This pumps a tremendous amount of savings into theJapanese stock market, and these investors are looking primarily for stockappreciation, not cash dividends.andP;  Generally speaking, very few Japanesecorporations pay out quarterly dividends, so they can stockpile retainedearnings without worrying about stockholder pressure.andP;  This situation gives aJapanese executive a much different perspective than his American counterpartwhen planning long-term capital formation and spending.andM;Second is the cost of capital after taxes.andP;  In Japan, if you make a killingin the stock market, the tax on your capital gains is very low.andP;  It is either1 percent of the gross amount, or 26 percent of your profit over the originalinvestment.andP;  This is a very flexible arrangement.andP;  By contrast, the UnitedStates has legislated out of existence all favorable tax rates on capitalgains.andP;  The United States also did away with the investment tax credit (ITC).andM;Did the country shoot itself in the capital-spending foot with these twocongressional actions?andP;  The econometric model developed by Gordon Richards,assistant vice president and director of economic policy for the NationalAssociation of Manufacturers, finds this to be the case.andP;  In the model,Richards says the elimination of the ITC alone has caused a cumulative lossof $72 billion in capital spending.andP;  &quot;Many investments do not pass muster inthe United States because the cost of capital requirements is so high,&quot;agreed Thomas E. Swanstrom, chief economist at Sears, Roebuck.andM;Supporting the conclusion that Japan enjoys a significant edge in attractingcapital is data from a recent Quarterly Review published by the FederalReserve Bank of New York that highlights relative percentage differences inthe cost of capital between the United States and Japan.andP;  (See &quot;Cost ofcapital: Japn vs.andP;  U.S.,&quot; above.)andM;One area that sticks out like a sore thumb is that of Randamp;D projects with a10-year payoff.andP;  The Japanese have a better than 2-to-1 advantage over theirU.S.andP;  counterparts in this critical area.andP;  For long-term capital equipmentlasting 20 years, the Japanese enjoy an advantage of 34 percent to 36percent.andM;Even when looking at three-year expensed items, a Japanese business stillpays as much as 14 percent less for capital than a comparable U.S.andP;  company.andM;Though just about everyone concedes Japan became a major industrial power bypromoting a lower cost of capital--which it accomplished by keeping a lid oninterest rates and channeling savings into its stock market--not everyoneagrees Japan will be able to maintain this largess over the long haul.andM;Proponents of the &quot;mobile capital equalizes cost&quot; (MCEC) theory argue thataccess to capital is becoming international, giving all nations a levelplaying field on which to compete for capital.andM;In the first half of the 1980s, the Japanese gradually began to relaxcontrols on foreign capital investment.andP;  As a result of these loosenedcontrols, Japanese companies and financial institutions are now aggresivelyinvesting and competing in global markets.andM;&quot;A global market begets global financing.andP;  This, in turn, tends to level outthe cost of capital advantage,&quot; Ingersoll-Rand's McBride said.andM;In other words, there is a large pool of yen, Euroyen and other currenciesmoving about the world.andP;  As a result of the yen's globetrotting and capitalmarkets' intermixing, MCEC advocates contend that interest-rate differencesbetween countries will start to lessen.andM;&quot;Global markets and mobile yen will even things out between the U.S.andP;  andJapan, and that includes the differences in cost of capital.andP;  Cost of capitalshould not be a handicap going into 1990,&quot; said Adrian Dillon, chiefeconomist of Eaton, a $3.7 billion diversified manufacturer of vehicle andcapital goods based in Cleveland.andM;But some at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York would vehemently disagreethat MCEC theories will diminish Japan Inc.'s competitive edge over U.S.andO;companies.andM;Followers of MCEC are full of &quot;globaloney,&quot; said Robert McCauley, a senioreconomist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.andP;  McCauley said there willalways be certain fundamental econimic differences between Japan and theUnited States that will prevent the global economic playing field from everbeing truly level.andM;One example of a fundamental economic discrepancy between the two countriesis the value of real estate: The law of supply and demand has given the realestate of the entire continental United States a lower value than the islandof Japan.andP;  Another significant difference between the two nations is theincredibly high savings rate in Japan when compared with the U.S.andP;  rate.andM;In the context of who has cheaper costs of capital, such deep social andhistorical discrepancies would indicate that Japan has, and will keep,certain kinds of economic advantages over the United States, McCauley argued.andM;He added that subscribers to MCEC theories may believe they can get astrategic edge by seeking capital from Japanese investors.andM;But according to McCauley, the fluctuation in currency exchange rates canmore than wipe out such expected gains.andP;  And to expect that you can hedgeyour bets by playing the future options game during the course of a 10- or20-year payback is simply unrealistic.andP;  What you will pay in premiums forthese options will more than cancel out any potential savings, he said.andM;Nikko Securities' Brusca concurred that the relative cost of capital is notthe only criteria for assessing a potential competitive advantage.andP;  forexample, Brusca said, &quot;In the United States, we have accelerateddepreciation.andP;  In Japan, they can only depreciate [longer] with straightline.&quot;andM;Brusca added that there are other, more important issues than just the costof capital; for example, the expected rate of technological change, thetraining for new automated systems and the cost of software development.andM;Brusca did concede, however, that Japan &quot;does have a bit of a cost-of-capitaladvantage, but not enough to get worked up about.&quot;andM;In the end, though, as will all economic theories, debates over the cost ofcapital remain &quot;a contentious issue where not everybody agrees,&quot; Eaton'sDillon said.andM;Despite disagreements, the only salvation for industrial America may be insimply working harder and smarter.andM;As Thermo Electron's Hatsopoulos said, U.S.andP;  companies will need to be &quot;veryaggressive, have long-term horizons and compete in specialized niches.&quot;andM;Franco Vitaliano is president of VXM Technologies, a Boston-based provider ofsoftware to create self-adaptive networked supercomputers.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
