Background</ITAG>On July 3, 1985 (50 FR 27560), FAC 84-10, Item III, Certificate of CommercialPricing, was published as an interim rule implementing Pub. Laws 98-577(applicable to the civilian agencies) and 98-525 (applicable to DOD, NASA,and the Coast Guard) requiring that acquisitions of commercial items besubject to a certification regarding the lowest price charged the publicfor items. Subsequently, the FY '87 DoD Appropriations Act, Pub. L. 99-591,made changes to the statutory coverage applicable to DoD, NASA, and theCoast Guard. The FAR revisions included in this proposed rule implement Pub. Laws 98-577and 99-591 now codified at 41 U.S.C. 253e and 10 U.S.C. 2323, respectively,and are applicable to all agencies. Under the proposed coverage, offerors/contractorsin certain noncompetitive acquisitions are required to certify that theprices offered to the Government for spare or repair parts that the contractoralso offers for sale to the general public are no higher than the lowestcommercial price at which such parts were sold during the most recent regularperiod of not less than 30 days duration, or submit a written justificationof the difference. The final rule, which will be developed after considerationof the public comments received from this notice of proposed rule, willrescind the interim rule and the DFARS coverage published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on June 1, 1988 (53 FR 19960). <ITAG tagnum="84">B. Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>The proposed rule adds FAR 14.214, amends 15.813, revises the clause at52.215-32, and adds the clause at 52.215-35 to implement Pub. Laws 98-577and 99-591. Under the new coverage, offerors/contractors in certain noncompetitiveacquisitions are required to certify that the prices offered for spareor repair parts that the contractor offers for sale to the general publicare no higher than the lowest commercial price at which such parts weresold during the most recent regular monthly, quarterly, or other periodof not less than 30 days in duration for which sales data are reasonablyavailable. Such coverage is not expected to have a significant impact ona substantial number of small entities because the information requiredshould be readily available to small businesses since they are less likelyto have decentralized sales records and the large volume of sales transactionsnormally associated with larger businesses. However, an Initial RegulatoryFlexibility Analysis (IRFA) has been prepared and will be provided to theChief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration. A copyof the IRFA may be obtained from the FAR Secretariat. Comments are invitedfrom small businesses and other interested parties. Comments from smallentities concerning the affected FAR Subpart will also be considered inaccordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submittedseparately and cite FAR Case 88-610 in correspondence. <ITAG tagnum="84">C. Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The Paperwork Reduction Act (Pub. L. 96-511) is deemed to apply becausethe proposed rule contains information collection requirements. Accordingly,a request for approval of a new information collection requirement concerningCertification of Commercial Pricing is being submitted to the Office ofManagement and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq. Public comments concerningthis request will be invited through a subsequent <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 14, 15, and 52 </ITAG>Government procurement.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: November 14, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Harry S.

It implements the statutory provisions in 41 U.S.C.253e for civilian agencies and 10 U.S.C. 2323 for the Department of Defense,the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and Coast Guard.<ITAG tagnum="80">15.813-2 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions.</ITAG>``Lowest commercial price,'' as used in this section, means the lowestprice at which a sale was made to the general public of a particular partor component. The term does not include the price at which a sale was madeto_(a) Any agency of the United States;(b) Customers located outside the United States;(c) A subsidiary, affiliate, or parent business organization of the contractoror any other branch of the same business entity; and(d) For contracts awarded by the Department of Defense, the National Aeronauticsand Space Administration, and the Coast Guard, such term also does notinclude the sale to any customer_(1) For resale after such customer performs a service or function in connectionwith such part or component that increases the cost of the part or componentunless the agency procuring the part or component can demonstrate thatthe agency is procuring the part or component before such service or functionhas been performed by any such customer (see 15.813-6(c)); or(2) At a price that, for the purpose of making a donation, has been substantiallydiscounted below the fair market value or regular price of such part orcomponent.``Part or component,'' as used in this section, means_(a) For acquisitions of the Department of Defense, the National Aeronauticsand Space Administration, and the Coast Guard, any individual piece, part,subassembly, or component which is furnished for the logistic support orrepair of an end item and not as an end item itself; or(b) For acquisitions of civilian agencies other than the National Aeronauticsand Space Administration and the Coast Guard, any individual part, component,subassembly, assembly, or subsystem integral to a major system, and otherproperty which may be replaced during the service life of the system, andincludes spare parts and replenishment spare parts, but does not includepackaging or labeling associated with shipment or identification of a partor component. <ITAG tagnum="80">15.813-3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Policy.</ITAG>Contracts entered into using other than full and open competition may notresult in prices for parts or components (as defined in 15.813-2) offeredfor sale to the public that exceed the contractor's lowest commercial pricesfor such parts or components unless the price difference is clearly justifiedby the seller or the contracting officer has determined to exempt the contractorfrom the requirement under 15.813-5(d). To this end, 41 U.S.C. 253e and10 U.S.C. 2323 require offerors to certify that prices offered for partsor components are not more than their lowest commercial prices, or to submita written statement specifying the amount of the difference between theirlowest commercial prices for the parts or components and the prices offered,and providing justification for those differences. Because the forces ofthe competitive marketplace should ensure that the Government does notpay too high a price for commercial parts or components, commercial pricingcertificates are necessary only when these forces are not present in aparticular contract action. <ITAG tagnum="80">15.813-4</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Requirements for submission of commercial pricing certificates.</ITAG>Unless a contract is exempt from the requirement pursuant to 15.813-5,commercial pricing certificates are required to be submitted with any offer/proposalthat:(a) Includes any parts or components that are offered for sale to the public,and(b) Is submitted in connection with any of the following:(1) Offers/proposals in connection with contracts to be awarded withoutfull and open competition.(2) Contract modifications, including contract modifications for additionalparts or components, but not including contract modifications that arewithin the scope and under the terms of the contract, such as contractmodifications issued pursuant to the Changes clause (but see subparagraph(b)(5) of this subsection), or funding and other administrative modifications.(3) Orders under the provisioning line item of a contract, a basic orderingagreement, or similar arrangement if the order is being placed withoutfull and open competition.(4) Definitization of price on a letter contract, unpriced order, or othercontract, modification, or order awarded without a definitive price. (Thecommercial pricing certificate is not required before the initial award,but rather shall be submitted with the proposal to definitize.)(5) Any modification issued pursuant to the Changes clause that resultsin the providing of new or different parts or components. <ITAG tagnum="80">15.813-5 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Exemption from the requirement to submit commercial pricing certificates.</ITAG>A contract is exempt from the requirement that a commercial pricing certificatebe submitted if_(a) The simplified small purchase procedures of Part 13 are used; (b) An acquisition is being made under the procedures established by theGeneral Services Administration for its multiple award schedule program;or (c) An order is placed under an indefinite delivery type contract (a certificateis required in connection with the award without full and open competitionof an indefinite delivery type contract); or (d) The contracting officer determines that obtaining the commercial pricingcertificate is not appropriate because of_(1) National security considerations; or(2) Significant differences between the terms of the commercial sales ofthe parts or components to be acquired under the contract and the termsof the contract including differences in quantity, quality, delivery requirements,or other terms and conditions. <ITAG tagnum="80">15.813-6 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Procedures.</ITAG>(a) If a commercial pricing certificate is required in accordance with15.813-4, the contracting officer shall ensure that the certificate setforth in paragraph (b) of the clause at 52.215-32, Certificate of CommercialPricing for Parts or Components, is submitted with each offer/proposal.Notice of the requirement and requests for submission of a certificatein the solicitation is accomplished through use of the solicitation provisionat 52.215-35. Contracting officers are encouraged to enter into advanceagreements with contractors to consolidate submission requirements whendetailed repetitive certifications and justifications would otherwise berequired. (b) When requested pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subsection, offerors/contractorsare required to submit the commercial pricing certificate with their proposalsunless the contracting officer determines to grant an exemption pursuantto 15.813-5(d). Exemptions from the requirement to submit a commercialpricing certificate should not be granted pursuant to 15.813-5(d)(2) unlessthe contracting officer has sufficient information to verify that the contractor'slowest commercial price for parts or components offered for sale to thepublic are subject to such substantial differences (in quantity, quality,delivery, or other terms and conditions) from Government contract termsso as to warrant the exemption. If the contracting officer determines thatuse of the lowest commercial price for a part or component is not appropriatefor a contract under 15.813-5(d), this determination should be communicatedto the offeror/contractor in writing. Contracting officers may accept informationsupporting possible exemptions from offerors/contractors at any time priorto agreement on price. Exemptions relieve the offerors/contractors fromthe statutory and contractual submission requirement. (c) For the Department of Defense, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,and the Coast Guard, a contracting officer may make a determination thatthe definition of ``Lowest Commercial Price'' in the clause at 52.215-32shall include the price at which a sale was made to any person or corporationfor resale by the person or corporation. In making this determination,the contracting officer must be able to demonstrate that the parts or componentsare being procured by the contracting officer under the same terms andconditions at which a sale was made to the person or corporation for resale.(d) The contracting officer shall request submission of a new certificatewhen the validity of the certificate originally submitted with an offer/proposalbecomes doubtful before award because of submission of a new or revisedproposal or as a result of discussions. (e) If, after award, the contracting officer learns or suspects that acertificate was inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading, the contractingofficer shall request an audit under the authority of paragraph (c) ofthe clause at 52.215-32. If the contracting officer determines that a certificateis inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading, the Government is entitled toa price adjustment for any overcharge (see paragraph (d) of the clauseat 52.215-32). (f) Individual or class determinations made under 15.813(d) (1) or (2),and advance agreements made under paragraph (a) of this subsection, shallbe documented in the contract file. (g) Possession of a commercial pricing certificate is not a substitutefor examining a contractor's proposal and determining that the prices offeredare fair and reasonable. The certificate represents a tool to assist thecontracting officer in the determination. The contracting officer shallobtain sufficient information with regard to commercial parts or componentsto permit an understanding of the contractor's commercial pricing structureand where within that structure the acquisition fits.
