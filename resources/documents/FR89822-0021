This action is necessaryto provide controlled airspace for protection of IFR aircraft executinga recently developed Runway 9 SIAP based on the Plant City NDB. Also, minorcorrections would be made to the geographic position coordinates of BartowMunicipal, Lakeland Municipal, and Winter Haven's Gilbert Airports. Section71.181 of part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations was republished inFAA handbook 7400.6E dated January 3, 1989.The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an establishedbody of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendmentsare necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) isnot a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significantrule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluationas the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matterthat will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it iscertified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteriaof the Regulatory Flexibility Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71 </ITAG>Aviation safety, Transition areas. <ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Amendment </ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me, the Federal AviationAdministration proposes to amend Part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations(14 CFR Part 71) as follows: <ITAG tagnum="56">PART 71_DESIGNATION OF FEDERAL AIRWAYS, AREA LOW ROUTES, CONTROLLEDAIRSPACE, AND REPORTING POINTS </ITAG>1.
