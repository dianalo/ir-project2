Vo Nguyen Giaptoday embraced the leaders of military units returning fromCambodia, where the pro-Hanoi government was said to be losingterritory to guerrillas.   Before the outdoor ceremony to welcome back thousands of troops,Vietnamese generals said that their last units had left CambodiaTuesday, ending a nearly 11-year struggle against resistance forcesin the neighboring country.   Vietnam says it has now withdrawn the last 26,000 of its troopsfrom Cambodia. But the Cambodian guerrilla resistance claimsthousands of Vietnamese soldiers have stayed, disguising themselvesas Cambodians.   Rebel radio broadcasts monitored in Bangkok, Thailand, onWednesday said 3,000 Vietnamese troops were defending the gem-richCambodian town of Pailin near the Thai border from a three-prongedattack by Khmer Rouge guerrillas.   Gen. Nguyen Van Thai, chief spokesman for the Ministry ofDefense, denied the claim but said guerrilla forces had taken someterritory.   The announced Vietnamese withdrawal has raised fears thatCambodia will slide into a protracted civil war.   Wars and bloody revolution have kept Cambodia torn by conflictfor the last 20 years. The Khmer Rouge, the strongest of threeresistance groups, sent hundreds of thousands of Cambodians totheir deaths in trying to turn the country into an agrarian communefrom a nearly four-year rule that ended with Vietnam's 1978invasion.   Giap, 78, told reporters after the welcoming ceremony that peacecan be achieved in Cambodia if countries supporting the resistancerespond to Vietnam's pullout by ending their aid.   ``Now that Vietnamese troops have been withdrawn, the ball is onthe other side,'' he said. ``If they don't respond, the Cambodianpeople must continue their fighting.''   Giap a key strategist during Vietnam's war with the UnitedStates,currently is vice chairman of the Vietnamese MilitaryCouncil.   He said Vietnam would ``patiently try to achieve a politicalsolution'' to the guerrilla war in Cambodia.   ``We have created a favorable condition for a politicalsettlement by withdrawing from Cambodia. Now other countries muststop their military support'' for the guerrillas.''   China supplies arms to the insurgents, while Thailand hasallowed them to set up bases on its territory.   In the back of the troop formations during the outdoor welcomingceremony, soldiers chatted with giggling girls from Le Qui Don, anelite girls' school.   ``It's nice to talk to Vietnamese girls again,'' said a22-year-old soldier grasping a bouquet of flowers given by the highschool girls.   Few other residents of Ho Chi Minh City took part in theceremony in front of the city hall, formerly South Vietnam'spresidential palace.   ``I'm happy the soldiers have come back, so mothers and fatherswon't have to worry any more and families will stop losing theirsons,'' a shopkeeper said.   Asked if Vietnamese troops might return to Cambodia, Giap saidit now is the ``duty of the international community'' to prevent areturn of the Khmer Rouge to power.   Nguyen Vinh Nghiep, chairman of the People's Committee of Ho ChiMinh City, called the withdrawal of troops from Cambodia a bigevent for Vietnam, and said ``people all around the world arepaying attention.''   Behind him, a large banner read, ``Solidarity forever betweenthe peoples of Vietnam and Cambodia.''   Many Western countries have withheld diplomatic recognition ofVietnam and the Phnom Penh government because of Vietnam's invasionand continued military presence.   Officials from both countries say they hope the withdrawal willencourage the establishment of political and business ties withother nations.   Asked if Vietnamese troops should have withdrawn earlier fromthe stalemated guerrilla war, Giap said he disagreed:   ``American troops, after eliminating Japanese fascism, remainedin Japan, and in Germany and in South Korea. Have they been theretoo long?''   Giap said he believed the troop withdrawal would lead to peacein Cambodia.   ``I'm optimistic. I think the international community lovespeace and justice, and in the end we will find a peacefulsolution.''</TEXT></DOC>
