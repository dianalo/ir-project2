The alleged conspiracy among the three men, part of a 150-agentDrug Enforcement Administration contingent assigned to the LosAngeles area, worries officials because cases of multiple-agentcorruption are rare.   But it apparently was isolated despite increasing temptations inthe region, Assistant U.S. Attorney Joyce Karlin said.   ``Three bad apples out of the whole force is no embarrassment,''Ms. Karlin said. ``You could offer any of the DEA agents I've workedwith $1 million or $10 million to sell out and they would just laughin your face.''   The probe of alleged corruption by the trio of agents chargedwith tax evasion is widening into allegations of heroin and cashthefts from a DEA vault and cocaine trafficking, Ms. Karlin said.   Former agents John Jackson, Darnell Garcia and Wayne Countryman,already indicted for tax fraud in an alleged conspiracy to launder$608,000 through Swiss banks will face new charges, includingcocaine trafficking, by the end of January, Ms. Karlin said.   Officials have given few details on what the men are accused ofdoing. Internal Revenue Service agent John Anderson said there wasevidence the three ``were involved in money laundering and narcoticstrafficking during and following their employment.'' All three hadleft the drug agency before the indictments were handed up.   Defense lawyers have said the DEA and U.S. attorney's office aresmearing their clients with condemnations leaked to the news mediaand have alleged racism in the investigation against the agents, whoare all black.   Attorneys for all three declined requests to be interviewed byThe Associated Press.   The West Coast scandal uncovered by internal agency reviews cameduring beefed-up DEA efforts in south Florida that led many drugsmugglers to use Southern California as an alternative point ofentry.   The high cost of living, frustrations over increasing workpressures, gambling, and the alluring Hollywood lifestyle wereblamed as possible causes for the alleged corruption.   ``People get disgruntled with the system, they get disgruntledwith the work, or maybe they just get burned out,'' said Ms. Karlin,who is prosecuting the case.   The alleged tax evasion conspiracy began in 1984 and otheralleged wrongdoing occurred during the same period when the WestCoast experienced an influx of drug smuggling, she said.   ``Maybe there's something about the glitzy L.A. lifestyle, likeMiami, that attracts the corruptible _ things like the abundance ofMercedes, Jaguars, BMWs, pricey shops, fancy restaurants and luxuryhomes,'' she said.   The average DEA agent earns between $30,000 to $40,000 a year,Ms. Karlin said.   The case is significant because it involves allegations the threeagents worked together, she said.   Jackson, 39, was being held without bail because he was deemed arisk to flee or pressure witnesses in the case, Ms. Karlin said.   Countryman, 45, was freed on $120,000 bail. Garcia, 42, eludedagents following him just hours before his planned arrest andremains a fugitive.   Jackson and Countryman both pleaded not guilty when they werearraigned in U.S. District Court on Dec. 19.   The three indicted agents also are being investigated inconnection with the disappearances of heroin and cash from a DEAvault in late 1984 and early 1985, office spokesman Agent RalphLochridge said.   John Zeinter, DEA agent in charge of the Los Angeles office,refused to reveal how much heroin and cash were missing until theadditional charges were filed by federal prosecutors.   But published reports said up to five pounds of heroin worth anestimated $7.5 million and nearly $100,000 in cash vanished in atleast three separate thefts.   Agencywide figures on past corruption convictions of DEA agentswere unavailable, DEA spokesman Bill Deac said. The last Los Angelesagent convicted in a drug case was George Hoelker, who was foundguilty five years ago of conspiring to sell about five pounds ofcocaine.   Gerald Caiden, a professor at the University of SouthernCalifornia who specializes in law enforcement corruption, said theproblem is growing nationwide.   ``This case is only symptomatic of wider corruption and a generaldecline in public morality in last 30 years _ anything goes as longas you don't get caught,'' Caiden said.   Each of the three agents told colleagues of outside businessendeavors, which are now banned by the DEA, Lochridge said.   For example, Jackson reportedly explained his Mercedes-Benzsports car and sometimes heavy gambling losses during all-nightpoker games by saying he used money made from operating an Amwayfranchise.</TEXT></DOC>
