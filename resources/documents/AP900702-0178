Karem has defied three court orders to turn over his notes froma telephone interview last year with one of the two suspects jailedin the murder case.   Both the prosecution and the defense contend they need to knowwho arranged the interview to prepare their cases. Karem has saidthe source fears for his life if his identity is revealed.   On June 26, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals refused toissue a stay that would have allowed Karem to remain free while heappeals the contempt citations. The U.S. Supreme Court refused tointervene on June 27.   KMOL news director Ron Harig said the jailing was unnecessary.``The information contained in those notes could have been easilyobtained by those attorneys and the agencies they represent,'' hesaid. ``We shouldn't be an investigating arm of law enforcement.''   The jailing stems from an interview Karem conducted last yearwith capital murder defendant Henry David Hernandez, accused withhis brother Julian in the 1989 shooting death of police officerGary Williams. Henry Hernandez said during the interview that heshot the officer in self-defense.   Prosecution and defense attorneys say they have to know whoarranged the interview so that they can determine whether it can beused in the trial under rules of evidence.   Henry Hernandez' attorney does not want the interview admittedin the trial. Julian Hernandez' attorney does.   Prosecutors want to know whether any law enforcement officialwas involved, or whether any promises were made or extracted forarranging the conversation.   Karem has been held in contempt by two state district judges,most recently by State District Judge Pat Priest in February. Hehas been jailed three times in the case, each time for a few hoursbefore being released on bond.   After Priest's ruling, Karem and KMOL took the case to federalcourt. In mid-June, U.S. District Judge H.F. Garcia ruled Karemmust surrender the notes. The judge also said he would not extendthe stay that has kept Karem out of jail.</TEXT><HEAD>Judge Orders Reporter To Reveal Source</HEAD><DATELINE>ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal judge said June 25 he will ordera reporter to spend six months in prison for refusing to reveal hersource in a story detailing a policeman's domestic problems.   U.S. District Judge Edward Cahn said he would impose the orderon Terry Mutchler, a former reporter of The Morning Call and now awriter for The Associated Press in Harrisburg, within 10 days.   Cahn said he would suspend the sentence, however, while Mutchlerand the newspaper appeal to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.   The name of Mutchler's source was sought by Allentown officerKenneth Scheetz Jr. and his wife, Rosann, who have sued thenewspaper, Mutchler and her source.   The Scheetzes say a May 1989 story by Ms. Mutchler and afollow-up article about a marital fracas put the couple in a falselight and caused them emotional and mental distress.   Without disputing the accuracy of the stories, they contend shebased her writing on a stolen police report _ apparently given toher by someone in the Police Department.   The Scheetzes claim the article was designed to embarrassKenneth Scheetz, who had been named the 1988 ``Officer of theYear.''   After the session, Ms. Mutchler said, ``I gave my word that Iwould grant confidentiality to my source.''   ``My reporting can only be as good as my word, and I'm going tostand by it ... or, in this case, sit in the jail cell, if that'swhat it takes.''   The newspaper contends the story was written to illustrate thedepartment's failure to thoroughly investigate domestic squabblesinvolving officers.   In this instance, Rosann Scheetz twice sought sanctuary inpolice headquarters after being assaulted by her husband in theirhome, according to the report.</TEXT><HEAD>Subpoenas Amount to Fishing Expedition, Magazine Editor Says</HEAD><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Editors at High Times magazine say they arebracing for a challenge to their First Amendment rights: a federalinvestigation into whether the publication is part of a drugconspiracy.   Editor Steve Hager said June 25 that he and two other employeeswere subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury in New Orleans. USAToday reported that federal prosecutors are investigating the drugconspiracy theory.   High Times, which distributes 250,000 issues monthly, plans tochallenge the subpoena, and Hager said he did not plan to go or toprovide the business records and other information that wasrequested.   ``If I do go down, it will be to take the Fifth Amendment. TheBill of Rights is being systematically dismantled in the name ofthe war on drugs,'' he said.   ``I'm not exactly clear what it is they're trying to do. It'sbasically just a big fishing expedition to try to put us out ofbusiness,'' Hager added.   John Volz, the U.S. attorney in New Orleans, was in court andcould not be immediately reached for comment.   Hager said the magazine is outspoken in its support of amovement to legalize marijuana, but advises people to stay awayfrom hard drugs, as well as tobacco and alcohol.   USA Today said the Drug Enforcement Administration in Octobersearched businesses that advertised garden equipment in High Timesand arrested about 400 people for marijuana possession and otheroffenses.   High Times subsequently lost two-thirds of its advertising, saidHager.   ``This magazine would be bigger than Playboy if it weren't forgovernment intervention,'' he said.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
