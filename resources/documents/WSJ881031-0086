The jobs data, which have become a favored talisman of the economy's strength in this extended expansion, is expected to maintain the previous month's healthy 5.4% unemployment level. Estimates of the jobless rate range from 5.2% to 5.6% of the work force, according to a survey by MMI International Inc., a Redwood City, Calif., concern. The economists expect payroll employment to grow by 230,000 jobs, the consensus estimates.    &quot;Unemployment will command an enormous amount of attention,&quot; said Robert S. Gay, senior economist at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., New York. &quot;Firms don't hire unless they have something to produce,&quot; Mr. Gay noted.    The jobs report, due out a few days before the presidential election, could also provide Republicans with a last-minute hurrah -- if the forecasts are correct. President Reagan made political hay out of the September data, saying the &quot;figures tell the real story that people can understand. They mean paychecks and school clothes and families that can plan a brighter life.&quot;    The jobless rate has been hovering near a 14-year low in recent months, prompting many economists to believe the country's 70-month expansion is still on track, even if slowing. Weekly unemployment-compensation claims have been dropping lately, further evidence that jobs continue to be in good supply.    Last week's smaller-than-expected third-quarter gross national product report added to the conviction of a slowdown. But the GNP report also showed that consumer spending and imports were stronger in the quarter, raising fears about inflation. &quot;The economy was sort of in the passing lane in the first half of the year, and unemployment dropped smartly. Then suddenly in August it moved over to the cruising lane,&quot; said Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust Co., Chicago. &quot;We were going 70, now we're going 50.&quot;    Messrs. Gay and Dederick both noted that while employment may be holding up, there's been some worrisome worsening in the trade deficit. &quot;The key indicator we're looking at right now is the employment report. But given the shaky trade numbers recently, we'll get back to trade&quot; as a dominant indicator, said Mr. Dederick.    In the meantime, the economic calendar this week is heavy with lesser indicators. The September leading indicators index is expected to change only a bit. The index, which rose 0.4% in August, has been drifting up and down in recent months without pointing to a clear trend. The consensus view calls for a 0.1% increase in the September index, with estimates ranging from a drop of 0.1% to a gain of 0.4%.    Some economists, such as James Christian of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions in Washington, are beginning to be concerned that &quot;the economy is slowing too much.&quot; Weakness in the leading indicators index, on the heels of the small rise in GNP, could make that concern grow.    Mr. Christian and others are keeping close watch on the Federal Reserve, particularly in view of the GNP report's depressing effect on the dollar. &quot;You simply have to watch every little twiddle in the fed funds rate to see which way the Fed will go,&quot; said Mr. Christian. Virtually no one believes the Fed will make any adjustment to interest rates before next week's election.    The balance of this week's statistics aren't expected to show any major changes. Still, economists say they're keeping a close eye on monthly auto sales total to see if car sales picked up any steam in the last two weeks of October. Sales through mid-October rose 14.8% from year-ago levels, which were stalled by the stock market crash. But the numbers didn't meet analysts' expectations, and they're watching to see if the full-month pace matches auto makers' strong production plans for the fourth quarter.    September factory orders, due out Wednesday, are expected to fall from the previous month's strong showing. Plumped by transportation-equipment orders, August orders jumped 3.1%. The consensus calls for a 2% decline.    Long-suffering construction spending and new home sales are expected to continue soft. The consensus view for September calls for a slight rise in construction outlays and a 1.7% drop in new home sales.    ---   SLOWER GOING: Growth in the service sector continues to moderate, according to the latest reading from the Center for International Business Cycle Research at Columbia University. The center's coincident index, which measures recent economic activity, grew at an annual rate of 2.7% in September, down from 3.1% in August. The group's leading index, which anticipates economic activity several months ahead, grew at an annual rate of 2%, up from a revised 0.9% in August. Allan P. Layton, who compiles the data, said the September outcome is &quot;encouraging.&quot; But he added that the indexes have been soft through most of the year and that &quot;the service sector is apt to grow at the slower rate evident in August and September.&quot;    ---                 Closely Watched Reports       Statistics Released in the Week Ended Oct. 28                                                  CHANGE                                             (from prior                                  TOTAL          period)    Money Supply      M1 Week ended Oct. 17       (in billions)              $783.6        -$1.2      M2 Week ended Oct. 17       (in billions)              $3,043.1      +$7.0      M3 Week ended Oct. 17       (in billions)              $3,870.5      +$5.8    Real GNP      3rd Quarter, advance,       annual rate       (in trillions)             $4.007         +2.2%    Personal Income      September, annual       rate (in trillions)        $4.103         +0.5%    Durable goods orders      September (in billions)     $117.70        -4.1%    New Jobless Claims      Week ended Oct. 15          272,000        -7.2%    Personal Consumption      September, annual       rate (in trillions)        $3.264          Unch.
