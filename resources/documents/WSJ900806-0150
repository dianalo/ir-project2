On ayear-to-year basis, it was the fourth consecutive decline,and analysts see little hope for improvement in the currentquarter.   In the second quarter, net income of 639 majorcorporations fell 11% from a year earlier, a Wall StreetJournal survey finds. This compared with an 18% drop in thisyear's first quarter. After-tax earnings on continuingoperations dropped 7% in the second quarter.</LP><TEXT>   Lynn Reaser, vice president and senior economist of FirstInterstate Bank of Los Angeles, thinks the only chance forimproved profits is a stronger move toward easier money bythe Federal Reserve. &quot;If that happens we might even get amodest year-to-year gain in after-tax profits by the fourthquarter. At the moment, however, earnings are still beingsqueezed by rising wage-and-benefit costs.&quot;   Analysts at Goldman Sachs, a brokerage firm, seeindications that companies are already bolstering profitmargins, mainly by holding down labor costs through slowerhiring.   In an advance report late last month, the CommerceDepartment estimated that the inflation-adjusted grossnational product rose at an annual rate of only 1.2% in thesecond quarter. That's below the level most economists hadbeen predicting for GNP, which is the total value of thenation's output of goods and services. At last report the 52economists interviewed monthly by Blue Chip EconomicIndicators, a Sedona, Ariz., newsletter, had been looking fora 1.8% growth rate in the second quarter.   &quot;Below-average economic growth will hold profitsessentially flat over much of the 1990-92 period,&quot; sayeconomists at the Lexington, Mass., consulting firm ofDRI/McGraw-Hill. &quot;Although no recession is expected soon,neither is a boom.&quot;   Most analysts, however, expect economic growth to begin toshow some improvement late this year and in 1991. The BlueChip group at last report was expecting GNP to rise 2.2% nextyear, not exactly a roaring upturn but enough to be of somehelp to profits.   Among major groups, earnings fell for autos, banks,thrifts and steel in the second quarter, while oil companiesand the computer industry posted mixed performances.   A weaker U.S. economy, strong Japanese rivals and troublesoverseas combined to batter profits for the Big Three U.S.auto makers. General Motors, Ford and Chrysler all blamedweak demand and discounts that averaged about $1,000 avehicle for slumping U.S. auto profits. Despite massivecost-cutting, the Big Three can't simultaneously maintainearnings growth and charge prices that a soft market willbear. Meanwhile, Ford and GM had big losses in Brazil, whereeconomic upheaval is hobbling many manufacturers' operations.   Detroit won't get much relief during the rest of the year.The Big Three are bargaining with the United Auto Workersunion to replace national contracts that expire Sept. 14. Iftalks break down, a strike could cut output and hurtsuppliers, too. Meanwhile, Ford and Chrysler have signaledplans to widen profit margins by boosting prices. Butanalysts say big increases may not stick in a recession-warymarket flooded with competitively priced Japanese cars.   Chrysler faces a special problem. Output of its profitableminivans will slump this summer as the plants that build thevehicles close for major retooling.   Bank earnings were weak because of continued high levelsof problem loans, especially for commercial real estate.Manufacturers Hanover took a $100 million onetime charge forthe elimination of about 1,400 jobs. At several banks,including J.P. Morgan, strong trading results helped offsetotherwise flat corporate finance activities. A few banks,including Norwest and Banc One, managed to post healthy gainsin earnings.   Analysts expect banks' nonperforming loans to continue torise in the third quarter, keeping up the pressure onearnings. However, the rate of increase in problem loans isexpected to slow somewhat.   Thrifts were pounded by real estate problems, whichincreasingly reflected weakness in California. That'stroubling to many big thrifts, because California has beenthe last major real estate market to withstand the localizedreal estate slumps plaguing the Southwest, Northeast andother regions.   CalFed said its loss in large part reflected deteriorationin California markets. HomeFed, after special credit reviews,added $234 million to its reserve for loan losses in thesecond quarter.   Other thrifts avoided the trouble. Great Western boostedits return on assets to 0.82% from 0.58% a year earlier.Golden West, bouyed by some of the lowest costs in thebusiness, saw its return on assets jump to 0.95% from 0.86%.   Steelmakers, faced with higher costs and lower prices andshipments, saw profits plunge from last year's robust levels.   Nucor, one of the few steelmakers with improved earnings,had higher shipments on all key products and wasn't squeezedby new union contracts signed by most major steelmakers lastyear. Along with those higher labor costs, Bethlehem Steelwas hampered by scheduled maintenance programs at its prizeSparrows Point plant, which significantly reduced capacityand forced it to buy steel from other producers to meetcustomer orders. Armco, the only major steelmaker to report aloss, took about $101 million in unusual charges, including$56 million relating to a litigation settlement, while InlandSteel Industries was penalized by start-up costs from ahigh-tech steel finishing mill.   Still, steelmakers -- which had expected a soft 1990 --have been buoyed by recent strength in automotive orders andthe partial realization of price increases.   Oil profits were mixed depending on the strength ofcompanies' gasoline refining and marketing operations, whichin some cases posted record results. Sharply lower crudeprices reduced exploration and production profits almostacross the board. But those lower prices for oil -- thefeedstock for gasoline -- combined with stable pump prices topropel big increases in refining earnings. Petrochemicalresults declined sharply as a glut continues. Exxon'syear-earlier quarter included an $850 million provision toclean up the Alaskan oil spill. Mobil had one-time gains andlosses in the 1990 and 1989 quarters; without them earningswould have declined 18%.   With the surge in oil prices already this quarter, majoroil companies expect to report much stronger results, mostlyreflecting the run-up since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.   The computer industry's results in the latest quarter wereagain mixed, as competition remained cutthroat. Somecompanies also reported slowing demand in parts of Europe,which would cause big problems, because the European markethas been making up for weakness in U.S. sales for the pastfew years.   IBM did better than expected, but, even there, there wereworrying signs. Mainframe sales slowed, and IBM may faceproblems starting in the second half as it tries to managethe transition to a new generation of the big computers.Digital Equipment reported its first loss because of a $400million charge related to a plan to cut 5,000 to 6,000 jobs.It was also one of those companies seeing weakness in Europe.NCR and Amdahl had strong quarters, but Unisys andHewlett-Packard posted lackluster results, and Tandem hadproblems in Europe.   Cray's results showed their normal sharp fluctuation,which reflects the timing of supercomputer sales.   The spotty results are likely to continue for the nextquarter or two, especially if IBM does run into problems onits mainframes or if the problems in Europe spread to morecomputer makers.   Here are the second-quarter profits for various industrygroups and comparisons with the year-earlier quarter.

Maxxam'sconsolidated earnings include forest products and realestate, and also reflect above-market prices for aluminumunder long-term contracts and increased production from aJamaican refinery.   Copper company earnings were generally lower because of a3%-4% decline in the average spot price of copper. CyprusMinerals earnings were also affected by a large write-downfor its coal operations. Magma Copper, however, boostedprofit by increasing output.   Gold prices changed moderately compared with theyear-earlier quarter, but the cost of recovering goldincreased. Newmont Mining slashed costs and increased itsgold output. Net income at Newmont Gold, the company'sprimary business unit, rose 35%. Homestake Mining's earningsincreased because of an asset sale.   Lingering overcapacity continued to hurt forest-productcompanies. Newsprint and uncoated white paper producersmanaged price increases in the quarter, but markets andprices for linerboard and containerboard weakened. Pulpprices also declined from a year earlier.   Several companies blamed operational difficulties for poorearnings. Some analysts believe the cost of raw materials haspeaked. But there are growing worries in the PacificNorthwest over restrictions brought by the designation of thespotted owl as a threatened species. Moreover, analysts saidtimber sales will begin to reflect the drop in housing startsas the year proceeds.   Dow Chemical, Quantum, Vista and Carbide were hurt by thecontinuing slump in prices for basic plastics and othercommodity chemicals. Dow Chemical's results also reflectedhigher manufacturing costs because of prolonged plantmaintenance, a strike in Brazil and power outages. Morediversified companies, such as Du Pont and Monsanto, faredbetter, though their sales of agricultural chemicals werehampered by adverse weather. Du Pont also noted lower demandin the U.S. for apparel and carpet fibers. Lubrizol benefitedfrom higher prices for its specialty chemicals. Hercules hadhigher interest expenses, and its effective tax rate rose to49% from 38%. Analysts expect continuing lowcommodity-chemical prices this year, given additions inproduction capacity.

The giant equipment and service companies reapedthe benefits of several years of cost-cutting and industryconsolidation. A number of companies also said they were ableto make price increases that stuck. And drilling companiesnarrowed their losses as restructuring is paying off. Thissector could show steady improvement if expected increases indrilling activity materialize.   With prices and volume low for the quarter, natural-gaspipeline companies felt the pinch. Customers in the Northeastswitched to other fuels, while markets in the Midwestcontinue to be overrun with competitors. Those and otherfactors combined to hammer Panhandle Eastern, which slashedits dividend 60% and expects more belt-tightening because ofenvironmental cleanup costs and adverse regulatory rulings.That company has tabled a number of expansion projects andcould see a further drop in volume when certain rates to theNortheast go up in December. Meanwhile, Burlington Resource'spipeline unit saw a 4% increase in operating profit.   Coal companies posted higher earnings for the quarterlargely from stronger prices and volume. Another reason forthe improvement was that last year's results were hurt bywildcat strikes staged in support of the United Mine Workersunion against Pittston.

ButBurlington Northern benefited from strong coal shipments, andCSX reported improved results at its rail, barge andcontainer shipping units. Excluding gains of $62 million fromsale of subsidiaries in the 1989 quarter, CSX's earnings fromcontinuing operations rose 20%.   Trucking-company earnings were hurt by overcapacity andhigher fuel and labor costs. Consolidated Freightways saidlosses at its Emery air-freight unit more than offsetearnings improvement at its truck units. A 3% rate increaseimplemented in June is expected to boost third-quarterresults for carriers that handle less than full-truckloadshipments.   The slump in second-quarter net at American President, anocean, rail and truck transporter, reflected a decline ininternational shipment volumes, rate pressures and increasedequipment costs.   The air-freight industry performed about as expected, withAirborne Freight continuing its torrid growth and FederalExpress still having problems overseas. Airborne, known asthe industry's lowest-cost producer, is still benefiting fromproblems at Consolidated Freightways' Emory unit, and mayalso be eating into Federal Express's U.S. business. FederalExpress continues to post international losses of millions ofdollars a month, and is facing lower Asian demand and slowerU.S. volume growth as well. Airborne is expected to continueits heady growth, while there's no end in sight for Federal'swoes.   In transportation equipment, the downturn in the marketfor big trucks continued to squeeze profits, and there's noconsensus on when a rebound might start. Navistar sees an 18%decline in industry shipments of heavy trucks and a 4%decline in medium trucks for its fiscal year, which ends Oct.31. Cummins Engine says third-quarter production of heavytrucks is expected to fall 10% from a year earlier; itexpects a loss for the period. But Eaton, which makes trucktransmissions and axles, sees &quot;indications&quot; the heavy truckmarket will improve by year end.   Profit gains continued for heavy machinery, but a steepdecline at giant Caterpillar dragged down overall results.Brazil's stiff anti-inflation and economic-reform plan waspartly behind the tumbling profit at Caterpillar. Troubles inBrazil also curbed the profit gain at Clark Equipment. Salesof Caterpillar's construction equipment slowed in the U.S.and other industrialized nations. For the full year, thecompany expects &quot;substantially lower&quot; profit than in 1989.While farm-equipment sales for companies such as Deere arelikely to continue robust, there are signs of a slowdown forother heavy machinery. Clark says &quot;emerging softness in worldmarkets&quot; could reduce its second-half earnings. Deere is &quot;cautious&quot; on the outlook for sales of its construction equipmentin North America.

In California, wherehomebuilding had remained relatively healthy, concern overanticipated defense cuts has stalled consumer confidence andstarted to weigh heavily on new construction. StandardPacific and Kaufman andamp; Broad said the weakening Californiamarket contributed to earnings declines. Analysts predict acontinued drop in homebuilding through year end.   Retailers are likely to report mixed results for the Julyquarter. But some companies posting higher profits areexpected to show smaller increases than in recent quarters.   Sears Roebuck, which operates on a calendar year, alreadyreported a 39% decline in net income; but sluggish sales andhigher expenses resulted in a 78% profit plunge at thecompany's core U.S. retail business. Analysts expect J.C. Penney to report sharply lower earnings, and Nordstrom andDayton Hudson are likely to post slightly lower net. U.S.Shoe projects a profit decline because of falling sales atits Lenscrafters stores. Earnings growth is likely to remainrobust at Wal-Mart, Dillard, Limited and Gap. K mart isexpected to show a small increase in profit.   Hotel and casino companies faced continued overcapacity inthe lodging market, as well as new casino competition. Somehotel operators, including Marriott, Motel 6 and La QuintaMotor Inns, reported slight to moderate improvement inoperating results. Hilton Hotels experienced mixed resultsfrom its hotels and a sharp drop in operating revenue at oneof its Las Vegas, Nev., casinos. Golden Nugget's large newLas Vegas casino-resort produced a major improvement inearnings, while Aztar's operating improvement wasovershadowed by a provision for a legal judgment against thecompany. Circus Circus Enterprises' fiscal quarter endedApril 30 didn't include results from its big new casino inLas Vegas.   Some analysts worry that sluggishness in consumer spendingmay rub off on travel and tourism in this quarter.   The restaurant business generally remained soft. Pricediscounting at fast-food sites was rampant, intensifyingcompetition and squeezing profit margins. McDonald's 10%earnings gain trailed analysts' expectations. The quarter wasbrighter for casual sit-down places, such as Shoney's.   Casual sit-down restaurants have benefited from thenarrowing gap in non-promotional menu prices betweenmidpriced diners and fast-food outlets. For the thirdquarter, with the same trends intact, Montgomery Securitiesforecasts a 12% increase in McDonald's per-share earnings anda 44% gain for Shoney's.   Entertainment-industry earnings &quot;are becoming weaker,&quot;said Harold Vogel, a first vice president at Merrill Lynch andamp;Co. &quot;The domestic box office is down from a year ago and thecost of making and releasing films is up.&quot; Theme-parkattendance, he said, &quot;has flattened out for the currentquarter.&quot; Lisbeth Barron, a vice president of research atS.G. Warburg Securities, said Time Warner was hurt byweakness in magazine earnings and flat performance in itsHome Box Office unit. &quot;The record business has sloweddramatically,&quot; she added. Paramount's year-earlier resultsinclude $70.9 million in after-tax income from discontinuedoperations.   Demand for outboard engines continued to decline.&quot;Sluggish demand for boats continues. It's more of the samefor Outboard Marine and Brunswick,&quot; said Mr. Vogel.   In the media sector, television networks stood out withmoderate to strong results. CBS was boosted largely by itstelecast of the National Basketball Association playoffs andchampionship game, and by a drop in programming cost from ayear earlier. At Capital Cities/ABC, lukewarm results weredue to sluggish advertising sales at its television and radiostations and to losses on the new baseball contract at its80%-owned cable channel, ESPN.   Ad demand continued its fall for most newspapers, and thatled to poor results for most newspaper-based media companies.Gannett, the country's largest newspaper publisher, reportedits first quarterly drop in earnings in more than 22 years.   Although fuel prices moderated somewhat,weaker-than-expected domestic traffic and select fare warsdepressed airline earnings. Results at AMR's AmericanAirlines also were hurt by start-up costs for its new serviceto Latin America. Midway Airlines' loss reflected continuingexpenses at its new Philadelphia hub. Delta was aided lastyear by a strike at its chief competitor on the East Coast,Eastern Airlines.

More abundant soybean and corncrops helped Archer-Daniels-Midland's results growsubstantially. General Mills benefited from continued goodvolume gains of ready-to-eat cereals. Campbell Soup citedbetter cost controls in North America and higher profit inArgentina. Dean Foods, alone in reporting a decline in netincome, actually posted an operating earnings gain, butyear-earlier figures included proceeds from the sale of itsBaskin-Robbins business. Hershey Foods' latest resultsinclude a $35 million gain from sale of a Swedishconfectionery unit. Prudential-Bache Securities food analystJohn McMillin expects many sector companies to reportlow-double-digit profit gains for the current quarter.   Food retailers continued to enjoy healthy tobetter-than-expected overall gains, thanks to robust sales,improved margins, better cost controls and lower interestrates. Analysts cited the greater control that supermarketcompanies are exercising in wholesale buying and continuedexpansion of upscale specialty departments.   Von's reversed the loss it sustained a year earlier afterabsorbing the acquisi tion of Safeway's stores in SouthernCalifornia.   From beer to soft drinks to bottling, the big beveragecompanies uncorked profit increases. Strong business overseasmore than offset weak sales at home for Coca-Cola. Pepsi'sdomestic soft-drink volume growth outpaced Coke's, andPepsi's earnings were bolstered by higher sales of snack andrestaurant foods. Coca-Cola Enterprises' net included severalextraordinary items, notably a $55.6 million pretax gain fromthe sale of a business. Anheuser-Busch and Adolph Coorsreported higher beer shipments, reflecting strong sales ofnew brands.   Personal care companies reported solid earnings.International sales remained strong, while continued lowmaterials costs and slight price increases boosted profits.Neutrogena, a specialty soap and shampoo maker, was the clearexception; earnings plunged because of increased competition,swollen inventories and problems with new products.   Profits continued strong for household product concerns,and profit margins continued to expand, thanks in part to along truce in the consumer goods marketing wars. Withinternational sales healthy, profits got a boost fromfavorable currency translations. More of the same is expectedfor the current quarter.   Once again, tobacco makers reported large gains, despitethe industry's troubled image. Strong sales overseas andsmaller-than-expected volume decreases in the U.S. areexpected to continue.

Analysts expect Intel tomaintain a fat profit in the current quarter while a seasonalsummer slowdown brings continued sluggishness for other chipmakers and for equipment makers such as Applied Materials,which still feel lingering effects of last year's chip slump.Companies expect the profit picture to remain fragmenteduntil next year, when chip demand is expected to pick upacross the board. National had a $174 million special gain inthe 1989 quarter.   Software makers continued to benefit from strong sales ofdesktop computers and the growing appetite for moresophisticated business software. Lotus Development posted thebiggest profit gain on the strength of broad acceptance ofits newest spreadsheet products. Microsoft's net income wasboosted by rapid growth in Europe and the initial reaction toits new version of its Windows product. Novell and OracleSystems were aided by the continued shift to networkedcomputing, which puts a premium on the data base andnetworking software sold by them.   At American Telephone andamp; Telegraph, a costly credit-cardlaunch and sluggish equipment sales shaved long-distancegains and cut profit. Motorola's profit increase was poweredmainly by higher semiconductor and cellular equipment sales.Communications Satellite inched up after software problems inits Video Entertainment unit offset gains in itsInternational and Systems businesses.   Most aerospace companies' results reflected generalweakness in Pentagon contracting. The big loser was GeneralDynamics, which took a stunning $500 million in write-offs toreflect overruns on the Navy's A-12 attack plane program andthe Army's Sincgars radio project. McDonnell Douglas,co-developer of the A-12, used a different accounting methodand sidestepped any charges. A year earlier, it posted $93million in write-offs on its C-17 military cargo and KC-10tanker programs. Northrop's year-before results included a$150 million loss provision on a classified researchcontract.   The outlook is mixed, with commercial aircraft makers anddefense-electronics companies expected to outperform thefield. Peter Aseritis of First Boston says the picture willbecome clearer only after the pending military budget iscomplete.   Many medical-equipment makers continued to benefit fromdominant positions in specialized and stable markets. In thebiotechnology field, Amgen remained one of the few concernsthat could cultivate a profit, as many companies remained inthe start-up phase.   St. Jude Medical said the latest period's resultsreflected continued penetration of its primary heart-valvemarket. Stryker has achieved its growth rate by bringing outsuch well-received products as hip implants and surgicaltools.   In general, &quot;there is a greater certainty of earningsgrowth with health care relative to other industries,&quot; saidLeonard Yaffe, an analyst at Montgomery Securities. &quot;Giventhe demographics and pricing flexibility, companies can growat more predictable rates.&quot;                                                                                                          DATA PROCESSING                                                                                                          -- COMPUTERS/INFORMATION                                                                                                                                      2nd Qtr.    2nd Qtr.    %  14 Firms                      1990        1989      Chg                                                                                                          Amdahl Corp                 46,326      32,807   + 41   Apple Computer             119,764      96,129   + 25   Compaq Computer            104,277      83,940   + 24   Control Data                11,200    -497,300    ...

Higher earnings in the group health insurance areaboosted results for several of the multiline insurers. Forlife insurance companies, better interest-rate spreads,expense reduction and a continued decline in policycancellations helped improve profitability.   Kemper took $161.1 million in special charges. Cigna saidthe poor conditions in the property/casualty market willconstrain its results this year and in 1991. It expects totake a charge of no more than $65 million as it acceleratesthe consolidation of some offices. Aetna benefited from gainsin its group health insurance and its pension and investmentbusinesses.   Securities firms' profits rebounded a bit from a depressedfirst quarter, with Merrill Lynch and Salomon reporting amodest revival in investment-banking revenue. Butyear-to-year profit comparisons were poor because 1989'ssecond quarter was particularly strong. Despite the reboundat Merrill and Salomon, investment-banking and underwritingrevenue at most firms stand at six-year lows. Many securitiesfirms continued to increase the customer assets they manage,which rake in steady fees.   But even near-record levels in the stock market couldn'trevive sluggish trading, a revival that analysts say isnecessary to jump-start the flagging earnings at many bigfirms. This quarter won't be much better for many brokers,particularly compared with 1989's strong third quarter,analysts say.
