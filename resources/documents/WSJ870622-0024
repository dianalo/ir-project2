Sainsbury said it raised its stake in Shaw's, an East Bridgewater, Mass.-based supermarket chain, to 49.4% from 28.5%, paying $30 a share, or $76.5 million, for 2.6 million shares from the Davis family, Shaw's former majority owners. As a second step, Sainsbury said it will launch a tender offer of $30 a share, or $184.4 million, for the approximately 6.1 million shares still outstanding. Sainsbury said it is sure to obtain at least 74% of Shaw's because of support from the Davis family and Shaw's board.    To help fund the purchase of Shaw's, Sainsbury raised the equivalent of $188 million through a new issue of 20.2 million ordinary shares to Warburg Securities, a British stockbroker.    Sainsbury, Britain's largest supermarket operator, is joining a lengthening parade of British companies seeking growth in the U.S., but it has chosen a cautious route. The company bought its first stake in Shaw's in 1983, hoping eventually to acquire the company to diversify its geographical base.    &quot;Most U.K. companies who go out to the States take a certain amount of risk; they either don't know the industry or the market, or they don't know the management,&quot; said Aine Kelly, an analyst at Kleinwort Grieveson Securities Ltd., a London broker. &quot;Here we have a situation where they've been in there since 1983.&quot;    (Among other foreign holdings in the U.S. food-retailing field are Great Atlantic andamp; Pacific Tea Co., 52.4%-owned by Tenglemann Group, of West Germany, and Grand Union Co., acquired in 1977 by Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith.)    Shaw's operates 49 supermarkets in New England and, according to Sainsbury, ranks third in the region behind Boston-based Stop andamp; Shop Cos. and Woodbridge, N.J.-based Supermarkets General Corp. Shaw's had net income of $16.2 million on sales of $1.1 billion in the year ended Jan. 3.    Sainsbury, which had pre-tax profit of #268.1 million ($436.6 million) and net income of #158 million on sales of #4.04 billion in the year ended March 21, is one of Britain's more highly regarded companies. Pre-tax profit, up 28% last year, has risen by 20% or more every year since 1980.    The 120-year-old company in recent years has focused on building ever-larger stores in Britain's prosperous south. It sells the British about 10% of everything they eat and drink, double its market share 10 years ago. It has invested heavily in modernizing its stores with computerized checkouts and inventory systems, and is planning to accelerate its rate of new-store openings over the next few years.    In Britain, Sainsbury and its major rivals rely heavily on the sales of private-label products to build their own identities and customer loyalty. Offerings include own-brand champagne and smoked salmon as well as more mundane staples. &quot;The own-label thing is very different in the U.S. than it is here,&quot; said Nigel Matthews, company secretary, who added that Sainsbury won't seek to push its approach in the U.S. &quot;In retailing, and particularly food retailing, you've got to do things within that particular market.&quot;    Sainsbury likes Shaw's focus on the healthy New England economy. Mr. Matthews said Sainsbury doesn't have any plans to expand beyond New England, but would support Shaw's present expansion plans within the region. Sir John Sainsbury, chairman of Sainsbury, said the two companies share similar &quot;operating styles and backgrounds.&quot; Sainsbury said about 14% of its sales will be outside Britain as a result of the Shaw's purchase.    David B. Jenkins, Shaw's president and chief executive officer, said, &quot;Shaw's management team looks forward with enthusiasm to drawing on Sainsbury's experience and resources.&quot; Shaw's also noted the companies' &quot;mutually beneficial relationship&quot; over the past four years.    ---   Christopher J.
