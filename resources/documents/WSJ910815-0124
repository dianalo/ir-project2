The source said the loan was made yesterday throughZenshinren Bank, the national association for Japan's creditunions. The central bank earlier said it was prepared tosupport Toyo Shinkin, a small credit bank hit by fraud, buthadn't made clear that it already had provided funds.</LP><TEXT>   The central bank has also indicated that if further fundsare needed, officials at the Finance Ministry and the centralbank will pressure Toyo Shinkin's affiliates, includingIndustrial Bank of Japan and Sanwa Bank, to provide thefunds.   This week, Toyo Shinkin officials filed a complaint withOsaka authorities alleging that the institution was thevictim of a loan fraud totaling 360 billion yen. The bank'sliabilities in the scandal remain unclear.   In other developments in Japan's swirling financialscandals, Kyodo news service reported that Industrial Bank ofJapan provided 300 billion yen in loans to 61-year-old NuiOnoue, the central figure in the Toyo Shinkin fraud. Ms.Onoue, a proprietor of an Osaka restaurant, was arrestedTuesday on suspicion of obtaining 342 billion yen in loansfrom nonbank institutions with false documents. The IBJloans, Kyodo said, weren't included in the 342 billion yen,but it isn't known whether they were obtained with falsedocuments.   An IBJ spokesman declined to comment on the amount ofloans given to Ms. Onoue. He said that the bank startedlending money to Ms. Onoue four years ago and that she wasthe largest individual shareholder in IBJ. He said thatrecently, the bank had been cutting back its dealings withMs. Onoue because they were &quot;rather large for an individualcustomer.&quot;   Separately, the Osaka public prosecutor's office arrestedEiichiro Hayata, head of a branch office of Daishinpan Co.,an Osaka consumer credit company, on suspicion of breach oftrust. The 38-year-old Mr. Hayata is suspected of conspiringto withdraw Daishinpan debentures without permission,enabling Ms. Onoue to use them as collateral to borrow 10billion yen from Daishinpan, prosecutors said. It was thethird Toyo Shinkin-related arrest, following by a day thearrests of Ms. Onoue and Tomomi Maekawa, a former branchmanager of Toyo Shinkin.</TEXT></DOC>
