Both the casesof the two-ion hybrid resonance heating and second harmonic cyclotronresonance heating are investigated by solving the global wave equation.Accessibility range and antenna loading impedance for various plasmaparameters as well as the power deposition profile are obtained. Thegeneration of fast ions is also discussed. (orig.)</TEXT></DOC>
