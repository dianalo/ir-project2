F/A-18 fighters to Seoul, paving the way for anagreement to be signed within the next few days.   The 120-aircraft, $3 billion deal hit a snag a couple ofmonths ago when the Koreans demanded that the U.S. hand oversensitive aviation technology.</LP><TEXT>   Congressional critics of the transaction, led by Sen. AlanDixon (D., Ill.), have expressed fears that the U.S. willhelp build Korea's aerospace sector into a serious economicrival, undermining one of the few industries in which theU.S. maintains a trade surplus. That same issue was debatedvociferously on Capitol Hill last spring when lawmakersconsidered the fate of the FSX fighter with Japan. Thatproject, however, calls for co-development of the airplanewith General Dynamics Corp. as opposed to the much morestandard co-production arrangement with the Koreans.   Seoul, for its part, was worried that the U.S. would buyback only 30% of the contract's total value in Korean goods-- a standard practice known as &quot;offsetting&quot;; it is notunusual in military equipment sales for the offset to becloser to 100%.   Just how those concerns have been resolved wasn'timmediately clear. Congressional sources said the U.S.appeared to have caved in on a few key points, includingsoftening its stance on offsets and allowing the Koreansaccess to certain engine and flight-control technology.However, the influential Dong-A Ilbo newspaper reported thatthe accord was modified to make it more difficult for SouthKorea to acquire sophisticated U.S. technology, especiallycomputer and radar systems.   Either way, there is little doubt that progress has beenmade. A spokesman for St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas saidTuesday that talks between the two countries &quot;are going well,and an announcement is expected soon.&quot; An industry sourceadded that McDonnell Douglas has scheduled a meeting for nextweek with its subcontractors to plot legislative strategy.   Late last year, the Koreans formally selected the F/A-18,dubbed the Hornet, over General Dynamics's F-16. Thegovernment plans to buy 12 F/A-18s off the shelf, assembleanother 36 from kits sent from U.S. factories, and thenco-produce another 72 planes on South Korean soil.   Negotiators have been working furiously to conclude a pactso lawmakers will have sufficient time to elicit publiccomment on it, as is required, and still be able to sign offon the deal during the current congressional session.   Once the agreement hits Capitol Hill, though, it is sureto cause something of a stir. The Koreans have been accusedin the past of improperly selling U.S. military hardware tothird countries.   Sen. Dixon, aides say, may still decide to introduce aresolution to scuttle the Korea Fighter Project entirely;that tack, however, is unlikely to get very far. Of even moreconcern to lobbyists backing the program is that restrictivelanguage will be imposed upon the contract, making itunpalatable to the Koreans.   &quot;There will be a lot of posturing, but there is nothingunusual or threatening about this sale,&quot; asserted JoelJohnson, vice president of international activities for theAerospace Industries Association, a Washington, D.C., tradegroup. &quot;What would be more threatening is if we mess this upand they turn around and buy European aircraft instead.&quot;   &quot;Congressmen,&quot; Mr. Johnson added, &quot;keep forgetting that wehave current competitors.&quot;   ---   Damon Darlin contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
