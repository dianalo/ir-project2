In a letter in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine,doctors report a case of steroid dependence in a man who regularlytook four kinds of steroids.   The 23-year-old body-builder told doctors he could not stoptaking anabolic steroids without experiencing withdrawal symptoms,depression and disabling fatigue. He said he sometimes feltuncontrollably violent, paranoid and suicidal.   After a week off steroids, he told doctors that he couldn't bearhis depression, fatigue and drug craving and intended to resumetaking the drugs.   ``Some of the clinical features of this patient resemble thosefrequently observed in cases of opioid dependence,'' the doctorswrote.   The letter was written by Drs. Forest Tennant of CommunityHealth Projects Medical Group in West Covina, Calif., David L.Black of Vanderbilt Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Hospital inNashville and Robert O. Voy of the U.S. Olympic Committee.   Other researchers have also pointed out that people who abusesteroids may suffer hallucinations, delusions, manic episodes andother temporary mental illness.   According to one estimate, as many as 1 million athletes in theUnited States may be using steroids to build up their muscles. Thedrugs retard the tendency of muscle to break down.   Steroids can also cause a variety of other side effects,including liver damage, sterility and testicular shrinking.</TEXT></DOC>
