Just at the time judges broadened definitions ofnegligence and strict liability to help plaintiffs pick thedeep pockets of corporate defendants, the Supreme Courtexpanded the immunity of those defendants lucky enough to bejournalists. The 1964 case of New York Times v. Sullivan,which made libel suits harder to win, also made it harder formany writers to understand why people in other fieldscomplain so bitterly about the liability crisis.   Years after drug manufacturers, banks and insurancecompanies saw huge increases in lawsuits, journalism has nowlost its litigation innocence. In two recent cases, thejustices warned writers that if they make up quotes orviolate agreements to protect sources they can expect to besued and to lose. These practices are probably notwidespread, and the court crafted limits to how many lawsuitsthe press can expect. But the justices may have known whatthey were doing by making journalists see first hand theproblems in this country of over-legalizing.</LP><TEXT>   Imagine the legal insulation of a magazine that couldargue that concocted quotes don't amount to libel. This wasthe defense in Masson v. New Yorker, where psychoanalystJeffrey Masson accused Janet Malcolm of making up quotes thatmade him look absurd. Mr. Masson was especially angry aboutbeing quoted as saying, &quot;I was like an intellectual gigolo.&quot;What he said in a tape-recorded conversation was, &quot;I was, ina sense, much too junior within the heirarchy of analysis forthese important training analysts to be caught dead with me.&quot;   The federal appeals court in California dismissed hislibel suit by ruling that writers could print &quot;rationalinterpretations&quot; of what people said instead of what theyactually said. Judge Alex Kozinski dissented, saying that adoctored quote &quot;is no more protected by the First Amendmentthan is any other falsehood.&quot;   All nine Supreme Court justices agreed to reinstate Mr.Masson's $10 million lawsuit by ruling that made-up quotescan be libelous. Whoever wins at the libel trial, the NewYorker scored few points with the justices, who referred toit as &quot;a magazine which at the relevant time seemed to enjoya reputation for scrupulous factual accuracy.&quot;   The majority Supreme Court opinion, written by JusticeAnthony Kennedy, said that to be a libelous misquote, even adeliberate alteration must result in a &quot;material change inthe meaning conveyed by the statement.&quot; At first glance, thisseems to limit the misquotes that can lead to libel suits.Certainly changes for grammar and syntax are fine, but thereference to &quot;material change&quot; should send fear through thepress galleries.   Securities lawyers make their careers litigating over themeaning of materiality; last week the Securities and ExchangeCommission dropped a five-year-old case against Wall Streetlawyer George Kern over when takeover information becomes somaterial it must be disclosed. The separate opinion in Massonby Justice Byron White, joined by Justice Antonin Scalia,offered the less vague test that any &quot;deliberatemisquotation&quot; could go to a jury.   The press can probably expect greater litigation troublesfrom Cohen v. Cowles Media, the case about disclosingsources. Journalists often ask judges to protect them fromdisclosing their sources in criminal trials. Here they askedthe justices to dismiss a lawsuit from a source they decidedto burn.   During the 1982 Minnesota gubernatorial race, Dan Cohen,an adviser to the Republican candidate, offered informationabout the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor. Mr.Cohen provided information about the opposing candidate'sminor criminal record on the condition that he not be namedas the source.   The reporters agreed, but their editors at the MinneapolisStar Tribune and St. Paul Pioneer Press decided to revealthat Mr. Cohen was the source. This made for a moreinteresting story -- who leaked and why is often asinteresting as the material disclosed -- but when Mr. Cohenwas fired from his job he sued the newspapers. A jury awardedhim $200,000 in compensatory damages and $500,000 in punitivedamages.   The newspapers argued that the First Amendment protectedthem from the consequences of violating their agreement witha source. The Supreme Court disagreed, saying that nothing inthe Constitution protects the press from &quot;generallyapplicable&quot; laws, including agreements to keep identitiessecret. Justice White noted that &quot;the press may not withimpunity break and enter an office or dwelling to gathernews,&quot; and is as bound as other industries by everything fromthe National Labor Relations Act and Fair Labor Standards Actto antitrust and tax laws.   It's possible that state courts will refuse to enforcethese confidentiality contracts as against public policy, butthis case could open the litigation floodgates. Courts todayare likely to second-guess even contracts that have fewambiguities. Yet compared even with contracts for rentalcars, motion-picture profits and insurance policies,contracts between sources and journalists are models ofuncertainty.   For one thing, agreements to keep material confidentialare almost always oral, which will make false claims hard todisprove. What also makes this issue likely to end up incourt is that there is no common understanding about what theterms of the agreements mean. There's &quot;background,&quot; &quot;deepbackground,&quot; &quot;off the record&quot; and &quot;not for attribution.&quot;These nuances supposedly define the agreement about howprecisely someone will be identified.   Several lawsuits are already in the courts complainingabout broken confidentiality agreements. The press could soonfind itself responding to constant judicial oversight throughlawsuits. If so, journalists will search for ways to copewith the constant risk of litigation. Maybe the AmericanSociety of Newspaper Editors will move toward some sort ofquasi-legal guidelines -- maybe a Uniform Agreement forConfidential Sources Including Definitions of Terms. If theexperience of other industries is any sign, though, thesteady expansion of liability will outpace anyself-regulatory efforts to keep ahead of liability.   Despite losing the cases, these rulings could helpjournalism. Readers will have a greater assurance ofcredibility if they can again assume that statements indirect quotes were made by the person supposedly quoted.Sources are likelier to offer information if they know theycan sue if their agreements are violated.   But most of all, these rulings could improve journalism byhelping writers understand that there is a cost to alwaysmore lawsuits, more rules, more regulations. There are manygood articles yet to be written on the dangers to everyone oflitigation as the first resort for resolving disagreements,not the last.</TEXT></DOC>
