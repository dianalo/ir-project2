ROSENFELD</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Meredith Corp. said Friday its earningsshot up more than six times in the first quarter of its fiscalyear, reflecting one-time gains from the sale of assets.   Earnings from continuing operations nudged up just 1.3 percentfor the diversified media company with interests in publishing,broadcasting and real estate. Meredith is best known for its BetterHomes and Gardens and Ladies' Home Journal magazines.   It reported profit of $60.9 million, or $3.62 a share, in thefirst quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with $9.3 million, or 50cents a share, in the same period a year ago.   The latest results included gains of $49.3 million fromMeredith's share of thesale of Meredith-Burda printing business toR.R. Donnelley and Sons Co. and almost $3.6 million from the saleof Sail magazine to Cahners Publishing.   Revenue rose 3.6 percent to $179.4 million from $173.1 million ayear earlier.   Earnings from continued operations rose to almost $5.4 million,or 32 cents a share, from nearly $5.2 million, or 28 cents a share.   Jack Rehm, Meredith's president, said the improvement infirst-quarter earnings from continuing operations reflectedincreased profits from broadcast operations and higher interestincome.   The interest income was associated with a note received from thesale of the printing operation that had been jointly owned with theBurda family of Germany.   ``The Broadcasting Group benefited from lower operationsexpenses. The reduction was primarily due to lower programmingcosts that resulted from the fiscal 1990 write down of syndicatedprogramming investments,'' Rehm said.   The broadcast writedown was just one of several factors thatproduced a $49.9 million loss in the fourth quarter and a loss of$26.4 million for the full fiscal year that ended June 30.   Rehm reported operating earnings were held down in the firstquarter by a reduction in the number of advertising pages inmagazines, a drop in results from real estate operations andheavier returns of book club products.   A previously announced program to repurchase stock reduced theaverage outstanding shares to 16.8 million as of Sept. 30 from 18.7million a year earlier.   In trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, Meredith stockgained 50 cents to close at $21.75 per share.</TEXT></DOC>
