The sudden, panicky mass exodus of foreigners this past week fromthe People's Republic because of the violent crackdown on a growingpro-democracy movement portends a dark and chilly era for foreigninvestment and trade. Few are expected to quickly return, even ifthings quiet down for awhile.   Although the biggest U.S. multinationals with offices in Chinaaren't likely to disengage themselves, many smaller companies saythey can't easily afford to risk their money in a country wherepolitical stability is now so uncertain.   ``The commercial and economic relations between the United Statesand China, so carefully nurtured and developed through the effortsof people on both sides over the past 18 years and so clearly in theoverall strategic interest of both our two countries, have beendisrupted and could suffer long-term damage,'' the U.S. ChinaBusiness Council declared.   Hundreds of joint ventures worth billions of dollars havesuddenly been put on hold or severely curtailed, affecting factoryconstruction and exports ranging from crude oil to luggage tohand-held hairdryers.   China's lucrative tourist trade, which earned more than $2billion in foreign currency annually for the Chinese, has collapsedat the busiest time of year. The outlook is uncertain.   Even foreign-financed projects hundreds of miles from Beijinghave been disrupted, partly because of a State Department warningthat Americans should leave the country due to the threat ofwidespread unrest.   In Shanghai, Douglas Aircraft expatriates vacated a joint-ventureassembly plant and said upon arriving in Hong Kong they had no ideathere was such turmoil in the Chinese capital. In a remote coalfieldsouthwest of Beijing, Occidental Petroleum temporarily yanked itsstaff from an open-pit mine although work had been proceedingnormally.   In the south, where the bulk of foreign-Chinese joint ventureshave been established, many U.S. businesses reportedly startedmaking contingency plans to shift production to other cheap-laborcountries such as Mexico, Thailand and the Philippines, fearingdisruption of exports from China.   On a broader scale, the chaos in China severely jolted thestability of British-ruled Hong Kong, the financial powerhousescheduled to be surrendered to the Chinese in 1997.   It sent investors fleeing for dollar-denominated investments,roiling other financial markets. It forced banks to reevaluate theirexposure to debt owed not only by the Chinese but by foreigncompanies that rely on Chinese trade.   Millions of dollars in Chinese-issued bonds, sold abroad to raisemoney for economic development, are suddenly worth less and willaggravate the country's recent efforts to raise money in worldcredit markets.   Economically, there is nothing about the crackdown that bodeswell for China or companies that have banked their future on amarket of 1.1 billion people with rising expectations, China expertssay.   But some argue that in the long run, the consequences could provebeneficial by forcing the Beijing government to moderate itshardline position in order to lure foreigners and their money back.   In other business and economic news this past week:   _A battle flared for Time Inc., threatening to derail the mediagiant's merger with Warner Communications Inc. A $10.7 billion offerfor Time by Paramount Communications Inc. sent Time's stock soaringand resurrected a theory on Wall Street that no company is immune toa takeover.   _A federal jury convicted speculator Paul A.

Bilzerian planned toappeal.   _Banks cut their prime lending rate to 11 percent from 11.5percent, reflecting a trend toward lower borrowing costs. But it wasuncertain how long the decline would last, because the governmentreported a surge in May inflation that could make the FederalReserve tighten credit again _ sending rates higher.</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for weekend editions May 10-11</NOTE></DOC>
