Mr. Kalliel, who was the subject of a page one story in The Wall Street Journal in August 1985, was also ordered to pay $2.4 million in restitution to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.    Last July, a federal jury here convicted him of 19 counts of wire fraud and one count of providing a false financial statement to the Rexford State Bank of Rexford, Kan. The Justice Department attorney who tried the case said Mr. Kalliel's financial statement put his net worth at $84 million when it was actually negative.    Mr. Kalliel plans to appeal the verdict, his attorney said. </TEXT></DOC>
