The Partnership was organized under the California Revised Limited PartnershipAct as a vehicle for equity investment in apartment complexes (``ApartmentComplexes'') eligible for low income housing tax credits under the InternalRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (``Code''), or, in certain cases, forhistoric rehabilitation tax credits under the Code (``Tax Credits'') andassistance under other governmental programs promoting low- or moderate-incomehousing.2. The Partnership will operate as a ``two-tier'' partnership by investingprimarily as a limited partner in other partnerships (``Local Partnerships'')which will develop, rehabilitate, own, and operate Apartment Complexes.\1\<NOTE/> Local Partnerships will be primarily limited partnerships,but also may be general partnerships or joint ventures. However, the Partnershipwill invest no more than 10% of its funds in general partnerships or jointventures. The Partnership's investment objectives are: (a) To provide QualifiedInvestors (defined herein) current tax benefits in the form of Tax Creditsto offset their federal income tax liability; (b) to preserve and protectthe Partnership's capital; and (c) to provide cash distributions.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The Partnership may invest in Apartment Complexes thathave commercial, retail or office space, but only if such space (a) ismerely an ancillary feature of the Apartment Complex's overall developmentstructure, (b) does not represent the primary tax or economic motivationunderlying the Partnership's investment in the Apartment Complex, and (c)does not generate in excess of 20% of the anticipated total gross rentalincome of the Apartment Complex.3. The Partnership will normally acquire at least a 90% interest in theprofits, losses and Tax Credits, as well as a specified interest in thecash distributions, of the Local Partnerships, with the balance remainingwith the local general partners. Should the Partnership invest in any LocalPartnership in which it acquires less than 50% of the limited partnershipinterest, the Partnership's partnership agreement (``Partnership Agreement'')will provide that the Partnership will have at least a 50% vote to: (a)Amend the Local Partnership agreement; (b) dissolve the Local Partnership;(c) remove the local general partner and elect a replacement; and (d) approveor disapprove the sale of substantially all of the assets of such LocalPartnership. In addition, the Partnership will require that the Local Partnershipagreements provide to the limited partners of the Local Partnerships substantiallyall of the rights required by Section VII of the guidelines adopted bythe North American Securities Administrators Association, Inc. (``NASAA'').4. The Partnership filed a registration statement under the SecuritiesAct of 1933 for the sale of units (``Units'') at $5,000 per Unit. EachUnit consists of two limited partnership interests (``Limited PartnershipInterests'') and one warrant (``Warrant'') granting an investor the rightto purchase one additional limited partnership interest (``Additional LimitedPartnership Interest'') between January 1, 1990 and January 31, 1990. Ifthe prescribed minimum number of subscriptions have not been met, no Unitswill be sold and funds paid by subscribers will be returned promptly, togetherwith a pro rata share of any interest earned thereon. The Partnership willnot admit any subscribers as limited partners (``Limited Partners'') tothe Partnership until the exemptive order applied for herein is grantedor the Partnership receives an opinion of counsel that it is exempt fromregistration under the 1940 Act. In the event that any of the Warrantsare not exercised, the Partnership may sell the related Additional LimitedPartnership Interests to other Qualified Investors (defined herein). Purchasersof the Units and Additional Limited Partnership Interests will become LimitedPartners of the Partnership. The Warrants are not detachable from the LimitedPartnership Interests at any time, and neither the Units nor the Warrantsare transferable. The Partnership Agreement also imposes certain restrictionson transfer and assignment of the Limited Partnership Interests, includingthat each proposed assignee must deliver to the General Partner evidenceof his suitability. The Partnership will not redeem or repurchase Unitsor Limited Partnership Interests, does not anticipate formation of a publicmarket for the Units or Limited Partnership Interests, and thus believespurchases of Units should be considered illiquid investments.5. Subscriptions for Units must be approved by the General Partner andPaineWebber Incorporated (``Selling Agent''). Each subscriber must representthat he meets the following general investor suitability standards (``QualifiedInvestor''): (a) In the case of corporate investors that are closely heldbut are not personal service corporations, corporations subject to SubchapterS of the Code, and C Corporations that are not closely held and are notpersonal service corporations, such corporations reasonably expect formost of the next ten years to have substantial unsheltered income againstwhich the Tax Credits from the Partnership can be utilized; or (b) in thecase of noncorporate investors, such investors reasonably expect to havean annual adjusted gross income of $200,000 or less or to have substantialunsheltered passive activity income for 1989 and each of at least the nextten years in which the Tax Credits are expected to be available, and either(i) has a net worth (exclusive of home, furnishings, and automobiles) ofat least $30,000 and an annual gross income of not less than $30,000 inthe current year, (ii) has a net worth (exclusive of home, furnishings,and personal automobiles) of at least $75,000, or (iii) is purchasing ina fiduciary capacity for a person meeting the requirements set forth inclause (i) or (ii). Certain states may impose additional or alternativestandards, but in no event shall the Partnership employ any suitabilitystandard less restrictive than that set forth above. 6. Although the Partnership will be controlled by its General Partner,certain significant actions cannot be taken by the General Partner withoutthe express consent of a majority in interest of the Limited Partners.Such actions include: (a) The sale at any one time of all or substantiallyall of the assets of the Partnership, except for (i) a liquidating saleof a final Local Partnership interest remaining after the sale of all otherLocal Partnership interests, or (ii) sales in connection with the liquidationand winding up of the Partnership's business upon its dissolution; (b)dissolution of the Partnership; and (c) the admission of a successor oradditional General Partner. Also, the majority in interest of the LimitedPartners will have the right to amend the Partnership Agreement (subjectto certain limitations), dissolve the Partnership, and remove any GeneralPartner and elect a replacement therefor. In addition, each Limited Partneris entitled to review at any and all reasonable times all books and recordsof the Partnership and of the Local Partnerships. 7. PaineWebber T.C., Inc., an Affiliate (as defined in the PartnershipAgreement) of the Selling Agent, will serve as the special limited partnerof the Partnership (``Special Limited Partner''). The Special Limited Partnerand the General Partner will each have the right to appoint three of thesix members of the Partnership's investment committee, which must approvecertain of the Partnership's investment decisions. The Special LimitedPartner will also have the right to remove, and appoint a substitute for,the General Partner under certain limited circumstances. The Special LimitedPartner will provide consulting services to the General Partner for theadministration of the Partnership's affairs. 8. The General Partner and its Affiliates will receive from the Partnershipreimbursement of organizational and offering expenses and an allowancefor wholesaling expenses. The Selling Agent will receive customary commissions,an investment banking fee on the sale of the Units, and a marketing fee.The Selling Agent may authorize other members of the National Associationof Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'') to sell Units, and may reallow themcommissions. These selling commissions and fees are customarily chargedin securities offerings of this type and are consistent with the NASD guidelines.Acquisition phase fees payable to all persons for the acquisition of interestsin Local Partnerships will be limited by the guidelines adopted by NASAA.The Partnership may pay additional fees or compensation to the GeneralPartner, the Special Limited Partner, or their Affiliates, and they mayreceive amounts from Local Partnerships to the extent permitted by applicablelaw and regulations. All such fees and amounts shall be subject to theterms of the Partnership Agreement. The General Partner also will be allocatedgenerally 1% of cash flow and 1% of the Tax Credits received by the Partnership,and compensation in various forms will be paid to the general partner ofeach Local Partnership. 9. All proceeds of the public offering of Units and Additional LimitedPartnership Interests (other than those issued upon exercise of the Warrants)will initially be placed in an escrow account with United States TrustCo. of New York (``Escrow Agent''). Pending release of the proceeds tothe Partnership, the Escrow Agent will deposit escrowed funds in interestbearing accounts which will be limited to (a) bank money accounts withthe Escrow Agent that are fully segregated and fully covered by federaldeposit insurance, (b) short-term certificates of deposit issued by a UnitedStates Bank having a net worth of at least $50 million, and (c) short-termsecurities issued or guaranteed by the United States government. Upon receiptof the prescribed minimum number of subscriptions, funds in escrow willbe released to the Partnership and held in trust pending investment inLocal Partnerships or Apartment Complexes. Any net proceeds not immediatelyutilized to acquire Local Partnership interests or for other Partnershippurposes (such as the establishment of a reserve) may be invested in permittedinterim investments, which include: (a) Readily marketable securities issuedby states or municipalities within the United States or agencies or subdivisionsthereof rated in the highest rating category by a nationally recognizedstatistical rating organization (``NRSRO''); (b) direct obligations of,or obligations unconditionally guaranteed by, the United States governmentor any agency thereof; (c) commercial paper issued by any corporation organizedand doing business under the laws of the United States or any state thereofrated in the highest category by a NRSRO; (d) certificates of deposit orEurodollar certificates of deposit issued by any bank whose deposits arefederally insured and which have a combined capital and surplus of notless than $100 million (or, in the case of Eurodollar certificates of deposit,a branch of any such bank); (e) collateralized repurchase agreements withdomestic banks whose deposits are federally insured and which have a combinedcapital and surplus of not less than $100 million having a duration nolonger than 60 days (or any extension or renewal thereof for a period notexceeding the period of the initial agreement) with respect to or securedby any of the types of securities specified in clauses (a) through (c)above; and (f) shares of any open-end investment company, as defined inthe 1940 Act, which has assets of not less than $200 million and investsprimarily in securities of the type enumerated in clauses (a) through (e)above or banker's acceptances; provided, however, that if the value of``investment securities'' (as defined in the 1940 Act and which term shallnot include the value of the Local Partnership interests) exceeds 40% ofthe value of the Partnership's total assets (exclusive of government securities,as defined in the 1940 Act, and cash items) at any time, such excess maybe invested only in government securities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Applicants' Legal Conclusions </ITAG>1. The exemption of the Partnership from all provisions of the 1940 Actis both necessary and appropriate in the public interest, because: (a)Investment in low and moderate income housing in accordance with nationalpolicy is not economically suitable for private investors without the taxand organizational advantages of the limited partnership form; (b) thelimited partnership form insulates each Limited Partner from personal liability,limits his financial risk to his investment, and allows him to claim hisproportionate share of the Tax Credits, income, and losses from the investment;and (c) the limited partnership form of organization is incompatible withfundamental provisions of the 1940 Act. 2. Investment Company Act Release No. 8456 (Aug. 9, 1974) lists two conditions,designed for the protection of investors, which must be satisfied in orderto qualify for the type of exemptive relief which the Partnership seeks:(a) ``Interests in the issuer should be sold only to persons for whom investmentsin limited profit, essentially tax-shelter, investments would not be unsuitable* * *;'' and (b) ``requirements for fair dealing by the general partnerof the issuer with the limited partners of the issuer should be includedin the basic organizational documents of the company.'' The Partnershipwill comply with these conditions and will otherwise operate in a mannerdesigned to insure investor protection. Interests in the Partnership willbe sold only to, and transfers will be permitted only to, investors whomeet specified suitability standards. The Limited Partners are adequatelyprotected through disclosure in the Partnership's Prospectus of all potentialconflicts with the General Partners, the Special Limited Partner, and theirAffiliates. The Partnership will file with the SEC and distribute to investorscertain financial documents and reports on its activities. Also, the GeneralPartner and its Affiliates agree in the Partnership Agreement that eachGeneral Partner and its Affiliate (excepting such Affiliates that are publiclyor privately syndicated limited partnerships) will not undertake an equityinvestment which could be suitable for the Partnership unless (a) the Partnershipdoes not have funds available to consummate the transaction on a timelybasis, or (b) the Partnership has declined to enter into such investment(with Affiliates that are publicly or privately syndicated limited partnershipsbeing able to undertake such an investment only under certain circumstancesthat have been limited to protect the interests of the Limited Partners).In addition, the Partnership will not acquire Apartment Complexes froma prior partnership affiliated with the General Partner unless certainconditions are met that are designed to protect the interests of the LimitedPartners and ensure that the terms of the transaction are fair to the Partnership.Limited Partners are further protected by the numerous provisions of thePartnership Agreement designed to prevent over-reaching by the GeneralPartner and to assure fair dealing by the General Partner vis-a-vis theLimited Partners. 3. The substantial fees and other forms of compensation that will be paidto the General Partner, the Special Limited Partner, and their Affiliateswill not have been negotiated through arm's-length negotiations. Applicantsconclude, however, that the terms of all such compensation will be fairand no less favorable to the Partnership than would be the case if suchterms had been negotiated with independent third parties. In addition,all compensation to be paid to the General Partner and its Affiliates isspecified in the Partnership Agreement and the Partnership's Prospectusand no compensation will be payable to the General Partner or any of itsAffiliates not so specified. Further, the Partnership believes that suchcompensation meets all applicable guidelines of the various states in whichthe Units and the Additional Limited Partnership Interests will be offeredand sold and with the statement of policy adopted by NASAA applicable toreal estate programs in the form of limited partnerships. 4. The contemplated arrangement of the Partnership is not susceptible toabuses of the sort the 1940 Act was designed to remedy. The suitabilitystandards described above, the requirements for fair dealing provided bythe Partnership's governing instruments, and pertinent governmental regulationsimposed on each Local Partnership by various federal, state and local agencies,provide protection to investors in Units comparable to and in some respectsgreater than that provided by the 1940 Act. An exemption would thereforebe entirely consistent with the protection of investors and the purposesand policies of the 1940 Act. 5. Applicants acknowledge that the order requested from the SEC appliesin a prospective manner only and they will not rely on such order withrespect to any activities, investments or commitments by them prior tothe date of the order.<ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, underdelegated authority. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
