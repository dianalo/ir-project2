(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim Bakker and a former top PTL aidedefrauded 150,000 contributors and used more than $4 million incontributions to the TV ministry to support extravagant lifestyles,an indictment charges.   Two other Bakker aides also were indicted for alleged tax evasion.   Bakker and Richard Dortch, PTL's former senior executive vicepresident, used fraudulent means to sell lifetime partnerships inthe ministry's Heritage USA theme park, a federal grand jury saidMonday after a 15-month investigation.   A lawyer for the television evangelist said today that Bakkerwill plead innocent.   Bakker ``has indicated he is wholly comfortable with thehonorable character of the way Heritage USA was operated under hisleadership and desires to see its ministry restored and continue,''his attorney, Jim Toms, said in a telephone interview from hisHendersonville office.   ``They're written in pretty complex language,'' he said of thecharges. ``It's going to take some real careful study to understandthe implications.''   Bakker, who founded the ministry in 1972 and built it into one ofthe nation's most popular evangelical enterprises, and Dortch arecharged with eight counts of mail fraud, 15 counts of wire fraud andone count of conspiring to commit mail and wire fraud for using themails, telephones and television.   If convicted of all the charges, Bakker, 48, and Dortch, 57, eachcould be sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined $6 million.   Bakker's wife, Tammy, a target of the investigation, was notindicted.   Bakker left the ministry in March 1987 after admitting to a 1980sexual encounter with church secretary Jessica Hahn. The indictmentalleges that Dortch authorized a $265,000 payment to Ms. Hahn tokeep her quiet about the incident.   Bakker's attorneys, Toms and Ryan Hovis, told reporters Mondaythat Bakker would not have a statement for several days.   ``Certainly there's a degree of discouragement or regret thatcriminal charges were brought against Mr. Bakker,'' Toms said. ``Buthe's glad to know what he's facing, so he can prepare his defense.''   Dortch told reporters in Clearwater, Fla., where he runs aministry called Life Challenges, that he looked forward to beingable ``to tell my side of the story and to put this matter behind meand with God's help I know that I can face the future.''   U.S. Attorney Thomas Ashcraft declined to comment, saying,``There has already been too much publicity on this already and wedon't want any more.''   Ms. Hahn, who works for a radio station in Phoenix, told a newsconference she is willing to testify in court, but otherwise wantsnothing to do with the case.   ``I have lived with this for eight years,'' she said. ``I refuseto be a slave to this any longer.''   Two months after Bakker left PTL, his Pentecostal denomination,the Assemblies of God, dismissed him and Dortch.   According to the indictment, the Bakkers received bonusestotaling $3,465,000 from 1984 through 1987, and Dortch got bonusestotaling $550,000 although they were aware PTL was in poor financialcondition.   The Bakkers returned to the Charlotte area in June, mounting anunsuccessful attempt to buy PTL, which filed for bankruptcyreorganization three months after Bakker left the ministry.   A U.S. Bankruptcy Court has been trying to find a suitable buyerfor PTL's 1,700 acres of undeveloped property, satellite televisionnetwork and Heritage USA theme park in Fort Mill, S.C, just over theNorth Carolina line.   The indictment said Bakker and Dortch raised at least $158million from the lifetime partnerships sold to finance constructionof a hotel at the theme park. PTL sold the partnerships from 1984until spring 1987, promising free yearly lodging at the theme parkin return for a one-time gift, usually $1,000.   More than 152,000 partnerships were sold.   The indictment said Bakker and Dortch oversold thosepartnerships, didn't tell partners about it and misled PTL boardmembers about the ministry's finances.   Also indicted Monday were David Taggart, a former PTL vicepresident, and his brother, James, a former interior designer forPTL. They are accused of diverting more than $1.1 million in PTLmoney for their own use, including $55,000 in purchases from theCartier jewelry store in New York, and not reporting the income tothe Internal Revenue Service.   The defendants were ordered to appear Dec. 15 in U.S. DistrictCourt.   The maximum penalty for each count of mail fraud, wire fraud,conspiracy and tax evasion is five years in prison and a $250,000fine and five years.   On Nov. 10, the Bakkers and David Taggart were ordered by afederal judge in Columbia, S.C., to repay nearly $7.7 million to PTLas restitution for excessive pay and benefits they received between1984 and 1987.   The Bakkers were ordered to repay $6.6 million of that. Bakker'sattorneys have said they will appeal the decision.</TEXT></DOC>
