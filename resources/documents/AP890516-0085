The boards of Oglivy and WPP Group PLC announced early todaythey had approved the buyout under which the London-based WPP willpay $54 a share in cash for all of Ogilvy's common stock.   The agreement came just hours before today's annual meeting ofOgilvy shareholders.   ``While we would have preferred to remain independent andpursued many options to that end, we became convinced that acombination with WPP represented the most attractive course for thefuture of our organization,'' said Ogilvy's chairman, Kenneth Roman.   But he said after intensive conversations, he concluded the dealoffered the best course for the company and its shareholders.   Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP Group, said he's certainthe combination ``will create the finest advertising and marketingservices group in the world.''   At a news conference this morning, Roman and Sorrell said theywould keep the Ogilvy and Thompson agencies autonomous. Roman saidsome Ogilvy clients told him they'd like to discuss how the agencywill be run under the WPP umbrella but none threatened to drop theagency as a result of the deal.   Sorrell said he first thought about the possibility of acquiringOgilvy after meeting with Roman in April 1988, but that it tooknearly a year to decide to make a firm proposal.   Sorrell began his pursuit of Ogilvy only 2{ weeks ago when heproposed a buyout at $45 a share.   Roman said Ogilvy preferred to remain independent and that itsboard would consider the offer in due course.   On May 8, WPP said it had proposed to pay $50 a share for Ogilvystock. Four days later Ogilvy said it had entered into formaldiscussions with WPP after the latter indicated it would be willingto increase its offer from $50 a share in order to secure afriendly agreement.   The agreement would allow the New York-based Ogilvy Group tooperate autonomously within WPP, a fast-growing conglomeration ofadvertising agencies, public relations and marketing servicesconcerns.   Roman will continue to head the Ogilvy operations within WPP.   In an added inducement, WPP said it would appoint Ogilvy founderDavid Ogilvy chairman of WPP Group. The current WPP chairman, JohnSymonds, will become deputy chairman.   Only two years ago, WPP stunned the advertising world with itsuninvited but successful buyout of the parent of another U.S.advertising giant, J. Walter Thompson. That deal had cost $566million.   The combination of WPP and Ogilvy will produce an advertisingand marketing services giant that would have had combined billingsin 1988 of about $13.5 billion.   That would put it only slightly behind the industry leader,London-based Saatchi andamp; Saatchi PLC, which had billings of just over$13.5 billion in 1988, according to the trade magazine AdvertisingAge.   Sorrell said he intended to pay for the acquisition by raisingabout $350 million through an issue of convertible preferred stock.The rest would come from bank loans.   Ogilvy, founded in 1948, is one of the better known names in theadvertising business. Its Ogilvy andamp; Mather ad agency has manyblue-chip clients including American Express Co., AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and Sears, Roebuck and Co.</TEXT></DOC>
