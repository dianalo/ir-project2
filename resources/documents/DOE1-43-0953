<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-43-0953 </DOCNO><TEXT>We report on a case of multiple hepatic abscesses in an immunodeficientpatient where initial radiologic evaluation by ultrasonography and computedtomography confused early management by failing to demonstrate the abscessesand by suggesting other diagnoses. Indium 111 (In-111) white blood cell(WBC) scanning with Tc-99 liver-spleen scan subtraction accurately demonstratedsubcapsular hepatic abscesses in four out of four sequential studies,and later confirmed resolution of the abscesses. We suggest that In-111WBC scanning may be used as a highly specific method of diagnosing suspectedupper abdominal abscesses in children.</TEXT></DOC>
