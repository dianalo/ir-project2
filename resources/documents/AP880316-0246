Poindexter was accused of lying to the House and Senateintelligence committees on Nov. 21, 1986, by saying he did notlearn about the November 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles to Iranuntil three months later.   The indictment also charges that Poindexter, a computer buff,deleted from the NSC computer system all stored messages that hehad sent or received.   Poindexter and North are also charged with lying to Housecommittees in the summer of 1986 by falsely stating that North wasnot helping raise money for the Contras or providing militaryadvice to the rebels.   The obstruction and false statement charges against North andPoindexter each carry five-year sentences and a $250,000 fine.   After a full day of deliberations, Walsh was called to the grandjury room at 3:54 p.m. and told the panel was ready to return anindictment. The 21 members of the grand jury then filed upstairs toa courtroom where the 101-page indictment was formally returned toU.S. Magistrate Jean Dwyer.   The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell, 77,who was appointed by President Johnson and presided over one of theWatergate trials.   Last week, Poindexter's predecessor as national securityadviser, Robert C. McFarlane, pleaded guilty to four misdemeanorcharges that he withheld information from Congress in 1985 and in1986 by denying that members of his staff, particularly North, werehelping raise private money to arm the Contras during the Contraaid ban.   The indictment also charged North with obstructing theindependent counsel's investigation of the security system at hisGreat Falls, Va., home by creating false documents to conceal thefact that Secord had paid $16,000 for it installation. He wascharged with illegally accepting the security system as a gratuity.   The indictment also charged that North pocketed $4,500 of$90,000 in travelers checks that he received from Contra leaderAdolfo Calero to cover expenses related to the rebel cause and theefforts to obtain release U.S. hostages in Lebanon.   In a statement, Hakim's lawyer, N. Richard Janis, said: ``Webelieve strongly that Mr. Hakim has committed no crimes and thatths indictment is unfair and unwarranted.''   Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, who chaired the SenateIran-Contra committee, said, he believed ``justice will ultimatelybe done.''   ``While I personally remain convinced that they exhibitedinsufficient sensitivity to the rule of law, and to the fact thatunder our system of government the Congress makes the laws, we mustawait the verdict of a jury of their peers as to whether thisinsensitivity was criminal in nature,'' Inouye said.   But Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, another member of the Senate panelwho was one of the administration's strongest supporters during thecongressional hearings, said the investigation was ``a colossalembarrassment to our whole government.''   ``It's going to be a very tricky trial to try to prove thesecharges in an open forum,'' Hatch told reporters.   ``I'm not white-washing this. There were serious mistakes madehere,'' Hatch said.   Last spring, two conservative fund-raisers, Carl R. ``Spitz''Channell and Richard Miller, pleaded guilty to felony charges thatthey conspired with North to illegally use a tax-exempt foundationto raise $3.2 million for the Contras.   The indictment also charged North with participating in thatconspiracy.</TEXT></DOC>
