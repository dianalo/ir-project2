A small temperature rise in the right-hand engine turned on thefire-warning light during Monday's flight, the airline said. As aresult, the pilot shut down the engine as the plane approachedLondon's Heathrow Airport.   Flight 391 from Brussels landed safely, powered only by theleft-hand engine, the spokeswoman said.   Engineers found no incorrect wiring or other faults in theright-hand engine, the spokeswoman said. She said the cause of thetemperature increase was unknown.   Authorities ordered a check of wiring in several types ofaircraft after a Boeing 737 crashed last month in central Englandand killed 47 people. The crash, whose cause in still underinvestigation, led to speculation that a warning light could haveled the pilot to unnecessarily shut off an engine.</TEXT></DOC>
