Police said at least three dozen shells fired from Syrianpositions in and near Moslem west Beirut hit the coast aroundByblos, an ancient port 20 miles north of the capital.   No casualties or serious damage were reported from the shelling,intended to prevent ships from delivering arms and food to the 1million Christians besieged in their 310-square-mile enclave northand east of Beirut.   Syrian forces have continued bombarding the coast north of thecity despite a cease-fire called May 11 by the Arab League, whichbegan a summit Tuesday in Casablanca.   Christian military units, as well as the Syrians and Drusemilitiamen allied with them, were reported to be resupplyingartillery and rocket batteries in preparation for a renewal ofmajor fighting.   ``No one's making a secret of it,'' a police spokesman said.   A Christian official said: ``The atmosphere is one ofpreparation for a major outbreak of fighting.''   Syria has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under a 1976 peacekeepingmandate from the Arab League and has become the main power brokerin the chaos of a 14-year-old civil war.   The latest fighting began March 8, two days after Gen. MichelAoun's Christian army units blockaded illegal ports run by Moslemmilitias. Druse militiamen led by Walid Jumblatt responded withartillery fire and Syrian gunners soon joined them.   A mediation committee from the Arab League has been trying tostop the fighting, which police say has killed at least 359 peopleand wounded nearly 1,400, almost all of them civilians.   Syria pledged to observe the truce on land but said its forceswould continue shelling the Christian coast to prevent resupply bysea.   In recent days, Syrian gunboats operating from Tripoli innorthern Lebanon have turned back at least one ship _ a freighterbound for the Christian enclave with a cargo of food.   Christians say they have been able to land three shiploads ofammunition and food by using small boats to ferry the suppliesashore at night from cargo vessels anchored several miles out.   Iraq has supplied arms to the Christians since a cease-fire Aug.20 in its 8-year-old war with Iran. Iraq and Syria, which supportedIran in the war, are enemies of long standing.   On Monday and Tuesday, the Syrians were seen moving more than 60truckloads of ammunition from the Bekaa Valley in east Lebanon toartillery and rocket positions in west Beirut.   Soldiers unloaded howitzer shells, rockets and mortar roundsfrom dozens of trucks along beaches near the airport, where most ofSyria's heavy weapons are deployed.   Aoun and his allies of the Lebanese Forces, the main Christianmilitia, also were trucking ammunition to artillery emplacements. AChristian source said food, drinking water and fuel were beingstockpiled.   In west Beirut and other Syrian-controlled areas, civilians werebuying up canned food, bottled water and fuel in expectations ofhaving to spend days in underground bunkers. Shops and bankssandbagged entrances and windows.   Lebanon's seat at the summit is vacant because other Arabnations do not recognize either of the rival governments set upwhen President Amin Gemayel's term ended in September andParliament could not agree on a successor.   Gemayel, also a Christian, named Aoun to lead the government butMoslems rejected the army commander and swore allegiance to SalimHoss, the premier under Gemayel.   Soon after that the army also split into Christian and Moslemcommands, with Aoun leading the 20,000 Christians and Maj. Gen.Sami Khatib in charge of the 22,000 Moslems.   Under an unwritten agreement since independence from France in1943, Lebanon's president is Christian, the premier Sunni Moslemand the parliament speaker Shiite Moslem.</TEXT></DOC>
