The 160 nucleotides5' to the cap site direct low-level expression in hepatoma cells, andsequences between -520 and -160 bp upstream of the RNA start site functionedas a cell-specific enhancer of expression both with the {alpha}1-antitrypsinpromoter and when combined with a functional {Beta}-globin promoter.Within the enhancer region, three binding sites for proteins presentin hepatoma nuclear extracts were identified. The location of each sitewas positioned, using both methylation protection and methylation interferenceexperiments. Each protein-binding site correlated with a functionallyimportant region necessary for full enhancer activity. These experimentsdemonstrated a complex arrangement of regulatory elements comprisingthe {alpha}1-antitrypsin enhancer. Significant qualitative differencesexist between the findings presented here and the cis-acting elementsoperative in regulating expression of the human {alpha}1-antitrypsingene.</TEXT></DOC>
