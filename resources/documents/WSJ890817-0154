The maker of computer products said it was informed of the potential suit by U.S. attorneys after the federal General Services Administration completed a review of pricing of federal contracts awarded to the company for the two-year period ended Sept. 30, 1985. In a letter, the federal attorneys told the company the suit would seek about $520,000 in damages, which the government might seek to treble, and penalties of up to $10,000 for each of at least 386 company invoices submitted to the government, Data Translation said.    The U.S. attorneys invited the company to enter into settlement negotiations, the company added. The U.S. attorneys couldn't be reached for comment.    Data Translation asserted that it has &quot;meritorious defenses&quot; in the matter and that any liabilities arising from the dispute won't have a material effect on the company's finances. A company spokesman said the dispute arose from the government's contention that the company &quot;didn't show the level of discounts on volume purchases {the government} could have had.&quot; He added that the company &quot;will sit down&quot; with federal officials &quot;and try to resolve this.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
