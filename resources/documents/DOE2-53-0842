Yet many of the effects of human-induced climatic changesare still poorly understood. Major alterations in regional hydrologiccycles and subsequent changes in regional water availability may be themost important effects of such climatic changes. Unfortunately, theseare among the least well-understood impact. Water-balance modeling techniqueswere developed and tested for a major watershed in northern Californiausing climate-change scenarios from general circulation models and hypotheticalscenarios. Results of this research suggest strongly that plausible changesin temperature and precipitation caused by increases in atmospheric trace-gasconcentrations could have major impact on both the timing and magnitudeof runoff and soil moisture in important agricultural areas. Of particularimportance are predicted patterns of summer soil-moisture drying thatare consistent across the entire range of tested scenarios. In addition,consistent changes were observed in the timing of runoff. These hydrologicresults raise the possibility of major environmental and socioeconomicdifficulties and they will have significant implications for future water-resourceplanning and management.</TEXT></DOC>
