(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Fallen evangelists Jim and Tammy Bakkersaid today they're preparing to submit a plan to the PTL'sbankruptcy trustee that will provide for them to go back ontelevision.   The couple, who returned to South Carolina at the end of Mayintent on regaining control of the ministry Bakker founded,admitted they don't have money to buy air time or to purchase PTL'sassets.   But Bakker said he had promises of support from some businessesin Rock Hill and Fort Mill, near PTL's Heritage USA headquarters.He wouldn't provide names.   ``We are preparing in the next 48 hours a plan to present to Mr.(M.C.) Benton and that would include air time and quite a bitelse,'' Bakker said in a news conference at the offices of aColumbia law firm.   ``We don't have money in the bank. We haven't asked for peopleto put money in the bank. We will launch a campaign, perhaps in thenext few days, to do some of that,'' he said.   Mrs. Bakker, who underwent treatment for an addiction toprescription drugs before the couple's March 1987 departure fromthe ministry, said she has not used drugs to cope with stress sincetheir fall from PTL.   ``I haven't had a pill in a year and five months!'' she said.   On Thursday, Bakker met in Winston-Salem, N.C., with Benton ashis former church, the Assemblies of God, announced that hisrequest for a meeting with church elders had been denied.   After his meeting with Bakker, Benton said he told Bakker thatif his presence proved disruptive at Heritage USA, the trusteewould ``really lay down the law with him.''   ``I explained to him that he has a big following of people andwherever he goes he draws a crowd,'' Benton said. ``Crowds can bedisruptive and I'm just not going to allow that to happen atHeritage USA. We're going to have to do things in an orderlyfashion.''   The former Winston-Salem mayor said he will place norestrictions on Bakker's visits to the religious theme park ``aslong as he conducts himself like a gentleman and doesn't cause anyproblems for us.''   Bakker lost his Assemblies ministerial credentials last year andcontrol of his multimillion-dollar evangelical complex after his1980 tryst with former church secretary Jessica Hahn became public.   Assemblies of God spokeswoman Juleen Turnage said Thursday inSpringfield, Mo., that Bakker's request for a meeting with churchleaders was considered and rejected by the Executive Presbytery,which met Tuesday through Thursday.   Bakker wrote in April asking to meet with Assemblies leaders,but did not say why, according to Mrs. Turnage. He would have towait two years before requesting an appeal of his dismissal, shesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
