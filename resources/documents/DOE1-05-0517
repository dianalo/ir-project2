Contrast enhancement of IADSAwas superior or equivalent to that of conventional angiography. IADSAwas useful in visualizing the pancreatic vessel overlapping the vertebralbody. It was in particular helpful in visualizing the venous brancheswithin the pancreas, providing a clue to the diagnosis of small pancreaticcancer. However, conventional angiography seems to remain the techniqueof choice for the visualization of the peripheral branches. (Namekawa,K.).</TEXT></DOC>
