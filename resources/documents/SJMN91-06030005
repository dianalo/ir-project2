He stars in&quot;Queens Logic,&quot; the Feb. 1 big-screen platform release that was made for lessthan $10 million -- and recently completed the $7 million &quot;Homicide&quot; featurefor David Mamet. He says it makes no difference to him what a movie costs.&quot;The only difference is the perks. On a small picture, there won't be lavishcatered meals or limousines or stuff, but all that really matters is thequality of the project. I would have made 'Godfather III' if it had cost $2million instead of $50 million or $60 million.&quot;  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SMALL BUDGETS CAN SUIT MANTEGNA, TOO  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  The Grapevine  </MEMO><TEXT>     &quot;Queens Logic&quot; came about, he says, because he and co-star John Malkovich'are friends of the producers, and were quick to commit to the tale about agroup of childhood buddies who reunite in their old Queens neighborhood.
