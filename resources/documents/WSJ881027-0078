The Physicians for Social Responsibility requested that the commission be appointed to assess the health and environmental impact of the production of nuclear weapons. The panel would be similar to the commission that reviewed the Challenger space shuttle accident.    Four of the major weapons sites are currently closed down, primarily because of safety concerns. Until a review by experts outside the Energy Department is completed, the group said, those facilities shouldn't be reopened. &quot;We need outside accountability,&quot; said H. Jack Geiger, a past president of the organization.    In recent weeks, disclosure of the Energy Department's poor management of the weapons program at sites around the country has prompted several environmental and government watchdog groups to call for comprehensive reviews of the facilities.    The physicians group also said it will seek Energy Department records outlining the radiation exposure of the 300,000 workers at the sites. The department has rejected such requests in the past. </TEXT></DOC>
