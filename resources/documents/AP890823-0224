Rather than go hog-wild when building a new store, Passscrutinizes the cost of everything from cages to cash registers.   The enormous interest payments that go with leveraged buyouts,takeover deals that rely on borrowed money, have hurt a number ofhighly visible companies, from drug chains to truckers to furnitureoutlets.   But as Pass Pets Ltd.'s experience shows, a lower-profile crop ofpost-buyout firms is flourishing, partly because the high debtlevels force management to cut unnecessary spending.   Pass says the relentless pressure of a multimillion-dollar debton the 35-store chain, headquartered near St. Louis, has made him abetter manager. He wouldn't disclose the exact amount of money owed,but said ``I've got to make those interest payments.''   Moreover, Pass said he's unafraid of a recession, unlike manymanagers of heavily indebted companies who worry that a downturncould shrink their income, delay debt repayments and bring angrycreditors knocking.   ``The pet business can jump 25 percent in a recession,'' he said.``People don't send their kids to camp _ they stay home with theirpets.''   A small percentage of the nation's LBO debt has been repaiddelinquently or not at all, and some finance experts forecast thatLBO failures may rise sharply.   Federal Reserve Board vice chairman Manuel Johnson, for example,said in a June speech that about 40 percent of all debt-financeddeals are in cyclical industries that could face severe problems ifthe economy shrinks.   The troubles that LBO companies face when they can't repaycreditors first began receiving heightened attention more than ayear ago. Revco D.S. Inc., one of the largest drug store chains,sought bankruptcy protection at that time because of inability topay the debt incurred in its $1.3 billion LBO.   Other high-profile LBOs such as the $1.1 billion buyout of SingerCo., $2.5 billion buyout of Storer Communications Inc. and $3.7billion of Owens-Illinois Inc. also have faced difficulty managingtheir heavy debt loads.   But some experts argue that many LBO companies can pay debtspromptly and make money. Steven Kaplan, assistant professor at theUniversity of Chicago, said the ``companies that can't make debtpayments get a lot of press.''   Kaplan said that in his study of more than 50 LBOs completedbetween 1975 and 1985, the companies experienced an average jump inoperating income of 10 percent and a 2.6 percent increase inprofitability, both exceeding the averages by non-LBO competitors.   An LBO has become one of the most popular corporate takeovertools of the decade. Figures compiled by IDD Information ServicesMandamp;A Database, a securities industry research concern, show the valueof LBOs completed in 1989 already totals $49.48 billion, vs. about$16 billion for LBOs completed in 1984.   In such a transaction, a group of investors that often includescompany management buys a company largely with borrowed money, usingits assets as collateral for the loans.   The investors repay the loans with the company's earnings or thesale of what they consider unnecessary assets or operations, rangingfrom corporate jets to inefficent factories or entire subsidiaries.   The results often are drastically shrunken but highly profitable,privately owned companies that don't have to worry about the demandsof public shareholders and can concentrate instead on theirlong-term businesses.   Such companies can be resold later for an enormous profit becausethe LBO investors put up little of their own money. Most of the riskis borne by creditors who finance the LBOs.   Experts say LBO success depends upon a company having reliablestreams of incoming cash, steady demand for its products and assetsthat maintain value regardless of economic swings. That's why someLBOs don't make it.   One example is Cuisinarts Inc., which earlier this month soughtChapter 11 bankruptcy protection because of stagnant demand for itsupscale food processors and a failure to exploit its famous name onother products. Debt stemming from the company's 1988 LBO was justone problem.   Other companies likely to encounter difficulties are those thatundertook management-led LBOs mainly to escape a hostile takeover.   Among the casualties is trailer maker Fruehauf Corp., forced tosell most of its businesses to help pay for a $1.5 billion LBO thatthwarted an unwanted bid by takeover investor Asher Edelman. Littleis left of the original Fruehauf, now known as K-H Corp.   Problems also arise when deals are ``priced on the bet that thebest case is going to materialize _ it's never happened,'' said AlRappaport, chairman of Chicago-based consulting firm Alcar Group Inc.   LBO specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., generallyconsidered the pioneer of the strategy and engineer of the record$25 billion LBO of RJR Nabisco Inc. earlier this year, reportedlyfaces difficulties unloading some businesses acquired in several ofit debt-financed takeovers.   In addition, some companies Kohlberg helped acquire via LBOs arefoundering. New York-based Seaman's Furniture Co., for example, hassaid it must renegotiate debt payments, partly because sales havestagnated. The $360 million LBO engineered two years ago presumedhealthy sales growth.   Despite the difficulties faced by some of high-profile LBOs, manyothers are considered mundane transactions that do not hinge on themass sale of assets or other drastic restructuring.   Rappaport said more than 80 percent of LBOs undertaken between1986 and 1988 were divestitures, meaning that management boughtdivisions from the parent company that could be run more efficientlyas separate businesses. Such deals have been widely successful.   Take O.M. Scott andamp; Sons Co., an Ohio fertilizer maker thatconglomerate ITT Corp. sold to a management-led group in a 1986 LBO.In the past two years, sales have risen by 35 percent, operatingprofit has jumped 50 percent, and the company has repaid 20 percentof its debt load.   The case of Pass Pets also is relatively common: an entrepreneurwants to sell the company he founded but still retain a stake in thebusiness.   After grooming his pet chain for 20 years, Pass sold a majoritystake to Horizon Investments, an LBO investment firm, and kept hisposition as president and minority owner. Horizon purchased itsstake with borrowed money.   Such an arrangement, Pass said, allowed him to ``have my companyand get my money out. I got a job, my company and cash.''   Still, as manager he is responsible for repaying the LBO debt.Getting used to that was difficult for Pass, who called it ``a newway of doing business.''   August Ceradini saw an LBO as a way of buying a company withother people's money. His yacht charter business has adebt-to-equity ratio of 5-to-1 but he's having no problem paying theinterest.   ``We have a good growth rate and good control of costs,'' saidCeradini, president of New York Cruise Lines Inc. The company wascreated when a Manhattan sightseeing ship company completed an LBOof World Yacht Inc., which runs dinner-dance cruises around New Yorkharbor.   Despite the pressure of interest payments, Ceradini is unafraidof recession. ``Every restaurant in New York is down 20 percent, andwe're ahead of last year. Good food and good service doesn't wearout, and neither does a spectacular view of the city.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday Aug 27</NOTE></DOC>
