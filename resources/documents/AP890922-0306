On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the November contract forWest Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil,dropped 34 cents to finish the week at $19.28 a barrel. Contractsfor later delivery posted similar losses.   With the exception of the front-month unleaded gasoline contract,refined products also slipped.   Unleaded gasoline for October delivery inched up .09 cent to61.95 cents a gallon. The contract had gained 4.19 cents in theprevious two sessions after news that a big refinery in the U.S.Virgin Islands was severely damaged by Hurricane Hugo.   Heating oil for October delivery declined .61 cent to close at56.97 cents a gallon.   The refinery on St. Croix, Virgin Islands, owned by Amerada HessCorp., supplies markets mainly in the eastern United States. Thefacility, with a capacity of 545,000 barrels, had been turning outabout 400,000 barrels a day of gasoline, distillates and otherrefined oil products before the storm.   Amerada Hess has said the refinery would resume partialoperations in about 30 days and full operations in 60 days.   A company spokesman said Friday that officials would continue toassess the damage over the weekend.   ``We will have a better fix on things next week,'' said thespokesman, who asked not to be identified. ``I think we're prettyconfident that we can do it in 60 days.''   The official said Amerada also had storage terminals inCharleston, S.C., that sustained minor damage from the samehurricane as it moved northward.   Damage to the refinery caused a normal weakening of crude prices,analysts said.   ``The shutdown of the refinery puts more crude back on themarketplace,'' said Richard Redoglio, energy broker with MerrillLynch Energy Futures.   In addition, the OPEC meeting this weekend added some jittersthat helped dampen prices, traders said.   ``People are taking profits and liquidating positions in advanceof the meeting,'' Redoglio said.   The meeting of OPEC's eight-member monitoring committee beginsSaturday in Geneva. Analysts said investors are acting cautiouslyalthough no substantial changes are expected to emerge from themeeting.</TEXT></DOC>
