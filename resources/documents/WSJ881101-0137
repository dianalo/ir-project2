The country's communist guerrilla movement is on the offensive again, and U.S.-based protest groups have resurrected a propaganda blitz.    &quot;U.S.-Out-of-El Salvador&quot; posters have reappeared in New York City's subways, protesters led by Daniel Ellsberg tried to block Pentagon entrances recently for the benefit of TV cameras, and church-sponsored &quot;study groups&quot; are featuring guest Salvadoran guerrillas.    The guerrillas have set off terror bombs in San Salvador and launched at least one rocket attack against a U.S. aid installation. Meanwhile most of the U.S.-based offensive is being led as usual by the Committee in Solidarity With the People of El Salvador (CISPES), which has worked on behalf of the Salvadoran guerrilla movement over the years that the issue has flared through American politics.    This military and propaganda offensive is taking place just as the guerrillas are losing popular support. The population, grown tired of abuse from both the guerrillas and a failing economy, is increasingly convinced that socialism -- whether the hard-core Marxist variety or the more traditional version offered by the current elected president, Jose Napoleon Duarte -- doesn't work.    As the result of a legislative election held on March 20, universally acknowledged to have been free and fair, the free-market Arena Party now holds a majority of seats in the constituent assembly. With this elected majority, Arena has tried to liberalize Salvador's largely statist economy with market-opening legislation and efforts to lower taxes. These have been vetoed by President Duarte. Now, however, Arena stands a very good chance of winning next March's presidential election. The party's candidate is not the controversial Roberto d'Aubuisson. It is instead a widely respected businessman named Alfredo Christiani, who has been building popularity throughout the country. Mr. Duarte's Christian Democrats are badly divided, and the political arm of the guerrilla movement has decided to participate in the election, though it's expected to pull just a fraction of the vote.    Politically motivated killings in El Salvador do seem to be on the rise, but the numbers are nowhere near as high as some groups claim. A Washington Post dispatch in late August noted that &quot;. . . it is often difficult to tell which side is responsible for death squad-style murders.&quot; Moreover, the Post reported, &quot;Government officials are not the only victims of the rebels' summary 'justice.' Also killed on occasion have been coffee farm workers, people who defy transport strikes, members who quit the movement and peasants who resist paying 'war taxes.'&quot; What seems evident is that the culture of political killings continues to carry its usual political response.    It is hardly surprising that the guerrillas' offensive and the U.S. propaganda efforts on their behalf are occurring at a time when the people of Salvador have begun to reject conclusively the methods and the goals of the left. In those Latin American countries where people have been given the opportunity to make their choices freely, most have chosen to entrust their future to the politics of the ballot box. </TEXT></DOC>
