RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court, in a defeat for unions,ruled Tuesday that railroads and airlines may penalize strikers bygiving their jobs to employees with less seniority who stay on thejob or return to work before the strike ends.   The 6-3 decision was described by the dissenters as ``inherentlydestructive of the right to strike'' but defended by the court'smajority as a lawful exercise of an employer's power.   The court ruled that Trans World Airlines legitimately exercisedits ``peaceful economic power'' when it refused to rehire thousandsof striking flight attendants after the walkout ended.   Many of the jobs went instead to flight attendants who remainedat work or abandoned the strike to return to work. Those employeesare called ``cross-overs'' for crossing the picket line.   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the court, said TWA hadthe right to retain cross-overs just as it has the power to hire newemployees to replace striking workers.   ``That this decision had the effect of encouraging pre-strikeworkers to remain on the job during the strike or to abandon thestrike and return to work before all vacancies were filled was aneffect of the exercise of TWA's peaceful economic power,'' she said.   Rex Hardesty, spokesman for the AFL-CIO here, expressed regretover the ruling but added, ``We have to live it.''   Mona Zeiberg, a lawyer for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said,``It's a positive ruling for business.''   The decision was based on an interpretation of the federalRailway Labor Act, which governs airlines as well as railroads.   While it does not apply directly to other industries, O'Connorsaid most employers have enjoyed the same power since a 1938 SupremeCourt ruling.   She said the court then interpreted the National Labor RelationsAct to allow employers to give strikers' jobs permanently to workerswho did not honor the strike.   Justice William J. Brennan, in a dissenting opinion, disputedO'Connor's understanding of the 51-year-old ruling.   He said the 1938 decision applied only to workers hired fromoutside the company.   Since that ruling, he said, ``It has been accepted that anemployer may hire permanent replacements ...(who) need not bedisplaced to make room for returning strikers.''   But he said the 1938 decision has not been applied before now to``members of the striking bargaining unit who have crossed thepicket lines.''   Tuesday's ruling ``is inherently destructive of the right tostrike as guaranteed by the Railway Labor Act and the National LaborRelations Act,'' Brennan said.   The case stems from a dispute between TWA and the IndependentFederation of Flight Attendants (IFFA). The flight attendants'three-year contract expired July 31, 1984, and the union called astrike on March 7, 1986, when negotiations failed.   TWA hired more than 2,350 new flight attendants and traineesafter the strike began. In addition, some 1,280 TWA flightattendants crossed picket lines either at the outset of the walkoutor as the strike continued for more than two months.   After the strike ended, the union filed a federal lawsuitcharging TWA with illegally refusing to reinstate most of the 5,000striking workers who stayed out the two months.   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 1987 that strikingflight attendants were entitled to their old jobs at the expense ofless senior flight attendants who had crossed the picket lines.   The flight attendants hired during the strike were allowed tokeep their new jobs and were not affected by that ruling orTuesday's decision that reversed the 8th Circuit court ruling.   O'Connor said preferential treatment for cross-overs does notviolate seniority protections because workers who stayed out onstrike but were reinstated after the walkout ended retain theirseniority rights over cross-overs with less seniority.   She was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and JusticesByron R. White, John Paul Stevens, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M.Kennedy. Besides Brennan, the other dissenters were JusticesThurgood Marshall and Harry A. Blackmun.   The Supreme Court, in a 4-4 ruling a year ago in another casestemming from the TWA strike, held that an airline may be forced tocontinue collecting union dues from workers after its contract withthe employees has expired.   TWA had sought to discontinue the dues check-off after the strikeended. The Supreme Court's tie vote upheld a lower court ruling thatthe airline may not cancel the check-off provision unless it isagreed to in negotiations with the workers.</TEXT></DOC>
