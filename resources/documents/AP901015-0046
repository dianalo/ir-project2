The dollar closed at 128.15 yen, down 1.15 yen from Friday'sclose of 129.30 yen. It opened at 128.55 yen and ranged between127.95 and 128.72.   The dollar's closing was its lowest since 127.63 yen on March 6,1989.   ``The dollar has become less attractive because of growingpessimism over the U.S. economic performance,'' said a MitsubishiBank dealer, speaking on condition of anonymity.   Early dollar-selling in Tokyo followed the U.S. currency'sdecline in the Sydney market, which opens earlier than Tokyo's,dealers said.   ``First the yen soared against the Australian dollar in earlytrading, triggered by the Australian central bank's announcement itwould lower interest rates,'' said Mamoru Tabata, a dealer with theMitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank.   ``The (U.S.) dolla  will quickly fall further once it breaks the128-yen line, which is a resistance point,'' Tabata added.   Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno told a news conference,however, that the market sees little possibility of the dollarplunging. He said the U.S. currency's recent sharp drop has beentoo fast.   Mieno also said there had been unavoidable stock price declinesreflecting a correction of the ``bubble effect'' of asset prices.The Tokyo market's leading index has declined this year from arecord high exceeding 38,900 points at the end of 1989.   But on the stock exchange today, the 225-issue Nikkei StockAverage surged 719.04 points, or 3.21 percent, closing at23,109.20. The index fell 195.47 points Friday.   Traders said the yen's strength, stability in bond prices andrelative calm in the Persian Gulf region contributed to today'ssurge in the Nikkei.   They said, however, that trading was thin, with many investorssitting on the sidelines. First section volume was estimated at 350million shares, up slightly from last Friday's 320 million.   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-yeargovernment bonds was 83.40 points at 5 p.m., up from Friday's83.35-point close.
