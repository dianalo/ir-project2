Thomson, Aerospatiale and MBB declined to outline theirplans before a news conference scheduled for tomorrow. Butofficials familiar with the plans say Thomson, Europe'sbiggest defense electronics concern, will take the place ofrival Matra S.A. in certain projects with Aerospatiale andMBB.</LP><TEXT>   Until recently, Matra was working with Aerospatiale andMBB on a new surface-to-air missile, and officials of the twoFrench companies say that project now has been dropped.Unable to build strong ties to Thomson, Aerospatiale hadsought to merge its missile activities with Matra's. ButMatra, which isn't government-owned, insisted on keeping itsindependence.   The Thomson-Aerospatiale-MBB alliance marks a shift forThomson, which has been hurt by shrinking defense business.While Aerospatiale has been eager to build ties with Thomson,and while both companies are controlled by the Frenchgovernment, Thomson has resisted getting too close toAerospatiale; it has sought foreign partners instead.   Thomson produces the electronics that go into missiles,and it needs a partner, such as Aerospatiale, to build themissile body. Recently, Thomson was planning to merge itsmissile activities with those of British Aerospace PLC. Thatplan, which Thomson said would have created the world'slargest missile-maker, was canceled in March.   A Matra official said the company's airborne Apachemissile will continue to be produced jointly withAerospatiale.</TEXT></DOC>
