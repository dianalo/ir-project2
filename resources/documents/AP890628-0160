(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The remnants of Tropical Storm Allisonflooded hundreds of homes Wednesday in southern Louisiana andwhipped up tornado-force winds that injured five people inMississippi.   Almost 10 inches of rain fell in the Baton Rouge area Tuesdaynight and Wednesday morning and 3 to 6 inches more rain was expected.   ``I don't know what to expect. This is the most rain that'sfallen in this short a period of time that I can remember,'' saidRalph Stassi, 50-year-old chief deputy of the Iberville ParishSheriff's Office in Plaquemine, south of Baton Rouge.   Allison came ashore Monday in Texas and was blamed for fourdeaths in that state. More than a foot of rain fell in some spotsand authorities estimated damages could approach $1 billion in theHouston area alone.   Louisiana and Mississippi continued to take a pounding from whatwas left of the storm Wednesday while Texas began to dry out.   Creeks and bayous rose throughout the day. Several were alreadyabove flood stage in Louisiana by mid-afternoon and authorities toldpeople near the Calcasieu, Whisky Chitto and Mermentau rivers aswell as Bayou Nezpique to prepare to move to higher ground.   Several communities reported flooded homes. Plaquemine was one ofthe hardest hit with as many as 280 homes flooded. Two trailer parkswere evacuated, Iberville Parish officials said.   In Baton Rouge, flash flooding was reported in several areas oftown. In one subdivision near the Louisiana State University campus,2 to 3 feet of water covered some streets and homeowners wadedthrough their living rooms.   Edward Wright, assistant director of emergency management for thecity-parish government in Baton Rouge, said at least 100 homes wereflooded.   ``Our drainage system is not the best,'' said Wright, ``and thatmuch rain in that short a period of time really tests it.''   Power failures were reported in several areas, including the LSUcampus, where classes were canceled.   In Mississippi, several homes were damaged or destroyed whentornado-force winds ripped into the Centreville area, authoritiessaid. Five people were injured but not seriously, said a spokesmanat Field Memorial Hospital said.   Before the tornado destroyed a house next door, ``We wereremarking on how strange the weather looked,'' said Sue Havard,co-owner of Rollins Timber Co. just outside the Centreville citylimits. ``Instead of the leaves being blown down, they were beingsucked up into the air.''   In Amite County, Miss., authorities said an apparent tornadostruck southwest of Liberty, damaging farm buildings and a house ata dairy farm. No injuries were reported.   On Tuesday, the storm, downgraded to a tropical depression, spunoff tornadoes in opposite corners of Louisiana. In the morning, thetown of Hackberry in southwestern Louisiana was hit and two mobilehomes were overturned. Eight funnel clouds were sighted aroundMonroe in northeastern Louisiana and homes along a 100-mile pathwere damaged but no serious injuries were reported.   In Texas, dozens of families along the San Jacinto River east ofHouston remained out of their flooded homes Wednesday. In addition,many side roads, particularly in the eastern part of the city andHarris County, remained flooded.   The storm also caused considerable beach erosion _ perhaps 20 to30 yards _ on the west end of Galveston Island and on the BolivarPeninsula across from Galveston, where sand dunes were pushed over ahighway, weather officials said.   Several rivers in eastern Texas remained over flood stage.   Allison became the first named storm of the 1989 Atlantichurricane season when its highest sustained wind speed reached 39mph. The National Weather Service said the highest gusts clockedwere 56 mph at Galveston and 53 mph at Houston IntercontinentalAirport.</TEXT></DOC>
