Prosper Avril, the latest Haitian president, stands a good chance of succeeding where his two predecessors -- Lt.-Gen. Henry Namphy and political science professor Leslie Manigat -- failed. Gen. Avril may even lead Haiti on the path to democracy if he can withstand the temptation to which so many Haitian leaders before him have succumbed: the lure of life-presidency or the attempt to go beyond one's appointed time.    During a recent two-hour interview, I reminded the 50-year-old general of a conversation we had some 2 1/2 years ago. At that time, it was obvious that Gen. Avril was disappointed with Gen. Namphy, who headed the first post-Duvalier government. &quot;If you were the general,&quot; I asked then-Col. Avril, &quot;what would you do differently.&quot; He shot back: &quot;There are a few Ton Ton Macoutes thugs on the loose causing trouble, and who will cause more trouble in the future. I would hang 'em. . . . And we would have peace in the land.&quot;    I was stunned by his words. &quot;You would really hang them?&quot; I exclaimed. &quot;Perhaps not literally, but I would definitely get rid of them,&quot; he answered.    Now, more than two years later, sitting under the almond trees by his swimming pool in the cool hills of the fashionable suburb of Petionville, Gen. Avril was in control of the government. &quot;This time we are meeting under better circumstances,&quot; he said. Speaking in the presence of his foreign minister, former classmate Serge Elie Charles, the general had not forgotten his old suggestion. &quot;I must disarm the Ton Ton Macoutes thugs if we're going to have free elections in this land,&quot; he said. He went on to pledge his support for democracy: &quot;I am a missionary. My mission is to save the country, to establish a durable, irreversible democracy and to step down.&quot;    The Sept. 17 coup that placed Gen. Avril in power apparently was undertaken by non-commissioned officers of the Palace Guard. Other non-commissioned officers followed the lead of the Palace Guardsmen and took upon themselves to dismiss many high-ranking officers accused of crimes, corruption or maltreatment of the citizens. Many a colonel was handcuffed, at times stripped to his underwear, and dumped on the porch of army headquarters in Port-au-Prince. Some of these officers were behind last Sunday's unsuccessful coup.    Gen. Avril believes in the military hierarchy, but he feels that the army must be controlled. He emphasized that the soldiers may have had grievances against specific officers &quot;who acted badly toward the people. But they didn't demand that (military) ranks be leveled.&quot;    To strengthen the military, the general recently commissioned 49 non-coms, rewarding those who participated in the latest upheaval that rid the army of many undesirable characters, including those army officers with ties to drug traffickers. Meanwhile, notorious Ton Ton Macoutes leaders have either skipped the country, gone into hiding or taken refuge in foreign embassies in Haiti.    The most infamous of these is former army colonel and Port-au-Prince mayor Franck Romain. He is now holed up at the Dominican Republic's embassy in Petionville. The Avril government has provided safe-conduct papers to Mr. Romain's family, but has refused to furnish such documents to Mr. Romain. Gen. Avril's government is under popular pressure not to facilitate the escape of Mr. Romain, who is accused of heinous crimes. The worst crime associated with him is a massacre this past Sept. 11 of more than a dozen parishioners at a Roman Catholic church in Port-au-Prince. A group of Mr. Romain's city hall toughs applauded the action on national television the next day.    Some government officials now assert that Gen. Namphy allied himself with Mr. Romain, thinking that for silencing a radical priest he would be applauded by an anti-Communist administration in Washington. Perhaps then financial aid, blocked by the U.S., would have been resumed. (Washington cut off some $70 million in government-to-government assistance to protest the Nov. 29, 1987, massacre of voters in line to participate in the first free national election since the collapse of the Duvalier dynasty.)    Resumption of U.S. aid is also Gen. Avril's top priority. The country &quot;can't get out of the deep (economic) hole in which it finds itself unless the aid embargo is lifted,&quot; said the Haitian chief. Canada, France, West Germany and Venezuela have also cut Haitian aid. And Haiti, whose current yearly imports bill runs to about $75 million, has only one month of reserves to pay for basics such as petroleum products and wheat.    Gen. Avril scoffs at those, including his predecessor, who assert that &quot;Haiti doesn't need foreigners.&quot; Already suffering from staggering unemployment, Haiti lost about 15,000 light assembly jobs in the past two years. No investment has been made in those two years, and none is forthcoming. As the former liaison between Jean-Claude Duvalier and Haiti's banking community, Gen. Avril knows well the importance of private investment and has the support of Haiti's private bankers.    Concerning relief aid, Gen. Avril has been joined by Haiti's powerful Catholic bishops. The Bishops Conference recently issued a statement asking international organizations for special consideration for Haiti. &quot;In present circumstances we urgently call on you to intensify your aid for the development of the country,&quot; the bishops said.    Despite all the entreaties, Gen. Avril is facing a skeptical U.S. Congress, which has tied U.S. aid to a resumption of the democratic process. Haiti's case thus becomes a quandary. &quot;I can't say I am going to have elections in six months, 12, 18 or 22 months,&quot; said Gen. Avril, &quot;until we bring some measure of economic stability to the country.&quot; But U.S. legislators remember that they had doubled -- to more than $100 million -- the aid to Haiti for the promise that Gen. Namphy would usher in an era of democracy. &quot;After that lesson we're going to be very cautious,&quot; said Rep. Walter E. Fauntroy (D., D.C.) in a telephone interview. Mr. Fauntroy is chairman of the Congressional Task Force on Haiti.    Nevertheless, Gen. Avril already has surprised observers by adopting an attitude of openness unusual by Haitian standards. Visitors to the presidential palace have included groups as diverse as private bankers and members of the Communist Party. In a greater gesture of conciliation, Gen. Avril has appointed a prominent opposition leader, Francois Benoit, as the next ambassador to the U.S. Several members of Mr. Benoit's family were slaughtered by &quot;Papa Doc&quot; Duvalier in 1963.    &quot;I am not Henry Namphy,&quot; he says. &quot;I have given proof of where I want to take this country. I am for free, honest elections, and to that end I want the speedy establishment of an independent electoral council. It's obvious to all that I am for a free flow of ideas. I am listening to all our leaders. We've lost more than two years. It's time for us to trust each other.&quot;    ---   Mr. Joseph, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, is co-publisher and chief editor of The Haiti-Observateur, a Brooklyn-based Haitian weekly. </TEXT></DOC>
