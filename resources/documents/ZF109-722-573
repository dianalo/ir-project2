 It's simply an interim strategy for networkintegrators to provide centralized internetworking management.andP;  CMIP will bethe standard for network management in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)age.andM;SNMP has become popular because it's available now and, as the name states,it's simple.andM;How SNMP worksandM;Three components exist in an SNMP implementation:andM;* Network agents--devices to be managed, such as routers and bridges;andM;* Network management stations (NMS)--host computers that manage the network;andM;* The SNMP protocol itself--a specification that describes not only how theagents and managers communicate but also what types of information they canexchange.andM;Agents, which must include SNMP agent software, monitor network information(e.g.andP;  number of connections, speed of transmissions) at their specificlocations.andP;  NMSes, which must include SNMP management software, poll andrequest information from the agents, collect it in a database and translatethe messages into a format that can be viewed by the network administrator.andO;NMSes feature graphical user interfaces (GUIs), but SNMP doesn't dictate anyspecific GUI.andM;SNMP allows administrators to monitor and analyze networks and to isolatefaults.andM;SNMP is actually a protocol suite consisting of three specifications:andM;* RFC 1157--the SNMP;andM;* RFC 1156 and 1158--the management information base (MIB);andM;* RFC 1155--the structure of management information (SMI).andM;The management information base defines the kinds ofinformation--variables--that vendors must implement to be SNMP-compliant.andO;The base MIB defines only the minimum (about 100) set of variables.andP;  Thevariables include such information as the number of packets transmitted,number of errors, last connection opened and closed.andM;Each agent device includes an MIB; each NMS includes a database that containsall MIB variables.andM;MIB information is either device-specific or device-independent.andP;  Vendors canadd information to the base MIB to differentiate their products.andP;  Theseadditions are referrd to as enterprise branches, enterprise extensions orproprietary extensions.andM;Although adding vendor-specific extensions to the MIB gives SNMP morefunctionality, it may create incompatibility problems.andP;  To overcome theseproblems, the Internet Activities Board's (IAB) Internet Engineering TaskForce is adding elements to the base MIB.andP;  And vendors are forming alliancesto make sure that their products interoperate.andP;  (The Internet is a worldwideinternetwork based on TCP/IP protocols; the IAB monitors standards for theTCP/IP community.)andM;RFC 1156 is a document that defines the original MIB, which is called MIB-1.andO;The MIB-2, which is defined in the RFC 1158 document, has added variables toand is backward-compatible with MIB-1.andM;The SMI defines the structure and language for organizing all the SNMPnetwork-management information.andP;  All network-management information and SNMPcontrols must be represented in one of the forms defined in the SMIspecification.andM;It's possible to manage non-SNMP devices or networks with an SNMP manager.andO;This is accomplished by installing proxy agents in the non-SNMP device orLAN.andP;  Proxy agents are usually developed by third parties.andP;  They are mostuseful when you have a proprietary network-management protocol (e.g.andP;  IBMCorp.'s NetView) and you want to use those protocols in an SNMP-managedenvironment.andP;  The proxy agent translates proprietary protocols intoSNMP-readable protocols.andM;The IAB in 1988 endorsed SNMP as the standard network-management protocol fortransmission control protocol/internet protocol (TCP/IP) netorks.andM;TRW, ULANA and SNMPandM;Systems integrators are giving SNMP mixed reviews.andP;  Most large integratorshave little experience with SNMP.andP;  Other large integrators are pinning theirnetwork-management strategies on it.andM;For example: TRW Inc.'s Information Networks Division (IND) is using SNMP inmany of its TCP/IP-over-Ethernet integration projects, including the U.S.andO;Air Force's massive Unified Local Area Network Architecture (ULANA) project.andM;Why SNMP?andP;  &quot;We considered CMIP,&quot; says Joseph Aro, TRW IND marketing manager,&quot;but SNMP is here today.andP;  A lot of software is available.andP;  It's just a caseof implementing it.&quot;andP;  TRW IND is putting SNMP agent software in its ownterminal servers, PC add-in boards and network bridges.andM;More than 50 companies sell SNMP-compliant products (see vendor list at endof article).andP;  At the Interop '90 show (October, San Jose), most of thosecompanies exhibited SNMP interoperability in a show-wide demonstration.andM;In practice, interoperability is not so easy.andP;  &quot;Compatibility between SNMPproducts is a problem,&quot; says Dave Passmor, a partner with Ernst andamp; Young'sFairfax, VA Network Consulting Division, &quot;Each vendor has extended thestandard MIB.andP;  Consequently, the management station requires somecustomization; you have to add to the tables.&quot;andM;In a recent survey by Datapro Research, a Delran, NJ, market-research firm,25 percent of the respondents said that the biggest problem with SNMP was thedifficulty in supporting private MIB extensions.andP;  Respondents to the surveywere predominantly Fortune 1000 companies.andM;Kevin Wyant, marketing manager at Technology Concepts Inc., a systemsintegration company specializing in networking, says that as long as you useSNMP products from a single vendor, there will be no interoperabilityproblems.andP;  &quot;If the products are from different vendors, our customers tell usthat there can be interoperability problems.andP;  It's not as smooth as thevendors would like you to think,&quot; says Wyant.andM;Some integrators combine the SNMP and CMIP protocols.andP;  Example: ComputerSciences Corp. (CSC) is building a huge (as many as 5,000 sites)network-management system for a government agency using both SNMP and CMIP.andM;&quot;SNMP is a fine short-term solution,&quot; says Hassan Dastvar, an executive staffmember at CSC.andP;  &quot;In the long term, CMIP is the anser for network-managementsystem problems.&quot;andM;Mix the protocolsandM;To accommodate both protocols, CSC put SNMP and CMIP engines in the networkmanager.andP;  The network-management application interfaces with either module,depending on the protocol (SNMP or CMIP) in the agent device.andP;  The managerrecognizes which protocol the agent device is using, based on the device'saddress.andM;Although CSC rolled its wn dual-protocol solution, the industry is working onsolutions that allow the two protocols to interoperate.andP;  Most of this work isbeing performed by the OSI Network Management Forum and the Internet SNMPCouncil.andM;CSC's network-management system manages mostly routers and bridges.andP;  Althoughthe company is also building an X.25 gateway, it has not determined whetherit will be SNMP or CMIP-managed.andM;Most SNMP implementations run on TCP/IP-over-Ethernet because SNMP is basedon the TCP/IP protocol suite.andP;  CSC's network, in contrast, runs OSI protocolsand is Government OSI Profile- (GOSIP) compliant.andM;SNMP goes to schoolandM;CIMI Corp., a systems integration and consulting company, has been involvedwith a handful of SNMP-based network-management jobs.andP;  One such projectinvolved a university that recently won a federal government researchcontract.andP;  The project required linking up to the TCP/IP-based Internetnetwork.andP;  The logical choice for network management was SNMP.andM;The university uses SNMP to manage a gateway that links the campus to theInternet.andP;  SNMP manages the routers that connect four campus buildings.andP;  Alldevices are managed from a single NMS console.andM;SNMP implementations are mostly limited to three areas:andM;* Beta sites in which SNMP is being tested.andM;* University and research institutions that are hooked up to the Internetnetwork--this is the most prevalent environment for SNMP-based networkmanagement.andM;* Commercial local area networks (LANs) based on TCP/IP protocols.andM;Commercial implementations of SNMP are much less prevalent than universityand research implementations.andP;  Thomas Nolle, president of CIMI, estimatesthat the number of commercial users of TCP/IP-SNMP is about one-third toone-fifth the number of university-Internet users of TCP/IP-SNMP.andO;&quot;Commercial users are used to PC LANs, which are managed by the seat of yourpants,&quot; says Nolle.andM;A few drawbacks to SNMP account for its limited use:andM;* SNMP relies on a datagram service, usually the User Datagram Protocol (UDP)for management-information exchange.andP;  CMIP uses OSI transport, session andpresentation-level connections.andP;  The advantage of datagrams is that the UDPtransport mechanism is much easier to implement than the complex CMIP scheme.andO;The disadvantage is that datagrams don't provide delivery assurance.andO;Management messages may arrive out of sequence, or you may wind up losing orduplicating messages.andM;* SNMP's biggest advantage, relative to CMIP, is at the same time its biggestdisadvantage.andP;  &quot;CMIP gives you much more management information than SNMP,&quot;says CSC's Dastvar.andM;CIMI's Nolle echoes Dastvar's comment: &quot;SNMP is not as versatile as CMIP, andit's not aspplicable to as broad a range of network products.&quot;andP;  Although SNMPcan manage almost any type of intelligent network device, currently it's usedpredominantly to manage routers.andM;The implementation of SNMP is so simple that some end-users don't require theexpertise of systems integrators.andP;  For example, TEchnology Concepts has notbeen involved with any SNMP projects, but Wyant yet claims that many of hiscustomers have already implemented SNMP.andM;&quot;Our customers are implementing SNMP themselves,&quot; says Wyant.andP;  &quot;It's fairlystraightforward because you can get SNMP products directly from equipmentvendors.&quot;andP;  Like many systems integrators specializing in large-scalenetworking, Technology Concepts is more involved with OSI and CMIP than withSNMP.andM;SNMP vs.andP;  CMIPandM;Nolle speculates that, for systems integrators, the big network-managementissue is the standards race between SNMP and CMIP.andP;  &quot;Our primary work hasshifted to CMIP,&quot; says Nolle, who estimates that the network-managementprojects his company currently handles have a 2:1 split in favor of CMIP.andO;And Nolle expects that ratio to shift even more in the favor of CMIP in thenear future.andM;Despite CIMI's experience, many other integrators are concentrating on SNMPuntil CMIP matures.andP;  Ernst andamp; Young's Passmor says that his company'scustomers are far more interested in SNMP.andP;  &quot;There's still a lot more SNMPprojects than CMIP.andP;  It's premature for CMIP,&quot; he says.andM;Datapro's research supports Passmor's observation.andP;  In Datapro's SNMP survey,only 3 percent of the respondents said they would continue to support SNMPfor less than two years before converting to CMIP.andP;  More than half (53percent) said they would stick with SNMP for three years to five years, 13percent said six years to 10 years and 30 percent had no plans to migrate toCMIP.andM;CMIP didn't knock out SNMP in the early rounds because:andM;* CMIP is much more complex and harder to implement;andM;* The standards-setting method behind SNMP is much faster than theISO-governed methods for establishing CMIP stanards.andM;&quot;The Internet community is not as easily manipulated by market preferences,&quot;contends Nolle.andP;  &quot;With OSI, you have a much richer environment but you alsohave a much more difficult process of consensus.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
