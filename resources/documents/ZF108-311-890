 Note that I said proficiency, not wizardry.andO;You just have to be proficient to get a job and keep it.andP;  But being goodisn't enough if you want to call yourself a professional programmer.andM;What does it mean to be a professional?andP;  Webster's defines a professional asone who &quot;...of, engaged in, or worthy of the high standards of a profession.&quot;andO;Seems a simple definition.andP;  But by whose high standards should we ascomputing professionals be judged?andP;  In this column we'll examine how weapproach the business side of our profession and compare our own standards ofperformance to professionalism.andM;All professionals are responsible to themselves, to their client or employer,to the profession as a whole, and to society.andP;  Responsibility to youremployers or clients is clear enough: quid pro quo.andP;  You provide a service,they provide a paycheck.andP;  If you don't perform satisfactorily, you don't getpaid.andP;  It's that simple.andM;To recognize your responsibilities, you need to know what &quot;satisfactory&quot;means to your client or employer.andP;  When I evaluate employees, I look at twoside of their work: their specific job skills and how they fit in as part ofthe team.andP;  Everyone isn't expected to be a star player; but what is expectedof you?andM;The service you provide, be it design or code, must be quality work.andP;  Qualityis subjective, and it's up to you to find out what's expected.andP;  You are alsojudged by your productivity--a quantitative measure.andP;  Through carefulcommunication, you need to establish a balance between quality and quantity.andM;I have a client who is anxious to have a customized billing application bythe end of the fiscal year.andP;  Before giving me the contract, however, shewants to wait for more information from local agencies.andP;  My responsibility asa professional is to inform her that by waiting, we are forced to evaluatepriorities.andP;  My personal standard of quality is not negotiable.andP;  We need todecide whether to delay the project, proceed without the information, orreduce the scope of work.andM;This example demonstrates one of the most difficult responsibilities for anyprogramming professional: the ability to plan, organize, and prioritizeprojects so they can be completed on time.andP;  The delayed release of Lotus1-2-3 demonstrates how difficult it is to keep development projects undercontrol.andP;  If major software development companies can't plan their projects,how can we?andP;  I could write an entire column on effective project planningmethods (and I may), but being aware of the difficulty of scheduling anycreative process solves half the problem.andP;  Don't give your client or employerunrealistic time estimates based on a best-case scenario--be realistic inevaluating your abilities.andP;  No one benefits by unrealistic schedules, noteven the marketing department.andM;It almost goes without saying that you're expected to know what you're doing.andO;But knowing about programming and software design isn't enough.andP;  John Young,CEO of Hewlett-Packard, observed in the keynote address at the XI WorldComputer Congress that, &quot;...the service industries that have invested mostheavily in computing technology are the ones with the very worstproductivity.&quot;andP;  As an information services professional, you are expected toprovide opinions based on your expertise.andP;  Just as a faster computer isn'tthe solution to a poorly chosen algorithm, automation may not be the answerto a business problem.andP;  The only way you can express an educated opinion isto know the computing industry and the business of your client or employer.andM;Doing nothing is as bad as doing something negative.andP;  How many bad jokes didyou have to put up with when ex-Cornell grad student Robert Morris, Jr.andP;  wasindicted by the U.S.andP;  Justice Dept.andP;  for planting the Internet worm?andP;  I don'tthink I need to tell you what a spectacle like that does for the profession'sreputation.andP;  One obvious thing you can do to help your profession is tobehave ethically in your search for personal creative freedom.andM;Major news stories like the Internet worm or the Hannover hacker are only oneside of our profession's shady image.andP;  Is it less of a scandal that ourprofession has no standard curriculum for academic study?andP;  A degree incomputer science is currently almost meaningless in business.andP;  Many shopslook to hire data-processing personnel with degrees in a related technicalfield and a few programming courses under their belt.andP;  In fact, many&quot;professional&quot; programmers are self-taught hackers without degrees.andP;  This isnot to say that these non-computer-science graduates can't be professionalprogrammers, but it doesn't say much for pursuing an education in computerscience.andP;  If we as computer professionals don't trust academia to producegood programmers, why should anyone?andM;It's also scandalous that we don't need to be licensed to practice.andP;  Thereshould be a way to develop and maintain the integrity of professionalprogrammers.andP;  One way to do this is to establish a licensing body to assurethat programmers are qualified.andP;  Consider that software is the cornerstone ofour national defense system.andP;  A corporate personnel director recentlydescribed the type of data-processing staff sought as, &quot;...the businessdegree with a computer-science minor, if we get it.andP;  Business skills are moreimportant than technical skills, which we can teach ourselves.andP;  We onlyrequire that candidates have one COBOL course.andP;  Then we put them through asix-weeks training course, and they receive additional training as their jobrequires it.&quot; (1)  One COBOL course and we unleash these programmers to writeapplications that control our bank accounts, credit histories, medicalprocedures, space exploration, and defense systems.andM;The programming profession does not have a standard academic course of study,a licensing system, or even generally accepted standards of practice.andP;  And wewonder why we have a shady reputation in some circles.andM;So, what can you do about these professional issues?andP;  Participate.andP;  Gettinginvolved in professional society activities in one step.andP;  The ACM and othersocieties are founded on volunteer effort--and it doesn't take much.andP;  Simplybeing a member is better than nothing; your membership dues help supportsociety activities.andP;  Attend local chapter meetings and let your voice beheard.andP;  If you can, take an active role by getting involved inspecial-interest groups or national-level committees.andP;  Professional societiesare set up to promote the exchange of information among specialists and thegeneral public.andP;  You will benefit by participating--and so will the entireprofession.andM;Another step you can take is to get certified.andP;  The only agency I know ofthat certifies information systems professionals is the Institute forCertification of Computer Professionals.andP;  The certification program coversentry-level to experienced programmers and is fairly comprehensive.andP;  Whilethis may not be equivalent to a license, it can lend credibility to ourprofession.andM;While no established standards of practice for programmers exist, you canstill rely on good sense.andP;  For now, set your own standards (or adopt someoneelse's), but work toward standards by which all can be judged.andP;  Whenexperimenting with a new paradigm, let it be just that -- an experiment.andO;Someone may actually use the program you're writing or designing; don'texperiment with their confidence.andM;Your responsibility to society overlaps your responsibility to yourprofession.andP;  If an engineer designs a bridge that falls down or a pumpingstation that explodes, that is a personal black mark on a professionalcareer.andP;  We hear, &quot;All software has bugs.&quot;andP;  That's not acceptable.andP;  TheInternet worm infiltrated UNIX systems throughout the network by takingadvantage of known bugs in the operating system.andP;  Those bugs, which allprograms have, allowed infection of over 2,000 computers that were uselessuntil disinfected.andP;  Affected programmers, scientists, secretaries andmanagers couldn't work for two days.andP;  But even worse than lost productivityis the loss of a sense of fair play critical to the operation of thesenetworks.andM;While the Internet worm affected large systems, even personal computing is nolonger an independent cottage industry.andP;  The entire structure of our societydepends on our ability to share information quickly and effectively.andP;  As theindustry grows, so does the need to understand how your keyboard messagingand searching forthe perfect sorting algorithm affect those outside theindustry.andP;  This goes back to the Golden Rule.andP;  You hope the programmersworking on defense projects are paying attention to what they're doing.andP;  Isyour own work any less important?andM;Quality is a continuing theme in all facets of a programmer's responsibility.andO;Yet quality is an ethereal attribute--difficult to quantity.andP;  Spend some timeevaluating yourself.andP;  Robert Pirsig's Zen and the Art of MotorcycleMaintenance [2] examines the definition of quality.andP;  If you haven't read it,do so.andP;  If you've read it before, read it again.andP;  You'll never achieveperfection, but one technique to improve the quality of your work is tostrive to improve.andM;But what about looking out for yourself?andP;  You have all these responsibilitiesto others; what do you owe yourself?andP;  We work in an exciting field full ofpossibilities.andP;  Take advantage of them.andP;  You owe it to yourself to consideryourself a student forever.andP;  Part of the excitement of our industry is howquickly it changes; stagnating in one operating system or hardware platformis almost certain professional suicide.andP;  Attending conferences, continuingyour education, reading everything you can keeps you fresh and involved.andO;Educating yourself also makes you a better programmer -- and more valuable.andM;Our profession includes elements of science: careful studies of situationsand analysis of relationships and results.andP;  We are also artists searching forcreative solutions to problems, new ways to display information, the elegantand graceful line of well-written code.andP;  At the same time we're tradespeople,using good tools and proven methods.andP;  I'm always amazed how many people inthe world don't want to program.andP;  You should enjoy your work and theenvironment in which you do it.andP;  If not, it's up to you to just yourexpectations or make changes.andP;  If you've always wanted to get down and dirtyand write operating systems but you're writing COBOL accounting procedures,change jobs.andP;  Take calculated risks to expand your options.andM;On the other hand, be reasonable about your expectations.andP;  If you want to goout on your own to write systems software, remember Bill Gates already hasMicrosoft; there's not much of a chance you'll corner the market on PCoperating systems.andP;  Setting realistic goals improvers your chances forsuccess.andM;I'm also amazed that people are willing to pay me for doing something I enjoyso much.andP;  But they are, and we each have agreements with our employers orclients about how much we deserve.andP;  Is it equitable?andP;  I my next column, we'lllook at the going rates for programming and how to decide if you're gettingwhat you deserve.andM;ReferencesandM;[1] Davis L. &quot;Can Education Meet IS Career Demands?andP;
