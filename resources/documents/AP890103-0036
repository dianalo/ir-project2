The problem of the nation's budget deficit looms as theoverriding test for Bush, but his aides also are looking to movelegislation on issues that Bush stressed during his campaign,including childcare, education, the environment and ethics.   The Bush team has said the budget deficit will take priority, andmuch of his legislative program will depend on the fiscal package heis able to work out with Congress.   ``We'd have to have the framework first for dealing with thebudget,'' said Craig Fuller, the Bush transition co-director.   But he said Bush will still pursue commitments he made during hiscampaign. That would mean legislative proposals in such areas asenvironment, childcare and education.   In the area of government ethics, where President Reagan vetoed apackage from Capitol Hill last fall, Bush said recently that he willsend an ethics bill to Congress ``very, very early.''   In his proposals on lobbying by government officials afterthey've left office, Bush applies the same standards to Congress asto executive branch workers, said Boyden Gray, who will serve asBush's White House legal counsel.   As his budget team toils over the the fiscal framework they willtake into congressional negotiations, small groups of aides areworking on that and other building blocks of the Bush agenda.   Research teams headed by Jim Pinkerton, head of policydevelopment for Bush's transition operation, have gathered data fromcabinet departments including synopses of measures pending inCongress and issues seen as key in the new congressional session.   Much of the ``serious policy analysis'' on the Bush legislativepackage is expected to occur early in January, said Robert Teeter,co-director of Bush's transition team.   The early proposals are expected to center on a domestic agenda,stressing the ``kinder, gentler'' approach to government that Bushdiscussed during the campaign.   Spending proposals _ such as his plan to expand Medicaid coverage_ ultimately will hinge on how the budget negotiations turn out. Forinstance, Bush's commitment to the tough anti-drug stance he tookduring the campaign could be tested in talks on financing themassive new anti-drug legislation Congress passed this fall.   The bill calls for $2.7 billion in new spending, but Congressinitially appropriated only $976 million.   But other items, such as the ethics package, don't have asignificant pricetag.   One idea is to stress presidential leadership on projects thatdon't involve large sums of money, such as an internationalconference Bush has proposed to deal with the problem of globalwarming of the atmosphere from carbon dioxide.   Bush wants a revised clean-air bill, and said in the campaign thenation must have ``a clear commitment to emissions reductions on aclear timetable.''   He said he will work with Congress ``on the exact amounts andexact methodology'' to reduce nitrogen oxide and sulpher dioxideemissions.   On one of the acid-rain sticking points, Bush proposes burdensharing of the costs among ratepayers nationwide rather than just inthe polluting regions.   The Clean Air Act has been up for renewal every year this decade,but Congress has been unable to agree on the provision dealing withacid rain.   ``There will be a long negotiation on acid rain and clean airauthorization,'' predicted Bush adviser Bob Grady.   Environmentalists also are waiting to see how the Bush teamhandles some of the regulatory aspects of environmental protectionand cleanup, a subject on which the Reagan administration washeavily criticized.   Another controversial topic is offshore oil drilling. Congress,in an ad hoc approach, has tacked on a drilling prohibition for theCalifornia coast, for example, when passing appropriations for theInterior Department each year.   Bush, a former oilman, has shied away from blanket bans, sayinghe will look at the drilling situation on a tract-by-tract basis.   Bush also emphasized education issues during the campaign. Hisproposals include a $500 million merit schools program, $50 millionfor magnet schools, and $50 million for programs in teaching reformand innovation.   He also promised to push for a big increase in Head Startfunding, to extend it to all eligible 4-year-olds.   Bush during the campaign pledged a childcare plan, to include agovernment refund for childcare expenses for the poor, with a $1,000tax credit per child under age 4.   Differences between Bush's childcare plan and versions offered byCongress are expected to spark a battle. The new president also willsend Congress his plan for YES, or Youth Entering Service toAmerica. It calls for $100 million to match private sector grantsfor young people to volunteer in community service programs.</TEXT></DOC>
