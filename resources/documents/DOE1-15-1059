<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-15-1059 </DOCNO><TEXT>Neutron activation analysis has become one of the most sensitive and selectiveanalytical technique for the determination of trace elements in a widevariety of matrices. Neutron activation involves the irradiation of thetest sample and a standard of the element to be determined with thermalneutrons in a reactor, followed by dissolution of the test sample, inthe presence of carrier of the element to be determined. The carrierand radioisotopes are separated from the bulk of other induced activitiesand then the activity induced in the sample is measured on a suitabledetector. The standard is treated identically. The advantages of themethod are discussed. (author) 4 refs.; 4 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
