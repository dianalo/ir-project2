For analyses of nuclear power plant events, approaches are presentedfor detecting malfunctions and degradations within the course of theevent. At the system level, approaches are investigated as a means ofdiagnosis of system level performance. This involves the detection ofdeviations from normal performance of the system. The input data analyzedare the measurable physical parameters, such as steam generator level,pressurizer water level, auxiliary feedwater flow, etc. The study providesthe methodology and illustrative examples based on data gathered fromsimulation of nuclear power plant transients and computer simulationof a plant system performance (due to lack of easily accessible operationaldata). Such an approach, once fully developed, can be used to explorestatistically the detection of failure trends and patterns and preventionof conditions with serious safety implications. 33 refs., 18 figs., 9tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
