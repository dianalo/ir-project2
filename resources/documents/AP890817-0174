MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In the old gag, the comedian answers thetelephone and listens for a moment. ``You don't say,'' he marvels.Then, ever more incredulous, ``You don't say ... You don't say.''   He hangs up. ``Who was it?'' asks the straight man.   ``He didn't say.''   Not saying is no joke with President Bush. His adroit use ofambiguity is becoming a trademark. It's a way to avoid answeringquestions he doesn't want to answer, or can't answer _ and a way tosend signals, political and diplomatic.   At his ``last day before vacation'' news conference, his 20th byWhite House count, Bush used the technique to respond without reallyanswering questions about U.S. hostages in Lebanon and possiblesteps to gain their freedom.   That is ambiguity with a purpose, combining an invitation to Iranto help get the hostages out and so foster better relations with ahint of possible reprisals, when and if the administration can finda way to punish terrorists without harming others.   ``... If I could find a way to take those hostages, get them andbring them out, and that required using the military force of theUnited States, make no mistake about it, I would do it in aninstant,'' Bush told his press conference on Tuesday. That was allconditional _ he said he hasn't found a way and doesn't know thatthere is one.   Nor was he saying what the United States might be prepared to dofor Iran were that nation to help free the hostages. ``Toohypothetical to answer,'' Bush said, ``but I would simply repeatthat we are looking for signs of change ... There are many ways thatcountries who are estranged can get back together.''   The goals are clear: freedom for the hostages and improvedrelations with Iran. The punishments and rewards that may beinvolved are intentionally vague; to spell them out in advance wouldbe to devalue them. Besides, there aren't many options available.   The answer also was vague when Bush was asked what theadministration is going to do about the planned Sept. 1 inaugurationof a new president of Panama, the chosen candidate of military bossManuel Noriega in an aborted election that U.S. observers said wasstolen. The United States wants Noriega out, but Bush said he isn'tholding his breath waiting for the Panamanian strongman to govoluntarily.   ``I don't know for sure what we're going to do,'' he said.   Not many options there, either, after more than two years of U.S.efforts to get rid of Noriega, who is under U.S. indictment on drugtrafficking charges.   Bush has proven far more willing than his predecessors to say inplain language that he doesn't know something. At his rare newsconferences, Ronald Reagan sometimes misspoke because he tried totalk his way around questions rather than acknowledging that hedidn't have any answer. At his frequent ones, Bush shows no qualmsabout saying ``I just don't know,'' as he did Tuesday when askedabout prospects for the release of the hostages.   Ambiguity can serve domestic purposes, too. With a multibilliondrug fighting program to be announced on Sept. 5, Bush said somefederal money is going to have to be reallocated in order to financethe new program without raising taxes. He would not say whichprograms will take the budget hits. ``... The final decisionshaven't been made,'' Bush said.   For the president to telegraph those spending shifts and thenleave town for his three-week vacation in Kennebunkport, Maine,would have been to invite warfare in the bureaucracy as the managersof threatened programs lobbied to keep their budgets intact. Betterto leave everyone guessing.   ``Stay tuned, and we will show you in September how we're goingto allocate the resources for this,'' Bush said.   There also are variations. After agreeing with budget directorRichard G. Darman that he'd like to see the Federal Reserve Boardease interest rates, Bush was asked whether he also agreed that theFed would be to blame if rates don't come down and there is arecession.   ``Well,'' said Bush, ``I'd like to go back, because i don'trecall that part of it, and take that under advisement and let youknow at a later date.''   What did he say?   He didn't say.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Walter R.
