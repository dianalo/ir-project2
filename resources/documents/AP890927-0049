(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A band of Chippewa Indians has agreedto curtail its spearfishing and other treaty rights in exchange foran expected multimillion-dollar aid package.   The tentative accord Tuesday came after months of negotiationsby the state with leaders of the Lac du Flambeau Chippewa band,whose spring spearfishing has sparked widespread and sometimesviolent protests by treaty rights opponents.   If approved by tribal members and the Legislature, the agreementwould be the first reached between the state and its six Chippewabands. The Mole Lake band reached a tentative agreement with thestate, but that $10 million, 10-year deal was voted down by tribalmembers in January.   Treaty rights of the Chippewa to hunt and fish onnon-reservation lands across much of northern Wisconsin have beenupheld in a series of federal court rulings since 1983.   State Attorney General Donald Hanaway said the tentativeagreement with the Lac du Flambeau would span 10 years and includea trust fund for the band.   The Lac du Flambeau, the most active Chippewa band inspearfishing, would continue ceremonial spearfishing but ``agreedto forebear and forego the exercise of their treaty rights,''Hanaway said.   Both sides declined to disclose details.   Lac du Flambeau leaders had been seeking a 10-year deal worth$42 million, including payments of about $1,400 per individualmember. The state recently added other provisions, reportedly worthup to $10 million.   Hanaway said he hoped to have the tentative agreement in writingwithin a week, and have a final document ready for the Legislatureby mid-October.   Gov. Tommy G. Thompson said he supported the tentative accord,but some legislators expressed caution.   Assembly Minority Leader David Prosser called the agreement ``anencouraging sign,'' but Sen. Joseph Leean said it probably wouldtake ``one heck of a sell job'' for him to support it.   He said voters did not believe ``we ought to have to ante upmillions of dollars when the problem was created by federaltreaties.''   Michael Allen, tribal chairman, said the tribal council approvedof the package, and he planned to take it to members for a vote.   James Klauser, state administration secretary and Thompson'schief adviser, said the fund would be administered by trustees, andthe money would be used for education, law enforcement, health andeconomic development programs.   The accord could serve as a model for the state's other fiveChippewa bands, said James Jannetta, Lac du Flambeau tribalattorney.   ``Hopefully, other bands will look at this as a historic step,''he said.   Spearfishing by the Chippewas prompted demonstrations at somenorthern boat landings by hundreds of people in recent years.   Opposition to spearfishing grew even more heated this year afterthe state announced it would reduce walleye pike catch limits forsport anglers. The announcement followed a federal court rulingthat allowed the Chippewa to spear as many of the fish thatbiologists determined could be taken from the lakes without hurtingthe fish population.   Last spring's spearfishing season was marked by incidents ofname-calling and rock-throwing at some lakes and resulted in about200 arrests.   Federal court rulings since 1983 upheld provisions of 19thcentury treaties that allow the Chippewa to fish, hunt, trap andharvest wild grain on non-reservation lands across most of northernWisconsin.</TEXT></DOC>
