TheTask Force, staffed by the Nebraska Energy Office and a group of consultantsled by Technical Development Corporation, developed technical assistanceand financing options to facilitate the implementation of major energyimprovement projects. The program design process took into account thetechnical potential for energy efficiency in various kinds of facilities,capital budgeting and financing practices in the different jurisdictions,and the policy goals of the Nebraska Energy Office. As a result of theseconsiderations, the Task Force designed different programs for two groups:State government facilities, and the facilities of local jurisdictionsincluding municipal and county government, school districts, health careinstitutions and private colleges. The Nebraska Energy Office then retainedTechnical Development Corporation to conduct research on the market forthese programs among local jurisdictions, and to prepare recommendationsconcerning program implementation and marketing.</TEXT></DOC>
