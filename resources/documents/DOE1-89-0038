If the estimatesare accurate (it is unknown if the figure refers to total or recoverablereserves), this makes Tengiz not only one of the largest petroleum depositsin the USSR, but in the world. Whether this potential can be developedis still unclear. The Tengiz field was discovered in late 1979 and hasbeen characterized by Soviet experts as one of the most complex and difficultto produce in the entire USSR. The reservoir rocks are of relativelypoor quality, and being fissured limestones pose unusual drilling problems.The oil is also quite deep, at 4500-5500 meters. Other development problemsarise in the anomalously great reservoir pressure and the high hydrogensulfide and gas condensate content of the associated gas, which requiresthe construction of a gas processing facility, to be built nearby atKaraton. The harsh physical environment and the lack of infrastructure(the field is located in salt flats on the edge of the Caspian Sea) alsohinder development. The Tengizneftegaz production association was officiallyestablished in 1985, but has yet to process any gas or produce any oil.</TEXT></DOC>
