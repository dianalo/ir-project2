Experimental results are compared to the exciton modeland excitation energies in the fissioning nuclei are deduced. By comparingthe present data with the results on other systems, the influences ofentrance channel conditions and composite-like nuclei temperatures arediscussed to explain the evolution of the high linear momentum transferregion. The coexistence of both massive transfer mechanism and head-oncollisions followed by preequilibrium is suggested.</TEXT></DOC>
