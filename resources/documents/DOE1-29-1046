<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-29-1046 </DOCNO><TEXT>Two solar collectors were exposed for five years in a weathering experiment,keeping the maximum temperature under solar irradiation limited by simplethermoregulated heat exchange circuits in order to simulate real userconditions. The installation used was a prototype for operational tests,and preceeded another experiment of the same type, which is still runningin two zones of different environment regarding corrosivity of the atmosphere,for the study of atmospheric corrosion and degradation. Observationsmade during operation and the results are given of the examinations ofthe collectors after five year's exposure. 4 refs., 9 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
