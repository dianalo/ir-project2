SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   It isn't just the Western industrial nationsthat face the problems of coping with an aging population, theCensus Bureau reported Tuesday. Four-fifths of the increase in olderpeople is occurring in the Third World.   Developing countries currently include 58 percent of all peopleaged 55 and over. And those nations account for some 80 percent ofthe 1.2 million people who pass that birthday every month, accordingto the new Census study ``Aging in the Third World.''   Even so, it's the richer, developed nations where aging hasattracted the most attention, as longer-lived populations stress themedical and social welfare systems and generate political interestand debate.   Perhaps, the study indicates, the developing nations can learnfrom the experience of the countries that faced the problem ahead ofthem.   ``Aging in most developing countries has not yet emerged as adominant social phenomenon,'' the by population researcher KevinKinsella observes.   But over the next 30 years, he points out, the balance isexpected to shift markedly, with some 72 percent of older peopleexpected to be living in developing nations in the year 2020,compared to 58 percent today.   Those countries have the opportunity to learn from the effortsand mistakes made by the industrialized nations of Europe and NorthAmerica, Kinsella reports.   ``These nations have time to assess demographic projections,consider structural changes in social institutions such as marriageand the family, compare and evaluate programmatic responses alreadyattempted and, in short, debate issues before they are branded ascrises,'' Kinsella concluded.   With improved medical care extending lifespans, the industrialnations of Europe and North America have already experienced a sharpgrowth in the proportion of elderly in their populations, and theneeds of these groups for medical and social services.   ``In many cases, however, countries have not aged gracefully,''Kinsella reports, commenting that belated recognition of the problemhas led to inappropriate and insufficient response on the part ofgovernments.   Kinsella's study defines ``older'' people as those 55 and above,terming those 65 and over as ``elderly'' and referring to the group75 and over as the ``oldest old.'' He notes, however, that those arearbitrary labels and that biological, physical and psychologicalaging differ from person to person.   Here are some highlights of the study:   _The Caribbean is the ``oldest`` developing area with 11.7percent of its population aged 55 and over. Asia is next at 10.4percent followed by Latin America at 9.4 percent and Africa, 7.0percent.   _In most developing areas the oldest old, those 75 and over, areincreasing faster than the older population in general.   _Rural areas tend to have higher proportions of older people thanurban areas.   _Women outlive men in virtually all areas of the world,regardless the overall life expectancy. Thus, older women outnumberolder men and widowhood is a fact of life for most women.   _The nature of disease in developing countries is shifting fromcommunicable to chronic as populations age. The number of disabledpersons in the Third World is likely to grow rapidly, and changingdisease patterns may require a reevaluation of health services.   _The relative balance between society's two dependent groups, theold and young, is shifting as declines in fertility reduce thenumber of children while longer lives increase the older segment.</TEXT></DOC>
