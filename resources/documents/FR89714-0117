The purpose of the demonstration is to determine the feasibilityof using public housing projects, and facilities near such projects, toprovide child care services for lower income families that reside in publichousing. On February 5, 1988, President Reagan signed the Housing and CommunityDevelopment Act of 1987 (``the 1987 Act'') (Pub. L. 100-242). Section 117of the 1987 Act amended the HURRA to provide that grants could be awardedto nonprofit organizations for the purpose of operating child care programsthat enable the parents or guardians of young children to be employed orto receive employment training. The primary objective of the demonstrationis to determine whether the availability of accessible child care willenable public housing residents to obtain or retain jobs, or to enrollin training that might lead to employment.The Department published a notice of fund availability (NOFA) on August17, 1988 (53 FR 31256) to implement the 1987 legislative amendments, andto announce the availability of $5 million for the PHCC demonstration programin fiscal year 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">1988 McKinney Amendment</ITAG>``In or near a lower income housing project''Under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987, one of the statutoryrequirements for receiving PHCC assistance was that the proposed childcare facility had to be located in a lower income housing project. Theterm ``lower income housing project'' was defined in the August 10, 1987NOFA to mean housing developed, acquired, or assisted by a public housingagency (PHA) under the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (other than Section 8 housing).The Department construed this definition to include housing developed,acquired or assisted by an Indian housing authority (IHA).On November 7, 1988 Congress amended the requirement that the child carefacility had to be located in a lower income housing project. Section 1002of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Amendments Act of 1988 (Pub.L. 100-628) (1988 McKinney Act) provides that the child care facility maybe located ``in or near'' a public housing project. As a result, nonprofitorganizations may now apply to receive grant funds to opeate a child carefacility under this demonstration either on the premises of a public housingproject, or near such a project.HUD is construing ``near'' to mean that the proposed child care facilitymust be within a reasonable walking distance to the project, based uponits distance from the project and the types of thoroughfares that mustbe crossed. As part of its submission to HUD, applicants are required tocertify that the proposed facility is within a reasonable walking distanceto the project.If a nonprofit organization seeks to establish an offsite child care center,it will need to located a PHA that is willing to provide the facility.Section 11.2(c)(3)(i) of this NOFA requires the nonprofit entity to includein its grant application evidence that the PHA has, or will be able to,assume control of the proposed offsite premises. This evidence can includecopies of the negotiated lease, an option to lease, or a resolution fromthe lessor's board of directors indicating that the facility will be availableto the PHA for use as a child care facility.While PHAs may use their operating subsidies to provide the offsite childcare facilities under this demonstration, a number of PHAs may find thatthey are financially constrained from exploring this option. Therefore,PHAs with limited operating budgets may choose to enter into lease-backarrangements with nonprofit applicants that already own a facility, orenter into a lease with a third party at nominal or no cost.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>Applicants that intend to use grant funds to renovate abuilding owned by a primarily religious organization are advised that certainFirst Amendment requirements not contained in this NOFA may be incorporatedinto the grant agreement executed with HUD.</ITAG>Resident Management Corporations and Resident Councils; Grant SelectionProceduresThe development and operation of child care facilities in or near publichousing projects requires the active involvement and commitment of publichousing residents and their organizations. The Department encourages PHAsto make Resident Management Corporations (RMCs) and Resident Councils (RCs)full partners in this effort. An RMC or RC under this NOFA must complywith the requirements of 24 CFR Part 964 (as amended on September 7, 1988,see 53 FR 34676). However, to facilitate the development and operationof child care facilities in public housing projects, RCs may manage suchfacilities notwithstanding the otherwise applicable requirements of 24CFR Part 964. To emphasize the importance that the Department attachesto full RMC/RC participation in the development and operation of childcare facilities, HUD is awarding points in the selection process (underSection 10 of this NOFA) to applicants that are RMCs or RCs.This rating criteria will not, however, be applied to applicants that seekto establish child care facilities to serve Indian housing projects. IHAsare not covered by the Department's existing tenant participation and managementregulations (24 CFR Part 964) and, hence, would be competitively disadvantagedby this rating criterion. Until HUD promulgates final regulations on Indiantenant participation, either through an amendment to Part 964 or as partof the Indian Consolidated Rule under Part 905, the selection process underthis demonstration program will be as follows:All grant applicants will be reviewed to determine threshold eligibilityunder Section 9.1. HUD will then evaluate each application on the basisof the selective rating factors at Section 10 and assign the appropriatescores. Applicants that want to establish a child care facility to servea public housing project will be evaluated on all seven elements listedat Section 10 (including the RMC/RC participation rating element), andwill be ranked based upon their total selective rating score. Applicantsthat will serve an Indian housing project will be rated on six elements,but <T3>not</T3> on the RMC/RC participation element, and will be separatelyranked based upon their total selective rating score.HUD may then use its discretion under Section 9.4 of this NOFA to ensurean equitable distribution of grant funds among both pools of top-ratedapplicants_those that will serve public housing and Indian housing projects.In exercising its discretion under this section, HUD shall take into accountthe overall ratio of PHAs to IHAs; the ratio of fundable applications submittedby nonprofit organizations serving public and Indian housing projects;and the extent of available grant funds under this demonstration.The Department may also exercise its discretion under andSection; 9.5 tosubstitute one or more highly rated applications if the top-rated applicationsunder the selection criteria do not ensure equitable geographical distributionamong urban and rural areas, and among nonprofit organizations providingchild care services to lower income housing projects of varying sizes.Lead Based Paint GuidelinesThe requirements of the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act, as amended,(42 U.S.C. 4821-4846) and implementing regulations at 24 CFR Part 35 shallapply to this demonstration program as follows:<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Post-1978 Buildings</ITAG>A child care facility that is to be located in a building that was constructedor substantially rehabilitated after January 1, 1978 does not trigger leadbased paint requirements. Either the PHA (for onsite facilities) or thenonprofit (for offsite child care facilities) must certify that the buildingin which the child care facility is to be located was constructed or substantiallyrehabilitated after January 1, 1978.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Pre-1978 Buildings</ITAG>A child care facility that is to be located in a building that was constructedor substantially rehabilitated prior to 1978 must have all applicable surfacestested for the presence of lead-based paint (lead content of greater thanor equal to 1 mg/cm\2\). Testing is to be performed in accordance withthe requirements of 24 CFR Part 965 (this would not include the periodicinspection requirement under andSection; 965.704). If lead-based paint isdetected, abatement procedures under 24 CFR 35.24 (as revised on June 6,1988; 53 FR 20790) must be undertaken. A certification must be providedby the PHA (for onsite child care facilities) or the nonprofit (for offsitefacilities) that the building in which the child care facility is to belocated will be tested for lead-based paint and, if found, abatement procedureswill be undertaken as required by 24 CFR 35.24 before the facilities areused for child care.Grant funds under this demonstration may be used for lead-based paint testingthat is undertaken after the execution of the grant agreement with HUD.Grant funds may <T3>not</T3> be used for lead-based paint abatement. Should lead-basedpaint abatement be required, grantees that intend to operate off-site childcare facilities are advised to seek State, local and private funding forthis purpose. Grantees that intend to operate a child care facility withina lower income housing project may request funding from the PHA (ComprehensiveImprovement Assistance Program). Each such request will be evaluated bythe PHA and HUD on a case-by-case basis.Because of the prohibitive costs associated with lead based paint abatement,and the fact that abatement activities are not eligible program costs,PHAs are advised to locate child care facilities in newer buildings thathave less likelihood of containing lead based paint.Program GuidelinesThis NOFA provides nonprofit organizations with guidelines for the preparationof a grant application under the PHCC demonstration.

The requirements of the Lead-Based Paint PoisoningPrevention Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4821-4846) and implementing regulationsat 24 CFR Part 35 shall apply as follow:1. Post-1978 BuildingsA child care facility that is to be located in a building that was constructedor substantially rehabilitated after January 1, 1978 does not trigger leadbased paint requirements. Either the PHA (for onsite facilities) or thenonprofit (for offsite child care facilities) must certify that the buildingin which the child care facility is to be located was constructed or substantiallyrehabilitated after January 1, 1978.2. Pre-1978 BuildingsA child care facility that is to be located in a building that was constructedor substantially rehabilitated <T3>prior to </T3>1978 must have all applicable surfaces tested for thepresence of lead-based paint (lead content of greater than or equal to1 mg/cm\2\). Testing is to be performed in accordance with the requirementsof 24 CFR Part 965 (this would not include the periodic inspection requirementunder andSection; 965.704). If lead-based paint is detected, abatement proceduresunder 24 CFR 35.24 (as revised on June 6, 1988; 53 FR 20790) must be undertaken.A certification must be provided by the PHA (for onsite child care facilities)or the nonprofit (for offset facilities) that the building in which thechild care facility is to be located will be tested for lead-based paintand, if found, abatement procedures will be undertaken as required by 24CFR 35.24 before the facilities are used for child care.Grant funds under this demonstration may be used for lead-based paint testingthat is undertaken after the execution of the grant agreement with HUD.Grant funds may <T3>not </T3>be used for lead-based paint abatement. Should lead-basedpaint abatement be required, grantees that intend to operate offsite childcare facilities are advised to seek State, local and private funding forthis purpose. Grantees that intend to operate a child care facility withina lower income housing project may request funding from the PHA (ComprehensiveImprovement Assistance Program_comprehensive or lead-based paint modernization(for FY 90)). Each such request will be evaluated by the PHA and HUD ona case-by-case basis.Because of the prohibitive costs associated with lead based paint abatement,and the fact that abatement activities are not eligible program costs,PHAs are advised to locate their child care facilities in newer buildingsthat have less likelihood of containing lead based paint.14.3 <T3>OMB Circulars</T3>.
