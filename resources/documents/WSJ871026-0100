The annual growth rate of the real gross national product, the inflation-adjusted value of the nation's output of goods and services, increased to 3.8% in the third quarter from 2.5% in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said. The improvement reflected strong growth in business investment on equipment and a gain in consumer spending as people took advantage of auto makers' discount financing programs.    In addition, the Labor Department's consumer price index last month edged up 0.2% as higher prices for food and apparel offset a sharp drop in energy prices. The department said the rise translates to a 2.1% compound annual rate. A GNP-based price measure known as the deflator rose at a 2.4% annual rate in the third quarter, after increasing at a 3.5% pace in the second.    The reports reflect economic conditions before the plunge in the stock market, which has created uncertainty about the future course of the economy. Most economists expect consumer and capital spending to weaken in coming quarters as a result of the market crash.    Lyle Gramley, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association, said &quot;some fallout&quot; is likely after the stock plunge. But he said the GNP report &quot;confirms the view that the economy was growing quite strongly in third quarter. The economy had a lot of steam heading into this turmoil. Unless the negative effects of the stock market are overwhelming, we're likely to avoid a recession.&quot;    &quot;The figures are all pretty good,&quot; said Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers. &quot;The GNP number shows a pretty solid and balanced economic picture, and inflation is decelerating rather than increasing.&quot;    The GNP figures, the government's initial estimate of third-quarter growth, are preliminary and may be subject to significant revision.    The most negative aspect of the reports was the first deterioration in the nation's trade balance since the third quarter of 1986. During the third quarter, imports increased to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $568.5 billion from a $547.2 billion pace the previous quarter. By comparison, exports rose less, reaching only a $430.6 billion clip from a $414.5 billion rate in the second quarter.    For weeks, the Reagan administration has insisted that the trade figures would bolster its claim that the gap was narrowing after adjustment for inflation and seasonal variation. The monthly merchandise trade figures -- which aren't adjusted and have shown little improvement -- have contributed to the stock market slide.    At a news conference, Commerce Undersecretary Robert Ortner said he &quot;was disappointed to see the setback&quot; in the trade numbers, which reflected big increases in imports and exports and left the gap wider than in the first quarter. But the department said the import rise resulted almost totally from higher oil shipments, which Mr. Ortner and several private economists attributed partly to stockpile-building in anticipation of possible trouble in the Persian Gulf.    Moreover, private and government economists generally agree that robust growth in exports, which helped fuel the strong capital spending in the third quarter, is buoying the nation's industrial sector. The manufacturers association's Mr. Jasinowski said that manufacturing trade numbers were better in the third quarter than in the second.    The 3.8% growth figure keeps the Reagan administration on track for its 3.2% growth target for 1987, Mr. Ortner, the Commerce official, said. He played down the possible effect of the market crash. The economy has to grow at a 2.1% rate in the fourth quarter to reach 3.2% growth.    In the third quarter, the strength in business investment reflected large increases in outlays for office and computing equipment and in oil and gas drilling. Residential investment weakened, in response to higher mortgage rates, and inventory investment slowed.    The 0.2% September rise in the consumer price index followed an increase in August of 0.5%, or a 5.8% annual rate. &quot;The inflationary expectations were not justified,&quot; said Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting project at Georgia State University. Investor worries about an acceleration in inflation had contributed to the market's slide.    Energy prices fell 0.5% last month after increasing 1.7% in August. Gasoline prices fell 0.2% after rising in each of the previous eight months. Food prices rose 0.5% after a 0.1% increase in August. Excluding food and energy prices, which tend to bounce around, the index rose 0.2% after a 0.4% increase.    The biggest jump last month came in apparel prices, which rose 1.1% after being unchanged in August.    Like the GNP report, the consumer price figures are adjusted for seasonal variation. Before adjustment, the consumer price index in September rose 0.5% to 344.4% of its 1967 average and stood 4.3% above a year earlier.    The index for urban wage earners and clerical workers, a measure that includes half the number of people covered by the broader index and is used in adjusting Social Security and retirement benefits, rose an adjusted 0.2% in September after a 0.5% rise in August. Before seasonal adjustment, this index was up 0.5% to 339.1% of its 1967 average and was 4.4% above a year earlier.    The Labor Department also said the average weekly earnings of U.S. workers fell 1.1% in September after adjustment for inflation and seasonal factors. These earnings increased a revised 0.5% in August. Previously, the department said earnings in August rose 0.9%.    Average hourly earnings were unchanged last month, while hours worked fell 0.9%.    Weekly earnings of U.S. workers averaged 312.09 after adjustment for seasonal factors but not for inflation, down from $314.80 the month before. Before seasonal adjustment, average weekly earnings fell to $314.38 from $315.58.
