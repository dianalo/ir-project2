CITY LIABILITY      Local governments may be forced to pay monetary damages to peoplewhose rights are violated by inadequately trained public employees,the Supreme Court ruled unanimously today.   Ruling in a case from Canton, Ohio, the justices said cities andtowns may be held legally accountable if the inadequate trainingstemmed from governmental ``deliberate indifference.''   In an opinion by Justice Byron R. White, the court said theinadequate training also must be closely related to the ultimateinjury suffered before local governments can be forced to paydamages.   White said the court was imposing a stringent standard for thosefiling such suits because any lesser standard would open localgovernments to ``unprecedented liability'' and saddle federal courtswith ``an endless exercise of second-guessing municipalemployee-training programs.''   The case is Canton vs. Harris, 86-1088.      STRIKERS      The court said railroads and airlines may penalize strikers bygiving their jobs to employees with less seniority who stay on thejob or return to work before the strike ends.   In a 6-3 ruling which was a victory for Trans World Airlines,Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said that such a policy ``of encouragingpre-strike workers to remain on the job during the strike or toabandon the strike and return to work before all vacancies werefilled'' is a legitimate ``exercise of TWA's peaceful economicpower.''   The case is TWA vs. Flight Attendants, 87-548.      TAX INFORMATION      The court made it easier for the U.S. government to turn over taxinformation to a foreign government.   The 9-0 ruling allows Canadian officials to see financial recordsof two Canadian citizens with bank accounts in Washington state.   The case is U.S. vs. Stuart, 87-1064.      DEATH SENTENCE      The court reinstated a convicted Florida murderer's deathsentence, saying he should have been barred from mounting asuccessful constitutional attack in federal courts.   By a 5-4 vote, the court ruled that Aubrey Adams Jr., forfeitedhis right to challenge his sentence in federal court on grounds hefailed to raise in state court.   Adams was convicted of strangling an 8-year-old girl in Ocala 11years ago.   The case is Dugger vs. Adams, 87-121.</TEXT></DOC>
