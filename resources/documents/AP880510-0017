Dukakis has the likes ofDorothea Thomas-Vitrac to contend with too.   Thomas-Vitrac's dispute with the Massachusetts governor isstrictly a local affair. But she _ like other political enemies ofDukakis _ intends to do what she can to disrupt the governor'spresidential bid in order to make her point. As Dukakis comes underincreasing scrutiny, that task becomes easier and easier.   Thomas-Vitrac is a member of the board of selectmen in the tinywestern Massachusetts town of New Braintree, where Dukakis hasproposed building a 500-bed prison. She has led the fight againstit.   When Dukakis went to Iowa late last year to tell strugglingfarmers he was concerned about their plight, Thomas-Vitrac went too.   ``He wouldn't acknowledge me, but I was blocking the onlyentrance to the pigpen,'' Thomas-Vitrac said. ``I think I made mypoint.''   Former Massachusetts Gov. Edward King, a former Democraticgovernor who has switched parties, is making his point too. TheBush campaign is bankrolling King's travel around the countrycriticizing Dukakis.   King turned Dukakis out of office in 1978; Dukakis defeated Kingin 1982.   King made a speech Monday, attacking Dukakis' image as acompetent manager.   ``I don't think it's based on facts,'' he said. ``I think itsharply contrasts what he has done.''   A Dukakis presidency, King said, would bring ``an everexpanding, more costly government, more regulation, more taxes.''   Another vocal Dukakis opponent is Barbara Anderson, the directorof the anti-tax group Citizens for Limited Taxation. The group hassuccessfully battled Dukakis' efforts in the last five years tocreate additional exemptions to a voter-passed property tax cap.   When Dukakis takes credit on the presidential campaign trail forcutting taxes back home in Massachusetts, Anderson fumes.   ``He was dragged kicking and screaming into those tax cuts,''said Anderson. ``The reputation is a fabricated myth.''   When Dukakis heads to California later this week to campaign, helikely will be reminded of a policy in Massachusetts thateffectively bans homosexuals from becoming foster parents byencouraging placements of foster children in ``traditional''families.   The Washington-based National Gay and Lesbian Task Force sincelast year has organized protests of Dukakis events, and activistsand newspapers in California's gay community have criticized thepolicy.   Dukakis is a supporter of a gay rights bill languishing beforethe state legislature, but the foster parent policy has tended toovershadow that.   ``He's responsible for a very discriminatory social policy,''said task force spokeswoman Sue Hyde.   Massachusetts politics are dominated by Democrats, but not allof them shower praise on Dukakis.   ``I've always felt that he's spent too much,'' said Rep. JohnFlood of Canton, chairman of the House Taxation Committee. ``We'vespent all this money and we haven't addressed our major problems,overcrowded prisons, unfunded pension liability and the need formore money to clean up hazardous waste.''   Flood was quick to add: ``Of course George Bush has a lot ofbaggage of his own.''   Charlie Manning, meanwhile, is relishing his job these days.   As the top spokesman for the Massachusetts Republican Party,Manning gets a lot of attention when he talks about Dukakis.Manning said he has been fielding an ``incredible'' number oftelephone calls from out-of-state reporters in recent weeks.   Not only does Manning take every opportunity to rap the governor_ he calls the thought of a Dukakis presidency ``scary'' _ he'salways willing to steer journalists toward other critics of Dukakis.   In fact, he has a new card in his desktop Rolodex _ just fornumbers of Dukakis enemies.   ``I made it just for moments like these,'' he said with obviousglee.</TEXT></DOC>
