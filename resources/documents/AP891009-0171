That practice, calledclear-cutting, has persisted to this day, even in publicly ownednational forests. There is one notable exception, the ShawneeNational Forest in Illinois.</TEXT><BYLINE>By PAUL DE LA GARZA</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CARBONDALE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   New restrictions on the way loggersharvest timber in the vast Shawnee National Forest in southernIllinois has given environmentalists hope that others will followsuit.   A Shawnee management plan that went into effect last year bansalmost all clear-cutting, the chopping down of all trees regardlessof their age in tracts of 20 to 40 acres, instead of selectivecutting of individual trees.   ``What happened in the Shawnee is nationally significant becauseit's never happened before,'' says Jim Bensman of the Sierra Club.``Now you can say: `Look at the Shawnee. If they can do it, whycan't we?'''   But the U.S. Forest Service, which manages 156 national forests,is not rushing into a nationwide ban on clear-cutting.   ``Our management philosophy,'' explains F. Dale Robertson,Forest Service chief, ``is to let these things be worked outlocally as it has been done in the Shawnee. We want to be at peacewith the local people.''   Some heated words were exchanged in the battle of the Shawnee, a262,000-acre forest of oak and hickory bounded on the east by theOhio River and on the west by the Mississippi River.   Joe Glisson of the grassroots organization Regional Associationof Concerned Environmentalists called his opposition ``bumblingidiots.'' Charles Daugherty, president of the Illinois WoodProducts Association, called Glisson's group ``meddlesome folks''and troublemakers.   Somewhere in the middle was the U.S. Forest Service.   Environmentalists say clear-cutting causes erosion, degradeswater quality, reduces the wildlife habitat and leaves an uglylandscape of stumps and ruffled underbrush.   But the Forest Service, while conceding clear-cutting adverselyaffects some wildlife, maintains it's the best method of caring forand cultivating forests.   Clearcuts, the agency argues, emulate natural disasters such asfires, which rejuvenate timber stands. The large cuts allowsunshine to saturate the forest, enhancing growth.   The practice also benefits some game animals such as deer andwild turkey, the Forest Service says.   The agency reminds critics that federal law requires it tomaintain timber for America's use and that without logging roadsthe public would have no access to the forest.   Len Carey, an agency spokesman in Washington, likensclear-cutting to harvesting corn.   ``What about clear-cutting in the cornfields? Isn't that what wedo? Grow the corn and cut it down?''   The National Forest Products Association points out that thetimber industry nationally employs 1.3 million people with anannual payroll of $29.6 billion.   ``We're not the bad guys,'' Daugherty says. ``We're who make thejobs.''   Chopping individual trees was the predominant method of loggingbefore World War II. After the war, the Forest Service approvedstepped-up clear-cutting to satisfy the growing demand for lumber.   The goal of clear-cutting is twofold: the immediate sale of alarge quantity of timber and the replacement of the natural forestwith even-aged stands of trees of the commercially preferredspecies.   Of the 11 billion to 12 billion board feet cut annually from the191 million acres of federal forest land, about half is harvestedby clear-cutting, says the Forest Service's Dick Fitzgerald inWashington.   But the Wilderness Society puts the figure closer to 75 percent.   The Shawnee dispute is rooted in the National Forest ManagementAct of 1976, which required national forests to devise 50-yearmanagement plans.   The act also required that clear-cutting only be used when foundto be the ``optimum method'' of tree harvesting.   In November 1986, the Shawnee approved its forest plan.   Four appeals were filed by environmental groups.   The original draft of the plan emphasized clear-cutting as thepreferred method of harvest and placed annual hardwood harvestlevels at 12.6 million board feet. A typical 30-foot tree yieldsabout 1,000 board feet.   On Aug. 15, 1988, after mediated talks, the agency agreed toalter its forest plan, eliminating clear-cutting almost entirely.   All but one appellant, the Association of ConcernedEnvironmentalists, agreed to drop their appeals.   Forest Service officials and environmentalists say that whilemanagement plans in other national forests limit clear-cutting,none comes close to the Shawnee.   According to environmentalists, many of the ecological problemslinked to clear-cutting are reduced by using individual treeselection or group selection _ smaller cuts in the forest.   Leon Minckler, a consultant on environmental forestry inVirginia and a 33-year veteran of the Forest Service, conducted a20-year experiment in group selection on the Kaskaskia ExperimentalForest in southern Illinois.   He believes it works.   ``The Forest Service has in almost no cases shown thatclear-cutting is the optimum method,'' Minckler says. ``It might bethe optimum method for the logger. It's not optimum for theforest.''   Minckler says the Forest Service balks at group selectionbecause it's time-consuming and costs more money. Foresters mustexamine each tree to determine if it's ready for the mill.   The agency contends alternatives are unproven, albeit Minckler'sresearch found that under group selection the forest remains highlydiversified, providing a wide range of habitat for wildlife.   But the Forest Service said more acreage is affected by groupselection and its smaller cuts in order to get the same harvestvolume as clear-cutting.   The Regional Association of Concerned Environmentalists, unlikethe Sierra Club, opposes all clear-cutting, except for theelimination of diseased timber stands _ a position that riles thetimber industry.   Rich Hoppie of the Wilderness Society called the Shawneeclear-cutting ban ``a small step.''   ``We want to see it done more,'' he said, ``but we have noexpectations that the Forest Service will do so willingly.''</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV</NOTE></DOC>
