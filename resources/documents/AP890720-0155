MILLER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   African foreign ministers agreed inprinciple Thursday to form a pan-African military force to helpblack states resist incursions by South Africa.   The Organization of African Unity's council of ministers adopteda recommendation calling for a joint defense force but put off itscreation pending a study on how it would be funded.   The 50-member OAU has been plagued by financial problemsthroughout its 26-year history. Many members are badly behind ontheir annual dues.   The organization has considered assembling a similar force inthe past, but the idea has never passed the conceptual stage.   Sylvestre Nganzimana, an OAU assistant secretary, said theproposed force would be made up of military units from membersnations which could be called up as a unified force.   ``What is envisioned is a force that would assist the frontlinestates, which have suffered incursions and destabilization by SouthAfrica,'' he said. ``It would also work closely with nationalliberation organizations and act as a peacekeeping and observerforce.''   The financial study was not due to be completed until next year.   The OAU's defense commission, which brought the recommendationto the council, noted in its report that the United Nationsestimates the cost of keeping one of its typical peacekeepingforces in the field for six months at about $150 million.   The frontline states comprise Angola, Botswana, Mozambique,Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.   The foreign ministers were meeting in Ethiopia's capital citythis week to draw up an agenda for a conference of OAU heads ofstate. The meeting opens Monday.</TEXT></DOC>
