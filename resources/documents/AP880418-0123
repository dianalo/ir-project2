The 24-year-old student gained access to the computers foralmost two years through his own computer and telephone links,according to the West German newsmagazine Quick.   Some of the raided computers are at the Air Force SystemsCommand in El Segundo, Calif., and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratoryin Pasedena, Calif., said Hans-Georg von Bock, prosecuting attorneyin Bremen.   FBI spokesmen said their agency was investigating. They declinedto say whether charges would be filed.   Bock refused to say what the student, who is from Hanover,discovered in his computer break-ins. Quick said the student wasable to find out the names of U.S. Army officers in Japan anddetails about U.S. coastal security systems.   However, no one said whether the man uncovered any importantsecrets.   Bock said Bremen authorities had abandoned their inquiry forlack of evidence. Bock refused to provide any details about thesuspect _ including his name _ because the investigation had beendropped.   ``We wanted to catch the suspect committing the acts, butunfortunately that did not happen,'' Bock said.   He said the electronic links were made by telephone via acomputer at Bremen University.   ``The (Bremen) court decided it could not be proven whooriginated these calls,'' Bock said.   Hackers are computer enthusiasts who try to gain unauthorizedaccess to other computers through telephone lines. Some hackers saythey commit their electronic break-ins just for fun.   Quick said the electronic break-ins were detected in August 1986by the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif., which doesunclassified research. The laboratory and its sister institution,the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, which is involved in nuclearweapons research and the Strategic Defense Initiative known as``Star Wars,'' are operated by the University of California for theU.S. government.   Quick said authorities questioned the student in June and thebreak-ins stopped at about that time.   Bock said West German investigators had been handicapped becauseGerman law prevents them from tapping telephones unless theysuspect a more serious crime, such as murder.</TEXT></DOC>
