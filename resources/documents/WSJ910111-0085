One official said the proposal would save hundreds ofthousands of barrels of oil daily by the year 2000.</LP><TEXT>   After weeks of interagency contention over alternativefuels, officials said a cabinet-level policy group hasadvised Mr. Bush to include the nationwide fleet proposal asa key feature of his energy policy.   The proposal will help address concerns byenvironmentalists and others that the administration isn'tpaying enough attention to conservation and renewable energyin drawing up its energy policy. However, otherrecommendations are likely to inflame opposition, includingthe policy group's decision not to recommend tougher fueleconomy standards for cars. Instead, advisers favor a study-- like that already announced by the TransportationDepartment -- of how much fuel mileage can be increased.   There's no estimate yet of how much the administration'sentire package of proposals would reduce U.S. oil dependence.Mr. Bush, who now has received all but a few final optionsfrom the White House's Economic Policy Council, still mustchoose which recommendations go into his final package. TheWhite House is undecided on when to release the package. Someadvisers want it unveiled in February with the fiscal 1992budget, while others argue to wait for further developmentsin the Mideast crisis.   Officials said there is consensus among the policy groupon &quot;about 95%&quot; of the proposals going to Mr. Bush. Still incontention, and left for Mr. Bush to decide, are proposals toseek energy-efficiency standards for light bulbs, to reversethe Internal Revenue Service and make energy-conservationutility rebates non-taxable, and to revamp tax credits forrenewable-energy projects. All would require legislation.   The fleet proposal, which also requires legislation, wouldexpand a mandate under the new Clean Air Act that fleetsfilling up at central pumps switch to cleaner-burning fuels,such as natural gas or methanol, that aren't derived fromoil. The new proposal would step up the timetable and expandthe requirement from 24 cities to nationwide, althoughexceptions would be made for rural and certain other areas,according to officials.   A companion proposal, also requiring congressionalapproval, is meant to give car makers greater incentive tobuild vehicles that can run on alternative fuels. It wouldlift the cap on credits auto makers already can earn if theybuild alternative-fueled cars; the credits can be applied tomeeting the average 27.5 mile-per-gallon fuel economystandard for new models. Environmentalists fear that grantingsuch credits may encourage the use of alternative fuels atthe expense of overall fuel economy.   Environmentalists already have declared they will judgeMr. Bush's energy policy on his emphasis on conservation andrenewable energy. Budget constraints and the Bushadministration's marketplace philosophy have limited theoptions. But Bush advisers are recommending millions ofdollars in new research and development funding to promotepromising technology that will save energy or, for example,increase oil recovery.   Other measures would encourage states to acceleratescrapping of old gas-guzzling polluting vehicles, draw up newenergy-efficiency standards that could be adopted in statebuilding codes, and increase the use of mortgage-financingincentives for energy-efficiency improvements.   On the energy-production side, measures going to Mr. Bushseek to open the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge to oildrilling, accelerate oil production on Alaska's North Slope,streamline natural-gas pipeline regulation and revamp nuclearplant-licensing procedures.   The alternative-fuels consensus was worked out afterpolicy makers finally rejected a proposal to require oilcompanies to sell a certain percentage of alternative fuels.Also rejected in meetings over several weeks were mandatedproduction of alternative-fuel vehicles, an oil-import fee,various energy taxes, and new energy-efficiency standards foritems ranging from office equipment to small motors.   Mr. Bush's energy proposal is sure to have competition onCapitol Hill. Rep. Norman Lent (R., N.Y) and Senate Energyand Natural Resources Committee Chairman Bennett Johnston(D., La.) as well as others, are interested in introducingtheir own comprehensive energy-security packages.</TEXT></DOC>
