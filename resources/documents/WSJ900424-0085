Since 1973filers have been asked if they wanted $1 of their taxes to goto a presidential-election fund. Though they are explicitlytold that checking &quot;yes&quot; won't raise their taxes, the numberof people who want to subsidize White House aspirants isobviously diminishing. It fell from 29% in 1980 to 20% lastyear. Despite this overwhelming rejection, Washington isoverflowing with proposals at the moment to extend publicfinancing to Congress. Not surprisingly, no one is evensuggesting that the money be raised by giving taxpayers a&quot;vote&quot; on the matter with a checkoff system for congressionalelections. The results would likely be embarrassing.</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
