Richard B. Priory, a senior vice president of Duke Power Co.,said his company's analysis of the rule change _ which takes effectnext Thursday _ does not alter its view that ``nuclear power is notnow a viable option in this country.''   Priory told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee Thursdaythat while the rule change adopted by the Nuclear RegulatoryCommission was a step in the right direction, it did not go farenough in freeing utilities from legal entanglements.   ``The rule ... does not provide the necessary assurances that autility, having invested more than a billion dollars in a nuclearpower plant, will be able to operate that plant in a timely manner,or indeed, to operate it at all,'' he said.   Priory's main objection was that the NRC rule did not eliminatethe possibility of someone raising a legal challenge to a completednuclear plant after it had received its operating license butbefore it could begin running.   He said Congress should amend the 1954 Atomic Energy Act tolimit the possibility of such 11th-hour challenges, which in recentyears have stopped plants from opening.   Duke Power, which provides power in North and South Carolina andrelies on nuclear plants for two-thirds of its electricity, iswidely considered one of the most successful nuclear utilities.   The main aim of the NRC's rule change was to ensure thatquestions about the suitability of a nuclear reactor design, aswell as the plant's location, are answered before constructionbegins.   Lando W. Zech Jr., the NRC chairman, told the subcommittee thenew rule was ``a huge positive step'' toward reviving the nuclearindustry. He said the NRC had received no orders for new plantssince 1978, but that many new generating plants would be needed tomeet energy demands in the 1990s.   ``The commission is confident that the final rule as presentlystructured provides a sound basis for the efficient constructionand licensing of new, safe nuclear power plants,'' Zech said.   Dean R. Tousley, speaking for the Union of Concerned Scientists,told the panel that while his group favored speeding up thelicensing process, the NRC revisions go too far by limiting thekinds of issues that can be raised after a plant is completed. Hesaid the rule meant only design and site issues could be raised.   ``Where the commission runs adrift is in thinking that it canresolve all construction-related issues prior to construction, anddeny a hearing on those issues at the end of construction,''Tousley said.</TEXT></DOC>
