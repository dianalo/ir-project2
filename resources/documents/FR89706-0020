All written requests for information that are not processed underPart 1205 of the Board's regulations will be processed under this part.The Board may continue, without complying with the provisions of this part,to furnish the public with the information it customarily has furnishedin the regular course of performing its official duties, unless furnishingthe information would violate the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, oranother law. (b) When the subject of the record, or the subject's authorized representative,requests a record from a Privacy Act system of records, as that term isdefined by 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(5), and the Board retrieves the record by thesubject's name or other personal identifier, the Board will handle therequest under the procedures and fees applicable in 5 CFR Part 1205. Whena third party makes a request for access to those records, without theexpress written consent of the subject of the record, the Board will handlethe request under this part. (c) When a party to an appeal requests a copy of a tape recording or transcript(if one has been prepared) of a hearing that the Board or a presiding officialof the Board conducted under Part 1201 or Part 1209 of this chapter, theBoard will handle the request under 5 CFR 1201.53.

Other requests must be addressed to the Clerk ofthe Board, 1120 Vermont Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20419. Requests submittedunder this part must be clearly marked ``Freedom of Information Act Request''on both the envelope and the request. (b) <T3>Form. </T3>A request must describe the records sought in enough detailto enable Board personnel to locate the records with no more than a reasonableeffort. Wherever possible, a request must include specific informationabout each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient,and subject matter of the record. In addition, if the request seeks recordspertaining to cases decided by the Board, it must indicate the title ofthe case, the MSPB docket number, and the date of the decision. (c) <T3>Time limits and decisions.</T3> The Board will make a decision on arequest within 10 workdays after the regional office or the Office of theClerk receives it, except under ``unusual circumstances'' as that termis defined at 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B). Where ``unusual circumstances'' exist,the Board may extend the time period for making a decision on the requestby no more than 10 additional working days. When it does so, it will providewritten notification of the extension to the requester. If a request oran appeal is not properly labeled or is submitted to the wrong office,the time for processing the request will being when the proper office receivesit. The Clerk of the Board or the Director of any of the Board's regionaloffices may make a decision on a request.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1204.12 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Fees.</ITAG>(a) <T3>General.</T3> The Board will charge the requester fees for servicesprovided in responding to and processing requests for information. Thosefees will be charged according to the schedule contained in paragraph (d)of this section, and will recover the full allowable direct costs thatthe Board incurs. Fees may be charged for time spent searching for information,even if the Board fails to locate responsive records, and even if it determinesthat the information is exempt from disclosure. It will not charge therequester, however, if the fee for any request is less than $25 (the costto the Board of processing and collecting the fee).(b) <T3>Definitions.</T3> (1) The term ``direct costs'' means those costs thatan agency actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and in thecase of commercial requesters, reviewing) documents to respond to a FOIArequest. Direct costs include, for example, the salary of the employeeperforming work (the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 16 percentof that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplicating machinery.Overhead expenses, such as costs of space and of heating or lighting thefacility in which the records are stored, are not included in direct costs.(2) The term ``search'' includes all time spent looking for material inresponse to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identificationof material within documents. Searches will be done in the most efficientand least expensive manner in order to minimize costs for both the Boardand the requester. Searches may be done manually or by computer using existingprogramming.(3) The term ``duplication'' means the process of making a copy of a documentnecessary to respond to a FOIA request. Those copies can take the formof paper, microform, audio-visual materials, or machine-readable documentation(e.g., magnetic tape or disk), among others. The copy provided will bein a form that is reasonably usable by requesters.(4) The term ``review'' includes the process of examining documents todetermine whether any portion of them may be exempt from disclosure underthe FOIA, when the documents have been located in response to a requestthat is for a commercial use. The term also includes processing any documentsfor disclosure, e.g., doing all that is necessary to edit them and otherwiseprepare them for release. Review does not include time spent resolvinggeneral legal or policy issues regarding whether exemptions apply.(5) The term ``commercial use request'' means a request from or on behalfof one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial,trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalfthe request is made. In determining whether a requester properly belongsin this category, the Board will determine the use the requester will makeof the documents requested. Moreover, where the Board has reasonable causeto doubt the use a requester will make of the records sought, or wherethat use is not clear from the request itself, the Board will seek additionalclarification before assigning the request to a specific category.(6) The term ``educational institution'' means a preschool, a public orprivate elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate highereducation, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institutionof professional education, or an institution of vocational education thatoperates a program or programs of scholarly research.(7) The term ``noncommercial scientific institution'' means an institutionthat is not operated on a ``commercial'' basis as that term is used above,and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific researchwhose results are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.(8) The term ``representative of the news media'' means any person activelygathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publishor broadcast news to the public. The term ``news'' means information thatconcerns current events or that would be of current interest to the public.(c) <T3>Categories of requesters.</T3> There are four categories of FOIA requesters:Commercial use requesters; educational and noncommercial scientific institutions;representatives of the news media; and all other requesters. To be includedin the category of educational and noncommercial scientific institutions,requesters must show that the request is authorized by a qualifying institutionand that they are seeking the records not for a commercial use, but infurtherance of scholarly or scientific research. To be included in thenews media category, a requester must meet the definition in paragraph(b)(8) of this section and the request must not be made for a commercialuse. To avoid commercial use charges, requesters must show that they shouldbe included in a category or categories other than that of commercial userequesters. The board will determine the categories in which to place requestersfor fee purposes. It will make these determinations based on informationprovided by the requesters and information otherwise known to the Board.(d) <T3>Charges. </T3>The Board will provide all requesters, except commercialuse requesters as that term is defined above, the first 100 pages (papercopies of standard agency size) of duplication and the first two hoursof search time without charge.(1) When the Board receives a request:(i) From a commercial use requester, it will assess charges that recoverthe full direct costs for searching for the information requested, reviewingit for release at the initial request stage, reviewing it after an appealto determine whether other exemptions not considered prior to the appealapply to it, and duplicating it;(ii) From an educational and noncommercial scientific institution or, tothe extent duplication exceeds 100 pages, from a representative of thenews media, it will assess only charges for the cost of duplication ofthe requested information;(iii) From all other requesters, to the extent reproduction exceeds 100pages and search time exceeds 2 hours, it will assess fees to recover thefull direct cost of searching for and duplicating requested records.(2) When the Board reasonably believes that a requester or group of requestersis attempting to divide a request into a series of requests in order toevade the assessment of fees, the Board will combine the requests and chargefees accordingly. The Board will not combine multiple requests on unrelatedsubjects from one requester.(3) When the Board determines that charges for a request are likely toexceed $250, the Board will require the requester to provide an advancepayment of the entire fee before continuing to process the request.(4) When a requester has an outstanding fee charge or has failed previouslyto pay a fee on time, the Board will require the requester to pay any outstandingamount owed, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimatedfee before the Board begins to process a new or pending request from thatrequester, and before it applies administrative time limits for makinga determination on the new or pending request.(e) <T3>Fee schedule. </T3>(1) Fees for document searches for records willbe charged at a rate of $3.75 for each quarter of an hour.(2) Fees for computer searches for records will be charged at a rate of90 cents for each computer minute.(3) Fees for review at the initial administrative level to determine whetherrecords or portions of records are exempt from disclosure, and for reviewafter an appeal to determine whether the records are exempt on other legalgrounds, will be assessed, for commercial use requests, at the rate of$8.50 an hour.(4) Fees for paper copy duplication will represent the reasonable directcosts to the Board of making copies, taking into account the salary ofthe operator, as well as the cost of the reproduction machinery. Basedon these criteria, the Board has determined that the fee for photocopyingrecords is 10 cents a page, the fee for duplicating audio tapes is $5.75a cassette tape, the fee for computer printouts is 10 cents a page, thefee for records produced on magnetic computer tapes is $21 a tape, andthe fee for records produced on computer diskettes is $2.70 a diskette.When the Board estimates that duplication costs will exceed $25, it willnotify the requester of the estimated amount unless the requester has indicatedin advance a willingness to pay an equal or higher amount.(f) <T3>Fee waivers. </T3>(1) Upon request, the Clerk of the Board or regionaldirector, as appropriate, will furnish information without charge or atreduced charges if it is established that disclosure ``is in the publicinterest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understandingof the operations or activities of the government.'' Factors on which thisdecision will be based include:(i) The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requested recordsconcerns the operations or activities of the government;(ii) The informative value of the information to be disclosed: Whetherthe disclosure is likely to contribute to an understanding of governmentoperations or activities;(iii) Whether disclosure of the requested information is likely to contributeto public understanding of the subject of the disclosure; and(iv) The significance of the contribution the disclosure would make topublic understanding of government operations or activities.(2) If information is to be furnished without charge or at reduced rates,the requester must also establish that disclosure of the information isnot primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Factors on whichthis decision will be based include:(i) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furtheredby the requested disclosure; and, if so,(ii) Whether the identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficientlylarge, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosureis primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.(3) The requester has the burden of establishing eligibility for a waiverof fees or for reduced fees. The denial of a request for waiver of feesmay be appealed under subpart C of this part.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1204.13</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Denials.</ITAG>A denial of a request for reduced fees or of a request for waiver of fees,or denial of a request for a record, in whole or in part, will be madein writing, will state the reasons for the denial, and will notify therequester of the right to appeal the denial. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1204.14</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Requests for access to confidential commercial information.</ITAG>(a) <T3>General. </T3>Confidential commercial information provided to the Boardby a business submitter will not be disclosed in response to a Freedomof Information Act request except in accordance with this section.(b) <T3>Definitions. </T3>(1) The term ``confidential commercial information''means records provided to the government by a submitter that arguably containmaterial exempt from release under Exemption 4 of the Freedom of InformationAct, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), because disclosure could reasonably be expectedto cause substantial competitive harm.(2) The term ``submitter'' means any person or entity who provides confidentialcommercial information to the government. The term ``submitter'' includes,but is not limited to corporations, state governments, and foreign governments.(c) <T3>Notice to business submitters. </T3>The Board will provide a businesssubmitter with prompt written notice of a request encompassing its confidentialcommercial information whenever that action is required under paragraph(d) of this section, and except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section.This written notice will either describe the exact nature of the confidentialinformation requested or will provide copies of the records or portionsof records containing the commercial information.

(e) <T3>Opportunity to object to disclosure. </T3>Through the notice describedin paragraph (c) of this section, the Board will afford a business submittera reasonable period within which to provide a detailed statement of anyobjection to disclosure. The statement must specify all grounds for withholdingany of the information under any exemption of the Freedom of InformationAct. In addition, in the case of Exemption 4, the statement must demonstratewhy the information is alleged to be a trade secret, or to be commercialor financial information that is privileged or confidential. Informationa business submitter provides under this paragraph may itself be subjectto disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.  (f) <T3>Notice of intent to disclose information. </T3>The Board will considercarefully a business submitter's objections and specific grounds for claimingthat the information should not be disclosed before determining whetherto disclose confidential commercial information. Whenever the Board decidesto disclose confidential commerical information over the objection of abusiness submitter, it will forward to the business submitter a writtennotice that includes:  (1) A statement of the reasons for which the business submitter's disclosureobjections were not sufficient;  (2) A description of the confidential commercial information to be disclosed;and  (3) A specified disclosure date.
