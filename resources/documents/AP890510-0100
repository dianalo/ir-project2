During the first week of May, the communist guerrillas moved3,000-4,000 refugees from Ta Luan camp eastward along a routebombarded by artillery in April, the sources said.   In front of relief officials, they loaded the refugees ontoChinese-made military trucks along with their pigs and entirehouseholds, said sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. Otherrefugees walked. The 2,000 people left behind were mostly infirm orhandicapped.   The guerrillas evidently fear they otherwise will lose controlover the refugees, whom the United Nations had planned to move to anew camp where they could get medical and other services denied atTa Luan.   ``They're obviously playing games with people's lives and withus,'' one relief official said.   The Chinese-armed Khmer Rouge is the largest guerrilla groupfighting Vietnamese forces that invaded Cambodia in 1978 and oustedit from power. The Khmer Rouge government had killed hundreds ofthousands of people in execution chambers and slave labor camps tofashion a primitive agrarian society.   Relief officials charge that guerrillas in Khmer Rouge refugeecamps regularly deny people emergency medical treatment, forcechildren to carry arms through minefields and execute disobedientsoldiers.   Ta Luan is four miles inside Thailand's eastern Trat province,and is among four Khmer Rouge-controlled border camps aided by theU.N. Border Relief Operation. Relief officials said the Thaimilitary, crucial backers of the Khmer Rouge, do not seem anxiousto halt the movements from Ta Luan.   Negotiations with guerrilla leaders have been ``veryfrustrating,'' sources said. They quoted the guerrillas as sayingpeople must be moved because ``they are the soldiers' families andthe families must be with the soldiers.''   The guerrillas have been increasingly isolated by theinternational community as talks on ending the war have proceededrapidly in recent months. Khmer Rouge leaders have rejected allpeace proposals, and Western officials say they apparently havemade no attempts to end alleged human rights abuses.   The Khmer Rouge moved about 7,000 people from Ta Luan to theborder area in November, apparently to populate strategic areasinside Cambodia. Gunners inside Cambodia responded with heavyshelling, reportedly inflicting numerous casualties and forcingthousands of refugees back to the camp.   Relief officials say Khmer Rouge guerrillas often isolaterefugees because they want to make sure the refugees are not``polluted'' by Western influences and do not defect tonon-communist resistance groups.   Thai officials this week criticized a letter in which 94 U.S.congressmen asked that they take steps to end abuses in the camps,facilitate access by aid officials, and allow refugees to move toother camps. The officials and Thai legislsators accused thecongressmen of interfering in Thai affairs and insisted there areno human rights violations in the camps.</TEXT></DOC>
