In Portland, Ore., somecar-rental taxes have risen 50% from a year ago. Andinternational airline travelers may pay as many as fivedifferent taxes this year.   Taxation in travel -- it's becoming more common than highair fares were in the '80s. After once paying only a pittancein taxes, travelers are getting hit with a barrage offederal, state and city tax increases. This year alone, theywill pay an additional $2.5 billion in airline-ticket taxesand user fees. Hotel room taxes have jumped $500 million inthree years. And car renters and cruise-line customers arepaying taxes that didn't exist a few years ago.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Everywhere you look, there's a new tax for the traveler,&quot;says Rolfe Shellenberger, senior travel consultant forRunzenheimer International. &quot;I can't remember the industryhaving a tax hike this big before.&quot;   The explosion in travel taxes reflects not only the budgetwoes of federal and local governments but a political fact oflife: Travelers are an ideal source of revenue. Because thetaxes are so well disguised, most people don't notice them.And eagle-eyed tourists who shriek over them don't carry muchpolitical clout. &quot;You're taxing people who don't votelocally,&quot; says John Greenslip, a committee chairman forMeeting Planners International. &quot;They're easy pickings.&quot;   Some cities don't even have a pressing need for the newfunds and dedicate travel dollars to local concerts andfireworks displays. &quot;Most localities see these taxes as afree lunch,&quot; says Stephen Hiemstra, a professor at PurdueUniversity's restaurant, hotel and institutional managementdepartment. &quot;They figure travelers are so rich they won'tcare.&quot;   Years ago, travelers were taxed once for airline tickets,once for hotel stays and so on. The tax rates were usuallysimilar to single-digit sales taxes. Now, 80 airports havetacked on to any local sales tax a 5% to 10% &quot;off-airportcar-rental fee&quot; that gets passed on to renters. Cruisecustomers last year began paying a $3 federal departure tax.And most room taxes are well into double digits (Houston 15%,Chicago 12% and Dallas 13%). In recent months, New YorkCity's rate ballooned to 21% from 15% -- forcing some hotelsto call in security to quell irate guests.   &quot;I was absolutely flabbergasted,&quot; says Stephen Chappel, abank inspector who says he paid over $450 in taxes forstaying two weeks at the Vista hotel in downtown Manhattan.   The biggest tax changes in 1991 will be in air-traveltaxes. Domestically, the taxes on an $800 trip could amountto $92 -- a 44% increase from a year ago. Internationaltravelers will be paying user fees for everything from goingthrough customs to having plants and animals inspected. Formany people, connecting flights are already a hassle; now,they may have to pay as much as $12 extra because manyairports plan to assess a fee based on takeoffs this summer.   Big as the tax burden is, a lot of people won't know whathit them. On airline tickets, inspection fees are usuallylumped into one line item -- cryptically coded &quot;UX.&quot; And BillFleming, a 51-year-old New Yorker, says a Ramada Hotel in NewOrleans never gave him any advance warning about the city's11% tax rate. &quot;They mailed me all these lovely brochures, butnot a word about that,&quot; he says. A manager at the hotel saysit doesn't normally disclose the tax rate because &quot;everybodyknows about these taxes.&quot;   Strangely enough, truth-in-advertising laws have thwartedtravel companies that do try to disclose the taxes. AlamoRent A Car Inc. says a California state law essentiallyprohibits it from separating out new airport fees from itsadvertised daily rate. The law was aimed at preventingcompanies from running rates that didn't reflect bottom-linecharges. &quot;But it means nobody knows about these new airportfees,&quot; says an Alamo spokeswoman.   Many of the new travel taxes will finance airportexpansion and other important projects in travel and otherareas. A $2 Florida surcharge on car rentals is supposed tofund new roads and substanceabuse programs. Many cities areusing hotel taxes to pay down debt.   But far from any fiscal crisis, the wealthy hamlet ofOakbrook Terrace, Ill., has used its hotel tax to hold DavidCopperfield, Wayne Newton and Andy Williams concerts, not tomention an annual Fourth of July fireworks display. Townofficials insist the events -- which cost over $100,000 ayear -- promote tourism. But some hoteliers wonder how mosttourists would benefit from concerts held only a few times ayear.   &quot;It's great for the people in the town, but not thehotels,&quot; says Jim Karnuth, a board member of the DuPageConvention and Visitors Bureau.   In Lafayette, Ind., hotel guests chip in 3% of their roomrates to pay for a fabulously expensive -- and failed --production of the &quot;Battle of Tippecanoe.&quot; At a cost of $3million, the county of Tippecanoe built a theater solely tohouse an outdoor play about the 1811 Indian attack. Billed asa tourist magnet and a &quot;potential gold mine&quot; for countycoffers, the play filled only 19% of the new theater seatsand closed last month. But hotel guests will be paying offthe bonds for the theater until 1999.   &quot;This is the kind of thing a lot of towns are using thefunds for,&quot; says Mr. Hiemstra at Purdue University. &quot;It's atotal waste.&quot;   All this taxing may cost cities and towns a lot oftourism. According to one Purdue survey of 400 hotels, townslevying a 10% hotel tax can expect to see occupancy ratesfall three points. &quot;People may not know about the tax thefirst time they stay, but they learn real fast,&quot; says Mr.Hiemstra.   Already, for example, the &quot;Best of America&quot; convention ismoving to Tampa, Fla., from New York City next year -- partlybecause the 4,000 attendees were fed up with room taxes. AndTandem Computers Inc. took into account the hotel taxes inNaples, Fla., when it recently decided against holding alarge customer meeting there. &quot;A few percentage points maynot seem like much,&quot; says Kerrie Peck, the company's managerof corporate programs, &quot;but it's a lot when you're dealingwith hundreds of people.&quot;   ---                      Those Costly Extras                                                                                                          Airline taxes and user fees                                                                                                        Domestic                                                                                                        Ticket tax                             10% Passenger facility charge*             0 to $12                                                                                                        International                                                                                                        Departure tax                          $6 Immigration fee                        $5 Customs fee                            $5 Animal and plant inspection fee*       $2 Passenger facility charge*             0 to $6                                                                                                          *Expected to take effect later this year                                                                                                          Source: Air Transport Association</TEXT></DOC>
