These regulatory amendmentsenable the VA to bring its loan guaranty program into conformance withother Federal loan programs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>These regulatory amendments are effective August17, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Mr. George Moerman, AssistantDirector for Loan Policy (264), Loan Guaranty Service, Department of VeteransBenefits, Veterans Administration, 810 Vermont Avenue NW, Washington, DC20420 (202) 233-3042.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On October 13, 1987, the VA publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(52 FR 37973) a proposed regulatory amendmentto 38 CFR 36.4254(d) and 38 CFR 36.4312(e). Public comments were requestedon a proposal to provide for timely collection and deposit of the VA loanguaranty funding fee. A 15-day deadline from date of loan closing is establishedwith penalty and interest payments assessed for late payment. Please referto the October 15, 1987, <T4>Federal Register </T4>for a complete discussion of the proposed regulations.The VA received one comment on the proposal. The commenter expressed appreciationfor agency efforts to follow existing government policy as exemplifiedby the conduct of other agencies and believed that such consistency wouldeliminate confusion and facilitate lender understanding of VA's requirements.The commenter is concerned that adequate flexibility in assessing the latecharges be exercised in adjudicating individual problems in an equitablemanner in light of recent changes to the funding fee program. The VA sharesthese concerns; necessary precautions and administrative flexibility willbe exercised to protect lenders from late charges for errors that are beyondthe lender's control.The Administrator hereby certifies that these final regulatory amendmentswill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5U.S.C. 601 and 612. The provision concerning the assessment of late feesand interest against lenders will affect lenders only in those cases inwhich the lender fails to take timely action to deposit the funding fee.To prevent this from occurring, prudent loan guaranty practice dictatesthat the VA assess late fees and interest. Assessment of these late feesand interest will also assure that the VA Loan Guaranty Program is consistentwith similar Federal loan programs. As only a relatively small percentageof VA guaranteed loans are held by small entities, these final regulatoryamendments will not significantly affect small entities. Pursuant to 5U.S.C. 605(b), these final regulatory amendments are exempt from the initialand final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of sections 603and 604.The Administrator has also determined that these final regulatory amendmentsare not a ``major rule'' within the meaning of Executive Order 12291. Theywill not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more,and will not cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers orindividual industries; nor will they have other significant adverse effectson competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or onthe ability of the United States-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets.The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program Numbers are 64.114 and64.119.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 38 CFR Part 36</ITAG>Condominiums, Handicapped, Housing loan programs_Housing and communitydevelopment, Manufactured homes, Veterans.These amendments are made final under the authority granted the Administratorby U.S.C. 210(c), 1820 and 1829 of title 38.<ITAG tagnum="21">Approved: June 16, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Thomas K.
