But the Coca-Cola Co., maker of rival Minute Maid, complained.And a court eventually said the ad was false, because Tropicanajuice is not, in fact, squeezed directly from oranges into thecarton. It is pasteurized and usually frozen first.   With that decision, Tropicana Products Inc. became one of a longlist of companies to learn the hard way that a major comparative adcampaign that does not elicit a lawsuit is a rare creature.   Until the 1970s, television networks prevented advertisers frommentioning comparable products by name, forcing them to mumblepolitely about ``Brand X.''   Since then, however, the no-holds-barred approach to advertisinghas proliferated _ and so have lawsuits.   ``Every competitive advertiser should be ready to go to court,''marketing experts Bruce Buchanan and Doron Goldman warned in theMay-June issue of the Harvard Business Review. ``Once yourcompetitor files suit, you can do little to stop the process.''   Congress may have accelerated the lawsuits last year bystrengthening the fair advertising laws. In addition, companiesthat suffer real or imagined slights by competitors have growntesty and are now quick to shoot back in court.   Even if they lose, they figure, they may dissuade someone elsefrom trying the same thing.   Under the Trademark Law Revision Act of 1988, anyone whomisrepresents ``his or her or another person's'' goods or servicesis liable for damages.   That wording closed a loophole in the 43-year-old Lanham Act,which prohibited false claims about one's own products but did notmention ``another person's.''   Buchanan and Goldman, who are researchers at New YorkUniversity's Stern School of Business, say it is too early to tellwhether the tougher law will lead to a rash of lawsuits.   But they maintain there was no shortage of such actions underthe old law. They counted more than 60 judicial decisions incomparative advertising cases, half of them in the last four years.   Even that number is conservative, they say, because many morecases probably were settled out of court.   ``We have no absolute figures, but the activity in the courtscertainly seems to be increasing,'' Buchanan said in an interviewWednesday.   In many cases, a successful suit leads only to an injunctionbanning the offending ads from the airwaves or print media. But ifthe plaintiff can show harm, the stakes can be higher.   When Jartran Inc. ran ads touting its rental trucks, forexample, it put U-Haul International's competing trucks in thebackground so they looked small and unattractive. The ploybackfired when a court ruled the ads were ``deliberately false''and ordered Jartran to pay U-Haul $40 million in compensatory andpunitive damages.   But even claims that appear largely truthful have beenchallenged successfully.   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., for example, got in trouble when itsaid its Now cigarettes had ``the lowest tar of all'' brands on themarket, with only 2 milligrams of tar apiece.   That may have been true for comparable king-size brands. ButCarlton 70, a shorter brand, had only 1 milligram. Its maker,American Brands Inc., went to court and won.   Despite the pitfalls, advertising agencies like Ogilvy andamp; Mathersay comparative ads are more popular than ever, with manufacturersof pain relievers, pickup trucks and soft drinks constantly goinghead-to-head.   ``You have to be very, very sure of your claims,'' said MaryMcElyea, a spokeswoman for Chevrolet trucks, which has beenpounding Ford Motor Co. trucks in comparative ads since late 1987.   ``But if you're careful, it can be very effective. The name ofthe game is, cut through the clutter and make it clear to thecustomer why your product is better.''</TEXT></DOC>
