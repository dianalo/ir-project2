The settlement was the largest ever with the LaborDepartment's Occupational Safety and Health Administration,exceeding a $3.3 million fine that USX Corp. agreed to paylast month.</LP><TEXT>   The Arco Chemical explosion was one of many at chemicalplants and oil refineries in the past few years. Currently,OSHA is seeking to fine Phillips Petroleum Co. $5.7 millionfor an October 1989 chemical plant explosion a dozen milesfrom here that killed 23 workers and injured more than 130.Phillips is contesting the penalty.   Arco Chemical said it doesn't agree with all the OSHAcitations but feels &quot;its interests are better served byfocusing on improving workplace safety rather than bycontesting or litigating the differences it may have withOSHA.&quot; The settlement states that Arco Chemical's payment ofthe penalty doesn't constitute an admission that it violatedany OSHA rules. Arco Chemical, based in Newtown Square, Pa.,is 83%-owned by Atlantic Richfield Co., an oil company.   Gilbert Saulter, an OSHA regional administrator, said theagency is trying to send a message to the chemical makersthat their safety precautions need improvement. &quot;We aretrying to say loud and clear that we need to go beyond thestandards that we have,&quot; he said. OSHA is also working onupgrading its own regulations on plant safety, he said.   The blast decimated an area the size of a city block andsent a 48,000-pound tank cover into a parking lot more than200 yards away, OSHA said. The incident could have beenprevented if the company had taken adequate safetyprecautions and properly trained its workers, Mr. Saultersaid. &quot;There are several areas where better training may haveavoided the circumstances and therefore the accident,&quot; hesaid.   OSHA and industry critics have been focusing on theincreased reliance of contract workers in plants who, theysay, don't get the same training as company workers. Mr.Saulter said that at the Arco Chemical plant here, companyand contract workers received the same training, and thistraining was inadequate for each group of workers. OSHAalleged in its accident report that there were numerousinstances of plant workers who hadn't received propertraining for handling hazardous chemicals.   In total, OSHA charged Arco Chemical with 347 &quot;willful&quot;violations for failing to protect the 347 workers on siteduring the explosion, assessing a $10,000 penalty for eachworker. The agency also charged Arco Chemical with more thana dozen &quot;serious&quot; violations, which means the employer &quot;knewor should have known&quot; there was a workplace hazard.</TEXT></DOC>
