Budget deficits, they point out, are no higher now than in manyother years when measured as a percentage of gross national product.Besides, unless we go on another spending spree, they say, we mighteven tame the beast in the 1990s.   And, it is argued, the equally worrisome trade deficit already ison the way to being alleviated if not corrected, with export ordersbuilding and American companies showing daily evidence that they arecompetitive again.   On a larger scale, serious questions have been raised about theinevitability of the economic cycle. Isn't it just ``economicnature'' for expansions to be followed by recessions? Maybe not,some now say.   Some of the reasoning in regard to the less-cyclical nature ofthe economy is interesting if not convincing. Rather than havingnational or global downturns, it is argued, we have downturnslimited to regions or industries.   There is evidence, for example, that this very thing might haveoccurred in the U.S. economy over the past six years or so. Weavoided a national recession, it is said. Instead, regionaldownturns relieved the pressure.   Two years ago, for instance, many areas dependent on oil, mining,agriculture and certain types of manufacturing were indeed inrecession, but national statistics didn't show it because of Eastand West coast booms.   Thus, for official purposes, the country never had a traditionalrecession in this period. But sensible economic minds and millionsof Americans know very well that recessionary conditions existed formuch of the country.   Have the definitions and rules changed?   Old-timers will tell you that to toss out the old rules and thetraditional assumptions is a step toward disaster. Just as soon asyou get ready to abandon the old guidelines, they say, the oldguidelines reassert themselves.   They observe, for example, that abandonment of old measures ofvalues often accompany every explosive bull market in stocks, onlyto be embraced again as prices plunge back to reality.   Still, there remains an important area where existing measuresmight indeed be out of whack. Americans, it has been said fordecades, are among the world's worst savers, putting away only afraction of what the Japanese save.   From 1982 to 1987 the U.S. savings rate was a mere 3.7 percent ofgross national product, compared with several times that in Japan.Americans, it was said, were squandering their income instead ofinvesting it in progress.   But several economists point out that demographics might have hadsomething to do with this low rate. And others, most recentlyFederal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, suggest the definition ofsavings might be incorrect.   Edward Yardeni, Prudential-Bache director of economics, contendsthe baby boom bulge in the population, a phenomenon that is destinedto disappear, has skewed the conventional savings rate.   As the baby boomers _ born after World War II _ grow older theywill become less active spenders, he says. Their big expenses foreducation, housing and the like will have been met; they will havethe ability and desire to save.   So convinced is he that this thesis is correct, Yardeni has goneway out on a limb, forcasting a sharp rise in the savings rate from4 percent or so to 10 percent over the next five years.   Paul Craig Roberts, former Treasury assistant secretary, arguesthat there are methodological quirks in the calculation of savingsrate. And now Greenspan adds further doubts about the accuracy ofofficial savings rates.   Greenspan's question concerns a situation that, at least on thesurface, appears to be contradictory. Down payments by buyers ofhouses are counted as savings, but capital gains received by sellersof houses are not.   Count those capital gains received by sellers of homes that havemultiplied in value, and you might see a very different savings ratefor Americans. And a lot less criticism of their profligacy.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Thurs., Feb. 2.</NOTE></DOC>
