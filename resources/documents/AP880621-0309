The east Mediterranean island, which has been the center oftrade routes between the West and the Middle East for centuries,boasts the fastest growing shipping register in the world.   ``Our objective is to attract shipping-banks, marine insurers,lawyers and brokers through tax incentives and other facilities,''said Zenon Katsourides, recently appointed special shippingconsultant to President George Vassiliou.   The shipping register has grown from 1,487 ships and a grosstonnage of 9.6 million at the end of 1985, to 2,000 ships and atonnage of 17 million now, Katsourides said.   ``We want to be able to offer all the services peripheral toshipping by building on our existing base,'' he told The AssociatedPress in an interview.   The Cypriots recently announced plans to open offices in NewYork and Hong Kong to develop new markets for its shipping register.   Parliament is discussing updating all shipping legislationpassed in the last 30 years, and the government is expandingfacilities at Larnaca, a port on the south coast and the secondlargest on the island. It will eventually be able to handle 60,000containers a day.   Larnaca and the other major port of Limassol, 35 miles to thewest, lie in the Greek Cypriot sector of the war-divided island.   The major port of Famagusta was overrun by the Turkish Army,which invaded in July 1974. The Turks seized the northern one-thirdof the island, which is now a breakway republic.   Katsourides, 48, a self-made millionaire who retired from shipmanagement in London 10 years ago to return to his native island,bristles at charges that Cyprus is a flag of convenience.   ``To start with, 22 percent of the Cyprus registry tonnage isCypriot-owned, so we're a truly national flag,'' he said.   The rest of the tonnage is owned by Greek and West Germaninterests, each with 35 percent, with the remaining 8 percentbelonging to other nations, Katsourides said.   He added that the main attraction of the Cypriot registry isthat Cyprus shipping law is based on English maritime legislation``and is consequently accepted both by banks and insurancecompanies.''   In addition, this legislation ``is being constantly upgraded tosafeguard the interests of both the owners and the seafarers,'' hesaid.   Cyprus was recently elected to the board of the InternationalMaritime Organization, and has ratified all international maritimeconventions and agreements between owners and seamen's unions, hesaid.   The London-based ``Lloyd's List,'' a shipping industrynewspaper, said Katsourides' appointment was ``seen as a signal tothe shipping community around the world that changes to the Cyprusmaritime administration will be given priority.''   Katsourides' first moves after his appointment ``showed he isliving up to his reputation, won in the banking and offshoresectors, as being energetic and enthusiastic,'' the daily added.   Katsourides said Cyprus has already established itself as animportant offshore banking and business center.   ``Our intention to offer all the services peripheral to shippingwill not only prove beneficial for owners, but it will also benefitCyprus, he said.   ``It has a large number of professionally qualified people,including lawyers, accountants and engineers, familiar withshipping.''   He said the large potential for future development in Cypruslies in shore-based, shipping-related activities.   A significant number of shipping and ship-management companiesare operating on the island, while marine insurance companies andother agencies have established local offices.   One of the Cyprus-based ship-management companies is the WestGerman-controlled Columbia Ship Management Ltd. Chairman HeinrichSchoeller said his company employs 3,750 people, 250 ashore and3,500 on 125 ships at sea, 56 of which fly the Cyprus flag.   ``We're satisfied with the facilities offered in Cyprus and theadvantages of the Cyprus flag, and plan to use Cyprus as ourheadquarters for many years to come,'' he said.   Government revenues from shipping currently run to about 2million Cyprus pounds ($4 million), Katsourides said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions June 25-26</NOTE></DOC>
