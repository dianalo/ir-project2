Domiano Parasmo, 73, of Brooklyn, was taken into custody by apark enforcement patrolman Wednesday morning and issued a summonsfor violating parks regulations that make it a crime to trap birdsor animals in parks.   Bill Dalton, the Parks Department's chief of citywideenforcement, sent Parasmo home after he promised to leave thepigeons alone.   ``I told him I would check with the people who complained andmaybe we'll drop the charges,'' Dalton said.   ``(Parks) Commissioner (Henry) Stern doesn't want to prosecutean elderly gentleman,'' Dalton said. ``He wants him to stoptrapping pigeons.''   Parasmo has been issued summonses by the Society for thePrevention of Cruelty to Animals three times and in each case, thehearing judge dismissed the charges. There is no law againsttrapping wildlife on city streets, as long as it is done humanely.   However, Parks Department regulations say it is a crime to``molest, chase, wound, trap, hunt, shoot, throw missiles at, kill,remove or (possess)'' any bird from a city park.</TEXT></DOC>
