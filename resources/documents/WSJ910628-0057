And unless it is resolved quickly, foreignbankers here warn that the bank's long-term business may behurt.   A growing number of international banks say they havebegun severing credit lines or curtailing their dealings withthe BNL group. Now they are threatening to step up theiraction unless the bank agrees to take responsibility forforeign debts incurred by Agrifactoring, one of its units.</LP><TEXT>   Agrifactoring is the financial services arm ofFederconsorzi, an Italian farmers' cooperative, which nowfaces liquidation because of debts estimated at eighttrillion lire ($6 billion).   BNL strongly denies responsibility for the debts. It saysit is the victim of a situation it didn't create, and hassimply been caught in the crossfire of a dispute betweenforeign banks and the Italian state. Giampiero Cantoni, BNL'spresident, responded to the foreign banks with a tersestatement saying that BNL would &quot;resist all unjustifiedpressure, particularly concerning its indirect subsidiaryAgrifactoring.&quot; BNL's foreign-banking partners are shocked bythis attitude.   Last month, Agriculture Minister Giovanni Goria removedFederconsorzi's management, and appointed three commissionersto oversee a bailout. Domestic and foreign-bank creditorshave been asked to approve a voluntary liquidation plan forthe group. If this fails, a forced liquidation is likely.   Foreign banks have been angered by the government'shandling of the issue. They argue that Federconsorzi is anarm of the state and that all foreign debts relating to theproblem -- $400 million from Federconsorzi and $200 millionfrom Agrifactoring -- should be repaid immediately,irrespective of how the bailout is conducted.   BNL is caught in the middle of the dispute. The bank isone of the most exposed in the affair, because it has loansoutstanding to Federconsorzi and Agrifactoring totaling 463billion lire. But BNL also effectively controls Agrifactoringwith a 50% stake, of which 27% is held directly, and the restthrough its units Ifitalia and Efibanca. In the foreignbanks' view, this makes BNL liable for the money they areowed by Agrifactoring.   Several foreign bankers say they believe the ItalianTreasury, which directly owns 58.7% of BNL, probably will beobliged to step into the dispute, in the face of growinginternational pressure. But so far, it hasn't shown anyinclination to do so.   &quot;There are unwritten rules in interbank relations -- Inever saw a company owned by a bank which didn't pay itsdebts,&quot; says Gian Marco Petrelli, director general ofBritain's Barclays Bank in Italy and chairman of a committeeof Federconsorzi's foreign creditor banks.   Japanese banks are the most exposed, while most otherdebts are to European banks. One banking source said thatshort-term credit lines, totaling hundreds of millions ofdollars to the BNL group, had been suspended, and that theaction would be increasingly aimed at the parent bank.   Banks that have taken action include the three mainJapanese creditors, Sumitomo Bank, Mitsubishi Bank andDai-Ichi Kangyo Bank. Some European banks, while angered byBNL's stance, have preferred to postpone action untilprospects for a voluntary liquidation of Federconsorzi becomeclearer.   There isn't any doubt, however, that BNL's image ishurting in the international banking community. BNLindividuals confirm that a limited number of banks have takensteps against the Italian bank. But so far, they say, thishasn't affected the bank's operations.   Mr. Petrelli of Barclays agrees. &quot;It's mostly an imageproblem -- it doesn't seem that the action is yet so strongas to jeopardize their ability to trade,&quot; he says.   But that could change very quickly. International bankswere meeting in London this week to coordinate strategy onFederconsorzi.   International rating agency IBCA Ltd. already has putBNL's rating under review. The agency says that if the bankis forced to support Agrifactoring, its total exposure to theFederconsorzi problem could exceed $1 billion. While much ofthat eventually could be recouped through the expectedliquidation of the farming cooperative, at the very least itadds to the bank's short-term woes.   The new risk surfaces as the bank still grapples with theafter-effects of the 1989 discovery that its Atlanta branchmade $3 billion in unauthorized loans to Iraq. Iraq stillowes $2.3 billion, and interest payments on the debt havebeen interrupted since the Persian Gulf War.   Although it recapitalized in the wake of the Atlantascandal, restructured its management to improve supervisionof its sprawling businesses and raised total risk provisionsby 28% last year, the Atlanta affair continues to haunt BNL.   Investigations into the matter are continuing on bothsides of the Atlantic.   Last year, BNL reported group net earnings of 132 billionlire after a loss of 240 billion in 1989, the year theAtlanta scandal surfaced. BNL is anxious that its improvedbusiness operations aren't disrupted by the Federconsorziaffair.   Foreign bankers said that BNL's acceptance ofAgrifactoring's debt would enable normal business relationswith the bank to resume. But they warned that in the absenceof that, the situation could deteriorate rapidly.</TEXT></DOC>
