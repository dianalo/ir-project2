But Saudi officials denied any intent to leave theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, despitereports that Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, hadthreatened to do so during some of the heated debate overprices.</LP><TEXT>   Still, after two days of acrimonious talks, several otheroil ministers were sharply critical of Mr. Nazer for his rolein allegedly trying to hold OPEC's prices below the$21-a-barrel reference mark while pushing up OPEC'sproduction level for the fourth quarter.   The chief result of the meeting, which ended Wednesdaynight, is a new production ceiling of 23.65 million barrels aday for the fourth quarter. That is about equal to thegroup's actual daily output for September. The ceiling isintended to provide some stability to oil markets over thehigh-use period of the fourth quarter while accommodatingadditional volumes expected soon from Iraq and Kuwait.   It also locks in a share of 8.5 million barrels a day forSaudi Arabia. Early on, Mr. Nazer indicated he would hold toan earlier claim of such a share, whatever OPEC's totalvolumes were in the fourth quarter. &quot;Saudi Arabia willproduce what the market demands,&quot; he said. The kingdom hasbeen concerned that the recent surges in demand for OPEC oilcould cause a run-up in prices that could damage economicrecovery in the U.S. and other oil-importing nations. That,in turn, would contribute to an eventual slackening inpetroleum demand.   But many OPEC delegates were unhappy that Mr. Nazer had&quot;come with a predetermined position&quot; that was reiterated toreporters before the meeting began, said one oil minister whousually is a strong supporter of the Saudis. Also, OPECsources confirmed there was a stalemate between Mr. Nazer andthe Iranian minister over what action OPEC might take -- ifany -- toward advancing its oil prices, now averaging $19 to$20 a barrel, toward the $21 target.   Indeed, Gholamreza Aghazadeh, Iran's oil minister, and Mr.Nazer engaged in at least two hours of vociferous debate atone point, the sources said. Supported by several other OPECmembers, Iran's pricing strategy is that OPEC should do whatit can to move its average to $21 quickly. And some of thepricing differences between the Saudi oil minister and Mr.Aghazadeh concerned nothing more than the wording in a newsrelease OPEC issued after the meeting.   &quot;When we decided on a minimum reference price of $21, themeaning was very clear: We want at least $21,&quot; the Iranianminister said. But Mr. Aghazadeh told reporters yesterdaythat he was dissatisfied with Saudi Arabia's role at themeeting. &quot;In my opinion, Saudi Arabia didn't try tocooperate&quot; even though &quot;we had a very serious situation,&quot; headded.   Mr. Aghazadeh noted, however, that the agreement reachedhere requires a special meeting of the oil ministers toconsider production changes if the OPEC price averages lessthan $21 for a period of time. Also, he said, such a meetingwould be held if prices were to jump suddenly to $24 or $25,a possibility Saudi delegates have warned about in view ofthe rise in demand anticipated for the fourth quarter.Whatever happens to prices, the ministers will meet againNov. 26 for their winter conference.   Nordine Ait Laoussine, Algeria's oil minister, also hadsome comments regarding Mr. Nazer. A majority of the OPECmembers don't understand Saudi Arabia's position on prices,he said. &quot;We are in disagreement with Saudi Arabia on thebasic philosophy of what should govern the price,&quot; Mr. AitLaoussine said. And he asked: &quot;If the market dictates theprice, why don't we just go home?&quot;   Senior OPEC sources said a similar question on prices andproduction was raised by Libya's oil minister during a heatedexchange with Mr. Nazer. The Saudi oil minister is said tohave replied with a question of his own: Did the others wantSaudi Arabia to leave OPEC? That is a chilling prospect forthe rest of the cartel, given that Saudi Arabia is theworld's largest oil exporter and single-handedly producesmore than a third of OPEC's total output.   Last night, a Saudi official said the kingdom still thinksOPEC is &quot;a good and an important organization&quot; and has nointention of even considering pulling out of the group thatit helped to found. Still, the official added, &quot;We are notgoing to change our longstanding oil policies, which supportthe Saudi national interests and the stability of oilmarkets.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
