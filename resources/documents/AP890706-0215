His message is the same as it has been, ``Bad money drives outgood,'' and it applies today as it has since he stated it for thefirst time in the 16th century, when he was an adviser to QueenElizabeth I.   But Gresham's law is, for the most part, ignored. Like bad money,a spate of experimental thinking, still unproved, has moved in wheresound reasoning, demonstrated over the years, has departed.   Ignorance of the law, however, doesn't mean it has nosignificance. Indeed, it's significance has been shown again assurely as it was in Queen Elizabeth's day, when debasement of thecurrency damaged England's foreign trade.   For evidence of the modern application, you need only check whathappens to the once-secure bonds of sound companies after newer,junk bonds are issued in a leveraged buyout _ the value of the oldbonds falls.   James Creedon, president of Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., amajor holder of existing RJR Nabisco bonds, can attest to theirsudden decline in market value. The drop occurred when the companydecided to undergo a junk bond-financed leveraged buyout last year.Metropolitan has sued, so far without success, for reimbursement.   Junk bonds are said by their supporters to be as good as anyother _ even better. Their promoters claim that nobody can (as yet)demonstrate they are riskier. They pay very high yields to borrowers.   They are issued by borrowers often to raise funds for a leveragedbuyout of a corporation or to take over another company. They carryhigh rates because those who issue them can't otherwise raise themoney quickly.   In the RJR Nabisco deal, Creedon claims the issuance of junkbonds by companies that already have older, sounder bonds oustandingturns upside down some basic legal concepts governing the extensionof credit.   One of the most fundamental principles of corporate law, he saidin a recent speech, is that the claims of bondholders are superiorto the claims of shareholders.   Thus, he said, ``if a corporation is liquidated, the assets wouldbe sold and the proceeds would be used to pay _ first, thebondholders and other creditors, then the preferred shareholdersand, lastly, if anything is remaining, the common shareholders.''   In the RJR Nabisco leveraged buyout, he continued, substantiallyall the company's net worth was paid out to its shareholders and thebondholders received nothing.   ``The payment to shareholders was funded by enormous levels ofnew debt,'' he said. ``In effect, the interests of shareholders weregiven priority over the interests of the bondholders.''   Analyzing the situation, H. Erich Heinemann, chief economist ofLadenburg, Thalmann andamp; Co., states that the result was predictable:The value of $5 billion of existing RJR debt plunged.   Questions: What will future bond buyers say when salesmen askthem to invest in corporate bonds? Will they merely ask whatprotection they have from being destroyed by a sudden issuance ofjunk bonds? Will they decline to buy? Will they demand higher ratesfor assuming a greater risk?   Said Heineman: ``When LBO players change the rules in the middleof the game to suit their personal convenience (let alone theirpersonal pocketbooks), it's time for the public, taxpayers andinvestors alike, to beware.''   Said Creedon: ``High-quality, secure investments were turned intoa form of `junk.'''   And from the grave you almost could hear Sir Thomas say, ``Iwarned you: Bad money drives out good. It always has.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Friday, July 7</NOTE></DOC>
