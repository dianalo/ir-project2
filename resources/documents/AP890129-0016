Samir Abdullah, a Palestinian economist, says conditions couldworsen as the Palestinians continue to pursue their goal of ending21 years of Israeli rule in the occupied lands.   ``Don't think that money problems will bring the uprising to theend,'' he said. ``The Palestinian people are tasting the results oftheir struggle.''   Thousands of Arabs, heeding the demands of the undergroundleaders of the 13-month revolt, and have quit jobs in Israel,boycotted Israeli-made goods and staged frequent general strikes inthe occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.   Now the occupied lands are in a recession, private analysts say.   Abdullah said the lands' gross national product, the value of allgoods and services, shrank from $1.5 billion in 1987 to $1.2 billionin 1988.   For the 1.7 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,supporting the uprising has meant learning to live with less.   Ziad, a jewelry merchant in the Arab market of Jerusalem's OldCity, says his sales have fallen sharply in the past year because ofstrikes and the decline in tourists.   ``We don't earn enough to feed the family or even to replace thestock we do manage to sell,'' said Ziad, who asked that his lastname be withheld.   To cut expenses, he has moved his six children from private topublic schools. There is no money for new clothes, and he says hebuys meat for the family ``maybe once a week.''   Ziad says he will continue to support the uprising ``until wefree our homeland from the Israelis.''   Even traditional Arab hospitality, characterized by heapingsweets and coffee upon visitors, is being sacrificed.   Slogans on the walls of several Arab villages admonish: ``Oneglass of water will satisfy a guest.''   In Israel, the $35 billion economy grew a disappointing 1 percentin 1988, down from 5 percent a year earlier, according to governmentstatistics.   Unemployment among Israel's 4.4 million people has risen from 5.6percent to more than 7 percent since the uprising started inDecember 1987.   At the same time, the military is spending about $14 million amonth for the thousands of reserve soldiers sent to the occupiedlands to try to quell stone-throwing and other Palestiniandemonstrations, the Defense Ministry says.   Among the hardest hit industries is textile manufacturing, whichfell sharply last year because Arab laborers quit their jobs,according to a report by the Industry Ministry. Textile sales to theoccupied territories dropped more than a third because of thePalestinian boycott, the report says.   A Western economist who requested anonymity said one-quarter ofthe 110,000 Palestinians who worked in Israel before the uprisinghave quit their jobs.   The Industry Ministry reports that overall sales of Israeli goodsto the territories fell 70 percent last year to $140 million.   The nation's tourist industry expected a big year in 1988,Israel's 40th anniversary. But only 1.3 million people visited, a 14percent drop from 1987.   Mordechai Ben-Ari, the Tourism Ministry's spokesman, says thedecline meant a loss of about $250 million in foreign exchangeearnings.   In many hotels, more than 70 percent of the rooms are empty andthe Israel Hotel Association has demanded low-interest loans to keepafloat.   ``We can't keep on going this way indefinitely,'' Eli Paposhado,president of the association, told a hoteliers' convention lastweek. ``The government must help us to keep afloat until there arebetter days.''   But the government also is in trouble. The uprising has onlyadded to chronic problems such as inflation, an overvalued currencyand government-run industries that are finding it harder to competein the world market.</TEXT></DOC>
