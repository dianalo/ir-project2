Unlike most of the other tax bills of the 1980s, there is littlein this legislation to draw the concern of the average family. Mostof the changes are intended to clear up ambiguities or correcterrors in the 1986 tax overhaul.   But there are tidbits for some farmers, oil drillers, free-lancewriters, first-time homebuyers, banks and workers who receiveeducational assistance from their employers.   All told, the bill would parcel out tax benefits worth $2.3billion over three years. Most of the money to pay for thosebenefits would come from a higher tax bite on some corporations.   The House has passed a much larger bill, costing about $7billion. If the Senate passes its bill, negotiators would attemptto work out a compromise between the two versions before Congressadjourns for the year, likely by Oct. 15.   Also awaiting action before adjournment are two issues withmajor political importance in this election year.   One is the melding of separate anti-drug bills passed by theHouse and Senate. The second is final action on a Senate package ofparental leave and anti-child-pornography legislation that couldend up with a provision expanding benefits for child care.   More than 100 amendments to the tax bill are awaitingconsideration. One of the most contentious, written by Sens. GordonHumphrey, R-N.H., and William Armstrong, R-Colo., would deny a taxexemption to any clinic that regularly performs abortion.   Although opponents say they have the votes to defeat thatamendment, Humphrey and Armstrong could tie up the Senate for aconsiderable amount of time before the proposal ever reaches a vote.   One of the few points of controversy already in the bill isdrawing fire from tobacco-state lawmakers. It would require theTreasury Department to study what effect the tax on cigarettes hason reducing smoking-related health problems.   There is wide Senate support for the ``taxpayer bill of rights''included in the legislation. The chief sponsor of the bill ofrights, Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., says it is necessary to rein insome IRS employees who, he contends, have trampled on taxpayerrights.   The Reagan administration has opposed the bill of rights, sayingsome of its provisions would duplicate improvements already made bythe IRS while others would hamper the agency's ability to collecttaxes.   Included in Pryor's plan are requirements that the IRS fullyinform taxpayers of their rights any time a tax dispute arises andwaive any penalty that is attributed to relying on written advicefurnished by the IRS.   It would prohibit the agency from promoting employees on thebasis of how much tax they collect and extend to 30 days the 10-daywaiting period before assets may be seized to satisfy overdue taxes.   The tax bill has been more than two years in development. Theadministration and tax professionals have been urging passage toclear up uncertainties left after the tax code was overhauled in1986.   The push for passage picked up support this year when House andSenate tax committees added amendments exempting farmers andcertain other business people from paying the federal diesel tax onfuel for off-road use. Under a 1987 law, they are required to paythe tax and file later for a refund.   Other popular provisions in the bill would extend tax breaks forfirst-time homebuyers, corporate research, businesses that hiredisadvantaged workers, and workers whose employers provide themwith educational or legal assistance.   In the last quarter-century, Congress has passed _ andpresidents have signed _ major tax bills on the average of one ayear. Since President Reagan took office less than eight years ago,taxes were cut in 1981, raised in 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985 and 1987,and thoroughly overhauled in 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
