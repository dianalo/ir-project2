It was the first increase this year in the prime rate, whichbanks use as a benchmark for setting interest on a variety ofconsumer and corporate loans, and put the rate at its highest sinceit was 10.75 percent in late 1984.   The last increase, from 10 percent to 10.5 percent, was Nov. 28.   Chicago-based Continental Bank and Republic National Bank of NewYork were the first to boost their prime rates and soon werefollowed by Citibank, the nation's largest bank, Chemical Bank andother major banks.   Rates have been rising due partly to the Federal Reserve'stightening of credit in an attempt to curb inflation. The prime ratereflects a bank's costs of borrowing money, including interest itpays on savings accounts and certificates of deposit, and generallyreflects more subtle increases in other interest rates.   The rate is watched closely because bankers use it as a basis forcalculating interest on corporate loans and for determining manytypes of fixed and adjustable-rate consumer loans, such as homeequity loans.   Republic said it increased its prime because of its rising costof money. At Continental, Bank, the former Continental IllinoisNational Bank, officials said they wanted to bring the bank's ratesin line with those on money markets.   Chemical Banking Corp., which owns Chemical Bank, is the nation'ssixth-largest bank holding company.   Continental is owned by Continental Illinois Corp., the nation's14th-largest holding company, while Republic's parent, Republic NewYork Corp., ranked 27th in terms of total assets held June 30, 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
