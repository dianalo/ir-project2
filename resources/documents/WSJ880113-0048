An Alcan spokesman said reactivating the facility would raise the capacity of its Jamaican operations one-third, to 860,000 metric tons of alumina annually. He said Montreal-based Alcan and its subsidiaries have world-wide capacity to produce annually about 2.4 million metric tons of alumina from bauxite. Alumina is a raw material for aluminum.    The spokesman said the facility was closed in the early 1980s because of low demand and prices. He said it would take about two years and cost &quot;in the low tens of millions (of dollars)&quot; to reactivate it.    Talks about reopening the facility had been suspended because of a dispute over terms of the joint-venture agreement between Alcan and the government. Alcan said talks can resume because an arbitrator has clarified the meaning of the contract. The spokesman said Alcan, in the talks, is seeking more favorable tax treatment. </TEXT></DOC>
