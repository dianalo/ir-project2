Garcia</HL><DD> 11/12/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   Stock prices advanced in quiet trading yesterday as the U.S. dollar firmed.    Because banks and the government market were closed for the Veterans Day holiday, most market professionals didn't consider very significant yesterday's moderate gains in the stock market.    They noted that the equity market got some support from the U.S. dollar, which moved higher in domestic and overseas currency markets. Currency trading in New York was extremely light because of the holiday. There was also little buying demand from domestic and foreign investors, traders added.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 21.05 to 1899.20. Yesterday's advance came after three declining sessions, in which the industrial average lost more than 107 points.    The advance did extend beyond the blue chips, as 995 issues moved higher on the New York Stock Exchange and 587 declined. The Big Board's composite index added 1.40 to 135.46 and the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.90 to 241.90.    Big Board volume contracted to 147.9 million shares from 184.3 million Tuesday.    The Big Board said it will return today to normal trading hours from 9:30 a.m. Eastern time to 4 p.m. The exchange had shortened trading hours after the October crash to give member firms and the Big Board staff time to process the enormous number of transactions that resulted from the jump in volume.    Investor anxiety over today's report about the U.S. merchandise trade deficit for September also dulled yesterday's market activity. The memory of what happened last month when the August data were released is fresh in the minds of many investors and Wall Streeters.    News of a disappointing decline in the August trade gap pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average down nearly 97 points Oct. 14. The bond market and the dollar also tumbled. The turmoil of that day was followed by a stunning plunge of 508 points just three sessions later.    Twelve economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report expect the September trade deficit to have narrowed to an average of $15 billion. Their estimates ranged from $14.5 billion to $15.5 billion.    With expectations in such a tight range, many professionals, like Larry Wachtel, a market strategist at Prudential-Bache Securities in New York, are hoping that today's report will turn out to be &quot;a happy surprise.&quot;    In addition to the trade figures, more economic statistics will hit the market tomorrow. Data on auto sales for the first 10 days of November, as well as data on industrial production, producer prices and retail sales for October will be released.    Although House Majority Leader Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) said congressional and administration budget negotiators &quot;are getting very close to agreement&quot; on spending cuts and revenue increases for fiscal 1988, few on Wall Street were excited by his statement. &quot;We've had the same kind of talk coming from Washington since the budget talks began several weeks ago. We're kind of immune to it by now,&quot; said one equity trader in New York.    Despite the upturn in the broad market, takeover stocks continued to sink. Stocks involved in mergers and leveraged buyouts got slammed Tuesday after news that Southland had postponed a $1.5 billion junk-bond offering that is needed to complete its bid to go private.    The cautious market environment following the October crash is making it difficult for Southland to line up bond buyers so it can convert a temporary bridge loan, put up by Wall Street firms, into permanent financings. Analysts and arbitragers worry that other pending takeovers may encounter the same financing woes.    Southland, which lost 16 1/4 points Tuesday, recovered slightly, gaining 2 1/2 to 54. But stocks declined for other companies involved in pending transactions: Santa Fe Southern Pacific fell 2 3/8 to 49 1/4; Singer lost 5/8 to 47 1/2; Bell andamp; Howell eased 1/4 to 59 1/2; and USG fell 1 to 28.    Telex slid 1 to 50. New York investor Asher Edelman, who has made a $65-a-share bid for Telex, said he hasn't asked Shearson Lehman Brothers to deliver its commitment to provide part of the financing for his offer. Banque Paribas said it still believes it can arrange a syndicated loan for part of the Telex acquisition financing. Mr. Edelman said he was reviewing all aspects of the pending deal.    British Airways' American depositary receipts jumped 2 3/4 to 25 1/4 on the Big Board. The company plans to make a new offer for British Caledonian Group PLC following the British government's decision to allow it to proceed with its proposed acquisition.    U.S. airlines' stocks were mostly down. But analysts saw little impact from the Department of Transportation's first performance report on how these companies adhere to flight schedules.    Cray Research tumbled 4 1/8 to 66 7/8. At an analysts meeting in New York yesterday, a company executive said estimates of a 15% revenue growth rate for next year were a bit on the high side.    CBS closed up 1/4 at 165 1/4 after trading as high as 170 early yesterday. The broadcaster again said that no decision had been made on the sale of its record unit. As previously reported, CBS has been in talks with Sony Corp. of Japan about selling the division for about $2 billion.    Copper stocks moved higher as the price of copper for December delivery continued to sell at more than $1 a pound for the first time in nearly eight years, reflecting strong demand. Phelps Dodge rose 1 to 38 1/8; and Asarco advanced 1/2 to 23 7/8. The shares of copper companies traded in the OTC market also advanced early in the day, but fell back just before the close.    American Telephone andamp; Telegraph inched up 3/8 to 28 7/8 on more than 1.8 million shares. The telecommunications giant said that it plans to invest $3 billion in its world-wide network in 1988 and again in 1989. It also plans to nearly double the size of its digital long-distance network by 1991.    Becton Dickinson gained 1 1/2 to 51 1/4. Earnings for the company's fiscal fourth quarter, ended Sept. 30, rose to $1.02 a share from 74 cents a year earlier.    McDermott International lost 1/2 to 17 3/8 after the oil services concern reported a loss of $307.7 million for its fiscal second quarter, ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of $23.7 million a year earlier.    Fireman's Fund fell 1/2 to 28 7/8. The insurer adopted a shareholder rights plan, designed to thwart an unfriendly takeover.    Gulf States Utilities was unchanged at 5 3/4. The staff of the Louisiana Public Service Commission recommended that this financially troubled utility take a $1.4 billion write-off on the $4.5 billion cost of the River Bend nuclear plant because the costs were imprudently incurred. </TEXT></DOC>
