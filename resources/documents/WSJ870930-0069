Washington-based MCI currently provides direct long-distance service to 60 countries. The company will lease equipment from American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. to service about 140 additional countries.    MCI will introduce operator services initially for its credit card, permitting customers to make calls from any touch-tone or rotary phone in the U.S. Such calls now are possible only from touch-tone phones. Collect calling, trouble assistance and general operator assistance will be phased in during 1988, MCI said. </TEXT></DOC>
