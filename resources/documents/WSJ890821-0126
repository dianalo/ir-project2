The single ice cube was a &quot;mail fraud&quot; plea from Mr. Freeman. All other charges were dropped. And that plea is best understood as a scrap of paper for prosecutors to wipe the egg off their faces. They figured they had better get something out of the dirt they were given by admitted inside trader Martin Siegel in exchange for promising him a lighter sentence.    The original indictment alleged a conspiracy in which Siegel told Messrs. Wigton and Tabor that he was exchanging hot illegal tips with Mr. Freeman. Based only on Siegel's claims, Mr. Giuliani had Mr. Wigton handcuffed at his desk. Mr. Tabor was forced to spend a night in the slammer plus two years unemployed. When prosecutors last week finally decided they had no case against these two, Mr. Giuliani apologized, after a fashion, for his haste.    The single scrap, Mr. Freeman's plea bargain, deserves a close look. He'd readily admitted the following:    As Goldman Sachs's top arbitrager, he bought Beatrice stock and options betting that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts would complete its leveraged buyout. On January 7, 1986, he called Henry Kravis, who didn't indicate any problem, but Mr. Freeman says a snag was suggested by Mr. Kravis's &quot;tone&quot; and the fact that he was &quot;very abrupt and appeared anxious to end the conversation.&quot; At midday, a well-known arb sold his shares. First thing on January 8, Mr. Freeman started dumping Beatrice shares and options.    Then he got a call from Bernard &quot;Bunny&quot; Lasker saying he heard from another arb that the LBO was in trouble. Mr. Freeman called Siegel, KKR's investment banker, and told him he had heard there was a problem. Siegel asked for his source and then said, &quot;Your Bunny has a good nose.&quot; He didn't disclose the problem and Mr. Freeman didn't ask.    By the time of the Siegel conversation, Mr. Freeman had already unloaded two-thirds of the securities he sold January 8. On that day, Beatrice shares plunged from 47 1/4 to 43 1/4, on the news that KKR changed its offer from $43 in cash and $7 in preferred stock to $40 in cash and $10 in preferred. As it became clear this would not kill the deal, the shares recovered to 47 1/4 by March 4. In April, as the deal was completed, they traded as high as $50. Those who bought from Mr. Freeman on January 8 may have lost money or may have turned a profit, depending on when they sold.    The entire case against Mr. Freeman rests on the notion that Siegel's Bunny comment was &quot;inside information.&quot; But if there was any Boesky-style quid-pro-quo insider-trading arrangement, Mr. Freeman would not have been scrambling around trying to interpret tones of voice and cryptic Bunny remarks.    If anyone took seriously the notion that this is a crime, arbs would stop showing up for work. Their job is to compete for accurate information about the prospects for takeovers succeeding, and bring this information into the market as quickly as possible. They do this by using the phone. Arbs play a very valuable role. They often buy shares from shareholders -- including plenty of institutional investors -- who prefer getting the benefit of the price rise that comes with takeover announcements but who don't want the risk that the deal will fall through.    The only people we know who don't understand this elementary operation of markets are some federal prosecutors and regulators. In recent years, SEC officials seemed to think that anyone who has any more information than anyone else is a criminal -- which at any point in time could make anyone buying or selling stock a felon.    This plea bargain raises political questions about more than Mr. Giuliani's mayoral ambitions. The absurd plea forced on Mr. Freeman and the churlish admission of innocence of Mr. Wigton and Mr. Tabor are an indictment of prosecutors who care more about getting headlines than making solid cases. Does Attorney General Thornburgh think this is good policy? What does Richard Breeden, nominated to run the SEC, think of the exotic view of markets reflected in such cases?    There is only one way we can imagine to salvage anything from this misuse of prosecutorial power. Federal Judge Pierre Leval will sentence Mr. Freeman in the fall. We propose that Judge Leval order this punishment: Mr. Freeman should serve 1,200 hours of community service in the form of lecturing prosecutors on how markets work. </TEXT></DOC>
