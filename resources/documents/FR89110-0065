The changes affect several Call Report schedules and are being madeprimarily to aid the banking agencies in identifying and monitoring risksfor which adequate data have not been available. These risks emanate inpart from the ongoing expansion of bank powers, especially at the statelevel, which allow banks to make investments that were previously not permissible.Memorandum items covering an area of off-balance sheet exposure for whichno data are currently collected would be added at this time to fill thevoid prior to the anticipated adoption of other refinements to off-balancesheet item reporting in conjunction with risk-based capital. Another changerelates to information needed to measure the assessment base from whichall banks calculate their deposit insurance assessments. The proposed revisionswould, if approved, the effective as of the March 31, 1989 report date.These changes would apply to all four sets of report forms (FFIEC 031,032, 033, and 034).<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: December 30, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Robert E.
