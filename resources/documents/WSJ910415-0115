A growing debate over just how effective the Patriotreally was is about to become public tomorrow when the HouseArmed Services Committee holds a hearing on the controversy.</LP><TEXT>   At issue is the contention by a number of defense analystsin the U.S. and Israel, who say that bad Iraqi engineeringand plain luck were more responsible for protecting Israeland Saudi Arabia from Scud attacks than the Patriot was. Theynote that the casualties and damage caused by Scud attacksagainst Israel actually increased after Patriot batteriesarrived in the Jewish state.   &quot;People have gotten enthralled with the spectaculardisplays of fireworks&quot; with the Patriot, says TheodorePostol, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor whohas studied the Patriot for years. &quot;But when you strip awaythe hoopla, there's not a lot there.&quot;   The Patriot's many defenders in the U.S. military bitterlyreject the criticism, and say that the missile actuallyperformed better than expected under dangerous and difficultcircumstances. &quot;Without Patriot, we would have had monumentaldamage,&quot; says Col. Bruce Garnett, the Army's Patriot programmanager. Scuds &quot;would have fallen on troop concentrations,ports and airfields.&quot;   The stakes in the coming debate are huge. Dramatic scenesof Patriot intercepts, broadcast live by satellite, havepropelled the stock price of the missile's maker, RaytheonCo., and brought the company hundreds of millions of dollarsof orders for replacement and additional missiles. Aspokesman for Raytheon calls the Patriot's war performance&quot;outstanding.&quot; The missile's publicized success also has beenused to boost arguments for the Strategic Defense Initiativein the U.S. and the Arrow anti-missile project in Israel.   Initial reports during and just after the war suggestedthat only after the Patriots knocked dozens of Scuds from thesky in the first weeks of the war was Iraq forced to cobbletogether rickety replacements that couldn't hold together inflight.   But U.S. and Israeli military officials now say that fromthe first days of the war, nearly every Scud fired at SaudiArabia and Israel broke apart during its descent into thethicker portion of the atmosphere. Iraqi engineers tried todouble the 280-mile range of the Scud, U.S. rocket scientistssay, and didn't understand that the missiles would come downfaster and at steeper angles, breaking into as many as fourpieces. The Scuds &quot;just tore apart,&quot; says Col. Garnett.   A Patriot manager says that during the first Scud attackon Saudi Arabia, on Jan. 17, the U.S. satellite trackingmissile launches reported the launch of five Scuds. But aboutsix minutes later, as the missiles were descending overDhahran, they shredded so badly that Patriot radar screensshowed 14 different objects. The Patriot batteries,programmed to launch two missiles at every target, showeredthe Scud parts with 28 of the $600,000 Patriot missiles, themanager says.   Joseph Shea, an MIT engineering professor who until lastyear headed Raytheon's research-and-development efforts, saysthat the Scuds were a tougher target than expected becausethe separate Scud pieces traveled faster and had smallerradar images than a full missile would have had. The Patriotbatteries also had to learn to pick out the Scud warhead froma cluster of other parts -- which unintentionally acted asdecoys -- and concentrate fire at the most dangerous pieces.&quot;The Scud turned out to be a sophisticated target, almost allby accident,&quot; he says.   Over the course of the war, 158 Patriots were fired at 47Scuds that came within Patriot range. An additional 39 Scudslanded harmlessly in the desert or sea. In Saudi Arabia, theArmy says, three-fourths of the Scuds intercepted would havelanded in defended areas -- airfields, ports, and militaryinstallations -- if the Patriots hadn't destroyed them orknocked them off course. The Scuds fired at Saudi Arabiagenerally were packed with 1,000-pound explosive warheads;the ones aimed at Israel were equipped with 500-poundwarheads -- &quot;Scud lites,&quot; the Patriots managers dubbed them.   Robert Pfaltzgraff, the president of the Institute forForeign Policy Analysis in Cambridge, Mass., an SDI booster,calls the Patriot's record &quot;a very impressive accomplishment&quot;that &quot;augurs well for ballistic missile defense.&quot;   But other defense analysts say luck had as much to do withreducing Scud damage as Patriots did. By breaking apart highin the atmosphere, says Kosta Tsipis, an MIT physicist andweapons expert, the Scuds randomly veered off target. ThePatriots could have pushed them farther off course to an openfield or -- just as randomly -- toward a crowded building.&quot;The Patriots may have nudged a warhead out of itstrajectory,&quot; he says, &quot;but it's more probable that thetrajectory of the missile was disturbed during breakup.&quot;   Weapons scientists cite Israel as a laboratory to test theeffects of the Patriot. If the missiles were effective, theysay, Scud damage should have declined after the Patriotsarrived. But according to figures compiled by the Israelinewspaper, Ma'ariv, just the opposite happened -- damageincreased with the Patriots.   In the first four days of the war, when Israel wasdefenseless against missile attack, 13 Scuds landed inIsraeli cities, wounding 115 and damaging 2,698 apartments.During the remainder of the war, when six Patriot batterieswere in place, 11 Scuds attacked Israeli cities. FourIsraelis were killed, 174 wounded and 9,029 apartmentsdamaged. An additional 16 Scuds landed harmlessly outside thePatriot defense area.   Squabbles between Israeli and American Patriot operatorswere part of the reason for the damage, say officialsinvolved. In one instance, the order to fire wasn't givenuntil it was too late to hit the Scud. In at least one otherinstance, the operators fired the Patriots at such a lowaltitude that they followed a Scud part to the ground, wherethey all exploded. The Patriot wasn't designed to protectcities in Israel, says an Army spokesman, because it&quot;couldn't keep debris from landing.&quot;   The U.S. and Israel have wildly different accounts of thePatriot's success rate. The U.S. Army says it intercepted 45of 47 Scuds that came within Patriot range. Israeligovernment analysts put the intercept rate at less than 20%in Israel, and say they see no reason why the U.S. shouldhave had better success in Saudi Arabia. Raytheon says thereis a classified document, signed by the U.S. Army and IsraeliAir Force, detailing the missile's performance, but thecompany can't release it.   Clearly, the different assessment may reflect politicalagendas. Israel could be Patriot-bashing as a way to get theU.S. to pay for the Arrow, the Israeli anti-missile underdevelopment that would compete with the Patriot. The Armycould be Patriot-boosting to pave the way for more spendingon it.   But there also may be a legitimate dispute over what theterm &quot;intercept&quot; actually means. The Army defines a missileinterception as demolishing a warhead or pushing it out ofthe 15-mile circle defended by a Patriot, but it sometimesapplies the definition loosely. Mr. Postol, the MIT Patriotexpert, says a Raytheon tape extolling successful missileintercepts, produced before the war, shows one missile thatis hit by a Patriot but whose warhead continues on its wayunharmed.   Mr. Shea, the MIT professor who consulted for Raytheon onthe Patriot during the war, says the missile was mainly apsychological weapon, meant to convince terrified Israelisand Saudis, who were fleeing the cities, that theirgovernment could protect them from Scuds. &quot;The biggest thingPatriot did was give Israel a face-saving way of not goingafter Iraq,&quot; he says.   But Richard Garwin, a senior scientist at InternationalBusiness Machines Corp. and a longtime defense consultant,says the U.S. must decide to field a weapon based on ananalysis of whether it works effectively, not whether itmakes citizens feel good. He warns: &quot;You shouldn't deceiveyourself.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
