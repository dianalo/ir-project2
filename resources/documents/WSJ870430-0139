LOUIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Edison Brothers Stores Inc. said it agreed in principle to purchase the J. Riggings division of U.S. Shoe Corp. Terms weren't disclosed.    The retail concern said the addition of J. Riggings will give it entree into a market segment that is somewhat older and more interested in updated traditional clothing than its Jeans West and Oak Tree division. J. Riggings, which operates 218 menswear stores, had sales last year of more than $90 million.    Edison said the transaction is expected to be completed at the end of June.    U.S. Shoe didn't say how much it would get for the division, but said the purchase price would exceed the unit's book value. The Cincinnati-based retail and shoe concern said the sale would enable it to concentrate on its optical and women's apparel retailing operations, as well as opportunites in the footwear business. </TEXT></DOC>
