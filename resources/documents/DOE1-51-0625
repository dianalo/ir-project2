<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-51-0625 </DOCNO><TEXT>To solve a variety of Engineering problems Integrated Civil EngineeringSystem (ICES) developed at M.I.T., Cambridge, provides subsystems writtenin different problem-oriented languages like STRUctural Design Languagte(STRUDL), ICES-FORTRAN (ICETRAN), COordinate GeOmetry (COGO) etc. EachICES Subsystem consists of commands which calls for a corresponding seriesof computer programs to perform the requested operations on the engineeringdata. The ICETRAN programming language is an extension and expansionof FORTRAN that allows users to link/edit and execute specific modulesof an ICES subsystem based on command oriented input data. This paperenumerates the translation procedures to convert ICETRAN commands intothe conventional FORTRAN statements and the method adopted to implementthe special features of ICETRAN like dynamic memory allocation, datamanagement and dynamic programs linkages.</TEXT></DOC>
