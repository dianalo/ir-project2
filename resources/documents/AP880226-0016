Political experts say a string of controversial pronouncementsthat would have damaged most politicians has only strengthenedRobertson's ties with his natural following, conservative Christianfundamentalists.   ``My guess is that Pat is deliberately playing to his SouthCarolina constituency,'' says University of Virginia sociologistJeffrey Hadden, a Robertson biographer. ``He doesn't care if folksin New York or Chicago or Los Angeles think he's crazy at thispoint. If he can get the press bashing him a bit, it would helpignite his followers.''   But Republican consultant Ed Mahe disagrees: ``I can't believethis reflects any kind of strategy. What we have here is atalk-show host here who doesn't understand the power of talk; afterall, when you're a talk-show host you toss these things out and whocares.''   Even Ronald Reagan, who has often stood corrected, ridiculedRobertson's claim that his Christian Broadcasting Network hadinformation about the location of hostages in the Middle East.   ``Isn't it strange that no one in our administration was everapprised of that?'' asked the president at his news conferenceWednesday.   Robertson bounced back, saying he could not understand the bigflap. ``I used that as a throwaway line,'' he said.   He also complained Wednesday in the Atlanta Constitution thathe's being put under undue scrutiny.   ``The press of the nation is holding me to an incrediblestandard of conduct,'' he said. ``They want me every time I open mymouth to be accompanied by a press aide, a lawyer and a librarianwith at least a thousand volumes to back up every word I've said.''   Just as Robertson's campaign has weathered the hostage crisisthis week, it weathered the missile crisis earlier this month _when Robertson claimed there were Soviet missiles in Cuba.   The Pentagon denied it, the White House denied it, even FidelCastro denied it. Robertson shrugged off the outcry, saying hehoped those doing the denying were right.   Robertson also suggested he saw the sinister hand of VicePresident George Bush behind the timing of the disclosures ofsexual misbehavior by a fellow fundamentalist preacher, JimmySwaggart. And he accused television anchorman Tom Brokaw ofengaging in ``religious bigotry'' when he referred to Robertson, aformer television evangelist, as a former television evangelist.   Stephen Hess, a Brookings Institution student of the press andpolitics, says Robertson's ability to weather attacks on hiscredibility _ ``the Teflon factor'' _ exists because the press hasbeen easy on him.   ``The media gets tough on people when they become important,''he says.   Adds Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University ofVirginia who has followed Robertson for decades: ``The otherRepublican candidates are hesitant to attack him. Even Bush hisdone so gingerly. The Republicans know they need his constituencyin the fall; they know these people are easily offended and willstay permanently offended.''   Moreover, he says, reporters, with few evangelical Christians intheir ranks, are shy about attacking Robertson: ``They know they'resubject to a charge of cultural bias.''   ``At first he was getting a good press,'' says Hess. ``There wasa surprise about Robertson. We expected Elmer Gantry and instead wegot Robert Young.''   The more the press challenges Robertson, the more his naturalconstituency _ Christian fundamentalists _ rallies around, saysAnson Shupe, an Indiana sociologist and co-author with Hadden of aforthcoming book, ``Televangelism: Power and Politics in God'sCountry.''   ``He's playing to a different audience,'' says Shupe. ``There isa real conspiratorial, paranoid theme running through fundamentalChristianity. They see the world almost as a conspiracy againstChristians. What to someone else may look like a way-out statementplays a lot better with his following and may even help him.''   But, says Shupe, Robertson's unproven statements will isolateRobertson from mainstream voters. ``Ultimately this could be hisupending,'' he says.</TEXT></DOC>
