Johnson, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, told a Cato Institute conference that he had new indicators for monetary policy: commodity prices, the dollar exchange rate and the term structure of interest rates. On Aug. 9 none of the three signals indicated a need for tighter policy.    So what happened? The Federal Reserve Board raised the discount rate from 6% to 6 1/2%, easily the Fed's most significant move to tighter money in 1988. The vote, moreover, was unanimous.    Clearly, the Johnson sign language isn't giving entirely accurate messages these days. And that's a problem for borrowers and investors trying to predict when and at what level the Fed will decide interest rates have risen enough. So the search is on for other indicators that the governors may be paying more attention to.    Meanwhile, concern is mounting that a new discount rate boost may become necessary, a move that, if reaction to the last increase is any guide, could unsettle the stock and bond markets.    The Fed moved to tighten money last April, when it began to allow a rise in the federal funds rate, the fee banks charge one another on overnight loans of reserves. The central bank controls the supply of bank reserves by buying or selling Treasury securities in the market, so its actions can strongly influence the funds rate. The long rise in the funds rate, shown in the chart below, put it well above the discount rate, which is the fee that the Fed charges on its loans to banks. By August, the discount rate had become such a bargain relative to the funds rate that banks were taking advantage of it, so the discount rate had to be raised, says Jerry L. Jordan, chief economist of First Interstate Bancorp.    The funds rate has continued to rise since Aug. 9, so it's almost as far above the discount rate as it was before the discount fee was increased -- raising the specter of yet another discount increase. Mr. Jordan suggests that now would be a fine time to float the discount rate, letting it fluctuate at a level a fraction above a short-term market rate. Such a step would remove policy significance from discount-rate changes.    It would, however, leave analysts still perplexed about how the Federal Reserve does make policy. Maury Harris, a PaineWebber economist, is convinced the Fed's prime concern is the above-trend growth of the inflation-adjusted gross national product. &quot;The 5% real GNP growth over the four quarters of last year was almost double long-term average growth,&quot; he notes. Although real GNP growth slowed in the first half of 1988, Mr. Harris says it was &quot;an only temporary inventory correction.&quot;    Mr. Harris believes the Fed is also disturbed by the first stirrings of a rise in labor costs, as well as a faster rise in producer prices for domestically manufactured intermediate materials and supplies, excluding food and energy.    Although interest rates still appear to be central to Federal Reserve thinking, Mr. Jordan is convinced that the central bank also is watching total bank reserves. The growth of reserves decelerated between April and July, a fact that has helped to keep the broader monetary aggregates, M2 and M3, within the Fed's target ranges.    Nearly all economists are convinced the Fed is sincere in its commitment to head off inflation. It is, moreover, moving more quickly than has usually been the case in the past. &quot;Someone once said that Fed officials didn't fight inflation until they saw the whites of its eyes,&quot; Karl Brunner of the University of Rochester recalls. That approach often led to a deep recession.    How will the Federal Reserve decide that it has done enough to head off inflation? At the monetary policy hearings in Congress in July, Chairman Alan Greenspan said that &quot;a leveling of unemployment and capacity utilization rates is essential&quot; to prevent an intensification of inflationary pressures. Such a leveling-off would go along with a slowing of the economy.    However, Douglas J. Schwindewolf, a Smith Barney, Harris Upham economist, warns, &quot;Once this leveling is realized, we would not immediately draw the conclusion that the Fed would reverse the present course of policy, because a decline in the capacity utilization rate and some rise in the unemployment rate are needed to reduce inflationary pressures.&quot; But a leveling, he believes, would indicate the Fed policies were beginning to bite. </TEXT></DOC>
