(column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Katt, Spencer F.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>Rumor Central drew record reader response last week, as Spencerian soldierseverywhere reached for the phone to inform their furry leader of theirspelling checkers' spooky associations.andM;A user of Microsoft Word for the Mac spell-checked the term ''IIGS,'' as inApple IIGS, to find that the spell-checker saw the word ''pigs.'' Aspell-check of ''IBM'' suggested the word ''bomb,'' a clear reference to theConvertible and PCjr.andM;Others called to relate tales of the mysterious clone maker Micro 1, recentlybankrupt and behind on its shipments, but now recovering and still takingorders for those under-$2,000 386 machines.andM;Most of all, the masses rose to the bait -- quite deliberately laid by thecagey Katt -- that IBM's REXX was a screen editor, when he knew all the whilethat REXX is, of course, IBM's official SAA procedural language.andM;Slippery Spence's strategy smoked out a fresh battalion of news gatherers, tobe assembled and airdropped at a moment's notice over whatever news target hedesignates.andM;A gliderfull will soon be dispatched to a remote airstrip alongside a Zenithmanufacturing plant in dusty Chihuahua, Mexico, where workers are slaving tobuild a fist-sized junction box that lets Zenith PCs capture game software,financial data and home-shopping info from a standard coaxial TV cable.andM;Zenith hopes to be the first to profit from the inevitable joint venturesbetween cable TV operators and information providers such as CompuServe andThe Source, posited the Wired One.andM;Most forward-thinking companies lurch at such chances to expand their appeal-- but not always.andP;  Take, for example, the people of Apple, generally seen asinnovation incarnate.andP;  SAS Institute has apparently revved up its quest toplace its statistics software on the Mac platform, but for that to happen,Apple would have to divulge to SAS some of its systems-software secrets,something that John Sculley can't bear to do.andM;Meanwhile, the base units for Compaq's SLT-286 are still backlogged, Spencerreports, with little chance for increased supplies anytime soon.andM;Baby, It's Cold OutsideandM;Delivering products isn't the issue over at Borland International -- it'swhich products to push.andP;  Faced with a Pyrrhic marketing campaign to dethroneMicrosoft's QuickBASIC, Borland has developed cold feet over whether toannounce the almost-complete Turbo BASIC version 2.andM;This is not to say that Borland will quit selling or supporting Turbo BASICversion 1, noted the Puss.andP;  But as one Borlander put it, Philippe makes hisdo-re-mi on Paradox, Quattro, Pascal and C, and the rest of his products aremerely in tow.andM;Spencer has always been fascinated with the lot of top managers who denouncethose who penetrate their firms but covet the inside dope on competitors.andO;And occasionally, they actually go out and get it.andM;That is what Acer did last week.andP;  When the firm's braintrust realized thefolks at Everex could process and ship a customer's order within three days,Acer wanted to know how they did it.andP;  So an Acer envoy drove to Fremont, meta friend of his who worked at Everex and got a friendly Cook's tour.andP;  Lookfor improved Acer customer service, coming soon.andM;This week's Rumor Central wouldn't be complete without acknowledging Novell'slargesse at last week's NetWare 386 announcement before 250 analysts,journalists and other sycophants and hangers-on.andP;  As he demonstrated one of100 nifty things about NetWare 386, a Novell-employed emcee announced that''even Spencer F.andP;  Katt would be impressed.andP;  Are you awake, Spencer?andP;  Someoneplease poke the pondering Puss, will you?''andM;''Flattery will get you everywhere'' is one of Spencer's mottoes, but heknows he's nowhere without your weekly CARE package of news nuggets.andM;Send yours Spencer's way -- in return for a Katt gym bag -- at (617)375-4000, or to his MCI mailbox, SKATT.. .andP;  .
