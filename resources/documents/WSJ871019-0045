But nobody expected what actually happened. By the end of last week, what had begun some two months before as a tame decline in stock prices had degenerated into a terrifying rout.    Last week alone, the aggregate value of U.S. publicly held companies' stock slumped more than $300 billion -- almost 10%. Shortly before the close Friday, the industrial average was off 130 points on the day, and it closed down a record 108.35 points, to 2246.74. Trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange hit a record 338.5 million shares.    &quot;When you go home tonight, walk close to the buildings,&quot; sardonically advised John Gavin, an official of a proxy-solicitation firm. As trading approached the closing bell Friday afternoon, a trader in stock-index options on the American Stock Exchange floor shrieked, &quot;It's the end of the world!&quot;    Not quite. By 8 p.m. at Harry's bar, the Wall Street watering hole, hordes of yuppie brokers and traders clearly were preoccupied with getting dates for the evening rather than with the market carnage. &quot;They've never seen a sick market before,&quot; an over-the-counter stock trader said. &quot;They think it's going back up a hundred points on Monday.&quot;    The odds are against that, but analysts spent the weekend trying to figure out where the market is going next. Although no one is forecasting a crash like that in 1929-30, there's a growing consensus that the bull market is seriously, if not mortally, wounded. Nevertheless, some see the next 300-point move in the industrial average taking the market back up the 2500 level rather than down to 1900.    A principal argument in the bullish case: The market has weathered setbacks this rough before. The industrial average's 17.5% decline since setting a record on Aug. 25 is only a tad worse than its 15.6% downturn in 1984 -- from which the market rebounded spectacularly. And even after Friday's plunge, moreover, the average is about 350 points higher than where it began this year.    In addition, the economy is undeniably growing without a significant increase in inflation. Many economists predict 3% economic growth both this year and next, with no recession in sight, they say, until 1989. Inflation barometers still show only moderate price pressures; the index of producer prices rose 0.3% in September after being unchanged from August. All this points toward continued gains in corporate profits, bullish analysts say.    Finally, a lot of money is still sloshing around the world in search of attractive investments. The U.S. stock market has been a big beneficiary of foreign capital inflows in recent years. And if U.S. stocks looked cheap to foreign investors when the industrial average was at 2700, optimistic analysts contend, they should be even more appealing now.    Arguing for a market decline, in contrast, are several considerations. One is the surprisingly rapid rise in interest rates in an economy that otherwise isn't showing signs of overheating. Yields on long-term Treasury bonds are well over 10% for the first time in two years, and they are persuading many pension funds and other big investors to switch out of stocks and into bonds. And if interest rates keep rising, the economic expansion could be snuffed earlier than expected.    Elaine Garzarelli, Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s director of market-sector analysis, says she expects that long-term bond yields may continue to hover between 10% and 11% and that &quot;the Dow could be as low as 1900 next February.&quot;    Another bearish force is the declining U.S. dollar, which has helped sell American products overseas. Further declines, which are being widely predicted, would boost exports even more. But any major drops in the dollar would scare away foreign investors, who would see their securities profits more than offset by currency-translation losses. If foreign investors walk away, bond prices could fall and interest rates, which move inversely to bond prices, could be pushed still higher.    Finally, investor sentiment has perceptibly moved away from enthusiasm and toward caution, if not downright pessimism. One way this change shows up is the grumpy reaction to the current flood of third-quarter corporate earnings reports. For instance, investors pounded the shares of International Business Machines Corp. last week because its 12% profit increase in the quarter wasn't up to their expectations. Even Apple Computer Inc.'s shares fell despite a much bigger-than-expected 54% gain.    This shift in investor sentiment may be hardening into a lack of confidence in the ability of the lame-duck Reagan administration or the Federal Reserve Board under its new chairman, Alan Greenspan, to deal with political and economic problems. Some institutional clients told Shearson's Ms. Garzarelli their stepped-up selling was partly motivated by a growing belief &quot;that Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve have lost control of the bond market and the economy,&quot; she says.    How all these factors shake out remains to be seen, of course, and most analysts are pointedly not making short-term predictions. Even optimists voice some concern that the steep slide of the past two weeks, and particularly Friday's sell-off, will produce a snowballing slide.    So, although many clients of Abby Cohen, a Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. investment strategist, believe that the sellers are overreacting, she says, &quot;They don't want to fight the trend. The bulls are backing off, and the bears are running wild. What's happened is a loss of faith.&quot;    Similarly, Robert Prechter, the most celebrated of the current crop of stockmarket gurus, was telling his telephone call-in clients late Friday that the selling spree is grossly overdone. However, he added that the market has been falling so dangerously fast that the clients should &quot;stand aside&quot; and await his next update, at 10:30 a.m. today.    The market could start snowballing if, for instance, mutual-fund investors deluge funds with orders to get them out of stocks and into money-market accounts. Funds selling stocks to meet redemption orders could touch off another round of declines.    Others are more worried about ominous side effects of certain institutional trading maneuvers involving stocks and stock-index futures and options. In a falling market, these maneuvers can feed on each other and produce wave upon wave of selling. And market regulators so far have been loath to interfere.    In any event, few analysts expect an immediate, rubber-band snapback. Some predict cautious, erratic trading that might drag on for weeks or months before a broad, strong advance becomes possible again. &quot;It was a huge correction, but it was needed very, very badly,&quot; says Joel L. Lovett, who heads a specialist firm on the American Stock Exchange. &quot;Now, I think the correction is over, and the market will be flat for a while.&quot;    Others are far gloomier. Charles L. Clough, Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.'s chief investment strategist, says that the five-year bull market died in August and that &quot;we have entered a cyclical bear market.&quot; However, he also sees another bull market likely to begin as early as mid-1988. By then, he explains, the broadest measure of the nation's money supply will again be growing faster than the gross national product -- heralding another bull market, he says.    Though investment advisers don't agree on any hierarchy of specific developments that could sway the market in the weeks ahead, there's a rough consensus that they lie in three main areas -- interest rates, economic news and investor sentiment.    Interest Rates   If resurgent inflation isn't a credible fear, why are interest rates ratcheting higher? Wall Street's suspicions and Washington's reassurances are far apart, but the question and whatever the answer turns out to be have important implications for the stock market.    Some Wall Street money managers and economists believe that the Fed's half-point increase in its lending rate to member banks just before Labor Day was the kick-off of a long-term commitment to support the dollar through a tight-credit policy that will keep rates high indefinitely. In such an environment, almost any growth in economic activity would quickly translate into pressure on interest rates and, sooner or later, growth would be strangled, strategists reason.    While Fed Chairman Greenspan remained quiet over the weekend about the central bank's plans, Treasury Secretary James Baker made it clear in a Saturday television interview that he doesn't expect any further tightening by the Fed.    John Connolly, chief investment strategist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., suggests that Washington abandon the February 1987 Paris accord to support the dollar at then-current levels. He says that supporting the dollar at lower levels against the Japanese yen and West German mark -- essentially devaluing the U.S. currency -- would allow the Federal Reserve to let interest rates fall and remove any threat of recession.    But Secretary Baker also denied a Sunday newspaper story that the administration plans to let the dollar fall lower against the mark, a tactic that some analysts argue would backfire anyway. In the long run, warns E. Wayne Nordberg, head of the investment policy committee at Prescott Ball andamp; Turben in New York, &quot;currency devaluation always leads to higher inflation&quot; which, of course, begets higher interest rates and lower stock and bond prices.    The Economy   Bulls are hoping that continued steady growth, plus some indisputable sign of progress on the big U.S. trade and budget deficits, will rekindle stock buying.    On TV yesterday, Secretary Baker noted that figures due out Thursday will show the fiscal 1987 deficit at roughly $150 billion to $155 billion, down sharply from last year's $221 billion. And he said that even if the administration and Congress don't agree on a deficit-cutting package for fiscal 1988, the new Gramm-Rudman law will cut $23 billion in spending automatically.    That $23 billion figure is deceptive, however. The cuts will be made from a baseline significantly higher than actual 1987 spending levels. Even with the cuts, the fiscal 1988 deficit may end up far bigger than fiscal 1987's. And, at the moment at least, the president appears unwilling to consider even a small tax increase, which many consider needed in any deficit-cutting package.    Secretary Baker, who as recently as a month ago still thought the administration and Congress might be able to negotiate a deficit-cutting package, was asked over the weekend whether any of the provisions in the roughly $12 billion congressional tax-increase package might be acceptable to President Reagan. &quot;The answer is no,&quot; Mr. Baker said. &quot;Absolutely, completely, unalterably and unconditionally, the answer is no.&quot;    Investor Sentiment   Despite the way the market has bruised investors' go-go psychology, there's some evidence the recent slide hasn't completely eroded the optimism that by mid-August had pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average to more than triple its level five years earlier.    The securities house of Brean Murray, Foster Securities Inc. and its client, Blyth Holdings Inc., decided to hang tough during the market plunge and complete Blyth's initial public offering on Friday. The 1.1 million-share offering sold at $7 a share, and the stock finished the day in over-the-counter trading at $7.25 bid.    &quot;I think we deserve a Nobel Prize,&quot; says Brian R. Fernandez, Brean Murray's managing director.    Plenty of investors -- individuals and institutions -- also swam against Friday's tide, and some shrewd traders managed to avoid losses. Rather than turning away trades, Jack Thompson, the chief of over-the-counter trading at Asiel andamp; Co., a Wall Street securities firm founded in the 19th century, spent a harrowing day buying and selling the 60 OTC stocks in which the firm makes a market. All 60 of the stocks declined, he says, &quot;but I got out with a $1,700 profit.&quot;    Buy orders on Friday from individual-investor clients of Financial Network Investment Corp., of Torrance, Calif., topped sell orders by a two-to-one margin. &quot;Our clients are still buying,&quot; says Richard Goshert, a vice president.    Most individuals, it appears, neither bought nor sold on Friday. The action was dominated by the big block trades of institutions. Often that was more the result of their brokers' advice than their own initiative, however.    &quot;It seems like half our clients called in the past couple of weeks wondering if they should sell out,&quot; says a woman at Harry's Bar. The woman, who identifies herself only as &quot;Virginia,&quot; says she works with &quot;one of PaineWebber's biggest producers&quot; and that &quot;he's been telling them to hold. He thinks the market will go up again,&quot; she says. &quot;Out of 700 accounts, only one customer has sold out in the past two weeks,&quot; Virginia adds, but she says only two have bought more stock during that period.    Yet one expression of the earlier investor optimism -- relatively strong buying on margin, which means brokerage customers using borrowed money -- will be an increasingly bearish factor if the market slump continues.    For months, Robert Farrell, Merrill Lynch's top market watcher, has been warning in internal memos about aggressive buying by some of Merrill's margin-account customers during periods of market weakness. That's a sign of speculative excess, he believes, and he raises the prospect of forced liquidations through margin calls -- demands on customers to put more capital in these accounts -- in the days ahead.    While Merrill's margin-call experience last week and expectations this week weren't available, Donald Marron, chairman of PaineWebber, says margin calls at his firm have been modest and are expected to remain so. He says about 500 customers got margin calls last Thursday and another 500 on Friday. PaineWebber has about one million brokerage accounts, he said.    Mr. Marron adds that, with stock prices still 20% above their year-end 1986 level, margin calls shouldn't be a serious problem this week at most firms.    ---   Rose Gutfeld and Alan Murray in Washington and Earl C.
