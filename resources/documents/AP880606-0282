It was the second increase in the benchmark rate in less than aweek, and represents an aggressive move by the government to boostthe sagging pound and counter inflationary pressures.   Barclays Banks PLC, Midland Bank PLC, and Lloyds Bank PLC raisedtheir rate effective immediately. National Westminster Bank said itwould raise its rate effective Friday.   The Bank of England signaled the increase by raising a key moneymarket intervention rate of its own to 8.5 percent.   Last Thursday, the central bank signaled a rise in the base rateto 8 percent from 7.5 percent after the pound dropped sharply onforeign exchange markets. The increase was effective Friday.   The foreign exchange market reacted calmly to the latestincrease, dealers said, because a rate hike was widely anticipated.   ``It was going to happen sooner or later, and it happenedsooner,'' one dealer said.   Sterling rose to a session high $1.8060 just after the centralbank's move, but settled back to $1.8035, slightly up from $1.8020during the morning.   Corporate borrowers can obtain loans at 1 percentage point abovethe prevailing base rate.</TEXT></DOC>
