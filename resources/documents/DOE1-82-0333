(ii) Is the relative spacing between the (parallel) linesunique for a given relationship? Are the scales unique, or can they bemagnified relative to each other? Is there some relationship betweenspacing and scales for a given relationship between the variables? (iii)What is the necessary role of the 'tie line'? Can more tie lines be usedto produce more complex nomograms? (iv) Must the scales necessarily belogarithmic? What scales can possibly be used? (v) Given that there maybe many possible nomograms to express a particular relationship betweenvariables, how should the nomogram be chosen to minimise errors resultingfrom inaccurate drawing of the cross-lines? (vi) How can complicatedrelationships between variables, which cannot be expressed exactly bynomograms, be expressed approximately by nomograms? How can errors introducedby such approximations be minimised? In particular, concerning the lastquestion the authors have constructed a nomogram to express certain relationshipsbetween treatment parameters in a particular three-field technique forbreast cancer.</TEXT></DOC>
