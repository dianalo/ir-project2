WIELAARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Warsaw Pact has a massive numericalsuperiority over NATO in conventional arms on the ground and in theair, a NATO report said.   NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner said the report, issuedFriday, does not show a more defensive posture on Moscow's partdespite recent statements from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   ``I appeal to Mr. Gorbachev to match his words by deeds,''Woerner said. The report also aims to challenge Moscow to issue itsown data, he said.   The report, ``Conventional Forces in Europe: The Facts,'' doesnot touch on the quality of weapons, only their numbers. Woernersaid the numbers indicate Moscow has the potential to launch asurprise attack.   The study is not the basis for NATO negotiators at theConventional Stability Talks, expected to begin in Vienna early nextyear, he said.   ``These negotiations will have their own counting rules'' forconventional arms systems, that are more detailed and address notjust quantity of arms but also their relative quality, he said.   The report cites East bloc arms systems Western allies willlikely want reduced, including tanks and other armored vehicles,artillery, anti-tank weapons, air defense systems, helicopters _ aswell as overall troop strength.   The study says the Warsaw Pact nations have a large superiorityin 11 major arms systems and that in eight of these the Soviet Unionalone outguns all NATO nations and its Warsaw Pact allies combined.   The report cites these figures for individual arms systems forthe Warsaw Pact nations with comparable figures for NATO in brackets:   Main battle tanks, 51,500 (16,424); armored infantry fightingvehicles, 22,400 (4,153); other armored vehicles, 71,000 (35,351);artillery, 43,400 (13,857); anti-tank weapons, 44,200 (18,240); airdefense systems, 24,400 (10,109); helicopters, 3,700 (2,419)personnel, 3 million (2.2 million) and combat aircraft 8,250 (3,977).   Rozanne Ridgway, assistant secretary of state for Europeanaffairs, told a Washington news conference the report demonstratesthe Warsaw Pact has ``a substantial superiority'' in conventionalforces on the ground.   She cited the ``massive forward deployment of armored forces''organized and equipped for rapid and offensive operations.   Alton Keel, U.S. envoy to NATO, said the report shows East blocnations maintain forces bigger ``than those of NATO in all heavyweapons systems and that the Soviet Union retains forces all out ofproportion to those of any other European state.''   The NATO study focuses on ground and air forces, since navalforces will not be subject to the talks.   Keel said he expected the 16 NATO and seven Warsaw Pact nationsto begin the conventional arms talks ``very early next year'' in theAustrian capital.   The talks will cover the territory between the Atlantic Ocean andthe Ural Mountains.   They are to replace the Mutual and Balanced Force Reduction Talkson force levels in seven NATO and four Warsaw Pact nations incentral Europe which have remained fruitless after almost 15 years.   Steven Ledogar, the chief U.S. negotiator in Vienna, said Fridaythat preliminary meetings on the Conventional Stability Talks weredeadlocked over procedural concerns by France. A new meeting will beheld next week.   At issue is how to link the talks to the 35-nation Conference onSecurity and Cooperation in Europe, which comprises the NATO andWarsaw Pact nations and 12 neutral countries, officials said.   France wants to link the talks more firmly to the Conference onSecurity and Cooperation in Europe than the United States, whichwants the neutrals to stay away from East-West arms talks.</TEXT></DOC>
