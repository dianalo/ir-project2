Freedman (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> MO </CO><IN> TOB </IN><TEXT>   In its war against smoking restrictions, the tobacco industry has spent millions trying to galvanize its customers to speak out. Huge computer data bases, sophisticated phone and mail campaigns, glossy publications -- they've all been employed in hopes of creating a grass-roots smokers' rights movement.    It hasn't worked. Although some 55 million Americans smoke -- one-third of the adult population -- there are only about six organizations, with some 10,000 members in all, dedicated to smokers' rights.    What's the problem?    Part of the answer is that many, if not most, smokers feel guilty about their habit and are loath to take a public stand for the right to keep it; in contrast to racial and sexual equality, or even old Coke, most smokers say it isn't a cause they want to fight for. Many also have ambivalent feelings about cigarette makers.    Moreover, some political organizers suggest the problem also may lie with the cigarette industry itself. In recent years, cigarette makers have tried to make smokers' rights a First Amendment issue. But some grass-roots organizers maintain that smokers, an increasingly blue-collar market, aren't likely to be swayed by lofty rhetoric about the Constitution.    &quot;The downscale, undereducated constituency tends to view people who hide behind civil liberties and the First Amendment as bad people,&quot; says Roger Craver, president of Craver, Mathews, Smith andamp; Co., a political and direct-mail consulting firm. But Mr. Craver, a two-pack-a-day smoker, thinks the industry's problem is even more basic: &quot;The only way you can organize a true grass-roots movement is if there is sufficient passion,&quot; he says.    The tobacco companies, of course, must keep trying. Since the early 1980s, anti-smoking activists have won 350 strong local ordinances. New York City just last week adopted the stiffest policy in the nation.    &quot;We are at the very beginning of building a grass-roots network,&quot; insists Guy L. Smith, vice president of corporate affairs at Philip Morris. &quot;We want to get to the point where courtesy and common sense will prevail without the imposition of government into people's lives.&quot;    Philip Morris reaches out to smokers in its soft-sell, general-interest Philip Morris Magazine and in its hard-sell, issues-oriented Smoker newsletter. It keeps in close touch with potential activists through its vast data base containing the names of 10 million smokers -- including, among other things, their jobs and record of political activism. The company is forging close ties with the existing handful of smokers' rights organizations and plans shortly to give them direct financial support.    But Philip Morris and other tobacco companies have been hard pressed to successfully duplicate the look and feel of grass-roots intensity. For instance, when Northwest Airlines last month announced it would ban smoking on all its flights, it received several thousand Western Union letters denouncing its move. The trouble was, a large number of letters used the same phrases like &quot;cheap publicity stunt&quot; and &quot;marketing ploy.&quot; Northwest's reaction? It dismissed the communiques as &quot;orchestrated,&quot; coming from Philip Morris employees. (Philip Morris says the letters came from employees and from smokers it contacted by culling names from its data base.)    Even independent activists have trouble signing up able-bodied smokers. &quot;I have people say, 'If I want to smoke, I'll smoke come hell or high water,' but when it comes down to it, they don't want to defend it,&quot; says Billy Dee Johnson, president of Smokers in Indianapolis. Mr. Johnson has received 300 requests for his newsletter, but only 37 people have then agreed to pay the $12 annual dues to keep getting the newsletter.    Nor are smokers eager to defend the companies that make cigarettes. Holly Clark, a stage manager in New York, says she would never respond to a tobacco company's exhortation to speak out. &quot;That would be encouraging people to smoke -- a nasty habit,&quot; says the 25-year-old Marlboro smoker.    But the fact that smoking is unhealthy doesn't in itself explain why the smokers' rights movement is failing.    Some political experts, for instance, say that the tobacco industry has backed itself into a far corner. In contrast to the liquor industry, which trumpets the virtues of moderation, the tobacco industry has never publicly acknowledged its products have any risks. But most smokers know the risks only too well and feel a smoldering resentment about their addiction. So in trying to mobilize them, the industry has had to divert their attention from its product and the merits of smoking.    &quot;The industry can't argue that smoking has any socially redeeming value so it has to position the issue as rights being infringed and impinged upon,&quot; explains Michael Graham, vice president of Targeted Communications Inc., which specializes in grass-roots organizing.    The problem, though, is that most smokers don't seem to view smoking as a sacred, God-given right -- the tack that the National Rifle Association has taken, for instance. The NRA, with just three million members, has been enormously successful in blocking gun-control legislation. And that's because in addition to invoking the intellectual question of constitutional rights, the NRA has raised gun owners' passions with more emotional messages about patriotism, fear of crime, and the sanctity of the home.    &quot;It's hard to draw any parallel between losing your right to smoke in a restaurant and the fact that someone will come to your house, kick the door in, and take your gun away,&quot; says Mr. Graham.    Philip Morris's Mr. Smith counters &quot;the First Amendment plays well with anyone who believes in the American ethic.&quot;    And some smokers agree. Betty Tindle, for instance, recently joined the Mesa, Ariz.-based Smoker's Rights Alliance. The reason: Her cigarette habit cost her the opportunity to be hired at a San Diego company. &quot;Before that I never would have dreamed of going to fight,&quot; she says.    Tobacco companies predict more pushed-to-the-wall consumers will react that way. They contend they are barraged by customers pleading for information about how to counter discrimination. &quot;We are hearing from more and more smokers who are extremely angry and frustrated, so we have tried to respond,&quot; says Tom L. Ogburn, vice president of public issues at R.J. Reynolds Tobacco U.S.A., which late last year launched a publication called Choice and is now rolling out another called Regulatory Watch.    But the smokers' rights appeal isn't particularly well-suited to a smoking population that has become increasingly lower class. Many blue-collar workers, barred by tradition from smoking on the assembly line, aren't experiencing any new deprivation. After hours, the local bar is far less likely to segregate smokers than a trendy restaurant.    &quot;They aren't being denied anything that hasn't been a part of their way of life, so it just doesn't wash,&quot; says Joseph M. Rees, a partner at Francis, McGinnis andamp; Rees, a public-affairs outfit involved in grass-roots organizing. &quot;Upscale people understand the First Amendment argument better, but they also understand the right to smoke is not a right to threaten others.&quot;    Most agree that it's now too late for the tobacco industry to change its tune. But Mr. Craver, the political consultant, speculates the industry would have succeeded better if five years ago it had invoked class warfare. He says the industry could have portrayed the anti-smokers as a group of liberal elitists out to snatch away the small pleasures of the working man.    Says Mr. Craver: &quot;They should have painted the anti-smokers as a gaggle of do-gooders who lived in air-conditioned penthouses, ate brie, drank Chablis and were out of touch with ordinary Americans.&quot;    ---                      Smoking Statistics   Breakdown of U.S. population by cigarette-smoking status: Never smoked ................................. 45% Former smoker ................................ 24% Current smoker ............................... 31%   Source: National Center for Health Statistics   ---                        Behind a Ban   When people were asked last year whether they would favor a complete ban on smoking in all public places, they said: Favor ....................................... . 55% No opinion .................................... 2% Oppose ....................................... 43% Smokers: Favor ....................................... . 25% Oppose ....................................... 72% No opinion .................................... 3% Non-smokers: Favor ....................................... . 69% Oppose ....................................... 30% No opinion .................................... 1%</TEXT></DOC>
