He was 53.   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Yabutadied Friday of acute kidney failure at Kinki University Hospital inwestern Japan.   No liver or heart transplants have been performed in Japan since1968 because of controversy over the legal definition of death forpotential organ donors. Yabuta received the transplant atMassachusetts General Hospital in Boston on April 8, 1985, andreturned home seven months later.   In 1968, an 18-year-old boy underwent Japan's first hearttransplant but died 82 days later at Sapporo Medical College innorthern Japan.   The doctor who performed the operation was accused of obtainingthe heart from a brain-dead person. Traditionally, Japanese haveconsidered death to occur only after a person's heart stops beating.   The doctor was accused of murder in a citizen's complaint, butofficial murder charges were never filed.   Nevertheless, Japanese doctors halted heart and liver transplantsas a result of the controversy.   The hospital official refused to provide further details onYabuta's death, but Kyodo News Service said an autopsy showed noirregularities in Yabuta's transplanted liver or any symptoms ofrejection.   It said his death may have been caused by a decline in bodyresistance caused by medicine Yabuta took to prevent rejection ofthe liver.   Since Yabuta's transplant about 30 Japanese, mostly children,have received liver transplants in the United States, Europe andAustralia. Eight of them have died, Kyodo said.</TEXT></DOC>
