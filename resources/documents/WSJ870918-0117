BrauchliStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 09/18/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FREST EUROPAEROSPACE (ARO) </IN><DATELINE> STOCKHOLM  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A state prosecutor investigating allegations that the Swedish arms maker AB Bofors paid bribes to win a $1.3 billion artillery order from India said he will seek access to secret Swiss bank records.    Stockholm's chief prosecutor, Lars Ringberg, also said he thinks Bofors paid as much as 300 million Swedish kronor ($47 million) into Swiss bank accounts as part of the 1986 sale. It was the first time that Mr. Ringberg has specified the amount Bofors deposited into the accounts. Previously, findings by the country's National Audit Bureau had indicated that Bofors paid about $39 million.    In India, meanwhile, a court agreed to hear a petition demanding that two Bofors officials visiting New Delhi be required to surrender documents pertaining to the artillery order or face arrest. The opposition politician who filed the petition said the court should view the case as a criminal matter.    Mr. Ringberg's efforts to gain access to confidential Swiss banking records widens the scope of the investigation to encompass information about the recipients of the payments made by Bofors, a subsidiary of Nobel Industrier Sverige AB, a large chemicals and armaments group. &quot;To find out all we need to know, we must have help from the authorities,&quot; Mr. Ringberg said in a telephone interview.    Determining who received the money is crucial to proving a bribery case under Swedish law, which prohibits companies from paying fees to foreign officials to win contracts. Bofors has said that the money it paid constituted termination fees to agents who worked on the contract in India.    The issue also is politically crucial in India, where government officials have denied that they took bribes from Bofors. Opposition politicians in India have seized upon the Bofors case as evidence of corruption in the government of Rajiv Gandhi, whose Congress (I) Party has often campaigned on an anti-corruption platform. Some newspapers have called for Mr. Gandhi's resignation, and the scandal has prompted defections from Mr. Gandhi's cabinet.    Yesterday, P.K. Chandla, a New Delhi city council member from the Indian People's Party, filed a petition with the Delhi High Court demanding that the police be empowered to seize documents carried by Per Ove Morberg, president of Bofors, and Lars Gothlin, the company's chief counsel. They are in New Delhi to discuss the matter and were to appear before an investigating parliamentary committee.    The petition says that meetings between Indian and Bofors officials have no legal standing. &quot;No offender of our laws has ever sat across the table along with representatives of the government established by law to discuss terms according to which the offense shall be either investigated or not investigated,&quot; it said.    In Stockholm, a spokesman for Bofors said he had no information about the Indian petition. </TEXT></DOC>
