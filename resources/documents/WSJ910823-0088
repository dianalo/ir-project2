Boldrick's article (&quot;ABomber That Kills Missiles -- Ours,&quot; editorial page, July 16)that he is an expert on the MX missile. Unfortunately, he haslittle firsthand knowledge of congressional defense-budgetpolitics.   Col. Boldrick can rest assured that it was not competitionbetween important weapons such as the B-1 bomber and the MXmissile that limited our MX force to 50 in fixed silos.Likewise, it was not B-2 proponents that killed the MX-RailGarrison program. The blame belongs to the Democraticmajority in Congress.</LP><TEXT>   Congressional Democrats opposed adequate funding of the MXmissile throughout the 1980s, and they have consistentlyopposed the Rail Garrison proposal. They also opposed theB-1, the M-1 tank, the M-2 Bradley personnel carrier,strategic defenses and just about every high-technologydefense system that performed so well in the Persian Gulf.   While the Bush administration and the vast majority ofRepublican members of Congress support a defense budget thatinvests in our nation's future security, the liberalcongressional leadership views the defense budget as pork tobe carved up.   This competition between necessary military spending andCongress's pet projects is becoming more pronounced becauseof the drastic decline in our defense spending over the pastseven years. Since 1985, real defense spending has declined24%. As a percentage of gross national product, defensespending for fiscal 1992 has declined to 4.7%, a post-1950low. Defense Department spending is expected to declinethrough fiscal 1995, until the defense budget will havedeclined by 34% compared with 1985. By 1995, the U.S. will bespending less on defense as a percentage of GNP than we haveat any time since the bombing of Pearl Harbor.   For example, in the fiscal 1992 Defense AuthorizationBill, the House drastically cut the administration's requestfor the B-2 and the Strategic Defense Initiative's promisingBrilliant Pebbles technology. Both are vital systems thatwill maintain our technological edge in the decades to come.Money &quot;saved&quot; by cutting these projects was siphoned off topet projects such as more F-14 fighters (which the Navydoesn't want), more F-16 fighters (which the Air Force saysit doesn't need), and more engines for the Air Force tankerfleet (which the Pentagon already funds). This kind ofdefense spending wins congressional votes now, but it won'twin America's battles later.   The B-2 bomber is a revolutionary plane that will proveits value in both strategic and conventional roles. The B-2is the most affordable and effective way to maintain a viablebomber leg of the Strategic Triad in the next century. Justas the F-117 flew unaccompanied over Baghdad, the stealthyB-2 will not require an armada of fighters, radar jammers,tankers and ground-attack jets to carry out its mission. Inthe long run, the B-2 will save taxpayers literally billionsof dollars, not to mention lives.   A survivable ground-based missile leg of the Triad is alsovital to our national security. The consistent opposition ofthe Democratic majority in Congress to a mobile MX force isthe reason our missile force is increasingly vulnerable. Col.Boldrick's argument is with those who have opposed everydefense-modernization program of the past two decades -- theDemocratic majority in Congress -- not those who support theB-2 bomber.   Bob McEwen (R., Ohio)   U.S. House of Representatives   Washington   ---   Mr. Boldrick's assertion that the Peacekeeper RailGarrison program was killed because the money destined forthat program was somehow diverted to the B-2 bomber is simplywrong. Peacekeeper Rail Garrison was not killed by the B-2,but rather by the collapse of the fragile coalition onCapitol Hill that permitted both the small ICBM andPeacekeeper Rail Garrison to co-exist. Congress has indicatedthat we can't afford two intercontinental ballistic missilesin different mobile-basing modes, and has opted to fund thecontinuing development of the small ICBM over a Rail GarrisonPeacekeeper system. Essentially, the legislative coalitionthat at one time championed the need for two mobile missilesystems has simply evaporated.   Based on the recent Hill markups, there appears to be avery pronounced tilt in Congress toward banning mobilemissiles with multiple warheads in future armscontrolagreements. Although a ban is not ensured, there is areluctance now to spend the $6 billion cost to remove the 50Peacekeeper missiles from their silos and base them aboardspecially built trains.   Contrary to Mr. Boldrick's claim, the B-2 is fundamentalto the continued viability of our Triad. At a time when ournuclear arms control objectives are properly focused on amore stable strategic environment, recallable, slow-flyingbombers with no first-strike capability are at a premium.Without the B-2, the capability of our aging bomber forcewill continue to erode.   On the other hand, with the B-2, our margin of safety willbe preserved for decades -- and not just at night] The B-2 isan &quot;all-weather, all-hour&quot; bomber, designed as a multi-roleaircraft for both nuclear and conventional missions, unlikethe Peacekeeper, Minuteman, Trident D-5 and the smallballistic missiles.   In sum, in an era of much smaller military forces withdiminished access to overseas bases, we must leverage ourprecious national resources in the most cost-effective,militarily efficient fashion possible. The B-2 offersrevolutionary advantages to this nation for decades to come-- advantages enjoyed by no other nation. It will providethat vital margin of safety and that is why the U.S. AirForce has made the B-2 its No. 1 modernization priority.   Maj. Gen. Stephen F.
