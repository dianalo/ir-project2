The review coverstwo manufacturers and their exporters of this merchandise to the UnitedStates, and the period November 1, 1985 through October 31, 1986. The reviewindicates the existence of no dumping margins for one manufacturer/exportercombination and <T3>de minimis</T3> dumping margins for the second manufacturer/exportercombination during the period.As a result of the review, the Department has preliminarily determinedto assess dumping duties equal to the calculated differences between UnitedStates price and foreign market value.Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>July 11, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Anne D'Alauro or Maureen Flannery,Office of Compliance, International Trade Administration, U.S. Departmentof Commerce, Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202) 377-2923.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>On February 17, 1987, the Department of Commerce (``the Department'') publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (52 FR 4797) the final results of its last administrativereview of the antidumping duty order on titanium sponge from Japan (49FR 47053, November 30, 1984). Two respondents, Toho Titanium Co., Ltd.and Osaka Titanium Co., Ltd., and the petitioner, RMI Corporation, requestedin accordance with andSection; 353.53a(a) of the Commerce Regulations thatwe conduct an administrative review. We published a notice of initiationof the antidumping duty administrative review on December 18, 1986 (51FR 45364). The Department has now conducted that administrative reviewin accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (``the TariffAct'').On May 28, 1987, the Department received a request for revocation of theantidumping duty order from Osaka Titanium.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of the Review</ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of Customs nonmenclature. Congressis considering legislation to convert the United States to this HarmonizedSystem (``HS''). In view of this, we will be providing both the appropriate<T3>Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated</T3> (``TSUSA'') itemnumbers and the appropriate HS item number with our product descriptionson a test basis, pending Congressional approval. As with the TSUSA, theHS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes. Thewritten description remains dispositive.We are requesting petitioners to include the appropriate HS item number(s)as well as the TSUSA item number(s) in all new petitions filed with theDepartment. A reference copy of the proposed Harmonized System scheduleis available for consultation at the Central Records Unit, Room B-099,U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW.,Washington, DC 20230. Additionally, all Customs offices have referencecopies, and petitioners may contact the Import Specialist at their localCustoms office to consult the schedule.Imports covered by the review are shipments of unwrought titanium sponge.Titanium sponge is a porous, brittle metal which has a high strength-to-weightratio and is highly ductile. It is an intermediate product used to producetitanium ingots, slabs, billets, plates and sheets. Titanium sponge iscurrently classifiable under item 629.1420 of the TSUSA and under itemnumber 8180.10.50 of the Harmonized System.The review covers two manufacturers and their exporters of Japanese titaniumsponge to the United States, and the period November 1, 1985 through October31, 1986.<ITAG tagnum="84">United States Price</ITAG>In calculating United States price the Department used purchase price orexporter's sale price (``ESP''), as defined in section 772 of the TariffAct, as appropriate.For sales which were made through a related sales agent in the United Statesto an unrelated purchaser prior to the date of importation, we used purchaseprice as the basis for determining United States price when the followingcriteria were met:1. The merchandise in question was shipped directly from the manufacturerto the unrelated buyer, without being introduced into the inventory ofthe related selling agent;2. This was the customary commercial channel for sales of this merchandisebetween the parties involved; and3. The related selling agent located in the United States acted only asa processor of sales-related documentation and a communication link withthe unrelated U.S. buyer.Where all the above elements are met, we regard the routine selling functionof the exporter as having been merely relocated geographically from thecountry of exportation to the United States, where the sales agent performsthem. Whether these functions are done in the United States or abroad doesnot change the substance of the transactions or the functions themselves.We used ESP as the basis of U.S. price in instances where the merchandiseis ordinarily diverted into inventory by the related U.S. selling agent.The Department regards this factor as an important distinction becauseit is associated with a materially different type of selling activity thanthe mere facilitation of a transaction such as occurs on a direct shipmentto an unrelated U.S. purchaser. In situations where the related party placesthe merchandise into inventory, he commonly incurs substantial storageand financial carrying costs and has added flexibility in his marketing.We also use the inventory test because it can be readily understood andapplied by respondents who must respond to the Department's questionnairesin a short period of time. It is objective in nature, as the final destinationof the goods can be established from normal commercial documents associatedwith the sale and verified with certainty.Shipments by Toho to the U.S. during the review period were made pursuantto a long-term contract that predates the review period. Toho contendsthat, for purposes of comparison to foreign market value as of the dateof the U.S. sale, the contract date should be used as date of sale forthose shipments. RMI maintains that the dates of sale should be the shipmentdates or, at the earliest, the date of the delivery instructions. RMI reasonsthat the contract is only an options contract, i.e., an open offer by Toho,accepted by the buyer upon scheduling shipment. In order to resolve dateof sale issues, the Department is guided primarily by the date when theessential terms of the sale are established, quantity and price in particular,such that the parties have nothing left to negotiate. In this instance,the essential terms were set when the parties entered into the contract.Toho was committed to a price, as well as a total volume, at the contractdate. We have evaluated the arguments that the contract constitutes anoption and have preliminarily determined that it does not. In addition,since the parties performed in accordance with the contract, we preliminarilydetermine that the date of sale for these shipments is the contract date.Purchase price was based on the packed f.o.b. (U.S. port) or deliveredprice to unrelated purchasers in the United States. Exporter's sales pricewas based on the packed delivered price to the first unrelated purchaserin the United States.Where applicable, we made deductions for ocean freight, marine insurance,U.S. and foreign brokerage/handling fees, U.S. and foreign inland freight,foreign inland insurance, and U.S. customs duties. For exporter's salesprice, we made further adjustments for the parent's and U.S. subsidiary'sselling expenses. No other adjustments were claimed or allowed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Foreign Market Value</ITAG>In calculating foreign market value the Department used home market price,as defined in section 773 of the Tariff Act, since there were sufficienthome market sales of such or similar merchandise at or above the cost ofproduction to provide a basis for comparison.Home market price was based on the delivered packed price with adjustments,where applicable, for inland freight and insurance, rebates, post-salewarehousing, credit, and differences in the cost of packing. We made furtheradjustments, where applicable, for indirect selling expenses to offsetU.S. commissions and, in the case where U.S. price was exporter's salesprice, for U.S. indirect selling expenses.<ITAG tagnum="84">Revocation</ITAG>The Department has decided not to grant Osaka Titanium a tentative revocationdue to inadequate evidence that dumping is unlikely to be resumed. Contributingfactors in reaching this decision are Osaka's large surplus titanium spongeinventories, the decline in purchasing power of the dollar against theyen, and the minimal pricing differential currently existing between theU.S. and domestic markets.<ITAG tagnum="84">Preliminary Results of the Review</ITAG>As a result of our comparison of United States price to foreign marketvalue, we preliminarily determine that the following margins exist forthe period November 1, 1985 through October 31, 1986:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,8</C> <H1>Manufacturer/exporter</H1><H1>Margin (percent)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Toho Titanium/Mitsui<D>.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Osaka Titanium/Sumitomo<D>.03</D></ITAG></ITAG>Interested parties may request disclosure and/or an administrative protectiveorder within 5 days of the date of publication of this notice and may requesta hearing within 8 days of publication. Any hearing, if requested, willbe held 35 days after the date of publication, or the first workday thereafter.Pre-hearing briefs and/or written comments from interested parties maybe submitted not later than 25 days after the date of publication. Rebuttalbriefs and rebuttals to written comments, limited to issues raised in thosecomments, may be filed not later than 32 days after the date of publication.The Department will publish the final results of the administrative reviewincluding the results of its analysis of any such comments or hearing.The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumpingduties on all appropriate entries. Individual differences between UnitedStates price and foreign market value may vary from the percentages statedabove. The Department will issue appraisement instructions directly tothe Customs Service.Further, as provided for by 19 CFR 353.48(b), because no dumping marginexists for Toho Titanium/Mitsui and the margin for Osaka Titanium/Sumitomois less than 0.5 percent and, therefore, <T3>de minimis </T3>for cash deposit purposes, the Department shall notrequire a cash deposit of antidumping duties for these firms. For any shipmentsfrom Nippon Soda, the cash deposit will continue to be at the rate publishedin the antidumping duty order for this firm (49 FR 47053, November 30,1984). For any future entries of this merchandise from a new exporter,not covered in this or prior reviews, whose first shipments occurred afterOctober 31, 1986 and who is unrelated to any reviewed firm, no cash depositshall be required. These deposit requirements and waivers are effectivefor all shipments of Japanese titanium sponge entered, or withdrawn fromwarehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of the finalresults of this administrative review.This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1)of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and andSection; 353.53a of the CommerceRegulations (19 CFR 353.53a).<ITAG tagnum="6">Jan W.
