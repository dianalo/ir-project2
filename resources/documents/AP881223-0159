Richard Young Moon, a physician, sat near U.S. Navy diver RobertStethem, who was beaten and killed during the hijacking.   Hamadi is charged with murder and air piracy in the June 1985commandeering of TWA Flight 847 to Beirut, in which 39 Americanswere held hostage 17 days. He admits being one of the hijackers, butdenies killing Stethem.   Chief Judge Heiner Mueckenberger said Moon would be asked totestify when the trial resumes Jan. 17 after a holiday recess.   According to court records, Moon sat near Stethem after the diverwas beaten and before he was killed. Stethem was shot behind aclosed curtain and no one has testified to seeing who killed him.   More than two dozen American passengers and crew have testifiedsince the trial began nearly six months ago, describing how Hamadiand the other hijacker, identifed in court records as HassanEzzeddine, beat Stethem and other passengers.   Also at Friday's session, Mueckenberger discussed a defensemotion made Dec. 13 that President Hafez Assad of Syria and NabihBerri, leader of the Shiite Moslem militia Amal in Lebanon, be askedto testify.   Gabriele Steck-Bromme, a defense lawyer, said at the time shewanted Assad and Berri to be questioned about what she called apledge by U.S. authorities not to prosecute the hijackers if the TWAairplane hostages were released.   Berri was instrumental in negotiating the release and thehostages were taken to Damascus, capital of Syria.   Mueckenberger said Friday he did not feel testimony by Assad orBerri had ``any meaning'' in the case and doubted either would comeif asked.   U.S. officials denied when the hostages were released that anydeal had been made.</TEXT></DOC>
