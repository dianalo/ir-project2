KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The House voted today to urge President Bushto open negotiations with the Soviet Union aimed at banning theproduction of plutonium and enriched uranium, the materials used innuclear weapons.   The vote for the non-binding resolution, attached to a defenseauthorization bill, was 284-138.   Supporters of the amendment said such negotiations are a logicaland needed next step in the arms control process.   But opponents said such a ban would be impossible to verify andwould put the United States at a serious disadvantage because ithas no currently operating nuclear enrichment production plantswhile the Soviet Union has 12 to 14 ``going at full blast.''   Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., chairman of the House ForeignAffairs Committee, said the talks could resolve an ``tremendousimbalance'' in which the Soviets are adding to their nuclearstockpile while U.S. production stands at ``zero.''   ``This is an effort to get us on the negotiating track and dealwith this problem if possible,'' he said. ``This is an expressionof Congress saying, `Mr President, see what you can do.'''   Rep. Bob Walker, R-Pa., replied that the Bush administrationopposes the measure and that U.S. arms negotiators are against itbecause an agreement could not be verified.   ``Let's not do something stupid,'' Walker said.   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed ServicesCommittee, said he worried that Congress might, with suchsuggestions, ``overload the arms control agenda.''   Working through the defense bill, the House was expected totackle later such thorny issues as the F-14D Tomcat fighter planeand possibly the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, two programsDefense Secretary Dick Cheney has proposed canceling as abudget-reduction step.   The House voted Wednesday to curb production of theradar-evading stealth bomber program, but Cheney expressed reliefthe chamber had not killed the $70 billion program outright.   Cheney said the White House hopes a House conference with theSenate to resolve differences in the two chambers' versions of the$295 billion defense authorization bill will remove the roadblocksand permit a fast start for production of the costly bomber.   ``They (the administration) have, in effect, a year torestructure the program, to prove through tests it's worthbuying,'' Aspin told reporters. ``It's the core of the argument. Wedon't know enough right now to make a decision.''   The Aspin amendment would require the Pentagon to meet rigidtest and performance standards before additional stealth bombersare purchased. It would limit to two the number of bombers to bepurchased over the next two fiscal years.   The administration suffered an unwanted budget cut Wednesdaywhen the House approved an amendment to reduce by $502 million the$1.1 billion earmarked for spare MX missiles and for a rail systemBush requested to make the MX a mobile system. The 224-197 votedoes not affect the nearly $800 million earmarked for the missilesthemselves.   The Senate, voting 98-1 on Tuesday, endorsed President Bush'stwo-year request for $4.7 billion for stealth production,conditioned on the aircraft meeting flight-test and radar-evasionstandards.   Before adopting the Aspin amendment the House defeated aproposal to eliminate the program outright.   The Osprey and the Tomcat were put on the House agenda afterlawmakers from Pennsylvania, New York and Texas expressed dismaywith their cancellation.   The V-22, a tilt-rotor aircraft that takes off like a helicopterbut can fly like a plane, is manufactured by Boeing Helicopter Co.,and Bell Helicopter Textron Inc., located in Pennsylvania and Texas.   The Pentagon had planned to spend $25.9 billion on 663 Ospreys,including $1.3 billion in fiscal 1990.   The Tomcat, manufactured by the Grumman Corp. on Long Islandalso had come under Cheney's ax.   But the House Armed Services Committee voted last month torestore $157 million for the Osprey in fiscal 1990 and about $230million for the Tomcat.</TEXT></DOC>
