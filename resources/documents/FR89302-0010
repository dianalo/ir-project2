Background</ITAG>On April 1, 1985, section 1137 of the Social Security Act (the Act) wasestablished with provisions aimed at ensuring that various Federally-fundedwelfare agencies, including the Aid to Families with Dependent Children,the Food Stamp and Medicaid programs, furnish benefits to only those individualswho are eligible for them. (Section 2651 of Pub. L. 98-369). Section 1137requires the agencies administering these programs to have an income andeligibility verification system (IEVS) for exchanging with each other informationthat may be of use in establishing or verifying eligibility or benefitamounts. The provision mandated that the agencies target the use of theinformation to the uses most likely to be productive in identifying andpreventing ineligibility and incorrect payments.On February 28, 1986, HCFA, the Food and Nutrition Service and the FamilySupport Administration published jointly a final rule (51 FR 7178) to implementthe IEVS for the Medicaid, Food Stamp and AFDC programs. The rule requiredagencies that administer these programs to review and compare all informationreceived against the case file to determine whether it affects the applicant'sor recipient's eligibility or benefits. The regulations also require theagency to initiate a case action, or make an entry in the case record thatno action is necessary, within 30 days of receipt of the infomation for80 percent of the determinations.The reasoning behind requiring use of all information was twofold:(1) The agencies are responsible for ensuring that all determinations arecorrect and we believed that by requiring the use of the largest numberof data items available we might reduce errors; and(2) We anticipated that under any circumstances an agency would excludean item of information that was obviously erroneous or useless in the eligibilitydetermination.HCFA's regulations on IEVS in general are found at 42 CFR Part 435, SubpartJ; andSection; 435.952 specifically concerns the use of data.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Legislation</ITAG>After the three agencies jointly published the final rules, the BudgetCommittee of the House of Representatives in its report accompanying H.R.5300 (which was the basis for the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1986) notedthat the agencies' current rules do not permit targeting in the mannerit said it intended to allow in the original statute (H.R. Rep. No. 727,99th Cong., 2d. Sess. 424-425 (1986)). According to this 1986 report, itwas the original intent of the House Budget Committee to have States utilizea variety of information sources to verify the eligibility of applicantsand recipients of benefit programs, as an effective and efficient toolin preventing benefit payments from being made to individuals who are noteligible. The report states that the Committee believed that for the useof such information to be productive, States must be afforded the discretionto target their efforts in ways they determine most cost-effective. Torequire a follow up in all cases where any income is indicated ``was notwhat was intended by Congress and would result in an unnecessary and costlyadministrative burden on the States''. (H.R. Rep. No. 727, 99th Cong.,2d Sess. 424 (1986)).To ensure that the required matches are cost-effective verification processes,the Committee indicated that the States should be allowed to arrange thefollow up of case records based on match findings in order of importance.For example, following up on individuals whose unearned income exceedscertain tolerance levels is more efficient than verifying every case withunearned income.In addition, the Committee stated its belief that requiring States to actupon the information they receive within 30 days, as prescribed in thefinal rule, is unrealistic. ``States have a finite amount of administrativeresources, and are dependent upon the actions of others outside the agencyas well as the mail system to carry out their duties. For this reason,the Committee believes a 45-day requirement is more reasonable than the30 days set forth in the final rule. The allowance that action can be delayedfurther on up to 20 percent of the information items when collateral verificationsources are required_as provided in the final rules_should be retained.''(H.R. Rep. No. 727, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 425 (1986)).In section 9101 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (Pub.L. 99-509), Congress amended section 1137 (a) (4) of the Act to prohibitthe Secretary from requiring States to use the information they receivebecause of the IEVS to verify the eligibility of all recipients. The HouseBudget Committee's directive to allow the public assistance agencies 45days to act upon information received was not included as a legislativeamendment, however.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Revisions to the Regulations</ITAG>In order to bring the regulations into conformity with the amendment tosection 1137 of the Act made by Pub. L. 99-509, and to follow clearly expressedcongressional intent on the time period for acting upon information received,we are amending our regulations at 42 CFR Part 435, Subpart J.<T3>1. Targeting the Use of Information</T3>We are adding a new andSection; 435.953 to reflect existing law (section1137(a)(4) of the Act) to provide that all information received throughthe IEVS on recipients need not be used but that its use may be targeted.The revised regulations reflect amendments to section 1137(a)(4) of theAct, which permit each State agency to review and compare against the casefile (follow up) all information items or to target, for each data source,those information items that are likely to be productive in identifyingand preventing ineligibility and incorrect payments.Any agency that intends to exclude items from follow-up must submit a follow-upplan that specifies the categories to be excluded and provides a descriptionof the criteria defining each category. For each category, the agency mustprovide a reasonable justification explaining why the follow-up would notbe cost-effective. A formal cost-benefit analysis is not required. An agencymay find it preferable to base its justifications on the general experienceof its program in following up on specific categories of information.<ITAG tagnum="81">Restriction to recipients</ITAG>Under our current rules at 42 CFR andSection; 435.948, State agencies wererequired to use all information concerning both applicants and recipients.In providing that State agencies are allowed to target information, theamendment to section 1137(a)(4) of the Act refers to ``recipients'' only.Our current regulations requiring the use of information on all applicantsand recipients have thus been superseded with respect to recipients only.Therefore, we are revising the regulations to permit targeting to be usedonly for recipients. When the agency receives information on applicantswhom it has not yet determined eligible, the match data continues to be,as under existing regulations, not subject to targeting.We carefully considered proposing to revise our existing regulations topermit targeting of applicants, but we have decided at this time simplyto revise the regulations to bring the text into conformity with the newstatutory language that already legally governs targeting in the case ofrecipients. We believe it is not in the best interest of the program torevise the existing requirement that information on all applicants be used.The application period is particularly important in that the State agencyconducts an intensive review of all of the factors of the applicant's eligibility,including the economic circumstances of the household. Following an initialeligibility determination, periodic redeterminations of recipients tendto be somewhat less intensive with questions concentrating on whether achange in circumstances has occurred in the past few months or is expectedto occur in the next few months. Moreover, redeterminations may be conductedby telephone or mail or in group interviews. The application process istherefore more crucial to the integrity of the program and all informationitems must be pursued and resolved to the extent possible before authorizationof assistance. However, as currently required by andSection; 435.911, Stateagencies may not delay a pending application solely to await IEVS informationif other evidence establishes the individual's eligibility for assistance.Information the agency requests on an applicant that it receives afterit authorizes assistance is considered to be information received on arecipient and may therefore be targeted under section 1137(a)(4) of theAct and under these regulations.These regulation revisions do not affect the requirement that State agenciesrequest information on all recipients from the required sources but merelyconcern targeting the use of data received in response to the request.These changes, as do the current regulations, apply only in those situationsfor which the Medicaid agency makes the eligibility determination. ForMedicaid recipients eligible because they receive AFDC assistance, theAFDC IEVS requirements already apply. For aged, blind or disabled Medicaidrecipients receiving SSI payments, the Medicaid IEVS requirements applyonly if such recipients' Medicaid eligibility is not determined by theSocial Security Administration (SSA) pursuant to section 1634 of the SocialSecurity Act (see andSection; 435.909).2. Timeframe for Action on Match ResultsThese regulations also provide in andSection; 435.952 a 45-day period forfollowing up on information items, instead of the current 30 days; thispolicy would implement the directive contained in the report of the HouseBudget Committee. This is a maximum time period and does not preclude aState agency from setting shorter timeframes for acting on informationitems from a particular data base. For example, information items showingunreported UIB might be given priority over other information and be lookedat immediately.The provision that allows a 20 percent allowance for action on informationitems in which third party information is late remains the same as statedin andSection; 435.952(e) and applies also to targeted data since targetingwill not have any effect on the responsiveness of third parties.3. Quality Control RequirementsThe current rule at andSection; 435.952 clearly states that the requirementsof this section do not relieve the agency of its responsibility for determinationsof erroneous payments or the agency's liability for those erroneous payments.In order to clarify that the agency is liable even for items not followedup, we are amending andSection; 435.945. General requirements, by addingparagraph (h) to require the State agencies to retain records of all theinformation items received, including those not followed up. The agencywill, as now, have to retain information in a manner that assures thatit does not compromise information safeguards; the agency must make thisinformation available to quality control reviewers upon request.4. Third Party LiabilityTargeting does not apply to activities for establishing third party liabilitybenefit amounts. Section 1902(a)(25) of the Act requires that State agenciesor local Medicaid agencies take all reasonable measures to ascertain thelegal liability of third parties to pay for care and services providedto Medicaid recipients. Every employment lead, no matter how small, couldpotentially be a lead for health insurance.5. Technical ChangesWe are making three technical changes to andSection; 435.952. In paragraph(a), by cross reference, we incorporate the change that permits State agenciesto limit review and comparison of information to targeted information.In paragraph (c) we reflect the correct order the State agency must followwhen processing a recipient's case file under IEVS. Finally, in paragraph(e), we extend to 45 days the timeframe that a State agency may delay actionfor up to 20 percent of items and limit the items to those on which itrequested verification timely, instead of all items of information received.We are also changing andSection; 433.138(g)(1)(i). We are revising the timeframefor followup for TPL purposes from 30 to 45 days to make it consistentwith the timeframe for IEVS followup. We are retaining the provision fordelayed action beyond 45 days in 20 percent of the information items whenthe agency does not receive requested verification.<ITAG tagnum="84">D. Impact Analysis</ITAG>1. Executive Order 12291Executive Order 12291 (E.O. 12291) requires us to prepare and publish aregulatory impact analysis for any final rule that meets one of the E.O.criteria for a ``major rule''; that is, that would be likely to resultin: An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; a major increasein costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State,or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or, significant adverseeffects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets.We expect that the net effect of the targeting requirement reflected inthese regulations will be to reduce State agency costs since they willnot have to follow up on all data. State agencies will be able to targettheir follow up activities on matched data that, for example, exceed certaintolerance levels because it would not be cost-effective to follow up onmatched data below those levels. The extension from 30 to 45 days of thetime permitted for follow up also will reduce the pressure placed on Stateadministrative resources. For these reasons, we have determined that nothreshold criteria under E.O. 12291 are met. Therefore, a regulatory impactanalysis is not required.2. Regulatory Flexibility ActWe generally prepare a final regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistentwith the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unlessthe Secretary certifies that a final rule would not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposesof the RFA, State agencies are not small entities. We have determined,and the Secretary certifies, that this final rule does not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. We have thereforenot prepared a regulatory flexibility analysis.<ITAG tagnum="84">E. Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>Sections 435.945 and 435.953 of this rule contain information collectionrequirements that are subject to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. State agencies must beable to document that they received information for data matches from allsources for quality control purposes and, if they do not intend to followup on a category or categories of information, they must submit a planto the Secretary justifying the exclusion as cost-effective. The reportingburden for the information collections in andSection; 435.945 is estimatedto be 432 hours annually for a maximum of 54 States and jurisdictions.The reporting burden for the information collections in andSection; 435.953is estimated to be 40 hours per response for a maximum of 54 States andjurisdictions for a one-time total estimated burden of 2,160 hours. (Weare assuming a one-time response from all States and jurisdictions forthis estimate with no revised follow-up plans. However, some States andjurisdictions may submit no plan; others may revise theirs frequently.)A notice will be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> when the OMB approval is obtained. Organizationsand individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collectionrequirements should follow the directions in the address section within30 days after publication of this rule.Section 435.952 of this rule also contains information collection requirementsthat are subject to the OMB review. These requirements were approved bythat Office on April 11, 1986 in accordance with the Paperwork ReductionAct. The approval number is 0938-0467 and the approval expires April 30,1989. HCFA is requesting an extension of this approval for an additional3 years.<ITAG tagnum="84">F. Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking</ITAG>Generally, we publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> and afford public comment before issuing a finalrule. However, if adherence, to these procedures would be impracticable,unnecessary or contrary to the public interest, we may waive the procedures.This interim final rule with comment period simply revises the text ofexisting regulations to bring them into conformity with statutory requirementsand clearly expressed congressional intent without interpretation. Withrespect to the provisions permitting targeting of information on recipients,the revisions in these regulations have no substantive effect, as section1137(a)(4) already requires that such targeting be permitted, even thoughthe text of the existing regulations provides otherwise.Therefore, the Secretary finds good cause that issuing a notice of proposedrulemaking before these final rules is unnecessary and contrary to thepublic interest.<ITAG tagnum="84">G. Response to Comments</ITAG>Because of the large number of items of correspondence we normally receiveon rules requesting public comment, we are not able to acknowledge or respondto them individually.However, we will consider all comments that we receive by the date andtime specified in the <T2>``DATE'' </T2>section of this preamble, and, if we revise this finalrule, we will respond to the comments in the preamble of that revised rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">H.
