WIELAARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   NATO defense ministers Thursday vowedto upgrade short-range nuclear arms following the accord to banintermediate-range missiles and an earlier decision to remove 1,400nuclear warheads from Europe.   In related comments, Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci called amove in Denmark to firm up the country's anti-nuclear stance a``fundamental challenge'' to NATO's defense strategy.   Washington will not end its ``very firm policy'' of notconfirming or denying its warships carry nuclear arms, he said.   ``We cannot have that policy whittled away at in any way, shapeor form,'' Carlucci said.   The Danish parliament adopted a motion April 14 demandingwarships be reminded not to carry nuclear arms each time they visita Danish port. Denmark's minority center-right government hascalled for early elections over the issue.   British Defense Secretary George Younger said Britain, too, willnever say if its navy ships are nuclear-armed or not.   He and Carlucci spoke after a two-day meeting at which thedefense ministers agreed to continue to seek improvements in NATO'snuclear arms in Europe.   NATO is studying how to upgrade short-range nuclear arms after a1983 decision to remove 1,400 nuclear warheads from Europe and theIntermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty to remove ground-launched,medium-range missiles.   The agreement was signed Dec. 8 by President Reagan and Sovietleader Mikhail Gorbachev.   Some tactical arms are now being modernized, including artilleryshells and jets carrying both nuclear and conventional arms,Carlucci said.   On introducing by the mid-1990s new ground-to-ground andair-to-ground missiles, he said, ``There are no particulardeployment decisions that need to be addressed at this point.''   But NATO will ``proceed at a measured pace'' to improve itsnuclear arms in Europe, Carlucci added.   In a communique, the defense ministers said,   ``For the forseeable future nuclear forces will continue to playan integral role in providing for deterrence ... their presence inEurope is therefore essential.''   It added NATO will keep these arms ``up-to-date wherenecessary.''   Carlucci briefed the allies on intelligence reports that Moscowcontinues to upgrade or redeploy nuclear arms not covered by theINF treaty.   Sources said Moscow has deployed more than 4,000 tacticalaircraft, 25 to 30 percent of which are nuclear-armed. Also, it isretargeting missiles such as the long-range SS-24s and SS-25s,officials said.   The Soviets, Younger said, were ``undoubtedly busy keeping theirweapons systems up-to-date.''   The ministers called the INF treaty ``a milestone in our effortsto achieve a more secure peace at lower levels of arms.''   They restated their support for superpower efforts to halvetheir strategic nuclear forces. Hopes have faded that a STARTtreaty can be signed at the May 29-June 2 U.S.-Soviet summit inMoscow.   Carlucci said that given the progress in East-West arms controlnegotiations, the Danish parliament resolution to tighten up thecountry's anti-nuclear ban came ``at a particularly unfortunatepoint in time.''   NATO Secretary-General Lord Carrington said the motion ``wouldobviously lead to very great difficulties in the alliance'' ifimplemented.   Danish Defense Minister Bernt Johan Collet told the NATOministers that early elections had been called for May 10 to seek``a political mandate'' for continued, full NATO membership for hiscountry.   A poll published Thursday showed that most Danes want to have anuclear-free zone in Scandinavia, and nearly half would favor theidea even if it meant leaving NATO.</TEXT></DOC>
