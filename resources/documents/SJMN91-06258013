They enciphered theirTeletypes, stamping at least one &quot;classified,&quot; and shared what they learnedwith Army, Navy and Air Force intelligence.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  NERVOUS WHITE HOUSE TARGETED WOMEN'S LIBFBI SPIED ON FOES OF BEAUTY PAGEANT  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     The mission?;   Find out about this new breed of protesters -- these peoplewho called themselves &quot;women's liberation&quot; -- who were besieging one of thenation's most revered institutions: the Miss America Pageant.;   Thesurveillance, and the concern at the highest levels about the first feministdemonstration in recent times, was disclosed in FBI documents obtained by thePhiladelphia Inquirer through the Freedom of Information Act.;   LyndonJohnson's White House might have focused its attention there because thepageant supported the Vietnam War but the protesters were New Left andanti-war, said Robin Morgan, one of the organizers. Morgan, a poet, is noweditor in chief of Ms. magazine.;   The 43 pages of heavily censored recordsinclude a four-page Teletype to the White House on the day that Miss Illinois,Judith Anne Ford, 18, was crowned Miss America on a nationwide televisionshow. The report ends with a note stating: &quot;The above is being furnished atthe specific request of the White House.&quot;;   Morgan said in an interview thatshe and other women's liberation leaders presumed they were subjects of FBIsurveillance but had no idea it was conducted on orders from the White House.;  &quot;I obtained my own FBI file years ago,&quot; she said, &quot;and it showed our phoneshad been tapped because it recounted all these conversations I had when I wasnursing and about my child's development. It was hilarious. The FBI tried tofigure out if when I said 'three teeth' it was really about a new tooth comingin or some secret code. But I had no idea the White House was involved.&quot;;  Morgan said the boardwalk protest &quot;was the first by the modern wave of thewomen's liberation movement. Up until that time we had always done the typing,mimeographing and bail-raising while the men planned the protests. The menalways got the parade permits, but this time we did it all. I rememberborrowing a bullhorn. This was our foray into the adult world and we were allexcited bunnies.&quot;;   Three women were arrested, two for unfurling a banner inConvention Hall that read &quot;Women's Liberation.&quot; It was not seen on thetelevision show. The third woman was arrested &quot;for spraying an offensiveodor,&quot; an FBI Teletype stated. News reports identified the substance as ToniHair Spray, a pageant sponsor.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DAVID JOHNSTON, Knight-Ridder News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Atlantic City, N.J.  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910914  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  455  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday, September 14, 199100258013,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
