Applicant is a Delaware corporation and all of its shares of commonstock are owned by Corporate Trinity Company (``CTC''), a company controlledby The Corporate Trust Company (``CT''). There is, and in the future willbe, no class of equity securities of Applicant other than its common stock.SERI, an Arkansas corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Middle SouthUtilities, Inc., a Florida corporation and registered public utility holdingcompany (``MSU'').2. Applicant's sole purpose is to assist SERI in the financing and refinancing,in whole or in part, of its 90% undivided interest in Unit No. 1 (``Unit1'') of the Grand Gulf Nuclear Generating Station (``Grand Gulf''), certainfacilities common to Unit 1 and Unit 2 of Grand Gulf (``Common Facilities''),and capital improvements thereon in one or more leveraged lease transactions(``Lease Transactions'') in which SERI will be the lessee (the ``Lessee'').\1\<NOTE/> CTC and CT have entered into an agreement with SERI underwhich CTC and CT have agreed to cause Applicant to make loans to one ormore Lessors (as defined below) designated by SERI from time to time andSERI has agreed to provide certain indemnifications to CTC and CT withrespect to such participation. SERI will make the determination as to whetheror not the debt portion of any Lease Transaction will be funded throughthe Applicant's sale of its debt securities (the ``Lease Bonds''). Pursuantto an operating agreement and a joint construction, acquisition and ownershipagreement relating to Grand Gulf (the ``Project Agreements'') with SouthMississippi Electric Power Association (``SMEPA''), the owner of the remaining10% undivided ownership interest in Grand Gulf, SERI is authorized to actas agent for SMEPA with respect to, and has responsibility for and controlover, the construction, operation and maintenance of Grand Gulf. Rightsunder the Project Agreements relating to the undivided interests to befinanced by SERI in the Lease Transactions will be assigned to the Lessors(as defined below) and reassigned for the benefit of the holders of LessorNotes (as defined below).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\The SEC granted an order in Holding Company Act Rel. No.35-24791 (Dec. 23, 1988) permitting the sale and leaseback of approximately10-15% of SERI's interest in Unit 1 (``1988 Lease Transactions''), theproceeds of which were used to redeem certain of SERI's outstanding firstmortgage bonds. The 1988 Lease Transactions, subsequent Lease Transactions,and the Lease Bonds (as defined herein) relating to such transactions willbe conducted in compliance with the representations and conditions in thisapplication.3. Applicant's agreement to participate as lender in the Lease Transactions(``Participation Agreement'') will be limited to making loans pursuantto a Loan and Security Agreement or a Trust Indenture and Security Agreementwith a bank or trust company acting as trustee (in either case, a ``LeaseIndenture'' with a ``Lease Indenture Trustee'') to certain lessors (Lessors'')under leases (``Leases'') which will be payable primarily from rentalsand other payments by the Lessee under the Leases. The loans by Applicantwill be without recourse to the general credit of the Lessors or theirrespective beneficiaries (as defined below) and will be evidenced by non-recourseobligations of the respective Lessors (``Lessor Notes''). Applicant expectsthat the lessor Notes will be offered and sold under circumstances makingsuch transactions exempt from the registration requirements under the SecuritiesAct of 1933 (``Securities Act'').4. Under each Lease, the Lessor will be a bank or trust company incorporatedand doing business within the United States of America and having a combinedcapital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. The Lessor will act as ownertrustee under a grantor trust formed exclusively for the purpose of theLease Transactions.\2\<NOTE/> Solely to comply with applicable state law, an individualmay be appointed to serve as co-owner trustee under such trust agreement.\3\<NOTE/> A portion of the purchase price of the property owned bythe Lessors and leased to the Lessee (``Leased Property'') will be paidby the beneficiaries of the grantor trust and that amount will constitutetheir equity investment in the Leased Property. The beneficial interestsin the grantor trust will be offered and sold in private transactions tosophisticated investors. The nature and availability of tax benefits, thelegal and regulatory framework of the Lease Transactions, and the complexfinancial analysis required assure that only sophisticated institutionalinvestors will be holders of or potential transferees of the beneficialinterests. As long as the Lessor Notes issued by the Lessor are outstanding,the Applicant will receive assurances from each Lessor and the beneficiariesunder the related grantor trust that they are not and will not be an investmentcompany within the meaning of section 3(a) of the 1940 Act, or are or willbe deemed to be excluded from the definition of an investment company byvirtue of the provisions of section 3(b) or section 3(c) of the 1940 Act.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\The initial corporate co-owner trustee under the 1988 LeaseTransactions, Meridian Trust Company (``MTC''), does not have a combinedcapital and surplus of at least $50 million. However, MTC is an indirect,wholly-owned subsidiary of Meridian Bancorp, Inc. (``Meridian''), withtotal consolidated assets of over $8 billion, and Meridian has agreed unconditionallyto guarantee the performance of MTC's obligations.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\The role of such individual co-owner trustee would be minimaland consist primarily of taking title to all or part of the trust estatejointly with the corporate co-owner trustee and joining in the executionof the Transaction Documents (defined herein). The trust documents wouldnot empower the individual to take any action thereunder except jointlywith, or with the consent in writing of, the corporate co-owner trustee.5. Under each Lease, the Lessee (<T3>i.e., </T3>SERI) will be unconditionally obligated to make rental andother payments sufficient to pay the principal of, and premium, if any,and interest on, the Lessor Notes issued in connection therewith withoutright of counterclaim, setoff, deduction or defense.\4\<NOTE/> The documentation for the Lease Transactions (``TransactionDocuments,'' which include the Project and Participation Agreement) willrequire that each series of Lessor Notes pledged as security for any seriesof Lease Bonds contain provisions for redemption which correlate to theredemption provisions of such Lease Bonds. The Transaction Documents alsowill require that, so long as no event of default shall have occurred underany Lease, the related Lease Indenture Trustee shall not take or causeto be taken any action contrary to the Lessee's rights under such Lease,including the right to quiet use, enjoyment and possession of the LeasedProperty.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ As Lessee, SERI well be responsible for paying all taxes,insurance premiums, operating and maintenance costs, and all other similarcosts associated with the undivided interest in Unit 1.6. The Lease Indentures will set forth the terms and conditions under whichthe Lessor Notes will be issued. All Lessor Notes issued under each LeaseIndenture will be equally and ratably secured thereunder. Each Lease Indenturewill require the Lessor that is a party to such agreement to grant to theLease Indenture Trustee thereunder an assignment of basic rentals and certainother payments to be made by the Lessee under the applicable Lease (``LeaseIndenture Estate''). Applicant represents that it shall not purchase anyLessor Note unless such Lessor Note and all other Lessor Notes, if any,are issued in respect to Leased Property having a fair market sales value(measured at the time such Leased Property was first financed under theLease) at least equal to 110% of the original principal amount of suchLessor Note and such other Lessor Notes.7. All Lease Bonds will be issued under a common indenture and a separatesupplemental indenture for each series (collectively, the ``CollateralTrust Indenture'') which will establish the terms of the Lease Bonds ofthat series and will be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939(``Trust Indenture Act''). All series of Lease Bonds will be issued byApplicant under the Collateral Trust Indenture and will be secured thereunderon a parity basis by a first lien on, and a security interest in, all ofthe assets of Applicant, consisting primarily of the acquired Lessor Notesand a lien on and security interest in the Leased Property. Applicant willassign and pledge to the Trustee under the Colleteral Trust Indenture,as security for the payment of the principal of, and premium, if any, andinterest on, all Lease Bonds, the Lessor Notes and any other assets heldby the Applicant. The pledged Lessor Notes shall be registered in the nameof the Trustee. Each such Lessor Note, in turn, will be secured by, amongother things, (i) a security interest in substantially all the rights ofthe related Lessor under the related Lease, including the right of theLessor to receive basic rentals and certain other amounts payable by SERIthereunder, and (ii) the Leased Property under the related Lease. The trusteeunder the Collateral Trust Indenture (``Trustee'') will be a bank or trustcompany not affiliated with any of the Lessors and will not be a trusteeunder any indenture of MSU or SERI or any other of MSU's subsidiaries.8. The various series of Lease Bonds will have terms which may differ asto interest rates, sinking fund obligations of Applicant, the right ofApplicant to redeem such Lease Bonds, and other matters. The interest rates,maturities and principal amounts of each series of Lease Bonds will beestablished based on prevailing market conditions, thereby giving Applicantflexibility to take advantage of changing market conditions. If the cashflow to the Applicant from payments on the Lessor Notes exceeds the cashrequirements at any such time of Applicant's obligations under the LeaseBonds, the resulting funds (``Temporary Funds'') may be invested by Applicantin certain investments (``Permitted Investments'' as defined in condition6 below), in each case maturing at such time as shall be necessary to satisfyApplicant's obligations under the Lease Bonds (``Temporary Holdings'').The cash requirements at any given time of Applicant's obligations underthe Lease Bonds, however, shall never exceed the cash flow to Applicantfrom payments made on the Lessor Notes. The amounts due under the LessorNote will be the Lessor's share of Applicant's Cost of Money, as definedin the application, so that the amount of principal and interest payableunder the Lessor Notes will be adequate to discharge the interest or, principalof, and all other costs and expenses payable by the Applicant under, theLease Bonds.9. The initial issuance of Lease Bonds will be through an underwrittenpublic offering of one or more series having an aggregate principal amountof approximately $435 million. Although SERI will not be the actual issuerof the Lease Bonds, it will be considered the ``issuer'' under the SecuritiesAct and ``obligor'' under the Trust Indenture Act. Any registration statementfor the Lease Bonds filed under the Securities Act will name SERI as theregistrant and will be signed on behalf of SERI by such of its officersand directors as may be required under the Securities Act and the rulesand regulations of the SEC thereunder. Accordingly, the provisions of section11 of the Securities Act will apply to SERI. Subsequent Lease Bonds willbe issued in private placements pursuant to section 4(2) of, or in underwrittenpublic offerings registered under, the Securities Act, or possibly in distributionsexempt from registration because they will come to rest outside the UnitedStates, in which case, Applicant will adopt agreements and procedures reasonablydesigned to prevent such Lease Bonds from being offered or sold in theUnited States or to United States persons (except as United States counselmay then advise is permissible).10. Under the Collateral Trust Indenture, the Trustee will be requiredto give prompt notice to all holders of Lease Bonds when it has actualknowledge of the occurrence of any event of loss or deemed event of lossunder any Lease. Thereafter, each Lease Bondholder will have the rightto direct the Trustee, as the holder of the pledged Lessor Notes, to votethe principal amount of the pledged Lessor Notes in proportion to the principalamount of Lease Bonds owned by such holder to direct the Lease IndentureTrustees to take such action, or refrain from taking such action, as ispermitted under the Lease Indentures. Under each Lease Indenture, directionsgiven to the Lease Indenture Trustee will be dictated by the holders ofa majority in principal amount of all Lessor Notes issued thereunder, whichwill be the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of theoutstanding Lease Bonds. By virtue of this pass-through voting mechanism,the rights and remedies available under the provisions of the Lease Indenturesto Lessor Noteholders will be exercisable directly by the Lease Bondholdersthrough their fiduciary, the Trustee. To the extent the Trustee does notreceive instructions following an event of default under a Lease Indenture,it will take such action with respect to the Lessor Notes as a prudentman would in the case of his own property.11. In the event SERI defaults in the payment of that portion of rent necessaryto pay all amounts due and payable in respect of the Lessor Notes, theLease Indenture Trustee would have the right to exercise, concurrentlywith the exercise by the respective Lessor of any remedies available toit, all of the rights and remedies against SERI provided in the relatedLease. By virtue of the pass-through voting mechanism noted above, theexercise of such rights and remedies would be at the direction of the LeaseBondholders through the Trustee's instructions to the Lease Indenture Trustee.The rights and remedies would include the right to demand, after a specifiedgrace period, that the Lessee pay all unpaid basic rent plus a stipulatedamount which, in all cases, will be sufficient to pay the principal of,and premium, if any, and interest on, the related Lessor Notes. These amountswill be paid directly to the Trustee for distribution to the Lease Bondholders.Therefore, the Lease Bondholders will have access under the CollateralTrust Indenture and the Lease Indentures to the credit of SERI which willentitle the Lease Bondholders to realize on the collateral secured therebyin an amount up to the aggregate unpaid amount of such Lessor Notes. Incertain circumstances, SERI may assume the obligations of the Lessor Notesor purchase from the beneficiaries of the grantor trusts issuing the LessorNotes their interests in order to avoid an accelerated obligation to prepaythe Lessor Notes under the provisions of the Leases.12. In the event of refinancing or releveraging of interim bank indebtednessincurred by the Lessors to pay for the Leased Property, the Applicant'sparticipation will be subject to the conditions set forth in section I.A.11.of the application to assure proper documentation and a security interestfor repayment from the Lessors. Because of these conditions and SERI'sobligation to pay the costs and expenses of the refinancings, such refinancingswould be infrequent and would occur only where it is economically advantageousdue to lower market interest rates or tax benefits. Also, if such interimbank indebtedness is not refunded in full at the time of the issuance ofthe Lease Bonds, no bank would have any greater rights under the relatedLease Indenture than those available to the Lease Bondholders under therelated Collateral Trust Indenture.13. The Transaction Documents may provide that the issue, sale and deliveryof a particular series of Lease Bonds financing Leased Property may transpireup to two months prior to the date of the execution and delivery of theLeases (``Lease Closing Date''). Pending the Lease Closing Date, the Trusteemay invest the net proceeds of the Lease Bonds in Permitted Investments.However, the Collateral Trust Indenture will require that the Lease Bondsbe secured by (a) the proceeds of the sale of such Bonds, (b) TemporaryHoldings and Temporary Funds, if any, (c) Lessor Notes previously pledgedto the Trustee, and (d) an obligation of the Lessee that will expire onthe related Lease Closing Date and provide for the payment of amounts sufficientto pay such Bonds. If the Lease Closing Date does not occur two monthsafter the Lease Bonds are issued, then no later than three months thereafter,SERI must cause (and, if necessary, provide funds necessary for) the redemptionof such Lease Bonds.14. Except to the extent payable from the proceeds of refinancing LeaseBonds, the Temporary Holdings, or the initial issuance of Lease Bonds wherethe relevant Lease Closing Date does not occur simultaneously, due to thenonrecourse nature of the Lessor Notes and the limited scope of Applicant'sactivities, payment of the principal of, and premium, if any, and intereston, the Lease Bonds will be made exclusively from amounts paid by the Lesseeand, if an event of default has occurred under a Lease Indenture, fromthose proceeds obtained by the Lease Indenture Trustee upon its exerciseof remedies under such Lease Indenture.15. During any fiscal year of Applicant, the average daily balance of theTemporary Holdings plus the amount of Temporary Funds will not be permittedto exceed ten percent of the average daily balance of the aggregate principalamount of the outstanding Lease Bonds, except for the situation describedin paragraph 13 above.Applicant's Legal ConclusionsApplicant's requested exemption under section 6(c) of the 1940 Act is appropriatein the public interest and consistent with the protection of investorsand the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940Act for the following reasons. Applicant's activities are essentially thoseof a special purpose finance company. The proposed issuance of Lease Bondswould provide a financially favorable method for SERI to acquire the useof capital assets necessary to conduct its business since SERI would notbe confined to the terms offered by the institutional private placementmarket. Although the Lease obligations technically are not a guaranteeof the Lease Bonds, the unconditional obligations of SERI under the Leases,combined with the default and remedy provisions under the Lease Indenturesand the Collateral Trust Indenture and, in particular, the pass-throughvoting mechanism provided thereby, will cause the debt service on the LeaseBonds ultimately to constitute an obligation of SERI that is the functionalequivalent of a guaranty. Thus, the Lease Bondholders will have accessto SERI's credit. Furthermore, because of the pass-through voting mechanism,the Lease Bondholders will be able to direct the exercise of the rightsand remedies provided in the Lease Indentures and Collateral Trust Indentureagainst SERI.<ITAG tagnum="84">Applicant's Conditions </ITAG>If the requested order is granted, Applicant agrees to the following conditions:1. In the future, all outstanding shares of Applicant's common stock willbe owned by CTC or a successor to, or assignee of, CTC performing similarfunctions, and there will be no public offering of the common stock orof any other equity security of Applicant. 2.

Payments of the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on,the Lessor Notes issued to the Applicant will be due in such amounts andat such times as will be sufficient to pay the principal of, and premium,if any, and interest on, the Lease Bonds on the scheduled payment datestherefor, including sinking fund payment dates. The Lessee shall indemnifythe Applicant for all other costs and expenses payable by the Applicantin respect of the Lease Bonds. 5. SERI, in its capacity as Lessee under each Lease, will covenant that(a) it will not, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or permitto exist any lien or other encumbrance on or with respect to the LeasedProperty, the Lessor's title thereto, or any interest of the Lessor therein,except certain ``permitted liens'' listed in section I.C.6. of the application,and (b) it will promptly at its own expense take such action as may benecessary duly to discharge any such lien, except permitted liens. 6.
