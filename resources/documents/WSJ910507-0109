Fully 28.2% of U.S. households with telephones hadunlisted numbers as of last year, according to SurveySampling in Fairfield, Conn. The figure has jumped from 21.8%in 1984.   The most anonymous of the nation's 100 biggestmetropolitan areas is Los Angeles/Long Beach, with 59.9% ofhouseholds unlisted. Close behind is Las Vegas, Nev., with58.3%. The least privacy-minded is Syracuse, N.Y., with only12.2% unlisted.   But an unlisted number doesn't guarantee a life withoutthe annoyance of unsolicited calls. Survey Sampling, a bigsupplier of samples for phone surveys, uses data-basetechnology to ensure its samples include a proportionatenumber of unlisted phones. (Its research suggests phonesurveys aren't accurate unless they represent unlistednumbers.)   Survey Sampling buys an electronic data base ofwhite-pages listings nationwide, a product several firmsoffer. It analyzes the data to find all the five-digitcombinations with which listed phone numbers begin. Then itcomes up with phone numbers that begin with those five digitsbut aren't already listed. The firm reasons there's a goodchance someone will pick up on the other end.                                                                                                          Federal Computer Sale   Includes Sensitive Data                                                                                                          YOU don't have to be an ingenious hacker to break into asecret computer file. Sometimes you just have to buy theright computer.   Federal prosecutors in Lexington, Ky., learned this in anightmarish way last year when they sold 13 used computersfor $45 to a local dealer. After the sale, the prosecutorswere shocked to learn that the computers still containedsensitive information about protected witnesses, confidentialinformants and continuing cases.   Disclosure of the information would have &quot;immediate andirreparable consequences,&quot; the Justice Department said. Theprosecutors thought they had deleted the files with a magnet,but later said it must not have been powerful enough.   The department scrambled to recover the computers, andtoday says the episode ultimately didn't hurt any cases orpeople.   But last month, the General Accounting Office issued aharsh report calling the Kentucky incident part of a&quot;systemic&quot; pattern of &quot;neglect and inattention&quot; that couldendanger agents and witnesses across the nation. The office,Congress's investigative arm, said computer securitythroughout the Justice Department is so &quot;appalling&quot; itcouldn't describe all the details publicly.   In response, Justice officials say they have ordered newsecurity training and audits at virtually all federalprosecutors' offices. The department also asked all itsoffices to check on all their recent sales of used computers.                                                                                                          IRS Appears to Break   Rules on Credit Checks                                                                                                          HERE'S A worrisome example of unauthorized access intocomputers that store consumers' private credit records. Theculprit: the Internal Revenue Service.   Many taxpayers don't know the IRS has routinely checkedcredit records for five years -- even as complaints mountthat the records are riddled with errors. IRS rules letemployees inspect full credit records of anyone owing backtaxes, and partial records of subjects of other IRSinquiries. Any other search requires an official IRS summons.   But a newly disclosed report by the IRS's chiefinspector's office suggests that the agency doesn't alwaysfollow its own credit-check rules -- or federal law. Thereport was obtained through the Freedom of Information Act byPrivacy Times, a Washington newsletter.   In examining a sample of 455 IRS credit checks, the reportfound that 21 appeared to break the rules because thetaxpayers weren't the subject of any IRS inquiry. The reportalso says a former IRS employee in Florida was convicted andsentenced to two years' probation for illegally tapping acredit bureau's data base.   The IRS says the 21 credit checks could have been promptedby extenuating circumstances. But the agency doesn't know whomade those checks and why, because it lacks sufficientreporting procedures, the report says. It says the IRS'schief counsel called upon the agency in 1986 to create suchprocedures. An IRS spokesman says the agency is adding newreporting rules.   Expanding computer networks allow the credit-reportingindustry to send files directly to any PC. Customers mustkeep to the limited purposes allowed by federal law. But thenew technology has stirred fears that it's getting too easyto see reports illegally.                                                                                                          Devising Mailing Lists   For Every Marketer                                                                                                          MAILING-LIST vendors are becoming more imaginative thanever about finding new ways to collect and sell names,addresses and phone numbers of unwitting consumers.   Jami Marketing Services, Pearl River, N.Y., advertises alist of 150,000 callers of a &quot;Love Lines Dating and Fantasy&quot;900 phone number, and caller lists for 12 other 900 numbers.   Qualified Lists, Armonk, N.Y., offers more than 10 millionnames of people with &quot;derogatory&quot; items listed on theircredit reports. It recommends the list for marketers ofsweepstakes, &quot;business opportunities&quot; and gold credit cards.Some direct marketers say people with credit problems arealso likely to be big spenders.</TEXT></DOC>
