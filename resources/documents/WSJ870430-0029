According to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Chesapeake Insurance Co., the Bermuda company, paid $3.5 million for the shares, representing about 12.2% of Sharon's common outstanding, in a private transaction completed on April 15. The move reduced NVF's Sharon holdings to 74% from about 86%.    It wasn't immediately clear whether the move was related to Sharon's bankruptcy-law filing, which was made April 17. The document Chesapeake filed with the SEC said the shares were purchased as an investment.    An NVF official said NVF decided the stock sale &quot;was appropriate because it provided it with additional working capital.&quot;    Sharon Steel filed for Chapter 11 protection in U.S. bankruptcy court in Erie, Pa., blaming a threat by a major debenture holder to force liquidation of the company. Under Chapter 11, a company continues to operate under court supervision while it works out a plan to pay its debts. </TEXT></DOC>
