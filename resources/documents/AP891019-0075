In Taif, Saudi Arabia, sources at the meeting of the Lebaneseparliament said the Saudi government also was trying to satisfyChristian demands for withdrawing Syria's 40,000 troops withdrawfrom Lebanon.   In Beirut, an aide to Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun todayurged Christian lawmakers to leave the conference if there is noagreement by Friday.   ``We demand clear guarantees that the Syrians would withdraw,''said Farouk Abillama, secretary general of Aoun's Foreign Ministryand one of the general's closest advisers.   Abillama, after a meeting with the Christian leader, toldreporters that Maronite Christian parliamentary deputies haveagreed to political reform that would shift some power to theMoslems.   ``So let them give us something in return,'' he said. TheChristian deputies ``should return in 24 hours if they fail toreach agreement,'' he said at midday.   Arab diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said SaudiForeign Minister Prince Saud arrived unexpectedly in Damascus lateWednesday carrying a letter from King Fahd on the issue.   Presidential spokesman Jibrane Kourieh said Syrian VicePresident Abdul-Halim Khaddam and Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaaalso attended the meeting.   Saud was expected to meet with Lebanese Christians in Taif latertoday to discuss results of the trip.   The Lebanese parliament has been meeting in Taif under theauspices of the Arab League for the past 20 days to try to settlethat nation's 14-year-old civil war.   Talks have been at a standstill for days over the Christians'call for guarantees that the Syrians will withdraw.   The Syrians have been in Lebanon since 1976 under an Arab Leaguepeacekeeping mandate and have become the main power brokers in thecountry.   The Christians, led by Aoun, charge that Damascus violated itsmandate by siding with the Moslems and have declared a ``war ofliberation'' against the Syrians.   Conference sources said Saud has advised the Christians that theguarantees they seek would be contained in amendments to a peaceaccord.   They also said Syria's agreement to the proposed amendmentswould cool opposition from Lebanon's Moslem lawmakers and allow theTaif conference to move ahead to discussion of a new power-sharingagreement.   The 33 Christian and 30 Moslem lawmakers have agreed topolitical reforms that would give some of the power of thetraditionally dominant Christians to Moslems.   But Aoun has insisted that without guarantees of a Syrianpullout a peace settlement cannot be completed. Any peace accordworked out in Taif must be approved by the militia commanders inLebanon.   An Arab League mediating committee of Saudi Arabia, Morocco andAlgeria has proposed a two-year phased withdrawal of the Syriansfrom the Beirut area.   The troops would be redeployed in Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valleyuntil a strong central government were established and the nationsigned a security pact with Syria.   Aoun, however, has insisted that Syrian troops begin leavingLebanon as soon a charter for national reconciliation is ratifiedby a parliamentiary session in Beirut.</TEXT></DOC>
