(800)833-6687, (415) 961-4400.andM;List Price: $99.andM;Requires: 1MB RAM (2MB recommended); hard disk; 286, 386, or greaterprocessor; Windows 3.0; Windows-compatible printer and monitor; DOS 3.1.andM;In Short: On-the-fly screen and printer fonts for Windows using Type 1PostScript fonts--the most widely available typefaces on the market for PCs.andM;Scalable on-the-fly screen and printer fonts for Windows have become therage.andP;  Just a few weeks after Bitstream released its $99 FaceLift (FirstLooks, November 27, 1990), Adobe now offers its long-awaited $99 PC versionof Adobe Type Manager (ATM), ported from the Macintosh.andP;  More entries fromZenographics and AGFA Compugraphic are pending.andM;Adobe's utility comes with 13 scalable fonts and provides the simplest, mosttransparent way to add scalable fonts to virtually any Windows printer anddisplay screen.andP;  Unlike FaceLift, which uses only the 200 typefaces availablein Bitstream's new Speedo font format, ATM builds screen and printer fontsfrom any of the hundreds of Type 1 PostScript soft fonts available from Adobeand many other vendors.andM;In addition to providing PostScript fonts on screen, ATM uses PostScripttypeface outlines to create bitmap fonts for non-PostScript printers.andP;  Thismeans that dot matrix and LaserJet users can print text that, within thehardware limits of their printers, is identical to the text printed onPostScript printers.andP;  Because ATM is a second-generation PostScript fontrasterizer, the PostScript text it produces on a LaserJet is sharper andclearer than the text produced by printers like the Apple LaserWriter IINTXwhich use Adobe's first-generation PostScript interpreter.andM;Neither ATM nor FaceLift affects graphics printing.andP;  You still need aPostScript printer (or software PostScript interpreter) to print .EPS files.andO;Although both ATM and FaceLift work with most Windows printers, FaceLiftcan't create printer fonts on the fly for LaserMaster printers; ATM can.andM;If you use Windows 3.0 in standard or enhanced mode, you don't have to choosebetween FaceLift and ATM, for the two coexist transparently in the samesystem.andP;  If you use Windows in real mode or Windows 2.x, you can't use ATM atall; you can use FaceLift.andM;The amount of RAM taken up by each program depends on the nature of yourcomputer system.andP;  On a 386 with 8MB of RAM, FaceLift needs about 60K in itsdefault setting, and ATM about 240K.andM;ATM comes with the original 13 PostScript fonts--four weights each of TimesRoman, Helvetica, and Courier, plus Symbol.andP;  A $198 Plus Pack has theremaining 22 fonts needed to match the 35 in most PostScript printers.andM;More than 750 other hinted Type 1 soft fonts are available for the PC fromAdobe, Monotype, and Linotype.andP;  ATM also works with the hundreds of unhintedthird-party Type 1 fonts available from Image Club and other sources, but theprinted output will be rougher than with hinted fonts.andP;  Even among hintedfonts, you're likely to notice a difference between Adobe's fonts and thosefrom other vendors.andP;  When printing to a LaserJet using ATM, for example,Adobe fonts tend to have smoother edges and more consistent line widths thanthe less extensively hinted fonts from Monotype.andM;ATM is designed to be installed and then forgotten.andP;  Compared to the ofadjustments available in FaceLift, ATM's control panel offers a minimum setof options.andP;  You can turn ATM on or off, adjust the size of the memory cachein which ATM stores bitmap fonts during the current Windows session, and addmore Type 1 fonts.andM;ATM doesn't give you fine adjustments for dot matrix printers like FaceLift,and doesn't give you a Windows-based option to build standard LaserJet softfonts to use for faster downloading.andP;  Adobe's recent repackaging of its Type1 soft fonts, however, includes a separate DOS-based utility that createsbitmap fonts for the LaserJet from any Type 1 font.andM;FaceLift has an option to create a disk file containing a cache for itsbitmapped fonts, so you can display files quickly without waiting for screenfonts to be regenerated in each session.andP;  ATM doesn't have a disk-basedcache, and the delay in creating fonts can be annoying on a slow system,although unnoticeable at 25 MHz or faster.andM;Like FaceLift, much of ATM's screen performance depends on the underlyingapplication.andP;  When you use on-the-fly screen fonts, Word for Windows andVentura Publisher distractingly rewrite the screen after almost everycharacter you type.andP;  Ami Professional waits for a pause, generally at the endof a line; PageMaker rewrites constantly and without any annoying flicker.andM;Bitstream has announced a version of FaceLift that uses Speedo fonts withWordPerfect.andP;  Adobe has no immediate plans for comparable DOS-based versionsof ATM, but hasn't ruled out the possibility of releasing them in the future.andM;When Adobe started issuing typefaces five years ago, its designs were lessvigorous and less carefully detailed than Bitstream's, but Adobe's morerecent designs have been closing the gap.andP;  Desktop typographers can now enjoyboth Adobe's and Bitstream's designs on the same screen and the same page.andM;Don't waste time choosing between ATM and FaceLift.andP;  Get both.andP;  If you canonly choose one, and you don't already have a directory full of Bitstreamfonts, ATM gives you access to the widest range of type designs with thegreatest transparency and ease.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
