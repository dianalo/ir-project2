So, wetranslate, educators are falling down on the job. As a consequence, Americanchildren's academic skills are lagging further and further behind those ofJapanese and European children.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  THE FAILINGS OF THE PARENTS, NOT THE SCHOOLS, ARETO BLAME  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Family Clipboard; Parenting; John Rosemond is a family psychologist in privatepractice in North Carolina  </MEMO><TEXT>     Conclusion: If we fix &quot;the schools,&quot; we fix the problem.;   What's trulyamazing, however, is &quot;the schools&quot; are dancing as fast as they can todemonstrate their awareness of their shortcomings and their commitment tofixing themselves.;   During a break at a recent conference of educators, oneof the movers and shakers began pitching me on &quot;Competency-Driven Education,&quot;or some such thing, asserting that only CDE could solve &quot;the problem.&quot;;  After listening for a while, I offered, &quot;The problem, in my estimation, liesnot with the schools, but with the way the American parent is rearing theAmerican child. Until we fix the faults in our child-rearing, no educationaldelivery system is going to work. Fix those faults, and just about anydelivery system will work.&quot;;   Fact: A child's education begins at home.;  Fact: Teachers all over the country tell me disproportionate numbers ofchildren of average to above-average ability come to school in a state ofeducational unreadiness. Consequently, they're not performing to theirpotential.;   Conclusion: American parents are falling down on the job.;   Tobe educable, a child must pay attention in class, accept personalresponsibility for assignments given him by his teachers, and be determined tohang in there when the academic going gets rough. Almost without exception,teachers tell me today's typical child doesn't pay attention, makes everyattempt to avoid responsibility, and gives up at the first twinge offrustration.;   This generation of American parents acts as if it's more theirresponsibility to pay attention to their children than it is their children'sresponsibility to pay attention to them. This generation of American children,by and large, has no assignment in the family. They receive in abundance, yetlittle, if anything, is required of them in and around the home.;   To say theschools need fixing is like saying the cart should be in front of the horse.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  John Rosemond column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911222  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4L  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  404  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, December 22, 199100357003,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
