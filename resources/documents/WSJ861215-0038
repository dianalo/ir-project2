The agency also said it has decided to repair the facility's controversial &quot;N&quot; reactor, which was found to have safety weaknesses.    The department said that in about three weeks it will close for six months the important weapons-grade plutonium plant -- which has some design features similar to the Soviet Union's Chernobyl plant -- to make extensive safety-related tests and improvements.    Westinghouse officials quickly signaled their intent to cut costs at the 570-square-mile site and raised the possibility that some workers could be laid off. &quot;We believe we can achieve these (cost) improvements by managing attrition,&quot; said William R. Jacobi, president of the newly formed Westinghouse unit that will manage the site. &quot;If funding for Hanford programs remains relatively steady, we believe we can avoid a major reduction in the work force.&quot; About 10,000 employees are involved in Westinghouse's five-year contract.    The Energy Department released reports from its outside consultants that highlighted safety weaknesses at the 23-year-old &quot;N&quot; reactor. Five of the agency's six consultants said the reactor falls short of the safety standards applied to commercial nuclear power plants, and two recommended shutting it down unless national security considerations override safety ones.    Four of the consultants said the reactor could be operated with adequate safety after certain repairs. Yet even these experts said the reactor will have to be closed or subjected to a very expensive overhaul during the 1990s. The problems are likely to increase pressure to build a new plant.    Energy Undersecretary Joseph Salgado said national defense needs for nuclear weapons production require keeping the aging reactor operating for now. He called the &quot;N&quot; reactor &quot;a critical and unique&quot; defense weapons facility.    The Energy Department commissioned the consultants' review of the &quot;N&quot; reactor after the accident at the Soviet Union's Chernobyl nuclear plant last spring. Though different from the Soviet reactor in many respects, the &quot;N&quot; reactor is similar in some important ones. It is the only U.S. reactor that uses water-cooled graphite to moderate the nuclear chain reaction. And like the Chernobyl plant, it lacks a structure designed to withstand high pressures while containing radioactive releases in case of an accident.    In the past, agency officials have denied that their weapons plants present greater public risks than commercial nuclear plants. On Friday, they avoided addressing that question directly. Delbert Bunch, a deputy assistant energy secretary, said in an interview that the &quot;N&quot; reactor's comparative safety is &quot;a judgment call.&quot;    He said the agency expects to complete a statistically precise risk assessment next spring. &quot;I think we'll be okay,&quot; he said.    Generally, the agency's outside consultants said, a serious accident at the &quot;N&quot; reactor probably would cause more harm than one at a commercial plant because the Hanford reactor could generate more explosive hydrogen gas than a commercial plant, and because its ability to contain radiation is questionable.    &quot;The N reactor is not as safe as our U.S. commercial plants,&quot; summarized consultant Eugene Wilkinson, a retired Navy admiral.    Adm. Wilkinson and consultant Harold Lewis both complained about evidence of &quot;complacency&quot; in the staff operating the plant. Adm. Wilkinson said this complacency extends from employees of contractors to Energy Department staff.    The consultants agreed, though, that the &quot;N&quot; reactor isn't capable of duplicating the Chernobyl accident. Some, including Adm. Wilkinson, said it can be operated &quot;safely.&quot;    The department's Mr. Salgado said the planned improvements in the &quot;N&quot; reactor will cost about $50 million. They include changes in the emergency cooling system, the installation of a system to close down the plant from a remote location, tests of the radiation-confinement system and installation of systems to limit hydrogen buildup.    But he conceded that even with the improvements, the plant won't be able to operate without a much more substantial overhaul in the early 1990s.    After Westinghouse assumes responsibility for the plant, the Boeing Computer Services subsidiary of Seattle-based Boeing Co. will be Westinghouse's only subcontractor on the job and will handle communications and computers. Boeing said its share of the contract would total about $375 million.    For Westinghouse, the contract provides some additional prestige for its push into the burgeoning toxic-waste management and disposal industry. &quot;We're committed to the nuclear industry in the long term, and this provides us the perfect complement to our existing businesses,&quot; a spokesman said.    Under the contract to manage the Hanford facilities, Westinghouse is to take sole direction of work it currently shares with subsidiaries of Rockwell International Corp., UNC Resources Inc. and Boeing Computer Services.    Westinghouse already manages five government projects, including the Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory in Pennsylvania and a naval reactor facility in Idaho. </TEXT></DOC>
