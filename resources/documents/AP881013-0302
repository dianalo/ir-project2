Legislation to expand the insurance fund's borrowing limit from$10.8 billion in bonds to $15.8 billion was strongly opposed bylobbyists for the industry, which is paying an extra assessment toretire the 30-year bonds.   By indefinitely postponing debate, the House Rules Committee onWednesday effectively blocked the measure until next year.   Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y., the sponsor of the bill, had arguedit is better for government regulators to obtain money throughbonds paid off by the industry than to rely more heavily onpromissory notes, which could eventually have to be paid by thetaxpayers.   ``I think the industry killed the bill. I think the U.S. League(of Savings Institutions) killed the bill because they want thetaxpayers to bail out the industry. They do not want to engage inany self help. This has been their plan from Day One,'' LaFalcesaid Wednesday in a telephone interview.   ``The public is unaware of what's been going on. There's noother lobby group but the industry itself and the industry says,`Let someone else solve the problem','' he said.   Mark Clark, senior vice president of the U.S. League, thelargest Sandamp;L trade group, said the House panel's action wasappropriate. He said legislators should fashion a comprehensivesolution to the Sandamp;L financial crisis next year rather thanhurriedly pass a piecemeal bill this fall.   Congress expects to adjourn for the year this week or next.   Clark said healthy Sandamp;Ls have already paid about $4 billion morethan the normal assessment for deposit insurance. He said the extrapayments so far this year caused 69 solvent institutions to losemoney.   In related action, the full House refused to abolish amuch-criticized federal agency created to manage and sell offproperty and other assets from failed Sandamp;Ls.   The House voted 247-130 to abolish the Federal Asset DispositionAssociation, but the measure failed because it fell five votesshort of a needed two-thirds majority.   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates the nation's3,000 Sandamp;Ls, created FADA in 1985 as a quasi-public agency with itsown board of directors made up of industry representatives.   Lawmakers have accused FADA of mismanagement, favoritism,conflicts of interest and of lavish spending on salaries as high as$250,000 a year. The House Banking Committee on Oct. 4 voted 42-8to transfer its duties back to the Sandamp;L insurance fund. The eightcommittee Republicans opposing the bill charged it was politicallymotivated.</TEXT></DOC>
