Late last year, the 11-bank holding company applied for Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. &quot;open bank&quot; assistance that would, if approved, inject some fresh capital into BancTexas and give it time to work out its problems. That application, which is still pending, came after two earlier suitors pulled out of a bailout plan after the FDIC rejected their proposals for assistance.    Sources say the FDIC has all but rejected the idea of letting BancTexas work out its own problems. The focus now is on assisting an outsider that would provide capital for the banking concern. Among the top contenders is Hallwood Group Inc., a little-known merchant banker with offices in Cleveland and New York. It has restructured an oil company and a hotel and restaurant chain in Texas, and wants to take control of some banks or thrifts in the Lone Star state.    But Hallwood wants the FDIC to assume some of BancTexas's worse loans, in return for its taking a stake in the company, taking control of management and paying creditors. By March 31, BancTexas must pay off about $24.2 million in loans to its lender banks. It has already defaulted on agreements with the lenders to come up with a plan to pay off the borrowings.    But it isn't known whether the FDIC will approve such a plan. As an alternative, an unidentified, out-of-state bank has been studying BancTexas as a possible acquisition for the past several weeks. On Jan. 1, a Texas law took effect that allows interstate acquisitions of banks and thrifts.    An FDIC official said a decision about assistance will be made &quot;in the not-too-distant future,&quot; but he didn't elaborate. Other sources said an announcement could come as early as today.    Both Hallwood and BancTexas declined to comment. Last year, Hallwood said it was interested specifically in BancTexas, and it confirmed recently that it was reconsidering investing in the company, which has $1.3 billion in assets.    In a recent report to shareholders, Richard L. Ripley, BancTexas president and chief executive officer, said the future of the company &quot;remains uncertain.&quot;    Like many Texas banks, BancTexas is saddled with sour real estate and energy loans. In the first nine months of 1986, it had a loss of $35.2 million. It has been a steady borrower of emergency funds from the Federal Reserve Bank in Dallas, averaging $135 million a day, as it struggles to maintain liquidity. </TEXT></DOC>
