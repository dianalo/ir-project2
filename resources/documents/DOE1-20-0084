<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-20-0084 </DOCNO><TEXT>Mutual diffusion coefficients at infinite dilution have been measuredfor hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide in the solvents n-heptane,n-dodecane, and n-hexadecane. The data cover the temperature range from25 to 293{sup 0}C and pressures of 1415 and 3450 kPa. The Taylor dispersionmethod was used for diffusion measurements. It was found that the Sovovacorrelation for diffusion of dissolved gases in liquids failed to predictdiffusivities at temperatures above ambient. A free-volume approach tocorrelation is indicated instead.</TEXT></DOC>
