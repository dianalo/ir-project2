Ms. Marshall, 50 years old, ran the huge California fund, one of the nation's largest institutional investors, since 1985. The fund manages about $45 billion.    The California post was &quot;a terrific job, but I would prefer to be in an organization with less bureaucracy and hierarchy,&quot; Ms. Marshall said in a telephone interview. She said she wanted a job with fewer administrative details and more direct involvement in money management. She added, &quot;I don't think people should spend much more than three to five years in the same job.&quot;    Ms. Marshall announced her decision to leave late last year without saying what she planned to do next. Her three-year contract expired at the end of last month. Previously, she was president of BayBanks Investment Management Co. in Boston and had also been director of investments at Deere andamp; Co. in Moline, Ill.    The new firm, founded by Ms. Marshall and three associates, will have offices in San Francisco and Boston. It doesn't have any clients yet, Ms. Marshall said, &quot;because I was too busy working&quot; at the California fund job until last week.    Ms. Marshall will be chief executive officer and director of investments. Marz Garcia, 51, a former California state senator and a former Bank of America executive, will be responsible for business development and administration. Most recently, he was a financial consultant.    Thomas M. Roginski, 44, will be research director and also will manage the Boston office. He has been in the investment management business 16 years and has worked on developing computer systems to help money managers select and trade securities.    The other founder is Muriel Siebert, president of a New York City brokerage firm bearing her name. Ms. Siebert is a former New York state superintendent of banking. She will be &quot;an adviser&quot; to the firm and help with business development, Ms. Marshall said.    The new firm will offer asset management and securities trading services to public and corporate pension plans, college and university endowment funds and charitable and religious organizations. Ms. Marshall said the firm is committed to hiring and training women and minorities to fill professional positions at the firm.    The firm has an unusual fee structure. Investment managers typically charge a percentage of the amount of money being managed. Instead, Ms. Marshall's firm will charge a fixed annual fee of $100,000 plus an incentive fee based on how well the firm performs above a benchmark index.    Ms. Marshall plans to keep her house in Sacramento but will spend much of her time &quot;in an airplane somewhere,&quot; she said. In addition to the Boston and San Francisco offices, the firm also may open an office in New York.    Asked if she felt nervous about giving up a secure job and starting a new venture, Ms. Marshall said she enjoyed taking risks. One of her favorite sports is sky diving, even though she broke her ankle doing it last year. </TEXT></DOC>
