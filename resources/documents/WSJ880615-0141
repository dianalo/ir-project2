Investors will decide at Texaco's annual meeting Friday if Mr. Icahn, who has bid $60 a share for the company, should have five board seats.    True, Mr. Icahn revived TWA. In 1985, before he took charge, it wrung a paltry $21 million of cash flow from operations. In 1987, cash flow was $306 million, thanks to lower labor and other costs, says Julius Maldutis, a Salomon analyst. And TWA has undertaken &quot;a big thrust into Florida and expansion of international routes,&quot; says Joseph Corr, TWA's president. Shares of TWA, which Mr. Icahn plans to take private in an offer valued at about $35 a share, have doubled since early 1986. Mr. Icahn expects to complete the buy-out by September.    But analysts decry TWA's skimpy capital spending, especially for new planes. They say Mr. Icahn uses TWA mainly to finance investments, particularly in USX and in Texaco, where his 14.8% stake cost more than $1 billion. Mr. Icahn &quot;gets a less than average grade for long-term positioning&quot; of TWA, says Timothy Pettee, a Bear Stearns analyst. TWA's planes, which have an average age of 14 years, are the oldest of any U.S. carrier and are costly to maintain, he says; &quot;upscale fliers notice the difference.&quot;    In 1987, TWA's capital spending was $76 million, much less than in 1977, according to Salomon. AMR Corp. and Delta Air Lines each spent more than $1 billion in 1987 -- four times their 1977 outlays. But Mr. Corr says Salomon's figures exclude commitments to lease 10 new planes in 1987. TWA now is negotiating to buy or lease $500 million of MD-80 planes, he adds.    Meanwhile, says one investment banker, Mr. Icahn has leveraged TWA's assets -- selling and leasing back planes and equipment -- to extract cash for raids. In 1985, TWA had $1.4 billion of long-term debt and leases but only $169 million of cash. By 1987, debt and leases were $2.6 billion; cash and securities were $1.2 billion. TWA's 1986 purchase of Ozark Airlines was typical: It promptly recovered its $240 million cost by mortgaging Ozark's fleet.    Now, TWA's long-term liabilities are nine times greater than its equity, making it vulnerable to setbacks and ill-equipped for &quot;large-scale aircraft replacement programs,&quot; says Mr. Maldutis.    Recently, Mr. Icahn proposed forming an acquisition vehicle -- a sort of buy-out fund -- that would use TWA for personal ventures, including his battle for Texaco. The vehicle's equity capital would include his TWA stake, currently about 77%, and 36 million Texaco shares held in TWA and elsewhere. The public would be tapped for an additional $500 million to $750 million of equity and about $2.5 billion of subordinated debt.    Currently, TWA's 20 million-share Texaco stake shows a $300 million gain, enough for quite a few planes. But Mr. Icahn's new fund would &quot;use the higher value (of TWA's Texaco stake) to support higher borrowing&quot; for takeovers, says Robert Willens, a corporate finance specialist at Shearson Lehman Hutton.    Last December, when Texaco was in bankruptcy-law proceedings, Mr. Icahn sold half TWA's newly purchased Texaco stock to ACF Industries, his leasing company -- &quot;to spread the risks,&quot; he says. But Texaco, at 50 3/8 yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, has since soared, prompting some TWA holders to sue to rescind the sale. Mr. Corr says the suit is &quot;inactive.&quot;    Under Mr. Icahn's buy-out bid, minority TWA holders would receive cash and debentures. He'd take 90% of the newly private TWA, plus cash &quot;or cash-equivalent consideration.&quot; One Icahn watcher thinks the investor, in a replay of the ACF deal, might take valuable Texaco stock in lieu of cash. &quot;I might take Texaco stock from TWA to leave (the carrier) with cash for new planes,&quot; Mr. Icahn says. Wall Street is never satisfied, he adds. &quot;One minute they're angry, saying I shouldn't buy stock&quot; with TWA money. &quot;The next minute, they say I shouldn't take TWA's Texaco stock.&quot;    TWA seems to have bought Texaco stock with some $800 million borrowed last September for an earlier TWA buy-out plan. Mr. Icahn &quot;has gone and played the stock market and he's won so far,&quot; says a New York money manager, but people who invest with him &quot;should make sure they know where the money's going.&quot;    Yesterday Kohlberg Kravis appeared to have sold a big Texaco stake; TWA wouldn't say if it was the buyer.    ---   Trans World Airlines   (NYSE; Symbol: TWA)   Business: Airline   Year ended Dec. 31, 1987:   Revenue: $4.06 billion   Net income: $106.2 million; $1.65 a share   Average daily trading volume:   56,888 shares   Common shares outstanding: 30.5 million</TEXT></DOC>
