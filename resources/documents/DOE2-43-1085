The TM{sub 01} mode of the metal grating waveguide interactswith a cold, dense, mildly relativistic electron beam which is constrainedto move along the axis of the waveguide. Since the interaction fieldsevanesce away from the slow wave supporting structure, a beam-gratinggap is included in the analysis. Results indicate appreciable gain atlower mm wavelengths over a 30-cm interaction length at electron acceleratingvoltages as low as 20 kV. Interaction between the forward wave regionof the n = 0 space harmonic and the electron beam slow-space-charge wavecould result in output wavelengths as low as 400-{mu}m at 250-kV acceleratingvoltages.</TEXT></DOC>
