The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. packaged 20 MCorp subsidiarybanks into a new, government-owned institution with $15.4 billionin assets and $11.6 billion in deposits. Left alone were fivestill-solvent subsidiary banks and a trust company.   L. William Seidman, chairman of the FDIC, which insurescommercial bank deposits up to $100,000, said the agency will seekbuyers for the new institution.   He declined to estimate how much government aid will ultimatelybe required, saying he did not want to reveal the figure topotential bidders.   Private analysts have said they expect the failure will cost theFDIC, already depleted by a post-Depression record of 221 bankfailures last year, $1 billion to $2 billion.   That would make the transaction the third most costly commercialbank rescue, after Continental Illinois of Chicago in 1984 andFirst RepublicBank of Dallas in 1988, which required initialgovernment pledges of $4.5 billion and $4 billion, respectively.Both, like MCorp, were holding companies.   The FDIC insurance fund suffered its first loss ever in 1988,declining from $18.3 billion to $14 billion. Seidman said the fundshould break even this year, even with spending for MCorp.   As part of legislation to bail out the savings and loanindustry, President Bush is proposing to build up the commercialbank insurance fund by nearly doubling the deposit insurancepremium paid by banks.   Earlier this year, when the FDIC was trying to sell MCorp in itsentirety, the agency had set an April 3 deadline for offers, butSeidman said that may be extended.   ``We are going to proceed with the sale as promptly aspossible,'' he said.   In Dallas, MCorp said the five remaining banks and the trustsubsidiary ``form the nucleus of a new beginning for MCorp,'' whichintends to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.   ``While the nature of MCorp has been altered dramatically, asolid, healthy core remains,'' Chairman Gene H. Bishop said.   Seidman said the failed banks opened for business today and ``asfar as the customers are concerned it will be business as usual.''   MCorp, which has 86 offices, lost $903 million from its bankingoperations last year. It is the last of the large Texas banksneeding to be recapitalized, either through federal rescue orprivate merger. The bulk of the assets were in the subsidiaries inDallas, $6.4 billion, and Houston, $3.2 billion.   Until last year, many analysts had thought MCorp, which had notinvested as heavily in energy projects as other Texas banks, mightsurvive. But heavy losses on real estate loans evenutally draggedit under.   Comptroller of the Currency Robert Clarke, the chief regulatorof nationally chartered banks, said the failures were triggered bydemands beginning Monday on the lead bank in Dallas, both fromdepositors and from the other banks in the holding company.   On Tuesday, ``it became clear as the day wore on that the(Dallas) bank was not going to be able to meet the demands ofdepositors,'' Clarke said. Five of the banks had been insolvent ontheir; 15 more failed after the Dallas bank could not meet theirdemands for deposits. The demands of all outside customers weremet, he said.   Federal action was complicated by the fact that regulatorslegally could not take control of the five MCorp subsidiary banksthat remain solvent. A legal battle is developing between privatecreditors and the FDIC over assets held by the holding company.   Regulators claim holding company assests should be used to deferfederal costs in rescuing the insolvent subsidiary banks, but MCorphas resisted.   Seidman declined to say how large the claim against the holdingcompany is except that it is ``substantial.'' The insurance fundlast year had been trying to force the holding company to inject$400 million into 18 of its banks.   For future cases, the FDIC is seeking legislation from Congressthat would permit it to force solvent subsidiary banks to back upsister institutions that fail.   The FDIC's move came a week after creditors of MCorp forced itto seek protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code.The holding company had halted payments on $466 million in debtlast October but had asked creditors to refrain from pressing theirclaims while it attempted to work out an assistance agreement withthe FDIC.   The FDIC appointed James Gardner, chairman of MBank Dallas, aspresident of its new government-owned institution. The agency saidit will seek a new chairman from outside the MCorp system.   Reportedly among those interested in buying MCorp is A. RobertAbboud, chairman of Houston's First City Bancorporation, which wasitself rescued by the FDIC in 1987 with $1 billion.   Other likely bidders are Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., thePritzker family of Chicago and a group led by Harry Gray, formerchairman of United Technologies Corp.   The 20 MCorp banks seized are MBank Abilene, MBank Alamo, MBankAustin, MBank Brenham, MBank Corsicana, MBank Dallas, MBank DentonCounty, MBank Fort Worth, MBank Greenville, MBank Houston, MBankJefferson, MBank Longview, MBank Marshall, MBank Midcities, MBankOdessa, MBank Orange, MBank Round Rock, MBank Sherman, MBankWichita Falls and MBank The Woodlands.   The five banks remaining solvent are MBank Brownsville, MBankCorpus Christi, MBank Waco, MBank El Paso and MBank New Braunfels.A sixth subsidiary, MTrust Corp., also remains solvent.</TEXT></DOC>
