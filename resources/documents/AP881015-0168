The ruling gives the Bell companies 75 days to begin routinglong-distance calls that are not dialed directly to thelong-distance carrier to which the caller has presubscribed, suchas MCI or Sprint.   Calls placed with a Bell calling card, or which use a Belloperator, now go over ATandamp;T lines automatically unless the callerhas a credit card with another company and uses an access code tobypass the local Bell operator and reach that long-distance carrier.   Thus the ruling applies primarily to non-ATandamp;T long-distancecustomers who, for whatever reason, do not carry a non-ATandamp;T creditcard. It also will allow holders of such cards to charge localcalls, which now can be done only with a Bell card.   U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene ordered the Bell companies``to cease discriminating in favor of ATandamp;T'' with respect to theircalling cards and pay phones by Jan. 1, 1989 _ the fifthanniversary of the court order that stripped ATandamp;T of its localoperating companies.   ``Five years is long enough'' for the Baby Bells, as they arecalled, to provide equal access to their local networks for alllong-distance companies, ``and the court expects the parties tomeet its deadline,'' Greene said.   Callers using credit cards issued by MCI Communications Corp.,US Sprint Communications Co. and other ATandamp;T competitors are notafforded the same services as ATandamp;T and Bell card holders. Forexample, they are unable to charge local calls to their card or tocharge long-distance calls made through a Bell operator.   Before divestiture, when American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. andthe local companies were part of the giant Bell System, they usedthe same database to validate and bill credit-card calls.   After divestiture, because of the use of the common database,ATandamp;T and the Bell companies issued the same calling card number forany particular customer.   Consequently, all long-distance calls made with Bell cards weredirected to ATandamp;T. Also, calls from Bell-owned pay phones also wererouted to ATandamp;T.   MCI, the nation's second-largest long-distance company afterATandamp;T, complained about the arrangement to the Justice Department,which asked Greene to stop the Bells from discriminating in favorof ATandamp;T.   In his decision, Greene ordered the Bells by Jan. 1 to makeavailable to all long-distance carriers the same validation datafor its calling cards that the company provides to ATandamp;T ``on thesame prices, terms and conditions as are extended to ATandamp;T.'' Thismeans Bell card-holders will be able to charge long-distance callsto their carrier of choice.   He also ruled that the owners of premises where Bell pay phonesare located will be able to choose by Jan. 1 which long-distancecompany the calls from that phone will be routed to.   Nearly half of all calls from Bell pay phones areoperator-assisted, yielding more than $1 billion in revenues a year_ most of it to ATandamp;T, Greene said.   In addition, Greene said the Baby Bells must inform itscalling-card customers that long-distance calls charged to the cardwill be provided by a long-distance company _ not the Bell company_ but not always the carrier to which they presubscribed as a``dial-1'' service on their home phone.   The judge also said the regional companies could keep incirculation _ but only for ATandamp;T customers _ Bell credit cards thatcarry the same international number as used by ATandamp;T, provided theyissue cards to other customers listing the international number ofthe long-distance company to which they presubscribed.</TEXT></DOC>
