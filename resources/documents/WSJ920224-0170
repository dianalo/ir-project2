Trade Representative Carla Hills warned the EC thatPresident Bush will impose trade sanctions on the communityif it enacts government procurement policies thatdiscriminate against U.S. suppliers of telecommunications andheavy electrical equipment. These policies are written intoan EC directive that is to take effect in January. Thedirective would allow the provisions to be waived if the ECis assured of comparable access to the U.S. market, but theU.S. and the EC are far from agreeing on how they can swapmarket-access benefits.</LP><TEXT>   The U.S. and the EC are trying to find that elusive accordin the current round of negotiations under the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, as well as through theirparticipation in a separate effort to redraft the GATTgovernment procurement code.   While the impasse with the EC could drag on for severalmore months, U.S. suppliers stand to benefit immediately fromthe South Korean pact. Mrs. Hills said it will give them a&quot;fair shot&quot; at the &quot;fastest-growing sectors&quot; of a market nowtotaling $5 billion annually.   The agreement calls for the Korean government to simplifythe regulations affecting foreign providers oftelecommunications services and to allow them to hook upKorean subscribers to international value-added networks,which give subscribers instant access to overseas data bases.Seoul also has promised to speed up its schedule for reducingtariffs on telecommunications equipment.   At the same time, U.S. vendors will have greater access tothe procurement business of Korea Telecom, a state-ownedmonopoly that eventually may be transformed into a publiclytraded company like Japan's NTT Corp. &quot;The news about Koreais very good,&quot; said Herb Linen, a spokesman for AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph Co. &quot;We wish we had similar success inthe EC.&quot;   The EC delegation in Washington read Mrs. Hills'sannouncement merely as an attempt by the U.S. to gain&quot;negotiating leverage,&quot; and said that the threat of sanctions&quot;is not conducive to successful negotiations.&quot;   Both the EC and South Korea were identified in 1989 as&quot;priority&quot; areas under a provision of the 1988 trade actaimed at breaking down barriers in foreign telecommunicationsmarkets. Friday was the deadline for negotiating the removalof such barriers in the two areas, but the U.S. recognizesthat more time is needed to break the impasse with the EC.   At the root of the stalemate are the different structuresof the U.S. and EC telecommunications markets. The U.S. wantsthe EC's state-owned telecommunications agencies to adoptnondiscriminatory buying practices that the GATT has endorsedfor government agencies as a rule. The EC won't do that untilthe U.S. agrees to modify the so-called special rights thatATandamp;T and the Bell regional companies have retained under theATandamp;T divestiture rules, and allow more European participationin this market.   ATandamp;T is opposed to such concessions. &quot;The U.S. market iswide open,&quot; Mr. Linen insisted. &quot;A number of Europeancompanies are already operating, unfettered, in this market.&quot;   At the same time, the U.S. is trying to break down some ofthe barriers that General Electric Co. is encountering in itsattempts to sell steam turbines to EC utilities. The ECdirective that takes effect in January, for instance, willallow those utilities to pass up equipment with less than a50% EC content. The directive also will give preference to ECbidders even if their prices are slightly higher than thoseof foreign competitors.</TEXT></DOC>
