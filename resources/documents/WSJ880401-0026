The financially troubled Pasadena, Calif.-based concern said its board authorized the program to redeem &quot;any or all of the company's zero coupon notes,&quot;swhich are repayable in September. If more money is raised through the asset sale, Beverly plans to use those proceeds to reduce debt and for other purposes.    Beverly has about $725 million of debt, much of it resulting from a stock-repurchase program that began prior to last October's market collapse.    Robert Van Tuyle, chairman, said the assets that may be sold under the program include as many as 15,000 to 20,000 long-term care beds. Beverly also is considering selling certain notes receivable from asset sales, and &quot;sale and lease-back of some assets and a mortgage loan program.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
