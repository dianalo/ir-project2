The Beggs prosecution follows what is becoming a familiar Washington pattern: Legislators intent on defeating policies they don't like have taken to smearing unpopular individuals with a cascade of accusations. They make appeals to criminal laws and prosecutors respond. Indictments follow. But it turns out that getting convictions is something else again.    The proximate cause of the Beggs case was the obsession some members of Congress developed over $600 toilet seats. Waving the Pentagon's toilet seats in the air, legislators called for heads to roll. Mr. Beggs stepped down as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in late 1985 when he was indicted along with his former employer, General Dynamics, and three other officials for bilking the government on the now-canceled Sergeant York anti-aircraft gun project. Prosecutors claimed that the firm overcharged the government between 1978 and 1981 when costs overran the $39 million contract for developing a prototype. The defendants said government prosecutors didn't understand the government's own procurement contract.    There are two kinds of procurement contracts. One is the usual &quot;fixed-price&quot; contract, which means that contractors must complete the work for one, agreed-on price. The other is unique to defense contracting. As George Melloan describes on the page opposite, the Pentagon does business Soviet-style, so it has not a little difficulty telling contractors exactly what it wants. (See: &quot;Business World: Even Generals Get the Arms Procurement Blues&quot; -- WSJ June 23, 1987.) This makes future cost estimates unreliable, and so the Pentagon sometimes invites bids for &quot;best-effort&quot; contracts. These agreements are signals that the government and the contractor will both make good-faith efforts to finish the job at the specified price.    The Sergeant York contract said General Dynamics would make its &quot;best efforts&quot; to stay within the contract price. But when the $39 million ran out, the company charged $3.2 million to government Randamp;D accounts and spent $13 million of its own money to finish the job. The government charged that the firm was &quot;pillaging the U.S. Treasury.&quot;    The case began when accountants from the Defense Department's Contract Audit Agency referred the case to prosecutors at the Justice Department's Defense Procurement Fraud Unit. This group of would-be Eliot Nesses was formed jointly by the Defense and Justice departments to fend off the toilet-seat genre of congressional outrage. Any contract lawyer not under extreme pressure to misconstrue the agreement would have spotted the fatal problem with the indictment. (Lawyers involved say the first signs the Justice Department was backing away appeared when the trial lawyer who managed the case after the indictment left to become an associate counsel under Iran-Contra special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh.)    What we have here is a case of waste, fraud and prosecutorial abuse. The government compounded its error by refusing until now to admit it made a mistake. A federal prosecutor reacted to the company's defense that this was a best-effort contract by saying this argument was &quot;strained and convoluted&quot; and a &quot;smoke screen.&quot; Last Friday, the government acknowledged that the allegations &quot;are not supported by sufficient evidence.&quot; No evidence was required. The case was frivolous based on the clear language of the contract.    It should be noted that Mr. Beggs was preoccupied by this witch hunt, and relieved of his NASA post in December 1985. In January 1986, the Challenger went down. Several books on the subject, including &quot;Prescription for Disaster&quot; by Joseph Trento, point to Mr. Beggs suddenly being forced to hand over the reins to a new administrator as a major force for weakening agency management. Mr. Beggs said yesterday that if he had still been on the job, he would have been on the pad to decide if it was too cold to launch.    Some congressmen are now fretting that the failure to make a case against General Dynamics will crimp the defense-fraud prosecutors. Good. These prosecutors could use a chilling. Another case against General Dynamics, arising from a Navy contract, was closed by the Justice Department last month for lack of evidence.    This is the latest in a string of recent prosecutorial indiscretions. Mr. Beggs joins former Labor Department chief Ray Donovan as the most recent Reagan officials forced to endure years-long investigations before being cleared. The &quot;independent prosecutors&quot; investigating Iran-Contra and Michael Deaver tried to rewrite the laws of diplomatic immunity to get an Israeli secret agent and a Canadian ambassador to testify. These new, highly politicized prosecutors share a common flaw: a refusal to adhere to the usual, well-established norms of behavior of federal prosecutors. The Beggs case is another reason why the executive branch must be wary when legislators try to usurp its prosecutorial authority. </TEXT></DOC>
