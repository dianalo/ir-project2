<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-06-0989 </DOCNO><TEXT>Conducted in Palm Springs, California, a joint effort between SERI andJames Howden and Company involved a comprehensive test program on the330-kW Howden wind turbine with a three-bladed, fixed-hub rotor 26 min diameter. Part of the measurement analysis is to quantify the turbulenceloads during the steady-state production modes of operation. Assumingwind turbulence to be the cause of the random loads, the turbulence loadsin terms of blade root-bending moments have been determined empiricallyby isolating the random or nonperiodic part of the load signals usingazimuthal averaging. Standard deviations as functions of wind speed,as well as power spectra of the loads, are presented. The measured turbulenceloads are compared to a recently developed model for turbulence loadingof wind turbines. The model works in the frequency domain and uses thestandard engineering representation of turbulence in terms of a coherencefunction and a wind-power spectrum at a fixed point in space. The turbulenceload model accounts for the dominant mode of vibration for the load inquestion and is intended to be simple enough to be used for a preliminaryload estimate for practical design purposes.</TEXT></DOC>
