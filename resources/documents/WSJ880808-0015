But the government won't come close to recouping its $1.5 billion investment, and it pledged to make up certain of the buyer's losses over the next six years.    The department agreed to sell the facility to Basin Electric Power Cooperative, based in Bismarck, N.D. At a press conference announcing the accord, Energy Secretary John Herrington argued that the proposed sale &quot;removes the government from future subsidies and future liabilities . . . from competing in the business of producing commercial quantities of fuels, and puts business decisions back in the hands of businessmen.&quot;    Under the plan, which will be reviewed by Congress, the Energy Department could receive as much as $1.8 billion over the next 21 years -- the period of the plant's current contracts to sell the gas it produces. In 1988 dollars, however, that $1.8 billion is valued at about $600 million, the department said.    Much of the $1.8 billion is linked to projected energy prices. Basin Electric initially would pay $85 million. If energy prices follow government projections, another $549 million would come from profit-sharing provisions, and $367 million from federal taxes. Basin Electric has agreed to waive certain tax breaks it could use in buying the plant, which the Energy Department estimates at $590 million.    The U.S. would get $105 million more from funds generated since the government took over the plant in 1985. But $75 million of that would be set aside for six years and used to make up losses that Basin Electric may incur from operations.    Basin Electric is a consumer-owned regional cooperative that operates a power station next to the plant, which is known as the Great Plains Coal Gasification Project. The department said it expects Basin Electric to take over within 60 days.    The congressional committees that oversee the plant weren't familiar with the details of the proposed sale late last week. But Rep. Philip Sharp (D., Ind.), who led subcommittee hearings on the plant earlier this year, said he &quot;would take a hard look at it.&quot;    The plant has been sore spot for the Energy Department since a five-member consortium of businesses defaulted on $1.5 billion in government loans in 1985. Built in the early 1980s for $2.1 billion, the facility had its origins in fears a decade ago that an energy shortage could leave the U.S. unable to meet its domestic energy needs. The plant, which uses coal to produce gas for pipelines, is the largest facility of its kind in the world.    The original owners had hoped to sell gas for about $10 per thousand cubic feet. But plunging energy prices drove the price for gas produced at the plant -- tied to a complex formula based on other energy prices -- to about $6 in 1985. That was enough to cover operating costs of $3 per thousand cubic feet, but not enough to pay back the government loans. The price the plant now is receiving for its gas is about $4 per thousand cubic feet.    The Energy Department said it received nine bids and looked closely at three. The two other finalists were Coastal Corp., the parent company of one of the original plant owners, and Mission First Financial, a subsidiary of SCEcorp, formerly Southern California Edison Co.    A Coastal Corp. spokesman said, &quot;We thought we made a realistic bid and could have done a good job at running the plant for the long run,&quot; but wouldn't provide details of the company's offer. Tom McDaniel, president of Mission First Financial, said, &quot;We were serious about our bid. We're disappointed we didn't win.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
