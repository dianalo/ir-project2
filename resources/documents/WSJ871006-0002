In a brief filed yesterday in Washington, USAir criticized a Transportation Department administrative law judge's recommendation last month that the acquisition be rejected because it would give USAir an unfair market advantage at several eastern airports. Judge Ronnie I. Yoder cited Washington National Airport and New York's LaGuardia Airport in particular.    USAir called the judge's decision &quot;a total departure from past (Transportation Department) practices and policy&quot; that have allowed most recent airline acquisition proposals to sail through the regulatory approval process.    USAir shares fell $1.375 to close at $45.75 in composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. Piedmont closed at $64.125 a share, up 87.5 cents.    The filing makes it clear that USAir intends to buck any public or political pressure to end the merger trend in the airline industry. USAir executives don't want to &quot;send out any signal that there is flexibility on their part&quot; with regard to making concessions to other airlines, said Lee M. Hydeman, attorney for USAir.    Several industry analysts had suggested that USAir could resolve some of the judge's anti-competitive concerns by selling slots -- landing and departure rights -- to Phoenix-based America West Airlines Inc., the only carrier that opposed the acquisiton. USAir's brief called America West's position &quot;slotmail.&quot;    The Transportation Department must make a final ruling on the $1.6 billion acquisition proposal by Oct. 30.    John E. Gillick, America West's attorney, said &quot;it appears that (USAir) is going to make the Department of Transportation make a hard political decision.&quot; Mr. Gillick said America West remains ready to re-examine its opposition if USAir becomes willing to discuss the sale of slots at Washington National and LaGuardia.    USAir's Mr. Hydeman said Judge Yoder's concerns about competition are &quot;absolutely utter nonsense.&quot; He said that Washington-based USAir and Winston-Salem, N.C.-based Piedmont operate only three overlapping routes: Syracuse, N.Y., to Washington National; Syracuse to LaGuardia; and Rochester, N.Y., to LaGuardia.    Mr. Hydeman also said that Judge Yoder sought to hold USAir to a stricter standard than other airlines have been subjected to in recent merger cases. The judge's opinion, he said, &quot;is really a form of effort to re-regulate the airline industry.&quot;    The Transportation Department has approved 19 previous airline acquisitions, including those that gave Trans World Airlines Inc. dominance at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport and allowed NWA Inc.'s Northwest Airlines unit to dominate airports in Minneapolis, Memphis, Tenn., and Detroit. </TEXT></DOC>
