The proposed rule would make companies face up to reality bylisting the future cost of retirees' medical benefits as a liabilityon their books.   Rough estimates of the new liabilities range from $400 billion to$2 trillion for all U.S. companies.   ``It's not the concept that's the problem so much as as theimplementation,'' Solomon Samson, a Standard andamp; Poor's managingdirector, said in an interview. ``You may be doing yourself more ofa disservice, even though the objective is very noble.''   Samson said Standard andamp; Poor's would stick to its own method ofestimating how retirees' medical expenses would affectcreditworthiness.   Companies that promised generous medical benefits to employeesupon retirement are seeking changes in the accounting proposal,which would force firms to slash their reported profits by billionsof dollars.   Standard andamp; Poor's criticism, which first surfaced in a WallStreet Journal story Tuesday, was the severest yet in the ongoingdebate.   Officials at Ford Motor Co. and American Telephone andamp; TelegraphCo. said Tuesday in phone interviews that they support the change inprinciple, while believing it is too stringent as proposed.   Listing future medical benefits as a liability will sting allcompanies, but especially ones that gave their employees betterretirement medical benefits because it seemed cheaper in the shortrun than paying higher wages and salaries.   Hardest hit will be smokestack industries such as automakers andsteelmakers that have generous benefits packages and growing ranksof retirees, combined with slow growth or no growth in revenue.   The benefits issue is much like the national debate over SocialSecurity and how to account for the cost of supporting the baby boomgeneration when it reaches retirement.   The Financial Accounting Standards Board, the chief rule-makingbody for accountants, is taking companies' suggestions into accountand probably will relax the rule somewhat before adoption, TimothyLucas, research director of the Norwalk, Conn.-based organization,said Tuesday.   By accounting rules, whenever companies add a new liability for afuture expense, they have to reduce their reported profits by anequal amount. If the charge were taken all at once or over a shortperiod, it could turn a profit into a large reported loss, alarmingshareholders.   ``This liability was built up over past years and under priormanagement teams, and some people have the feeling that, `Why doesthis have to happen on my watch?''' Lucas said.   Still, Standard andamp; Poor's reported criticism was ``very unusual,''since most other companies have at least supported the concept ofthe change, he said.   Moody's Investors Service, the main rival to Standard andamp; Poor's,said the proposed rule would help rating agencies by providing themwith more complete information about companies' liabilities.   ``We feel that it is a positive to both rating agencies andinvestors. The logic of accruing a future liability has validity,''said Harold Goldberg, a Moody's senior vice president.   The debate over accounting rules does not even touch on an evenbigger issue, which is whether companies should set up funds forretirees' medical benefits the same way they set up pension funds.Tax laws discourage such funds because money put into them can't bededucted from corporate income taxes the way pension contributionscan.   The proposed accounting standard would go into effect in 1992 andcompanies would have 15 years to bring their books into line withtheir actual liabilities.   Companies have proposed several ways to ease the blow. One is tostretch the catch-up period to 20, 30 or even 40 years. Another isto let companies account for liabilities that have already beenincurred by going back and restating earnings for prior yearsinstead of taking the full blow in current and future earningsstatements.   An alternative would be to add to liabilities without taking acorresponding hit on the profit-and-loss statement _ an unusual andcontroversial approach.   Some companies, including Ford, want leeway to assume that theywill be able to reduce inflation in medical benefits costs belowhistorical levels _ something not permitted under the proposedstandard.   Finally, some companies have proposed easing the blow by makingthe assumption that employees will not retire until they reachmandatory retirement age. That would allow more years to accumulatethe reserve and assume fewer years of payouts.</TEXT></DOC>
