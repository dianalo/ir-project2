At present, both HBO and its sister service, Cinemax, areavailable to cable subscribers on a single channel each. Butunder the new plan, each network will air different moviesand specials simultaneously on three different channels. At10 p.m., for example, HBO's three channels might offerviewers a choice of &quot;HBO Comedy Hour: Rodney Dangerfield,&quot;&quot;My Left Foot&quot; and &quot;Young Guns II.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   HBO, a unit of Time Warner Inc, will test its plan inTeleCable Corp.'s cable systems in Overland Park, Kan., andPlano, Texas, beginning Aug. 1. A third test will begin at alater date in Racine, Wis.   Michael Fuchs, HBO's chairman and chief executive officer,said the plan has been enthusiastically received by manycable operators and suggested the company could roll out the&quot;multiplex&quot; delivery system nationally by late 1992.   Although there is currently a shortage of extra channelson most cable systems, HBO said new developments -- usingcompression techniques and fiber optics -- will allow cableoperators to sharply expand capacity. The new system &quot;isbuilt for an explosion of channels,&quot; Mr. Fuchs said.   Mr. Fuchs and other HBO executives said they decided toswitch to a multichannel format to better satisfy consumersand the nation's cable operators, who have been pressing for&quot;value-added&quot; pay TV services and so-called pay-per-viewchannels, which allow consumers to order a single movie orevent. HBO said it doesn't plan to use any of the addedchannels as a pay-per-view service.   HBO and Cinemax won't be offering any more programmingthan they currently air; each network will simply be offeringthree different schedules of programming. Thus, HBO says,consumers will be able to view its pay services according totheir own schedules and be less likely to cancel. The priceof the pay services to consumers, at least at first, wouldn'tchange.   Retention of existing subscribers is a major factoraffecting HBO's revenue. Its disconnect rate is just over 4%a month, or about 850,000 of its more than 17 millioncustomers annually. The company predicted that it would beable to lower total disconnects by 10% with multiplexdelivery. At that rate, the company would be able to achievea revenue savings for its HBO network alone of about $45.9million a year.   &quot;Even a little shift in retention represents anextraordinary number of subscribers,&quot; Mr. Fuchs said. &quot;It hasreal financial implications.&quot;   If consumers embrace HBO's multiplex system, the cableindustry would likely benefit, too, because a big chunk ofthe earnings operators receive comes from HBO. HBO said thatbased on its estimate of a 10% decline in disconnect rates,the industry could achieve as much as $200 million annuallyin increased net profits. That money would come from theresultant higher subscription levels and lower transactioncosts.   Executives at HBO's main rival, Viacom Inc.'s Showtimenetwork, said they will study HBO's plan and closely monitorthe test. &quot;I think that this is a nice response by HBO to the{restructured service} that Showtime initiated over a yearago,&quot; said Winston Cox, Showtime's chairman and chiefexecutive officer. &quot;We applaud it.&quot;   Showtime recently introduced a plan called TOPS thatroughly halves the cost of Showtime, but forces cableoperators to increase the number of subscriptions sharply.That plan was developed in response to growing consumerconcern that the pay services aren't worth their price tagsanymore, Mr. Cox said.   Mr. Cox said Showtime has considered the multiplex system,but has questions as to whether subscribers will perceivethem as having more value. &quot;We have some ideas that I thinkgo even beyond HBO's announcement that we'll be addressingvery shortly.&quot; He wouldn't comment further.   Robert Stengel, senior vice president at ContinentalCablevision Inc. in Boston, responded favorably to the newsystem. &quot;Anything that increases the subscribers' valueperception of pay TV without increasing the cost to theconsumer or to the operator is worth trying,&quot; he said. But headded that he was doubtful that HBO could roll out the systemby next year. &quot;We're interested in talking to them abouttesting it, maybe in a system or two,&quot; he said. &quot;But on awidespread basis, that's a midterm proposition&quot; that won't bein place for three to five years, he predicted.   Mr. Fuchs said HBO is testing its new system primarily totry out various programming options and to develop themarketing campaigns that will be used when it is offerednationally.   Mr. Fuchs said he plans to keep the rest of the cableindustry informed of progress in the test markets. &quot;If thecable industry sees where {the system} is working, then Ithink it's really going to be a hard thing for them toresist,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
