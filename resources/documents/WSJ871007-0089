The officials cautioned, however, that some major issues still need to be resolved, and that snags could still drag out the process or cause a breakdown in talks. But many said they now hope for an agreement by the end of the week.    &quot;We are making significant progress, although we aren't bargaining against a schedule,&quot; a GM spokesman said late yesterday afteroon. He declined to comment on the timing or on what specific progress had been made.    Meanwhile, the UAW called a meeting for Monday of GM local union leaders from around the country. Invitations said the meetings, which are held every contract year, would be used either to ratify a tentative agreement or simply to get an update on the status of the talks.    A deadline to reach a new contract hasn't been set yet, and UAW President Owen Bieber said earlier this week he may not set one if the negotiations continue to progress.    Many officials are optimistic that a GM strike, once considered inevitable, can be avoided. But the positive signs don't necessarily mean the threat of a strike has evaporated. The dynamics of bargaining can often overtake a consensus on major issues, and strikes can sometimes result if either side simply misses signals sent by the other.    In 1984, for example, negotiators for both GM and the UAW said they were certain up to the last minute that they could reach agreement without a walkout. Still, the talks broke down into a week-long work stoppage.    In addition, the pact accepted by the UAW leadership will require ratification by the rank and file. Depending on the terms agreed to, that could prove difficult. The UAW says it wants a contract patterned after the one reached at Ford Motor Co. last month. If the union gets that, ratification should prove easy. Ford workers approved their contract by a three-to-one margin.    GM says it will accept the Ford framework, but it wants some differences. Substantial deviation would make it harder to sell the contract to the membership.    Ford agreed to a $500 million job security program that protects workers against layoff during the life of the contract, except during a sales drop. It also bans plant closings and guarantees replacement of half the workers lost through attrition.    The contract also gives all workers a 3% base-wage raise in the first year of the pact, and 3% lump-sum payments in the last two years.    In return, the UAW agreed to encourage work-rule changes at each factory.    GM, which is less efficient than Ford, has said it has problems with the attrition limit and the ban on plant closings. It has also asked for separate provisions for its parts operations, which it says are uncompetitive.    It wasn't clear late yesterday whether the UAW had agreed to those changes, or whether GM had dropped any of these demands. Some GM officials, noting the UAW's history of pattern bargaining, are pessimistic about winning a contract tailored to GM. </TEXT></DOC>
