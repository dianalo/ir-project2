Roberto Hoyo D'Addona, the country's fiscal attorney general, wasquoted as saying his department has received 50 complaints ofalleged stockbreaker fraud stemming from the crash.   Investigations in five of those complaints turned up no evidenceof wrongdoing, he was quoted as saying by Mexico City newspapers.   He said investigations by the Department of Treasury were beingcarried out ``without regard to the political or economic power ofthose involved.''   ``There exist accusations against all of the brokerage firmsexcept one. The Treasury Department is only investigating if theNational Securities Law has been violated in order to tell the(attorney general) whether or not crimes exist to prosecute,''D'Addona said.   He did not identify possible securities violations but said theinvestigations were related to the October 1987 crash, when Mexico'smarket index plunged by 74 percent in 28 trading days.   The Treasury Department is to complete its investigations withinweeks, D'Addona said.   Attorney General Enrique Alvarez del Castillo said his departmentwould begin legal proceedings when asked to do so by the TreasuryDepartment or the National Securities Commission.   ``These are the instructions of the president,'' he said inremarks published Friday.   A congressional panel on Wednesday voted to call D'Addona, DeputyAttorney General Luis Porte Petit and Oscar Espinosa Villareal,president of the securities commission, to testify about the fraudallegations.   The request went to the Chamber of Deputies' Treasury Committee.Hearings are expected to begin next week.</TEXT></DOC>
