 I know we canestablish another print server, but that takes the resources of another PC.andO;Isn't there any way to extend the parallel printer cable more than 15 or 20feet?andM;Bruce Whitmore Los Angeles, CaliforniaandM;The limitation on parallel printer cable length frustrates many LAN planners.andO;However, several companies sell parallel cable extension devices.andP;  Black Box(412-746-5530) offers its Parallel Extender II, whic provides a 1,000-foottelephone-wire connection between a print server and a printer, for $275each--you need one at each end.andM;However, note that such devices convert parallel signals to serial and thenback to parallel again, using simple circuitry.andP;  Speed has always been theadvantage of the parallel cabling, and slowness the disadvantage of a serialalternative.andP;  As devices like this convert the parallel river of data to aserial stream, the print server waits and print jobs back up.andP;  While theprint server waits, some of its CPU power is spent managing the print queuerather than processing requests for disk access.andP;  You'll only be happy withcable extension products that do pure hardware conversion ofserial-to-parallel signaling if you have a light printing load.andM;A more robust alternative comes from Protec MicroSystems (514-631-2811).andP;  ItsXtendplus is a microprocessor-controlled device that can contain up to 4megabytes of print-job storage.andP;  It also converts the parallel signals toserial, drives them over as much as 8,000 feet of telephone wire, and thenconverts them back again, so the output isn't as fast as a parallel cableconnection, but the built-in buffer helps to unload the print server faster.andO;The Xtendplus carries an $890 price tag, and you still need two of them, butthey'll let you move a printer over a mile away without bogging down yourprint server.andM;CHOOSING A NETWORKandM;TOPOLOGYandM;I'm about to become the administrator of a LAN utilizing Token-Ring wiring.andO;The purchasing decision for our network was made before my involvement.andP;  Iget the impression that you strongly prefer both Ethernet and ARCnet overToken-Ring.andP;  If so, why?andM;Layne Ricketts Blacksburg, VirginiaandM;If you've got Token-Ring now, my advice is this: learn to love it.andP;  Theexpense of the Token-Ring wiring and equipment is one of my major complaints.andO;I caution against using unshielded twisted-pair wiring on Token-Ring, becauseI think it eventually falls prey to poor signal quality, and the effect ofthis accumulates more on Token-Ring than it does on Ethernet or ARCnet.andM;Certainly, once the industry gets the chip and software problems straightenedout, the 16-megabit-per-second Token-Ring should work very well onenterprisewide networks with many hundreds of nodes.andP;  You can't argue withthe concept of a network using an orderly token access scheme with16-megabit-per-second signaling for heavy-duty work, but you may well ask,&quot;Does our organization really need all this?&quot;andP;  I can't see any good reasonfor installing 4-megabit-per-second Token-Ring at this time.andM;Since you've already inherited a Token-Ring network, I advise you to go tothe wiring closets and look at your Token-Ring wiring hubs or, as IBM callsthem, Multistation Access Units (MAUs).andP;  If your MAUs don't include acapability for remote activity monitoring and the ability to disconnect anode remotely, put some money in the budget for replacements.andP;  Proteon,Thomas-Conrad, and other companies offer Token-Ring wiring systems withremote monitoring and management capabilities.andM;Anyone who hasn't yet chosen a network topology and who doesn't need therobust capability of 16-megabit-per-second Token-Ring should consider themany wiring options available under the IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet) specifications.andO;Companies such as SynOptics can certainly make you happy with the coaxial,twisted-pair, and fiber cable wiring combinations they offer.andM;However, our LAN Labs testing has discovered that top-flight servers withvery fast hard disk arrays and operating systems like NetWare 386 and LANManager 2.0 can deliver more data than a single Ethernet cable can carryaway.andP;  The simple answere is to use two, three, four, or more adapters in theserver with separate cable runs for each adapter.andM;ARCnet, despite its 2.5-megabit-per-second signaling scheme, is still afavorite of ours.andP;  You can't really find fault with something that's simpleto install and works well.andP;  Competition has reduced the price of ARCnetadapters to under $100, and you still have twisted-pair, fiber, and coaxialcable options.andP;  To enhance performance for heavily populated networks, thesolution is, again, to use multiple adapters in the servers.andM;The bottom line is this: if you have a network of fewer than 200 users andthose users run common office applications, then select from among ARCnet andEthnert options on the basis of price and the amount of trust you have in theinstaller.andP;  If you have a large network environment where people move lots ofdata, including, for instance, files of graphic images, then add 16megabit-per-second Token-Ring to your option list.andM;PROGRAMMING A PBXandM;I know that our PBX telephone system has a microcomputer at its heart.andP;  Whena repairman opened the cabinet, I saw what appeared to be a PC AT clonesitting in a rack.andP;  Can we program this PC to add new features to ourtelephones?andM;Muriel Fullam New York, New YorkandM;Organizations consisting of more than three or four people usually have oneof three types of phone systems: a key system (every phone has a row ofbuttons along the bottom), Centrex (the service comes from the telephonecompany's local office), or a Private Branch Exchange (PBX).andP;  You'll usuallysee a PBX as a cabinet in a dark closet full of telephone wires.andM;A CPU of some kind, usually an Intel 80286 or 80386, drives every modern PBX.andO;Some have multiple processors.andP;  However, practically none of these CPUs runDOS and only a few run something close to Unix.andP;  Until late 1989, there wasno way the owner or lessee of a PBX could get at the CPU's processing powerto customize its operation.andM;However, in 1989 the industry began opening windows into PBX programming andinteraction through the introduction of the Open Application Interface (OAI).andO;This interface gives programmers a standard way to send detailed instructionsto and receive responses from the processor(s) in a PBX.andP;  Some PBX companies,like Northern Telecom and ATandamp;T, have developed partnerships in the computerindustry with such companies as Digital Equipment Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co.,andO;and IBM Corp. in order to implement software that meets the OAI standards.andO;Other PBX companies, such as InteCom, NEC, and Henriksen Data Systems, offerVAR toolkits and are openly working with software developers.andM;Being able to customize your PBX is an interesting option, but the real valueof OAI lies in the potential interaction of the relatively low-powerprocessors in the PBX with the processing power that is available on a LAN.andO;Computers on the LAN can work with the PBX to route and reply to calls, storemillions of numbers, track calls, and provide special services for eachtelephone user.andM;If you can think of great applications for the PBX-to-LAN link, you'll beinterest in a document called the Open Application Interface Special Report.andO;It sells for $279 from the Telecom Library (800-LIBRARY).andP;  This is a hot areafor creative software developers.andM;FORGING A NEW LINKandM;At the Spring Comdex 1990, the PC LAN Labs sponsored a meeting of companiesinvolved in the multiuser DOS business.andP;  We felt that the companies in thisinteresting market segment needed to quit sparring with each other and begincooperating enough to set some standards for interoperability.andP;  We used theneutral PC LAN Labs banner as a backdrop for this meeting of companies, whichare usually highly competitive.andM;If you aren't familiar with multiuser DOS products, you might be missing avaluable alternative to a more expensive media-shared LAN.andP;  These productsinclude operating systems such as VM/386 MultiUser, PC-MOS/386, ConcurrentDOS 386, 386/Multiware, Quick Connect/386, and THEOS DOS as well as a varietyof monochrome and color monitors.andP;  (See (See &quot;Building Workgroup Solutions:Multiuser Graphics Terminal&quot; in the August 1990 issue of PC Magazine for moreon these alternatives.)andP;  Together, these software and hardware products willlet you share the power of a single 386 or 486 PC among as many as five userswhile continuing to run the familiar DOS programs you probably alreadyown--including CAD, database, accounting, and almost all standard PCapplications.andM;Multiuser DOS systems offer some important advantages, such as a very lowcost per use and good security.andP;  But the companies selling these products usedifferent addressing schemes for multiport RS-232C adapters, different callsfor network services, and different methods of implementing graphics.andP;  Thesedifferences don't make one product beeter than any other, all they do is fillpotential buyers and application devlopers with a great deal of confusion andconcern.andM;The meeting we sponsored at Comdex was a success, and the Multiuser DOSFederation is the result.andP;  The primary goals of this Federation are to setstandards for multiuser systems using DOS applications and to help peopleunderstand the value of this LAN alternative.andP;  If you'd like more informationon the Federation and its activities, contact The Software Link at (404)448-5465.andM;NETWORK YOUR QUESTIONSandM;Connectivity gives practical solutions to networking problems of all types.andO;We'll pay $50 for any tips we print.andP;
