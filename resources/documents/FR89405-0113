DPR-80 and DPR-82,issued to Pacific Gas and Electric Company (the licensee), for operationof the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant, Units Nos. 1 and 2, located inSan Luis Obispo County, California.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Assessment</ITAG><T3>Identification of Proposed Action</T3>The proposed amendments would revise the combined Technical Specifications(TS) to permit the use of Vantage 5 fuel in the facility.The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application foramendments dated November 29, 1988, as supplemented by submittals filedon December 9, 1988 and February 17, 1989 (Reference LAR 88-08).<T3>The Need for the Proposed Action</T3>The proposed amendments are needed so that the licensee can use the improvedfuel design for longer fuel cycles, which may involve the use of higherenrichment fuel and extended fuel irradiation.<T3>Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action</T3>The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed revisions tothe TS. The proposed revisions would permit the fuel to be irradiated tolevels above 33 gigawatt days per metric ton (GWD/MT), but not to exceed60 GWD/MT. The safety considerations associated with reactor operationwith higher enrichment and extended irradiation have been evaluated bythe NRC staff. The staff has concluded that such changes would not adverselyaffect plant safety. The proposed changes have no effect on the probabilityof any accident. The increased burnup may slightly change the mix or fissionproducts that might be released in the event of a serious accident, butsuch small changes would not significantly affect the consequences of seriousaccidents. No changes are being made in the types or amounts of any radiologicaleffluents that may be released offsite. There is no significant increasein the allowable individual or cumulative occupational radiation exposure.With regard to potential nonradiological impacts of reactor operation withhigher enrichment and extended irradiation, the proposed changes to theTS involve systems located within the restricted area, as defined in 10CFR Part 20. They do not affect nonradiological plant effluents and haveno other environmental impact.The environmental impacts of transportation resulting from the use of higherenrichment fuel and extended irradiation are discussed in the NRC staff'sassessment entitled ``NRC Assessment of the Environmental Effects of TransportationResulting from Extended Fuel Enrichment and Irradiation,'' dated July 7,1988. This assessment was published in the August 11, 1988 <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 30355) as part of the Carolina Power andamp;Light Co., et al., Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1, EnvironmentalImpact Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact for the utilizationof higher enriched fuel and extended fuel irradiation and is hereby referencedfor this Environmental Impact Assessment and Finding of No SignificantImpact. As indicated therein, the environmental cost contributions of theproposed increase in the fuel enrichment and irradiation limits will eithercause no change in, or may, in fact, reduce the environmental cost contributionssummarized in Table S-4, as set forth in 10 CFR 51.52(c). Therefore, theCommission concludes that there are no significant radiological or non-radiologicalenvironmental impacts associated with the proposed amendments.<T3>Alternative to the Proposed Action</T3>Since the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmentaleffects that would result from the proposed action, any alternatives wouldhave equal or greater environmental impacts.The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendments. Thiswould not reduce environmental impacts of plant operation and would resultin reduced operational flexibility.Alternative Use of ResourcesThis action does not involve the use of any resources not previously consideredin the Final Environmental Statement related to the Diablo Canyon NuclearPower Plant dated May 1973, and its Addendum, dated May 1976.Agencies and Persons ConsultedThe Commission's staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consultother agencies or persons.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed license amendments. Based upon the foregoing environmentalassessment, we conclude that the proposed action will not have a significanteffect on the quality of the human environment.For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendments dated November 29, 1988, and the supplemental submittals datedDecember 9, 1988 and February 17, 1989, which are available for publicinspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW.,Washington, DC 20555, and at the California Polytechnic State UniversityLibrary, Government Documents and Maps Department, San Luis Obispo, California93407.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 25th day of April 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">George W.
