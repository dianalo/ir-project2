The usually bustling tourist spots are not a pretty sight thesedays. Along the barren walkways from Pier 39 to Ghirardelli Square,tourists are few, attractions are empty and T-shirt vendors sitforlornly next to their stands.   It's so deserted that street parking is easy, an unheard ofproposition in normal times.   ``The tourists who were here before the earthquake have left andhaven't come back,'' says Narcis Carranza, leaning next to hissweater stand by Pier 41. ``I haven't sold anything.''   He says he's suffered a 90 percent drop in business since lastweek's quake.   As for San Francisco Bay cruises, even a sunny day with viewsall the way to Angel Island can't lure the few tourists remaining.   The Blue andamp; Gold Fleet's 400-passenger sightseeing boats makeonly two daily trips, compared to the usual nine, these daysbecause of sparse business, says Katie Thorsen.   On a typical day, she sells 400-600 $12 tickets. She sold 56tickets Wednesday and wasn't looking to fare any better Thursday.   ``I think people are going to start coming back,'' she says. ``Ithink if you give them a couple of weeks.''   Hotel operators, many of whom have seen their rooms emptied andreservations canceled, hope that's correct.   ``Business is down. I think it's all hotels in the city, everybusiness in the city,'' says Fil Da Cunha, assistant generalmanager of the Holiday Inn at Fisherman's Wharf.   Most of the 580 rooms at the Holiday Inn were filled when the7.1 magnitude quake rumbled through Northern California, but theoccupancy rate has dropped to about 25 percent now, he said.   Da Cunha, with bitterness in his voice, partially blames thenews media for what he calls an obsession with the damaged areas inSan Francisco's Marina District, the Bay Bridge and Interstate 880.   ``They haven't showed all the buildings standing up, yet,'' hesays.   At The Wharf Inn, business has dropped dramatically andoccupancy stands at about 27 percent, says Suzanne Reese, generalmanager of the 51-room hotel on Mason Street, near the waterfront.   ``I think it will affect our business for quite a while. We'vehad a lot of cancellations,'' says Reese.   Though there was damage to some tourist areas and other parts ofSan Francisco, it wasn't devastating. The city is not flattened,something officials are trying to pass on to people planning avisit here.   Phone calls to the San Francisco Convention and Visitors Bureauare met with a taped message that begins, ``The city is returningto normal...''   After the quake, the bureau's eight-person sales staff jumped onthe phones and called convention and meeting planners to assurethem the city was intact and that ``we were open for business,''says Sharon Rooney, public relations manager.   They also called travel publications to let them know that mostbusinesses in San Francisco were not damaged. The bureau enlistedMayor Art Agnos to write a letter this week telling meetingplanners the city was safe.   In San Francisco, where tourism is the No. 1 industry _ worth$3.4 billion _ only two major meetings were canceled, says Rooney.Nissan had been expected Thursday, while the League of CaliforniaCities also canceled its Oct. 21 convention. The city lost at least6,000 delegates from the two cancellations.   In Oakland, the tourism industry was initially hurt after thequake but has bounced back almost to normal, according to LindaHowell of the Oakland Convention and Visitor Bureau.   Where hotel occupancy at one point fell to 25 percent inOakland, the rate has increased to about 80 percent, she said. But,as Howell notes, San Francisco has about eight times morefirst-class hotel rooms than Oakland.   ``They have a larger stake there,'' she says. ``They're going tobe hurt more.''   Most tourists fled after the Oct. 17 quake, but some stayed.There are even a few who arrived after the temblor.   ``A lot of people have asked us, `How come you came _ you're sobrave,''' says Audrey Malling, who along with her husband, Gerald,arrived in San Francisco two nights after the quake fromGreenville, Mich.   The elderly couple, leaning against a pier with a clear,breathtaking view of Alacatraz, say they really didn't think ofchanging their longstanding plans to visit their son, Paul.   ``It's kind of nice for us, cause we don't worry about gettinginto things,'' quips Gerald Malling, an attorney.   John Marshall and his wife, Ilona, of Beden, West Germany,arrived in San Francisco on Wednesday. They were at Disneyland whenthe quake hit.   The Marshalls, sitting in a courtyard in the Hyde Street Pier,across the street from The Cannery shopping center, say they'vebeen through earthquakes before.   ``So we are not afraid of the earthquake,'' says John Marshall.``Everyone has to die and if you are in the wrong place, you havethe bad luck.''</TEXT></DOC>
