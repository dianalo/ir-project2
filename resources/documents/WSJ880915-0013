A CAE spokesman said in Toronto that the contract is worth 55 million Canadian dollars (U.S.$45 million), but added that the total value could exceed C$72 million if the Army exercises an option to order a combat mission simulator for a second helicopter, the MH-60K.    CAE bought Link and three other military simulation and training companies from Singer Co. last month in order to enter the military simulation market. Link has designed and built other flight simulators for the Army.    The spokesman said more contracts with the U.S. military are under negotiation. </TEXT></DOC>
