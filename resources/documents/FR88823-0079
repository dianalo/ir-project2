This amendment consists of a proposed change to Technical SpecificationSection 4.8.2.1 concerning emergency DC battery loads. During the reviewof a plant modification, the licensees determined that the emergency DCbattery loads had changed. As a result, changes were made to the low poweroperating license Technical Specifications in order to reflect the revisedloading. Based upon subsequent review by the licensees, it has been determinedthat a Division II load (Fire Protection distribution panel) had not originallybeen taken into account. Thus a change to Specification 4.8.2.1.d.2.b wasrequired in order to accurately reflect the 4-hour Division II batteryemergency loading profile.
