ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Crude prices topped $40 a barrel for the firsttime despite President Bush's attempt to soothe oil markets byselling government reserves.   Analysts said heightened tension Thursday in the Persian Gulfhelped counter Bush's decision to sell 5 million barrels of crudefrom the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.   The November contract traded Thursday for light, sweet cruderose 87 cents to settle at $39.54 a barrel on the New YorkMercantile Exchange after trading as high as $40.10.   It was the first time oil prices on the futures exchange passedthe $40-a-barrel mark. Each barrel holds 42 gallons.   In early trading this morning, oil prices were narrowly lower.The November contract for light, sweet crude was off 29 cents at$39.25 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange by midmorning.   Bush said Wednesday that he was dipping into the nation'sreserves of 590 million barrels to counter speculators who havedriven up the price of crude despite adequate supplies. Prices havedoubled since the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.   The president succeeded only temporarily. Prices dropped onoverseas markets Thursday, and crude opened at $37.67 a barrel inNew York. But Persian Gulf developments prompted panic buying.   William Byers, an oil market analyst with Bear, Stearns andamp; Co.,called news from the Middle East ``more than an offsettingpenalty'' to Bush's announcement.   He also said many traders viewed Thursday's incident involvingthe Iraqi tanker Tadmur as an offensive measure by the Baghdadgovernment, designed to increase tensions in the Gulf.   The Pentagon said a team from a U.S. warship in the Red Seaboarded the tanker after firing warning shots when orders to stopwere ignored. The Tadmur was allowed to proceed after it was foundto be empty, the Pentagon said.   Analysts said the market continued to be hypersensitive to anyrumors or reports that indicate military action is brewing thatcould cut off output from Saudi Arabia, the biggest producer in theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.   There also was some skepticism in the market about whether Bushis serious about holding down oil prices by dipping into thenation's reserves.   ``It may be more an attempt to show the electorate five weeksbefore the elections that he's trying to do something and isconcerned,'' said Peter Beutel, an oil market analyst at PegasusEconometric Group Inc. in Hoboken, N.J.   But Beutel said sales from the nation's reserves may yet have animpact on the market.   ``Over time, as people start to lose interest in pursuing thebear market to an end, it could be a moderating influence onprices,'' he said.   Meanwhile, prices for refined products also continued to climbThursday.   Home heating oil for delivering in October rose 1.80 cents to$1.0437 a gallon and prices for wholesale unleaded regular gasolinejumped 2.59 cents to $1.0269 a gallon.   The change in seasons is also a factor in heating oil prices,however. Prices always advance as colder weather approaches.</TEXT></DOC>
