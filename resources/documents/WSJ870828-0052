The bid was made by a group including certain members of management and TXL Corp., a San Francisco investment concern. It is conditioned on, among other things, agreements with certain Arnox debtholders and major shareholders.    Greenwich, Conn.-based Arnox, which makes fire-retardant chemicals, said it expects a report from the committee within three weeks.    In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Arnox shares were quoted at $8.75 bid. </TEXT></DOC>
