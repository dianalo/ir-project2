Col. Oliver North recently told the congressional Iran-Contra committee, &quot;that the president is still charged with the responsibility for the conduct of foreign policy in this country.&quot;    But the Constitution, often cited righteously as the basis for the president's responsibility, is far from clear on where foreign policy and military authority rest -- indeed, it doesn't even mention the words &quot;foreign affairs.&quot; The result has been a struggle for power between presidents and Congress that began soon after the Constitutional Convention. And in this, the bicentennial year, that struggle continues with the president contending Congress is trying to deny him his foreign-policy authority, and Congress charging it has been shut out of the process.    When it comes to foreign policy, the Constitution &quot;is a very mixed bag,&quot; says Gerhard Casper, a University of Chicago Law School professor. &quot;It's a very complex system of shared responsibilities, and both Congress and the executive have failed for some decades to see that these matters get coordinated in a lowkey way.&quot;    History offers little support for Col. North's argument that the president alone conducts foreign policy. In the 1800s, &quot;we recognized that Congress had a constitutional stake in foreign affairs,&quot; says Louis Fisher, a Library of Congress constitutional expert. &quot;The whole notion of the president being the dominant person in foreign affairs, if not having a monopoly, is a recent idea.&quot;    The Constitution leaves open many questions about foreign and military policy. But it does provide that the president is commander in chief, receives foreign emissaries and, with Congress's approval, appoints ambassadors and makes treaties. Congress declares war, provides for the common defense, regulates foreign commerce, and maintains and makes rules for an army and a navy.    The current battle over the Boland amendment, a provision in recent appropriations bills restricting U.S. military aid for the Contra rebels in Nicaragua, is only the latest example of the unclear lines of authority.    For much of the past 200 years there have been similar fights. Congress has historically tried to hold onto the powers it has under the Constitution, and in recent years has tried more to assert them. Presidents have gradually added to their authority by acting first, particularly in military matters, and informing Congress later, often leaving Congress no choice but to approve the action.    Congress must bear much of the blame for the changing balance of power. &quot;Congress contributed to the steady growth of presidential power,&quot; writes Louis Henkin, a Columbia University Law School professor who believes that the constitutional role of Congress has been eroded. &quot;Congress early recognized and confirmed the president's control of daily foreign intercourse, and the resulting monopoly of information and experience promoted the president's claim of expertise and Congress's sense of inadequacy.&quot;    There are many examples of how the system has worked with little congressional input. President Woodrow Wilson sent U.S. troops into Mexico in 1916 in search of outlaw leader Pancho Villa without asking for approval by Congress. Congress later passed a resolution approving the action. The Korean and Vietnam wars were never officially declared by Congress. Both were subsequently funded by Congress, of course, and backed by congressional resolutions.    More recently, when U.S. Marines and Army Rangers invaded Grenada in October 1983, Congress wasn't consulted and was only formally advised by President Reagan after the troops landed. In 1979, in an example that didn't involve military action, President Carter terminated a treaty with Taiwan without seeking approval from Congress.    The erosion of Congress's role led, in 1973, to passage of the War Powers Act, which requires presidents to consult with and report military involvements to Congress and which sets limits on the length of military actions without congressional approval. But presidents have disputed the constitutionality of the law and have complied only with the reporting requirement.    Of course, some constitutional experts think Congress shouldn't be more deeply involved. Yale Law School Professor Eugene Rostow, a former undersecretary of state, says he believes in &quot;shared power&quot; but adds, &quot;Congress should stick to the broad lines of foreign policy and not get into micromanagement.&quot;    In the past 50 years, some historians say, presidential authority on foreign affairs has increased substantially. One reason is a 1936 Supreme Court ruling in U.S. vs. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp. In the majority opinion, Justice George Sutherland wrote at length of &quot;the exclusive power of the president&quot; in foreign relations. He said this authority couldn't be restricted by Congress because it came not from the Constitution, but from the inherent power of a sovereign government.    Ironically, this strong defense of the executive was extraneous to the ruling, in which the high court upheld Congress's decision authorizing the president to prohibit arms sales to South American countries. Nevertheless, the ruling is often relied upon and cited by White House advisers, including Col. North in his recent Iran-Contra testimony. And while it is criticized by some constitutional experts, it has never been overruled by the high court.    In the current fight over the Iran-Contra operation, White House aides rely in part on this broad, inherent power to argue that the aid restrictions passed by Congress didn't -- indeed, couldn't -- apply to the president or his staff, including the National Security Council.    Many constitutional experts disagree. Chicago's Professor Casper argues that &quot;The framers would have agreed that Congress can restrict spending in Nicaragua.&quot; And Columbia's Professor Henkin adds: &quot;Congress can also tell the president not to go getting private aid for the Contras.&quot;    Congress would probably exceed its authority if it tried to bar the president from discussing Contra aid with foreign governments. That, says Professor Rostow, &quot;is getting awfully close to the boundary, if not stepping over it.&quot;    The fight over division of power bears little resemblance to the Constitutional Convention, where delegates were more concerned with whether the states should have any foreign-policy role and whether to maintain a military force in times of peace. In one of the few debates about which branch should have the power, the convention voted on Aug. 17, 1787, to change the power of Congress from &quot;to make war&quot; to &quot;to declare war.&quot; This, James Madison of Virginia and Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts said, would leave &quot;to the executive the power to repel sudden attacks.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
