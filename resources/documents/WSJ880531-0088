The Federal Reserve's recent credit-tightening likely won't be its last this year as the seemingly robust U.S. economy creates pressure for higher inflation, they add. And while the dollar could remain relatively stable in the months ahead, its stability continues to be underpinned by larger rate increases here than abroad.    &quot;When exchange rates are fixed, as they (effectively) have been for the dollar by central banks, it's easier to transmit inflationary impulses from one country to another,&quot; says Michael R. Rosenberg, manager of the international fixed-income research department at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. &quot;Now that inflation is a big concern in the U.S., this fear is being transmitted to Europe and Japan. That means the bear market in U.S. bonds easily can be exported overseas.&quot;    For U.S. investors, the trend would make almost all dollar-denominated debt securities the worst performing fixed-income investments among the world's major markets and put Australian and Canadian dollar as well as French franc securities among the best, Mr. Rosenberg contends. These alternative markets already provide unusually high nominal and inflation-adjusted yields compared with U.S. debt instruments.    Nicholas Sargen, a director of international bond market research at Salomon Brothers Inc., agrees. &quot;In 1985 and 1986, the reason for investing in non-dollar bonds was the strength of (foreign) currencies,&quot; he says. &quot;This year, the reason is that U.S. rates are rising faster and further&quot; than rates overseas.    For bond investors, &quot;1988 will be a year of relative performance, not absolute performance,&quot; says Mr. Rosenberg. &quot;The relative performance of non-dollar bonds will be superior to the performance of dollar securities, although the absolute returns probably won't look as impressive as the returns generated in 1985, 1986 or 1987.&quot;    For instance, the dollar declined 9%, 21% and 18%, respectively, against the mark during the past three years. So far in 1988, the U.S. currency has appreciated about 5% against the mark. Thus, while dollar-based investors received a total return of more than 25% by owning German government bonds last year, most of that gain was from the mark's appreciation against the dollar.    In contrast, a dollar investment in West German bonds, with the currency hedged, currently would provide an annual yield of about 10.70% compared with a yield of about 9.30% on a long-term U.S. government bond. Many dollar-based investors hedge their foreign exchange risk by buying German bonds and simultaneously selling marks for settlement at a substantial premium three months later.    So far this year, the rise in U.S. rates has outstripped increases abroad. While yields on long-term U.S. bonds climbed about 1.15 percentage points since February, they rose only 0.4 point and 0.45 point, respectively, in the Japanese and West German bond markets.    &quot;In the current environment, every one percentage point rise in U.S. rates leads to a 0.35 percentage point rise in West German rates and and at least a 0.25 percentage point rise in Japanese rates,&quot; says Mr. Rosenberg. &quot;That's the upward tug U.S. rates exert on overseas rates.&quot; With a de facto fixed exchange rate policy among the major central banks, &quot;Inflation pressures here get exported overseas because commodities are rising in price effectively at the same rate in dollars as yen,&quot; he says.    Interest rates in Britain and France, which were lowered recently, might appear to be the exception to this trend. However, the rate declines stemmed mostly from the strengthening of the pound and French franc against the mark within the European monetary system.    The unusually wide spread currently between three-month and six-month Eurosterling deposit rates is an indication that investors expect higher short-term rates this year, Mr. Rosenberg says. Three-month Eurosterling deposits currently yield about 7 5/8% and six-month Eurosterling deposits yield about 8 3/16%. &quot;The implication is that three-month interest rates in three months&quot; will be significantly higher, he says.    Merrill and Salomon analysts generally favor the Australian, Canadian and French debt markets because they offer dollar-based investors high nominal or inflation-adjusted yields, or both. For instance, one-year Canadian government bills currently yield about 9.6%, or about 0.25 percentage point more than the yield on 30-year U.S. government bonds.    Since the end of April, the yield on 10-year Australian government bonds has climbed to about 12.25% from 11.50%. Since January, the Australian dollar has climbed to 81 cents from 72 cents. French government bonds, currently yielding about 9.05%, have an an inflation-adjusted yield of about 6.5%. &quot;That's the highest in the world right now,&quot; says Mr. Rosenberg.    The U.S. bond market, meanwhile, continues to struggle with two persistent problems. The U.S. trade deficit creates pressure for a lower dollar. The threat of rising inflation becomes greater as the dollar weakens and as capacity constraints associated with the late stage of an economic boom push up wages and prices.    Many U.S. investors aren't so pessimistic about the outlook for interest rates, however. &quot;I've never been more bullish on U.S. bonds,&quot; says Denis Gartman, president of Portsmouth, Va.-based Gartman Financial Services Inc. &quot;The fear of inflation is almost comical and we could easily have a trade surplus by the end of the year&quot; on a current basis, not meaning the entire deficit would be wiped out.    Adds Mr. Gartman: &quot;The bearishness in the bond market right now is reminiscent of the summer of 1981.&quot; That was just before long-term interest rates peaked at a little more than 15% and began an irregular descent to less than 7.20% by the spring of 1986.    ---   Friday's Bond Activity   Prices of government bonds and notes were little changed in quiet trading ahead of the three-day weekend.    The new bellwether 9 1/8% bonds due 2018 rose to 97 30/32 bid from 97 28/32 as the yield declined to 9.33% from 9.34% Thursday. The government's 10-year notes were unchanged at 98 1/2 bid, yielding 9.23%. Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds rose 0.18 point to 1207.13. The index ranged between 1201.77 and 1207.43.    In the money market, rates on the Treasury's latest three-month and six-month bills eased slightly. The rate on the three-month bill fell to 6.44% bid from 6.46% bid Thursday. The rate on the six-month bill declined to 6.84% bid from 6.86% bid.    The rate on Federal funds, or reserves banks lend one another overnight, averaged an estimated 7.46%. Thursday's rate was an effective 7.49%, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. </TEXT></DOC>
