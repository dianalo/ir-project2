(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When W.J. Usery entered the bitterPittston Coal strike he was called a ``supermediator,'' a term thatseems particularly appropriate with both labor and managementpraising the agreement he helped to forge.   ``I've seen so much malice and hate across the table,'' Userysaid, ``but if they really listen to each other, they find they'renot quite as far apart as they thought. Some people say, `You justwear 'em down,' but I don't think that's all true.''   Maybe so. But the former labor secretary readily concedes usingmarathon bargaining sessions in his effort to bring parties toagreement.   Those who've worked with Usery in various negotiations say hesets an unrelenting, sometimes round-the-clock pace at thebargaining table. In the Pittston talks, Usery kept negotiators atthe table for 96 hours straight in a failed bid to reach an accordby Christmas.   He nearly succeeded. The agreement approved by miners Monday hadbeen reached New Year's Eve.   ``When you're on a nine-month strike, sometimes there's atendency to say, `What's another day? What's another week?,'' Userysaid, cautioning that ``if you recess for a few days, then you haveto start all over again when you get back.''   When Usery was tapped by Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole tointervene in the Pittston strike in late October, he hesitated atfirst to enter the fray because of the acrimony between the twosides.   At that point, management and labor hadn't bargained directlywith one another since the walkout began in April. Instead, theywere sending messages back and forth through a federal mediator.   Usery was at the AFL-CIO's winter meeting in Bal Harbour, Fla.,when the United Mine Workers announced Tuesday that Pittstonworkers had ratified the contract and would soon be back to work.   ``It was a very difficult time. I confess I pushed very hard,long hours. I think today it's worth it,'' Usery told miners inCastlewood, Va., on a conference call as the results of the votewere announced.   For his efforts, the Labor Department will pay his firm $250 anhour for days in which he worked less than six hours and $2,750 fordays in which he worked more. Expenses will be paid separately.   Usery has not submitted a bill.   Part of his success, Usery said in an interview, lies in hisability to persuade negotiators to set emotions aside and listen totheir counterparts.   ``People in a strike sometimes just think about themselves. Butit's not just, as in this case, the miners and their families whoare losing money. Management loses, all the general stores, theschools, tax base. ... The churches don't get the same offerings,''said the 66-year-old Usery.   He said that the contract approval represented a huge victoryfor organized labor and that it showed that two sides, no matterhow far apart they are in the bargaining process, can ultimatelyfind a resolution.   Jim Kennedy of the Railway Labor Executive Association saidUsery has won acclaim for bringing two sides together when itappears they are ``locked into their positions and nothing candynamite them out.''   ``I've seen him push and cajole and bully and charm. He'll useany technique,'' Kennedy said.   Longtime aide Herb Fishgold says Usery's own success story _rising from being a shipyard welder to President Ford's laborsecretary _ helps explain his mediating style, which often appealsto negotiators' patriotism.   ``He tries to pay back the country by promoting it,'' Fishgoldsaid. ``I've watched people at these things and you can just tellthey're thinking, `Here we go, another speech about mom and applepie.' But when it's all over, they're saying, `How did he dothat?'''   Usery himself says:   ``I've been accused of waving the flag, of using the flag. Butthe world is so different now; there's a global economy,international concerns. ... We can't afford the luxury of long,lenthy disputes.''   Bob Healey, who was president of the Chicago Teachers Union whenUsery helped settle a three-week strike there in 1983,goodnaturedly divulged that Usery sometimes would disappear forthree or four hours during negotiations. ``We thought he was intrying to sell it to the school board, but we learned later hesneaks up and takes naps while nobody's looking.''   Usery grew up in Hardwick, Ga., and began his working career asa shipyard welder in World War II before joining the Navy andserving in the Pacific. After his discharge, he worked for theArmstrong Cork Co., where he helped organize a Machinists unionlocal.   Former President Nixon brought Usery to Washington in 1969 as anassistant secretary of labor. Usery immediately won praise forhelping resolve complicated railroad and airline disputes withoutCongress having to step in.   He was named director of the Federal Mediation and ConciliationService in 1973. In 1976 Ford appointed him secretary of labor.   Since going into private business, Usery has helped mediatedisputes involving Chicago public school teachers, the United AutoWorkers and General Motors and Toyota, and pro football players.</TEXT></DOC>
