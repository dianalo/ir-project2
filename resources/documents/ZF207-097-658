 It Just Might HappenandM;People who create &quot;virus&quot; programs and spread them through computer networksoften do so thinking that nothing is going to happen to them if they getcaught.andP;  At most, they think, they'll get a friendly &quot;don't let it happenagain&quot; warning from a judge.andM;As I said last time, though, the law is definitely not short on statutes,doctrines and other means of clamping down on virus engineers and otherhackers.andP;  In this column, I'll examine possible vehicles for the criminalprosecution of hacking.andM;Wire fraud penalties.andP;  If someone uses a telecommunications system ininterstate or foreign commerce to commit a crime, punishment can be heavyfines and as many as five years in jail.andP;  In the past, federal wire fraudlaws have been employed with some success to prosecute hackers and othercomputer trouble-makers.andM;Computer crime laws.andP;  Almost every state in the United States now has acomputer crime law on the books, and the federal government has three.andP;  Themost recently enacted of these federal laws makes it a crime to interceptdigital communications.andM;Such interceptions formerly fell under the aegis of wiretapping.andP;  For manyyears, hackers were able to avoid criminal prosecution by arguing that thefederal wiretap laws didn't cover computer communications.andP;  Well, they can'tuse that dodge any longer.andM;Some states, such as California, have actually amended their old computercrime laws to address the threat of hacking.andP;  Even in states that haven'ttaken this step, the lack of prosecutorial vigor on the part of stateauthorities is caused primarily by insufficient resources and misguidedpriorities, rather than badly drafted laws.andP;  But this situation should changeas the public increasingly focuses on computer-related abuses.andM;RICO.andP;  The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act is increasinglybeing used to prosecute white-collar crimes, including telecommunicationsfrat.andP;  And computer hacking certainly qualifies as a white-collar crime.andM;RICO is usually associated with organized-crime cases, but VISA Internationalrecently used it to go after &quot;boiler room&quot; marketing operations that had beenlaundering bank card drafts by depositing them in unrelated businessaccounts.andM;In a RICO case, all the prosecutor must show is that a defendant violatedwire fraud laws to promote a &quot;racketeering&quot; activity--which, as the VISA caseshows, can mean just about anything illegal.andP;  It's only a matter of timebefore an innovative prosecutor unleashes RICO on hackers.andM;EFT laws.andP;  At the federal level, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act makes it acrime to tamper with EFT systems.andM;Many states have their own versions of the federal law.andP;  The upshot is thathackers who tamper with or infect banking systems with a virus could findthemselves in deep trouble.andP;  Add this criminal penalty to the civil liabilityof having to pick up the tab for interfering with a bank's businessoperations, and you have a real double whammy for hackers!andM;Consumer laws.andP;  The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Right to FinancialPrivacy Act and other laws make it a crime to gain unauthorized access to anindividual's financial files.andP;  Many states have similar laws on their books.andM;So far, these laws haven't been used to prosecute hackers, but they have beensuccessful in snagging thieves trafficking in consumer records.andM;Regulatory liabilities.andP;  The U.S.andP;  economy has appropriately been called oneof the most regulated in the world.andP;  The U.S.andP;  Securities and ExchangeCommission requires brokerage firms to maintain records in a specifiedmanner.andP;  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. requires the same thing ofbanks.andP;  And the list goes on and on.andM;These regulatory bodies also provide for legal sanctions against insiders whoabuse or misuse records entrusted to them or their organizations.andP;  In otherwords, an employee who hacks his or her employer's computer system could facemore than a wrist slapping from a regulatory agency.andP;  In some isntances, thematter might even be referred to the U.S.andP;  Department of Justice for criminalprosecution.andM;Over the years, hackers have escaped the ire of the government and theprivate sector, but one must attribute this largely to ignorance rather thenan absence of laws.andP;  Our legal system is more than adequately prepared atboth the civil and criminal levels to deal with hackers.andP;  As soon as creativelawyers zero in on computer troublemakers, the rules of the game will changeand the electronic joyride will finally end.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
