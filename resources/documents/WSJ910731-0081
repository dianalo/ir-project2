In somecircles, they're celebrities. But how do theirrecommendations pan out? Who's the best market-timer? Whotends to like stocks best, or bonds or cash? And who has theworst record?   This newspaper, with help from Wilshire Associates inSanta Monica, Calif., has been tracking the asset-allocationperformance of 10 leading brokerage firms. Looking back on 41/2 years of recommendations, here's how an awards ceremonymight go. The envelopes, please:   Best Market Timer. Edward Kerschner of PaineWebber Inc. Byadjusting his recommended blend -- a dash more of stocks onemonth, an extra sprinkling of bonds another -- he has added2.7 percentage points a year to his long-term return.   That's according to calculations by Robin Carpenter,president of Economics Office in Cambridge, Mass. Mr.Carpenter compared each of the strategists' actualperformance with what it would have been had the strategistalways stuck to his own average blend.   Mr. Kerschner attributes his market-timing success to the&quot;dogma of remaining disciplined.&quot; That means buying an assetclass when it looks undervalued and selling when it looksovervalued, regardless of its popularity at the time.   Despite PaineWebber's market-timing flair, it ranked onlyin the middle of the pack in long-term total return: 64.3%for the full 54 months for which the Journal has collecteddata on brokerage houses' asset-allocation advice. Itsaverage blend wasn't as bullish as those of some competitors,and the period since the start of 1987 has been, overall, aperiod of rising stock prices. Right now Mr. Kerschner thinksstocks look slightly better than bonds; he expects the DowJones Industrial Average to hit 3150 by year end.                                                                                                          Best Performance, Long-Term. Greg Smith of PrudentialSecurities Co., whose stock-heavy blends have worked out wellover the long haul. People following Mr. Smith's advice sinceJan. 1, 1987, have earned an estimated 81% return, assumingtheir stock-picking and bond-picking skills were average.   Mr. Smith expects nothing big from the financial marketsfor the next 12 months. He thinks stocks should provide a 10%return (including dividends), thanks mostly to a recoveringeconomy. Bonds, he figures, won't change much in price, andwill yield about 8.5%. He thinks cash equivalents will yielda measly 5.5%. But Mr. Smith recommends that investors keep20% in cash anyway, so they'll be able to snap up bargains ifstocks or bonds decline.                                                                                                          Worst Performance, Long-Term. A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc. ofSt. Louis, held back by its loyalty to bonds. Bonds gainedonly 41.5% over the full 54 months for which the Journal hascollected data, compared with 78.8% for stocks. EconomistRaymond Worseck says the firm has stepped up its commitmentto stocks. For example, it currently recommends 50% stocksand 40% bonds.                                                                                                          Most Devoted to Stocks. Mr. Smith of Prudential, whoseportfolios have bulged with an average 77.8% stocks. In partsof 1988-1989, Mr. Smith even went so far as to urge a 100%stock position. Right now, Mr. Smith recommends a 60% stockallocation -- for him, pretty unenthusiastic.   &quot;I'm finding some okay ideas, but few really good ones,&quot;he says. &quot;When you find a good business, it's usually fullypriced.&quot; Why, then, does he still recommend 60% in stocks?&quot;Nothing else looks very good either.&quot;                                                                                                          Most Devoted to Bonds. A.G. Edwards, with an average bondallocation of 45.1%. Mr. Worseck terms bonds &quot;unexciting&quot; forthe moment, deserving only 40% of an investor's funds. &quot;Webelieve {Fed Chairman Alan} Greenspan is on the path thatcould get the core rate of inflation down to 2% or 2.5% by1993,&quot; he says. The problem, in his view, is that investorsdon't yet believe it. Until a &quot;dramatic event&quot; convincesthem, he thinks bonds will stay about where they are.                                                                                                          Most Devoted to Cash. Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co., averaging32.7% cash equivalents. But that's a reflection of days goneby. Kidder generally recommended conservative blends in 1987through mid-1990. These days, with short-term interest ratesdown below 6%, the General Electric Co. unit recommends thatinvestors put all their money into stocks and bonds.                                                                                                          Itchiest Trigger Finger. PaineWebber's Mr. Kerschner. Hechanges his blend slightly almost every month, with aggregatechanges of 321 percentage points in 54 months. (Moving 10% ofa portfolio from stocks to bonds, for example, counts as 10percentage points.) Mr. Kerschner thinks such shifts pay off:&quot;You need, basically, to fine-tune.&quot;                                                                                                          Least Itchy Trigger Finger. Michael Sherman of ShearsonLehman Brothers Inc. In 4 1/2 years, he altered his blend 14times, with aggregate changes of only 85 percentage points.Steven Einhorn at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. made even fewer blendchanges, but they aggregated 108 percentage points.                                                                                                          Most Eggs in One Basket. No surprise -- it's Mr. Smith ofPrudential, who tends to go heavy on stocks. The gauge ofportfolio concentration is the Herfindahl index,traditionally used in antitrust enforcement to see, forexample, how tightly the four leading brands dominate thecereal market. Mr. Carpenter of Economics Office applied itto portfolios. Mr. Smith's Herfindahl score is 0.71.                                                                                                          Most Diverse Portfolio. Raymond James andamp; Associates Inc.,St. Petersburg, Fla., with a Herfindahl index of 0.36. Thefirm does its asset allocation by committee, and sometimesrecommends four or five asset classes, with real estate andgold in addition to stocks, bonds and cash.                                                                                                          Worst Performance, Three Months. Raymond James, up only0.1%. But the 1991 second quarter was a blah period foreveryone. Stocks were down 0.2%. The best asset, cash, was up1.5%. In that gray environment, there was scant differencebetween best and worst.                                                                                                          Best Performance, Three Months. Charles Clough of MerrillLynch andamp; Co., up 0.8%. His longstanding emphasis on bondshelped, as bonds provided a 1.51% return in the secondquarter. Also, Mr. Clough trimmed stocks a bit in mid-April,which proved timely.   &quot;I definitely dislike cash,&quot; says Mr. Clough. He thinksbanks will keep deposit rates low, because they don't reallyneed more funds to lend. He thinks the Federal Reserve mightmove to lower interest rates further, giving stocks a boost.But with bonds yielding 8.5%, he says, they're toughcompetition for stocks.                                                                                                          Worst Performance, 12 Months: Dean Witter, which has losttwo strategists, John Connolly and Suresh Bhirud, in the 12months through June 30. Dean Witter was up only 4.6%. Astatic blend of 55% stocks, 35% bonds and 10% cash would havegained 8.6%. In retrospect, Dean Witter misjudged marketreaction to the war against Iraq: The firm was too bullish ashostilities approached, and too cautious once war broke out.                                                                                                          Best Performance, 12 Months: Kidder Peabody did just theopposite. It had a fairly cautious blend when Iraq invadedKuwait in August 1990, but stepped up its commitment tostocks just in time to catch the big rally that began inOctober. Credit is divided between George Boyd, the firm'sformer tactical asset-allocation guru (now departed to workas a money manager), and his successor, Easton Ragsdale.   Kidder remains quite bullish, recommending 70% stocks, 30%bonds. &quot;Part of the market is worried about a weak economy,and part is worried about inflation,&quot; says Mr. Ragsdale. Hesays at least one of those worries is likely to proveunfounded, and he hopes both of them will.   ---                 Who Has the Best Blend?
