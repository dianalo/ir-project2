 &quot;It's getting easier all the time,&quot; says Chris Veal, a partner inthe San Jose, Calif., office of Arthur Young andamp; Co., a Big Eight accountingfirm.andP;  Veal's office is now 80% Mac-based and 20% PC-based.andP;  But even if allthe office computers were Macs, he says, sharing data with PCs would still benecessary because many clients use them.andM;Sharing files between Macs and PCs is a two-part problem.andP;  The first part ofthe problem involves the physical transfer of file from one machine's disk toanother's.andP;  The second part is the translation of files from the format ofthe originating application to a format that the new application can read.andM;The hardware connectionandM;Transferring files usually requires a hardware link, but Apple Computer's newFloppy Drive High Density (FDHD) disk drive for the Mac IIX and Mac SE 30eliminates the need for extra hardware.andP;  The FDHD reads the 3-1/2-inch PCdisk format, as well as the Mac II disk format, says CRaig Elliot, Apple'smarketing manager for MS-DOS and OS/2 integration.andM;Another high-density drive, the Turbo Floppy ($395 from Peripheral Land,Fremont, Calif.) works with all Macs.andP;  The drive supports both 720K and1.44-megabyte floppy disks and can read and write to 3-1/2-inch DOS-formatteddisks.andM;Aside from specialized disk drives, there are plenty of other ways to makethe hardware connection.andP;  Perhaps the simplest is with communication links.andO;You can use a modem to communicate date either directly or via an on-lineservice such as MCI Mail.andP;  Or you can move data across a local area networksuch as Apple's AppleShare or Novell's NetWare.andM;You can also use a shared file server, which offers the advantage of lettingPC and Mac owners share data directly, without the intermediate step offile-format translation.andP;  However, you don't need to buy a new computer ordrive to act as a file server.andP;  You can install an interface board in your PCand connect the PC to the Mac.andP;  Foe example, DayStar Digital (Flowery Branch,Ga.) sells the LT200 interface board ($249; $395 for the Micro Channelversion), which lets IBM PCs and PS/2s share any file server under LocalTalk,Apple's network software.andP;  Steve Simpson, DayStar's marketing director, notesthan any PC with w hard disk can act as a shared server under LocalTalk.andM;Another way of transferring files directly is to connect a Mac and a PC witha product such as LapLink Mac ($139.95, from Traveling Software, Bothell,Wash.) or MacLink Plus ($195, from Dataviz, Trumbull, Conn.).andP;  Both productsinclude a cable that connects the serial ports of the machines, plus softwarethat handles both communications and file-format translations.andP;  The maindifference between the two products is that LapLink Mac is controlled fromthe PC and MacLink Plus is controlled from the Mac.andM;Traveling Software created LapLink Mac to handles its own connectivityproblems.andP;  President Mark Eppley recalls that he tried to transfer a scannedimage from a PC to a Macintosh a few years ago and couldn't find anythingthat worked fast enough.andP;  &quot;Speed is especially important when transferringgraphics files,&quot; he says.andP;  LapLink Mac, Eppley says, can transfer files at upto 57,200 bits per second.andM;The fastest way to transfer files, however, is by using a direct connectionthrough the Mac's SCSI (small computer systems interface) port, says CynthiaHarriman, coauthor of the MS-DOS-Mac Connection: Data Sharing, Networking andSupport in the Mixed Office ($21.95, Brady Books, 1988).andP;  To make theconnection, you can use a product such as Quickshare ($465, from CompatibleSystems Corp., Boulder, Colo.), which includes a special cable and a SCSIboard for your PC.andP;  &quot;For big files,&quot; says Harriman, &quot;the speed is a realadvantage.&quot;andM;Software solutionsandM;Physical connections are only half the battle.andP;  The other half is the problemof translating back and forth between files created on PCs and those createdon Macs.andP;  With text files, for instance, how do you translate from the Mac'sbit-map formats to the PC's ASCII formats?andP;  With graphics files, how do youtranslate the square-bit maps of the Mac into the rectangular-bit maps of thePC?andM;Files from some programs, such as WordPerfect, Microsoft Word, and AldusCorp.'s PageMaker, don't have to be translated because the Mac and PCversions of these programs can use the same file formats.andP;  For files thatmust be translated, however, software solutions abound.andP;  Mastersoft (Phoenix)licenses its translation program, Word for Word, to several vendors,including Traveling Software, which uses it in LapLink Mac.andP;  The retailversion, Word for Word Professional ($149), translates only among MS-DOSformats, but Word for Word Macintosh, which will translate between Mac and PCformats, is due out this month, according to Lise Lambert, Mastersoft's vicepresident of marketing.andM;Like LapLink Mac's software, a new program called x-Fer ($99.95, fromMessenger Software, Rocky River, Ohio) handles both communications andtranslations between PCs and Macs.andP;  The program can process single files orentire directories, in both directions.andP;  &quot;Once you set up the process withpasswords and baud rates,&quot; says John Katzendorn, Messenger's president, &quot;it'sall done from the Mac.&quot;andP;  Some xFer translations, such as those from 1-2-3 toMicrosoft Excel, are quick and simple.andP;  For other files, such as databasefiles and many word-processor files, you have to set up your own translationtables in xFer.andM;Translating graphics files is a tougher job.andP;  Some graphics translations canbe handled by a public domain program called Mac-Wind, author Harriman says.andO;The program translates MacPaint's PICT files into the MSP format ofMicrosoft's Windows Paint program.andP;  Programmers Joel Finkel and Peter Sillsof Chicago created Mac-Wind to give Windows users access to the largeclip-art collections available for the Macintosh.andP;  But Harriman notes thateven small translations take time.andP;  In one case, Harriman found that Mac-Windtook 65 seconds to translate a 9,447-byte MacPaint file into a Windows Paintfile.andM;Except for color files created on the Mac II, most Macintosh graphics filesise the PICT format, but PC graphics programs use many different formats.andO;The .CGM and .GMF file extensions of Lotus Freelance Plus Release 3.0, forexample, use the Metafile standard endorsed by the American NationalStandards Institute, but 1-2-3 and Symphony create PIC files.andP;  Z-soft Corp.'sPC Paintbrush creates PCC and PCX files, and Digital Research's GEM operatingenvironment creates GEM and IMG files.andP;  Then there's the TIFF (tagged imagefile format) standard used by PageMaker and other programs requiringextensive use of gray scales.andP;  To complicate matters further, there are bothPC and Mac versions of some file-format standards.andM;The Graphics Link Plus+ ($149.95, from PC Quik-Art, AThens, Ga.) cantranslate among all IBM PC or Mac bit-map graphics formats.andP;  But even withthe growing body of file-translation software, says James Alexander,president of PC Quik-Art, file-translation problems will be around for awhile.andP;  &quot;Every program seems to have its own file format, which its creatorscall proprietary,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;There are more than 100 variations of Z-Soft'sPCC file format alone.&quot;andM;Another complication in translating graphics files is that while mostgraphics programs create bit-mapped files, programs such as AutoCAd and othercomputer-aided-design programs create object-oriented graphics fileS.andP;  Inorder to understand the difference between bit-mapped and object-orientedgraphics, imagine drawing a circle on top of a square.andP;  If you then removethe circle, a bit-mapped prgram will lose the part of the square that isunder the circle, but an object-oriented program understands the relationshipof objects and will save the entire square.andM;Object-oriented graphics files have their own translation problens andsolutions.andP;  One program, CADMover ($495, from Kandu Software, Arlington,Va.), translates the DXF format used by AutoCAD, VersaCAD, MaxiCAD, and somepopular Mac programs to the Mac's PICT format.andP;  Ken Lathan, Kandu's directorof software development, says CADMover can also read the IGES format oftenused on the DEC VAX and other mainframes.andM;Sharing files between Macs and PCs takes a little finesse, but with the righthardware and software, you can open a Lotus or Microsoft file on the PC andmove it to the Mac--fonts, formatting, and all.andP;  Despite the complications,notes DayStar's Simpson, &quot;software is bringing Macs and PCs closer everyday.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
