SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In the latest body blow to Californiaaerospace, Northrop Corp. said Wednesday it would cut 3,000 jobs or7 percent of its workforce by year end because of defense spendingcuts on its B-2 bomber.   The radar-dodging, bat-winged stealth bomber made up 58 percentof Northrop's $1.28 billion in first-quarter sales.   As world tensions ease, however, Defense Secretary Dick Cheneyhas proposed cutting purchases of the bomber from 132 to 75. Peakproduction would fall from 36 planes a year to 12.   ``World events, government decisions, economic conditions, areall evolving at a rapid rate _ at an unprecedented rate,'' ChiefExecutive Kent Kresa said in announcing the cuts, which will be metthrough layoffs and attrition.   ``Questions are being asked about fundamental assumptions thathave not been questioned since many of us here were children,'' hesaid in remarks prepared for Northrop's annual meeting Wednesday.   Spokesman Tony Cantafio said 2,700 jobs will be lost in SouthernCalifornia. That follows news last week that McDonnell DouglasCorp. would cut 4,000 jobs, mostly in Long Beach, and that LockheedCorp. would shut down in Burbank, eliminating 4,500 local jobs overthe next few years.   The layoffs could create a ripple effect through the aerospaceindustry, the greatest source of manufacturing jobs in the region.Chamber of Commerce economist Jack Kyser said 70 percent of thearea's aerospace companies employ 50 or fewer workers. Kresa notedthat Northrop has 6,000 subcontractors and suppliers in the region.   ``On our major programs today, Northrop as prime contractor isresponsible for only 30 or 40 percent of the work; 60 to 70 percentis done by our subcontractors and suppliers,'' Kresa said. ``Theyalso will be among the first to feel the effects of budgetreductions and stretchouts.''   Northrop's employment peaked at 48,200 at the end of 1987. Itcut 2,500 employees during the past year, and currently has about41,000 workers.   Kresa said Northrop can eliminate its $1 billion debt by themid-1990s through cost-cutting and sale of assets. The company madean after-tax gain of $90 million and cut its short-term debt by$218 million through the recent sale and partial leaseback of itscorporate headquarters complex.   Northrop officials wouldn't say what assets might be sold.   Kresa also set a goal for Northrop, which lost $63.5 millionlast year, or returning to the 20 percent return-on-equity level itachieved in the mid-'80s.   ``I was impressed by his comments,'' said Lawrence Harris, asecurities analyst with Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in LosAngeles. ``The 20 percent return-on-equity goal is certainlyambitious, but it's the kind of target the Street would be lookingfor on a long-term basis.''</TEXT></DOC>
