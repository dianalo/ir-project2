(IGC) of Santa Clara, Calif., allows each workstation to actlike a separate PC running DOS and standard DOS applications, McMillan said.andM;With the NetPak add-on program -- also licensed from IGC -- the system can belinked via the host with LANs from Novell Inc., 3Com Corp. and IBM, officialssaid.andM;An eight-station system with a 386 PC acting as host, a mouse at each nodeand the maximum length of fiber cable retails for less than $20,000, McMillansaid.andM;System components are also available individually.andP;  Monitor, keyboard andworkstation modules together are priced at $1,495, the fiber-optic interfaceboard is $795, PC Light VM/386 is $895, and NetPak is $195.andP;  Softworks, anational distributor, will sell the products.andM;Analysts said the PC Light system could find buyers at the low end of themultiuser marketplace.andP;  &quot;It supports FDDI, so if fiber becomes moreaffordable, then it has a pretty good future,&quot; said Dave Hickey, staff writerfor Datapro Research Group's Report on PC and LAN Communications in Delran,N.J.andM;Star Gate can be reached at (800) 782-7428.andP;  Softworks can be reached at(800) 332-3475.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
