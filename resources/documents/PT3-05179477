Field of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  The present invention relates to a helical scan type video tape recorder      (hereinafter called VTR), and more particularly, to a VTR wherein a sag      distortion, a skew distortion and a phase distortion are eliminated from a      reproduced video signal, thereby providing an improved picture quality. </PAR><PAR>  2. Description of the Prior Art </PAR><PAR>  Heretofore, a sag distortion has been encountered in a reproduction of      video signal by a signal head VTR. FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing a      prior art video signal reproducing system and FIG. 2 is a plan view of a      rotary drum having a single video head to be used therein. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to FIG. 1, the prior art video signal reproducing system      comprises a rotary transformer 11, an amplifier 12, a signal processing      circuit 23, a demodulator circuit 20, a clamp circuit 21, a synchronous      separation circuit 22, a clamp circuit 45, an A/D converter 24, a memory      unit 26, a memory unit control circuit 31, and a D/A converter 33. In FIG.      2, 3 denotes a rotary drum, 5 denotes a single video head and 2 denotes a      video tape. </PAR><PAR>  In the prior art VTR shown partly in FIG. 1, the single video head 5      reproduces a FM signal 13 shown in FIG. 3(d) from the video tape 2 by      being switched (switcher is not shown) by a head switching signal 17 shown      in FIG. 3(b). The reproduced FM signal 13 reproduced by the single video      head 5 is demodulated at the demodulator circuit 20 into a video signal 43      having a signal field and a no-signal field, alternatively, as it is shown      in FIG. 3(e). This video signal 43 is then fed to the clamp circuit 21      before applying to the synchronous separation circuit 22 for fixing a      sync-tip level to a constant level. However, a time constant of the clamp      circuit 21 has normally been selected to be 10 times as much as an      interval of horizontal synchronizing signal, thereby generating sags in a      clamped video signal 44 as shown in FIG. 3(f). Therefore, if such a      clamped video signal 44 is fed to the A/D converter 24 for converting it      into a digital signal and further a no-signal field thereof is      supplemented with a video signal in the preceding signal field by      utilizing the memory unit 26 and the memory unit control circuit 31, a      resultant video signal 32 may have a sag in each field, as shown in FIG.      3(g), and be fed to the D/A converter 33 for converting it into a      distorted analog signal. </PAR><PAR>  Accordingly, there has been a problem of sag distortion that results in a      considerable disturbance of display as it is hard to detect vertical and      horizontal synchronizing pulses at the synchronous separation circuit 22      in the duration of the sags. </PAR><PAR>  A skew distortion has also been encountered in the prior art VTR      reproducing system such shown by a block diagram in FIG. 4. Referring to      FIG. 4, a reproduced FM signal 13 reproduced from a head 5 is amplified at      an amplifier 12 and fed to a switcher 18 which is operated by a switching      signal 17. The reproduced FM signal 19 switched at the switcher 18 is then      demodulated into a video signal 43 at a demodulator 20 and clamped to a      certain level at the tip end of a synchronizing signal thereof in a clamp      circuit 21. The clamped video signal 44 is fed to an A/D converter 24 and      is digitized therein. The digitized video signal 25 is then fed to a      memory unit 26. </PAR><PAR>  A memory unit control circuit 31 starts writing the digitized signal 25      into the memory unit 26 from a start point WR in the signal field and the      writing and the reading are repeatedly executed at a sampling rate in the      duration of the signal field whilst the video signal written in the memory      unit 26 in the duration of the preceding signal field is read out during      the no-signal field starting from a start point RR. The video signal 32      read out from the memory unit 26 is fed to a D/A converter 33 for      converting it into an analog signal to attain a reproduced video signal 34      shown in FIG. 5 (c) (shown only by a horizontal synchronizing signal). </PAR><PAR>  Since the prior art system has been arranged as described above, if the      reproduced video signal performs an interlace scanning, an interval of      horizontal synchronizing pulses at the switch over point will become 1.5H      as it is shown in FIG. 5(c), losing a continuity of the horizontal      synchronizing signal and causing such a problem as skew distortion in      every field. </PAR><PAR>  Moreover, a phase distortion has been encountered in a reproduced video      signal in accordance with the prior art VTR reproducing system, especially      in a case when a recorded video signal is reproduced in a different speed      from that of the recording. </PAR><PAR>  Now referring to FIG. 6, there is shown a prior art rotary drum assembly in      a cross section. The rotary drum assembly consists of a rotary shaft 1, a      fixed lower drum 10, an upper rotary drum 3, a head bed 4 secured to the      upper rotary drum 3 by screws, video heads 5 mounted at the periphery of      the head bed 4 and shown together with a video tape 2, bearings 6, an      upper rotary transformer 7 fixed to the upper rotary drum 3 to be rotated      therewith, a stationary lower transformer 8, a pedestal 9 secured to the      rotary shaft 1 to support the upper rotary drum 3, a magnet 75 mounted on      the upper rotary drum 3 and a magnetic detector 76 arranged in proximity      of the magnet 75 for detecting magnetic fluxes therefrom to determine a      rotary position of the upper rotary drum 3. </PAR><PAR>  The video heads 5 traverse across the video tape 2 in a slant-wise by the      rotation thereof and the travel of video tape 2 for forming parallel      tracks as it is shown in FIG. 7. Referring now to FIG. 7(a) through (d),      there are shown several tracks formed by the relative movements of the      rotary heads 5 and the video tape 2, wherein A2 designates a track of the      traveling video tape 2, V1 designates a normal traveling speed of the      video tape 2, A5 designates tracks of the rotary heads 5 and V designates      a speed of the rotary heads 5. Since the track A2 and the tracks A5 are      crossed as shown in the drawing, relative tracks to be formed on the      traveling video tape 2 by the rotary heads 5 are represented by tracks A      in FIG. 7(a). In a still display playback mode, the traveling speed of the      video tape 2 is 0 and the relative tracks A0 conform to A5. In a slow      motion display playback mode, the traveling speed of the video tape 2 is      decreased from V1 to Vs and the relative tracks of the rotary heads 5      against the traveling video tape 2 are represented by As in FIG. 7(b). </PAR><PAR>  In a VTR employing such a rotary drum assembly, as described above, a      pseudo-vertical synchronizing signal for a reproduced video signal is      generated with a constant phase relationship to a head switching signal in      case of playing back a recorded video signal from the video tape 2 other      than the normal traveling speed of V1 and combined to the reproduced video      signal to form a composite video signal. However, in this type of      play-back mode, the rotary heads 5 do not trace the relative tracks A or      recorded tracks, which are formed on the video tape 2 at normal traveling      speed by the rotary heads 5, and a signal output level is decreased      considerably, then, over and above this, noises are generated due to off      tracking of the rotary heads 5. Thus, it is hard to attain a clear display      from the reproduced video signal because of a poor S/N ratio. </PAR><PAR>  Heretofore, it has been proposed to utilize a rotary drum assembly having      an arrangement to displace the rotary heads 5 so as to trace the recorded      tracks accurately under any traveling speed of the video tape 2. The      rotary drum assembly of this type is shown in FIG. 8 partly in a cross      section. In this illustration, a drive unit 40 displaces the rotary heads      5 in the lateral direction of the video tape 2 upon receipt of a control      signal from the outside through a slip-ring coupling composed of a contact      52 and a ring electrode 53. An amount of displacement of the rotary heads      5 is so selected, for instance, in the case of slow motion play-back mode      with a tape traveling speed of Vs, so as to change the tracks A5 of the      rotary heads 5 to be A51 within one field play-back period of time in      order to make relative tracks coincide with the relative tracks A of the      normal tape traveling speed as it is shown clearly in FIG. 7(c). </PAR><PAR>  More generally, it is required to displace the displaceable rotary heads by      an amount of P(1-Vs/v) (where Vs/v is Vs/V1) in the duration of one field      play-back period of time under any slow tape traveling speed of Vs to make      the rotary heads trace the recorded tracks without deviation. If the tape      traveling speed is decreased from V1 to V1/2, the same track may be traced      a plurality of times by the rotary heads. In FIG. 7(d), there is shown an      example wherein the video tape 2 is traveling at V1/2 and the rotary heads      5 are so displaced in the lateral direction of the video tape 2 as to      align relative tracks with the relative tracks A for tracing the track A      at the position of L0. In this example, a switching point of the rotary      heads is given by So. In the next field, the tracing will be made on a      track at the position of L1 which is parted from the previously traced      track by an amount of P/2 and a switching point of the rotary heads will      be given by S1 provided that the rotary heads are displaced so as to trace      the track at L1. Accordingly, a phase difference between reproduced video      signals derived from the tracks at the Lo and L1 is given by      1/2.multidot..alpha. H based on the switching points of So and S1. </PAR><PAR>  As it has been described above, in accordance with the prior art system,      there has been a problem such that if a pseudo-vertical synchronizing      signal generator circuit being capable of generating a pseudo-vertical      synchronizing signal with a constant phase is employed for the reproduced      video signal which has a different phase in every field, there may cause      vertical vibrations or a jitter in the displayed pictures due to the fact      that the phase difference between the inserted pseudo-vertical signal and      the reproduced video signal varies by an amount of 1/2.alpha. H for every      trace (in the case of slow motion play-back with the tape traveling speed      of V1/2). </PAR><PAR>  It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a VTR that      can reproduce a stable image in good picture quality with no distortions      by eliminating sags from the reproduced video signal. </PAR><PAR>  It is an another object of the present invention to provide a VTR that can      reproduce a stable image in good picture quality with no distortions by      eliminating skews from the reproduced video signal. </PAR><PAR>  It is still another object of present invention to provide a VTR that can      produce a stable image in good picture quality with no distortions      regardless of tape traveling speed by eliminating phase distortions due to      use of a pseudo-vertical synchronizing signal generator being capable of      generating a pseudo-vertical synchronizing signal having no phase shifting      from the tape traveling speed. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  In accordance with the present invention, there is provided an improved      video signal reproducer that can afford to reproduce a high quality video      signal with no distortions in a VTR. </PAR><PAR>  According to a first aspect of the present invention, a problem of sag      distortion is solved by applying a continuous reproduced video signal with      no field interval intermission to a clamp circuit for eliminating      durations where a horizontal and a vertical synchronizing signals are not      detected by a synchronous separation circuit. More specifically, the video      signal reproducer in one preferred embodiment of the present invention      includes a circuit for inserting a FM signal reproduced by a pair of      rotary heads, which are mounted across a rotary drum besides a single      rotary head, into a no-signal field interval of a FM signal being      reproduced by the single rotary head, and a circuit for replacing the      inserted signal with a demodulated video signal in the preceding signal      field interval after demodulating the FM signals. </PAR><PAR>  According to a second aspect of the present invention, a problem of skew      distortion is solved by reading out a stored video signal from a memory      unit under the control of a read control circuit in such a manner as to      keep a continuity of horizontal synchronization by making a horizontal      scanning period 1 H at the switch over point of a no-signal field interval      and a signal field interval in the reproduced video signal for not causing      synchronization disturbance thereat. More specifically, the video signal      reproducer in another preferred mode of the present invention includes      circuits wherein write/read of the reproduced video signal to/from the      memory unit is carried out simultaneously during the signal field interval      in synchronization with a horizontal synchronizing signal, while the      reading of the video signal from the memory unit in the succeeding      no-signal field interval is so controlled as to maintain the continuity of      timing by providing a horizontal scanning period of 1 H from the last      horizontal synchronizing pulse of the video signal in the preceding signal      field interval. </PAR><PAR>  According to a third aspect of the present invention, a problem of vertical      synchronizing phase distortion is solved by inserting a pseudo-vertical      synchronizing signal, which has a specific phase relationship with a video      tape phase standard signal and is dependent upon a traveling speed of the      video tape, into a reproduced video signal for eliminating the disturbance      in the vertical synchronization. More specifically, the video signal      reproducer in still another preferred embodiment of the present invention      comprises a pseudo-vertical synchronizing signal generator being capable      of generating the pseudo-vertical synchronizing signal, which has a      specific phase relationship with the video tape phase standard signal      regardless of the traveling speed of the video tape, based on a tape phase      standard signal which is recorded on the video tape within a frame period,      rotation pulses which stand for a rotational speed of a capstan or an      amount of traveling of the video tape and a head switching signal. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a known video signal reproducer for use in a      VTR; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a plan view of a known configuration of a rotary head drum; </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 3b-g are a timing diagram showing the waveforms at various parts of      in the block diagram of FIG. 1; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a block diagram of a known video signal reproducer for use in a      VTR; </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 5a-c are a timing diagram showing the write/read timing at the memory      unit in the block diagram of FIG. 4; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is a sectional view of a known rotary head drum; </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 7a-d are a schematic diagram showing the relationship between the      recorded tracks on the video tape and the scanning tracks by the rotary      heads; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 8 is a sectional view of a rotary head drum of the type having      displaceable rotary heads; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 9 is a block diagram showing the total arrangement of the video signal      reproducer for use in a VTR embodying the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 10 is a block diagram showing a preferred embodiment of this      invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 11 is a plan view of the rotary head drum to be used in the embodiment      of this invention shown in FIG. 10; </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 12a-g are a timing diagram showing the waveforms at the various parts      of the embodiment of this invention shown in FIG. 10; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 13 is a block diagram showing another preferred embodiment of this      invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 14a-g are a timing diagram showing the waveforms at the various parts      of the embodiment of this invention shown in FIG. 13; </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 15a-e are a timing diagram showing the write/read timing at the      memory unit in the block diagram of FIG. 13; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 16 is a block diagram showing still another preferred embodiment of      this invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 17 is a block diagram showing the rotary head drum control circuit in      the embodiment of this invention shown in FIG. 16; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 18 is a block diagram showing the pseudo-vertical synchronizing signal      generator circuit in the embodiment of this invention shown in FIG. 16;      and </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 19a-d are a timing diagram showing the pseudo-vertical synchronizing      signal timing in the generator circuit of FIG. 18. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </PAC><PAR>  Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described more      in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the several      figures like reference numerals identify like elements. Referring first to      FIG. 9, there is shown the total arrangement of the video signal      reproducer fragmentarily shown in FIG. 10, FIG. 13, FIG. 16, FIG. 17 and      FIG. 18 for use in a rotary head type VTR. The detailed description will      be made with reference to the respective drawings hereinafter. The first      embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference      to FIGS. 10 through 12, numerals 5a and 5b denote a pair of rotary heads      mounted across a rotary drum 3 and numeral 5c denotes a single rotary head      mounted on the same rotary drum 3. Picked up signals at each rotary head      5a, 5b and 5c are fed respectively to video amplifiers 12a, 12b and 12c      through rotary transformers 11a, 11b and 11c. The reproduced FM signal      13c, shown in FIG. 12(d), is fed to a signal switching circuit (2) 18      after being amplified at the video amplifier 12c while the reproduced FM      signals from the pair of rotary heads 5a, 5b are fed to a signal switching      circuit (1) after being amplified at the video amplifiers 12a and 12b. The      signal switching circuit (1) 14 is switched by a switching signal 16 shown      in FIG. 12(a) and derives a reproduced FM signal 15 shown in FIG. 12(c)      therefrom. The reproduced FM signal 15 is then fed to the signal switching      circuit (2) 18 together with the reproduced FM signal 13c. The signal      switching circuit (2) 18 is switched by a switching signal 17 shown in      FIG. 12(b) and derives a continuous reproduced FM signal 19 shown in FIG.      12(e) therefrom for supplying a continuous signal to a signal processing      circuit 23. </PAR><PAR>  The reproduced FM signal 19 is demodulated into a video signal at a      demodulator 20 and fed to a clamp circuit (1) 21 as a reproduced video      signal 43 for clamping. The clamped video signal is fed to an A/D      converter 24 as a video signal 44 shown in FIG. 12(f) being clamped to an      input level of the A/D converter 24 through another clamp circuit (2) 45.      The video signal 44 is digitized into a digital signal 25 at the A/D      converter 23 and fed to a memory unit 26. </PAR><PAR>  A memory unit control circuit 31 controls the sending out of the video      signal reproduced by the rotary head 5c in the duration of signal field      interval while writing it into the memory unit 26 and to replace in turn      the video signal reproduced by the pair of rotary heads 5a and 5b in the      duration of no-signal field interval with the stored video signal in the      preceding signal field interval by reading it from the memory unit 26. In      this way, the replaced video signal 32, all of which is reproduced by the      rotary head 5c as it is shown in FIG. 12(g), is converted into an analog      signal by a D/A converter 33 and is derived therefrom as a video signal      34. </PAR><PAR>  As seen, in accordance with this embodiment of the invention, since the      video signal 43 to be fed to the clamp circuit 21 is a continuous signal,      there are no sags in the video signal that passes through the clamp      circuit 21. Therefore, there are no intervals in the video signal at which      the vertical and horizontal synchronizing signals can not be separated      from the video signal in the synchronous separation circuit 22.      Accordingly, there is no disturbance in display. </PAR><PAR>  Further, in the embodiment of the invention described above, there is      mounted one pair of rotary heads 5a, 5b across the rotary drum 3 besides      the independent single head 5c, however, this is not limited to one pair      of rotary heads but a plurality of pairs of rotary heads may be mounted on      the rotary drum for the same purpose. </PAR><PAR>  Still further, there is shown the independent single rotary head 5c which      is fixed to the rotary drum 3 in the above described embodiment of the      present invention, however, the fixed rotary head 5c may be substituted by      a displaceable rotary head in order to trace recorded tracks under any      tape traveling speed by displacing the rotary head in the lateral      direction of the video tape. </PAR><PAR>  Another preferred embodiment of the invention will be described with      reference to the drawings of FIG. 13 through FIG. 15. Referring to FIG.      13, like reference numerals identify like elements in the foregoing,      wherein 22 denotes a first synchronous separation circuit, 35 denotes a      read control circuit, 37 denotes a write control circuit for the memory      unit 26, 46 denotes a second clamp circuit and 48 denotes a second      synchronous separation circuit. </PAR><PAR>  In operation, a reproduced FM signal 13c reproduced by a single rotary head      5c and amplified by an amplifier 12c shown in FIG. 14(d) is fed to a      signal switching circuit (2) 18 and reproduced FM signals 13a, 13b      reproduced by a pair of rotary heads 5a, 5b and amplified by amplifiers      12a, 12b are fed to a signal switching circuit (1) 14 for being switched      by a switching signal 16 shown in FIG. 14(a) to yield a continuous signal      which is shown as a reproduced FM signal 15 in FIG. 14(c). The reproduced      FM signal 15 is then fed to the signal switching circuit (2) 18 together      with the reproduced FM signal 13c. The signal switching circuit (2) 18 is      switched by a switching signal 17 shown in FIG. 14(b) to derive a      reproduced FM signal 19 shown in FIG. 14(e) therefrom by inserting the      reproduced FM signal 15 into a no-signal field interval of the reproduced      FM signal 13c. This reproduced FM signal 19 is demodulated into a video      signal 43 shown in FIG. 14(f) by a demodulator 20 and then fed to a clamp      circuit 21 for clamping a tip end level of the synchronizing signal to a      predetermined level. In this case, since the reproduced video signal 43 is      a continuous signal, there are no sags even after passing through the      clamp circuit 21. </PAR><PAR>  The clamped video signal 44 is fed to the synchronous separation circuit 22      as well as an A/D converter 24. Consequently, a synchronizing signal 30      separated from the video signal 44 at the synchronous separation circuit      22 is fed to the write control circuit 37 and a video signal 25 digitized      at the A/D converter 24 is fed to a memory unit 26. </PAR><PAR>  Referring now to FIG. 15, the write control circuit 37 discriminates a      signal field interval and no-signal field interval of the reproduced FM      signal 13c based on a switching signal 17 shown in FIG. 15(a) and controls      writing into the memory unit 26 to start with a point WR in FIG. 15 in      synchronized with the first horizontal synchronizing pulse 50 in the      signal field interval as it is shown in FIG. 15. The writing and reading      are repeated with a repetition rate of sampling in a duration of      write/read interval W/R. </PAR><PAR>  A video signal 32 being read from the memory unit 26 is converted into an      analog video signal 34 by a D/A converter 33 and fed to the clamp circuit      46 for clamping a tip level of the synchronizing signal thereof to a      predetermined level. The synchronizing signal 49 separated from the      clamped video signal 47 at the synchronous separation circuit 48 is then      fed to the read control circuit 35. The read control circuit 35      discriminates the signal field interval and the no-signal field interval      basing on the switching signal 17 and controls reading of the stored video      signal in the preceding signal field from the memory unit 26 to start with      a point RR in FIG. 15 which is exactly 1 H period apart from the last      horizontal synchronizing pulse shown at a point LH in FIG. 15 in the      signal field interval. The reading is continued in a duration of read      interval R. </PAR><PAR>  Accordingly, the reproduced video signal 34 attained by the above described      write/read control can maintain the continuity of the horizontal      synchronizing signal such as 1 H period at the boundary of the signal      field interval and the no-signal field interval regardless of a type of      scanning of the reproduced video signal 43 whether or not the scanning is      interlaced as it is shown in FIG. 15(c) and there provided is a display      with no disturbance in the synchronization. </PAR><PAR>  Still another preferred embodiment of the invention will be described with      reference to FIG. 16 through FIG. 19 wherein like numerals designate like      elements in the foregoing. Referring first to FIG. 16, there is shown a      schematic diagram of this embodiment of the invention in block from,      wherein 5a and 5b denote displaceable rotary heads mounted across a rotary      drum 3, 700 denotes a rotary drum control circuit, 79 denotes an input for      an adjusting signal to adjust a range of the rotary heads displacement, 78      denotes a video signal reproducing circuit for deriving a reproduced video      signal 120 from an output terminal 90 thereof, 80 denotes a capstan for      driving a magnetic video tape 2 to travel cooperatively with a pinch      roller 82 pressed thereto, 81 denotes a capstan motor, 84 denotes a rotary      pulse generator arranged in parallel with the capstan motor 81 for      deriving rotary pulses 100 from an output terminal 85 thereof and 86      denotes a tape phase standard signal generator arranged in contact with      the traveling magnetic video tape 2 for deriving a tape phase standard      signal 113, which has been recorded on the magnetic video tape with a      frame period, from an output 87 thereof. A pseudo-vertical synchronizing      signal generator 900 generates a pseudo-vertical synchronizing signal 112      in such a phase as being related to the tape phase standard signal of the      traveling magnetic tape 2. </PAR><PAR>  A signal composition circuit 1000 combines the reproduced video signal 120      with the pseudo-vertical signal 112 for deriving a composite video signal      121 from an output terminal 91 thereof. Now referring to FIG. 17, there is      shown a detailed block diagram of the rotary drum control circuit 700 in      accordance with the embodiment of the invention shown in FIG. 16, wherein      61a and 61b denote periodic signal generators for generating periodic      signals which differs 180 degrees in phase under the control of a      switching signal 114. The switching signal 114 is generated by a switching      signal generator 77 by detecting a mechanical position of the rotary drum      3 with use of a permanent magnet 75 mounted on the rotary drum 3 and a      position detecting head 76. Outputs of the periodic signal generators 61a      and 62 b are fed to drive circuits 600a and 600b each of which is composed      of an operational amplifier 64, a differential amplifier 69, an electric      current limiter 65, resistors 62, 63, 68 and 70, and a capacitor 71.      Outputs of the drive circuits 600a, 600b or control currents for the      displaceable rotary heads 5a, 5b are fed to drive coils 42a, 42b of the      drive unit 40 through respective contacts 52a, 52b and electrodes 53a,      53b. Non-control side terminals of the drive coils 42a, 42b are connected      in common and then connected to a standard potential through a pair of      common electrodes 53c and contacts 52c. </PAR><PAR>  Magnetic fields to be generated by the drive coils 42a, 42b when the      control currents flow therethrough displace the displaceable rotary heads      5a, 5b respectively by developing a magnetic repulsion against each      cylindrical permanent magnet that constitutes the drive unit 40. An amount      of the displacement is controlled in such a manner that head tracing      tracks A5 in the play-back conform to recorded tracks on the video tape 2.      The control currents are also fed to the drive coils 42a, 42b while the      rotary heads 5a, 5b are not in contact with the video tape 2. Playback      signals by the rotary heads 5a, 5b are fed to head amplifiers 72a, 72b      through upper and lower transformers 7, 8 and outputs of the head      amplifiers 72a, 72b are fed in turn to the video signal reproducing      circuit 78 for deriving a reproduced video signal 120 therefrom after      being switched by a switch 73 under the control of a swiching signal 114. </PAR><PAR>  Operation of the drive circuits 600a, 600b will now be described more in      detail. Since the drive circuit 600a and the drive circuit 600b are the      same in structure and operate in the same manner with 180 degrees phase      difference, the description will be made only for the drive circuit 600a. </PAR><PAR>  In accordance with this embodiment of the invention, there provided are      such condition as that (resistance of the resistor 63)andgt;(resistance of the      resistor 70), and (impendance of the capacitor 71)andgt;(resistance of the      drive coil 42). The drive circuit 600a has two feed back loops, one of      which is a current feed back via the differential amplifier 69 which      detects and feeds back a voltage across the resistor 68 (proportional to      the drive current that flows through the drive coil 42a) interposed in the      control line while the other of which is a voltage feed back loop via the      capacitor 71. </PAR><PAR>  When a frequency of the periodic signal is high, an impedance of the      capacitor 71 approaches to 0 and the voltage feed back loop gets control      over the current feed back loop, resulting in the voltage drive operation.      On the other hand, when a frequency of the periodic signal is low, an      impedance of the capacitor 71 approaches .infin. and the current feed back      loop gets control over the voltage feed back loop, resulting in the      current drive operation. The relationship between a fundamental drive      frequency for the rotary head 5a, which rotates simultaneously with the      drive coil 42a, and a mechanical resonance frequency of the drive unit 40      is given by an inequality of (fundamental drive frequency)andlt;(mechanical      resonance frequency). Hence, the current drive operation is performed at      least in the vicinity of the fundamental drive frequency whilst the      voltage drive operation is performed for a short-circuit control at least      in the vicinity of the mechanical resonance frequency. </PAR><PAR>  Further, in order to eliminate a difference in gains at the times of the      voltage drive operation and the current drive operation, the following      circuit constants are selected in this embodiment of the invention:      ##EQU1## </PAR><PAR>  The electric current limiter 65 which is composed of a window comparator 66      and a current limiting element 67 detects a voltage across the resistor 68      (proportional to a current that flows through the drive coil 42a) and      limits a control current to make the displacement of the displaceable      rotary head 5a to fulfill an inequality of andlsqb;.vertline.required      speed-1.vertline..times.track pitch Pandlt;displace limitandlt;structural displace      limit of the displaceable rotary head 5aandrsqb;. That is, the electric current      limiter 65 and the differential amplifier for current feed back are      operated simultaneously with a voltage across the resistor 68. </PAR><PAR>  Operation of the pseudo-vertical synchronizing signal generator circuit 900      will be described more specifically with reference to FIG. 18. A number of      rotary pulses 100 of the capstan motor 81 is proportional to a rotary      angle of the capstan 80 and consequently to an mount of traveling of the      magnetic video tape 2. The rotary pulses 100 and the tape phase standard      signal 113 detected from the traveling magnetic video tape 2 through the      tape phase standard signal detector 86 are fed to a tape phase detector      101 for counting the rotary pulses 100 by initializing the counting      periodically with the tape phase standard signal 113. Therefore, an output      of the tape phase detector 101 or a tape phase data 102 has a value      proportional to the phase of the traveling magnetic video tape 2. </PAR><PAR>  The tape phase data 102 is latched at a latch circuit 103 with an edge      pulse 116 of the head switching signal 114 being detected by an edge      detector 115 and the latched tape phase data 104 is then fed to a      processor 105. The processor 105 executes the following process:      ##EQU2##      and derives a processed data 106 therefrom. </PAR><PAR>  A delay unit 117 delays the edge pulse 116 and derives a delayed edge pulse      110 after a certain time Tc. A pseudo-vertical synchronizing signal timing      generator circuit 107 accepts the processed data 106 from the processor      105 when the delayed edge pulse 110 is fed thereto and counts down the      accepted processed data 106 upon receipt of every clock pulse 119 for      deriving a borrow signal 108 therefrom upon reaching 0 in counting. A      generation timing of the borrow signal 108 becomes a generation start      timing of the pseudo-vertical synchronizing signal 112 to be generated by      a pulse generator 109. The borrow signal 108 is assured a pulse width as a      vertical signal by the pulse generator 109 and taken out as the      pseudo-vertical synchronizing signal 112. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to FIG. 19, FIG. 19 is a timing chart for the waveforms at      various parts of the embodiment of the invention shown in FIG. 18 in the      mode of V1/2 speed slow-motion playback illustrating the relationship      amongst the head switching signal 114, the tape phase standard signal 113,      the tape phase data 102, the latched tape phase data 104 and the      pseudo-vertical synchronizing signal 112. In the case of V1/2 speed      slow-motion playback, one period of the tape phase standard signal 113      corresponds to two periods of the head switching signal 114. </PAR><PAR>  Since the tape phase data 102 is attained by counting the rotary pulses 100      from the capstan as being initialized periodically by the tape phase      standard signal 113, the wave form of the tape phase data 102 (D/A      converted) is given by a solid line in FIG. 19(c). Further, the wave form      of the latched tape phase data 104 latched by the both edges of the head      switching signal 114 is given by a dotted line in FIG. 19(c). </PAR><PAR>  A time T of the pseudo-vertical synchronizing signal 112 from the switch      over point of the rotary heads is given by:      ##EQU3##      where Tc is the delay time given by the delay unit 117. </PAR><PAR>  As it has been described above, the pseudo-vertical synchronizing signal is      generated with such a phase as being related to the tape speed to be      combined with the reproduced video signal. There is provided a VTR which      can display a stable image with no jitter under any tape traveling speed      that includes not only a slower but a faster traveling speed than the      normal tape traveling speed V1 because of the fact that the phase of the      pseudo-vertical synchronizing signal can always be maintained in constant      with respect to that of the reproduced video signal in accordance with      this specific embodiment of the invention. </PAR><PAR>  In the foregoing specification, the invention has been described with      reference to the specific embodiments thereof, it will, however, be      evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereunto      without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the      appended claims. The specification and the drawings are, accordingly, to      be regarded in an illustrative rather than in a restrictive sense. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
