(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Gina SmithandM;IBM may have killed its rumored &quot;PM Lite&quot; project last fall, but at least twoof its development partners are bringing parts of the effort back to life.andM;IBM conceived the subset of Presentation Manager for DOS, known as PM Lite,more than a year ago, but never announced it and abandoned the plans shortlybefore Comdex/Fall 1989.andP;  Once earmarked for a future DOS release, PM Litewas supposed to bring even 8088-based PCs a multitasking, graphical interfacethat could run most existing DOS and OS/2 PM applications.andM;The computer giant, according to sources inside and close to IBM, worked forsix months with several small third-party developers until the projectcollapsed under pressure from Microsoft Corp. and internal dissent inNovember.andM;Now, two of IBM's PM Lite partners -- Cyco International and GeoWorks Inc. --andO;are readying products that incorporate some of PM Lite's planned OS/2-DOScompatibility and multitasking features.andM;GeoWorks this fall will release GeoDOS, a multitasking graphical environmentthat runs on machines with as little as 512K bytes of RAM, sources close tothe Berkeley, Calif., company said.andM;Cyco in August will begin shipping Autobase, a graphical database-managementsystem for AutoCAD that includes a PM interface running on DOS, sourcesadded.andP;  Cyco already includes this technology in Auto Manager, an AutoCADfile-management system it released last summer.andM;The impending releases represent a rebirth of technology that was at the eyeof one of the most polarizing storms to sweep through the PC industry lastyear.andM;Cyco and GeoWorks, working separately, showed early versions of theirproducts to IBM officials in the spring of last year, sources said, andsubsequently convinced some IBM officials that the technologies could helplow-end, DOS-based PCs run sophisticated PM applications unmodified.andM;IBM enlisted the aid of both firms and some others.andP;  The development effortcontinued until October, when reports of it reached Microsoft and IBMofficials opposed to bringing a third graphical environment to the PCplatform, sources said.andP;  Many Microsoft officials considered the PM Liteproject a clear threat to its $100 million investment in Windows 3.0, theyadded.andM;Weeks later, at Comdex, the two companies held a surprise press conference atwhich IBM, for the first time, publicly endorsed Windows and said it wouldnot offer a subset of PM for DOS.andP;  Both companies recommended Windows forlow-end systems with 2M bytes of memory or less and OS/2 PM for systems with4M bytes or more.andP;  Microsoft also promised not to add to Windows several ofOS/2's advanced features such as &quot;multithreading&quot; or support for long filenames.andM;&quot;In my opinion, a year ago [PM Lite] would have taken off like a bat out ofhell,&quot; said Bill Stuebe, support supervisor of commercial sales at ZenithData Systems in Chicago.andM;IBM and Microsoft officials declined to comment on the PM Lite developmenteffort or the forthcoming products from GeoWorks and Cyco.andM;Some of PM Lite's reported features are about to surface in GeoWorks' GeoDOS,sources said.andP;  The environment will reportedly allow true, or pre-emptive,multitasking, and run multithreaded applications on low-end PCs.andM;GeoDOS will run unmodified DOS applications, and also will allow developersto create GeoDOS-specific applications that take advantage of itsobject-oriented interface and tools, said sources who've seen early versionsof the product.andP;  GeoWorks officials declined to comment.andM;Lotus Development Corp. is one of several developers reportedly consideringsupport for the environment.andP;  &quot;If a product offers a CUA-style interface,thrives on small memory, is written in assembler and can run on the hugenumber of low-end machines out there, we'd have to be interested,&quot; said FrankIngari, general manager and vice president of Lotus' PC spreadsheet divisionin Cambridge, Mass.andP;  He declined to comment on reports of Lotus' plans forGeoDOS.andM;While GeoWorks is leveraging its technology in the systems-softwaremarketplace, Cyco is bringing its PM technology to the applications market.andM;Cyco officials refused to comment on their role in IBM's PM Lite developmenteffort, but confirmed plans to release Autobase, which includes more than 250PM graphics program calls that run under either DOS or OS/2.andM;Central to the Autobase product is translation software that allows PM callsto execute on DOS, officials said.andP;  Cyco, of Atlanta, will also use thesoftware to make the product's PM-based interface run on Sun MicrosystemsInc.'s SunView graphical environment later this year, officials said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
