The government also put border guards on alert to prevent theescape of China's leading dissident, Fang Lizhi, and his wife, LiShuxian, who were accused of counterrevolutionary propaganda but noton the wanted list. They were in hiding at the U.S. Embassy inBeijing.   Among the students on the wanted list was Wu'er Kaixi, who toldPremier Li Peng in a televised meeting in May that he should ``stopbeating around the bush'' because China faced a political crisis.   The television report also showed footage taken by a hiddencamera of the charismatic student leader and friends eating at a``high-class hotel'' and U.S. TV footage of him addressing ralliesfor democracy and a freer society.   Li, who played a leading role in crushing the seven weeks ofprotests, told a meeting of top officials Tuesday the army had wononly an ``initial victory'' when it cleared student demonstratorsfrom Tiananmen Square on June 3-4.   ``At present our task is to restore order and strike relentlessblows at the counterrevolutionary rebels,'' the official Xinhua NewsAgency quoted Li as saying.   Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence sources say as many as3,000 people were killed when the government turned army troops onunarmed residents. The Chinese government has said nearly 300 peopledied, mostly soldiers.   Streets adjoining Tiananmen Square were reopened to car andbicycle traffic Tuesday, although no stopping was allowed andpedestrians remained barred.   Missing from the meeting with Li were Communist Party chief ZhaoZiyang and high-level party official Hu Qili, moderates whoreportedly opposed the crackdown and were stripped of their power byconservatives led by senior leader Deng Xiaoping.   Li also said China would not yield to foreign pressure to changeits policy toward the protesters.   ``We hope that all countries that wish to keep and developfriendly relations with China will take a long-term view and avoiddoing anything to hurt the feelings of the Chinese people,'' he said.   Many countries, including the United States, have condemned Chinafor ordering its army to fire on the students and supporters.Several countries have recalled their ambassadors in protest, butnone has broken ties.   In Washington, the Bush administration indicated it won't allowFang and his wife to be arrested. International law forbids Chineseauthorities from entering the embassy compound, which is regarded asAmerican soil, without U.S. permission.   Fang, an astrophysicist, did not play an active role in thepro-democracy movement. But he has long been an outspoken humanrights advocate, criticizing Marxism and China's top leaders.   Even before the army action, many top student leaders went intohiding. The Beijing Daily newspaper reported Tuesday that somestudent leaders had surrendered, but it gave no names.   The government wanted list indicated none of the top leaders haddone so. In addition to Wu'er, it included Beijing Universityhistory student Wang Dan and Chai Ling, one of only two women on thelist, who sent a tape from hiding that was broadcast last week byCBS News.   The list accused the 21 students of ``inciting and organizingcounterrevolutionary rebellion in Beijing,'' and contained detailsabout their height, hair and other features.   Chinese television has more than doubled its usual 30-minute newsprogram on recent nights to show the arrests of more than 1,000workers and unemployed youth nationwide for alleged participation inanti-government demonstrations.   The government announced the arrest of a second Hong Kongresident in connection with the protests.   Guangdong provincial radio in the southeast said Guo Wenshen wasarrested in Shaoguan city after posting ``reactionary slogans'' onpoles. Another Hong Kong student was arrested at the Shanghaiairport on Sunday and accused of leading an illegal studentorganization.   The government regards Chinese residents of Hong Kong as Chinesecitizens, even though Britain will not return the colony to Chinauntil 1997.   In the first official indication of possible discontent withinthe army, Jilin provincial radio reported that soldiers of anunidentified army unit had pledged in writing to ``learn from troopssupporting the crackdown'' and to ``abide by orders.''   The radio report, monitored by the BBC, did not say what promptedthe written pledges. There were small skirmishes last week betweentroops carrying out the crackdown and soldiers opposed to it, butthere was no large-scale opposition and by week's end the army gavean appearance of unity.   The army's presence in Beijing remained strong Tuesday.   More than 50 tanks and armored personnel vehicles remained parkedat the north and south ends of Tiananmen Square, and soldiers withrifles stood every 15 feet along the plaza's perimeter.   Beijing Radio advised residents not to talk with soldiers, whohave been told they can use their weapons in self-defense and shootor take any other measures necessary to stop criminal activity.</TEXT></DOC>
