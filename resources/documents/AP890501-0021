COLEMAN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The fate of a man who held hospital workers atbay as he disconnected his comatose son from a life-support machineis at the heart of a controversy over laws governing hopelessly illchildren.   Rudy Linares has been released on bail after being charged withfirst-degree murder for removing his severely brain-damaged,16-month-old son from a life-support system.   A tearful Linares, the father of two other children, cradled theboy in his arms Wednesday until the child died.   The boy was to be buried today in a private service at which hisfather was expected to attend.   Prosecutors, the hospital and the boy's doctor contend that lawsprohibit anyone from disconnecting mechanical life support, evenfrom severely brain-damaged youngsters who are not expected to everrecover.   On the other side are defense lawyers and other physicians andattorneys who argue that the same laws, along with court rulingsand accepted practice, protect doctors and parents from criminalliability when they decide to end futile treatment.   ``It is our fervent hope that a case like this doesn't become aprecedent or a landmark, because the issues are so unclear, theyare so murky at this point,'' said Richard Scholz, the publicdefender for Linares.   Linares, 23, a house painter from suburban Cicero, and his21-year-old wife, Tamara, had requested months ago thatlife-support be withdrawn from their son, Samuel, who swallowed aballoon at a birthday party in August and almost suffocated. Buthospital officials say the family did not seek the required courtorder.   Despite extensive medical efforts to revive him when theaccident occurred, the boy was ``definitely in a state ofirreversible vegetative coma,'' said his physician, Dr. GilbertGoldman. ``My opinion was that recovery was not possible.''   But there was no legal precedent for turning off the respiratorthat kept Samuel alive, said Goldman, director of pediatricintensive care at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center.   Max Brown, a hospital lawyer, said Goldman and the hospitalcould have left themselves open to prosecution under Illinoischild-abuse laws or, worse, been charged with murdering the boy.   ``He was not brain-dead,'' Brown said. ``He was not deadaccording to any legally or medically accepted criteria.''   Such a criterion is not required under any existing laws, saidFenella Rouse, legal director of the Society for the Right to Diein New York City.   ``In a case like this for a child, withdrawing ventilatorsupport is not the least bit controversial,'' she said in atelephone interview Friday.   Courts in Florida, Michigan and Georgia have supported thedecisions of parents to end life-support in such cases, Ms. Rousesaid, and ``most importantly, nobody has ruled to the contrary.''   Moreover, Linares is wrongly charged with murder fordisconnecting his son from the ventilator, she said.   ``There's no doubt about it _ it's legal. It's just as legal forthe father to do it as for the hospital to do it,'' she said.   Ms. Rouse noted that murder charges in a 1983 California caseagainst two physicians who withdrew life-support from an adult manwere struck down.   ``I think it's conceivable he could be charged with trespass, orillegal use of a handgun, or threatening behavior, but as far as Iunderstand criminal law, he cannot be charged with something likethis,'' she said of Linares.   Prosecutors disagree.   ``Under no circumstances does any person have the right to takethe life of another,'' said Cook County State's Attorney Cecil A.Partee, who added he could understand the emotions of a distraughtparent in such a case.   The Linares family had been advised early about the possibilityof obtaining an order in Cook County Circuit Court for the hospitalto disconnect the ventilator, and the hospital would have beensupportive, Brown said.   ``Why they did not do that, I don't know,'' he said.   Dr. Stanley Schade, chief of hematology at the University ofIllinois Hospital and chairman of its ethics committee, said somelegal authorities would say a court order is necessary forwithdrawal of life-support, but he believes dealing with the nextof kin is sufficient.   But Brown said that just because something is done doesn't meanit is legal.   ``We don't like to be in the center of the storm like this, butwe are following the law and abiding by the law,'' he said. ``Iwill be glad to change our hospital procedures, but the law has tobe changed first.''</TEXT></DOC>
