Nonetheless,nuclear policy remains an area in which the contrary interests of manycountries clash. In the dilemma between the peaceful and military-relateduse of nuclear energy, the Federal Republic of Germany is also in a conflictingsituation. Although the problem of non-proliferation will ot be solvedfor some time to come, it has been remedied in one important aspect.The peaceful uses of nuclear power are under (almost) air-tight supervisionby international agreements enforced by IAEA control. Any country intendingto use nuclear power for military purposes will not be able to do soclandestinely but only by an open breach of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.</TEXT></DOC>
