Hansen didn't dig up these scores. It was the work ofanother man: Bish.;   Yes, Bish strikes again.;   You may not know Ken Bishopby the pet name one of my predecessors stuck on him. You may not know him atall. But if you have gone to your share of Mission Valley Athletic Leaguefootball, baseball or boys' basketball games in the past six years, you'veseen him.;   Bishop, 49, is the guy walking the sidelines at Tak FudennaStadium wearing short pants on those balmy, 40-degree nights. He's the guy whoshows up at basketball games in sweat pants and an outdated San FranciscoGiants warmup jacket with &quot;BISHOP&quot; stitched on the back.;   All the while,Bishop, a longtime Fremont resident, is working. In newspaper jargon, Bishopis a &quot;stringer,&quot; someone hired by a paper to cover events on a free-lancebasis. Bishop strings for a pair of Bay Area papers and is seemingly at everyhigh school event in the East Bay.;   By his own calculations, he has covered213 football games in the past four years and has seen all but two East Bayschools, Valley View Christian of Dublin and Liberty of Brentwood, playfootball or basketball. He says he works six nights a week.;   For all hisefforts, Bishop estimates that he makes $175 a week. So this must either be alabor of love or the only thing available, right?;   &quot;It's the only thingavailable,&quot; he said. . . . &quot;We're not getting by, but we're making it. Well,we're barely getting by.&quot;;   &quot;I probably spend over $200 a month on gas,&quot; hesaid. &quot;I drive about 400 miles a week to watch basketball.&quot;;   Covering highschool sports is a far cry from Bishop's previous job, as a secretary toformer Oakland Raiders Coach John Madden and as an administrative assistantfor the Raiders.;   After a two-year stint in the Army, Bishop, who grew up inPalo Alto, began working for the Raiders in the late 1960s and didn't stopuntil the team skipped town and resettled in Los Angeles in 1982.;   Bishopsaid he was asked to move south with the team but decided that working hisusual noon-5:30 a.m. shifts in another location wasn't worth it.;   &quot;My lastwords were, 'Fog, not smog. Fog, not smog,&quot; he said.;   After the Raiderssplit, Bishop &quot;kind of dropped out.&quot; He worked in the dry cleaning businesswith his wife, Marilyn, in 1985. When that didn't work out, he resurfaced ayear later covering high school sports.;   Prep sportswriters in the East Bayprobably didn't know what they were in for. Bishop is legendary for callingsportswriters and talking for hours, whether the sportswriter is talking backor not. Just where did he get this gift of gab?;   &quot;I don't think Inecessarily have one,&quot; he said. &quot;To me, it's communication. I don't think alot of people communicate very good these days, and I think I do.&quot;;   Headded, &quot;I think I flabbergast or overwhelm people with my sincerity, interestor trivia. Sometimes, they don't want to deal with it.&quot;;   Most of thesportswriters Bishop deals with are half his age and normally have no ideawhat he's talking about when he goes on about some game from 1965.;   He said,&quot;I feel like I get a lot of looks that are misunderstood, like 'What's thisolder person doing hanging out on a younger person's beat?' Or 'How did he gofrom the pros to the preps?' It was simple. My team left town and I needed thejob.&quot;;   Bishop said he'll continue to cover high school sports for now, butadded that he'd like to return to the professional ranks in a public relationscapacity.;   &quot;My 13 years with the Raiders speaks for itself,&quot; he said.;  Maybe so, but here's some advice for hooking up with a pro team: Improve thedress, Bish. That Giants jacket, which Bishop said was given to him by formerGiants pitching coach Don McMahon in 1980, is better off in the closet. Andwhat's with the shorts at night?;   &quot;I got that from John Madden,&quot; Bishopsaid. &quot;He said you should try to be loose at work and unencumbered.&quot;;   Looseand unencumbered. In a nutshell, that's Bish.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Scott Vigallon column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Alameda County/Am  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911225  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  11  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  784  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, December 25, 199100360275,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
