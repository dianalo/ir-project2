Frost and freeze advisories extendedover Michigan to South Carolina.

Then I heard it. If you hear thatsound, you get right with your maker in a hurry. It'll put a fearin a grown man.''   In hardest-hit North Carolina, Tom Ditt of the EmergencyManagement Office said 17 counties reported 166 homes andbusinesses destroyed and 182 seriously damaged. The storms alsodamaged or destroyed 79 farm buildings.   Schools were closed today in Winston-Salem and Forsyth Countybecause some buildings had no power.
