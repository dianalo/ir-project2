 It's all the more difficult when the task encompasses fivemillion documents recorded over two centuries.andM;&quot;We started off in a very deep hole,&quot; acknowledges Tom Giammo, assistantcommissioner for information systems at the U.S.andP;  Patent and TrademarkOffice, which is in the midst of putting millions of patent documents ontooptical disks.andP;  The holes don't come much blacker than the one in which thePTO found itself after its Automated Patent System (APS) was ripped upward,backward, sideways, and down for being light-years behind schedule andmillions of dollars over budget.andM;That was a whole year ago, however.andP;  Since then the PTO has not only climbedout of the hole to where it can see the light--it appears as if the $300million APS actually will do the job.andM;&quot;We've gone from being on a yo-yo to an extremely stable environment wherethe major cause of our problems are power failures,&quot;  Giammo says, claimingthat patent information stored on disks today can be retrieved nearly 99% ofthe time--up from 90% a year ago.andP;  &quot;The users have gone from being verydissatisfied to being very satisfied with the functionality of the system.andO;To them it probably seems like it all happened in three weeks.andP;  They don'tsee the amount of work that went into making things right.&quot;andM;Things were always right with the PTO's text retrieval system, created byChemical Abstract Services Inc., Columbus, Ohio, which allowed patentexaminers to call up written histories of previous patents.andP;  But things weremostly wrong with Planning Research Corp.'s proposed image search system,intended to allow examiners to see pictures and diagrams of certain classesof patents.andP;  An ongoing evaluation of the system was based on whether itresponded in a reasonable time to a search request and whether the pagesneeded by an examiner were available.andM;What Went WrongandM;The rapid access devices (RADs) were experiencing extremely high failurerates.andP;  Told by Giammo that the PTO was on desolation row and &quot;there was noway I was going to sink while you were going to swim,&quot; Planning ResearchCorp., the prime contractor, and Falcon Systems, the main subcontractor, gottheir act together and improved the focusing mechanism for the optical diskafter the image search system had been put in place.andP;  The error rate forfetching images from the RADs has since dropped from 1,500 a day to less than10.andM;Two more releases of the system's main functional software have beengenerated, and they're defined and are right on the money.andP;  Version 5 will beon line at the end of March.andP;  Version 6 will arrive at the end of this fiscalyear.andP;  Both will incorporate changes that will add considerably to thesystem's performance without disrupting the existing dataflow.andP;  The changeswill be bundled, which experience has taught the PTO is a far better way todo business than testing each increment separately.andP;  The new networktechnology is also humming along quite nicely.andP;  It too is being integratedinto the current scheme without disturbing it.andM;They're still impatient in patents, however.andP;  The agency's new worry is theworkstations attached to the image system.andP;  The screens on the Gould machinesdon't meet the quality standards the PTO wants for the 150-dot-per-inch scanof the patent page originals.andP;  Instead of ordering mass quantities, the PTOis procuring the workstations piecemeal.andP;  It's currently using about 50machines, and would like to purchase another 75 for extending the test bed tothe next group of examiners.andP;  But the PTO is reluctant to commit moneywithout an improvement in quality.andM;Workstation WorriesandM;&quot;The workstations have been the most troublesome component,&quot; admits Giammo,who expects an eventual 3:1 user-to-machine ratio.andP;  &quot;The displays have nevermet the specs, so we've got a problem if we continue to buy the equipment wealready have.andP;  But do you have them reengineer so they can meet the specs ordo you start a reprocurement?andP;  By then the technology is four years old, andthey've already got chips to replace the boards.andP;  The next chunk seems likeawfully big dollars for what will be obsolete technology.&quot;andM;No matter what their age, workstations are still the heart and soul of theimage retrieval system.andP;  When the system is fully deployed, it will functionas follows.andP;  As examiner will pull the indices for the image system, whichwill have been burned onto the optical disks.andP;  The workstation will ask thePTO's NEC mainframe where the image is located.andP;  The mainframe will respondand the workstation will send the message over the network to the RAD.andP;  TheRAD will then fetch the image and send it back to the workstation, at whichpoint the examiner is in business.andP;  This final link in the seeminglyinterminable APS chain is scheduled to happen at the start of fiscal year1991 (Oct.andP;  1, 1990), but Giammo thinks it may occur earlier.andM;&quot;It actually was fairly easy to get out of tha hole because a lot of thefundamental work had been done,&quot; Giammo says.andP;  &quot;But this is still aworld-class problem, and it's going to be very difficult to get to aworld-class operation.andM;&quot;Our biggest obstacles are still money and credibility.andP;  I know OMB peoplethink we faked the numbers, and the suspicion is 'is this real?'andP;  Yes, it is.andO;We've resolved all the major areas of uncertainty, so nothing's standing inthe way of making major progress.andP;  I get unbelievably impressed with thethings we've already done.andP;  Then I look at the things we still have to do andI feel really small and insignificant.andP;  There's still a lot to be done.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
