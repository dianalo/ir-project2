The 1990 budget that President Reagan sent to Congress on Mondayprojects the new tax law will add $24.4 billion to the deficit thisfiscal year and $20.3 billion in the year that begins Oct. 1. Itresulted in an $8.9 billion loss in 1988.   A Congressional Budget Office specialist this week disputed theTreasury calculations. CBO's figures, which are expected in a fewdays, will show a far smaller revenue loss over five years. Theofficial said CBO's estimates are supported by the Joint Committeeon Taxation, which advises Congress on tax matters.   ``In 1992 and 1993, we believe the new law will increasecollections by between $5 billion and $10 billion a year,'' said theCBO official, who would not be quoted by name.   ``Looking even further into the future, it's going to berevenue-neutral,'' meaning it will produce the same revenue that theold law would have in those years, the CBO source said.   The Treasury Department offered no official explanation of whyits new estimates differ so widely from earlier calculations.   However, one Treasury aide suggested the problem is that the newestimates have no way of accounting for higher incomes that manyeconomists think resulted from the lower tax rates under the new law.   This explanation is based on the concept that underlies Reagan'seconomic policies: that cutting tax rates induces people to workhard, earn more and save more. Those higher incomes, in turn, wouldproduce more revenue for the government.   During the nearly two years it took Congress to write the law,leaders of the House, Senate and administration always agreed on onepoint: no matter what went into the new tax package, the totalresult should neither raise nor lower total government taxcollections.   On several occasions, lawmakers had to amend their work becauserevenue experts indicated it would have lost money,   Shortly after the law was enacted, Congress and the TreasuryDepartment estimated that in the five budget years from 1987 through1991, it would produce $300 million less in total revenue than theold law would have _ a figure low enough to be consideredrevenue-neutral.   But a year ago, Reagan's budget indicated that loss would be$23.2 billion.   The new budget more than doubles the loss or the same five yearsto $48.5 billion. It projects a $90.9 billion loss for the fiveyears from 1988 through 1992.   When Reagan signed the new law, Congress and the administrationagreed the measure would increase tax collections by $11.5 billionin 1987, chiefly because owners of stocks and other investmentswould be induced to sell some assets in the closing days of 1986 toavoid a higher tax on capital gains that began in 1987.   In fact, the Treasury Department says, 1987 collections rose by$21.5 billion.   Congress and the Treasury Department often have found it is nextto impossible to project how changes in tax laws will affecttaxpayer behavior _ and thus revenue collections _ more than a yearor two into the future.   The problem with the 1986 law is even greater, because itincluded the most changes since the income tax was enacted in 1913.   In addition to cutting tax rates significantly for individualsand corporations, the law reduced or repealed several deductions andcredits and aimed to shift $120 billion of the tax burden fromindividuals to businesses over five years.   The CBO official said whatever shortage in revenue results fromthe new law will have been caused by overestimating taxes to begained by reducing individual deductions, rather than from the ratereduction.</TEXT></DOC>
