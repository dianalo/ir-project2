The purposewas to create a controlling method to optimize the gain as efficientlyas possible. The study was limited to the preliminary design phase ofa renovation project. An evaluation method to measure the changing valueof a building was developed using a prametrization of the features ofa building. The parameters were given numerical values to describe therelative importance of each feature. An optimization was done betweenthe various alternatives in renovating by comparing the results of theparametrization to the total renovation costs. An operational model formanaging the most advantageous alternative in renovating was presentedfor the preliminary design phase of a project. The model was exemplifiedby two case studies. They showed that the method is rather sensitiveto the variations in appraising the value of a building. The study resultedin a controlling method which optimizes the change of the value of abuilding against the total renovation costs. This method should be furtherdeveloped to take into account also the changes in the maintenance costsof the building caused by the renovation project.</TEXT></DOC>
