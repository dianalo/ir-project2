President P.W. Botha's third emergency proclamation Friday meanshundreds of prominent activists will remain in jail without charge.The decree tightened curbs on press coverage of opposition activityand made it illegal to promote a boycott of October municipalelections.   The government in February banned the activities of 17 majoranti-apartheid groups. Most of those groups have called on blacksto refrain from voting in elections held by the white-dominatedgovernment until blacks have equal voting rights on a nationallevel.   The Reagan administration, which had opposed imposition of toughsanctions against South Africa but was forced to act by Congress,had only a brief comment on the latest development.   ``This action underscores the need for a dialogue between thegovernment and the black opposition to bring about a fullyfunctioning non-racial democracy,'' said White House spokesmanMarlin Fitzwater.   The emergency, which first went into effect June 12, 1986, nowwill be extended for a year.   Botha's announcement of the extension came two days after blacksended their largest and longest general strike against thegovernment. Black labor federations said Friday that 2,000 workerswho joined the protest have been fired and 1,000 more subjected tovarious disciplinary actions.   Botha said the government hopes conditions will improve so thatthe emergency can be lifted.   But Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu said the emergencyextension ``is a pointless and bankrupt exercise'' which``aggravates South Africa's crisis.''   Helen Suzman, a veteran parliamentarian who opposes apartheid,said: ``We might just as well prepare ourselves for a permanentstate of emergency.''   The critics included Mangosuthu Buthelezi, chief minister of theKwaZulu semi-autonomous homeland and one of the black leaders whomPretoria wants to include in negotiations on a power-sharing systemthat would retain white rule.   ``The tragedy of the South African situation is that nobodyreally had any hope that the national state of emergency would belifted,'' he said. ``South Africa seems to be caught up in asituation (in) which dying apartheid requires more defense than itever required.''   The new regulations make it illegal to quote members of the 17banned anti-apartheid organizations and prohibit newspapers fromquoting any member of the outlawed African National Congressguerrilla movement.   The ANC is the main group fighting South Africa's government andapartheid, under which the nation's 26 million blacks have no voicein national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy andgovernment.   The regulations also forbid newspapers from saying that theirjournalists were ordered away from any scene of unrest andindicating in other ways that their news stories are incompletebecause of the emergency restrictions.   Another new section requires local news agencies, except for theSouth African Press Association _ the largest _ to register withthe government.   The small domestic news agencies, many of them aggressive intheir coverage of anti-apartheid activity, could be ordered tosubmit all their dispatches to a government censor beforepublication, the regulations say.   The new rules mean ``no information about very importantpolitical movements in the country will be available,'' said WynandMalan, former member of Botha's National Party who now leads aseparate movement in Parliament.   A vigil for the estimated 2,500 detainees currently held underthe emergency was conducted at Johannesburg's Central MethodistChurch. Monitoring groups said 500 to 1,000 of the detainees havebeen held for two years.   White women from the Black Sash civil rights group on Fridaystood along highways in Johannesburg with posters saying:``Apartheid is the emergency.''   The ANC said in a statement from its headquarters in Zambia thatthe government sought ``to ensure its survival by continuing toresort to the most brutal repression.'' The ANC called forcomprehensive, mandatory sanctions against South Africa and saidits guerrillas must escalate their attacks.   The government's Bureau for Information said the emergency had apositive effect. It said 91 percent of all black local governmentswere operating normally and 85 percent of the positions for blacktownship councilmen were full. Black school attendance was at 80percent, it said.   It gave no figures for unrest incidents, deaths and injuries.But they have been sharply down over the past year.</TEXT></DOC>
