 In this sectionof society, rules proliferate, lawsuits abound, and the cost of legalservices grows much faster than the cost of living.andP;  For the bulk of thepopulation, however, the situation is very different.andP;  Access to the courtsmay be open in principle.andP;  In practice, however, most people find their legalrights severely compromised by the cost of legal services, the bafflingcomplications of existing rules and procedures, and the long, frustratingdelays involved in bringing proceedings to a conclusion ...andP;  There is far toomuch law for those who can afford it and far too little for those who cannot.andO;No one can be satisfied with this state of affairs.andM;The American legal system is widely viewed as being in a state of crisis,plagued by excessive costs, long delays, and inconsistency leading to agrowing lack of public confidence.andP;  One reason for this is the vast amount ofinformation that must be collected and integrated in order for the legalsystem to function properly.andP;  In many traditional areas of law, evolvinglegal doctrines have led to uncertainty and increased litigation at a highcost to both individuals and society.andP;  And in discretionary areas such assentencing, alimony awards, and welfare administration, evidence has shown ahigh degree of inconsistency in legal decision making, leading to publicdissatisfaction and a growing demand for &quot;determinate&quot; rules.andM;In this article, we consider the potential of artificial intelligence tocontribute to a more fair and efficient legal system.andP;  First, using theexample of a middle income home buyer who was misled by the statements of areal estate broker, we show how a predictive expert system could help eachside assess its legal position.andP;  If expert systems were reasonably accuratepredictors, some disputes could be voluntarily settled that are now resolvedby costly litigation, and many others could be settled more quickly.andP;  We thenconsider the process of discretionary decision making, using the example of ajudge sentencing a criminal.andP;  We describe how diagnostic expert systemsdeveloped in the medical domain could be adapted to criminal sentencing, anddescribe a process by which this technology could be used--first to build aconsensus on sentencing norms, and then to make those norms accessible.andM;In the ideal case, legal decisions are made after lengthy study and debate,recorded in published justifications, and later scrutinized in depth by otherlegal experts.andP;  In contrast to this ideal, most day-to-day legal decisionsare made by municipal and state court judges, police officers, prosecutingattorneys, insurance claims adjusters, welfare administrators, socialworkers, and lawyers advising their clients on whether to settle or litigate.andO;These decisions must often be made under severe pressures of limited time,money, and information.andP;  Expert systems can provide decision makers withtools to better understand, evaluate and disseminate their decisions.andP;  At thesame time, it is important to reiterate that expert systems should not andcannot replace human judgement in the legal decision making process.andM;PREDICTIVE LEGAL EXPERT SYSTEMSandM;To assess the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in helping tostreamline the dispute resolution process, we analyze the hypothetical caseof an unfortunate middle income home buyer who responds to a real estatebroker's advertisement.andP;  The buyer complains to his attorney that during thebroker's showing of the house the buyer asked whether &quot;the house had waterproblems&quot; and the broker replied, &quot;Not to my knowledge.&quot;andP;  Several weeks afteracquiring the house for $150,000 a heavy rain storm resulted in significantwater accumulation in the basement.andP;  The buyer discovers that the floodingoccurred because the land on which his house is located has serious drainageproblems.andP;  To prevent a reocurrence will cost over $20,000.andP;  Afterdiscovering that the seller had moved away, the buyer called the broker whosaid that since &quot;he knew nothing about the potential water problems he feltno obligation to contribute to the cost of the repairs.&quot;andP;  After an hour'sconsultation with his attorney the buyer learns that his case is&quot;complicated,&quot; the chances of obtaining redress &quot;uncertain&quot; and the cost ofpursuing the claim will be at least $5,000.andP;  In a neighboring law office thebroker hears from his attorney that the &quot;law is in a state of flux.&quot;andO;Therefore, even though the broker's statement was truthful, the buyer stands&quot;a chance&quot; and that to defend a law suit may cost &quot;about $5,000.&quot;andM;Though many citizens have difficulty understanding why these parties cannotobtain a clear answer to what appears to be a relatively simple legalquestion, members of the legal community well understand that threepotentiating factors have greatly complicated our dispute resolutionprocesses.andP;  First, many new areas of law have emerged as society called uponits legal institutions to protect the environment, the rights of consumers,voters, minorities, the indigent, and criminals.andP;  Fifty years ago an attorneycould have given this buyer a rather straightforward answer--no legal reliefunless the broker lied.andP;  Today, the skilled lawyer knows that consumerprotection statutes and evolving judicial doctrines might provide the basisof recovery against an honest, but uninformed broker.andM;Secondly, framers of legal rules have often abandoned cleardirectivesin favorof open textured rules.andP;  Under traditional common law fraud principles thebroker would not have been liable unless he knew his statement was false.andO;Under a more modern view the broker is required &quot;to conduct a reasonablycompetent and diligent inspection of the residence.&quot;andP;  Litigation to determinewhat the broker &quot;knewc is generally less complex than judicial attempts tofix standards for &quot;a reasonably competend and diligent inspection&quot; and thento decide whether the broker satisfied these amorphous norms of professionalbehavior.andM;Thirdly, procedural rules were changed from a system where the pleadings ofthe parties narrowly framed the issues for trial to a system where lengthyand costly pre-trial discovery is required before the contours of thelitigation become known.andP;  Under the earlier procedural system that reliedheavily on pleadings the buyer would have alleged what transpired inconsiderable detail and then a trial would take place to see who was tellingthe truth.andP;  Today, the pleadings do not apprise the parties of the nature ofthe case and, therefore, lawyers must examine witnesses and documents beforetrial in order to learn what the case is about.andP;  In this particular case thelawyers, in addition to asking witnesses what transpired, might conduct apre-trial examination of expert witnesses to obtain their opinions on thekind of inspection this broker should have conducted.andP;  For all practicalpurposes litigants now must pay for two lengthy trials, the first to find outwhat the witnesses will say and the second to hear them repeat it.andP;  Granted,such a system minimizes surprise but at a significant increase in cost.andM;A Lawyer's Approach to the Case of the Home BuyerandM;Lawyers initially start with a factual inquiry to determine which broad areaof law applies to the problem before them.andP;  After a few minutes the lawyerlearns whether the problem involves a criminal or civil matter and shortlylearns that he or she will need to apply legal principles applicable to thesale of houses.andP;  And in a case such as this the lawyer, relying on trainingand experience, would seek rather precise descriptions of what the brokersaid and what the client observed.andM;Most lawyers understand the basic principles of fraud--had the brokerexpressly and falsely represented that the property had no water problemsthen the plaintiff's chances of recovery are great.andP;  Conversely, had thebroker said nothing and the buyer had seen water in the basement then hischances of victory would be nil because the law is unlikely to protect abuyer who failed totally to use his common sense.andP;  But once having sailedinto the right ocean the lawyer must draw on two kinds of specializedknowledge to navigate into the narrow channels of the inner harbor.andP;  First,he must determine what published legal rules will apply to the precise factshe discovers.andP;  Secondly, after having assembled the facts and the relevantlegal principles he must call upon his experience in determining whether acourt, after having considered these facts and legal principles, will find infavor of his client.andM;As the lawyer hears the facts from the client certain legal principles arecalled to mind and as the lawyer delves further into the law he then becomesaware of the relevance of certain facts.andP;  In our simple example, the lawyermight initially conclude that the doctrine of caveat emptor (&quot;let the buyerbeware&quot;) bars recovery.andP;  But as he studies the cases he will find that thebuyer might recover if the broker knew of potential water problems in thebasement.andP;  Then, as the lawyer gains more factual information, he might learnthat the client noticed a water line, a fact that might invoke a legal rulethat would exculpate the broker since the existence of a water line shouldhave alerted the buyer to the potential flooding.andP;  But since legal ruleschange, the buyer's lawyer might anticipate a court altering the legal rulesto hold that since brokers are experts in real estate they have a duty toexplain the meaning of the water line to a customer who lacks this kind ofspecialized knowledge.andM;The process of finding the law (including statutes, prior court cases,administrative rulings and procedural requirements) may involve searching adatabase of millions of potentially relevant documents.andP;  The proliferation oflegal documents is a major cause of the growing cost of legal services notedby Harvard President (and former law professor) Derek Bok.andP;  Furthermore, asthe chance of missing a relevant document increases, the legal status of acase becomes increasingly difficult to determine.andP;  Although still in itsinfancy, there is growing interest in using artificial intelligencetechniques to develop conceptual legal retrieval systems to assist the lawyerin more effectively utilizing this vast database.andM;Once having discovered the facts and found the relevant sources of law, thelawyer must predict the outcome.andP;  Unlike an engineer whose knowledge of rulesand facts engenders a confident prediction that a bridge will stand, lawyersoperate within an indeterminate system.andP;  Fact indeterminacy always clouds theadvice one gives to clients--a jury may believe either the buyer or thebroker.andP;  Or a jury may believe the broker but find for the plaintiff becausethey sympathize with his plight.andM;Nor can attorneys ever be sure that a court will decide that brokers whoeither speak truthfully or do not speak at all are liable for defects theymight have discovered had they made a diligent search, because accepted modesof legal reasoning support either side of this controversy.andP;  No court wouldbe deemed unreasonable to insist that brokers only be held liable for theirintentional misrepresentations.andP;  Conversely, a court might respond toplausible arguments that the broker should be held liable for innocent butcareless representations.andP;  First, his expertise enables him to spot potentialdefects that would elude the eye of the inexperienced purchaser.andP;  Secondly,as businessmen brokers can better absorb the losses of the few individualbuyers who sustain injury by spreading these losses evenly over all theircustomers.andM;While operating within an indeterminate system, lawyers nonetheless mustregularly forecast the results of judicial proceedings.andP;  If the broker'sattorney offered to settle the case for $10,000, the buyer's counsel wouldhave to assess that offer.andP;  Few empirical studies have examined the waylawyers actually decide whether to accept settlements or proceed tolitigation.andP;  Yet one can surmise that in our case of the home buyer acompetent and ethical lawyer, presented with the offer described, wouldconsider the following factors:andM;1.andP;  Costs of litigation.andP;  If litigation costs were equal to or greater than$10,000 settlement is clearly indicated given damages of only $20,000.andM;2.andP;  Amount of damages.andP;  If it appears that the plaintiff may have difficultyin proving damages in excess of $10,000 then settlement is clearly indicated.andM;3.andP;  Disbelief of client.andP;  Juries might not believe the buyer.andP;  After takingthe depositions of the parties, attorneys predict how juries will judge thecredibility of their clients.andP;  In making this prediction they will considerthe demeanor of the witnesses.andP;  And given no clear indications that eitherparty is lying, the attorney might conclude that a juror, movedby sympathy,would more readily accept the word of a first time home buyer than accept thecredibility of a broker working for a large national realty company.andM;4.andP;  Application of an unfavorable rule of law.andP;  If, after researching thelaw, the attorney finds that in his jurisdiction the court presently imposesliability on only brokers who knew their representations were false thensettlement is warranted unless the attorney believes thatandM;a) a jury will believe that the broker made statements about the condition ofthe property AND that he knew those statements to be false, orandM;b) the court will change the law to hold brokers liable for false statementshonestly made or will require brokers to make a diligent inspection of thepremises.andM;5.andP;  Skill of the Attorney.andP;  Some lawyers have reputations for obtainingoptimum results for their clients while others may be known to be lessskillful.andP;  Lawyers confident of their litigating prowess or contemptuous ofthe abilities of opposing counsel often reject settlements that more timidcounsel would readily accept.andM;6.andP;  Judge and Jury.andP;  Experienced lawyers realize that certain judges andjuries from certain localities are prone to favor a certain class ofplaintiffs or defendants.andM;The Role of Legal Expert SystemsandM;Thirty years ago Layman Allen laid much of foundation for contemporaryattempts to represent legal knowledge when he proposed encoding statutory lawinto logic as a way of reducing the syntactic ambiguity that is inherent inmost statutes.andP;  A decade ago computer scientists began their efforts torepresent legal knowledge and model legal reasoning.andP;  More recently,researchers have made serious efforts to translate legal rules intologic-based computer programs.andP;  And now efforts are emerging to represent theunique factual and legal issues presented by individual cases.andP;  Though theseefforts may prove useful to lawyers and legal assistants, they will notsignificantly impact the litigation morass that currently engulfs our courtsbecause these systems treat the law as a set of abstract rules rather than asystem manipulated by expert litigators.andP;  Lawyers do not make decisions basedon what the rules &quot;says.&quot; Rather, they base their decisions on how decisionmakers will apply those rules to specific factual situations.andM;In seminal research based on modeling the decision making of legal experts,Peterson and Waterman carefully examined how lawyers and insurance claimsadjusters evaluate product liability claims.andP;  From interviews with theseexperts they framed computer understandable rules that capture the waylawyers actually determine the settlement value of a case.andP;  For our case ofthe home buyer, some rules gathered from experienced litigators might read asshown in Figure 1.andP;  These rules can then be organized into decision trees(illustrated in Figure 2) that replicate the processes used by attorneys inestimating the settlement value of a case.andM;Peterson and Waterman recognize the limits of a strictly rule-based approach:andM;But by themselves, the [rule-based] systems do not provide a generalconceptual structure that can help us understand legal decision making.andP;  Therules are too specific, while the chains of reasoning are ad hoc products ofthe facts in particular cases.andM;Peterson and Waterman [26, p. 632.]andM;The authors then propose a general conceptual structure for evaluating civilliability claims, based on their experience in interviewing litigators andbuilding models of product liability.andP;  In this model, the evaluation of aclaim is broken down into steps, which include:andM;1.andP;  Analysis of loss: What damages can be claimed?andP;  In our case of the homebuyer, this would include direct economic losses such as the cost of repairsand damage to personal property, if any.andP;  In the product liability casesstudied by Peterson and Waterman, general damages due to pain and suffering,limitation of activity, etc., could also be claimed.andM;2.andP;  Analysis of liability: What is the probability of establishing that adefendant is legally liable?andP;  This may depend on the rules of thejurisdiction as well as the facts.andP;  For example, in some jurisdictions it maybe necessary to show that the broker actually knew about the defect, while inothers it may only be necessary to show that the broker could have discoveredit.andM;3.andP;  Analysis of responsibility.andP;  What proportion of the responsibility shouldbe assigned to the plaintiff for his own carelessness&quot;  This also depends onthe rules of the jurisdiction, since some allow damages to be reduced by atheory of comparative negligence.andM;4.andP;  Analysis of characteristics: Characteristics of the litigations, judges,and attorneys are consideredby legal experts when they evaluate a claim.andM;5.andP;  Analysis of context: Strategic considerations such as the timing of thecase, the plaintiff's immediate need for money, and the effect on thedefendant of publicity, etc.andM;The value of a case is estimated according to the following formula: VALUE =LOSS * LIABILITY * RESPONSIBILITY * CHARACTERISTICS * CONTEXTandM;Figure 3 shows the decision tree our case of the home buyer, re-structuredaccording to this more general model.andP;  In this example, we will assume thatthe loss was $30,000, the probability of a plaintiff's verdict has beenevaluated as .8, the plaintiff's responsibility for the loss has beenevaluated as .3,the adjustment for characteristics was 1.1 (more favorable toplaintiffs than to defendant) and the adjustment for context was .9 (e.g.,andO;timing and strategy reduce the case value slightly), then the resulting casevalue would be: VALUE = $30,000 * .8 * .7 * 1.1 * .9 = $16,632andM;We can see how this approach helps to explain the complex effect of a singlefactor: the degree to which the defect was discoverable.andP;  If the defect wasnot discoverable at all, then the question of liability (Step 2) wouldprobably be answered in the negative since the broker was not at fault.andP;  Ifthe defect was very easily discoveable then the buyer's carelessness (Step 3)would probbaly reduce the value of the claim.andP;  However, the answer to Step 3would depend on both the discoverability of the defect and the experience (orinexperience) of the buyer, since a very inexperienced person might notrecognize a defect that an average home buyer would easily discover.andM;The Impact of Predictive Expert SystemsandM;Expert systems that predict the outcome of litigation with a fair degree ofaccuracy, if widely available, would have a profound effect on our legalsystem.andP;  If a court offered litigants the option of choosing acomputer-predicted settlement, many lawsuits would end.andP;  Two factors wouldinduce litigants to accept such settlements.andP;  First, many parties tolitigation are risk averse, unable to absorb total defeat, thereby pressuredto accept a predictable settlement that is below their desired goal.andP;  Moreimportantly, greatly reduced attorney's fees would make such settlements veryattractive to all parties.andP;  Not only would a litigant avoid possible defeat,he or she would also avoid the high costs of litigation.andP;  However, what isdesirable i theory may be difficult to attain in practice.andM;Researchers who have studied the implementation of information systems inorganizations and in society at large have found that institutionalimpediments may retard the develoment and acceptance of computerized systems,no matter how beneficial they may be in the ideal case.andP;  In the real world, acomplex interplay of socio-economic, political and interpersonal incentivesdetermine whether and how computer systems are developed and used.andP;  Morrison,in a study of the attitudes of private law firms toward legal expert systems,found these institutional barriers to be a major cause of the slow growth oflegal expert systems in the private sector.andM;In law, for example, it is clear that the current practice of time billing,as contrasted with value billing, provides a disincentive for attorneys touse legal expert systems which would reduce their number of billable hours.andO;On the other hand, the client's desire for faster and less expensive legalservice provides countervailing pressure to automate, and if legal expertsystems can be shown to lead to better decision making this should provide anadditional incentive for clients.andP;  However, this straighforward analysis maystill be too naive; an expert system that expedites the settlement of caseswould not necessarily be welcomed by all branches of a client corporation.andO;For corporate managers who see their current assignments as short term, asettlement which is chargeable to this year's budget may be less desirablethan a more expensive settlement negotiated at a later time, when the managerhas moved on to a new assignment.andM;Institutional arrangements may also result in expert systems being developedand used for the benefit of one group of clients but not for their opponents.andO;For example, it is not surprising that Peterson and Waterman's research onexpert systems for product liability was funded by the insurance industry.andO;Industries which undertake large amounts of repetitive expert systems strongincentives to develop predictive expert systems for their own use.andP;  It ismuch less likely that expert systems will soon be used by the plaintiffs'attorneys who represent individual clients in suits against insurancecompanies.andM;Another environment where legal expert systems are likely to gain acceptancecan be found in institutions providing free legal services to the poor.andP;  Inlegal aid clinics and the public defense bar, where attorneys on fixedsalaries process a myriad of cases that have similar characteristics, thereare strong incentives and few disincentives for using automation.andP;  In ProjectPericles at Harvard Law School, an expert system was developed forrepresenting indigent tenants, which led to an increase in both the quantityand effectiveness of service available to the tenants, causing problems forlandlords who were required to pay increased hourly fees to their attorneys.andM;Even in the ideal case where predictive expert systems are developed and usedbased solely on their contribution to a more efficient legal system, atroubling paradox emerges if all litigants were to accept computer-predictedsettlements.andP;  Accurate predictions result from encapsulating the thinking ofexperts wjp litigate cases.andP;  Without litigation the experts would have noadditional data to input--leaving the law frozen.andP;  Fortunately, the universalacceptance of such settlements is unlikely.andP;  Since an expert system could nothave rules that account for all possibilities, some litigants would find thecomputer-predicted settlement sufficiently unsatisfactory to justify theexpenses and hazards of litigation.andP;  From such newly litigated cases theexperts would develop new rules to update the system's performance.andP;  Inaddition, changing social values would lead some litigants to rejectsettlements based on relatively static rules.andP;  For example, a home buyermight reject the computer-predicted settlement, recognizing the growingtendency toward consumer protection, and hoping this may lead the court torule that brokers are liable even when they were not aware of the defect.andM;NORMATIVE LEGAL EXPERT SYSTEMSandM;Each year our criminal justice system sentences hundreds of thousands ofcriminals; our family court system determines the economic future of thespouses and children in over one million divorced families, andadministrators of social welfare programs decide what benefits millions ofclients should receive.andP;  Unfortunately, many citizens similarly situatedreceive greatly disparate treatment from discretionary decision makers.andM;For example, a welfare regulation might grant an extra allowance to a personwho is &quot;substantially incapable of performing normal household duties.&quot;andP;  Toone administrator, this might include a person who cannot carry groceriesfrom the store; to another it might only apply to a person who is completelybedridden.andP;  Such discrepancies in interpretation may be uncovered during anofficial appeal, or they may go undetected indefinitely.andM;When a marriage ends in divorce, the legal system is often called upon todetermine the division of property and the award of alimony and childsupport.andP;  These awards vary greatly depending on how a judge categorizes andvalues property; and how he or she measures the incomes and needs of spousesand children.andP;  Some judges may allow the custodial parent to remain in themarital home until the youngest child reaches the age of majority whileothers require the home to be sold within a short time after the divorce.andO;Some judges favor lengthy alimony awards while others routinely deny suchrequests, favoring rehabilitative alimony that lasts only a few years.andO;Needless to say such disparate awards create dissatisfaction among litigants.andO;Indeed, the potential for inequity is so great that over a decade ago it wassuggested that maintenance awards be &quot;calculated on a computer&quot;.andM;Criminal sentencing, in particular, is receiving increasing attention fromthe legal community and the public.andP;  Studies reveal that some judges placethe great majority of criminals on probation while others employ probation ina small number of cases, and anecdotal reports have documented numerous casesof nearly-identical crimes being committed by individuals with very similarbackgrounds, in which one criminal was released while the other received along prison sentence.andP;  Critics believe that inconsistent sentencingundermines effots to both deter and rehabilitate criminals.andM;Public dissatisfaction with inconsistent sentencing has led to a growingdemand for determinate or fixed sentences for certain crimes; however, thissolution also engenders unfairness by failing to consider the uniquecharacteristics of the crime and the criminal.andP;  Arguably, a 15-year-old whosteals a car and takes it for a ride should be treated differently than amember of a professional car theft ring who steals a car for resale.andP;  It isclear that there is a need for agreed-upon standards or norms that wouldprovide a framework for more consistent decision making but would still allowindividual circumstances to be taken into account.andM;One approach to developing such norms would be to maintain a database of alldecisions, which could be queried to find the typical treatment of particulartypes of cases.andP;  Judges and administrators would then be able to find outwhat happened in similar cases before making a decision.andP;  This approach hasbeen pursued by the Law and Computers Project at the University of BritishColumbia.andP;  A Sentencing Data Base has been created which summarizes more than40,000 sentencing decisions of the Provincial and Supreme Courts of BritishColumbia during the past few years.andP;  A very simple interactive interface asksthe user to enter information above five factors:andM;1andM;1.andP;  The crime the defendant committed,andM;2.andP;  the age group of the defendant,andM;3.andP;  the sex of the defendant,andM;4.andP;  whether or not the defendant is married,andM;5.andP;  whether or not the defendant has previously been convicted of anindictable (i.e., serious) offense.andM;The system then displays a histogram showing the frequency of variouscategories of sentences, for all cases in the database that match on the fivefactors.andP;  It is also possible to retrieve a list of the matching casesincluding the exact disposition, the judge, the location, and the plea.andO;Judges in the Provincial Court, Supreme Court, and Court of Appeals ofBritish Columbia have been using the Sentencing Data Base since late 1987,and many find it quite useful.andP;  In addition, both prosecutors and defenseattorneys have used the system and found it useful.andM;The frequency analysis technique applied in the British Columbia sentencingproject is a valuable contribution to legal decision making.andP;  If a judge isconfronted by a crime of breaking and entering that seems to be of ordinaryseverity, he or she will not inadvertently give a sentence that is extremelyharsh or extremely lenient.andP;  If a judge is confronted by a crime that is veryheinous, but where the criminal is a first time offender, he or she can lookup the most severe sentence previously given for this crime to a first timeoffender.andP;  However, there are three major limitations to this technique,where a rule based approach, used in addition to databases, may be useful.andM;1.andP;  A system that analyzes a few factors such as age, sex, and priorconvictions does not approach the true complexity of judicial decisionmaking.andP;  In making decisions, a large number of factors with complexinteractions must be taken into account in order to determine a fairsentence: the nature of the crime including mitigating and aggravatingfactors; the individual characteristics of the defendant including age,education, family status, reputation in the community, etc.; a completereview of the defendant's prior criminal record; and the existence of anyextenuating circumstances.andP;  An attempt to model these hundreds of factors andtheir interactions would preclude the use of simple statistics.andP;  Even if onecould enumerate them, it would be virtually impossible to collect thisinformation for all prior cases.andP;  Existing records often do not contain thisinformation but even if the careful perusal of these records would yield theinformation, society lacks the resources necessary to encode this massiveamount of data.andM;2.andP;  If our current decision makers are behaving inconsistently, as theanecdotal evidence seems to suggest, then the mere reporting of past behaviordoes not ensure a meaningufl pattern for judges to base their futuredecisions on.andP;  The mode of sentences for a particular crime may represent anaccidental congruence of ligh sentences from some judges and severe sentencesfrom others for a collection of crimes and defendants with little in commonother than the formal charge.andM;3.andP;  Databases cannot explain why a particular sentence was given, while thegoal of expert systems is to model the reasoning of human experts, not onlyat the performance level but also at the cognitive level.andP;  One of the mostimportant attributes of expert systems is their ability to explain why aparticular analysis or recommendation was produced (in terms of theirinternal rule-based model).andP;  The creation and use of an expert system putslegal decision making under the microscope of precise computer specification.andO;In areas of discretionary decision making that are believed to suffer fromundesirable inconsistency, AI offers an excisting opportunity to bring morerational approaches into being.andM;It is possible that AI research could result in expert systems that wouldhelp judges produce an acceptable level of evenhandedness without resortingto a rigid model of fixed sentencing.andP;  The expert system would be normativerather than predictive, providing guidance based on a complex modelencompassing characteristics of the crime, mitigating and aggravatingcircumstances, and the characteristics of the individual defendant.andP;  Althoughsuch a system might influence a judge's decisions, he or she would always befree to reject its recommendations, since no matter how many factors wereincluded in the expert system's model, there would always be cases whoseunique circumstances would justify a different result.andM;Modeling Judgemental Decisions:andM;Sentencing as DiagnosisandM;Expert systems have achieved a high level of performance in a number ofspecialized domains, including mineral prospecting, computer configurationand chemical analysis.andP;  But perhaps the largest amount of significantexpertise to be represented in expert systems is in the area of medicaldiagnosis and therapy.andP;  For example, according to Hayes-Roth et al., theCADUCEUS system in 1982 possessed approximately 100,000 associationsrepresenting more knowledge of internal medicine than any human, and was ableto correctly diagnose complex test cases missed by human experts.andM;Medical expert systems are based on a model of heuristic reasoning thatrelates symptoms of illness to suggested therapy, based on intermediateconcepts of disease states (e.g., infectious disease organisms, conditionssuch as alcoholism, heart disease, etc.).andP;  The physician diagnoses thepatient's symptoms by making a judgment about the disease state(s) thatcaused them, determines the general type of therapy required (antibiotics,surgery, special diet, etc.) and finally prescribes a specific treatment.andM;This model can be adapted to the sentencing of criminals by viewing thecriminal acts as symptoms and the sentences as therapy.andP;  The general types oftherapy correspond to various sentencing goals: specific deterrence generaldeterrence, isolation of dangerous individuals, and rehabilitation.andP;  These inturn lead to specific recommendation: probation, a fine, a prison term, or adiversionary program such as community service or treatment for drug abuse.andO;A relevant question that can only be answered through empirical research is:do judges use some notion corresponding to disease states to mediate betweenthe description of a criminal act and the determination of an appropriatesentence?andM;The MYCIN system, one of the first and best known medical expert systems,defined a basic approach to heuristic reasoning that appears to be verypromising for modeling legal judgements:andM;1.andP;  Knowledge is represented by producting rules, applied by adomain-independent inference engine.andP;  (This is now a standard approach inexpert systems.)andM;2.andP;  A conceptual hierarchy of objects, attributes, and values is used tostructure the problem, and is integrated with the inference engine.andP;  Thus,the sophistication of the rule formalism used in MYCIN is far beyond thatnormally found in expert systems shells.andP;  Figure 4 shows a hypotheticalcontext tree that might be applied in evaluating a criminal for sentencing.andO;Using a top-down approach, first the nature of the crime would be considered,including each offense that the defendant is charged with, the defendant'sactions leading to that charge, the victims of the crime, and the surroundingcircumstances.andP;  Then, the characteristics of the defendant would beconsidered, including personal data and information on previous crimes.andO;Finally, the existence of mitigating and aggravating circumstances would beconsidered.andM;3.andP;  Weights are attached to all knowledge elements in the database toindicate how strongly they are believed, and rules are also weighted to showhow important they are.andP;  The system provides an algorithm for combiningweights to measure the overall strength of each conclusion.andP;  The ability torepresent varying degrees to which attributes apply (e.g., degrees ofviolence of an assault) is critical in the legal domain.andM;Figure 5, although greatly oversimplified, shows the kinds of rules thatmight be included in such an expert system.andP;  The sample rules are intended tohelp in weighing the evidence for and against the hypothesis, &quot;D is dangerousto society.&quot;andP;  For example, rule R1 in Figure 5 says the &quot;danger factor&quot;associated with illegal use of firearms is .5 and rule R2 says the dangerfactor associated with possession or sale of drugs is .5.andP;  Using the MYCINrule for combining evidence, the &quot;danger factor&quot; associated with both ofthese offenses would be .75.andM;4.andP;  Rules are allowed to explicitly refer to the strength of belief in thefactors appearing in their premises; thus, a jail term may be indicated whenthe danger factor exceeds a particular value, e.g.: IF there is stronglysuggestive evidence (.7) that D is dangerous to society THEN the recommendedsentence for D should include incarceration 1.0.andM;Experiments with medical expert systems have shown several aspects of theMYCIN model that need to be improved.andP;  One aspect is the reliance on top-downcontrol, which frequently leads to a line of questioning that has nothing todo with the current case.andP;  Another aspect is the fact that symptoms tend tooccur in meaningful clusters, so that their weights are not reallyindependent.andP;  The CADUCEUS system includes an initial consultation in whichthe user can enter the symptoms of the current case in whatever order he orshe wants.andP;  CADUCEUS also employs a more complex model of medical knowledge,which takes account of the way certain combinations of symptoms providestrong evidence for particular conclusions.andM;Is the MYCIN model an appropriate tool for modeling the way judges evaluatecriminals for sentencing?andP;  Will the described limitations of MYCIN also berelevant in the legal domain?andP;  Or will other information structures that havenot yet been considered be suggested by a study of judicial decision making?andO;As AI researchers attempt to answer these questions, they will contribute toa better understanding of how our legal system works.andP;  Whether or not expertsystems are actually used in the courtroom, the exercise has potential valueas a tool for jurisprudential analysis.andM;The Impact of Normative Expert SystemsandM;Even if computers did not exist it would make sense for legal decision makersto carefully analyze how and why they make their decisions.andP;  To that end,some courts have formal mechanisms by which judges gather to shareinformation.andP;  In addition, many informal mechanisms permit decision makers toexchange views about the laws they administer.andP;  However, the growingcomplexity of the legal system and the time pressure on decision makers makesit difficult to maintain norms through merely gathering to share information.andM;One solution which is gaining popularity is the development of statutoryguidelines.andP;  When legislators mandate the creation of guidelines forsentencing criminals or dividing up marital property they strive toincorporate societal wisdom on how to best resolve a certain class of case.andO;But written guidelines are of limited utility when compared to expertsystems' ability to model certain kinds of decision-making problems.andP;  Mostimportantly, the computer can handle a far greater number of interacting ruesthan a person looking at a printed page; thus, the practical limitations oflegislative drafting precude the listing of the myriad of factors thatideally should be taken into account.andP;  In addition, the legislative processmakes fine tuning a system most diffcult while expert systems can be easilyadjusted to correct errors and omissions.andM;Normative expert systems would never replace human judgement.andP;  Rather, theywould provide decision makers with the tools to better understand, evaluate,and disseminate their ideas.andP;  No computer would ever sentence a defendant,make a child support award, or grant a housing allowance.andP;  But a computercould advise a decision maker on what factors and issues should beconsidered, and how his or her colleagues would be likely to view a case withsimilar facts.andM;In spite of the potential of normative expert systems to assist discretionarydecision makers, there are significant barriers to their development and use.andO;First, decision makers who are accustomed to viewing themselves asindependent, judgemental thinkers may view expert systems as mechanizing or&quot;de-skilling&quot; their jobs.andP;  To the extent that this perception exists, thesystems are likely to be strongly resisted.andP;  The best way to overcome thisbarrier is to make the decision makers the &quot;owners&quot; of the knowledge base, sothat they will see it as a tool that they have created for themselves.andO;However, most legal decision makers are not accustomed to using computers, sothere is a &quot;comfort&quot; barrier that must be overcome, as well as the naturalskepticism of professionals that computers could be an effective tool intheir domain.andM;Second, if the use of an expert system would change the distribution ofdecisions, this might be unacceptable to the administering organization or tosociety.andP;  For example, many social entitlement programs such as workerscompensation, medicaid, and social security disability, have statutory rulesthat determine eligibility.andP;  According to some experts, the workerscompensation rules are often misapplied to the detriment of theworkers--resulting in a much lower cost to the government.andP;  If this view iscorrect, a legal expert system that accurately embodied these rules couldresult in a significant increase in benefits paid out, a cost which societymight not be willing to pay.andP;  On the other hand, if social securitydisability benefits, which are determined by the states but paid byWashington, are being administered too liberally, state officials mightresist the use of an expert system which would lower the overall benefitspaid to their constituents.andM;The relationship between computer information systems and the development ofnorms has been studied by Kling, whose research shows that when norms are nottaken into account, development projects are likely to fail.andP;  Kling presentsseveral examples, including a project to upgrade the U.S.andP;  World WideMilitary Command and Control System (WWMCCS), which was criticized in a 1981report by the General Accounting Office (GAO) as follows: &quot;DOD, despitedozens of large-scale studies, has failed to make meaningful progress ...&quot;.andO;Kling trace the failure of the WWMCCS modernization to the need for fieldcommanders in the three services to agree on precisely what data they need.andO;He notes that different tactical battle doctrines held by officers in thethree services result in different requirements for an information system,and suggests that until this problem is addressed the project cannot succeed.andM;Kling's research, which is focused on the organizational response to computersystems, reveals how the absence of shared norms can be an obstacle toachieving the primary goal of developing a useful computer system.andP;  On theother hand, in certain areas of law such as sentencing and child support, thedevelopment of norms is a primary goal; the use of an expert system isjustified by its contribution to that objective.andP;  In either case, however,the need to agree on the behavior of the computer brings normative issuesdramatically into focus.andP;  It is this focusing effect which is the primarybenefit claimed here for legal expert systems.andM;There are potential dangers as well as benefits in the use of normativeexpert systems.andP;  Critics of artificial intelligence such as Weizenbaum havewarned about over-reliance on computers; for example, a decision maker mightbe reluctant to vary from the computer's advice even when the facts sowarranted.andP;  This is not a new problem for the legal system; the same dangerexists with presumptive sentencing when the legislature suggests, but doesnot require, judges to sentence within certain parameters.andP;  In the same waythat a judge might blindly follow a legislative guideline, a judge mightignore a directive to treat the output of a computer as merely advisory.andO;Furthermore, it is possible that expert systems will carry greater implicitauthority than legislative guidelines, due to their ability to respond tomore factual variations and also due to the dynamic quality of computerprograms.andP;  Although expert systems, if properly constructed, have the abilityto explain the reasoning on which their recommendations are based, it is alltoo easy to just accept the recommendations without examining the reasoningbehind them.andM;Is this a realistic scenario?andP;  Perhaps in the early 1970's when Weizenbaumwas building the ELIZA program, it was more realistic than it will be in the1990's.andP;  In a seminar on Artificial Intelligence and Law taught by theauthors at Northeastern University, we have observed a growing understandingon the part of law students who take the course on the capabilities andlimitations of computers.andP;  It is not unreasonable to suppose that, ascomputers become commonplace in schools and colleges, as youngsters grow upplaying &quot;adventure&quot; games, and as computer programs for various tasks (forexample, tax preparation and estate planning) become commonplace, expertsystems will become a part of everyday life whose uses and dangers aregenerally recognized, just as electricity and automobiles are today.andP;  Thedangers of any technology must be weighed against its benefits.andP;  The questionfor expert systems is whether they can contribute to making the legal systemmore fair and less costly than it is today.andM;Of all the issues surrounding the use of normative expert systems, perhapsthe most significant is the possibility for review of discretionary decisionsin areas where such review is now difficult to obtain.andP;  Most jurisdictions doprovide for the review of criminal sentences and alimony awards.andP;  But as apractical matter such reviews rarely succeed because appellate judgesroutinely hold that such decisions are within the discretion of the trier offact.andP;  Such non-reviewability is virtually dictated by the unavailability ofnormas.andP;  Rarely can an appellate judge find a sentence or alimony awardunreasonable because standards of reasonableness do not exist.andP;  The processof knowledge engineering that would be required in order to build normativeexpert systems would have the desirable side effect of helping to developsuch standards.andM;CONCLUSIONSandM;Weizenbaum argues that computers ought not to make judicial decisions, eventhough they could conceivably do so.andP;  We strongly agree, and in anotherreport discuss a number of reasons why legal decisions cannot be explained byany rule-based model of law, however complex.andP;  The legal decision maker notonly applies existing rules, but is often called upon to creatively modifyrules, to choose among competing rules, and to create new rules.andM;But we must recognize the practical benefits as well as the theoreticallimitations of technology:andM;a.andP;  In legal disputes where money is at stake, the cost of the disputeresolution process must be allowed to enter the moral equation.andP;  If aperfectly just award must be shared 50-50 with a lawyer, an approximateresult computed by an expert system of which the petitioner keeps 90 percentmay be preferable.andM;b.andP;  Where discretion has been shown to foster gross inconsistency and shelterdiscriminatory practices, it may be an improvement to have an expert systemgenerating a range of standard alternatives, with a requirement for writtenjustification when decisions fall outside the range.andP;  The important questionsto ask are: Would more people understand WHY they got the result they did?andM;c.andP;  When citizens governed by a system of legal rules cannot ascertain thecontent of those rules, we must question whether we have a system of law,.andO;as that term is commonly understood.andP;  Given the expanded complexity andamount of legal materials, the cost of &quot;finding the law&quot; has, for manycitizens, rendered the law unfathomable.andP;  By making the law more accessible,conceptual retrieval systems have the potential of enhancing the legitimacyof our legal system.andM;The specter of a computer sentencing a criminal or forcing parties in adispute to accept a predetermined settlement is often raised as a potentialnegative result of developing expert systems for law.andP;  But such things arehappening even without expert systems--the emergence of no-fault insurance,proposed caps on malpractice awards, the trend toward determinate sentencing,and formal child support guidelines are all indications that, in reaction tothe excessive cost and complexity of the legal system, citizens are willingto resort to an algorithmic determination of their rights.andP;  Algorithms thatare written in the statute books and applied mechanically by humanadministrators are the paper equivalents of allowing a computer to make thedecisions.andP;  Expert systems can be used in the service of such algorithmicdecision making, but they can also be used to organize and present therelevant facts and issues in the service of human decision makers.andP;  Thepredictive and normative expert systems described in this article areintended to serve the latter function.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
