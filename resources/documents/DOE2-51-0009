Excess diazoalkane addition to [Mn{sub 2}(CO){sub 4}({mu}-CO)({mu}-dppm){sub2}]; dppm = Ph{sub 2}PCH{sub 2}PPH{sub 2}, produces 1:1 adducts of formula[Mn{sub 2}(CO){sub 4}{{mu}-C(O)CHRN{sub 2}}({Lambda}-dppm){sub 2}](R= H,Me,CO{sub 2}Et) containing a novel metallacycle derived from couplingof the diazoalkane molecule with a carbonyl ligand. The structure wasestablished by an x-ray analysis of [Mn{sub 2}(CO){sub 4}{{mu}-C(O)CH{sub2}N{sub 2}}({mu}-dppm){sub 2}]. Photolysis or thermolysis of each adductregenerates [Mn{sub 2}(CO){sub 4}({mu}-CO)({mu}-dppm){sub 2}]. A seriesof ({mu}-alkylidene)dicobalt complexes was prepared via CO displacementfrom [Co{sub 2}(CO){sub 4}({mu}-CO){sub 2}({mu}-dppm)] at 25{sup 0}Cby excess diazoalkane addition. Low temperature NMR studies revealeda facile, concerted interconversion from bridging to terminal sites forthe bridging units in [Co{sub 2}(CO){sub 4}({mu}-CO)({mu}-CH{sub 2})({mu}-dppm)]and [Co{sub 2}(CO){sub 4}({mu}-CH{sub 2}){sub 2}({mu}-dppm)] only. Carbon-carboncoupling reactions occur at 25{sup 0}C in reactions of (Co{sub 2}(CO){sub4}({mu}-CH{sub 2}){sub 2}({mu}-dppm)] with RCCR to give C{sub 2}H{sub4} and [Co{sub 2}(CO){sub 4}({mu}-RCCR)({mu}-dppm)](R = CF{sub 3},Ph),with C{sub 2}H{sub 4} to give C{sub 3}H{sub 6}, and, at 80{sup 0}C, withH{sub 2} to yield C{sub 2}H{sub 6}.</TEXT></DOC>
