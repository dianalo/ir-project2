In lieu of that policy, the FDIC and the comptroller of the currency proposed a joint rule allowing regulators to compel public disclosure on a case-by-case basis. The rule would also require banks to disclose financial data to the public annually.    The FDIC's disclosure policy, adopted in 1985, was strongly opposed by the banking industry and the date it was to take effect was postponed three times. Bankers argued that disclosure of all enforcement actions &quot;wouldn't be in the best interest for the general public&quot; because the reports could be misinterpreted, according to Kirk Willison, spokesman for the American Bankers Association. The new proposal is &quot;a great improvement&quot; over the earlier policy, Mr. Willison said.    Currently, the FDIC, which regulates state-chartered banks that aren't members of the Federal Reserve System, generally requires that enforcement actions against a bank be disclosed only to its shareholders. In addition, termination of FDIC insurance must be disclosed to a bank's depositors. The comptroller, who regulates national banks, generally requires disclosure only of securities law violations.    The proposed rule, issued yesterday by both the FDIC and the comptroller for 60 days of public comment, would also require that banks each year provide the public with basic financial data, including a balance sheet and an income statement. </TEXT></DOC>
