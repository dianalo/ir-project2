Chairman Kim Cham attributed the drop to expenses involved in setting up the exchange's highly successful Hang Seng stock-index futures contract and in moving the exchange to new quarters.    Based on the Hong Kong stock market's leading barometer, the Hang Seng future is the world's third-most popular stock-index contract, behind contracts in Chicago and New York.    Meanwhile, the exchange's board said it would recommend at next month's annual general meeting that four exchange directors receive large lump-sum remunerations for services rendered over the last few years.    The board said it would recommend that Mr. Cham receive four million dollars for his services from 1983 to 1987. Vice chairman Ronald Li would be given 400,000 dollars for services during the same period, and two other vice chairmen, Ho Tak Ching and Ying Tse Yen, each would receive 200,000 dollars for work performed between 1985 and 1987.    Mr. Cham said the remuneration would be based on this year's &quot;much improved&quot; profitability and would come out of the 1987 account. </TEXT></DOC>
