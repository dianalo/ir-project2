Daniel, assistant chiefhydrologist for scientific information management at USGS.andM;In the controversial settlement, both the agency and Data General were to paymoney to another bidder, SMS Data Products Group Inc. of Reston, Va., inreturn for SMS' agreement to drop out of the competition.andP;  The settlement didnot take place because the appeals court refused to approve it.andM;Earlier this month Rep.andP;  Peter H. Kostmayer (D-Pa.), chairman of thesubcommittee, asked Interior Secretary Manual Lujan Jr.andP;  to &quot;considerseriously the immediate cancellation&quot; of the DIS-II recompetition untilquestions can be answered about the settlement plan.andM;&quot;I am concerned at the appearance that this settlement gives, i.e., thatInterior and Data General offered to pay SMS to go away, so that Interiorcould reinstate the contract award to Data General -- an award that hasalready been judicially determined to be unlawful,&quot; Kostmayer wrote toInterior Secretary Manuel Lujan in an Oct. 4 letter.andM;Under the terms of the settlement plan, Interior would have paid SMS $275,000for attorney's fees that the company incurred in a previous protest, and DataGeneral was to pay SMS an undisclosed amount as &quot;further reimbursement of bidand proposal costs.&quot;andM;Sources familiar with the procurement said the settlement offered by DataGeneral to SMS would have been about $1 million.andP;  Data General officialswould not comment.andM;But on Aug. 30, the court rejected the settlement terms as unacceptable,because they excluded a third bidder, Lockheed Missiles andamp; Space Company Inc.andM;&quot;I believe that this situation requires extensive executive agency managementattention to ensure that the DIS-II procurement is conducted on a full, fairand open competitive basis,&quot; Kostmayer wrote.andM;&quot;Therefore, I request immediate action on your part to block further actionon the procurement until you can assure yourself and this committee thatthese matters have been fully reviewed, all issues resolved and correctivemeasures taken,&quot; he wrote.andM;IG InvolvedandM;Besides Lujan, Interior Inspector General James Richard received a copy ofKostmayer's letter.andP;  Sources said the IC is investigating the procurement.andM;In interviews, both the former DIS-II contracting officer, Ronnie Rogin, whohas moved to a new job at the Treasury Department, and Daniel insisted theagency had done nothing improper.andM;The procurement began in February 1989, when USGS issued a request forproposals for hardware, software and services to replace the Water ResourcesDivision's Distributed Information System (DIS).andM;The new nationwide system, like its predecessor, would be used to processhydrological data and publish reports.andM;DIS-II also would move to a Unix operating environment.andM;After Interior awarded the contract to Data General in December 1989, bothLockheed and SMS protested to the GSBCA.andM;In its decision, the board said SMS had received the highest technical scoreand submitted a lower-priced best-and-final offer.andP;  In addition, the boardfound that the agency's grounds for excluding SMS -- alleged fundamentalnon-compliance with certain software licensing and interoperabilityrequirements -- could not be interpreted as a requirement of thesolicitation.andM;The system Data General proposed would include about 5,700 Data GeneralAviion workstations and 300 Aviion-5100 servers and larger systems from PrimeComputer Inc.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
