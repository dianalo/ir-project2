The Final Focus System (FFS) must enable, beyond itsbasic optical design, the detection and correction of errors accumulatedin the system. In this paper, after summarizing the design, we reviewthe sensitivity to such errors and the ability to correct them. The overalltuning strategy involves three phases: single beam spot minimization,steering the beams in collision and luminosity optimization with beam-beameffects.</TEXT></DOC>
