The proposal, which would pay $28 in cash for each of the 39.27million TW shares Coniston does not already own, had been expected.The aggressive New York investment firm acknowledged two weeks agothat it had amassed a 19 percent stake in TW and might seek toacquire the company, whose operations include the Denny'srestaurant chain.   TW spokesman James Ryan said the board had received a letterfrom Coniston and was reviewing the offer. But shortly afterConiston's stake was disclosed last month, the TW board indicatedintended to remain independent.   On the New York Stock Exchange, TW stock jumped $1.75 a share to$26.62{ in afternoon trading.   In the letter, Coniston said that while it considered theoffering price to be ``full and fair,'' it was ``willing toconsider offering more if (TW) can demonstrate sufficient businessprospects to justify doing so.''   Wall Street analysts agreed the price was reasonable, but somehave estimated that TW's break-up value might be as high as $34 ashare.   The Coniston principals have said that they consider TW to be aprime candidate for a leveraged buyout. In such a buyout, thepurchaser relies on borrowed money, secured by a target company'sassets, to finance an acquisition. The loans are repaid out of cashflow and, occasionally, the sale of assets.   In this case, however, Coniston hinted it would not completelydismember TW, which also operates food services companies and asmall chain of nursing homes.   ``We would like to work with operating management to build andenhance the company's core food service and restaurant business,''Coniston said in its letter.   The partnership, which made the bid through SWT AssociatesLimited Partnership, is going to be ``a major force to reckonwith,'' said Lloyd Rixe, an analyst with the investment firm D.A.Davidson andamp; Co. in Great Falls, Mont.   ``It's anybody's guess if someone else will surface,'' he said.   Coniston paid an average $19 a share for the 9.28 million TWshares it purchased over a period of days in September. Roughly 7.2million of those shares had belonged to billionaire takeoverstrategist Ronald O. Perelman, chairman of Revlon Inc.   After meeting with Coniston principals late last month, TW'schief executive officer, Frank Salizzoni, said, ``In view of thebright operating prospects for the company, we believe that theshareholders will be served best by the company's remainingindependent.''   Coniston principal Paul Tierney Jr. said in a telephoneinterview that he hoped that the much more specific terms _ such asprice and financing _ spelled out in Thursday's letter would givethe TW board reason to reconsider.   If the board again rejected the overture, Tierney said, thepartnership might proceed with a hostile tender offer directly toshareholders. Coniston requested a response by Wednesday.   Formed in late 1986 as a result of the liquidation of TransWorld Corp., TW Services reported profits of $47.2 million onrevenue of $2.5 billion last year. The company's $850 millionacquisition of the Denny's chain in late 1987 is expected to boostrevenues to the $3.5 billion mark this year.   TW attributed its strong second-quarter performance to Denny'sbetter than expected showing. Since the acquisition, TW has trimmedstaff and embarked on a program to remodel the 1,220-restaurantchain. Over the next five years, the company plans to expand thechain by 500 restaurants.   ``They've been making claims that Denny's has surpassed Wendy'sas the No. 3'' restaurant chain in the nation, said Jay Freedman,an analyst at Kidder Peabody andamp; Co.   TW also owns the Chicago-based Canteen Corp., which contractsfood, vending and recreational services throughout the nation atplaces like stadiums and national parks. Ryan said Canteen has morethan 1,700 accounts and about $1.5 billion in annual sales.   The company also owns Spartan Food Systems Inc. of Spartanburg,S.C. The unit operates more than 400 Hardee's restaurants and 200Quincy Family Steak houses, mostly in the southeastern part of thecountry.   Coniston Partners, with a warchest estimated at about $700million, typically takes large positions in companies and uses thatclout to force management to sell the company or make changes thatboost the stock price.   Coniston recently emerged from a bitter proxy battle withGillette Co. that saw the partners narrowly lose their bid for fourseats on the razor-blade maker's board of directors. Ultimately thetwo sides reached a settlement that included a stock buyback and astandstill agreement.</TEXT></DOC>
