The executions in Shanghai were carried out despite appeals forclemency by President Bush and other Western leaders.   Premier Li Peng denounced the foreign criticism.   He told visiting Foreign Secretary Humayun Khan of Pakistan thatmost of the millions of Chinese who took part nationwide in marches,sit-ins and hunger strikes for a freer society would be treatedleniently ``even if they had extremist opinions.''   But Li said, ``The tiny minority of criminals will be punishedaccording to the law.''   The meeting was the first top-level contact with a foreigndelegation since the crackdown began June 3-4, when the army firedon students and supporters in Beijing to end their pro-democracydemonstrations.   More than 1,600 arrests have been reported nationwide since, andthe nation's highest court has urged lower courts to deal swiftlyand severely with protest-related cases.   So far, 28 people have been condemned to death: the three whowere executed, the 17 who were sentenced on Wednesday, and eightothers who were previously sentenced to death.   The Shanghai men were convicted of setting a train on fire onJune 6 after it plowed into a barricade set up by protesters,killing six people.   They were shot to death Wednesday after Shanghai's highest courtrejected their appeals, a spokesman at the city's Foreign AffairsOffice said. He said he did not know other details and refused togive his name.   The national television news reported the executions, which anofficial at the city's Foreign Affairs office on Thursday said werecarried out at an execution ground. Due to an error in translation,an official at the office was understood Wednesday to have said thethree were executed before a crowd.   The men were Xu Guoming, a brewery worker; Yan Xuerong, a radiofactory worker; and Bian Hanwu, who was unemployed.   Beijing radio said 45 people who ``seriously endangered publicorder'' were tried in front of an audience of 10,000 people in Jinanin eastern China's Shandong province.   It did not give details of their alleged crimes, but said somewere given the death penalty. Others were given death sentencessuspended for two years with the possibility of being commuted tolife in prison, the radio reported.   An editor at the state-run Jinan Daily said 17 of the 45 weregiven death sentences, but said he did not know if the figureincluded those given two-year reprieves.   The public trial in Jinan and executions in Shanghai underscoredChina's emphasis on using the death penalty as a deterrent.   China does not release figures on executions and not all arereported in the official media. By Western count, more than 10,000people were executed in a period of several years after ananti-crime drive began in 1983.   Death sentences usually are carried out by a bullet to the backof the head. They are sometimes commuted to life in prison but thereis no record of a sentence being overturned on appeal in CommunistChina.   Li defended China's actions as necessary to put down a``counterrevolutionary rebellion.''   ``When China is in difficulties for the time being it seesclearly who are true friends and who are false ones,'' thetelevision news quoted him as saying.   The government did not immediately respond to Bush's suspensionof high-level U.S.-Chinese contacts and moves to block $1.4 billionin development loans to protest the crackdown. France and theNetherlans already had frozen relations and Japan has suspended newdevelopment loans.   In Washington, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said theBush administration deeply regrets the executions but was notconsidering additional sanctions.   ``There is an important relationship which we should seek topreserve if we possibly can,'' he said.   China's State Education Commission ordered local governments toarrange ``political ideological education'' for college students,especially those graduating this year.   Its order, published in the party newspaper, the People's Daily,said the main ``weapon'' in such classes should be a June 9 speechby senior leader Deng Xiaoping that said the students has been usedby anti-party plotters.   Deng said the greatest mistake of his 10 years in power was afailure to educate students and the public.   Local radio in the southeastern city of Canton said some studentsthere still were organizing illegal activities and were ordered tostop and confess to police. No details of their activities weregiven.   Officials at the Beijing airport said they arrested four peopledescribed as fugitives linked to the protests. Officials in Hebeiprovince just south of Beijing said they had arrested 44 fugitives,including two Beijing two student activists.   Shanghai officials said 65 people surrendered there, including 42student and citizen activists. They said some, after ``seeing thelight,'' informed on others.   Canadian Charge D'Affairs Daniel Dhavernas protested to theForeign Ministry over an apparent attempt by plainclothes police toseize Canadian reporter Jan Wong.   Ms. Wong, of the Toronto Globe and Mail, said three men who didnot identify themselves on Monday tried to push her into an unmarkedcar but gave up when she resisted and a crowd gathered. She calledthe attack police harassment.   China has banned most foreign reporting activities in Beijing andexpelled six foreign reporters in the past two weeks for allegedlyviolating the rules.</TEXT></DOC>
