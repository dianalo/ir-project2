<DOC><DOCNO> WSJ880629-0023 </DOCNO><HL> Business Brief: Allied-Signal Inc. </HL><SO> </SO><CO> ALD </CO><TEXT>   Allied-Signal Inc. said it expects second-quarter profit from continuing operations to increase 25% to 80 cents a share from 64 cents in the year-earlier period.    In the 1987 quarter, the Morristown, N.J.-based advanced technology concern had a gain of $37 million, or 21 cents a share, making net income $148 million, or 85 cents a share. No extraordinary gains or losses are anticipated for the 1988 period, the company said.    At a meeting with securities analysts yesterday, Edward L. Hennessy Jr., chairman and chief executive officer, attributed the improved profit picture to Allied-Signal's engineered materials and automotive businesses. Higher earnings by Union Texas Petroleum, an oil and gas concern 39% owned by Allied-Signal, also will contribute to the increase, Mr. Hennessy said.    Also aiding the per-share outlook is the 1987 stock buy-back program that decreased the number of shares outstanding by 25 million, to 150 million.    Mr. Hennessy declined to provide a net-income or sales forecast for the year or quarter. </TEXT></DOC>
