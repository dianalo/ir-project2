A spokeswomansaid Bush has no intention of ``parading people around.''   Bush campaign sources said the vice president likely will useprivate polling to gauge the vote-drawing appeal of various ticketcombinations as he moves toward a decision.   Meanwhile, Bush decided to keep a low profile during most of theDemocratic convention next week. He extended a planned three-dayfishing trip with Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III to fivedays.   He will spend Saturday through Wednesday at a remote locationnear Cody, Wyo., aides said. Campaign sources said Bush would usethe time to discuss broad campaign strategy, as well as potentialrunning mates, with Baker.   Baker, a long-time friend who managed Bush's failed 1980presidential campaign and oversaw President Reagan's 1984re-election campaign, is expected to resign his Treasury post laterthis summer to become Bush's campaign chairman.   Bush plans to actively campaign from late Wednesday through thefollowing weekend, aides said.   Meanwhile, Bush goes to New York on Thursday to argue the U.S.case before the United Nations Security Council, which isconsidering a resolution condemning the United States for theshooting down of an Iranian jetliner.   ``Efforts to second guess the the captain of that ship will berebuffed,'' Bush said in a speech to the American Farm BureauFederation. ``I can't wait to get up there to defend the policy ofthe United States government.''   The completion of the Democratic ticket on Tuesday with MichaelDukakis' selection of Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, as his runningmate started up Bush's own search for a running mate, campaignaides said.   ``He'll decide on his process and then very privately carry itout. He's not parading people around at all. What you'll hear is alot of conjecture, but none of it will be from him,'' said Bush'spress secretary Shelia Tate.   Ms. Tate said Bush expected to work on the selection process inmeetings in Washington before he leaves for his fishing trip.   Bush still intends to disclose his choice at the RepublicanNational Convention in New Orleans in mid-August, she said. ``Hesmiles and laughs and says he wants to see if he can hold it untilthen,'' she said.   The six key Bush advisers who are overseeing his campaign _campaign chairman Lee Atwater, chief of staff Craig Fuller,strategist Robert Teeter, media consultant Roger Ailes, New Yorkinvestment banker Nicholas Brady and Texas oilman Robert Mosbacher_ met on Tuesday to discuss the Bentsen nomination, said campaignsources.   Campaign sources said Teeter would recommend targeted polling todetermine which potential GOP vice presidential choice might havethe best vote-drawing ability.   Bush in the past has said geographical concerns are important inbalancing the ticket, but not the prime concern.   Furthermore, the vice president has said he wants to make surehe uses ``a different method'' than President Reagan did in naminghim to the No. 2 spot on the ticket in 1980. He was an 11th hourcompromise at the 1980 convention after a chaotic few days duringwhich Reagan toyed with the idea of sharing the ticket with formerPresident Gerald Ford.   Political analysts continued to speculate on what the Bentsenchoice might mean for the makeup of the GOP ticket.   ``There are two tracks going on,'' said Norman Ornstein, ananalyst with the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ``Hecan now counter Bentsen with (Kansas Sen.) Bob Dole, pick theWashington insider, the veteran who knows how to make things workin the Senate. That would be the safe choice.''   ``The other theory is that he will go for a young face _ someonelike (South Carolina Gov.) Carroll Campbell, (former TennesseeGov.) Lamar Alexander or (New Jersey Gov.) Thomas Kean.''   Ornstein said he did not think Bush would pick a woman runningmate because ``that would be a gamble and George Bush is not agambler.''   Eddie Mahe, a GOP consultant and a campaign adviser to Bush,said he thinks Bush ``should reinforce the conservative side. It isthe activist-oriented conservative side where some reinforcement isneeded.''   Mahe suggested Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor or Sen.William Armstrong of Colorado but added, ``He'll probably end up''with New York Rep.   Jack Kemp because Kemp might help in his native California.</TEXT></DOC>
