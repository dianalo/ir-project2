Angel Castillo Jr., assistant managing editor for news for Knight-Ridder Inc.'s Herald, resigned Wednesday, a day after the paper withheld publication of a regular column by a Miami radio commentator who also writes for the editorial pages of El Herald, the newspaper's Spanish-language daily. Mr. Castillo was in charge of El Herald.    &quot;Not permitting a person to give his version of things is not the type of journalism with which I feel comfortable,&quot; he said. He said the Herald's action amounted to censorship. The Herald denied that, and printed the disputed column yesterday, along with a note saying the editors disagreed with certain assertions it made.    Pete Weitzel, the Herald's managing editor, said the disputed column, written by Tomas Regalado, the news director of Spanish-language station WQBA-AM, had denied statements that Mr. Regalado had made to the paper. Last week, the Herald printed stories quoting Mr. Regalado as saying officials of Radio Marti, a U.S. government station that beams news and entertainment programs to Cuba, had sometimes delivered tapes to WQBA for rebroadcast in Miami. U.S. regulations prohibit the domestic rebroadcast of programs made by government stations such as Radio Marti, except by special arrangements.    In his subsequent column, Mr. Regalado denied the statements attributed to him. &quot;At no point have we received any type of tapes from any type of Radio Marti official or any person linked to Radio Marti,&quot; Mr. Regalado wrote.    Mr. Weitzel said he told Mr. Regalado the column couldn't be printed with what the paper contended was an inaccurate assertion. Mr. Weitzel said he suggested that the paper either take out the offending paragraph or hold the column until the factual dispute could be resolved.    &quot;I am absolutely convinced that the reporting was accurate,&quot; he added.    Richard Capen, the newspaper's publisher, said Mr. Castillo was &quot;flat wrong&quot; in his charge of censorship. &quot;We have not exercised any censorship,&quot; he said, noting that the entire column was published yesterday. &quot;All we did was delay it to resolve an issue of fact.&quot;    Mr. Castillo had been out of town, and Mr. Weitzel said Mr. Castillo couldn't be reached when the decision was made to hold the column.    Mr. Capen said he didn't think Mr. Castillo's resignation would harm the paper's drive to attract more Latin readers. &quot;It won't have any impact at all,&quot; said Mr. Capen. &quot;In recent months we have promoted a number of outstanding Cuban-American executives to senior management positions.&quot;    But some reporters disagreed. &quot;People will question what we cover and how we cover,&quot; one reporter said. &quot;It could hit reporters in the face.&quot;    Mr. Castillo, 40 years old, was hired last October as part of a program to increase readership of the Herald by Miami's growing Latin population. Mr. Castillo, a lawyer and a former reporter for the New York Times and the St. Petersburg Times, now plans to practice law. </TEXT></DOC>
