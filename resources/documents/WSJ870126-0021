But there's more to judging these stocks than watching the market's percolations, analysts warn, despite the extra push management company shares get from a broad move up -- or down.    &quot;I wouldn't be buying them just as a way to participate in the market directly,&quot; says Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services Inc. in New York.    Thomas C. Ackerman, research director at Fechtor, Detwiler andamp; Co. in Boston, says an investor needn't be bullish about the market so much as &quot;bullish on the concept that people are going to put their assets in mutual funds,&quot; a prospect that can be enhanced by the kind of stock market volatility that happened Friday.    Whether for predominantly fixed-income fund firms, such as Franklin Resources Inc. and American Capital Management andamp; Research, or recognized equity managers, such as Pioneer Group or T. Rowe Price Associates, management-firm share prices have been rising in recent weeks. In Friday's whipsaw session at the New York Stock Exchange, Franklin closed at $43 a share, up 37.5 cents, in composite trading. American Capital fell 12.5 cents to $23.25 in composite trading on the Big Board. Pioneer Group fell $1 to $29 in national over-the-counter trading, while T. Rowe Price gained 25 cents, closing at $37.25. After the market closed, T. Rowe Price president George J. Collins said the firm expects to report earnings of about $2 a share for 1986, up from $1.14 the year before.    Dreyfus Corp., weighted toward fixed-income funds, rose 50 cents to $38 a share in Big Board composite trading -- close to the firm's 52-week high of $39.50.    Recent gains by Dreyfus have rekindled speculation that the highly visible mutual fund complex might be in the eyes of some suitor.    Howard Stein, chairman, shrugged off the speculation, saying that every time in the past 12 years when the stock's activity and price are high, rumors surface.    &quot;Nobody's called and I'm not waiting for any calls,&quot; Mr. Stein said through a spokesman.    Dreyfus at $38 a share still represents a good buy to John E. Keefe, analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert in New York. Mr. Keefe thinks Dreyfus could climb into the 40s, based on his earnings expectations. He is recommending Dreyfus, Franklin Resources and Colonial Group Inc.    But some analysts think Dreyfus, probably the most liquid and well-known of the group, may be getting a little pricey.    &quot;I'm not going to put a 'one' rating on Dreyfus and pound the table&quot; at its recent price, says Larry Eckenfelder, analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in San Francisco. Still, if investors &quot;jump on the (market) bandwagon&quot; the stock price could escalate, he says.    Measuring the downside risk of management firms when the market turns is a tough call, Mr. Eckenfelder says. Other questions concern firms' prospects for asset growth, market performance and marketing skills, he says.    Fechtor Detwiler's Mr. Ackerman says more clues will arrive in management firms' fourth-quarter and year-end earnings reports, just starting. He thinks reasonably priced buys currently include Franklin Resource, Colonial, and Eaton Vance Corp. On a more expensive list, he places T. Rowe Price, Dreyfus and Pioneer Group.    American Capital last week reported flat fourth-quarter profit although earnings were higher for the year. James Green, chief financial officer, attributed the flat earnings to lower sales. In the fourth period, sales of the giant American Capital Government Securities Fund slowed after its dividend was trimmed. Because lower interest rates curbed the fund's earning ability, the firm cut the dividend -- a condition Mr. Green expects similar funds may soon have to consider. He said the firm also spent more to increase its distribution network. To protect its asset base by adding balance to the long-term fund weight, the firm created a short-term government fund, he added.    ---          Profits of Some Public Mutual Fund Firms                                PER-SHARE    AVERAGE TRADING                    PERIOD      EARNINGS   VOLUME (December) American         Year ended,   $1.53 vs.      17,638 shares  Capital          Dec. 31,       $1.10  Management       1986  andamp; Research  Inc.
