Reagan was asked at a news conference whether he had consideredaiding the African National Congress or other groups opposing thePretoria government since his administration has aided guerrillasfighting oppression in other countries.   ``No, we have not involved ourselves in that, other than thingssuch as the sanctions and so forth,'' Reagan said. ``We have triedour best to be persuasive in this very difficult problem.''   He was asked what the difference was between South Africa andother countries where the United States is supporting ``freedomfighters.''   ``The difference is that we don't have an armed insurrectiongoing as we have in some other countries and we have a greatdivision even among the people who are being oppressed,'' he said.``It's a tribal policy more than it is a racial policy and that isone of the most difficult parts here.''   Reagan noted that the State Department had contacted the SouthAfrican government earlier Wednesday to object to the government'sbanning of anti-apartheid organizations.   ``They should be working toward a multiracial democracy and notoppressing political organizations there, and we've made ourfeelings clear about that,'' he said.   The State Department had said it was ``appalled'' by SouthAfrica's decision to ban political activity by the nation's largestanti-apartheid group and 17 other opposition organizations.   ``By acting to outlaw non-violent political activity of theseorganizations, the South African government has dealt a severe blowto efforts to achieve a a peaceful solution to South Africa'sproblems,'' State Department spokesman Charles Redman said.   He said the affected organizations represent the aspirations ofa broad cross section of the black community.   ``We are appalled by the announcement from the South Africangovernment today that it is effectively outlawing the activities ofa large number of organizations,'' Redman said, adding: ``This is agiant step backward for South Africa.''   Redman said Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker hadsummoned South Africa's ambassador to the State Department toregister ``shock and distress'' over the crackdown.</TEXT></DOC>
