Mr. Shultz, a soft-spoken Oklahoman who moved to GulfCanada as president and chief operating officer last fall,said in his first interview since joining the company that heaims to expand the company's operations abroad significantly,and challenge conventional wisdom by stepping up the searchfor what he believes are big undiscovered pools of oil andgas in heavily explored western Canada.</LP><TEXT>   The appointment of Mr. Shultz, 50 years old, to succeed S.Keith McWalter, 64, who also is retiring as chairman, wasn'tunexpected. But its timing clears the air about who will runa yet-to-be-named new company that the Reichmanns propose toform through the merger of Gulf Canada and a smaller concern,Home Oil Co. Both companies are based in Calgary, Alberta.   The proposed merger would create Canada's third-biggestoil producer and fifth-biggest natural gas producer, withassets of about five billion Canadian dollars (US$4.31billion).   Mr. Shultz, who has broad international experience in theupstream-exploration and production-sector of the oilbusiness, said he is particularly interested in adding a&quot;third leg&quot; to Gulf Canada's operations in north Africa andEurope, which would complement its activities in westernCanada and Indonesia.   He also said he is bullish on the prospects of bolsteringGulf Canada's diminishing reserves in western Canada, whereproduction and cash flow have also been hurt, promptingseveral bond rating concerns to downgrade the company's debtsecurities.   &quot;My impression of western Canada is that there's still alot of oil to be found,&quot; he said. &quot;It's not nearly as heavilydrilled as the U.S., where reserves have been added&quot; byfurther drilling at established fields.   About 50% of Gulf Canada's C$350 million exploration anddevelopment budget this year is earmarked for western Canada,with an additional 30% going to frontier projects, and therest dedicated to international activities.   Mr. Shultz, described by Joe B. Foster, his former boss atTenneco, as &quot;an aggressive guy and a good motivator&quot; wholikes being &quot;right in the middle of the fray,&quot; said it couldtake a decade for Gulf Canada's presence in north Africa andEurope to match its current profile in Indonesia. But he saidan acquisition in those regions &quot;is an option&quot; in the longerterm.   Despite criticism by analysts that Gulf Canada is overlywedded to frontier holdings that don't generate any cash flowand will be expensive to develop, Mr. Shultz said the companyis still committed to expanding its production in places suchas Canada's remote Beaufort Sea. But he said production thereprobably won't begin until after the year 2000.   &quot;If we're bearish on Beaufort, it's not because it doesn'thave potential,&quot; Mr. Shultz said. &quot;It's because of today'scost. For a company our size, it doesn't take many C$70million wells before you run out of money to put in it.&quot;   Details of the proposed merger with Home Oil, which hassignificant land holdings in western Canada, a better recordthan Gulf Canada of replacing reserves, and steady cash flowof about C$200 million annually, are expected to be disclosedin a few weeks.   Executives of Home Oil, a unit of Calgary-based InterhomeEnergy Inc., said they don't know what role they will play,if any, in the merged company. But people familiar with thecompanies, both inside and out, say there isn't any doubtthat Mr. Shultz has been tapped to lead Gulf Canada'ssuccessor.   Gulf Canada also named Robert Butler, a low-profilecompany director, to succeed Mr. McWalter as chairman.Analysts said they see the move as a possible &quot;interim&quot;appointment.</TEXT></DOC>
