Results are reported in the growth, processing,and characterization of single-crystal fibers, which have led to significantdemonstrations of fiber laser and nonlinear optical devices. Theoreticalwork originally undertaked to model fiber materials and device behaviorhas contributed to the development of the more-general concept of tailorednonlinear media. This concept, and the materials work toward understandingfiber-device processing, resulted in the development of new nonlinearmaterials, through the modification of existing materials or throughmicroscopic control of material structure during growth.</TEXT></DOC>
