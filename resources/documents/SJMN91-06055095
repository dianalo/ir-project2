It really is a hot item,&quot; says Mary Hamilton, vice presidentand fashion merchandising manager at Emporium, where watch prices start at $23and go to $35 (for one version with changeable bezels).;    The appeal?;   For people who owned one in the '60s, &quot;it reminds them of happier days,&quot;Hamilton says.;    But there's a larger market out there -- the &quot;contemporary,trend-driven customers who are always looking for a new item. They see these,they're a spoof, they're cheap and they're fun,&quot; says Hamilton, who owns aheart shape, rhinestone trimmed ring watch.;    &quot;I wore it to a dinner partyand it created quite a stir. People were curious about it,&quot; she says.;    AtMacy's, Hall has seen an &quot;interesting dichotomy&quot; in sales: &quot;It seems to beselling to the 18- to 25-year-olds as well as a dressy customer that's older.It's an unusual thing to sell to both markets.&quot;;    Carol Darby, who owns anaccounting firm in Los Gatos, bought her ring watch at Adornme in Campbell inDecember. She says when she checks the time, &quot;I get some rather surprisedlooks and then they want to look at the watch.&quot;;    Nina Boyd, a San Joseproperty manager who bought a heart-shaped ring watch with rhinestone trim twoweeks ago at the Phoenix Gallery, says her ring is &quot;a conversation piece. It'sfun and it's cute.&quot;;    Sabatino says her ring watch got as much attention asshe did when she was recently rushed to emergency at Kaiser Hospital during anasthma attack. &quot;I'm suffocating and choking to death and eight nurses wantedto know where I got my watch,&quot; she says jokingly.;    Retailers are quick tocredit Timex with reviving ring watches when it introduced &quot;Ringlets&quot; -- agold-tone quartz watch with a simulated mother-of-pearl dial and an expansionband -- late last year. More than 40,000 of the Timex watches sold at $23 aring, making it the No. 1 Christmas item in both store and catalog sales.;   &quot;By Mother's Day, we'll have passed the $1 million sales mark,&quot; says SusieWatson, public relations manager for Timex.;    Watson attributes the salessuccess to the watch not &quot;taking itself too seriously. It's straightforward,it looks like a toy and it's meant to look like a toy. It's humorous, notserious jewelry.&quot;;    Although Timex was first out of the fad's starting gate,the company now has plenty of competition from other manufacturers, includingCenere and Digits. Timex is sticking to a single style, but others areproducing the ring watches with heart, oval and round faces. Some are styledto resemble status watches such as Rolex, Gucci or Cartier, while others arefrankly fun with rhinestones floating in liquid around the bezel.;    Ringwatches are cyclical in popularity, says Watson. Sotheby's Auction House inNew York, she says, once sold a turn-of-the-century ring in the shape &quot;of alittle enameled bee with wings that slipped open to show a watch.&quot;;    Likeany fashion fad, it's uncertain how long this revival will last.;    &quot;The lasttime we had ring watches at Christmas, they sold extremely well and thendropped dead,&quot; recalls Hall. &quot;I'd anticipate this will be a fast item, butit's interesting it's selling so well after Christmas. . . . It could last ayear, which is a relatively long time for a novelty watch.&quot;;    Watson is morepessimistic, predicting the fad will play out by summer: &quot;Then we'll come upwith the next hot item.&quot;; S.F. Alta closes;  The San Francisco branch store ofSan Jose-based Alta has closed just five months after opening.;    &quot;The timingwas bad in terms of economic conditions and the war,&quot; says Susan McCarthy,co-owner with Kim Cox.;    The two-level, 1,500-square-foot store -- down theblock from Union Square giants Neiman Marcus, Macy's and I. Magnin -- offeredan airy environment for women's contemporary clothing by Cox and McCarthy aswell as other designers.;    The first Alta opened on Lincoln avenue in theWillow Glen area of San Jose seven years ago. A second Alta, owned inpartnership with Rhonda Lackman, opened in the Fairmont Hotel in downtown SanJose two years ago.;    Merchandise remaining from the final San Franciscosale will be brought to the two San Jose locations, McCarthy says.;    Whilethe experience has been a disappointment for McCarthy and Cox, they aren'truling out another try -- perhaps in a location closer to San Jose.;    &quot;Rightnow we're tired and discouraged, but we ain't dead yet,&quot; McCarthy says.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mary Gottschalk column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910224  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3L  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  873  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday February 24, 199100055095,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
