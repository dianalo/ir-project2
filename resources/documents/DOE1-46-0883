<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-46-0883 </DOCNO><TEXT>Nondestructive wideband rf beam diagnostics, designed for use in the IUCFCooler storage ring, are being used in the cyclotron beam lines. Wallgap monitors monitor the beam microscopic time structure, macroscopictime structure, and phase with respect to the main synthesizer; electrostaticpickup electrodes monitor the beam position and intensity. The signalprocessing and rf-interference-elimination techniques which allow thesemonitors to operate with beam intensities as low as 10 nA are described.The performance limitations for rf pickups in low energy, low intensityaccelerators, and possible methods for using the powerful synchronousdetection techniques with nonbunched beams are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
