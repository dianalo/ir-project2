But the agency's quarterly survey of 12,072 commercialbanks also contains more bad news for banks and the economy.While total earnings rose, net operating income beforeextraordinary gains and sales of investment securities fellslightly to $3.5 billion.</LP><TEXT>   And lending continued to shrink despite Bushadministration efforts to encourage banks to make more creditavailable. Total loans and leases outstanding slipped to$2.06 trillion from $2.11 trillion a year ago. Next week,supervisors from the four federal bank regulatory agenciesare meeting in Baltimore to review a series of initiativesand rule interpretations designed to spur real-estatelending.   The report shows a banking system continuing to strugglewith problems created by sharp declines in real-estatevalues. Banks in the Northeast and the Southwest remain thehardest hit, but banking conditions now are worsening thefastest on the West Coast, the report shows. Despite thegenerally low profit level, almost 89% of the nation'scommercial banks are making a profit, and 58% of the banksreported higher earnings for the September quarter.   For the second quarter in a row, the volume of noncurrentloans and leasesthose that are 90 days past due -- fell.However, all of the decline to $80.5 billion in the thirdquarter from $83 billion in the second reflected the impactof bank failures and the FDIC's assumption of bad loans fromthose failures.   Nevertheless, the FDIC said that &quot;the absence of growth innoncurrent loans in the third quarter could result in lowerprovisioning for loan losses&quot; in the fourth quarter, whichcould allow a rise of earnings from last year's unusually low$1.4 billion in the December quarter.   Commercial bank capital rose by $3.7 billion in the thirdquarter to $230.5 billion, a sign that banks are building alarger cushion against failure. The ratio of equity capitalto assets remained stable at 6.71% for the second quarter ina row, the highest level since 1975.   The financial picture for savings banks is considerablybleaker, although the thirdquarter loss for the the nation's445 federally insured savings banks shrank to $344 millionfrom $776 million a year ago.   One reason for the improvement was that 13 savings bankswith average assets of more than $1 billion failed during thepast year, removing some big moneylosers from the survey.Almost 34% of savings banks, which hold most of their assetsin real-estate loans, continue to post losses. Nevertheless,51% of the savings banks showed earnings gains.   The number of commercial banks on the FDIC's problem list-- those most likely to fail -- stood at 1,005 on Sept. 30,up 30 from the start of the quarter. During the thirdquarter, the number of savings banks on the problem list roseto 76 from 58.</TEXT></DOC>
