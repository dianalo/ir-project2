Three months ago, the 24-hour news service Cable NewsNetwork International and the sports network ESPNInternational announced the expansion of broadcast servicesin Asia under an agreement to lease space on Indonesia'sPalapa satellite. But the new service -- bringing news andsports programming into hotels and homes throughout SoutheastAsia on a subscription basis -- is still on hold and thebroadcasters are considering other options.</LP><TEXT>   The two plan to share satellite space, but will operateindependently. CNN is a unit of Turner Broadcasting SystemInc.; ESPN is 80%-owned by Capital Cities/ABC Inc.   CNN and ESPN want to send their broadcast signals toPalapa from a ground station in Indonesia, but governmentauthorities have refused to comply and have refused toexplain their decision, according to Andrew Brilliant, ESPN'ssenior vice president and general manager. &quot;We don'tunderstand why the government is resisting. It's a bigmystery to us,&quot; he said in a phone interview from Jakarta,Indonesia.   Even so, Mr. Brilliant said he was confident that theservice will come on line by mid-1992. &quot;The only question isfrom where&quot; to link with the satellite, he said.   Officials of Indonesia's Information Department, one ofthe government bodies responsible for the decision, couldn'tbe reached for comment.   Peter Gontha, a director of Bimantara Citra Group, whichwas selected by the two broadcasters to assist in marketingand distributing the new service, said about the problem:&quot;It's a pity Indonesia doesn't allow it. We see foreignexchange going to other countries,&quot; referring to spendingassociated with the broadcasting business.   On Thursday, ESPN and CNN announced the selection of theirpartner in the project, PT Matahari Lintas Cakrawala. Thecompany is a unit of Bimantara, which is led by the secondson of Indonesia's President Suharto.   The U.S. broadcasters are faced with finding anothergovernment in Asia willing to provide a ground station.&quot;We're looking at several markets in the region and we hopeto make an announcement shortly,&quot; Mr. Brilliant said.   But analysts familiar with Asia's rigid regulatoryframework in the area of broadcasting and telecommunicationssay finding a government willing to assist CNN and ESPN couldbe difficult.   CNN and ESPN currently deliver their programming to Asiaon a satellite operated by the InternationalTelecommunications Satellite Organization, or IntelSat, basedin Washington, D.C. The CNN signal can be received by anyonein Asia with a satellite dish that is at least 7.5 meters indiameter. The ESPN signal is encoded and is available only toviewers who pay for the service. &quot;We intend to utilize{IntelSat} to hotels until such time as we can utilizePalapa,&quot; Mr. Brilliant said.   Both groups have expressed an interest in expanding theirbroadcast service in Asia as more powerful satellites becomeavailable. Palapa covers much of Southeast Asia and transmitsa signal that can be received by anyone owning a dish assmall as 2.5 meters in diameter. However, in accordance withIndonesian broadcasting laws and in an attempt to cut down onthe number of hotels that get service without paying for it,the U.S. broadcasters plan to scramble the Palapa signal.   In a written response from CNN's headquarters in Londonlast month, a company spokeswoman said CNN had complied withall Indonesian regulatory guidelines. CNN has refused toacknowledege Indonesian bureaucratic tangles, insteadpointing to purely technical hurdles for stalling the newservice. However, the CNN spokeswoman did say that sitesoutside Indonesia are under consideration.</TEXT></DOC>
