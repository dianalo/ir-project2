It was the beginning of the end for the career of R. FosterWinans, a Wall Street Journal reporter who played a key role inwhat would become one of the most publicized insider tradingconspiracies in history.   A day after the TIE alarm, a negative story about the companyappeared in Winans' ``Heard on the Street'' column, which made thestock tumble even more.   ``It looked like it was intentionally made to do a job on TIE,''said Jay S. Bono, head of the Amex stock watch unit, wheresuspicions arose that something was seriously wrong.   Shortly thereafter, the Amex computer sounded the alarm aboutKey Pharmaceuticals shares, which were falling in heavy volume. Afew days later, a negative story about Key appeared in the``Heard'' column and TIE pattern repeated itself.   ``Then we alerted our surveillance department, saying, `This isamazing. Definitely look at this sucker,'' Bono recalled.   Amex investigators began checking records to determine whichbrokerages had been active in TIE and Key in the days before the``Heard'' columns appeared.   Their inquiries showed significant trading was done by Peter N.Brant, then a star trader for Kidder Peabody andamp; Co., and two ofBrant's friends, Kenneth P. Felis, and David W.C. Clark.   Before TIE and Key fell, they had been aggressively buying ``putoptions'' on the stocks, entitling them to sell at a certain pricewithin a specified time. The options soared in value when thestocks declined.   Securities and Exchange Commission investigators were alerted,and eventually the Journal's senior management. It was almostcertain that Brant, Felis and Clark had known the pre-publicationcontents of the ``Heard'' column.   Faced with exposure, Winans told the SEC of a secret arrangementunder which he would leak advance word of the ``Heard'' column toBrant and the broker would share the trading profits he made withWinans and Winans' male lover, David J. Carpenter.   All were prosecuted for insider trading.   In a book about the conspiracy, Winans wrote that none of theparticipants had been aware market stock watchers would be alertedby their trading, especially Brant, who had ``muscled his way intoTIE like a refugee trying to catch the last helicopter out ofSaigon.''   In hindsight, Winans wrote, ``fewer people would have noticedwhat Peter was doing if he'd hired a skywriter.''   Despite the success of such surveillance in the Winans case,market officials concede other instances of blatant abuse can behard to identify. A good example was the insider trading done byIvan F. Boesky, a notorious speculator who was exposed byco-conspirator Dennis B. Levine.   Using secret tips about impending takeovers supplied by Levine,a former investment banker, Boesky made millions of dollars buyacquiring stocks of acquisition targets.   ``Boesky was not a name that was foreign to us; in fact we hadtracked a number of trades by Ivan Boesky over a long period oftime,'' said Donald J. Solodar, head of the New York Stock Exchangestock watch unit.   ``But it's like seeing a woodsman in the forest,'' Solodar said.``We expected him to be there. Because as a big player, we knew andwere able to see he was in many deals, many times. And there was nodiscernible pattern.''   NYSE stock watchers had better luck with Levine, who did all hisillicit trading under a phony name through an account at theBahamas branch of Bank Leu International Ltd., a Swiss bank.   Solodar said his analysts forwarded to the SEC about two dozensuspicious trading patterns over a period of several years thatoriginated from the Bank Leu account. SEC investigators used thatinformation to help identify Levine.   ``Beyond Bank Leu, because of a jurisdictional problem, we hadto rely on the SEC,'' Solodar said. ``But we do take partialcredit.''
