Background</ITAG>The DOE is developing the WIPP near Carlsbad in southeastern New Mexicoas a deep geologic repository for retrievably-stored and newly-generatedtransuranic (TRU) radioactive waste from various DOE defense program facilities.The repository has been excavated from a bedded salt formation 2150 feetbelow the land surface. The WIPP lands are under the jurisdiction of andmanaged by the U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management(BLM). The BLM is a ``cooperating agency'' (see 40 CFR Part 1501.6) inthe development of the SEIS. The DOE has submitted to the BLM an applicationfor withdrawal of the WIPP site lands from the public domain.Congress authorized the DOE to build the WIPP to demonstrate the safe disposalof radioactive wastes resulting from its national defense activities. Since1970, all defense-generated TRU wastes have been stored at various DOEdefense facilities using methods that facilitate retrieval. Continued storageat these facilities has raised public concerns about health and environmentalprotection. In addition, the filling of available storage capacity forradioactive waste at certain sites may hamper defense production operationsvital to national security.DOE published the FEIS for the WIPP (DOE/EIS-0026) in October 1980, followedby the Record of Decision (ROD) in January 1981 (46 FR 9162). Subsequently,DOE proceeded with construction of the WIPP facility.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Supplement Preparation</ITAG>On February 17, 1989, the DOE announced (54 FR 7251) its intent to preparea supplement to the WIPP FEIS to reflect proposed changes in the project,and new information, assumptions, or methods of analysis since publicationof the FEIS. The draft SEIS assesses potential environmental consequencesof the current proposed action and reasonable alternatives. The post-FEISchanges and information considered in the SEIS fall mainly in the followingareas:<T3>Changes in the sources of TRU wastes. </T3>In the 1980 FEIS, only TRUwastes from the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory and Rocky Flats Plantwere analyzed for disposal in the WIPP. Since then, the DOE has proposedthat TRU wastes from two other defense facilities, Hanford Operations andthe Savannah River Plant, would be disposed of at the WIPP. The potentialimpacts of transport to WIPP, and emplacement of waste from six additionalfacilities, are also analyzed in the SEIS.<T3>Changes in the volume of TRU waste inventory. </T3>The DOE estimatesa smaller volume of TRU waste because of a refinement in inventory samplingmethods; a change in the definition of TRU waste; changes to the WIPP WasteAcceptance Criteria; and anticipated facility waste treatment process modifications.<T3>Changes in the composition of the TRU waste inventory. </T3>The inventoryof TRU wastes now includes high-curie and high-neutron wastes, and DOEno longer proposes to conduct tests at WIPP using high-level wastes.<T3>Consideration of hazardous chemical constituents of the inventory.</T3>Hazardous chemical constituents in the radioactive waste inventory(which, together, are referred to as ``mixed'' wastes) were not consideredin the 1980 FEIS, but are assessed in the SEIS. The hazardous chemicalconstituents of this mixed waste constitute a small fraction of the totalwaste and consist primarily of lead from radiation shielding and residualorganic solvents.<T3>Changes in transportation modes, routes, and packaging. </T3>In theFEIS, DOE anticipated using a mixed transport mode (75% train and 25% truck).The SEIS considers transport by truck (100 percent) and ``maximum'' train(i.e., train transport from eight facilities and, because they lack railheads, truck transport from Los Alamos National Laboratory, and the NevadaTest Site). The design of the ``contact-handled'' TRU waste packaging haschanged from the Type A (TRUPACT-I) container, proposed in 1980, to theType B (TRUPACT-II) container to be certified by the Nuclear RegulatoryCommission.<T3>Implementation of a Test Phase. </T3>DOE is proposing to conduct aTest Phase to reduce uncertainties associated with two factors that mayaffect repository performance_gas generation and brine in-flow_and to demonstrateeffective waste handling procedures.The SEIS analyzes DOE's proposed action and two alternatives, one of whichis a ``no action'' alternative required by the Regulations of the Councilon Environmental Quality (40 CFR 1502.14(d)). The proposed action consistsof two parts: a Test Phase and a Disposal Phase. The Test Phase would lastapproximately five years, during which a maximum of 10 percent of the facilitydesign capacity for waste would be brought to the WIPP and emplaced undergroundin a retrievable manner. (The DOE expects to use less than 10 percent ofcapacity, but evaluates 10 percent in the SEIS for purposes of boundingenvironmental impacts.) If the Test Phase results in a determination thatWIPP satisfies environmental and operational safety requirements, the DisposalPhase would follow. The DOE will not use the WIPP as a permanent wasterepository unless and until there is a determination, based on the accumulatedscientific and operational data, that waste operations and disposal atWIPP comply with the Environmental Protection Agency's public health andenvironmental standards (40 CFR Part 191), and with other applicable Federal,State, and local requirements.The Test Phase is designed for two purposes: to obtain information relevantto assessing the long-term performance of WIPP, and to demonstrate DOE'sability to perform safely the operations necessary to transport waste to,and emplace waste in the WIPP. The Test Phase would involve tests of differentscales, or sizes, designed to collect data underground, in conditions towhich emplaced waste would be subjected if the facility should become operational.The second alternative action analyzed in the SEIS is to conduct only thosetests described in the proposed action that can be performed at a locationother than underground at WIPP until there is a determination of compliancewith regulatory requirements. The ``bin-scale'' tests proposed to be conductedwith TRU waste in the WIPP underground facility would be conducted at alocation other than underground at WIPP. The tests would be conducted ina specially-engineered above-ground facility designed for this purpose.In effect, this alternative is for a Test Phase without waste emplacedin the WIPP underground. <ITAG tagnum="84">III.
