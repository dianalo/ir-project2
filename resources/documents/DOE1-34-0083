Experiments were performed usinga bench scale apparatus and also a commercially available rotary desiccantunit. Three parameters were evaluated to study the control capabilitiesof desiccants to reduce indoor pollutant concentrations: (1) impact ofair constituent's concentration level; (2) desiccant material; and (3)thermal regeneration capabilities of desiccants. It is concluded thatdesiccants can be used as a component of indoor pollution control systems.</TEXT></DOC>
