(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gov. Gaston Caperton, elected on apledge to straighten out West Virginia's troubled economy, proposeda massive borrowing program to allow the state to pay its overduebills and build new schools.   Caperton, fresh from a special legislative session that gave him$392 million in tax increases, asked the Legislature on Monday forauthority to borrow up to $765 million more.   ``Let there be no mistake _ the people of this state need nolonger despair over the financial condition of West Virginia becausethis governor, and this Legislature, will pay their bills on time,''Caperton said to applause from a joint session of the Senate andHouse of Delegates.   In his first State of the State address, the Democrat presentedlawmakers with a proposed $1.781 billion budget for 1989-90, withbudget cuts averaging 4.5 percent for all state agencies excepteducation, health and human services.   The current state budget is $1.464 billion. The state deficit isprojected to be $260 million by June 30 and $376 million by nextyear.   Caperton defeated three-term Gov. Arch Moore last year in acampaign that focused on Moore's handling of the state's economy,which has been battered in recent years by widespread unemployment,a slump in the coal industry and cuts in federal assistance.   During Moore's last year in office, Standard andamp; Poor's imposed anemergency ``financial watch'' on West Virginia, the state's largestschool system threatened to close down and the state Supreme Courtdeclared the state budget unconstitutional because it threatenedWest Virginia's tenuous financial stability.   Caperton asked for 5 percent pay raises for public schoolteachers and state workers beginning Jan. 1, but only if the statecan save $40 million to $45 million in the first six months of thefiscal year to pay for them. He also endorsed a plan to merge WestVirginia and Marshall universities.   The governor said he wants authority to borrow up to $500 millionfor school construction.   He proposed borrowing funds to pay $85 million in backloggedinsurance claims and repay a $50 million loan from the stateconsolidated investment fund.   In addition, he said he wants to borrow $130 million, to berepaid through tolls, as part of a plan to replace the West VirginiaTurnpike with the West Virginia Parkway Economic Development andTourism Authority.   Caperton also proposed a constitutional amendment eliminating theelected posts of agriculture commissioner, secretary of state andtreasurer in 1992.</TEXT></DOC>
