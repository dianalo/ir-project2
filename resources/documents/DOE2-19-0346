The nationalproduction quota of crude oil from July to September 1987 decided inthe assembly is as follows (per day): Iran: 23,690,000 barrels, SaudiArabia: 4,343,000 barrels, Nigeria: 1,301,000 barrels, etc. Each quotais a little bit bigger than that of the last time, and the total amountof all 13 OPEC countries is 16,600,000 barrels. These figures show acompromise between the radicalists and the moderates. Iraq did not acceptits quota and plans to increase its production. As to the oil price,OPEC strongly confirmed to keep the price at 18 dollars per 10 thousandbarrels. The biggest problem for the stable supply of oil in the worldafterward is the Iran-Iraq War which is becoming increasingly intricate.Japan, the US, and Europe rely on the Strait of Hormuz very much andwhether the war grows more intense or ends will influence the oil priceconsiderably.
