Like many British concerns based in Hong Kong, Cathay and its parent, SWIRE PACIFIC LTD., face the challenge of continuing successful operations after the British colony reverts to Chinese control in 1997. Michael Miles, chairman of both Swire and Cathay, said the new relationship with China International Trust andamp; Investment Corp. &quot;is a key one, recognizing the political realities and the long-term future of the airline, and that is what is paramount in our view.'    In addition to cementing relations with China, the agreement bolsters Cathay's position against the colony's other carrier, Hong Kong Dragon Airlines. Dragonair's own ties to Peking had been viewed as giving the carrier a potential long-term edge over Cathay. </TEXT></DOC>
