Genscher replied: ``It is an expression of the strength offreedom and democracy all over Germany that our Germans ... were ina position, by peaceful means'' to open the wall.   He said ``the German Democratic Republic (East Germany's formalname) is on the way really to become a democratic republic,''although he added that this depends on free elections in thecommunist state in the year ahead.   Genscher expressed ``our great gratitude for the support, thehelp and the firmness of the American nations in the past decades.''   ``It's the result of a very clear policy of the West advocatingfreedom and democracy all over the Europe,'' he said as Bushadmired the nearly foot-long gray brick that the minister had givenhim.   ``We will do nothing to undermine this process or even to weakenthis process'' of reform throughout Eastern Europe, said Genscher.``We do not look for advantage ... when they have to facedifficulty.''   Genscher, asked about modernizing nuclear forces in WestGermany, said, ``I think this is a time to be discussed in '92 aswas agreed in the NATO communique.''   Genscher had been pressing for talks to reduce short-rangenuclear arms last spring before the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization rallied behind Bush's arms proposals.   The West Germany official told reporters after the meeting thathe was impressed with the ``complete agreement'' he shared withBush and his advisers on how to approach Eastern Europe at this``really historic moment'' of developing democracies.   Genscher said it was important that the Soviet Union and EastEuropean countries understand that the Western allies ``will do allwe can to guarantee this stability'' and will do nothing from theoutside to disturb the move to freer societies.   The meeting with the West German minister came as Bush preparesfor next week's shipboard summit with Soviet President Mikhail S.Gorbachev off Malta.   The president will meet with another ally, British PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher, at Camp David, Md., on Friday.   Bush won loud applause from audiences in Rhode Island on Mondaywhen he promised to ``keep my eyes wide open'' and approach thetalks with caution.   ``I sometimes get needled a little about being cautious andprudent, but somehow I think that's what a president of the UnitedStates ought to do when you go to meet ... a Soviet leader,'' Bushsaid.   Speaking today to the National Association of State Universitiesand Land-Grant Colleges, Bush urged college presidents to ``take astand'' and tell their students ``that society will not toleratethe use of drugs.''   He appealed for help in drafting new national goals foreducation, and also urged the administrators to take to heart anadmonition from Princeton University President Harold Shapiro thatcolleges must ``be much more selective about what we do'' to keepthe costs of higher education within reasonable bounds.   Bush spent Monday in Chicago and Providence to boost thefortunes of two pro-choice Republican congresswomen, Reps. LynnMartin and Claudine Schneider, who have their eyes on Senate racesnext year.   But immediately after singing Schneider's praises in Providence,he got aboard Air Force One and for a second time vetoed a Districtof Columbia appropriations bill because of abortion fundingprovisions he found ``unacceptable.''   Schneider, who has not yet declared her candidacy for the seatnow occupied by Democratic Sen. Claiborne Pell, was a guest on thepresidential aircraft and she told reporters, ``I'm disappointed.''   Schneider, Martin and two other pro-choice GOP congresswomen metwith Bush last Tuesday to, in Schneider's words, ask him to makeclear there was room within the GOP for abortion rights supporters.   Schneider said they asked him ``to find a way where he couldstill maintain the integrity of his own position on abortionwithout becoming involved in the minutiae of legislation, makingdeterminations of who does what with the money when.''   ``Clearly he has sent that message by coming up to Rhode Islandon my behalf today,'' she said.   But his second D.C. appropriations veto _ his fourthabortion-related veto in recent weeks _ indicated that Bush isadamantly opposed to any public funding for abortion, except tosave the life of the mother.   The District bill would have used federal Medicaid funds forabortions only in those circumstances, but would have allowed thedistrict to pay for abortions on demand for poor women with localtaxpayers' dollars.   But under the district's home rule law, even its locallygenerated tax dollars are subject to approval by Congress and thepresident, and Bush said he wanted no part of funding abortions``with no restriction whatsoever.''   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said House Speaker ThomasFoley had requested quick presidential action ``so Congress couldhave time to act on it before the Thanksgiving recess.''   Fitzwater announced earlier that Bush will stay over in European extra day after the Dec. 2-3 meeting with Gorbachev to brief theNATO allies in Brussels.   At a fund-raising reception for Rhode Island Gov. Edward DiPretein a tent outside his Cranston, R.I., mansion, Bush predicted,``It's going to be a historic meeting,'' but quickly added, ``Idon't want to see overpromises coming from it.''   But he said, ``We are living in times where the potential forpeace and reduced tensions has never been better.''</TEXT></DOC>
