In a move they characterize as a &quot;liberalization,&quot; big Japanese banks want to float the short-term prime rate, linking it to free-moving, money-market rates instead of the discount rate. This would improve their profitability but raise the cost of borrowing to their clients.    &quot;We are in a very unfavorable situation, but we see higher rates as more or less inevitable,&quot; says Shigekazu Ogura, general manager of finance at Mitsui andamp; Co., a finance-reliant trading company with total borrowings of nearly 2 trillion yen ($15.8 billion). &quot;Of course we will resist it.&quot;    The dispute signals new pressures on Japan's money-gushing banks. It also underscores the increasing financial sophistication of corporations here, which warn that they may be forced to rely more on alternative sources of funding, such as Japan's budding but relatively restricted commercial-paper market.    The clash of goals is rare in postwar Japan, where consensus has enabled banks and industry to flourish. Indeed, major banks and their big clients, who typically maintain extremely cozy relations, insist they eventually will work out a compromise.    So far, the banks haven't directly confronted their big clients with their plan to create a new, floating prime-lending rate. In interviews, however, they say they will broach the subject formally by year end. &quot;Our prime rate is too low,&quot; says a senior manager at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Japan's biggest bank. &quot;Changing it is inevitable.&quot;    At the moment, Japan's short-term prime lending rate is fixed to the official discount rate, the interest rate at which the central Bank of Japan lends to commercial banks. In theory, the banks should earn a comfortable amount on the spread between the discount and prime rates, since the two are tied and always move in tandem.    But both rates have been at their current levels since February 1987. That's mainly because the Bank of Japan, which sets the official discount rate, has focused monetary policy on volatile, short-term interbank rates and has tended to view any adjustment in the discount rate as a signal of sweeping policy change. The discount rate now stands at 2.5%, while the short-term prime lending rate banks is fixed at 3.375%.    In the meantime, though, interbank rates -- the varying amount banks charge each other for short-term loans -- have moved sharply, as have the money-market interest rates banks pay out for large-scale deposits. As a result, banks' overall profit margins have been eroded.    Terms of the new rate haven't been clearly defined, but bankers estimate that it would stand at about 4.5% at current money-market rates.    There is another motivation for banks to change their prime rate. Last July, the Bank for International Settlements set out new capital-adequacy standards for major banks. In essence, the rules will require commercial banks to maintain capital and reserves equal to at least 8% of total assets as of the end of March 1993.    Confronted by that requirement, Japan's enormous banks -- nine of the world's ten biggest banks measured by assets are Japanese -- have been raising new capital aggressively, issuing new stock and convertible bonds in markets all over the world. But the banks also are looking for ways to trim their assets, which have been expanding at an annual average growth rate of more than 10%.    One quick solution is to change Japan's lending-rate structure, especially if the change effectively boosts interest rates. Higher rates discourage prospective borrowers.    Altering Japan's prime rate offers a hidden advantage: cleaning up the balance sheets of Japanese banks. Currently, as a way of effectively bolstering interest rates, the banks often require major borrowers to take out bigger loans than they need and deposit what they aren't using in low-interest savings accounts. As a result, most big Japanese companies estimate their effective borrowing costs at about 4%, well above the current prime rate.    While counterbalancing deposits lift margins, it also inflates balance sheets. So if a bank can charge higher rates directly, it could slash a significant amount from its balance sheets.    Bankers hope to lessen the pain their clients suffer from higher borrowing costs by tying acceptance of the new prime rate to give-backs in fee-based services, such as foreign-exchange trading or advisory services.    &quot;We can figure out the profitability of individual clients by taking into account all the business we do for them,&quot; says Teisuke Kitayama, a senior vice president and deputy general manager at Mitsui Bank. &quot;That way, we can negotiate with a client how to improve our profitability overall.&quot;    Big corporate borrowers aren't sure what kind of compromise can be reached but generally believe there will be an amicable settlement between banks and their borrowers. &quot;If the new prime rate means to increase our borrowing cost, then we cannot accept it,&quot; says Yoji Yoshioka, manager of capital and money-market activities at Mitsubishi Corp., a trading company. &quot;But there doesn't have to be an adverse effect.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
