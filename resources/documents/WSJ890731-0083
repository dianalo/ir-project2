The anxiety is especially evident in the arguments that have erupted lately among securities analysts over the outlook for MCI Communications, a longtime glamour stock.    A number of analysts argue that the market overreacted when Merrill Lynch analyst Joseph Bellace told clients recently he expects MCI's growth rate and operating profit margin to decline in the next several quarters. He reduced his rating on the giant telecommunications concern's stock to &quot;neutral&quot; from &quot;above average.&quot; The stock promptly dropped 1 5/8 last Monday to 35 5/8 on heavy volume.    Since then, however, the stock has rebounded to 39 7/8. &quot;I think MCI is dirt cheap,&quot; says Edward Greenberg of Morgan Stanley. He scoffs at any suggestion that the company -- which earlier reported that second-quarter profit more than doubled on a 31% revenue increase -- might be reversing course.    &quot;Of course MCI's growth is slowing,&quot; Mr. Greenberg says.&quot;But that's already built into the consensus earnings estimates. You can't expect the company to keep growing at the current rates forever.&quot;    Mr. Bellace says he didn't expect his remarks to be controversial. He points out that he didn't change his earnings estimates and says he remains positive on MCI in the long term. &quot;I just wanted to deliver the message to clients that MCI is in a transition phase,&quot; he says. &quot;The response has been too emotional.&quot;    His comments certainly seemed to provide the banana peel for MCI's already stumbling stock. In all, the stock price fell 4 1/4, or 10.7%, during five sessions.    Several factors were at work. Robert Morris III, a San Francisco-based Goldman Sachs analyst, said some investors scrambled to take profits on MCI's stock, which has gained an astonishing 76% since the end of 1988.    Lap Lee of Salomon Brothers speculates that some professional traders also sold shares after analysts failed to provide a boost for the stock by raising earnings estimates.    Although MCI shares have recovered since then and rose 1/2 Friday, no one is contending that MCI's revenue and earnings growth won't cool from their sizzling pace of recent years.    From a loss of $498 million in 1986, MCI sprang back to post a profit of $346 million last year. Revenue in that period ballooned 43% to $5.14 billion. Operating-profit margins jumped from 5.9% in 1987 to 15.9% in this year's second quarter. But analysts expect those margins to widen at a slower pace in the next 18 months.    Messrs. Lee and Morris remain bullish on the company, however. They haven't budged from earlier estimates, which MCI doesn't dispute, that the company will earn between $2.30 and $2.40 a share this year and between $3 and $3.30 a share in 1990.    If those projections are on target, MCI's net income will still be growing at a double-digit pace, and some analysts expect its earnings and revenue to grow faster than the average of the companies in the Standard andamp; Poor's 500 index. Sandamp;P last week cited MCI's &quot;rapidly improving cash flow&quot; in upgrading its subordinated debt to triple-B from double-B-plus.    With mighty American Telephone andamp; Telegraph as a competitor and United Telecommunications' US Sprint making inroads, MCI can't rest on its laurels. Last December, ATandamp;T and Sprint beat out MCI for shares of a big contract to overhaul the federal government's telephone system. Morgan Stanley's Mr. Greenberg says, &quot;Come the early 1990s, ATandamp;T will become a more effective competitor. Taking market share from them will be tougher.&quot;    ATandamp;T is definitely on the mind of Daniel Akerson, MCI's chief financial officer, who says confidently that MCI can continue to strip market share from ATandamp;T in the business, residential and data services markets. His weapons: new products and services, along with continuing improvements in MCI's telecommunications systems.    &quot;When we were spending billions in 1983 and 1984 on our telecommunications network, people thought we were crazy,&quot; he says. &quot;But that strategy is starting to bear fruit.&quot;    He says MCI hasn't run out of steam. He says revenue rose 32% in the first half despite a 6% general price decrease in the industry. Without the price cut, he says, revenue would have been up almost 40%, &quot;and that's indicative of the strength of the company.&quot; He says some analysts have &quot;misinterpreted the fundamental trends underlying the company.&quot;    ---   MCI Communications    (OTC; Symbol: MCIC)    Business: Telecommunications    Year ended Dec. 31, 1988:    Revenue: $5.14 billion    Net Income: $346 million; $1.23 a share    Second quarter, June 30, 1989:    Per-share earnings: 56 cents vs. 21 cents    Average daily trading volume:    1,794,737 shares    Common shares outstanding: 254 million    ---   Friday's Market Activity    The Nasdaq Composite Index edged up 0.34 to 452.82 on volume of nearly 129 million shares. Reflecting the market's biggest issues, the Nasdaq 100 Index rose 0.78 to 426.29 and the Nasdaq Financial Index improved 0.76 to 444.80. Sun Microsystems slid 1 1/2 to 14 3/4 on volume of seven million shares. It said it will report a substantial loss for its fourth quarter, which ended in June.    But the selling didn't spread to other technology stocks that had been getting hammered in the past week. In addition to MCI's gain, for example, Apple Computer rose 1/8 to 39 3/8.    Shares of McCaw Cellular, which has offered to buy LIN Broadcasting for $110 a share, tumbled 1 3/8 to 38, while LIN slipped 1/2 to 109 5/8. Merger talks between the two cellular communications concerns continue to be stalled.    Two new issues were actively traded. Newbridge Network closed at 11 1/2, up from its offering price of $10.50. A total of 3,750,000 shares was offered by the maker of digital networking products. Eagle Food Centers closed at 20 1/4, up 1/4 from the price at which it offered 3.7 million shares. H.M.S.S. gained 1 3/4 to 29 1/2, and another provider of home health care therapy, New England Critical Care, rose 2 1/8 to 35 3/8. Argonaut Group surged 2 7/8 to 60 7/8 after the insurance holding company declared an initial dividend of 25 cents a share and authorized the purchase of as many as two million of its common shares.    Psicor jumped 2 to 12 1/2 despite reporting that it earned 13 cents a share in its third quarter compared with 15 cents a share a year earlier. An article in Business Week magazine said the company's cardiovascular technology and services are increasingly in demand because of the growing number of heart operations and acquired immune deficiency syndrome cases. </TEXT></DOC>
