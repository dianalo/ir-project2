TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An Israeli think tank on Wednesday urgedthe government to negotiate with the PLO and said that with adequatesecurity arrangements, a Palestinian state would not pose a deadlythreat to Israel.   The report set off a ruckus in the government. The right-wingLikud bloc and the center-left Labor Party have governed Israel inan uneasy coalition since elections in July 1984 and again inNovember 1988 ended in stalemates.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, leader of the Likud, said thestudy undermines Israel's efforts to resist U.S. and Europeanpressures to talk with the PLO, Shamir spokesman Yossi Achimeir said.   But Finance Minister and Labor Party leader Shimon Peres calledthe study ``intelligent'' and said Israel must speak to Palestinianrepresentatives, Israel television said.   Joseph Alpher, director of the 20-member team that produced thestudy and a separate paper of recommendations, said, ``Israel canset conditions on its agreement, but it is going to have to talk tothe PLO to solve the problem under the present circumstances.''   The study by Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Center for StrategicStudies was sponsored by the American Jewish Congress and theAnti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith.   In the peace proposal entitled ``Toward A Solution,'' theindependent think tank proposed a lengthy period of autonomy for the1.7 million Palestinian residents of the occupied West Bank and GazaStrip as a precursor to possible statehood.   ``We are talking about a 10- to 15-year process that begins witha series of confidence-building measures and new concepts on thepart of both parties,'' Alpher said.   The 24-page proposal conflicts with government policy ruling outtalks with the PLO and rejecting any possibility of a Palestinianstate. The proposed transition period is considerably longer thanthe five-year interim period suggested by the 1978 Camp DavidAccords.   Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat advocatesan immediate turnover and predicted in a recent interview that aPalestinian state would emerge in two years.   The center recommended Israel should not commit itself to aPalestinian state in advance. But it urged Israel not rule out thepossibility, noting that with proper security arrangements theconcept of a Palestinian state was not a ``mortal danger'' to theJewish state.   To win Palestinian confidence, Israel would have to offercomprehensive self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, give upcontrol over most state land in occupied zones and stop buildingJewish settlements.   Palestinians would have to cease violent acts and terrorismagainst Israeli targets and accept that Palestinian refugees wouldnot be able to return to Israel.   In an interview, Alpher said the PLO also would have to agree toIsrael keeping some Arab land seized in the 1967 Middle East war andto limitations on the sovereignty of a new state, including Israel'scontrol of its airspace.   The 235-page study said 2.2 million of the world's 4.6Palestinians live in Arab states, half of them in teeming refugeecamps.   It says the sudden and unplanned movement of refugees to a newstate posed a serious danger of economic collapse, social chaos andrenewed guerrilla insurgency against Israel.   The center proposed that during an interim period Arab statesbegin resettling the camp residents on their own territory and thatonly a portion of the refugees move to a new Palestine state.   The study says the sudden separation of Israel and the West Bankwould cause economic hardship for both sides, with Israel losingworkers and an export market while 100,000 Palestinians would losetheir jobs in Israel.   An initial investment of up to $2.5 billion would be needed forbuilding basic industry, electricity, roads and a port in Gaza.About $2 billion would be needed annually for several years toprevent a drop in living standards, it said.   The study says Israel, which receives about $3 billion annuallyin U.S. aid, would need additional funds. Up to $10 billion would beneeded to resettle 20,000 Israeli settlers, withdraw Israeli troops,relocate military facilities and erect an electronic border fence.   The report's authors included an ex-director of militaryintelligence, a former head of the military government in the WestBank and a well-known conservative scholar.</TEXT></DOC>
