STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   East Germany's new leadership today declared anamnesty for all citizens accused of illegally trying to escape fromthe communist nation, a move expected to free several thousandpeople from prison.   The amnesty also would allow tens of thousands of East Germanswho have fled to West Germany through Hungary, Czechoslovakia andPoland in recent months to return home without facing criminalprosecution.   The announcement came a day after more than 100,000 peoplerallied in Dresden and other East German cities for democraticreform, and a Politburo member began talks with a leadingopposition group.   The amnesty, which also covers those who took part in illegalstreet protests, is the firmest step toward reform since Egon Krenzreplaced long-time leader Erich Honecker as Communist Party chiefon Oct. 18.   It was announced by the official news agency ADN, which said allprisoners affected would be freed by Nov. 30. Although East Germanydoes not release information on inmate numbers, Western sourcessaid the measure would affect thousands.   ADN said the amnesty covered all people accused of borderviolations through today.   Also today, the nation's legendary former intelligence chief,Markus Wolf, called for greater openness and expressed somesympathy for the refugees who headed West.   In an interview with party newspaper Neues Deutschland, Wolfsaid, ``the recovery of trust is demanded before we can developfurther,'' indicating Krenz may be open to loosening someconstraints on the media and free expression.   Late Thursday, the state-run ADN news agency reported the hugerally in Dresden and said 15,000 people also marched in Erfurt,25,000 in Rostock and 5,000 more in Gera.   Earlier, East Berlin Communist Party chief Guenter Schabowskitalked for two hours with scientists Jens Reich and SebastianPflugbeil, founding members of the group New Forum. It was thefirst time a member of the ruling Polituro met with the group, thelargest of the new organizations pushing for reform.   Communist authorities banned New Forum in September but havetolerated the group anyway.   Reich described the talks as ``open and constructive. Wepresented New Forum's concepts and ideas.''   He said Schabowski ``told us he wanted to begin a new politicalcourse and wanted to learn about the whole political spectrumhere.''   Reich, a molecular biologist at East Berlin's Academy ofSciences, said Schabowski assured him the government's interest intalks to solve the nation's problems ``was a real change and not atactical move.''   Reich and other New Forum leaders later addressed severalhundred people in an East Berlin church to explain the group's aimsand their talks with Schabowski.   East German television broadcast a special program on the churchmeeting. The television and ADN reports both marked a radicalchange from previous practice, when state-controlled media limitedthemselves to reporting only official party policy.   In staging rallies Thursday, demonstrators ignored an earlierappeal by Communist authorities for citizens not to protest in thestreets.   In Dresden, however, the demonstration appeared to have theofficial blessing of local Communist authorities.   At the open-air rally in the southern industrial city,opposition leaders and local Communist Party officials addressedthe crowd from a podium equipped with loudspeakers, ADN said.   Hans Modrow, the local party chief long believed to be a strongsupporter of reform, told the crowd a process had begun that wouldlead to ``revolutionary change,'' ADN said.   East Berlin's mayor, Erhard Krack, on Thursday invited``citizens interested in dialogue'' to a discussion at City Halland at the capital city's convention center on Sunday, ADN said.   East Germany's Federation of Lawyers called on the government toallow multi-candidate elections and demanded reform of the nation'slegal system.</TEXT></DOC>
