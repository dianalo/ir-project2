Cuba's deputy foreign minister, Raoul Roa Kouri, said the report``categorically denies'' U.S. charges that Cuban authorities tortureand execute opponents and imprison thousands of political prisoners.   Ambassador Armando Valladares, the chief U.S. delegate and aformer Cuban political prisoner, said the report ``indicates thatcivil, political, economic, and social rights are violated in Cubaevery day, in a systematic manner, almost without exception.''   The exchange over the 400-page report came during a debate beforethe United Nations Human Rights Commission. The document wascompiled by a six-member U.N. delegation, which visited Cuba lastyear in response to pressure by the United States to investigatealleged human rights abuse in that country.   The report, which was released Friday, included an extensive listof alleged human rights violations along with denials by Havana. Italso included official statistics on improvement in education andhealth care since that country's 1959 Marxist revolution.   The delegation, which was led by Alioune Sene, Senegal'sambassador to the United Nations, and included diplomats from allmajor regions, made no assessments or recommendations in the report.   It did, however, include questions on constitutional and legalmatters the group said had not been answered by Cuba.   The United States and several Western countries urged the group'smandate should be extended by the commission.   President Bush said Monday the report should begin a ``long-termeffort to bring about true and lasting changes in the Cubangovernment's performance on human rights.''   Several Western speakers, including Britain, West Germany,Belgium, Portugal and Spain, voiced concern at the Cuban humanrights situation. Spain's Mercedes Rico said while there was ``nopattern of massive, flagrant and systematic violation of humanrights,'' restrictions of fundamental freedoms were ``alarming.''   But several Third World and communist countries made plain theywere opposed to a new mandate for the group. Cuba has said that itwill not accept further scrutiny.   Roa Kouri said Cuba restricted civil rights to protect itselfagainst ``U.S. aggression.'' He said the mission's visit to Cuba inSeptember followed a stepped up U.S. ``psychological warfare'' afteryears of ``very limited results in efforts to destabilize and defeatthe revolution.''   Mexico's chief delegate Claude Heller said any assessment of theCuban situation should take into account the ``particularconditions'' confronting the country since the revolution, including``even death threats against its leaders.''</TEXT></DOC>
