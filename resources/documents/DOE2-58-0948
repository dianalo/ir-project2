More and morein these days, shotcrete is applied in mining, too. Due to its specialpractice of application, using of shotcrete method exposes to dangerthe staff, i.e. health injury has to be expected for them. Target ofthe research programme was to comprehend, to estimate, and to reducethe health affecting emissions (as there are dust, noise, vibrations)at the nozzle and the shotcrete machine. As the requirements for shotcretequality are also relevant as a structural member, this area was opposedin a rated manner to the emissions occurred. Tests have shown that theemissions are unavoidable but they can be reduced essentially. The problemscan be solved somewhat by measures taken concerning construction method,machinery, and operation. As the quality to obtain is independent fromthe air rate, reduction of air rate showed itself effective against dustdevelopment.</TEXT></DOC>
