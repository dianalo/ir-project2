The greenback was quoted late in Tokyo Tuesday at 135.95yen, below 136.00 yen late Monday in New York but up from135.70 yen late Friday in Tokyo. Tokyo markets were closedMonday to honor the Japanese emperor's birthday. U.S. andEuropean markets were closed yesterday for the Christmasholidays.</LP><TEXT>   The U.S. currency also finished in Tokyo at 1.5380 marks,lower than 1.5440 marks late Monday in New York but wellabove 1.5088 marks in Tokyo Friday.   In Tokyo early Wednesday, the dollar was trading at 136.28yen, and at about 1.5390 marks.   The main feature of Tuesday's trading was the mark'smodest firming against the yen, which traders attributed bothto profit-taking in the yen and short-covering of markpositions. The short-mark positions were acquired during theGerman currency's fall of roughly two yen following theresignation of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadzelate last week.   The German currency, thought to be the most vulnerableamong major currencies to instability in the Soviet Union,found support at around the 88.20-yen level, whereparticipants began the covering of short-mark positions. Tobe short a currency means, in essence, betting that thecurrency will fall.   Late in the Tokyo session, the mark was trading at 88.39yen, up from 88.08 late Monday in New York but well below89.93 yen in Tokyo Friday. The mark opened the Tokyo sessionTuesday at 88.05 yen.   Meanwhile, traders say the dollar continues to drawsupport from fears of war in the Persian Gulf, ahead of theapproaching Jan. 15 deadline set by the United Nations for apeaceful Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. The greenback is alsobenefiting from concern over possible political turmoil inthe Soviet Union. The dollar has traditionally served as a&quot;haven&quot; for investors in times of turmoil.   Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze, long a close ally ofPresident Mikhail Gorbachev, resigned from his post toprotest to what he called growing dictatorship in hiscountry.   On Monday, the dollar had gained in thin pre-holidaydealings in Europe and the U.S. as traders troubled by theMideast crisis and Soviet political instability moved tocover any short-dollar positions. The mark was the market'swallflower as participants abandoned long-mark positionsacross the board.   &quot;When you look at the political makeup in the Sovietsector and ask who's most susceptible, Germany comes out loudand clear,&quot; said Marc Cohen, vice president of corporateforeign exchange at Fuji Bank in New York, citing Germany'sproximity to and investments in the Soviet Union.   The Shevardnadze resignation &quot;tacked on a minimum of fivepfennigs,&quot; or 0.05 mark, to the dollar's trading range, saidJerry Egan, chief dealer at Bank of Boston in Boston. Thequestion now is whether that boost will serve as a catalystfor a larger dollar rally once the market returns to normalafter the year-end holidays.   European and U.S. trading institutions mostly operatedwith skeleton staffs and closed early for Christmas Eve. Inthese conditions, the effects of each transaction wereamplified, causing wider swings in exchange rates than wouldhave been seen in a more liquid market.   Although the market's lack of liquidity draws intoquestion the durability of the dollar's recent gains, manytechnical traders were calling the rally significant.   Mary Ingrassia, customer dealer at Bank of Tokyo in NewYork, said that since the U.S. currency broke and remainedabove 1.50 marks, participants have been viewing 1.55 marksas the next objective. The dollar stopped just shy of thatgoal Monday, hitting an intraday high of 1.5470 marks.   There was no gold trading on the Commodity Exchange in NewYork Monday or yesterday. Hong Kong markets were closedWednesday for a holiday.</TEXT></DOC>
