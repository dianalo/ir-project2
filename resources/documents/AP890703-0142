The United States Court ofAppeals for the Eight Circuit struck down several provisions of thestatute on the ground that they violated this court's decision inRoe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), and cases following it. We notedprobable jurisdiction and now reverse. ...   In June 1986, the governor of Missouri signed into law MissouriSenate Committee Substitute for House Bill No. 1596 (hereinafter Actor statute), which amended existing state law concerning unbornchildren and abortions.   The Act consisted of 20 provisions, 5 of which are now before thecourt. The first provision, or preamble, contains ``findings'' bythe state legislature that ``the life of each human being begins atconception,'' and that ``unborn children have protectable interestsin life, health, and well-being.'' The Act further requires that allMissouri laws be interpreted to provide unborn children with thesame rights enjoyed by other persons, subject to the federalConstitution and this court's precedents. Among its otherprovisions, the Act requires that, prior to performing an abortionon any woman whom a physician has reason to believe is 20 or moreweeks pregnant, the physician ascertain whether the fetus is viableby performing ``such medical examinations and tests as are necessaryto make a finding of the gestational age, weight, and lung maturityof the unborn child.'' The Act also prohibits the use of publicemployees and facilities to perform or assist abortions notnecessary to save the mother's life, and it prohibits the use ofpublic funds, employees, or facilities for the purpose of``encouraging or counseling'' a woman to have an abortion notnecessary to save her life.'' ...   Decision of this case requires us to address four sections of theMissouri Act: (a) the preamble; (b) the prohibition on the use ofpublic facilities or employees to perform abortions; (c) theprohibition on public funding of abortion counseling; and (d) therequirement that physicians conduct viability tests prior toperforming abortions. ...   The Act's preamble, as noted, sets forth ``findings'' by theMissouri legislature that ``the life of each human being begins atconception,'' and that `unborn children have protectable interestsin life, health, and well-being.'' The Act then mandates that statelaws be interpreted to provide unborn children with ``all therights, privileges, and immunities available to other persons,citizens, and residents of this state,'' subject to the Constitutionand this court's precedents. In invalidating the preamble, the Courtof Appeals relied on this court's dictum that ``a state may notadopt one theory of when life begins to justify its regulation ofabortions. It rejected Missouri's claim that the preamble was``abortion-neutral,'' and ``merely determined when life begins in anonabortion context, a traditional state prerogative.'' ...   In our view, the court of Appeals misconceived the meaning ...which was only that a state could not ``justify'' an abortionregulation otherwise invalid under Roe v. Wade on the ground that itembodied the state's view about when life begins. ...   It will be time enough for federal courts to address the meaningof the preamble should it be applied to restrict the activities ofappellees in some concrete way. Until then, this court ``is notempowered to decide ... abstract propositions, or to declare, forthe government of future cases, principles or rules of law whichcannot affect the result as to the thing in issue before it.'' Wetherefore need not pass on the constitutionality of the Act'spreamble. ...</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
