The recovered biomasswas scaled to determine the quality and quantity of material removed.The conventional system costs $15.51/m/sup 3/ and at present is uneconomicif biomass is to be used as a source of hog fuel. The integrated systemsperformed better and recovered biomass at costs ranging from $9.19 to9.62 m/sup 3/. The container system has the most promise and, with designand size changes to the system, has the potential of achieving recoverycosts of $5.00/m/sup 3/. Further development and test work is recommendedfor the container system. 8 figs., 27 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
