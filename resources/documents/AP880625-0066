Rangoon, where rioting erupted Tuesday, was calm althoughtraffic was lighter than normal today. A dusk-to-dawn curfewremained in force.   Residents contacted by telephone said classes had been suspendedat universities and secondary schools in Mandalay, the country'ssecond largest city, as well as Taunggyi, Moulmein, Pegu, Bassein,Myitkyina and Akyab.   The government imposed a series of restrictions hours afterstudents and other demonstrators clashed with police in Rangoonlast Tuesday. Over the next few days the protests spread to Pegu,located north of Rangoon; Moulmein, on the southeastern seacoast,and the Irrawaddy delta center of Bassein.   Residents in Moulmein said out-of-town students at theuniversity were quickly sent home on buses, airplanes and boats byauthorities. They also reported the arrest of several studentleaders.   There has been no comment to date on the disturbances in thegovernment-controlled media and no public announcement since June23 on the closure of the schools.   Although details were not available, authorities in Rangoonappeared to be searching for student leaders, most of whom havebeen expelled from schools and universities following a bloody riotin the capital last March.   The latest protests were sparked by the government closure ofthe Rangoon Arts and Science University where students last weekstaged a peaceful demonstration demanding release of arrestedstudents and the legalization of student unions.   Shouting anti-government slogans, thousands took to the streetsand battled police with rocks. The government announced that ninepersons were killed and 77 arrested in the third major violentprotest since last October.   The outbreak appears to reflect a widespread disillusionmentwith the 26-year-old regime of strongman Ne Win. His socialisteconomics have turned a once prosperous country into one of theworld's poorest nations and the one-party rule has curtailed manycivil liberties.   The stagnant economy has created widespread unemployment orunder-employment among university graduates, who spearheaded theweek's anti-government drive.   The 78-year-old Ne Win came to power in a 1962 coup and hassince ousted a number of potential rivals. But until last year,overt, mass opposition had been sporadic with the last majorprotests prior to October occuring in 1974.   The government has said that the curfew as well as a ban onpublic meetings and demonstrations would last until Aug. 19. It hasnot said when classes would be resumed.</TEXT></DOC>
