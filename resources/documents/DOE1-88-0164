This definition forms thebasis of a theory of quantum jumps which leads to a number of testablepredictions. Experiments are proposed to test the theory. The suggestedexperiments also test the quantum Zeno paradox, i.e., they test the propositionthat frequent observation of a quantum system inhibits quantum jumpsin that system.</TEXT></DOC>
