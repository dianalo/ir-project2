(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man has dropped a lawsuit seeking to keephis ex-girlfriend from getting an abortion after learning that shewas not pregnant, his lawyer said.   Elton K. Johnson of Columbia on Wednesday dropped his suitagainst a woman publicly known as ``Jane Doe'' after learningthrough a variety of sources, though not from a medical examination,that she was not pregnant, said his attorney, Richard G. Whiting.   The 23-year-old woman has refused to take a pregnancy test andstill will not say if she was pregnant, said the woman's attorney,Victoria Eslinger.   ``That is none of their business,'' she said, referring toJohnson and his attorney.   Eslinger said Johnson knew no more about her client's conditionWednesday than when he undertook his court fight last week.   ``We take the position that that is a victory,'' Ms. Eslingersaid.   Once the suit was withdrawn, a temporary restraining orderpreventing the woman from seeking an abortion became invalid.   ``She was extremely relieved,'' Ms. Eslinger said. ``She plans toresume her life.''   Ms. Eslinger said a three-month relationship between her clientand Johnson ended about a month ago but Johnson, 34, wanted thewoman to carry the fetus to term, if indeed she was pregnant.   Ms. Eslinger said she sees the suit's withdrawal as bothvindication of her belief that the Family Court did not havejurisdiction, and affirmation of a woman's right to independentlyterminate a pregnancy within the first three months.   Steven Bates, executive director of the state chapter of theAmerican Civil Liberties Union, said the lawsuit appeared to be partof an effort by anti-abortion activists to alter current law.   ``This is guerrilla warfare by the right-to-lifers,'' Bates said.``There is no legal basis for bringing these actions.''   But Whiting said he felt Johnson's motives were sincere and inthe interests of the unborn child.   ``This case was not brought for publicity reasons,'' Whiting said.</TEXT></DOC>
