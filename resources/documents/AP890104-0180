In the Southwest, rain fell from southern California into westernNew Mexico, with snow piling up in the Arizona mountains. Flagstaffreceived 5 inches of new snow for a total of 10 inches on the ground.   There was heavy rain and scattered thunderstorms elsewhere inArizona, with over a half inch of rain recorded Wednesday morning atKingman and Yuma.   Southern California's deserts and valley also got a soaking, withmore than three-quarters of an inch of rain reported at Blythe andNeedles.   Freezing rain iced roads around Cedar City, in southwest Utah,making travel hazardous. Snow was heavy at times over parts ofsouthern Utah, where 2 to 4 inches were expected.   The eastern Great Lakes and Appalachian region got its own shareof snow, with up to 8 inches reported in the southeastern Clevelandsuburbs of Bedford and Garfield Heights and 4 to 8 inches elsewherein the area.   Snow also piled up in West Virginia. Up to 7 inches fell acrossmuch of the state, with up to a foot reported in parts of thenorthern mountains. Snowfall across the mountains of Pennsylvaniaranged from 5 to 7 inches.   Temperatures across northern and central New England were between10 above and 10 below zero at midday and northwest winds ranged from10 to 30 mph, putting wind chill temperatures between 30 below and50 degrees below zero.   It was much better elsewhere in the Northeast. At NewarkInternational Airport in New Jersey, meteorologist Walter Zamorskiof the National Weather Service said the high for the day was 29degrees at 1 a.m.   ``It got colder as the sun came up,'' he said, chuckling. ``Itdropped into the teens by the afternoon, and with the wind chill, itprobably brings it close to minus 40 below.''   In New York, the wind chill factor prompted the National WeatherService to issue frostbite warnings for people venturing outdoorswithout bundling up. In Syracuse, officials closed schools due tothe cold.   By contrast, the southern half of the Plains enjoyed temperaturesinto the 50s. To the north, after many days of sub-zero readings,Devils Lake, N.D., hit 36 degrees Wednesday afternoon, tying the1984 record high for the date.

Numerous showers and thunderstorms were forecast fromsoutheast Kansas and central Oklahoma into Arkansas and the lowerMississippi Valley. In the upper Midwest, freezing rain was expectedfrom southeastern Minnesota and central Wisconsin into southeastlower Michigan and northeastern Ohio, with scattered snow fromnortheastern Minnesota into central lower Michigan.   In the West, numerous showers were forecast along the northernPacific coast with scattered rainfall farther south. Snowshowerswill be scattered from the northern Rockies into Nevada, with morefrequent snow from northern Montana into central Idaho.   High temperatures again will be in the single digits and teensacross northern and central New England, and in the 20s from thenorthern Rockies through northern North Dakota and the northernGreat Lakes into southern New England.   From the California coast across the southern Plains into theTennessee Valley and the south Atlantic coast, highs were forecastin the 50s and 60s, but rising into the 70s across the western andcentral Gulf coast. The nation's southernmost reaches, south Floridaand the tip of Texas, will have temperatures in the 80s. Highs willbe in the 30s or 40s across the remainder of the nation.</TEXT></DOC>
