The corporate secrecy issue caused fiery debate at theU.N.-sponsored meeting reviewing the 1987 Montreal Protocol.   The Montreal agreement, ratified by 36 countries, pledgesdrastic cuts in the production and use of chlorofluorocarbons, orCFCs, which are blamed for breaking down the ozone layer.   The secrecy resolution, put forward by the United States and the12 nations of the European Economic Community, won unanimousapproval, delegates said.   Greenpeace delegate Karen Coulter said the environmental groupfeared that greater secrecy could help countries hide theproduction of banned chemicals. Under the Montreal Protocol, thesignatory nations must report to the U.N. Environmental Program onthe production, consumption and trade in five chlorofluorocarbonsand three halon gases.   Greenpeace wanted public disclosure of these reports.   But industrial countries were insisting on more discretion indeciding what figures should be made public, Ms. Coulter said. SomeWestern countries said full disclosure, which could give onecompany information about another's production, could be againstthe law.   ``Canada, like the United States, has national legislationprotecting commercial confidentiality. If the companies give usdata, we can't release it,'' said A. Chisholm, head of Canada'sAtmospheric Research Directorate.   ``We asked the meeting, `How is it that commercialconfidentiality can override environmental concern?''' said Ms.Coulter.   Delegates from 86 countries and nearly 100 non-governmentalorganizations are attending the conference, which is to update the1987 document requiring signatories to halve by 1999 theirproduction of five chlorofluorocarbons and three halons. Thechemicals break down the earth's protective ozone shield,increasing the risk of skin cancers and eye disease.   It was the second contentious issue reported from theclosed-door meeting. On Wednesday, the countries split over how tohelp Third World countries pay for technology to replace theequipment that emits harmful chemicals.   The United States, Canada, Britain, Japan and other nations thatwould be the largest donors opposed a recommendation to set up aspecial fund.   U.S. delegate Stephen Seidel of the Environment ProtectionAgency said the fund could cost so much in administration that itwould siphon off money better spent in bilateral aid projects. Adraft resolution was submitted today that would delay the questionat least until next year.</TEXT></DOC>
