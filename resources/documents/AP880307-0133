Vice President Bush said a sweep of the 17 GOP primaries was``too much for anyone to expect.'' But he was leading polls invirtually every Super Tuesday state except Missouri, where Sen. BobDole of Kansas had a narrow edge.   Even Dole conceded in Oklahoma City ``it's fair to say GeorgeBush has a good margin,'' but said the race is tight in Oklahoma,Missouri and North Carolina.   Earlier, the Kansas senator said in Birmingham, Ala., ``Myphilosophy in the South ought to sell like hotcakes, but so far itisn't happening. Bush is getting a lot of ruboff from RonaldReagan.''   Dole claimed polls show ``that I beat all the Democrats. (Bush)doesn't beat any of them .... We ought to nominate a winner insteadof a loser.''   Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, hoping to emerge from theSuper Tuesday contests in his home state and 20 others with adelegate lead, campaigned at a retirees' condominium development inNorth Miami Beach and picked up the backing of Annie Ackerman, 74,a onetime Chicago ward organizer now known for her prowess inturning retirees out to vote. She called him ``a person ofintegrity who gets things done'' and ``a mensch,'' using theYiddish word for good man.   Asked if Super Tuesday was a flop in bringing moderate andconservative Democrats back to the party's fold, the governorreplied, ``It's not been a flop for Mike Dukakis.''   Four of his rivals _ Jesse Jackson, Richard Gephardt, AlbertGore Jr. and Gary Hart _ were in Texas Monday.   Jackson, hoping the allegiance of black voters throughout theSouth will give him his finest hour in two runs for the presidency,visited an AIDS clinic in Dallas and journeyed to Brownsville,Texas, where he pledged to fight efforts to make English theofficial language of the United States.   ``We are a great nation. We can speak more than one language,''said Jackson.   Gephardt, the Missouri congressman who has staked his campaignon a tough stance against countries with unfair trade practices,made a pitch in Dallas for an oil import fee and campaigned in SanAntonio in front of a landmark.   ``We're standing today in front of the Alamo, a place wherethere was a fight for independence,'' Gephardt said. ``Thiselection in 1988 is a fight again for the independence of America,the fight for us to regain control of our economic destiny.''   In Dallas, outside a plant that has cut its production of oilfield equipment nearly in half, Gephardt said, ``Anyone like AlGore or Michael Dukakis who tells you that they're for makingAmerica energy-independent without being for an oil import fee issimply trying to deceive you in a shameful way.''   ``Something's happening out there,'' Gore said, insisting theundecided vote was breaking his way. He said the Democrats wouldhave a two-man race after Tuesday, and he would be one of the two.   Gore got a boost from Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, who left wordafter he departed on a trip to the Soviet Union that he had cast anabsentee ballot for the Tennessee senator.   Pat Robertson raised again his claim that there are Sovietmissiles in Cuba, telling a satellite radio audience in 18 states,``I don't think the missiles ever got taken out in '62. And I amsomewhat convinced that more missiles have been introduced.''   A federal judge in Washington dismissed Robertson's $35 millionlibel suit against former Rep. Pete McCloskey, who questioned hisKorean war record. The judge said McCloskey was the prevailingparty in the acrimonious lawsuit. Robertson agreed to pay courtcosts but not McCloskey's legal fees.   Super Tuesday, the biggest primary day in history, saw GOPvoters go the primary polls in 17 states and Democrats choosecandidates in 20 states. There are 712 Republican and 1,307Democratic delegates at stake.   Dukakis was hoping for a strong harvest of delegates from Texas,Florida and Maryland, as well as Massachusetts, Rhode Island andWashington state.   Bush, talking with reporters on Air Force II en route toColumbia, Mo., was asked about the possibility of a sweep. ``Youalways wish for that, but I certainly would never predict that.It's took much for anyone to expect,'' he replied.   Bush, who clobbered Dole, Robertson and Jack Kemp in SouthCarolina's primary on Saturday, admitted he was tired.   ``It's been a difficult effort leading up to Super Tuesday,'' hesaid, adding that on Tuesday itself ``we've got a pretty relaxingday _ except for the tension factor.''</TEXT></DOC>
