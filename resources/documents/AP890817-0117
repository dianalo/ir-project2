(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Newark housing authorities today agreed toscale back drastically the amount of public housing to be demolishedunder a slum clearance plan and committed themselves to replacingthe razed apartments.   The agreement beween the Newark Housing Authority and housingactivists was announced by U.S. District Judge Dickinson R.Debevoise.   The agreement provides for the demolition of eight apartmentbuildings containing about 1,900 units. To make up for those lostapartments, 1,500 new apartments will be built and hundreds ofothers will be renovated.   In addition, tenants in buildings being demolished will be givena place immediately in a new building or a renovated apartment.   Previously, the housing authority planned to raze 39 buildingswith about 5,700 units in the biggest demolition of public housingby an American city. The program is aimed at getting rid of whatcritics call ``high-rise slums.''   But opponents of the plan wanted assurances that the demolishedapartments would be replaced.   Debevoise said that without the settlement, the city would havelost about $100 million in federal funds previously approved forreplacement housing.   ``In this case, there is no loser,'' the judge said.   Many cities have destroyed or plan to demolish some of theiraging high-rise public projects, saying they are unmanageable anddangerous and should be replaced by townhouses and low-risebuildings.   Harris David, an attorney for tenants in a lawsuit against theNewark plan, said, ``My clients are extremely pleased. They considerit a substantial victory for poor people and the cause of low-incomehousing in the city.''   The Newark authority, the nation's eighth-largest, controls13,000 apartments and has a waiting list of 10,000 families. Nearly40 percent of the apartments are vacant, many awaiting demolition.More than 800 units have already been razed.   One-third of the city's more than 300,000 residents receivepublic assistance.   Daniel Blue Jr., executive director of the housing authority,said the first demolition probably won't begin until 1990.</TEXT></DOC>
