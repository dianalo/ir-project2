The six-point proposal, approved in a one-day session called byPresident Mengistu Haile Mariam, seeks to end a 28-year conflict inEthiopia's northernmost province that is the longest civil war onthe continent.   Public talks with an observer agreed upon by both sides is adeparture from previous plans. The government and rebels have metsecretly in the past with no apparent progress.   It appeared unlikely that latest proposal would find favor withEritrean rebels, who control about three-fourths of the province.   Shewan-Dagne Belete, chairman of a legislative committee thatdrafted the plan, said it was based on ``the unity and territorialintegrity of the country.''   That was emphasized in the preamble, which described theconflict as a ``challenge to the Ethiopian entity and the singleEthiopian identity.''   There was no immediate response from the Eritrean People'sLiberation Front, which is fighting for the independence of the RedSea province that provides Ethiopia's only sea outlet.   The government has offered limited autonomy but demands thatEritrea remain part of Ethiopia.   Mengistu called the special session less than than three weeksafter his government crushed a coup attempt. Among the coup leaderswas the commander of the 2nd Revolutionary Army, which has bornethe brunt of fighting in Eritrea.   He was was among about a dozen generals slain in the coupattempt, which Mengistu followed with a thorough shake-up of thehigh command.   In 1988 and early this year, the army suffered humiliatingdefeats in Eritrea and in neighboring Tigre province, which has itsown rebel movement.   One Western diplomat said privately, ``The generals have losttheir stomach for the war.'' Mengistu is under both internal andexternal pressure to end it.   The Soviet Union has urged Mengistu to seek peace, threateningto cut off military supplies when the current aid pact expires nextyear. Moscow provided an estimated $5 billion in the past decade,most of it in military assistance.   Shewan-Dagne told the legislature the government had held ninesecret meetings with the rebels. He did not say when or where themeetings took place or whether they were fruitful.   He also confirmed a meeting was held recently in Khartoum,Sudan, with the Eritrean Liberation Front, the first movement totake up arms in 1962. It has been pushed out of most of the regionby the larger People's Liberation Front, which boycotted theKhartoum talks.   Neither Mengistu nor Shewan-Dagne mentioned the Tigre People'sLiberation Front. Rebels in Tigre say they want only greaterautonomy for the province, not independence.</TEXT></DOC>
