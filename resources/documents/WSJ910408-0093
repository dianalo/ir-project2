The drops in practically every rail commodity weresteepest in automobiles, usually considered among the mostlucrative shipments for railroads. Even coal traffic wasdown, particularly in the East where unusually mild weatherlast winter cut demand for utility power.</LP><TEXT>   Graeme Lidgerwood, an analyst at First Boston Co.,estimated that operating earnings for the group were downabout 18% in the quarter from a year earlier. &quot;Earnings willbe down for just about everyone,&quot; she said. &quot;Some will beawful, and some will be less awful.&quot;   Analysts expect lower earnings at Consolidated Rail Corp.,Burlington Northern Inc. and Norfolk Southern Corp. CSX Corp.estimated it had flat first-quarter net, excludingextraordinary items in the year-earlier period; improvedefficiency on its railroad and strong results at itsoceanship unit helped offset a 10% decline in CSX's railfreight traffic.   Only Union Pacific Corp. posted an increase in railtraffic in the quarter, with carloadings up about 6% throughmost of March. The railroad's coal shipments rose 15%,reflecting strong demand for low-sulfur Powder River Basincoal from utilities seeking to comply with more stringentairquality standards. Analysts said the company's freighttraffic also benefited from market share gains.   Union Pacific officials, however, expect first-quarter netincome to be about flat with net of $128 million, or $1.27 ashare, in the year-ago quarter. They said slumping gas pricesat Union Pacific's natural resources unit and lower freightvolumes at its trucking operation offset gains at the railunit.   But for most of the rail group weak freight traffic is theculprit. Rail carloadings at the major railroads dropped 5.5%during the 12-week period ending March 23, according to theAssociation of American Railroads. Carloadings in almostevery category were down, with motor vehicles declining18.2%, lumber 21.3%, grain 10.7%, metals 3.3%, coal 1.4% andchemicals less than 1%. Even intermodal, the normallyfast-growing transport of truck trailers and ocean containerson rail flatcars, was off 0.8%. The only major commodity toshow an increase was paper, which posted a gain of 0.5%.   &quot;They are all surprised by the depth of the trafficdecline,&quot; said Michael Lloyd, an analyst at Salomon BrothersInc.   Mr. Lloyd expects the traffic declines to begin easingthis quarter. &quot;Inventory levels appear to be pretty tight,consumer confidence is rising and the economy may start tobottom out,&quot; he said.   The second quarter, though, is clouded by prospects thatrail unions will go on strike after 12:01 a.m. EDT April 17when a cooling-off period expires. Analysts speculate that ifa work stoppage occurs, it probably won't be long beforeCongress calls strikers back to work. Mr. Lloyd said thateven if railroads are able to operate half their service withsupervisors, a strike would cost the industry between $35million and $40 million a day in lost revenue.   Analysts also said railroads have been vigorously paringexpenses and boosting efficiency, and such measures havecushioned the blow from traffic declines. For example,Conrail, citing deeper-than-expected traffic declines, saidlast month that it is storing surplus locomotives, curtailingoperations at its major freight yards and reducing trainoperations.   Conrail declined to comment on analysts' estimates thatits first-quarter net fell to between 25 cents and 35 cents ashare from 43 cents in the year-earlier period. A Conrailspokesman said the railroad's freight levels declined about10% in the quarter and continued to be subject to a negativetraffic mix, with higher levels of low-revenue freight andlower levels of higher-revenue freight.   Burlington Northern said it isn't commenting on analysts'estimates, which ranged from a five cents a share loss to a15-cent-a-share profit in the first quarter. The estimatesinclude the effect of a $46 million pretax accrual forpotential labor settlements based on January's presidentialemergency board recommendations. In the year-ago firstquarter Burlington Northern had net income of $63 million, or82 cents a share, including an extraordinary credit of $8million from extinguishment of debt.   A Burlington Northern spokesman said carloadings were downabout 3% in the quarter, including sharp declines in grainshipments. But he said the company was helped by an easing ofdiesel fuel prices.   Norfolk Southern also declined to comment on analysts'projections that its firstquarter net income fell from net of$140.2 million, or 84 cents a share, in the yearearlierquarter. A spokesman said carloadings in the quarter weredown 6.5%, though export coal shipments increased.</TEXT></DOC>
