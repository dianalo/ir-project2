He pointed to the skeleton of a recently dead otter on thebeach, its bones picked clean.   ``Here's an example of why we have to get dead animals and birdsout of here,'' Lawn said. ``The eagles eat them. They ingest theoil in the fur, and they will eventually die, too.''   Acrid fumes from the black crude filled nostrils and wateredeyes as Lawn, district chief of the state Department ofEnvironmental Conservation, and his party of two jumped from ahelicopter. Oil, so black it seemed to suck light, smothered themossy rocks, an inch thick in places.   ``Welcome to refinery beach,'' said state official RichardFineberg.   The North Slope Crude, once bound for West coast refineries,went on for miles, up and down the east shoreline of this once lushand wild island. It's a tiny stretch of an estimated 800 miles ofshoreline hit with oil after the tanker hit a reef near Valdez tothe northeast.   ``Look there,'' said Lawn, pointing just off-shore at somethingsplashing feebly. ``That's an otter. He's just out there in blackoil. Oil's just black. That otter will die soon.''   Fineberg worried about the brown and black bears in thespruce-covered mountains rearing from the beach. How will they fishor find other food when they leave their winter dens?   They will die, Lawn said.   ``That spash. That's a seal,'' he said, pointing just offshoreat the velvety blanket of oil undulating on the water. ``That sealis going to die,'' Lawn said. ``That thing floating next to it isalready dead. It's probably an otter.''   Down the beach, Lawn spotted something else snorting and diving.``That sea lion is swimming in black oil. There's no clean waterout there for him to swim in. That sea lion, in a few days, will bedead,'' he said.   ``There's no clean water. Where's he going to go?''   Up ahead, gulls, some partly oiled, sat on tall black rocks.``They're trying to stay out of the water,'' Lawn said. They don'thave to dive for a living like some ducks and seabirds.   Lawn gets very mad when he thinks about people who fly over theisland and think the devastation is not severe because they can'tsee the dead, oil-covered animals.   ``The problem is you can't see them,'' Lawn said. ``They're sodamn black that unless they move you just can't see them. Youalmost step on them. They crawl into little crevasses to get awayfrom this terrible thing, whatever it is. They don't know what thisstuff is.''</TEXT></DOC>
