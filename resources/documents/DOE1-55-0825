Although cysteinesulfonate is knownto be decarboxylated to taurine by cysteinesulfinate decarboxylase, theoccurrence and importance of other metabolisms has not been examined.The present studies indicate that cysteinesulfonate partitions in vivobetween decarboxylation and transamination; the latter reaction is catalyzedby aspartate aminotransferase and yields beta-sulfopyruvate. Whereasbeta-sulfinylpyruvate, the product of cysteinesulfinate transamination,decomposes spontaneously, beta-sulfopyruvate is stable and is reducedby malate dehydrogenase to beta-sulfolactate. When L-[1-{sup 14}C]cysteinesulfonateis given to mice, 60-75% is decarboxylated to taurine and about 25% isexcreted in the urine as beta-sulfolactate. beta-Sulfo[1-{sup 14}C] pyruvateis found to partition about equally between beta-sulfolactate and cysteinesulfonateformation; greater than 90% of the latter is decarboxylated. Parenterallyadministered beta-sulfo[1-{sup 14}C]lactate is mostly excreted in theurine, but 12% is metabolized via beta-sulfopyruvate and cysteinesulfonateto {sup 14}CO{sub 2} and taurine. beta-Sulfopyruvate is not excreted,and only traces of sulfoacetate, perhaps formed by oxidative decarboxylation,are detected. These studies establish that cysteinesulfonate, beta-sulfopyruvate,and beta-sulfolactate are reversibly interconverted in vivo. Since onlycysteinesulfonate is directly metabolized to CO{sub 2}, the rate of {sup14}CO{sub 2} formation from L-[1-{sup 14}C]cysteinesulfonate is a validmeasure of total cysteinesulfinate decarboxylase activity in vivo; useof this assay permits inhibitor effects to be accurately determined inintact mice.</TEXT></DOC>
