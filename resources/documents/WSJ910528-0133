But reading any signs of future direction from the month'sfigures is difficult. Market perception of small stocks,whether they perform up to expectations, could sway shortinterest up or down. Small stocks &quot;will continue tooutperform the market in general,&quot; which they have done sincelast October, said Mary Farrell, an over-the-counter marketanalyst at PaineWebber Inc. But they will &quot;outperform at alesser rate.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   However, she said small stocks &quot;aren't overvalued,&quot; andhaven't recouped what they lost in underperformance in theprior five years.   Total short interest was down to 297.2 million shares,from 301.8 million in the month ended mid-April.   Short-sellers hope to profit by borrowing stock to sell,betting that the stock's price will decline and that they canbuy the shares back later at a lower price to return to thelender. Short interest is the number of shares that haven'tyet been purchased for return to lenders.   The National Association of Securities Dealers, theself-regulatory agency that operates the Nasdaq computerizedsystem on which more than 4,000 OTC issues trade, compilesshort-interest data in two categories: the approximatelytwo-thirds, and generally biggest, Nasdaq stocks that tradeon the National Market System; and the other, generallysmaller stocks that don't.   Although a substantial short position reflects heavyspeculation that a stock's price will decline, some investorsconsider an increase in short interest bullish because theborrowed shares eventually must be bought back.   Some short interest doesn't reflect any opinion on a stockat all but shows up as part of another strategy, such asarbitrage or dividend capture.   Among the largest and most frequently traded stocks --those on the National Market System of the OTC -- severalcable and telecommunications companies continued to have thehighest individual short positions. L.M. Ericsson TelephoneCo.'s short position nearly tripled to 4.6 million Americandepositary receipts; last month the Swedish company saidhigher expenses and economic uncertainties would make itdifficult to surpass 1990 results.   Tele-Communications Inc., with the highest short position-- 5.5 million of its Class A shares -- increased 27% fromthe month before. Traders previously have attributed the highlevel to arbitrage. Comcast Corp.'s short interest rose about10% to 3.7 million shares. McCaw Cellular Communications Inc.dropped about 5% to 3.1 million shares.   Eastco Industrial Safety Corp. saw short interest in itsshares surpass 1.3 million from only 30,244 the month before.Last month, the Huntington, N.Y., maker of protectiveclothing and equipment completed a rights offering for nearly5.8 million common shares.   Magna International Inc. short interest more thanquadrupled to 1.3 million of its Class A voting shares. Lastmonth, the Canadian auto parts maker said it would sell $75million of debentures. The increase in short interest couldreflect a &quot;hedge&quot; strategy in which traders short the stockand buy the bonds -- to be converted to stock at a latertime.   Hechinger Co.'s short interest in its Class A shares shotup to nearly 1.3 million from 281,600. The operator of homeimprovement stores, based in Landover, Md., reported a lossfor its fiscal fourth quarter ended in February.   Apple Computer Inc. saw short interest decline sharply to871,000 shares from more than three million in the priormonth. The Cupertino, Calif., company recently announced arestructuring to reduce operating expenses that includes a10% workforce reduction.   Intermec Corp. short interest also dropped, to 550,000from more than two million shares. Last month, LittonIndustries Inc. definitively agreed to buy the maker ofbar-code scanning equipment for $24 a share.   Xoma Corp. short interest dropped to 1.7 million sharesfrom nearly 2.9 million. The concern previously called forthe May 30 redemption of all its 9% convertible subordinateddebentures.   Sunrise Medical Inc. short interest evaporated to 5,000shares from 775,000. Last month the Torrance, Calif., makerof home health-care products reported a nearly 30% rise infiscal third-quarter earnings.   Among larger issues, short interest in 2,270 NationalMarket System stocks as of mid-May was 260,031,781 shares,compared with 264,103,002 shares in 2,279 issues for theperiod ended in mid-April.   Short interest in 1,189 smaller issues was 37,194,366shares for the period ended in mid-May, compared with37,738,402 in 1,235 issues a month earlier.   The National Market System's short-interest ratio inmid-May was down to 1.99 from 2.05 a month earlier, while theshort-interest ratio for other OTC issues fell to 0.78 from0.81.   The ratio -- the number of trading days at the market'saverage volume that would be required to convert the totalshort interest position -- is a measure of negative tradersentiment. Some analysts suggest, however, that the ratio hasweakened in value as an indicator because options and otherproducts can be used to hedge short positions.   The following tables show the over-the-counter issues inwhich a short interest position of at least 100,000 sharesexisted at mid-May or in which the short position had changedby at least 50,000 shares since mid-April.
