The freighter Nadezhda Obukhova was carrying polychlorinatedbiphenyls, or PCBs, from Montreal when it docked at Liverpool,northwest England. The cargo was to have been sent to a specialhigh-temperature incinerator in south Wales.   But the Mersey Docks and Harbor Co. refused to allow the PCBs tobe unloaded and said the ship will return to Canada after unloadingother cargo.   Earlier this month, the Tilbury Port Authority at the mouth ofthe River Thames refused to handle a separate consignment of PCBsfrom Canada, and another Soviet freighter had to take them back toMontreal.   PCBs were used primarily as a coolant in electrical transformers,but have been banned in North America because they have been linkedwith cancer.   Regarding the ship in Liverpool, a dock company spokesman said:``The ship will be discharging and unloading other cargo and sailingtonight.''   A dockers' spokesman, who also requested anonymity in keepingwith British custom, said: ``We did not know how serious it wasuntil it was brought to light recently and became a politicalfootball.''   The Liverpool port's refusal to handle the PCBs follows a wave ofprotests from residents of New Inn, Wales, where the RechemInternational Ltd. incinerator is located, and from the Greenpeaceenvironmental group.   About 100 protestors greeted the ship when it arrived at theRoyal Seaforth Container Terminal four hours later than scheduledbecause of bad weather in the Irish Sea.   The environment secretary, Chris Patten, said the Liverpooldockers had ``no reason whatsoever'' to fear the cargo onenvironmental grounds.   He said government regulations, tightened following a toxic wastecontroversy last year, ensured the Canadians PCBs were safe tohandle.   ``There is no reason whatsoever why on environmental groundsthese cargoes should not be handled,'' he said. ``After all, theport has been handling these cargoes safely for some time.''   Rechem has a contract to dispose of a total of 13 consignments ofwastes to be shipped from Canada in the coming weeks. Companyspokesman Allan Woods said its lawyers are studying the contract,although Rechem is not considering legal action ``at this stage.''Rechem, he said, will ``defend our position.''   Canada has only one incinerator capable of disposing of PCBs. Itis located in Alberta and does not accept wastes from otherprovinces.   Britain tightened its regulations for accepting chemical wasteslast year after a ship containing 2,000 tons of toxic waste,including PCBs, was banned from docking. The Karin B, a West Germanvessel, was carrying Italian wastes which had been illegally dumpedin Nigeria.   The wastes were ordered removed from the African country and wererejected by several European nations before being finally acceptedback by Italy.</TEXT></DOC>
