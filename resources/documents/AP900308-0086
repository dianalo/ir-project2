Jurors deliberated eight hours Wednesday before convictingEmmanuel Hammond shortly before midnight of murder, kidnapping andarmed robbery.   Hammond, 24, of Marietta hung his head and rubbed his eyes asthe verdict was read.   Fulton Superior Court Judge Ralph H. Hicks scheduled thesentencing portion of Hammond's trial to begin today.   Julie Love, a 27-year-old preschool fitness teacher whodisappeared in July 1988, was the subject of a much-publicizedsearch until her body was found in August. She had been shot in thehead.   Hammond was handcuffed in the courtroom and led away as MissLove's family embraced. Her father, Jerry Love, rfused to comment``until it's all over.''   Fulton County Assistant District Attorneys William L. HawthorneIII and Richard Hicks shook hands after the trial.   ``I am obviously very pleased,'' Hawthorne said.   ``I think the jury worked long and hard in their deliberations,and they apparently had some basis for their verdict,'' saiddefense attorney William A. Wehunt.   Wehunt contended Hammond's chief accusers _ his formergirlfriend, Janice Weldon, and his cousin, Maurice Porter _actually killed Miss Love and were trying to frame his client.   Porter has pleaded guilty to murder, armed robbery and rape inthe death of Miss Love and awaits sentencing. He testified lastweek that Hammond abducted Miss Love from an Atlanta street afterher car ran out of gas and that Hammond dragged her into somebushes and killed her.   Miss Weldon, who led police to Miss Love's body, also testifiedagainst Hammond.   Testimony in the trial began last week under heavy securitybecause of concern over the possible link to the pre-Christmas mailbombs. A death threat from a group called the Aryan ResistanceMovement, apparently unrelated to the bombings, later led to eventighter security.   A letter from a group claiming responsibility for the mail bombdeaths of Judge Robert Vance of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals and Savannah lawyer Robert Robinson said the attacks weremotivated by outrage over Miss Love's killing.   The letter, signed by Americans for a Competent Federal JudicialSystem, threatened more violence if any other white women wereattacked by black men in Alabama, Florida or Georgia. Miss Love waswhite. Hammond is black.</TEXT></DOC>
