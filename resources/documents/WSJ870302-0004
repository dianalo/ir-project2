The department said prices received by farmers were higher last month for cattle, hogs, oranges and sweet corn, compared with the previous month. But those increases were offset by lower prices for lettuce, feed corn, cotton and milk.    Cattle prices in February rose $2.30 for each 100 pounds to an average of $58.70 a hundredweight, while hog prices increased $1.70 to $48.90 a hundredweight. But milk prices fell 20 cents a hundredweight to $13.10, feed corn was off 11 cents to $1.36 a bushel, and lettuce plunged to $8.65 from $14.80 a hundredweight. </TEXT></DOC>
