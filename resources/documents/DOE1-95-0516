Many of the issues addressed in PRA work such as NUREG-1150 involvephenomena that have not been studied through experiment or observationto an extent that makes possible a definitive analysis. In many instances,the rarity or severity of the phenomena make resolution impossible atthis time. In these instances, the best available information resideswith experts who have studied the phenomena in question. This paper isabout a reasoned approach to the acquisition of expert opinion for usein PRA work and other public policy areas.</TEXT></DOC>
