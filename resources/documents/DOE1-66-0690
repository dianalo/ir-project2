Detente reinforcedthese beliefs, for a time, as the prospects of a conflict in centralEurope seemed more remote than ever. But the 1970s proved to be differentfrom the decade that many politicians and analysts in the Nordic areahad anticipated. Detente, as it became known in the early 1970s, provedto be of short duration. At the same time, the North Atlantic and northernEurope were clearly becoming increasingly important geostrategic areas-resultingmainly from the expansion of Soviet naval power initiated during the1960s. In the 1980s, politicians in the Nordic countries have becomeincreasingly aware of the new strategic realities of the region. Theyare forced to discuss how to change their policies to preserve the stabilityso cherished by them all. The debate is now beginning to produce results,making it possible for the Nordic nations to look with some confidenceat their capabilities of handling the threats of the 1990s. The Nordicregion will continue to be an area of increasing strategic importance,from the perspective of both the Soviet Union and the United States.With the Arctic acquiring new strategic importance and the developmentof new air-breathing strategic systems, the Nordic region will be thesubject of new strains as it tries to adapt to the changing strategicrealities. The tensions caused by the increased importance of the areawill thus put new demands on the security policies of all the countriesconcerned.</TEXT></DOC>
