Lawrence Smith is needling Latin American countries for not aiding U.S. efforts to stem the drug tide: &quot;You want to negotiate about trade? You want to talk about bilateral loans? The hell with you -- first, we talk about drugs.&quot;    The Florida Democrat is spearheading a House campaign to cut U.S. aid to Bolivia, Paraguay and Peru for not cooperating with U.S. drug-curbing efforts. Senators have picked a closer target: With GOP Sen. Alfonse D'Amato of New York calling Mexico &quot;America's No. 1 drug dealer,&quot; the Senate recently voted overwhelmingly to halve aid to Mexico and oppose its loan requests at international lending agencies.    Mexico-bashing is emerging as the core of a seemingly painless, politically popular way for Congress to deal with the nation's drug epidemic. Although Congress is angry with a number of Latin American nations, most attention is focused on the U.S.'s southern border. Mexico, whose economy is debt-ridden and ailing, floods the vast, nearby U.S. market -- which pays the best prices -- with nearly one-third of its imported heroin, cocaine and marijuana. Widespread petty corruption helps speed the deliveries.    U.S. policy makers and legislators lack a clear-cut plan for curbing the enormous domestic appetite for drugs. Their actions, charges Rep. George Crockett (D., Mich.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Western Hemisphere subcommittee, &quot;represent good politics but bad policy.&quot; Mexico-bashing -- like last year's Japan-bashing over the U.S. trade imbalance -- is a good way to pin U.S. problems on somebody else.    &quot;It is dumb. It is unwise. It is insensitive. But it makes us feel good,&quot; says Rep. Henry Hyde (R. Ill.), a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who opposes the attempts to cut aid.    But, like the euphoria from a drug high, what feels good inflicts damage on long-term U.S. interests, says a senior State Department official. Angered Mexicans, claiming their drug-fighting efforts are belittled by the U.S., threaten to become less cooperative. Some also are urging a tougher stance in negotiating repayment of debt to American banks. In Peru, which just agreed to a cooperative effort with the U.S. involving eradicating coca leaves, senior-level officials complain to their American counterparts that their efforts aren't appreciated, a State Department official says.    &quot;Cooperation has to be a two-way street. In order for it to be effective, it has to be done on the basis of dignity and mutual respect,&quot; complains Leonardo French, press minister at the Mexican Embassy here.    Congress's inconsistency irks Latin Americans. They complain that U.S. lawmakers rap Latin nations for dragging their heels on drug fighting but don't provide them with badly needed help to do the job. Congress slashed the administration's economic-aid request for Bolivia to $7.5 million from $30 million. Legislators also won't exempt these nations from a law barring U.S. arms sales to Latin American police forces. As a result, Bolivia chases drug-runners with World War I-vintage rifles that don't work, and Peru buys AK-47 rifles from North Korea, a State Department official says.    At the same time, a bill that would require export licenses for certain chemicals, such as ether and acetone, that are needed for cocaine production, languishes in a House subcommittee because of the opposition of U.S. chemical manufacturers.    Some analysts also say Congress is being propelled by a new political dynamic. &quot;The old political foreign-policy complex that included such things as being for a strong defense and standing up to the Russians is in the process of giving way to a new foreign-policy complex of issues: economic security, defense burden-sharing and fighting drugs,&quot; says Kevin Phillips, a GOP political theorist.    The latest round in the war on drugs began when Congress passed a law before the 1986 elections requiring the president to determine whether 24 nations identified by Congress as major drug producers or transit points are cooperating with U.S. drug-control efforts. Nations that aren't lose half their U.S. aid, with certain exceptions, and the U.S. is required to vote against their loan requests to international lending institutions.    On March 1, President Reagan certified that 17 of the 24 nations, including Mexico, Bolivia, Peru and the Bahamas, were cooperating; he invoked a national-interest exception for Laos, Lebanon and Paraguay, and said Afghanistan, Iran, Panama and Syria weren't cooperating. But the Senate imposed penalties on Mexico by a surprisingly lopsided 63-27 vote, and the House Foreign Affairs Committee approved Rep. Smith's bills.    Much of the action is an empty gesture. The House probably won't act on the Senate-passed bill, and the Senate isn't likely to move on the House measure before the mid-May deadline for countering the president's findings. Besides, the only U.S. assistance Mexico gets is for an anti-drug program that is exempt from the sanctions, and the other Latin American countries receive only a sliver of the U.S. aid pie.    Rep. Smith insists, however, that turning up the heat is working. Along with House leaders, he negotiated with Mexican Embassy officials for a letter outlining that nation's targets for anti-drug operations in exchange for dropping sanctions against Mexico.    But U.S.-Latin American relations, already strained by Reagan administration support for the Nicaraguan Contras and the inept operation to depose Panamanian strong man Gen. Manuel Noriega, are suffering further damage. With a presidential election campaign under way in Mexico, &quot;This dispute can only strengthen the hand of nationalists who argue that Mexico already is too cooperative with the U.S. in the ongoing battle over how much Mexico should give in the debt-repayment issue,&quot; warns Sally Shelton Colby, a Mexico specialist in the Carter administration who now is an international business consultant.    What most infuriates Latin Americans is that, in their view, the sanctimonious U.S. attitude about drug-fighting efforts isn't matched by actions at home. &quot;If the U.S. president would be required to certify local, state and federal efforts the way he's required to certify Mexico, those entities wouldn't be certified at all,&quot; says Samuel Del Villar, an adviser to Mexico's president.    ---                Estimated Marijuana Shipments                   From Mexico to the U.S.                                         PERCENT    PERCENT                              METRIC    OF TOTAL   OF TOTAL    YEAR                        TONS     IMPORTS     SUPPLY    1985                 3,000-4,000       40.0%      32.0%    1986                 3,000-4,000       37.0       30.0    1987                 3,100-4,200       37.1       27.9    Source: U.S. Government National Narcotics Intelligence Consumers Committee Report</TEXT></DOC>
