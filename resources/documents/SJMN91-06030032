Even the rise in military orders, they noted, was from aseverely depressed level the month before and was not large enough to provideany more than a nudge to business activity in coming months.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  DURABLE ORDERS ROSE IN DECEMBERCONSUMER CONFIDENCE PLUNGED IN JANUARY  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     In other economic reports Tuesday, the Labor Department said Americans'wages, salaries and other benefits rose 4.9 percent last year, lagging farbehind the 6.1 percent rate of inflation. The employment cost index isconsidered one of the best gauges of inflationary wage pressures.;    Anotherindex released Tuesday reflected consumer pessimism. Consumer confidenceplunged in January to its lowest level in 10 years, dragged down by failedattempts to resolve the gulf crisis, a widely watched survey showed Tuesday.;   The consumer confidence index of 54.0 in January, down from 61.3 inDecember, was only slightly above the figure recorded in the depths of the1980 recession, the board said.;    Overall this month, more than one-third ofsurvey respondents said they considered business conditions &quot;bad.&quot;;    ACommerce Department official said last month's orders for durables wereclearly higher than they would have been in the absence of the gulfconfrontation, but he could provide no breakdown, for example, of orders forships compared with those for tanks.;    Excluding military orders and thosefor commercial aircraft -- segments of the economy not closely linked to thebusiness cycle -- December durables orders fell 3.4 percent from Novemberlevels.;    Excluding only military goods, orders rose 1.9 percent, to $113.3billion, after tumbling 9.1 percent without military goods in November, thedepartment reported.;    Orders for durables are closely watched because theysignal future levels of economic activity. But analysts are careful to allowfor wild gyrations caused, in part, because durable goods tend to be costlyitems, such as airplanes, that are ordered sporadically and in largequantities.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mercury News Wire Services  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910130  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  363  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday January 30, 199100030032,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
