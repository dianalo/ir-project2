North to stand trial Sept. 20 and gave the firedWhite House aide access to a wide range of secret documents to showhe acted with higher authority.   The order by U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell means thatthe first criminal trial resulting from the Iran-Contra affair isscheduled to be under way when the fall presidential campaign is infull swing.   But Gesell's ruling on secret documents also pointedly raisedthe possibility that three major charges stemming from thediversion of U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebelswould not be part of the case when it goes to trial _ if ever.   Gesell's order said that the defense had shown during a closedhearing on Wednesday that highly sensitive passages of documentsthat government security experts want deleted from theprosecution's case ``tended to exonerate North of guilt on certaincharges.''   The documents and others are relevant to the major chargesagainst North, former national security adviser John M. Poindexterand arms dealers Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj. Gen.Richard V. Secord, the judge said.   Gesell directed independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh to produceany documents to support North's claims that money raised by Hakimand Secord from the arms deals was combined with government money``to plan and carry out various covert operations, includingactions directly or indirectly supporting the Contras.''   The judge ordered Walsh to turn over documents that corroborateNorth's claim that these activities ``were all approved at or nearCabinet level; their execution was closely monitored through theuse of a variety of intelligence methods and sources.''   The documents should include those that show ``funding of theactivity from any source'' and ``whether or not senior governmentofficials were aware of the activity,'' Gesell said.   Gesell said he was not ruling on the merits of North's defenseor the admissibility of any documents as evidence.   ``The jury must decide where the truth lies,'' Gesell said. Butthe judge said he was ordering the government to produce the highlysecret documents ``to assure that the truth, whatever it ultimatelyproves to be, `will out.'''   Under the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA), thegovernment could decide it does not want to prosecute North on themajor conspiracy charge because doing so would require disclosureof sensitive information that would jeopardize national security.   If the problems of disclosing secret government documents cannotbe resolved by September, Gesell said he will proceed to try Northon charges that don't require extensive use of classified material.   ``At a minimum, substantive charges of cover-up, falsificationand North's alleged receipt of personal benefit derived from hisconduct as a government employee can proceed to trial,'' Gesellsaid.   ``This trial date is six months after indictment. It must bemet.''   In a brief statement, Walsh said: ``We are ready to proceed asdirected by the court.''   The charge that North conspired with his three co-defendants todefraud the government by illegally diverting arms-sale proceedsrequires the most use of classified documents.   This charge, plus two others charging all four defendants withwire fraud and theft of government property, involve questions ofwhether the defendants intended to violate the law.   Among the secret materials sought by North, Gesell noted, ``aredocuments bearing primarily on issues of criminal intent, which isof particular significance to the first three counts of theindictment.''   ``They may also support defense challenges to the credibility ofcertain known prosecution witnesses who have, in the past, deniedthat North's funding and other activities were monitored, known andapproved at the highest levels of government.''   An expected defense to the three charges is that North and hisco-defendants acted with the implicit or explicit approval ofhigher officials in the Reagan administration. Gesell has orderedseparate trials for all four defendants.   North should be given documents containing any references tocovert aid to the Contras in President Reagan's daily intelligencebriefings between Sept. 1, 1984, and Dec. 31, 1986, or in thepresident's regular daily briefing by his staff, Gesell said.   Any other information about aid to the Contras that wasforwarded to the White House by the Central American JointIntelligence Task Force during this period should also be provided,the judge said.   The judge also ordered Walsh to specify by Aug. 1 the documentshe intends to produce as evidence against North on the other 13charges against the former White House aide.   These include charges that North lied to Congress about his rolein providing covert aid to the Contras and that he shreddeddocuments during Attorney General Edwin Meese III's November 1986investigation of the Iran-Contra affair.   He is also charged with accepting an illegal gratuity _ a$15,000 security fence installed around his suburban Virginia home.The indictment charges that Secord paid for the fence.   North is accused of obstructing an FBI investigation into thefence as well as pocketing $4,300 worth of travelers checks fromthe $90,000 he was given by Contra leaders to defray expenses ofhelping the rebels.   ``A jury trial on those counts remaining after the CIPA processtakes its course is set for Sept. 20,'' Gesell said.   The classified information law has provisions for substitutingsecret documents with statements of facts about what the materialwould prove or by redacting, or deleting, especially sensitiveportions of classified material.   Gesell noted that a government task force studying documentsWalsh intends to produce in his case against North ``remainsadamantly opposed to any public disclosure of the classifiedinformation redacted'' by prosecutors from the material.   This includes passages that ``tended to exonerate North of guilton certain charges,'' the judge said.   At Wednesday's hearing, which was not attended by prosecutors,North's lawyer ``also demonstrated how his theory of the defenserequires use of redacted portions of the government's case.''   The judge said he had concluded that the prosecution ``hasredacted certain information from its documentary case-in-chiefwhich must be available to North for his use in trial.''   The judge said North is entitled to obtain documents showing heparticipated under a pseudonym in covert activities and ``any useof contemplated use of the vessel Erria.''   The Danish freighter was used in clandestine arms shipments fromEurope to the Contras. In 1986 it carried arms to the Mediterraneanas part of an anticipated arms-for-hostage deal that never occurred.</TEXT></DOC>
