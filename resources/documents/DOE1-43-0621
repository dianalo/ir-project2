<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-43-0621 </DOCNO><TEXT>The structure of constraints is studied and a consequent derivation ofHamiltonians for the Nambu strings and the Schild null strings is carriedout in the frame of a new approach. Auxiliary fields are excluded fromthe actions and Hamiltonians by means of the solution of second-classconstraints. New effective actions and Hamiltonians which do not containauxiliary fields are derived. A null membrane with a linearized equationof motion is suggested. The null string concept is extended to null superstringsand null supermembranes. New invariant point-like formulations of actionsare introduced for null superstrings and null supermembranes. 11 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
