(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal law that stripped governors oftheir power to veto National Guard training missions dictated by thefederal government is unconstitutional, a federal appeals courtruled Tuesday.   However, another federal appeals court has ruled just theopposite and the two rulings presumably will have to be consideredby the Supreme Court.   A panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1Tuesday that the so-called Montgomery Amendment, taking away agovernor's control over National Guard units, is unconstitutional.   The amendment was challenged by Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich, whoobjected to the Defense Department ordering Minnesota Guard units toCentral America. Governors of other states also have objected andthe states of Massachusetts, Ohio, Colorado, Vermont and Mainesupported Minnesota's lawsuit.   However, the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Octoberrejected a similar challenge to the amendment filed by MassachusettsGov. Michael Dukakis.   Dukakis said in a statement: ``Today's ruling by the 8th U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals is a victory for common sense, theConstitution and the governors of the United States.''   Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon said the state wasnow more likely to appeal the 1st Circuit ruling.   `Today's ruling in the Minnesota case was what we argued here inBoston. So our position has been vindicated by one court ofappeals,'' said Shannon.   Justice Department official said Tuesday's ruling will apply onlyto states within the 8th Circuit. A Guard official in Washingtonsaid no decision had been made on whether to appeal.   The amendment was attached to the Defense Authorization Act of1987 by Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery, D-Miss. Prior to its passagein 1986, state units could not be sent on federal training missionswithout a governor's consent.   The 8th Circuit concluded that the Montgomery Amendmentcontravenes the intent of the framers of the U.S. Constitution, whothey said designed the militia _ or National Guard _ ``to serve as acheck on the potential abuse of military power by the federalgovernment.''   ``...The government has not demonstrated that the effectivenessof either the national defense or the National Guard will bediminished by adherence to the constitutional principle of basicstate control over National Guard forces, absent a declaration ofwar or national exigency,'' the 8th Circuit majority held.   The opinion was released in St. Paul and at the court'sheadquarters in St. Louis.   The amendment violates the plain language of the Constitution, isat odds with declarations of the U.S. Supreme Court and ``departsfrom an unbroken pattern of congressional deference to reservedstate authority'' over the National Guard which is embodied in themilitia clauses of the Constitution, the court said.   Perpich was vacationing in Hawaii, but his office issued astatement from him: ``From the beginning, this has been a state'srights issue. The Montgomery amendment went too far in tipping thebalance of power toward the federal government.''   At the Defense Department in Washington, National Guard Bureauspokesman Dan Donohue said the ruling suggests further legal actionis likely. ``But no decisions have been made officially on anappeal,'' he said.   Donohue said the ruling in the Minnesota case would have littleimmediate effect.   ``From our point of view, the training of the National Guardcontinues to be our primary responsibility. And the MontgomeryAmendment is still the law of the land except in the affected case(Minnesota). We will continue to deploy and train soldiers inaccordance with the federal law.''   Amy Brown, a spokeswoman for the Department of Justice inWashington, said the only states covered by the ruling are the sevenin the 8th Circuit _ Arkansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraskaand North and South Dakota. However, she said, the ruling does nottake effect immediately and if the federal government appeals itprobably would be put on hold.   About 115,000 men and women serve in the Air National Guard and460,000 in the Army National Guard, Donohue said.   The Pentagon is planning to send about 6,000 Guard members fromacross the country to Honduras in 1989 for road-building andengineering exercises, Donohue said. No such exercises are under waybecause of the rainy season in Central America, he added.   Capt. David Wirwahn, a spokesman for the Minnesota NationalGuard, said Minnesota Guard members are scheduled for missions inPanama from January through March. Perpich already has agreed tothose missions, he said.   Montgomery said in a statement that giving governors veto powerover Guard missions ``would raise questions about the availabilityof the Guard to meet its considerable defense responsibilities.''</TEXT></DOC>
