But Secretary of State George P. Shultz has denied reports thatWashington is negotiating with Iran to release hostages and saidthat ``anyone who tries to cut across our policies should buttout.''   Lebanese kidnappers warned on Thursday that two Americanhostages may be in danger if U.N. troops are sent to Lebanon tooversee presidential elections.   Sixteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are missing inLebanon. Most are believed held by Shiite Moslem extremists backedby Iran.   On Monday, the Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestinefreed Indian hostage Mithileshwar Singh after 20 months ofcaptivity. Singh, a professor of finance at Beirut UniversityCollege, is a legal resident of the United States.   In Jerusalem, the new English-language weekly The Nationreported today the United States struck a deal with Iran to freeU.S. hostages in Lebanon, including the supply of arms and spareparts to Tehran through South Korea.   The unattributed report said the U.S. government agreed to pay$7 million in ransom to the militants holding the hostages butrefused the group's demands for immunity from prosecution.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the report was ``nottrue.''   The report said the U.S. refusal to guarantee immunity angeredthe kidnappers and prompted them to release Singh instead of AlannSteen, a U.S. citizen whose release had been expected.   In addition to Steen, 49, of Boston, the group holds JesseTurner, 41, a native of Boise, Idaho; and Robert Polhill, 54, ofNew York City. All four taught at Beirut University College.   Shultz said at the United Nations on Thursday that anyone whoclaims to be a U.S. envoy to secret U.S-Iran negotiations is lying.   ``There is not going to be any deal,'' Shultz said. ``Thehostages should be released.''   Shultz responded to questions about statements in Paris byformer President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr of Iran. Bani-Sadr said anagent of Vice President George Bush, Richard Lawless, negotiatedSingh's release.   Two Beirut publications reported today that Anglican Churchenvoy Terry Waite, missing in Lebanon for more than 20 months, willbe freed in 72 hours.   One report was carried by the conservative daily Al-Anwar, basedin Christian east Beirut. It has no record of authoritative reportson the hostage issue, and there was no way to confirm the report.   Ash-Shiraa, based in Moslem west Beirut, said Waite and twoother British hostages will be released ``very soon.'' Bothpublications cited unidentified informed sources for their reports.   Ash-Shiraa gained international fame when it broke the story ofsecret U.S. arms sales to Iran in November, 1986. But its recentreports on the hostages have not been accurate.   Waite disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, after leaving his west Beiruthotel for a rendezvous with Islamic Jihad, or Holy War, which holdsAmerican hostages Terry Anderson, 40, and Thomas Sutherland, 56.   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The AssociatedPress, is the longest-held captive. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.   On Thursday, the Revolutionary Justice Organization, whichclaims to hold Joseph James Cicippio of Norristown, Pa. and EdwardAustin Tracy, of Burlington, Vt., said the hostages may be indanger if U.N. troops are sent to Lebanon.   ``We shall use all the cards to thwart these conspiracies,including the card of the safety of the hostages,'' said astatement typewritten in Arabic and delivered to the independentnewspaper An-Nahar.   In an accompanying photo, the 58-year-old Cicippio was sittingon a blanket-covered bed with his hands clasped in his lap, dressedin a navy blue track suit with red stripes. He was smiling as hefaced the camera, but looked considerably thinner than in previouspictures released by his captors.   Cicippio was acting comptroller at the American University ofBeirut when he was kidnapped on the school's campus on Sept. 12,1986. Tracy, 57, an author, was kidnapped Oct. 21, 1986 in Moslemwest Beirut.   France this week proposed dispatching a U.N. peacekeeping forceto Beirut to oversee election of a new president in Lebanon, aformer French colony.</TEXT></DOC>
