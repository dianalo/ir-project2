For solutions of the complexsalt with divalent anions such as sulfate, L-tartrate, and succinate,remarkable shifts to higher field were observed with increase in theconcentration, whereas only slight shifts were observed for the univalent-anionsalts such as perchlorate, chloride, and iodide, but not for the acetatewhich showed a considerable higher field shift. These concentration dependencesof the {sup 59}Co chemical shifts were well-explained by assuming ionassociation. The shift to higher field was attributed to the hydrogenbonding of the complex ion with anions and to the ob-to-lel conformationalchange of the ethylenediamine chelate rings accompanying ion-pair formation.The {sup 59}Co spin-lattice relaxation rate of the [Co(en){sub 3}]{sup3+} ion in aqueous solution also showed concentration dependences moreor less similar to those for the chemical shift; i.e., it considerablyincreased with increasing concentration for the divalent-anion saltsand acetate, whereas only slight increases were shown for the salts ofother univalent anions. These concentration dependences of the relaxationrates were also treated by assuming ion association. The electric fieldgradients at the {sup 59}Co nuclear site were estimated for the [Co(en){sub3}]{sup 3+} ion paired with various anions from the observed {sup 59}Corelaxation rates. An appreciable decrease in the electric field gradientalong the C{sub 3} axis of the [Co(en){sub 3}]{sup 3+} ion is shown forthe ion pair with the sulfate ion.</TEXT></DOC>
