(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Slumbering residents startled awake by twomassive sonic booms triggered by the landing space shuttle Columbiatelephoned authorities with jittery reports ranging fromearthquakes to burglars.   The shuttle landed at Edwards Air Force Base without a hitch at1:35 a.m. PST today after passing over the coast near here, joltingpeople awake with a pair of sonic booms that rattled windows.   ``We got quite a few calls,'' said Los Angeles County sheriff'sDeputy Sheila Smith. ``Some thought it was an earthquake, otherssaid someone was trying to break in or was on the roof.   ``One guy said he thought a car crashed into the house nextdoor,'' she said, adding that the Malibu station received about twodozen calls.   All the sleepy callers were asked if what they heard might havebeen a sonic boom. After being told about the shuttle landing, theyagreed it was the likely source, Ms. Smith said.   The 11-day shuttle mission was the longest ever for a spaceshuttle and Columbia, carrying a rescued satellite in its cargobay, returned to Earth heavier than any previous shuttle.</TEXT></DOC>
