Part 2 initially looks at the use potentialof a number of renewable energy sources in developing countries and discussesthe technology needed for their efficient decentralized utilization.The systems considered are designed to make use of solar energy directlyand indirectly: solar thermal conversion, photovoltaic conversion, windenergy, hydro-energy and especially bio-conversion. Applying a numberof criteria, the possible contribution of these conversion systems tomeeting the energy needs of the populations in developing countries isascertained. Proceeding from the analysis and recommendations in Parts1 and 2, Part 3 then looks at the technological state of the art in theutilization of bio-energy systems to meet the energy needs of end usersin developing countries. Finally, the individual systems are assessedin relation to the prevailing overall conditions in developing countriesand their economic viability compared to conventional energy systemsand/or sources determined.</TEXT></DOC>
