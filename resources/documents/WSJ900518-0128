Assets of 245 general-purpose funds fell $640.3 million to$131.53 billion; assets of 102 broker-dealer funds fell $1.41billion to $158.43 billion; and assets of 160 institutionalfunds rose $270.1 million to $91.75 billion.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Yields on money-market funds inched up, and the yielddifferential favoring money-market funds over alternativeinvestment vehicles available to individuals widened by afew&quot; hundredths of a percentage point, said Jacob Dreyer,vice president and chief economist for the institute. &quot;Andyet assets in individual accounts declined again asindividuals have drawn on their money-market-fund balances topay for stepped-up purchases of equities and equity-fundshares as well as for Treasury bills and notes bought at lastweek's auction.&quot;   The latest drop was the eighth-consecutive week of declinefor money-market-fund assets. The total drop for the eightweeks was about $10.5 billion, and &quot;I think there are acouple of pretty good reasons,&quot; Mr. Dreyer said. &quot;Untilrecently, you had a slight creep-up of{certificate-of-deposit} rates, which means individuals wereshifting money,&quot; he said.   During the eight-week period, &quot;institutional balancesbarely changed,&quot; he said. &quot;The whole bloody thing happened inbroker-dealer and general-purpose funds,&quot; which are geared toindividuals.   The second reason Mr. Dreyer cited was tax season, when&quot;people like me who owed money to the {Internal RevenueService} paid at the last moment.&quot; And third, &quot;in the pastcouple of weeks, we've had an excellent stock market, andpeople are dabbling&quot; in stocks and stock funds.   Mr. Dreyer said that in the first three weeks of January,assets rose a total $15.5 billion, &quot;so this is not the end ofthe world.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
