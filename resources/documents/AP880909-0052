(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL founder Jim Bakker said he willwithdraw his offer to buy the ministry's assets if he cannotconfirm funding from his backers today.   ``It's time to fish or cut bait,'' Bakker said Thursday aftermeeting with PTL Bankruptcy Trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton.   Benton said Bakker has offered no proof he has the money tocarry out his $172 million bid. The trustee also met Thursday withother potential buyers.   In addition, Benton asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynoldsto extend from Saturday until Monday the deadline to present abuyer, since Saturday is a weekend day. He said he expects to getthe extension.   ``They did not show us anything (any documents) today,'' Bentonsaid after meeting with Bakker and his lawyers at PTL's offices.   He said he would withhold judgment on whether he thinks Bakkerhad the money, and would give him until 5 p.m. today to come upwith $3 million to secure his offer and to show proof that thefunds exist for the overall loan.   Bakker, who resigned from PTL in March 1987 amid a sex-and-moneyscandal, said he still is dealing with the investors he hadpreviously identified as 28 Greek businessmen. But he said Thursdaythe investors are not necessarily from Greece and would identifythem only as Europeans.   ``Somebody invented this Greek tycoon _ one of our beloved mediapeople _ and I went along with it because they wanted it sobadly,'' Bakker said.   Bakker also said he is not concerned by reports that themiddleman he was using to talk to the investors has been convictedof fraud.   ``I'm very satisfied the money is not tainted,'' Bakker said.   Louis M. Pihakis, identified as representing Greek financiersbacking Bakker's effort to buy back PTL, served prison terms formail fraud and other crimes during the 1970s.   Pihakis has an unlisted telephone number and could not bereached Thursday for comment.   Bakker, who has been asking supporters for donations, said hehas more than $2 million now and ``it's still coming in.''   ``I have agreed if we don't have confirmation of funds withinthe next 24 hours ... we will withdraw our offer to purchaseHeritage USA and go back and regroup,'' Bakker said Thursday. ``Ifeel like we need to bring this drama, at least this part of it, toan end.''   Benton also met with a group of investors he described only asCanadian who are interested in bidding on PTL's Heritage USAChristian theme park, satellite television network and undevelopedproperty.   He said the prospective bidder was not Canadian real estateexecutive Peter Thomas, who had offered $113 million for theministry but withdrew Wednesday, saying he's ``just tired ofplaying around.''   Benton said Thomas is still ``waiting in the wings.''   Bakker left PTL in March 1987 amid revelations of extravagantspending and a sexual encounter with church secretary Jessica Hahn.The ministry filed for bankruptcy reorganization that June.</TEXT></DOC>
