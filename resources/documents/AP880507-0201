GRACZYK</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A 7-year-old boy who had been kept virtually aprisoner in a bathroom, possibly for several years, was beingtreated for malnutrition after he escaped through a window,authorities said.   The boy's parents were jailed on charges of injury to a child byomission after their arrest Thursday night in what police areterming one of the worst instances of child abuse they had seen.   Alexander Lizcano Jimenez, 38, and his wife, Charlotte AnneBishop, 42, appeared Friday before State District Judge PatriciaLykos, who increased the previous bond of $2,000 to $10,000 apieceand appointed attorneys for the couple.   The boy, Bannoy Jimenez, told authorities he escaped Wednesdayby climbing through the bathroom window of the family apartment,then wandered to a service station where the attendant fed him ahamburger and fries and called police, said police juvenile officerA.G. DeWoody.   ``What you have here is a boy who has been deprived of achildhood,'' DeWoody said. ``No television, no toys, no love.''   DeWoody said the boy resembled a child from a famine-strickencountry. He had shoulder-length hair and his stomach was bloatedfrom malnutrition, he said. DeWoody estimated he could have beenheld in the bathroom for as long as four years.   Bannoy was being treated for severe malnutrition at Ben TaubHospital. The couple's three other children _ a 10-year-old girland 9-year-old twins, a boy and a girl _ were placed in the custodyof county child welfare authorities. They showed no signs ofphysical abuse.   Authorities said the boy was fed a cold meal once a day andshared the bathroom with two dogs. Judy Hay, spokeswoman for HarrisCounty Child Protective Services, said the boy also was bruised andcomplained that his back and ribs hurt.   ``Caseworkers here were astounded,'' Ms. Hay said. ``He lookslike a very hungry 4-year-old. It's just unbelievable.''   For all the boy's problems, though, he was able to speak freely,Ms. Hay said.   ``He instantly had a great rapport with our caseworkers,'' shesaid. ``It's pretty bizarre _ definitely.''   Ms. Hay said the child's sisters and brother may have beenabused, although not physically. She described them as very upsetand refusing initially to talk with authorities.   Randy Holzapple, attorney for the father, said after the Fridaycourt appearance that he hadn't had much chance to talk to hisclient.   ``I know very little about them, even less about the case,'' hesaid. ``Why is one child singled out? That's what's reallyperplexing everybody. It really breaks your heart.''   DeWoody said although the boy is 7, he had no concept of timeand believed he was 3. At the hospital, he said, ``They gave himtoys and he didn't want to give them back.'' The boy also tried tohoard the food he was given, he said.   ``I don't know how much communication he had with his family,''the officer said. ``He heard voices through the door and possiblylearned some communication like that.''   Holzapple said a grand jury would consider the case to decide iffurther charges should be filed. Conviction on theinjury-to-a-child charge carries a maximum sentence of life or 99years in prison.</TEXT></DOC>
