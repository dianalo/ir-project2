SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Earthquake deaths last year nearly tripled theworld's annual average, largely as a result of the tragic Armeniantremor, the U.S. Geological Survey reported Monday.   The year's loss of life in earth tremors was the worst in morethan a decade and occurred despite a decline in the total number ofsignificant earthquales reported during the year, Survey officialsreported.   The exact number of deaths remains unknown, but is likely nearlytriple the average annual toll of about 10,000 fatalities worldwide.   A year earlier, in 1987, only 1,100 lives had been lost inearthquakes.   The 1988 toll is the most since 1976 when at least 250,000 peoplewere killed in an earthquake in China.   The Geological Survey said it is using a low estimate of 25,000deaths in the Dec. 7 tremor in Armenia. That figure is the Sovietgovernment estimate. Some other reports have been much higher.   The Armenian quake, with a magnitude of 6.8 on the Richter scale,also injured 13,000 people and left more than a half-millionhomeless.   The main shock was followed within minutes by a second tremor,measuring 5.8 on the Richter scale, which estimates the energyreleased by a tremor. A quake of 5.0 can cause considerable damage,and the strength rises by 10 times for each whole number on thescale.   Collapsing buildings were blamed for many of the deaths inArmenia as the quake rattled concrete structures until they fell tothe ground, according to subsequent analyses.   Another quake in the Soviet Union, claiming about 1,000 lives,later struck in Soviet central Asia. That tremor occurred inJanuary, however, and so does not count in the 1988 toll.   The second most deadly quake of 1988 came on Aug. 20, when about1,000 people died as a result of a tremor on the Nepal-India border.That quake measured 6.6 on the Richter scale. It destroyed thousandsof homes and injured many.   On Nov. 6, a quake measuring 7.3 on the scale claimed 730 livesand injured about 4,000 people on the border between Burma andChina, the Geological Survey reported.   And on the India-Burma border three deaths were reported in anAug. 6 quake that caused landslides.   The Survey said it recorded 61 significant quakes last year, 15fewer than the year before. A quake is considered significant if ithas a magnitude of 6.5 on the Richter scale. Tremors of lessermagnitude are included if they cause casualties or considerabledamage.   Three significant quakes were recorded in the United States lastyear including the strongest shock of the year. That tremor,measured at 7.6, occurred March 6 in the Gulf of Alaska and resultedin only minor damage.   The only U.S. earthquake death last year was a heart attackfollowing a quake measured at 4.8 in Whittier, Calif., in February.The other significant U.S. quake occurred Dec. 3 in Pasadena, Calif.It was measured at 4.6 on the scale but caused some injuries andproperty damage.   A quake centered in eastern Canada on Nov. 25 was felt widelyacross that country and in the northeastern United States as farsouth as Washington, the survey reported. It had a magnitude of 5.7.Quakes in the eastern part of North America tend to be felt overlarger areas than tremors of similar strength in the West.   Europe recorded three earthquake deaths last year when a tremorrated at 3.0 killed a group of miners in Czechoslovakia on Sept. 2.   In addition a tremor rated at 5.8 caused several injuries inAlbania on Jan. 9.   Injuries were also reported from two offshore quakes, one in theIonian Sea near Greece Oct. 16 and another near the Azores IslandsNov. 21.   In Africa, eight persons working in a gold mine in South Africadied Jan. 5 in an earthquake rated at 5.2.   And Japan, usually very seismically active, recorded only onesignificant quake last year, the Survey reported. That tremormeasured 5.4 and resulted in 10 injuries and minor damage in theTokyo area.</TEXT></DOC>
