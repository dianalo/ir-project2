 Each has some strengths and some weaknesses; each has strongchampions, and right now no one can say which will emerge victorious.andP;  Wehave not seen such a contest since MS-DOS and CP/M-86 slugged it out in theearly '80s.andM;Philosophic difference.andP;  In the broadest terms, Adobe has designed a smart,complex rasterizer to render fonts that contain relatively simple hints.andO;Apple, in contrast, has designed a simple rasterizer that is really aninterpreter for a font description language; its TrueType fonts are smallprograms written in that language, complete with subroutines, global andlocal data, flow-of-control statements and so forth.andM;This, in turn, has an interesting implication.andP;  Improvements in Type 1rendering will have to come from Adobe or a competing PostScript implementer,since the quality of the type depends directly on the rasterizer.andP;  Incontrast, improvements in TrueType can come from any font vendor cleverenough to think up a new wrinkle on the use of the language.andP;  It will beinteresting to see which proves the more fertile environment for fontinnovation: a centralized team of specialists or a loose network of separateentrepreneurs.andM;A corresponding implication is that a given TrueType font will render exactlythe same in every computing environment, because the quality depends mainlyon the font, not on the rasterizer.andP;  We can also envision different versionnumbers for fonts to indicate that they contain new and improved hints; therecould be a nice upgrade business for font makers.andP;  In contrast, a given Type1 font may work differently depending on whether it is run on a ATMrasterizer or a clone implementation.andP;  It will probably look better on newerversions of ATM, because we firmly expect that Adobe will continue upgradingits technology.andM;One of the big quetions is how hard it will be to turn out good quality fontsrapidly and automatically.andP;  We expect that (at least at first) there will bewide variations in the quality of TrueType fonts.andP;  Different font foundrieswill take different approaches to coding their fonts, and some may put moreeffort into it than others.andM;ATM advantages.andP;  Although the ATM rasterizer is complex and thus takes morememory for its code (roughly 100K in the Macintosh version of ATM), the fontsshould be more compact than equivalent TrueType fonts.andP;  It is difficult togeneralize about the size of TrueType fonts, since font makers have a greatdeal of latitude in how they use the font description language and how muchhinting they offer.andP;  Eliyezer Kohen, whose doctoral thesis at Switzerland'sETC was on the subject of font hinting systems, estimates that a TrueTypefont would be 30% larger than the same design in ATM format (assumingequivalent output quality).andM;But Adobe's biggest advantages are in the marketing arena.andP;  It claims aninstalled base of 23 million fonts.andP;  There are more than 600 fonts availablein Type 1 format, and by year end we expect to see more than 1,000 as theMonotype and Compugraphic libraries come online.andP;  The vast majority ofhigh-resolution imagesetters use Adobe controllers and fonts; it will be awhile before high-res TrueImage (Microsoft PostScript licensed by Apple)typesetters appear.andP;  IBM will use the Adobe technology across its entirecomputer and printer lineup, while initially TrueType will be restricted toPCs.andM;TrueType advantages.andP;  In principle, it should be possible to make betterfonts in TrueType than in Type 1 format, particulary for use onlow-resolution devices like computer screens.andP;  The reason for this is thatthe TrueType structure is much richer.andP;  It offers:andM;* Global controls for stem widths and serif shapes, in addition to localoverrides for specific characters;andM;* Optical scaling, an old typefounders' trick of decreasing stem weights andx-heights as the point size increases in order to counteract as subtleperceptual illusion;andM;* No requirement for &quot;regularized&quot; character outlines (as needed for Type 1fonts), since the TrueType hints can apply whatever coercion is needed to fitan outline to a pixel grid at a particular resolution;andM;* Font-metric information (character widths, kerning pairs, etc.) embeddedwithin the font, rather than in an auxiliary AFM file; andandM;* Contextual variation of letterforms.andP;  This would allow swash characters andligatures to be suppressed or enabled depending on the context in which eachcharacter finds itself: position on the line, surrounding characters, pointsize and so forth.andP;  It is even more important in non-Roman scripts such asArabic, where justification is done by modifying letterforms rather thansetting the word spacing.andM;What is not clear at this point is how much effort it will be to generatefont hint programs that take advantage of some of these possibilities.andM;For the immediate future, the most important TrueType advantage may turn outto be speed.andP;  TrueType uses quadratic curves (second-degree polynomials),which should be inherently faster to compute than Adobe's Bezier cubicsplines (third-degree polynomials).andP;  Microsoft gave a dramatic demonstrationof the difference by racing two identical Macintoshes side by side, one usingATM 1.2 and the other using a prerelease version of TrueType.andP;  TrueType isroughly 50% faster than ATM.andP;  However, Adobe says that ATM will besignificantly faster by the time TrueType is released.andM;Making TrueType fonts.andP;  But what does it take to prepare characters with fullTrueType hints?andP;  At this point, most font vendors regard the more exoticcapabilities of the Royal technology as futures.andP;  The immediate goal is tofind relatively automatic ways of generating TrueType fonts that producescreen and printer output as good as that provided by Adobe Type 1 fontsrunning in ATM.andM;&quot;Relatively automatic&quot; is the key phrase here.andP;  Font foundries will be ableto assemble large libraries of TrueType fonts in reasonably short order onlyif they are able to generate those fonts with a great deal of tedious handtuning.andM;So far, no font foundry has been able to produce ATM-quality Royal fontsautomatically.andP;  Bitstream demonstrated &quot;alpha&quot; versions of 60 faces, but itadmitted that they still need work.andP;  However, Bitstream believes it canimprove its conversion program to produce substantially better results.andP;  Inthe meantime, Adobe is working on further improvements to the quality ofoutput produced by the ATM rasterizer.andP;  In short, while Bitstream and otherfont foundries are working to meet the ATM standard, Adobe is working toraise the standard.andM;And the winner is .andP;  .  .  We have a very interesting race on our hands.andO;While Apple is finalizing the TrueType rasterizer, the font foundries arelearning how to make TrueType fonts.andP;  Meanwhile, Adobe is hard at workimproving both the speed and the quality of its rasterizer.andM;If the font foundries find the means to generate ATM-quality TrueType fontsautomatically (and many believe that they will), then the speed advantage ofRoyal (if it sill exists) and the promise of future advantages (such asnon-linear scaling) should tip the balance toward TrueType.andP;  If, however,Adobe continues to improve its technology rapidly enough to keep its lead, itshould maintain its market advantage.andP;  From the user's perspective, this isas it should be.andM;In any event, advances in TrueType quality are likely to come typeface bytypeface--a prospect that pleases companies in the business of sellingtypefaces.andP;  The 1996 models will almost certainly be more sophisticated thanthe 1990 models.andP;  Advances in rendering Adobe fonts will come from improvedrasterizers.andP;  A 1996-model rasterizer should make all Adobe fonts, ofwhatever vintage, look better.andP;  However, to the extent that rasterizers arestill builty into ROM, it may be difficult for users of older equipment tobenefit from improved rasterizers.andP;  Other liabilities include the fact thatnon-Adobe rasterizers may not do as good a job on Type 1 fonts as the Adobesoftware does.andP;  Microsoft will license the TrueType rasterizer toanyone--including Adobe.andP;  Adobe licenses its rasterizer on a more selectivebasis.andM;We have been given a clear choice in technologies.andP;  The competition should behealthy.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
