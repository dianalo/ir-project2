 Viruses are, after all,great press.andP;  When some unseen, malevolent, quasi-intelligent entity causes alot of destruction and digital gore, it's always fun to write about, and evenmore fun to read.andM;But now that the obligatory horror story is out of the way, we can get downto business and face the naked, not-so-thrilling truth: things don't worklike that.andM;Given enough computers and enough opportunities to spread, most viruses willmultiply geometrically.andP;  In theory, a single virus could spread to everypotential host computer on earth in a few months.andP;  However, real life doesn'twork like that.andM;The biggest threat to your data is you.andP;  You'll almost certainly damage yourown data before a virus has a chance.andP;  I can't count the number of people Iknow who have destroyed their data in one way or another.andP;  (To be honest, Ican't count the number of times I've destroyed my own data.)andM;People forget to save files.andP;  They format disks accidentally.andP;  They'll savetwo files with the same name.andP;  Once in a while, you'll even see a distraughtDOS user who has typed DEL *.* and wiped out all or part of a hard drive.andM;The second biggets threat to your data is physical circumstance.andP;  Powersurges, magnetic fields from telephones and photocopiers, defective disks,coffee spills, wind-borne grit and other accidents claim more data thanviruses.andM;However, viruses are a threat, and they can cause disaster.andP;  In the Macintoshand DOS worlds, roughly 300 different strains of viruses have beenidentified.andP;  Those 300 viruses from a significant body of malicious softwarethat definitely threatens your computer.andM;Some of these viruses are nearly harmless.andP;  For example, one type of virus,generally referred to as a &quot;bunny,&quot; has no mission in life except to make asmany copies of itself as it can.andP;  A couple of fairly cute viruses can makeyour Mac talk to you shenever you start an application.andM;Other viruses, however, are deadly.andP;  One type of &quot;fast strike&quot; virus willreproduce itself only four times before it tries to destroy your data.andP;  Sometypes of virus (properly referred to as &quot;worms&quot;) will work their way throughmemory or through a disk drive, scrambling and destroying your data as theygo.andM;If you talk to computer users in any downtown business district, you'll findenormous differences in the experiences people have with viruses.andP;  The key tocontrolling viruses is to notice that they spread sporadically and unevenly.andO;Some computers seem to have a new virus nearly every week, while others arenever infected.andM;This summer, I found one large business that averaged 10 virus infectionseach month.andP;  In spite of all of the elaborate anti-virus software thiscompany used, it couldn't keep up with its virus problem.andM;Across the street, another similar business didn't see a single virusinfection all summer, even though they don't really use any virus precautionsat all.andP;  Once you understand how and why this happens, you can implement afew simple precautions, and reduce the risk of viruses to nearly zero.andP;  Infact, you can stop virus cold if you know how.andM;Use the following suggestions your computer will be as safe as any system canbe.andM;Organize your system properly and back it up.andP;  Before you begin to worryabout an anti-virus campaign, organize your microcomputer properly.andP;  On theroot of your hard drive, create three directories (or folders, if you have aMac).andP;  Use one for your computer's operating system, one for yourapplications and the support files they require, and a third for your data.andO;Put as few files on the root of your hard drive as possible.andM;Keep the organization simple, uncluttered and clean.andP;  Why bother?andP;  First ofall, because most viruses will infect executable files.andP;  usually, a virusthat pays any attention to data files will only damage or scramble the data.andO;Copies of a viurs don't usually infect data fiels (a few Mac viruses breakthis rule).andP;  If you know where the executable files are on your computer, theviruses will be easier to find and remove.andP;  And, with some viruses, datafiles that are &quot;closer&quot; to infected executable files will be the firsttargets for corruption.andM;As a bonus, if you organize your hard drive in this way, backups will be asnap.andP;  You'll only have to make backups of your data, because all of thesoftware can be re-installed from the original disks if anything happens.andO;This will change your backup from a tedious process that might involve 30 or40 disks to a short job that might take less than 10 disks.andP;  On a DOS system,you should also make printouts of your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files.andO;They can be targets for some viruses, and you don't want to put them on yourregular baccup disks.andP;  Usually, these files are small enough to be retyped ifanything happens to your system.andM;If your computer runs a lot of software and you think you might have troublere-installing it all, make one backup of the entire system just to be safe.andO;After that, only back up the data.andM;Adopt anti-virus procedures.andP;  Once you have your system organized properly,you can follow these steps to protect it from viruses.andM;* Make sure the system is completely clean of viruses.andP;  Use the newest, mostpowerful anti-virus software you can find.andP;  An DOS systems, I'd recommend theshareware program SCAN67 (or any one of several good commercial anti-viruspackages).andP;  Watch out for SCAN65: it's a virus in disguise, not an anti-virusprogram.andM;If you aren't comfortable doing this, hire a consultant to do an initialvirus sweep for you.andM;* Install anti-virus software that always operates.andP;  Don't disable thissoftware or interfere with it whie it works.andP;  It will check your computer andany disks you put into it for known viruses.andM;U Update your anti-virus software as often as possible.andP;  Once you've decidedto use anti-virus software, the biggest mistake you can make is to fail toupdate it.andP;  Three-month-old software can't protect you from viruses that werewritten two months ago.andM;* Assume steps 1, 2, and 3 will fail to protect you.andP;  Anti-virus softwareusually looks for infected files.andP;  In other words, when the software tellsyou about a virus, you've already got a problem.andP;  Anti-virus software is notenough.andP;  Make backups as often as possible.andP;  Adopt user-hygienerecommendations.andM;* Avoid shareware or public domain software.andP;  After all, who knows what idiothas posted that neat-sounding thing called &quot;Font Finder&quot; on the bulletinboard?andP;  If you must use shareware check it out thoroughly as possible beforeyou use it.andP;  A few wise people insist on making backups of their systemsbefore they install new shareware.andM;* Don't downloads files from bulletin boards.andM;* Don't &quot;borrow&quot; software from other people.andP;  If their system is infected,yours will probably become infected too.andP;  And, after all, you don't want toviolate copyright laws ...andP;  so don't give poetic justice a chance to strike.andM;* Assume that shrink-wrapped software hasn't been checked properly by themanufacturer.andP;  That's right.andP;  You can't trust &quot;original&quot; disks either.andP;  I'veseen over a dozen cases where viruses have come &quot;from the factory.&quot;andP;  Use yourvirus-checking software on all new disks.andP;  Before you install new software,make backups.andM;* Don't trust power users.andP;  You know the type: they run around from office tooffice with a mitful of shareware and macros.andP;  If you turn your back, they'llinstall a &quot;program from home&quot; on your system.andP;  Very often, these charactershave systems that are just dripping in viruses.andM;* Don't trust auto-removal utilities that come with the anti-virus software.andO;ninety percent of the time, these utilities work just fine.andP;  But, once in awhile, this software will make a mistake.andP;  Hackers will change a familiarvirus to act in unpredictable ways that can fool auto-removal utilities.andO;I've seen the results of this type of mutation wipe a hard drive clean whenauto-removal software was used.andM;* Either ask a professional to remove it or erase all of the infectedsoftware an re-install it yourself.andM;* Check for that virus on every single floppy disk you're ever used in thesystem.andP;  Don't assume that a disk contains only data files the virus won'tinfect.andP;  You may have placed an executable file there and forgotten about it.andM;* If you do have a virus, immediately notify everyone to whom you may havegiven a diskette or downloaded files.andP;  This is particularly important if youhave recently placed a file on a bulletin board or network public area.andM;These steps won't guarantee a virus-clean life for your computers, butthey're a great start.andP;  Most people don't do anything nearly this ambitious.andO;Instead, they'll just install the odd piece of anti-virus software and trustthat they'll be protected.andP;  Don't forget: the most dangerous thing aroundyour data is you.andM;Kelly Graves is a freelance computer consultant and writer based in Alberta.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
