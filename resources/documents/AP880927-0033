The 15-year-old law, a world model for preserving plants,animals and fish from extinction, prohibits trade in endangered orthreatened species and requires the government to take affirmativesteps to save them and avoid actions that would hurt them.   In separate action Monday, the House sent the Senate a bill toreauthorize the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act and initiate aU.S. program to curb the mounting losses of dolphins to yellowfintuna fishermen in the Pacific.   The passage of the Endangered Species Act renewal capped fouryears of struggle by congressional environmentalists to strengthenthe basic law and raise the amount that can be spent on theprotection program.   The legislation, worked out by House and Senate negotiators,would authorize, subject to the appropriations process, thespending of $56 million next year, rising to $66 million in 1992.The current level is about $39 million.   The bill contains a new program that would provide money tostates that enter into cooperative agreements to assist inpreserving endangered or threatened species. States could share $15million next year, going up to $18 million in 1992.   The legislation also would authorize U.S. spending of $25million through 1993 in an effort to halt population declines amongAfrican elephants, whose numbers reportedly have dropped to 700,000from 1.5 million in 1979.   The Interior Department would be required to reviewelephant-conservation programs of Africa's ivory-producing nationsand bar imports of ivory from countries whose programs are deemedineffective to halt elephant poaching.   The bill would bar raw ivory imports from any nation without anative elephant population and would require U.S. ivory importersand exporters to obtain licenses from the department.   Curtis Bohlen, a vice president of the World WildlifeFederation, said the U.S. action should ``put teeth'' intointernational efforts to halt the illegal hunting of elephants.   ``It's not going to happen overnight, but it's a good stepforward,'' he said in a telephone interview.   A violation of the elephant protection provisions could bring amaximum civil penalty of $5,000 and a top criminal penalty of a$200,000 fine and a year in prison. Maximum fines for violating thebasic Endangered Species Act would also be boosted, from $20,000 to$50,000.   There currently are nearly 1,000 species on theendangered-threatened list, about 400 of them native to the UnitedStates.   The bill would require the Interior Department to step upefforts to monitor the condition of species proposed for additionto the list. Environmentalists say about 80 species have becomeextinct while awaiting formal protection.   The way for passage of the legislation was cleared after acompromise was reached over a Reagan administration plan to requireshrimp harvesters to use excluder devices to prevent sea turtlesfrom drowning in their nets.   The bill would delay mandatory use of the devices in offshorewaters until May 1, 1989 and in inshore waters until a year later.In the interim, the National Academy of Sciences would study theviability of sea turtle populations.   Under the marine mammal bill, the Commerce Department would beable to ban tuna imports from nations that fail to take steps toreduce the drowning deaths of dolphins in tuna nets to ratescomparable to the U.S. Pacific tuna fleet.   Dolphins are at risk because schools of yellowfin tuna arefrequently found swimming beneath dolphins in the eastern Pacific.Congressional committees have been told that 115,000 dolphins diedin foreign nets last year, compared to less than 14,000 in U.S.nets.   The bill also would require a study of the effects on dolphinsof so-called seal bombs used by commercial yellowfin tuna boats anda study of the high death rates of the Atlantic bottlenosed dolphinoff the East Coast in 1987 and 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
