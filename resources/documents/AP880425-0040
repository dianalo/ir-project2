The governing Democratic Justice Party is expected to win thelargest number of seats in Tuesday's National Assembly election,but it may have trouble retaining its majority. Government failureto keep control would be a major boost for the opposition.   Roh, who began a five-year term in February, says the governmentmust retain control of the assembly to keep its promises ofsweeping democratic, social and economic reform. He accused theopposition of dividing the nation and fomenting unrest.   ``I still believe that the history of hate and darkness cannever be resolved through revenge and that love and reconciliationare the only cures,'' Roh said during the campaign.   Surveys by leading South Korean newspapers indicate thegoverning party may fall short of its goal of winning 125 of the224 assembly seats to be decided by voting. The surveys indicate itwas assured of about 65 seats and was neck-and-neck in about 80other districts.   The assembly's remaining 75 seats will be divided on the basisof how many votes each party gets. The assembly's power wasincreased by a new constitution and the president can no longerdissolve it.   But the rival opposition parties have repeatedly failed to uniteagainst the government and they are seen as having little chance ofwinning. The rival parties depend largely on regional support.   Many opposition supporters are disillusioned by the disunity andsquabbling for power between main opposition leaders Kim Young-samand Kim Dae-jung. They drew a combined 55 percent in December'spresidential race, but their individual candidacies both trailedRoh's 36 percent plurality.   The two Kims symbolically resigned after the loss, but remain incontrol of their parties.   The opposition has tried to discredit Roh and his party with acorruption scandal involving former President Chun Doo-hwan.   Chun's younger brother, Chun Kyung-hwan, was charged on March 31with embezzling a fortune in cash, stocks and land while he headedthe semi-official Saemaul development program. A government probeuncovered extortion, influence peddling and theft.   Kim Young-sam's Reunification Democratic Party and KimDae-jung's Party for Peace and Democracy claim the government hasexposed only part of the corruption. Opposition leaders allege Rohand other top leaders helped cover up corruption when they servedunder the Chun administration.   Kim Young-sam told a rally, ``The DJP's call for overwhelmingsupport for what they describe as social stability is nothing but aclear-cut expression of its determination to prolong rule bymilitary officers tainted by political interests.''   The government has fought back by insisting the issue was raisedbecause of Roh's promise during the presidential campaign to exposecorruption under his predecessor.   South Korea has experienced significant political liberalizationsince last summer and most controls on political activity have beendismantled. Roh has promised full democracy as quickly as possible.   But Roh has not won broad public acceptance. Many Koreans aredistrustful of Roh as a former general who helped put Chun in powerwith military backing in 1980. Roh has attempted to cut his ties toChun and his authoritarian rule.   Chun, who hoped to retain some power, was forced to give up hisremaining posts as a result of the corruption affair and hishard-line loyalists in the party were purged.   Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets last June inmassive protests against the Chun government. Roh backed oppositiondemands for elections at the height of the violence.   Electioneering for the National Assembly has been restricted bylimits on the number of rallies and bans on most forms of streetcampaigning.   ``A uniquely lackluster atmosphere prevailed in stumpingrallies,'' The Korea Herald reported in an analysis.   Candidates from all the parties have wooed voters with cash,meals, day trips and other gifts that are a customary part ofelectioneering. Newspapers calcuate millions of dollars have beenspent.   Scattered violent clashes between rival supporters have marredsome rallies and the government warned it would not tolerateunrest. But the campaigning has been far less violent than in lastyear's presidential election.   ``The politicians should not disappoint the people of thisnation anymore,'' said political analyst Rhee Chong-ik.</TEXT></DOC>
