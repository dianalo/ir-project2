Robert Maxwell, the British publishing tycoon who controls British Printing, said he is seeking &quot;friendly&quot; links with Amsterdam-based Elsevier. He didn't commit himself to further share purchases or a takeover and declined to be specific about the cooperation. Elsevier said it has been exploring links with various other publishers, but nonetheless appeared to welcome Mr. Maxwell's interest.    Meanwhile, Wolters Samsom Groep N.V.'s acquisition of a fellow Dutch publisher, Kluwer N.V., is in jeopardy because some investors who committed themselves to tender their shares to Wolters apparently can't meet those commitments, Amsterdam stockbrokers said.    Wolters has commitments for only 50.91% of Kluwer, and still doesn't have all the actual shares in hand. Elsevier, which made a rival bid for Kluwer, has commitments for more than 48% of Kluwer and has been striving to increase its stake since its own bid closed Monday. The exact number of shares that are still on the market is unknown, but observers said that both Elsevier and Wolters were apparently promised shares that weren't available.    While Kluwer's shares have jumped because of the last-minute scramble for its shares, the shares of Elsevier also have soared in the past week on rumors of a takeover. British Printing didn't disclose the purchase price of its 4,465,000 shares, but based on yesterday's closing price of 64 guilders ($30.28) it is valued at 285.8 million guilders ($135.2 million).    The news of the Maxwell stake in Elsevier drove down the stocks of two U.S. publishers, Macmillan Inc. and McGraw-Hill Inc. In trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Macmillan shares fell $1, to $70, and McGraw Hill declined 62.5 cents, to $74.375. Stocks of both companies had advanced in recent weeks on the belief that Mr. Maxwell might try to buy one of them. A Maxwell acquisition of Elsevier would lessen the likelihood of his acquiring a U.S. publishing company, traders said. </TEXT></DOC>
