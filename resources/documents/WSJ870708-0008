Spreckels is a sugar beet processor in Pleasanton, Calif. The industrial products group includes Amstar's Duff-Norton industrial lifting operations in Charlotte, N.C.    Amstar agreed to sell the operations in a leveraged buyout to a new corporation organized by management of those business units and Prudential-Bache Interfunding Inc., a subsidiary of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., which has agreed to provide financing to complete the transaction.    In a leveraged buyout, a group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. The debt is ultimately paid through the acquired company's operations or through a sale of assets.    Amstar's best-known product is Domino sugar. Its other business units include Milwaukee Electric Tool Corp. and Amstar Electronics Group.    Amstar said that Spreckels and the industrial products operations contributed about 20% to revenue and operating profit for the nine months ended March 31. For that nine-month period, Amstar said its operating profit was $72.3 million on sales of $1.05 billion.    Amstar itself has undergone two leveraged buyouts in the past three years. Amstar was taken private in 1984 by a group led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, which formed Amstar Holdings Inc. to take it private. Kohlberg Kravis, in turn, sold Amstar Holdings to Amstar's management and Merrill Lynch Capital Partners, a unit of New York-based Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. last November.    Amstar said the cash from the proposed sale will be used to pay debt incurred by Amstar in the November transaction.    The proposed transaction is subject to a definitive agreement and approval by Amstar's directors. </TEXT></DOC>
