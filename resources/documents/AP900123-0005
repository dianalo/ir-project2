You won't find theanswer to that on the front page of newspapers,'' Chetwynd said.``You can't make a docudrama about how decent people are seduced bythis dark shadow. This is a cautionary tale.''   ``So Proudly We Hail,'' which CBS broadcasts tonight, tellsparallel stories of three young men and a college professor whoview the extremist group as the answer to their problems.   ``In 1923, Adolf Hitler staged the beer hall putsch in Munich,''Chetwynd said. ``He was sent to jail, where he wrote `Mein Kampf.'He had only a few followers, yet within six years the Nazis were amajor force in Germany. If you can do that with just a broken-downtelephone system, what can be accomplished in this day ofcomputers, television and fax machines? Imagine what asophisticated, technically aware group could do in this country.''   The two-hour movie stars David Soul as a charismatic whitesupremacist who heads a group called the Aryan Resurgence Movement.Edward Herrmann plays a professor who accepts Soul's offer topublish his theory on cultural differences to avoid a threatenedloss of tenure if he doesn't publish a scholarly work.   Chad Lowe, Billy Morrissette and Peter Dobson also star as threeyoung drifters recruited as skinheads by Raphael Sbarge.   ``There aren't enough evil people to accomplish the purposes ofthese leaders,'' said Chetwynd, who also served as the movie'sexecutive producer. ``They accomplish their goals by convincingordinary people that the cure for their problems is to get rid ofpeople who are not like them. They convince them that Jews,`coloreds' and homosexuals are behind their troubles.   ``This movie doesn't have a happy ending. It has what I think isa realistic ending. The movement isn't destroyed. You can't kill adragon with one blow.   ``This a story without the obvious victims. You tell it in acontext that separates them from their victims. The issues are notclear cut. It may take viewers a while to see what these people areup to. The neo-Nazis succeed by addressing issues that frightenother politicians. Theirs is the only voice being heard.''   Chetwynd said he's concerned that people accept the presentationof issues on television as truth.   ``We say up front that we made this story up,'' he said. ``It'sjust one view of what extremism is in this country. We didn'tresearch it to death. It doesn't stand for all extremism inAmerica.''   Chetwynd was born in England and raised in Canada. When just 16,he lied about his age and joined the Black Watch, the RoyalHighland Regiment of Canada. He later studied at Sir GeorgeWilliams University and McGill University Law School in Canada.   His skill as a champion debater took him to England, where hewas invited to complete law studies at Oxford's Trinity College. Hebegan writing stage plays while working for the distribution arm ofColumbia Pictures in London.   Chetwynd usually is associated with movies that have a point ofview. In 1988, he wrote ``To Heal a Nation,'' the story behind theVietnam War Memorial in Washington. Other movies include ``Evil inClear River,'' ``Children in the Crossfire'' and ``Miracle onIce.'' His feature films are ``The Apprenticeship of DuddyKravitz'' and ``Hanoi Hilton.''   He also is developing movies on what happens when cocaine andcrack infect a small, middle-class town and on the effect oftelevision on college sports, along with a theatrical film forWhoopi Goldberg called ``Mommy Never Told Me.''   Television gives him the latitude to deal with controversialissues, Chetwynd said.   ``It begins with the idea that television is an extraordinarymedium, and if by happenstance and good fortune I'm able to doquality work, that's a great gift,'' he said. ``I can't say Iwouldn't want to do something profitable, like a hit series, butI'm quite happy.''</TEXT><TEXT>   Elsewhere in television:   `PRISONER' RETURNS ...``The Prisoner,'' a cult favorite starringPatrick McGoohan as a former government agent being held in aKafkaesque community, will join ``CBS Late Night'' on Feb. 1.McGoohan played ``No. 6'' in the show, which ran in the summer of1968 and again the following year.
