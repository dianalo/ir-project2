IRS Commissioner Fred Goldberg issued a statement to theHouse Ways and Means Committee approving the direction in abill introduced by the tax-writing panel's chairman, Rep. DanRostenkowski (D., Ill.). The statement improves the chancesfor the measure's passage as early as next year.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The fact that the bill doesn't establish distinctionsamong classes of intangibles greatly promotes simplicity,&quot;Mr. Goldberg said in the statement. &quot;I cannot overemphasizethe importance of simplicity and unifromity in this area; itis easier to administer, to understand {and} to comply with.&quot;   Earlier, the Treasury had endorsed as a small exception tothe bill a writeoff period of five years for retail purchasesof such computer software as spreadsheets, databases andword-processing programs. Taxpayers seek the shortestpossible write-off period so they can take bigger and quickertax deductions.</TEXT></DOC>
