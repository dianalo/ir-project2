We, the heads of state or government of seven majorindustrial nations and the president of the commission of theEuropean Communities, have met in Toronto for the 14th annualEconomic Summit. We have drawn lessons from the past and lookedahead to the future.   2. Over the past 14 years, the world economy and economic policyhave undergone profound changes. In particular, theinformation-technology revolution and the globalization of marketshave increased economic interdependence, making it essential thatgovernments consider fully the international dimensions of theirdeliberations.   3. We observed a sharp contrast between the 1970s and the 1980s.The former was a decade of high and rising inflation, decliningproductivity growth, policies dominated by short-termconsiderations, and frequently inadequate international policycooperation.   In the 1980s inflation has been brought under control, layingthe basis for sustained strong growth and improved productivity.The result has been the longet period of economic growth inpost-war history. However, the 1980s have seen the emergence oflarge external imbalances in the major industrial economies,greater exchange rate volatility, and debt-servicing difficultiesin a number of developing countries.   Our response to these developments has been an increasedcommitment to international cooperation, resulting in theintensified process of policy coordination adopted at the 1986Tokyo summit and further strengthened at the Venice summit and inthe Group of Seven.   4. Summits have proven an effective form to address the issuesfacing the world economy, promote new ideas and develop a commonsense of purpose. Especially in the 1980s theyhave helped bringabout an increasing recognition that the eradication of inflationand of inflationary expectations is fundamental to sustained growthand job creation. That recognition has been underpinned by a shiftfrom short-term considerations to a medium-term framework for thedevelopment and implementation of economic policies, and acommitment to improve efficiency and adaptability through greaterreliance on competitive forces and structural reform. Over thisperiod we have also singled out for concerted attention a number ofother issues of decisive importance:   _The overriding need to resist protectionism and strengthen theopen, multilateral trading system.   _To maintain and strengthen an effective strategy to address thechallenge of development and alleviate the burden of debt.   _And to deal with the serious nature of the world agriculturalproblem.   5. Since we last met, our economies have kept up the momenum ofgrowth. Employment has continued to expand generally, inflation hasbeen restrained and progess has been made toward the correction ofmajor external imbalances. These encouraging developments are causefor optimism, but not for complacency. To sustain non-inflationarygrowth will require a commitment to enhanced cooperation. This isthe key to credibility and confidence.</TEXT><TEXT/><HEAD>International Economic Policy Cooperation</HEAD><HEAD>Macroeconomic Policies and Exchange Rates</HEAD><TEXT>      6. The Tokyo and Venice summits have developed and strengthenedthe process of coordination of our economic policies. Developmentsin the wake of the financial strains last October demonstrate theeffectiveness and resilience of the arrangements that have emerged.The policy, the short-term prospects, and the medium-termobjectives and projections of our economies are being discussedregularly in the Group of Seven. The policies and performance areassessed on the basis of economic indicators.   We welcome the progress made in refining the analytical use ofindicators, as well as the addition to the existing indicators of acommodity-price indicator. The progress in coordination iscontributing to the process of further improving the functioning ofthe international monetary system.   7. Fiscal, monetary and structural policies have been undertakento foster the adjustment to more sustainable economic and financialpositions in the context of non-inflationary growth. Efforts inthose directons, including continued reduction of budgetarydeficits, will continue. We need to maintain vigilance against anyresurgence of inflation.   We reaffirm our determination to follow and, wherever feasible,strengthen our agreed strategy of coordinated efforts to reduce thegrowth of spending in countries with large external deficits and tosustain the momentum of domestic demand in those with largeexternal surpluses. The reduction of large external imbalances,however, will require not only our cooperative efforts, but alsothose of smaller economies, including newly industrializingeconomies, with large external surpluses.   8. The exchange rate changes in the past three years, especiallythe depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen andthe major European currencies, have played a major role in theadjustment of real trade balances. We endorse the Group of Seven'sconclusion that either excessive fluctuation of exchange rates, afurther decline of the dollar, or a rise in the dollar to an extentthat becomes destabilizing to the adjustment process, could becounterproductive by damaging growth prospects in the worldeconomy.</TEXT><TEXT/><HEAD>Structural Reforms</HEAD><TEXT>      9. International cooperation involves more than coordination ofmacroeconomic policies. Structural reforms complement macroeconomicpolicies, enhance their effectiveness, and provide the basis formore robust growth. We shall collectively review our progress onstructural reforms and shall strive to integrate structuralpolicies into our economic coordination process.   10. We will continue to pursue structural reforms by removingbarriers, unnecessary controls and regulations; increasingcompetition, while mitigating adverse effects on social groups orregions; removing disincentives to work, save, and invest, such asthrough tax reform; and by improving education and training. Thespecific priorities that each of us has identified are outlined inthe attached Annex on Structural Reforms.   11. We welcome the further development of the OECD'ssurveillance of structural reforms. Such surveillance would beparticularly useful in improving public understanding of thereforms by revealing their impact on government budgets, consumerprices and international trade.   12. One of the major structural problems in both developed anddeveloping countries is in the field of agricultural policies. Itis essential that recent significant policy reform effortsundertaken by a number of parties be continued through furtherpositive action by all summit participants. More market-orientedagricultural policies should assist in the achievement of importantobjectives such as preserving rural areas and family farming,raising quality standards and protecting the environment. Wewelcome the OECD's increased emphasis on structural adjustment anddevelopment in the rural economy.   13. Financial and technological innovations are rapidlyintegrating financial markets internationally, contributing to abetter allocation of capital but also increasing the speed andextent to which disturbances in one country may be transmitted toother countries. We will continue to cooperate with other countriesin the examination of the functioning of the global financialsystem, including securities markets.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
