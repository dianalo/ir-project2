A method is presented in this paper todetermine the optimal number of phase shifters and their locations inthe network to minimize line real power losses for a power system insteady state operating conditions. Phase shifters also provide seriescompensation to augment stability. They primarily change damping torquesof machines to improve the machine's dynamic behavior. From the electricaldistance point of view, the phase shifter at a machine terminal givesthe greatest change of electrical distance between that machine and thedisturbance point. Therefore the best location of a phase shifter fora machine is at its terminals. Comparisons are made to show that thephase shifter can significantly increase damping as compared with machineshaving no regulation and machines having exciter-augmented stability.</TEXT></DOC>
