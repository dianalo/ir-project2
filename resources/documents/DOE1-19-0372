A greatly simplified model for thismechanism is described in terms of electron diffusion parameters andthe topography of the galactic magnetic field and predictions are madefor the specific case of Cygnus X-3. EXOSAT results for the energy range2-6 keV have been examined and 'wings' have been identified which couldbe due to the postulated mechanism.</TEXT></DOC>
