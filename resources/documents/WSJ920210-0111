Questions remain, however, on how deep or how lasting thecuts may be. World oil prices may hang on the answers.</LP><TEXT>   This meeting, which begins Wednesday, originally wasplanned as only an informal session of the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries to review world oil markets andpossibly to decide on a second-quarter production level. Butit has recently grown in importance because of signs ofoversupply in world markets.   Now, many oil economists and analysts predict that pricesmay rise -- or fall -- by as much as $2 to $3 a barreldepending on the outcome. And some oil ministers, such asIran's Gholamreza Aghazadeh, and Nigeria's Jibril Aminu, whois also president of OPEC, have warned that prices may crashwhen demand slackens seasonally in the second quarter unlessOPEC's output is sharply reduced from the currently estimated24.2 million barrrels a day.   &quot;This is the most important meeting for OPEC sinceDecember 1985,&quot; when prices also were on the brink ofcrashing, says Bryan Jacoboski, senior oil analyst atPaineWebber Inc., New York.   Mr. Jacoboski is hardly alone, however, in suggesting thatthe ministers are likely to be able to agree on only enoughreductions in their output to hold prices near the currentrange. &quot;There will be sufficient production cuts -- a millionbarrels a day -- to bring the market into approximateequilibrium,&quot; predicts Mr. Jacoboski.   Although oil prices firmed last week as they usually do aweek before an OPEC meeting, West Texas intermediate, or WTI,the U.S. benchmark crude, recently has been priced in a rangeof $18.50 to $19.50 a barrel. The similar crude traded in theU.S. futures market rose 37 cents a barrel Friday to end theweek at $19.87 a barrel for March delivery.   More important to OPEC is the average of a basket of sevencrudes that it uses as a pricing measure. That basket, whichusually lags behind the WTI price by some $2 a barrel,recently has been around $17 a barrel. The reference priceused by OPEC for the basket -- some call it a target -- is $4higher, or $21 a barrel.   Algeria, hard-hit by civil unrest, and some others amongOPEC's 13 members are pressing for a production level thatwould move the exporters toward the $21 price. &quot;There is alevel of production OPEC could cut to if it wants to get to$21,&quot; says Philip K. Verleger Jr., an energy economist who isalso an expert on oil price behavior. To support such aprice, he says, the oil ministers would have to agree to cutstotaling two million barrels a day. He doesn't think thatwill happen.   The consensus appears to be that a 3% to 7% cut inproduction is in the works, although 10% has been mentionedas a remote possibility. &quot;Expectations are for a reductioncloser to 5%,&quot; Platt's Week, an industry publication, willreport today. Excluding Kuwait and Iraq, that would mean acut of nearly 1.2 million barrels a day.   All OPEC members appear to be on board, including SaudiArabia, for a reduction that would at least stabilize pricesat current levels. An OPEC output level of around 23 millionbarrels a day should be a low enough number to carry thegroup through the second quarter without a crisis, saysEdward Krapels, president of Energy Security Analysis, whichmonitors world oil supplies. &quot;I'm bullish on prices,&quot; hesays.   While that wouldn't move OPEC's pricing average toward $21a barrel at this time, it would later, says Mr. Krapels.Demand for OPEC's oil will begin to pick up in the thirdquarter, he notes. He says global economies are slowlyturning around and 1992 world demand for oil should increaseone million barrels a day.   Should OPEC surprise oil markets by cutting by as much as7%, crude prices would probably jump $2 a barrel, says TedEck, chief economist of Amoco Corp. But even with a lessercut, &quot;OPEC will get through the second quarter -- it (OPEC'sdilemma) seems to have become one of the rites of spring,&quot;Mr. Eck adds.   Industry experts are confident that OPEC members will holdto any production-cutting agreement they come up with inorder to prop up prices. There isn't any OPEC nation that anylonger can afford low oil prices, they say. Most are enduringeconomic hardship as indicated by the attempted coup inVenezuela. &quot;This on top of {the unrest in} Algeria means thatthe policy makers {in OPEC} have to step back and reflect,&quot;says Lawrence Goldstein, president of the Petroleum IndustryResearch Foundation, New York. &quot;This has got to get theirattention,&quot; he adds. &quot;There are problems brewing in every oneof the member countries.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
