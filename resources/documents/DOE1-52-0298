For spinorparticles, allowance for the temperature effects leads to a strong suppressionof the process of creation from an initial vacuum state. However if thecreation of the spinor particles takes place from a state described bya thermal density matrix, then the temperature effect on the particlecreation process is relatively weak.</TEXT></DOC>
