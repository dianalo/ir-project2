When Harris Wofford beat DickThornburgh for Pennsylvania's open Senate seat, oneconclusion was that Mr. Wofford had gained ground with callsfor a national-health program. But Bob Kerrey just quit. Hewas the one Democratic presidential aspirant who madenational health, paid for with higher taxes, virtually thecenterpiece of his campaign. We'd conclude from this thatnationalized health is a loser and that Dick Thornburgh lostmainly because no one knew what he stood for. And of courseby his own admission, Senator Kerrey's New Hampshire TV ad infavor of trade retaliation was also a loser. So the primariesare at least teaching us something about what people don'twant from the nation's policy makers. Nonetheless,congressional Democrats, believing that their politicalentrenchment renders public opinion almost irrelevant, willslog forward with plans to nationalize medical care and wagewar against the commercial activities of non-Americans. Wewish Senator Kerrey would give them a tutorial inrepresentative government.</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
