The technique has beendeveloped and the program of calculation of optimum control conditionsduring sorting of non-ferrous metal lump ores has been designed for acomputer. It is shown that during the corresponding choice of anglesat which the radiations come to the detector and according to relationsof intensities lump ore pieces containing not less than 2.0% mercuryor 5% of antimony are clearly separated.</TEXT></DOC>
