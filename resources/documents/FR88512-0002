(FDA is using the term ``conventional food''to refer to food that would fall within any of the 43 categories listedin 21 CFR 170.3(n).) However, the agency did not propose to take any actionon the listing of iron and several iron salts as GRAS substances in dietarysupplements. FDA also proposed to affirm that ferric oxide and oxides ofiron are GRAS for use as indirect human food ingredients. Also in thisproposal, FDA proposed not to take any action on the listing in Part 181(21 CFR Part 181) of iron caprylate, iron tallate, iron linoleate, andiron naphthenate as prior-sanctioned driers that may migrate from foodpackaging material. Additionally, FDA proposed not to affirm that ferricsodium pyrophosphate, iron peptonate, iron polyvinylpyrrolidone, sodiumferric ethylenediamine tetraacetate (EDTA), and sodium ferricitropyrophosphateare GRAS as direct human food ingredients because of a lack of safety anduse data. FDA published this proposal in accordance with its announcedreview of the safety of GRAS and prior-sanctioned food ingredients.In accordance with 21 CFR 170.35, copies of the scientific literature reviewand of the report of the Select Committee on GRAS Substances (the SelectCommittee) on iron and iron salts are available for public review in theDockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, Rm.4-62, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. Copies of the documents arealso available for public purchase from the National Technical InformationService, as announced in the proposal.In addition to proposing to affirm the GRAS status of iron and iron salts,FDA gave public notice that it was unaware of any prior-sanctioned fooduses for these ingredients other than for the proposed conditions of use.Persons asserting additional or extended uses in accordance with approvalsgranted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture or FDA before September 6,1958, were given notice to submit proof of those sanctions, so that thesafety of any prior-sanctioned uses could be determined. That notice wasalso an opportunity to have prior-sanctioned uses of these ingredientsrecognized by issuance of an appropriate regulation under Part 181_SpecificPrior-Sanctioned Food Ingredients (21 CFR Part 181), or affirmed as GRASunder Part 184 or 186 (21 CFR Part 184 or 186), as appropriate.FDA also gave notice that failure to submit proof of an applicable priorsanction in response to the proposal would constitute a waiver of the rightto assert that sanction at any future time.No reports of prior-sanctioned uses for iron and iron salts were submittedin response to the proposal. Therefore, in accordance with the proposal,any right to assert a prior sanction for uses of these ingredients underconditions different from those set forth in this final rule has been waived.FDA received three comments in response to the agency's proposal on ironand iron salts. Two comments were from distributors and suppliers of ironand iron salts. The other comment was submitted on behalf of a chemicallaboratory. A summary of each of these comments and the agency's responsesfollow:1. One comment from a distributor and supplier expressed its support ofthe proposal.The agency acknowledges this comment. Because this comment agrees withthe proposal, the agency has not made any changes in the regulations asa result of this comment.2. Another comment from a chemical laboratory addressed the descriptionfor the preparation of ferrous lactate in proposed andSection; 184.1311.This comment asserted that ferrous lactate can also be prepared by reactingsodium lactate with ferrous sulfate. Additionally, this comment recommendedthat the Japanese Standards of Food additives (JSFA-V; 1986) be consultedin developing specifications for ferrous lactate.The agency has carefully evaluated this comment. The agency agrees thatthe comment describes a reaction that is used to produce food-grade ferrouslactate. Therefore, the agency has modified the regulation on ferrous lactateto include the reaction of sodium lactate plus ferrous sulfate in the manufactureof this substance. The agency will consider the specifications listed inthe Japanese Standards of Food Additives in developing specifications forferrous lactate.3. One comment from a distributor objected to the agency's decision notto affirm as GRAS iron peptonate because of a lack of consumer exposuredata and safety information. The company that submitted this comment statedthat it has been importing iron peptonate and selling it in this country.The company stated that ``during the last 1\1/2\ years [it had] sold atotal of approximately 30,000 pounds.'' The company also stated that ``thematerial is being used by our customers in dietary supplements, veterinaryand possibly other uses.'' However, the comment provided no documentationto substantiate these claims. In the preamble to the proposal, the agency stated that consumer exposuredata and relevant safety information are necessary to evaluate the safetyof a food ingredient. Unless such data and information are forthcoming,the agency has no basis on which to affirm that the use of a substanceis GRAS. No safety information has been provided for iron peptonate, norhas documented evidence been submitted to show that this substance is beingused as a food ingredient and to provide a basis for developing consumerexposure data. In the absence of such information and evidence, the agencycannot affirm that the use of iron peptonate as a food ingredient is GRAS.Persons seeking FDA approval for the direct food use of iron peptonatemay submit a food additive or GRAS affirmation petition in accordance with21 CFR 170.35 or 171.1. In several of the regulations listed in the proposal, the agency inadvertentlyomitted the oxidation state for iron in the more formalized nomenclaturefor iron compounds. For example, in proposed andSection; 184.1298 <T3>Ferric citrate, </T3>the term ``iron citrate'' should have been listedas ``iron (III) citrate'' in paragraph (a). Therefore, the agency is makingthis minor correction in this regulation, and in several others, to reflectthe more formalized nomenclature. Additionally, FDA has edited paragraph(c) of the regulations to clarify it and to eliminate redundancies. Also,the agency has corrected the molecular formula in andSection; 184.1304. In the proposal, FDA stated that it would work with the Committee on FoodChemicals Codex of the National Academy of Sciences to develop acceptablespecifications for several of the iron compounds being affirmed as GRASfor use as direct human food ingredients and would incorporate these specificationsinto the regulations when they were developed. To date, however, work onthe specifications is still incomplete. Until the specifications are developed,those iron compounds for direct food use must comply with the descriptionin the regulations and be of food-grade purity (21 CFR 170.30(h)(1) and182.1(b)(3)). The agency has previously considered the environmental effects of thisrule as announced in the proposed rule of April 21, 1987 (52 FR 13086).No new information or comments have been received that would affect theagency's previous determination that there is no significant impact onthe human environment and that an environmental impact statement is notrequired. In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the agency previouslyconsidered the potential effects that this rule would have on small entities,including small businesses. In accordance with section 605(b) of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act, the agency has determined that no significant impact ona substantial number of small entities would derive from this action. FDAhas not received any new information or comments that would alter its previousdetermination. In accordance with Executive Order 12291, FDA has previously analyzed thepotential economic effects of this final rule. As announced in the proposal,the agency has determined that the rule is not a major rule as determinedby the Order. The agency has not received any new information or commentsthat would alter its previous determination. The agency's findings of no major economic impact and no significant impacton a substantial number of small entities, and the evidence supportingthese findings, are contained in a threshold assessment which may be seenin the Docket Management Branch (address above).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>21 CFR Part 182 Food ingredients, Spices and flavorings.21 CFR Part 184 Food ingredients, Incorporation by reference.21 CFR Part 186 Food ingredients, Food packaging.Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and under authoritydelegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, Parts 182, 184, and 186are amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 182_SUBSTANCES GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS SAFE </ITAG>1.
