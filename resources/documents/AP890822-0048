Heiner Geissler told reporters at a news conference late Mondaythat Kohl told him he would not be renominated at the party'snational conference, which begins Sept. 10 in Bremen.   ``I regret this,'' said Geissler, who has been party generalsecretary for 12 years. ``I think it sends the wrong politicalsignal.''   Kohl planned a news conference today to discuss party issues aswell as the government's plans for responding to a flood of refugeesfrom East Germany.   Like Kohl's reorganization of his 19-member Cabinet in April, theparty shakeup appears aimed at winning back voters who have beendefecting to other parties the past two years.   The Christian Democrats fared poorly in the European Parliamentelections in June, and it lost control of the Berlin and Frankfurtcity governments in other elections this year.   Although West Germany's economic performance has continuedstrong, voters have become increasingly disenchanted with the Bonngovernment's policies toward sharing of NATO defense burdens and thesteady stream of refugees and asylum seekers entering the country.   That dissatisfaction has sent many traditional Christian Democratvoters to the political fringes, boosting support for both theultra-rightist Republicans and leftist parties like the Greens.   Public opinion polls conducted over the past few months haverepeatedly shown the Christian Democrats running a few points behindthe left-leaning Social Democrats in popularity.   The liberal Free Democratic Party, currently aligned to Kohl'sconservative-led coalition, has also hinted recently that it mayswitch allegiances before the next national elections in December1990 if the party continues its slide at the polls.</TEXT></DOC>
