(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When tragedy tore apart Linda Link's life,she struggled with anguish. Then anger. Finally, she turned heremotions into something else _ activism.   She took up the fight for worker safety. It's little solace forthe loss of her son, Jeff, who died in an on-the-job accident, butshe's devoted to the cause. So are her comrades who share hersorrow.   There's Edna Freeze. Her son, Bill, died trying to save Jeff.   And Bob Hensinger. His son, Larry, also was killed in the rescueattempt.   And Sue Irish. Her son, Barney, died, too, rushing to help theothers.   And Brenda Fogle. Her son, Craig, the last man to come to hisco-workers' aid, died last. After two days in a coma, hisrespirator was turned off.   Five families buried sons, their futures unfulfilled, their fatebound in tragedy. Now, more than a year after the young men _ ages19 to 29 _ died in a toxic fume accident at Bastian Plating Co.,their parents are writing letters, calling lawmakers, rallying _and pleading, ``Never again.''   ``If we can do any good, it gives us the satisfaction to knowthat the boys didn't die in vain,'' Mrs. Link said. ``We can'tbring them back, but in their name, we can maybe help make it sothese things don't happen ever again. And it gives us something tothink about other than the tragedy.''   ``You're hoping you'll change things ... you'll get people tolisten,'' Hensinger said. ``It's always worth a try. Only a foolsits back and does nothing.''   The families' goals are modest. No sweeping changes. Just alittle more caution and a lot more accountability from employers.   ``Even if one factory would be really safe, that would make usfeel good,'' Mrs. Freeze said.   The campaigners were brought together by the June 28, 1988,tragedy at Bastian when Jeff was overcome by hydrogen cyanide fumeswhile cleaning a holding tank. Bill, a plant worker just fourweeks, and Larry, climbed in to help, investigators were told.   Barney, once Bill's schoolmate, valiantly tried to save them,according to reports. Then Craig, the last rescuer, slid down theside of the tank, hitting his head, his mother said.   The workers didn't know zinc cyanide residue was in the5-by-4-by-5 tank, said David Bear, spokesman for the IndianaOccupational Safety and Health Administration. Muriatic acid, adilute form of hydrochloric acid, was used for the cleaning, hesaid, and the mixture produced the toxic gas.   IOSHA fined Bastian $41,700, claiming it hadn't providedadequate training, respirators or rescue equipment _ such as alifeline to pull workers out _ nor conducted air tests in the tankbefore anyone entered.   Bastian has contested the ``knowing'' violations and paid theremainder, totaling $1,700. It has declined further comment sincereleasing a statement shortly after the accident saying: ``We aresorry that it took a tragedy of these proportions to focusattention on the issue of industrial safety.''   The parents say they knew the job could be hazardous; their sonscame home with arm or leg burns. Larry even told his ex-wife ```IfI don't get out, the job's going to kill me,''' his father said.``I took it as a figure of speech.''   After the accident, the families say Bastian made a terriblesituation worse by not telling them what happened.   ``We need answers,'' Miss Irish said. ``A lot of them.''   DeKalb County Prosecutor Monte Brown has been asked by a workersafety watchdog group to convene a grand jury probe of theaccident, but has declined comment pending a report from the stateDepartment of Environmental Management.   ``Five guys went to work and expected to return home,'' saidBill Groth, the watchdog group's co-founder. ``They didn't.Something went drastically wrong.''   The families are frustrated, he added. ``They want to know whythere was a delay in calling the ambulances. ... They can't findout what happened to their sons.''   With Groth's guidance, the families have become activists,meeting with consumer groups, holding news conferences and lobbyingfor stronger OSHA enforcement, changes in workers compensation lawsand measures to allow injured employees to sue in cases whereemployers remove warnings or safety devices from machines.   ``It's a good catharsis for them,'' said Groth. ``We'veencouraged them to channel emotions in a positive way, throughpolitical action. ...''   They're also consulting with a lawyer, Mike Kendall, about thepossibility of legal action, though with few exceptions, workerscompensation is the exclusive remedy for on-the-job accidents.   Kendall says the families have been ``radicalized by theexperience.''   At the same time, they've learned a hard civics lesson,discovering that government moves slowly, its agencies hamstrung byrules, laws and dollars.   ``I always thought OSHA inspected every place every year,'' Mrs.Freeze said. ``They don't have the money or the inspectors to doeverything. ... It's going to have to be the employer that's goingto have to look out for his employees.''   ``You get so many slaps in the face, all the things you findout,'' Mrs. Link said.   Workers compensation, for one.   Jeff ``being a single person, all we got was $2,000 for funeralexpenses. They don't give you any compensation ... for the love youlost,'' Mrs. Link said. ``Not that any amount of money can bringhim back.''   Together, the families took flowers to the graves on the firstanniversary of the accident. It helps, but anger remains.   ``They had their whole lives ahead of them. None of them weremarried,'' Mrs. Fogle said. ``You have so many hopes and dreams foryour children. You never think you're going to have to bury yourchildren.''   Now five families live with memories.   Of Barney, who stopped by each morning to tell his mother heloved her.   Of Craig, who had a twinkle in his eye and a passion for music.   Of Bill, who tinkered with cars and hoped to become a dieselmechanic.   Of Jeff, who loved the mountains. His parents plan to etchscenes of Wyoming on his gravestone.   And of Larry, whose tombstone reads: ``He gave his life for acomrade.''   ``You've got to go on,'' his father said, ``or it will eat youup.''   The families are trying to do that, confident their sons wouldbe proud of their crusade.   ``Craig would say, `All right, Mom!,'' Mrs. Fogle said. ``I canjust hear him say, `Go for it!'''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Sharon Cohen is the AP Midwest regionalreporter, based in Chicago.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Tuesday PMs, Oct. 24, and Thereafter</NOTE></DOC>
