The latest frustration for Contra leaders came over aninitiative by Central American nations to disarm rebels camped inHonduras prior to next February's scheduled Nicaraguan presidentialelections.   While President Bush publicly opposes disarming the Contrasbefore the vote, at least one State Department official, OscarSereseres, has told regional leaders the United States might agreeto an earlier date, said rebel director Adolfo Calero.   ``My belief is that these people don't know where they aregoing,'' Calero said of administration officials. ``That shows thelack of a detailed and clear policy.''   He said the confusion ``doesn't contribute to a good outcome ofthe summit'' of Central American leaders later this week.   He also said in the past few days the State Department tried toobstruct a meeting between the Contras and internal Nicaraguanopposition groups, but the participants had gone ahead anyway.   ``It's ridiculous that at such a critical moment there arepersons in the State Department who are trying to usurp'' policy inCentral America, Calero said. ``I would like to hear a singlevoice, we would like them to respect the institutionality of theresistance, not undermine the resistance.''   He warned that the confusion would have serious consequences forthe effort to democratize Nicaragua.   ``It will also have both human and political consequences forthe fate of thousands of Nicaraguans who have fought theSandinistas supported by the U.S. government, armed by the U.S.government and financed by the U.S. government,'' he said.   The Contras at present receive only humanitarian aid from theUnited States as part of a bipartisan foreign policy initiativeaimed at achieving a regional peace in Central America.   Although many rebel fighters have abandoned the struggle,thousands remain camped just across the Nicaraguan border inHonduras.   Calero said the Contras were aware of a proposal by Honduras toenter the Contra camps and disarm the rebel troops, but said suchaction was not likely without the approval of all the CentralAmerican leaders at the summit.   ``They are not going to do it on their own,'' he said. ``They donot want a confrontation with the resistance.''</TEXT></DOC>
