It's muchworse than expected in key locations,'' Foster J. Beach III,regional director of the state Department of Transportation, saidWednesday. ``But I think we caught things early enough to repairit.''   The 85-year-old bridge is one of three that cross the East Riverbetween Brooklyn and Manhattan, and is used by an estimated 100,000cars and more than 400 subway trains a day.   The bridge was abruptly closed to all vehicles Tuesday eveningafter investigators found 30 of the hundreds of steel girdersinspected thus far were rusted out, said TransportationCommissioner Ross Sandler.   Earlier in the week, inspectors had already ordered the closingof the subway lines across the crumbling bridge, and half of thecar lanes were also out of service. The shutdown of the remainingcar lanes made Wednesday's rush hours a nightmare, with longbackups on alternate routes.   At the bridge, which was vacant except for an occasionalpedestrian, bicyclist or reporter, more than 60 inspectors scouredthe span. About 45 percent of the inspection _ the first fullexamination since 1984 _ had been completed, officials said.   Depending on the results of the search and the correspondingrepair of any faults, the bridge could be open in three weeks, saidDeputy Commissioner Samuel Schwartz. But the discovery ofadditional major flaws or repair problems could extend that to amonth or more, he warned.   Both Schwartz and Beach indicated that initial fears that thebridge would never reopen would probably not be realized. Butofficials stressed that the problems at the bridge were severe.   ``We've found 30 faults already, and we could find twice as manytoday,'' said Transportation Department spokesman Victor Ross.``These are sections literally holding on by the paint.''   Mayor Edward I. Koch, after examining the bridge himself,promised the city would not agree to a quick reopening to easecongestion while a long-term solution to the bridge problem issought.   ``It is better to be inconvenienced and safe than convenient anddead,'' Koch said. ``We're going to be very conservative aboutopening this bridge.''   The city is due to decide this summer whether to repair thebridge at a cost Beach estimated at $250 million, or to pay $200million to $800 million to replace it.   As for who is to blame for the rapidly deteriorating bridge,officials pointed back to neglect by previous administrations.   ``The city of New York had no capital budget prior to when Icame in. This bridge has been falling apart since World War II,''said Koch.   ``All of this was preventable by painting ...,'' Schwartzagreed. ``(But) after World War II, the focus was on building newthings. There was no ribbon-cutting for the painting of theWilliamsburg Bridge.''   ``If we'd taken care of it, we wouldn't be talking about thefuneral of the bridge,'' he said. ``We'd be talking about itscentennial.''</TEXT></DOC>
