Nuclear-poweredbases on the moon and Mars will have food-growing capabilities, and throughgas-exchange processes these crops will alter the atmospheric composition.This study focuses on major gases tied to human life support: CO{sub2}, O{sub 2}, and water vapor. Since actual systems are years and likelydecades away, simulation studies can indicate necessary further researchand provide instruction about the predicted behavior of such systems.To look at the first-order plant dynamics, i.e., the production of O{sub2} and water vapor and the consumption of CO{sub 2}, a simulation modelis constructed with crop, human, and waste subsystems. The plant caneither share an atmosphere with the humans or be separate, linked byosmotic or mechanical gas exchangers. The crop subsystem is sketched.Stoichiometric equations for the biosynthesis of protein, carbohydrates,and lipids in the edible portion and carbohydrates, fiber, and ligninin the inedible portion govern growth, mimicking that currently observedin the latest hydroponic wheat experiments.</TEXT></DOC>
