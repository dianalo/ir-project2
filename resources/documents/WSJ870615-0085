Like the other customers, they fill up on &quot;huevos rancheros,&quot; &quot;gorditas&quot; and black coffee. But unlike the others, the illegals glance frequently out the front windows. They watch for the pale-green vans of &quot;la migra&quot; -- the Immigration and Naturalization Service.    I know these people, and I understand why they are nervous. Freddy's is named after me. It has been my family's business since 1981. My parents immigrated to the U.S. from Durango, Mexico. Before our family came to El Paso, we all picked tomatoes and oranges for 13 years in California.    Now, whenever I am here, I help out by waiting on tables. I like the place. The aroma of my mother's fresh corn tortillas is always strong. I like the clientele, too.    But this time, as I move among the tables, I am also working as a newspaper reporter. I am interested in determining how the new immigration law is affecting people like my parents' customers and employees, and I make my assignment known to those I wait on and work with. Most of them seem agitated by the new law. Listening to them while I bring their food and clear away their plates, I can't remember such confusion and frustration here since the peso was devalued in 1982.    This morning, four illegals are sharing a table, taking refills on coffee and talking about the law. One wears a cowboy hat and a tattered Western shirt. Another sports a baseball cap. All of them say they are waiting for someone else to be the first to apply for amnesty.    The new law says anyone who can prove he has been living in the U.S. continuously since 1982 will be granted amnesty, or temporary legal residency, if he applies by May 4, 1988. But illegals don't trust la migra. Some believe the law is a trap, a clever way to round them up and deport them. Others fear that only the rich, or those with connections to the rich, will be allowed to qualify.    Elias, an illegal from Torreon, Coahuila, is trying to persuade his friend Jose to be first to test the law. &quot;Jose,&quot; he says with encouragement in his voice, &quot;you have an honest face.&quot;    But Jose, who comes from my hometown of Gomez Palacio in Durango, isn't convinced. &quot;I dreamed that I went to the migra office,&quot; Jose says. &quot;I walked in through the front door and was immediately escorted to the back door, where a van waited for me. The van was already packed with other 'ilegales'.&quot;    The INS has distributed an estimated 900,000 amnesty applications nationwide since the new law took effect, but only about 80,000 have been filled out and returned. Initially, the INS had predicted that from 1.9 million to 3.9 million illegal immigrants would seek amnesty. Here in El Paso, the INS projected 50,000 applicants by the 1988 amnesty deadline; but by the end of the first month, only 2,121 had applied.    The INS's El Paso office has a bad reputation with many patrons of Freddy's. Last year, in a sting operation, the agency mailed invitations to 250 illegals to attend the grand opening of a car dealership. About 55 showed up. They were greeted by balloons, a clown, free popcorn and vans waiting to deport them.    Still, Juan Campo Silva, an illegal from Chihuahua, suggests: &quot;Maybe the migra is tired of chasing us.&quot; His friends look at him in disbelief. &quot;If you really think that,&quot; Elias says, &quot;why aren't you in line applying for amnesty?&quot;    Mr. Silva shrugs his shoulders. On the jukebox, a song by &quot;Los Coyotes del Rio Bravo&quot; (the Smugglers of the Rio Grande) is playing for the third time. Above the tortilla grill, a candle shrine of San Martin Caballero burns for good luck. Some customers donate their spare change to buy new candles.    These days, many of our customers avoid the morning meal, fearing raids by la migra. Some volunteer to help my father. &quot;The idea is to look busy until the employer arrives,&quot; my father says.    By 8 a.m., most employers have picked up their workers, so Freddy's isn't crowded. Mr. Silva stays and ponders immigration while the jukebox plays a song about illegals picking lettuce, strawberries and grapes.    &quot;I'm more fearful of hunger than I am of laws,&quot; he says. He began coming across the border when he was nine, first selling newspapers and cigarettes and shining shoes. On the advice of his &quot;father,&quot; a university professor here who took Mr. Silva under his wing after seeing him roaming the streets, he moved to El Paso's barrio. Now 27, he is married and has two daughters who were born here. He earns the minimum wage hoeing rows of lettuce. Yet he has no plans to apply for legalization.    &quot;For what?&quot; he asks. &quot;Mexican hands will always be in demand. Besides, I don't want to get excited only to be left standing at the altar.&quot;    A couple of tables away, 44-year-old Diego Armendariz sits alone in a cloud of smoke. He has been coming to the U.S. since 1966 to work as a lettuce picker and cowhand. Recently his employer told him he will lose his job unless he is able to prove legal residency. &quot;This is insane,&quot; he says. &quot;How was I to know then that I needed to keep all my receipts?&quot;    For people like Mr. Armendariz, fake papers are a tempting alternative. And in the neighborhood of Freddy's Cafe, such documents are proliferating.    On a recent Wednesday, my mother hired Jorge, a man off the street, to cut tripe for &quot;menudo.&quot; He volunteered to pick up dirty dishes and to clean tables. Then we caught him soliciting our customers to buy fake passports and birth certificates.    Confronted later while cutting pieces of tripe in a kitchen sink, Jorge pleaded for his job. &quot;You'd do the same thing if you were in my situation,&quot; he explained. &quot;I'm only trying to make a living.&quot; Perhaps, but he wasn't allowed to do table work after that; and after completing his tripe-cutting, he left and hasn't returned to Freddy's since.    By midmorning, Freddy's is practically empty. &quot;The migra must be tough today,&quot; my mother says. Illegals aren't the only ones bearing the brunt of the law here; legal-alien residents and U.S. citizens are feeling pressures because their faces are brown, their hair is dark and they live close to the border.    Julia, a customer of the cafe, was stopped this morning. &quot;I was late for work,&quot; she says. &quot;So I ran. Then I looked around and I saw la migra chasing me.&quot;    &quot;How did you feel?&quot; asks Daniel Ortega, a U.S. citizen who is eating a bowl of soup.    &quot;Like a criminal,&quot; Julia says. &quot;I won't be late for work again.&quot;    Soon a regular customer, known to everyone as &quot;El Guerro,&quot; strolls in and asks for his usual -- coffee and a &quot;burrito.&quot; As always, he wants to know whether Gloria and Manny have heard from the immigration office yet.    Gloria Renteria, 35, of Torreon, Coahuila, is my mother's kitchen helper. Jose Manuel Daray (we call him Manny), 25, of Parral, Chihuahua, is one of my father's food vendors. Both have been here since 1980. Both have applied for amnesty, but it is too early to know whether their claims will be approved.    Even so, Gloria has already given up hope. &quot;I hear that only people with money will be approved,&quot; she says. My mother tells her it isn't true, to be patient.    Manny speaks some English and has hired a private attorney. &quot;I have no fear,&quot; he says. &quot;And if they deport me, so what? It won't be the first time.&quot;    El Guerro stands by the jukebox, picking a song. &quot;What did they say?&quot; he asks anxiously.    &quot;It's too early to know,&quot; I tell him. &quot;Have you applied?&quot;    &quot;No,&quot; he says. &quot;I'm waiting to see what happens to them first.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
