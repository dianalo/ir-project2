(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The federal indictment of PTL founder JimBakker is the latest in a series of woes to befall TV evangelistssince Bakker first resigned amid a sex and hush-money scandal a yearand a half ago.   Scandals rocking the industry have put a choke hold oncontributions, and many so-called televangelists are facing theharsh reality that financial support from the public could becomeincreasingly harder to come by.   Bakker left the Fort Mill-based television ministry and Christiantheme park known as Heritage USA in March 1987, after admitting to asexual encounter with former New York church secretary Jessica Hahn.   Bakker left PTL, which had assets totaling $160 million, withdebts of as much as $130 million. PTL entered federal bankruptcyreorganization proceedings in June 1987.   In May of that year, the Rev. Leroy Jenkins offered to pay theBakkers a total of $175,000 to perform on a weekly television show.Jenkins said his call-in show and faith-healing services from hisHealing Hill Cathedral in Delaware at the time were broadcast onabout 20 radio stations.   Jenkins had spent more than three years in prison, for conspiracyto commit arson and assault, and said his troubles motivated hisoffer to help the Bakkers.   Bakker, and his top aide, the Rev. Richard Dortch, were defrockedlater in 1987 by the Assemblies of God, a Pentecostal, charismaticdenomination.   Revelations of possible homosexual activities and accusations bythe IRS that the Bakkers and top aides took nearly $15 million fromthe ministry in salaries and unjustified compensation seemed toserve as a catalyst for the crumbling of the electronic church.   Less than a year after Assemblies of God minister Jimmy Swaggartblasted Bakker for his sexual indiscretions, the Louisianaevangelist was crying at the pulpit while he admitted that he hadsinned against God and family.   The Assemblies' Louisiana state hierarchy ordered Swaggart toimmediately begin a two-year rehabilitation period that would limithis preaching and place him in counseling. Swaggart resigned fromthe Assemblies of God church in April, just as national churchofficials moved to defrock him.   Another defrocked Assemblies of God minister, Marvin Gorman ofsuburban New Orleans, reportedly hired the men who photographedSwaggart with a prostitute outside a motel.   Even before Bakker and Swaggart, Oral Roberts had made somequestion the credibility of TV ministers.   Roberts, who had built an evangelistic empire including auniversity and a hospital in Tulsa, Okla., told his followers thatGod might ``take me home'' if he failed to raise $8 million by theend of March 1988.   Roberts also claimed to have raised several people from the dead.   The electronic church's troubles led former Republicanpresidential contender Pat Robertson, chairman of the ChristianBroadcasting Network, to say he resented being identified as atelevision evangelist.   Robertson resigned as a Southern Baptist minister and as CBNchairman in October 1987, and stopped appearing as host on ``The 700Club'' TV show.   Audiences for televangelists began to dry up, along withcontributions.   Roberts lost about 35 percent of his audience, according toArbitron figures published in September. The report showed Robertsin July 1988 in the No. 4 spot with 561,000 households, down from863,000 a year earlier.   The Arbitron report showed Swaggart's audience dropped from thetop-rated spot in July 1987 to No.3 in July 1988, with only half theprevious audience. His daily program dropped from 11th to 17thduring the same period, according to Arbitron, which measuresviewership on commercial television stations.   Swaggart's No.1 shw, ``A Study in the Word,'' was replaced by ashow whose host was Robert Schuller, founder of the Garden GroveCommunity Church known for its Crystal Cathedral. Swaggart's showwas seen by 1.19 million households in the summer of 1988;Schuller's show was seen in 1.21 million households.   The Rev. Jerry Falwell, whose Lynchburg, Va., ministry includesthe ``Old-Time Gospel Hour, has said ``the credibility crisis isunbelievable.''   Published reports on Nov. 30, citing tax records, showedcontributions to Falwell's show had dropped by more than $10 millionto $40.7 million, and that the ministry's net worth has fallen bynearly $5 million from last year.   Falwell, who also founded the Moral Majority, briefly stepped into try to salvage PTL after Bakker left.   Contributions to PTL, which at one time bulged to millions, nowbarely manage to equal costs.   The National Religious Broadcasters tried to put the brakes onthe downward slide in February when they adopted a financial andmoral code of ethics. It requires public disclosure of annual,independent audits of all income and expenditures, except forsalaries. The NRB claims 1,350 member organizations.   Billy Graham, considered the father of television evangelism,apparently has managed to remain above the fracas, and said hisministry continues to prosper amid the unholy hubbub.</TEXT></DOC>
