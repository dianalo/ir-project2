Nearly every day brings a fresh report from somewhere: fromPortland, Ore., where skinheads were charged with beating a15-year-old Hispanic girl; from Wellesley, Mass., where two youngmen were arrested for spray-painting swastikas and racist sloganson walls; from New York City, where a gang of white youths wascharged with killing a black man who crossed into their turf.   New organizations have sprung up to fight racism, and police,judges and legislators are taking a harder look at what they can doto prevent such crime.   But among those who closely monitor what are commonly called``hate crimes,'' there is disagreement about whether racism isreally resurgent. Some argue that only the reporting of racialcrime has increased, not the crime itself.   ``The paradox is that the better you are at reporting, the worseyour picture is going to look,'' said Col. Leonard Supenski, whoheads the police crime prevention bureau in Baltimore County, Md.   Supenski speaks from experience. His police department, whosebeat ranges over 610 square miles from the industrial edge ofBaltimore to horse country near the Pennsylvania border, was one ofthe first in the nation to begin reporting hate crimes in acategory of their own.   Baltimore County has kept statistics on RREs _ Racial, Religiousand Ethnic incidents _ since 1979, and its figures show a slightincrease last year after four years of decline.   The increase could be the result of a more sensitive policeforce, quicker to recognize a racist motive behind a crime. Itcould be the result of a more trusting public, more likely toreport a crime. Or it could just be part of what Supenski calls the``ebb and flow'' of crime.   Only a handful of cities around the nation have kept track ofhate crimes for very long; one is New York City, where ``biascrimes'' were down slightly during the first 10 months of 1989.They had been down sharply until Aug. 23, when a gang of whitessurrounded a 16-year-old black youth, Yusuf Hawkins, and shot himto death on a Brooklyn street. Ripples of lesser racial incidents _tauntings, beatings _ spread across the city.   Inspector Paul M. Sanderson, who heads the New York PoliceDepartment's Bias Crime Unit, isn't persuaded that racist crime isreally changing.   ``There is no pattern,'' he said.   Sanderson, 54, is black and recalls hate crime in his youth,although it wasn't called that.   ``I grew up here and I know what went on in this city,'' hesaid. ``And I know that if you went up to a cop and said, ... `Iwas hit in the head with a baseball bat, and I got the injurybecause I'm black and I was in a white neighborhood,' (he'd say),`Get out of here, kid, go on home.'''   Still, for every Paul Sanderson or Leonard Supenski, there areothers who say racist crime is getting worse. They see neo-Naziskinheads pumping new life into the Ku Klux Klan, they hear aboutracism sprouting on college campuses, and they can tick off listsof violent incidents around the country that have nothing in commonbut their motive _ prejudice.   One such person is Bill Tafoya, who teaches long-range planningat the FBI Academy in Quantico, Va., and moonlights at theCongressional Clearinghouse on the Future _ a sort of institutionalcrystal ball. His specialty is civil disorder.   Tafoya has a simple test for gauging the ups and downs ofracism. Every year, he searches a computer database for referencesto four words or phrases _ ``racism or racist,'' ``bigotry,''``white supremacy'' and ``hate groups.''   In 1980, those words appeared 767 times in The New York Timesand The Washington Post. In 1988, the last full year for whichTafoya has records, they appeared 2,122 times _ about a threefoldincrease.   Tafoya concedes that those figures alone don't mean there hasbeen an increase in racism _ it could just be increased interest inthe subject. But he believes the increase is real and says otherresearchers agree.   Besides, police have become interested in hate crime _ Tafoyaknows because he's constantly asked to lecture to them.   ``My warning to them is that if they turn away from the issue... then they're going to be in a very uncomfortable position ofbeing in the middle when the lid blows off,'' he said.   The message is not being ignored. More police departments aroundthe nation are beginning to follow the lead of Baltimore County,New York City and Boston _ pioneers in establishing specialprograms to fight hate crime.   Minneapolis started a bias crime program in 1987; Philadelphia,San Francisco and Portland, Ore., are among other cities that nowpay special attention to hate crime.   Most such programs have two basic goals: to keep separatereports on hate crimes so that investigators can spot patterns, andto assure the public that such crimes will not be tolerated.   ``If the people don't have a sense that they can go the police,and go to the courts, they're going to go to the streets,''explained Sgt. Bill Johnston, who directs the Boston PoliceDepartment's Community Disorders Unit.   Reporting is considered especially important. There are nonational statistics on hate crime now, which is one reason thatpeople disagree about it. A bill pending in Congress would requirethe Justice Department to collect such data.   Those who follow the issue closely, such as Adele Dutton Terrellof the National Institute Against Prejudice and Violence, saypassage of the Hate Crime Statistics Act is essential.   ``People pay attention to hate group activity _ skinheads, theKKK,'' Ms. Terrell said. ``But when you read about crosses beingburned into the lawn of a family that just moved in, or Asians orHispanics being harrassed, people assume these are isolated cases.We need the data to show that's not the case.''   In the meantime, at least 10 states have passed laws in the pastfew years requiring their police departments to collect data onhate crimes. And lawmakers are finding other ways to battle racistcrime.   According to the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, atleast 31 states have passed laws making ``ethnic intimidation'' orharrassment a crime; at least 34 states have made ``institutionalvandalism'' a crime.   Courts are also looking for innovative ways to combat racism. InEugene, Ore., last year, a man convicted of racial intimidation wasordered to attend a racial awareness course in addition to serving60 days in jail.   And last July in Montgomery, Ala., seven Ku Klux Klan membersagreed to attend a similar course as part of an out-of-courtsettlement of a civil lawsuit filed by the Southern ChristianLeadership Conference.   No one believes these measures are going to end racial hatred orstop racial violence. That will require more basic social change.Some hold the economic system responsible; others say the failurehas been in the schools; still others say any change must takeplace in homes, in churches, or in people's hearts.   ``We're doing badly in shaping people and preparing them to goout and get along in life, and to exist and interact with otherpeople in a civilized fashion,'' said Sanderson of the NYPD.``We're all responsible.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, Jan. 15</NOTE></DOC>
