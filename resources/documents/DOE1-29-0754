The installation of thesesystems during August 1986 was the culmination of a cooperative effortbetween The World Bank, U.S. Department of Energy and the Bolivian government.This project was configured to demonstrate, through pilot systems, themany potential benefits of using photovoltaic water pumping in developingcountries. The lessons learned through the procurement and installationof these systems are discussed and the resulting benefits of the projectto international lending institutions, U.S. industry, and the Bolivianparticipants are examined.</TEXT></DOC>
