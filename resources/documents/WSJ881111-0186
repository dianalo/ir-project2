President Lusinchi explained that the country had to diversify an economy that relies on oil for 87% of its export earnings. With oil prices expected to stay low for the foreseeable future, the government is counting on aluminum to generate needed revenue for the country's 18 million residents.    Many Venezuelan businessmen and economists, however, say the government is betting the country's future on a risky proposition. They question whether Venezuela should build up a massive new, state-controlled enterprise at a time when most countries in the world are deregulating their economies and allowing the private sector to increase jobs, production and exports. Indeed, Venezuela offers a prime example of a country where economic controls and regulations designed to diversify the economy and benefit local consumers end up benefiting only the elite and the well-connected at great expense to the whole economy.    The government's Venezuelan Guayana Corporation (CVG) plans to invest $5 billion over the next five years in its subsidiaries involved in the aluminum expansion program: Venalum and Alcasa (the two aluminum companies); Bauxivan (which produces bauxite); Edelca (which generates hydro-electricity); and Interalumina (which produces alumina). With this investment, the government plans to increase aluminum production fivefold by the year 2000 -- from the current level of 400,000 tons a year to two million tons.    &quot;The CVG's expansion programs are essential for the nation's future economic development, because they will provide new sources of foreign-exchange earnings and fiscal revenues for the state -- up to $5 billion annually before the mid-1990s,&quot; CVG President Leopoldo Sucre Figarella said in a recent speech. With oil revenue expected to be $7.5 billion this year, the aluminum income would meet Venezuela's social and economic needs in its post-oil era.    With cheap energy from the giant Guri Dam and huge bauxite reserves in the Guayana region, the government claims Venezuela produces the cheapest aluminum at 36 cents a pound. But the U.S. Commerce Department and several leading analysts abroad say that if government subsidies are factored in, the real figure is 45 cents a pound. If true, Canada, Brazil and Australia produce aluminum at about the same price.    Carlos Sosa, an MIT-educated engineer who has studied the CVG's operations for several years, questions whether the investment plan will generate the projected earnings. &quot;Venezuela doesn't have a lot of margin to be inefficient,&quot; Mr. Sosa says. Nevertheless, the companies are full of fat, he says. According to his research, Venalum spends 29% of its total costs on administration, while the world-wide industry average is only 14%.    Francisco Faraco, publisher of a financial newsletter here, doubts whether CVG can digest the billions of dollars it will receive, remembering that another CVG subsidiary -- the steel company Sidor -- is still recovering from a similar overambitious expansion program in the late 1970s. &quot;CVG doesn't have enough housing and qualified workers,&quot; says Mr. Faraco. &quot;The company can't even manage what it has today. It's important to develop aluminum but not just through the state.&quot;    One reason CVG companies have such high administrative costs is that payoffs are allegedly built into every construction project. The nation's controller general, equivalent to the U.S. General Accounting Office, denounced numerous examples of CVG irregular practices in its 1987 report. Says Rafael Rivero Munoz, a private investigator hired by the opposition Social Christian party (known here as Copei) to examine the widespread charges of corruption with CVG: &quot;There are no controls. Everybody participates in the corruption. . . . In each of the 10 cases we looked at there was a payoff.&quot;    A lawyer who represents multinational companies bidding on CVG projects says his clients complain that the state holding company can take more than a year to determine the winners of construction-project bids because CVG executives fight among themselves over who will receive the bribes the bidding companies are forced to offer. &quot;Telexes get stolen and contracts get copied by rival groups within the CVG,&quot; he says. &quot;You'd think that Accion Democratica {the ruling party} would want to move ahead with these projects since they create jobs and investment, but projects get held up by all this crap.&quot;    Jose Vicente Rangel, who served 25 years as a Socialist member of Congress and is the country's leading corruption watchdog, says CVG has been requiring firms to overpay on construction contracts and then has been using the money to finance the presidential campaign of Carlos Andres Perez -- a former Venezuelan president who is running again as Accion Democratica's candidate. CVG President Sucre Figarella has been in the cabinet of every Accion Democratica government and for years has been the party's chief fundraiser. That may explain why he is the only government member of ministerial rank Mr. Perez has said he'll retain in his cabinet if he wins the Dec. 4 election as expected.    While a small number of politicians and businessmen benefit from cozy relationships developing in the aluminum venture and others like it throughout the Venezuelan economy, the country overall has been the loser. Several recent studies show that over the past decade the rich have gotten richer and the poor poorer. Purchasing power has declined 42% since 1978 in real terms, a development that has especially hit the middle class. Education and public health are worsening for lack of government funds and crime is increasing.    Meanwhile, businessmen have become so uncompetitive that Venezuela's private sector last year exported only $600 million of goods. (Ecuador's shrimp industry alone had exports of $400 million.) In the same fashion, while government regulations are needed to protect consumers and workers, red tape has become so cumbersome that would-be entrepreneurs are frozen out, unless they have good connections within the government. &quot;I have the influence and the economic muscle to get the necessary permits and to go through the red tape in order to get into a new industry,&quot; says businessman Luis Augusto Vegas. &quot;But the young unknown guy with a bright idea has no chance.&quot;    Despite the many charges of mismanagement and corruption, Accion Democratica officials are clearly moving ahead with the aluminum-investment strategy. Their reasons for doing so are thus widely acknowledged as being political, not economic; this plan allows them to retain control over the economy. If Venezuela took the alternative route of reducing its dependence on oil by deregulating the economy, then government bureaucrats could no longer set most prices and wages, determine how much and in what sectors companies could invest, decide what companies could import and export and establish how much of a good many companies could produce.    ---   Mr. Bridges is a free-lance writer who formerly worked at the Daily Journal in Caracas. </TEXT></DOC>
