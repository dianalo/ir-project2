Taylor, resigned both positions and as a director by mutual agreement because &quot;the company needs a new sense of direction.&quot;    The utility, whose former coal-management contracts with a closely held Utah concern have been the object of continuing state regulatory and grand jury investigations, didn't immediately name a successor. But the company said it would undertake an immediate nationwide search and has decided that Mr. Taylor's replacement &quot;will come from outside the company.&quot;    Meanwhile, Frank N. Davis, president of Energy National Inc., a UPandamp;L subsidiary, was named acting president and chief executive and will serve on the board until a replacement is named, Utah Power said.    A utility spokesman denied that the departure of Mr. Taylor, a 34-year veteran of the company, was related to the company's long-running fight with state regulators. But Ted Stewart, chairman of the Utah Public Service Commission, said he viewed the change in management as an overdue step by a &quot;long-troubled company&quot; to put its house in order.    &quot;Apart from the merits of the charges against it, UPandamp;L has been harmed substantially by the controversy and publicity surrounding these matters. These kinds of things hurt, and anything that can be done to put an end to them is welcomed,&quot; said Mr. Stewart.    In November, the Utah Division of Public Utilities recommended that the utility refund about $103 million to Utah ratepayers. The refunds were alleged overcharges due to inefficiency, low productivity and questionable expenses at its coal operations. Until last year, those operations had been run by Emery Mining Co., a division of Savage-Western Industries, a closely held Utah energy and transportation concern.    A special grand jury was convened last year by judges of the third district court in Salt Lake City, in part to probe allegations of misuse and waste of ratepayer money resulting from the utility's contracts with Emery. Those charges surfaced in 1984 after an inside auditor for Emery alleged in a Public Service Commission hearing that Emery engaged in kickback and bid-rigging schemes with certain vendors, abused equipment and passed along exorbitant costs -- including bonuses of liquor and shotguns for managers -- to UPandamp;L ratepayers.    Both UPandamp;L and Emery have denied the allegations. UPandamp;L severed its contract with Emery in April but said the decision stemmed from Emery's inability to obtain adequate liability insurance to protect the utility against third-party claims.    Regulators who have followed Utah Power's problems over the years said the company's decision to seek a president outside the company may be as important as its decision to seek the new leadership itself. Mr. Stewart said Utah Power has tended to choose its leadership from within the company and its directors from within the state, &quot;creating a kind of incestuous relationship between management and the board,&quot; which has proved &quot;stifling.&quot;    &quot;I think that looking outside is a good move,&quot; said Ralph Creer, director of the Division of Public Utilities, which produced last November's critical report. &quot;The implication of our report was that something of a serious nature had to be done.&quot; The report, along with the recommendation that Utah Power make the $103 million refund, is now being considered by the PSC, which is expected to begin hearings on the matter this summer.    Though Utah Power has criticized the report and will fight the recommendation, sources in the company said the utility also isn't anxious for yet another protracted public airing of its controversial dealings with Emery Mining.    Mr. Taylor rose through the ranks at Utah Power to become a vice president in 1969 and director in 1979. In 1982, he was elected senior vice president and became its president in 1984. </TEXT></DOC>
