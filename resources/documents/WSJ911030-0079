Not quite all other businesses. Senators understand theterrifying implications of the law they wrote well enough todeny their employees the right to sue them. Mr. Bush, despitehis brave words about making congressmen abide by the law,gave them a pass here.</LP><TEXT>   Senators yesterday devised ways to avoid the jury trialsthey plan for others. The George Mitchell-Charles Grassleycompromise would let Senate workers appeal from internalprocedures to a federal appeals court, but unlikeprivate-sector workers they couldn't get jury trials orpunitive damages.   Senators tried to justify their exemptions by invokingseparation of powers, but the Constitution lists all theimmunities: Congressmen can't be arrested while at or goingto or from Capitol Hill (except arrests for treason, felonyand breach of the peace), and they can't be sued for whatthey say on the floor of the Senate or House. There is noimmunity for discrimination or sexual harassment. The firstprivate-sector employer sued under this bill should bring anequal-protection clause defense arguing that it's beensingled out as a defendant for not being Congress.   One reason Congress is so edgy about being sued is thatthis bill has little to do with what most Americans considerdiscrimination -- intentional discrimination. The entiredebate instead is about the lawyers' invention ofdisparate-impact analysis, which starts with the assumptionthat there is &quot;discrimination&quot; unless every job filled byevery employer perfectly reflects -- no less and no more --the available labor pool of women, blacks, GreekAmericans,Jews, Aleuts.   The Supreme Court tried in cases such as Wards Cove v.Atonio to avoid this hyperlitigious world by crafting cleardefenses for employers. The justices ruled that plaintiffsmust identify seemingly objective job requirements such astests or educational requirements that excluded them.Plaintiffs would then have to prove that these factors had nosignificant relation to any &quot;business necessity&quot; of theemployer. The civil-rights bill blessed by Mr. Bush reversesthe burden of proof, adding insult to lawsuit by refusing todefine business necessity.   This non-definition definition hints at the mischief ofthis bill, which ensures years of costly lawsuits as judgestry to fathom what Congress meant by a bill thatintentionally doesn't say what it means. The followingsection, entitled &quot;Exclusive Legislative History&quot; (eventhough Ted Kennedy immediately went to the floor of theSenate to give his own interpretation), is supposed to guidejudges as they in effect write the law:   &quot;The terms `business necessity' and `job related' areintended to reflect the concepts enunciated by the SupremeCourt in Griggs v. Duke Power Co. and in other Supreme Courtdecisions prior to Wards Cove v. Atonio.&quot; Under thisnon-standard the justices could simply re-adopt theconstitutional protections they gave defendants. After all,they thought much of Wards Cove was simply a continuation oftheir Griggs analysis of disparate-impact cases. It was in acase decided before Wards Cove that the court insisted that&quot;the ultimate burden of proof&quot; must remain &quot;with theplaintiff at all times.&quot;   No law can amend the Constitution to deprive parties ofdue process, so the provision depriving third parties of theright to challenge consent decrees likely remainsunconstitutional. The bill also gives the justices a newreason to declare punitive damages unconstitutional: Damagesfor sexual harassment would increase with the irrelevancy ofthe size of the workforce, not with the heinousness of theoffense. Harassment remains undefined.   Why did Mr. Bush cave? He must know that labor lawyerstoday are advising clients to avoid litigation by hiring bythe numbers. The likeliest explanation is politics. There'sprobably no better motive for inserting politics into lawthan for a Republican president to twist the law in ways hethinks will appeal to blacks, but does Mr. Bush think it'sgood politics to sacrifice legal principle for supposedracial ends? Judging by recent flip-flops by the White House,the answer is yes. The quota bill is the latest tea leaf thatfor this administration, racial politics trumps law:   -- Mr. Bush this month instructed Solicitor GeneralKenneth Starr to withdraw a key argument in a brief he'dsubmitted to the Supreme Court. The question in U.S. v. Mabusis how much spending Mississippi must do to attractapplicants to historically black public universities. Mr.Starr said the state needs to do more, but that separate butequal is a dead doctrine. &quot;The idea is to end duplication,not to ensure it by ensuring that separate schools are infact equal,&quot; he wrote.   Mr. Starr, who helped craft Dan Quayle's civil-justicereform proposals, warned about the litigation nightmare ifthe justices insist on precisely equal spending. He said thiswould invite &quot;enormous and endlessly litigious undertaking toensure that there are no longer any spending disparities.&quot;   This brief was filed in July, but in September a group ofblack college administrators lobbied Mr. Bush to disavow thislegal argument. He sent the word to Mr. Starr, who on Oct. 10filed a rare, perhaps unprecedented, withdrawal with theSupreme Court. &quot;The time has now come to eliminate thosedisparities&quot; in spending, Mr. Starr wrote. &quot;Suggestions tothe contrary in our opening brief,&quot; a footnote explained, &quot;nolonger reflect the position of the U.S.&quot; Team-player Starr,who often speaks of the importance of the unitary executivebranch, quietly went along with this order from the boss.   -- Months before Lamar Alexander took over at theEducation Department, the agency's top civil-rights official,Michael Williams, declared race-specific scholarshipsunconstitutional. One of Secretary Alexander's first acts wasto put on deep freeze this legal opinion by a politicallyincorrect black lawyer.   Mr. Williams's legal analysis was a routine application ofthe 1978 Bakke decision and other cases prohibitingrace-linked policies except to remedy specific pastdiscrimination. Yet Mr. Alexander announced that race-basedscholarships could continue while Mr. Williams's opinion wasunder review. No word on when, or if, a final decision willbe reached.   Liberals in Congress bear the chief responsibility for thelitigation madhouse this bill creates, but David Duke islikelier to make Mr. Bush bear the political costs. ClarenceThomas proved that all blacks do not bow before the interestgroups that insisted on this bill. It's doubtful that anyonethinks better of Mr. Bush for breaking his no-new-quotapledge.   It won't take long for resourceful lawyers to pump thislawsuit cow for all the cash it's worth. Expect years ofdivisive cases pushing this bill's peculiar definition ofdiscrimination. After all this, at least no one will be ableto argue that litigation leads to harmony.</TEXT></DOC>
