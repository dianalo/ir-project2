NowJackson, with nomination hopes dimming, is pressuring theDemocratic front-runner to adopt even more of his positions.   In speeches, debates and interviews, Jackson seems to beshifting his focus from winning the 1988 Democratic presidentialnomination to trying to shape the party's platform and movingDukakis to the left on spending issues. In that way, he still couldaffect the policies of a Dukakis administration, should theDemocrats win in November.   But Dukakis has not been moved by Jackson's prodding on suchissues as doubling federal spending on education, allocating $3billion in new money to Head Start and laying down a completefederal budget outline.   ``He's doing his thing and I'm doing my thing,'' Dukakis said inLanghorne, Pa. on Monday.   The Massachusetts governor has simply stuck to his own call fornew education initiatives, some without price tags, and his generalsupport for other social service programs. And he says he hasn'tadopted Jackson's positions.   ``These are issues that have been of great concern to me allduring my political career,'' Dukakis said Wednesday, adding thathe and Jackson share more than issues. ``We share a lot of the samegoals and values. We disagree on some things, too, but we've alwaysdone that in a friendly way.''   Jackson has been careful to keep the focus on the issues and notto criticize Dukakis personally.   ``As I seek to make this world better, to bring jobs at home andjustice and peace in the world, we're going to show the differencebetween politics as usual and politics of change,'' Jackson saidWednesday. ``The debate will show differences, but not division.''   In Cincinnati on Tuesday, Jackson said Dukakis had followed hislead on a number of issues.   For example, he said, ``People have told me that Dukakis isgoing into the schools now talking about drugs. Well, that justratifies my leadership. People say you're talking about the samethings. What's the difference? Well, it's butter or margarine. I'mthe real thing.''   Jackson laid down the challenge to Dukakis to adopt more of hispositions in a pair of Pennsylvania debates before Tuesday'sprimary.   ``I've put the numbers together to pay for my dreams,'' Jacksontold Dukakis on Saturday night in Mundall, Pa.. ``I commit myselfto doubling the education budget. It's the best investment. ... Iwant to add $3 billion to Head Start. ... And the war on drugs,it's going to cost.''   When Dukakis replied without giving specific dollar figures,Jackson chided him: ``That is not a commitment to add to HeadStart.''   And on day care and housing, Jackson has said he has specificplans and Dukakis does not.   Jackson also pressed Dukakis to toughen his stance against SouthAfrica, suggesting that that country's government be designated aterrorist regime. Dukakis promises ``tough action'' against SouthAfrica, but he would not adopt Jackson's stance.   The Massachusetts governor said later during the weekend thatJackson's call for him to put out a proposed federal budget isabsurd.   ``One thing I have learned very painfully is that you can't bedrawing up budgets today for next year. No candidate knows exactlywhat you're going to confront,'' Dukakis said.   Referring to his first year as governor _ when he had to renegeon campaign promises on the state budget _ he was emphatic: ``I hadto eat an awful lot of crow and I'm never going to make thatmistake again.''   Dukakis said he would continue to talk about the specificspending measures he wants to discuss.   ``I'll lay out where I'm going to make the cuts _ I've done thatin great detail. I'll lay out where I think we ought to do someinvesting _ I've done that in great detail,'' he said on Sunday.   Dukakis issues adviser Tom Herman says pointedly, ``Jackson hasnot put out a budget either.''</TEXT></DOC>
