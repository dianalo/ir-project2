California, a major battleground in the fall election, put the Massachusetts governor over the top. With 2,082 votes needed to nominate, Mr. Dukakis had approximately 2,876 ballots to 1,218.5 for the Rev. Jackson. In a gesture of reconciliation, California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, chairman of the Rev. Jackson's campaign, went to the podium to ask that the convention make the nomination by acclamation, which it promptly did.    Though never in doubt, the vote marks a turning point for the convention and the governor, whose challenge now is to put his personal stamp on the proceedings when he speaks to the delegates tonight. &quot;It still requires him to seize it,&quot; said Rep. Les AuCoin, an Oregon Democrat and early Dukakis supporter. &quot;He's won the battle of the minds. Now he has to win the hearts.&quot;    Hours before the roll call, Mr. Dukakis and his designated running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, met again privately with the Rev. Jackson, and the discussions were described as part of a promised effort to meld the campaigns. Charles Baker, Mr. Dukakis's national field co-ordinator, said he anticipated Jackson workers would run &quot;a number of states&quot; on behalf of the governor, and discussions among staff continued after the three principals had left.    Appearing before the Southern Christian Leadership Conference earlier in the day, the Rev. Jackson urged greater black participation in the political process, but his impact remains double-edged. His emotional address to the convention Tuesday began as an appeal for common ground but ended tinged with definance as he brought delegates to their feet and urged that they stand by &quot;principle&quot; over &quot;politics.&quot;    &quot;When our family comes together, what we can do is beyond imagination,&quot; he told his audience, and whatever estrangement remains between the Rev. Jackson and Gov. Dukakis, the campaign has brought a reconciliation between the minister and former civil-rights comrades in the black establishment here. In an emotional appearance before the convention last night, Coretta Scott King, widow of slain civil-rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and a past critic, pointedly included Mr. Jackson in her remarks, saying &quot;Jesse, Martin would be proud of you.&quot;    Describing himself as a &quot;very lucky guy,&quot; Mr. Dukakis watched last night's voting from his Atlanta hotel suite, but he has begun quietly to reassert himself after waiting for Mr. Jackson's moment to pass.    A trip to a suburban day camp served to re-emphasize his platform promises of improved drug education, and despite the fanfare around him, he has the manner of a man who knows his own pace. Accepting an extra-large T-shirt from children at the day camp, the governor unabashedly asked for a smaller size closer to his five-foot-eight frame. &quot;If you want me to wear it . . . you've got a large maybe?&quot; he said. &quot;Or a medium?&quot;    Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, the latest in a line of white Southerners given prime spots at the convention, delivered the sole nominating speech for Mr. Dukakis, and the governor's first campaign swing with Sen. Bentsen tomorrow is designed to re-emphasize his commitment to challenge the GOP in every region of the nation. Stops include California's San Joaquin Valley, where Sen. Bentsen's conservative appeal will be tested with Democrats who have backed President Reagan in the past but are crucial to any hopes of the party recapturing the state in November.    The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee released a June survey indicating that Mr. Dukakis enjoyed an approximately 2-1 margin of support among Reagan Democrats nationally. Most strategists believe a victory in California is imperative if Mr. Dukakis is to build a majority in the electoral college. The state's importance is such that it could force Vice President George Bush to pick California Gov. George Deukmejian as his running mate next month. Some Democrats welcome that possibility as an opportunity to defuse the state budget and tax issues that the Bush campaign has used against Mr. Dukakis, as Mr. Deukmejian has had similar problems.    Telephone calls made by Peter Hart Research Associates for The Wall Street Journal indicate the televised proceedings have been a boost for the Democrats, but to the extent Mr. Jackson dominated the first days this week, Mr. Dukakis has made a less certain impression on viewers more removed from the good feelings in the hall. &quot;I guess basically tonight was Jesse Jackson night,&quot; said Steve Metcalf, a California computer programmer, after Mr. Jackson's speech Tuesday night. &quot;He made people feel good about how far a person can get.&quot;    Mr. Hart, a Democratic strategist in his own right, said Mr. Dukakis stood now to capture the unity conveyed by his rival. But behind the remarks of viewers surveyed was also some skepticism that the governor must overcome to be successful. &quot;Dukakis is too vague and very undecided on what he would take a chance on,&quot; said Amanda Fuller, a Santa Fe law student and Democrat in her late 50s.    In Riverside, Calif., a woman pediatrician and a male supervisor, both in their early 40s, reflected a younger, critical view of Mr. Dukakis's treatment of his Democratic rival. &quot;Dukakis did not give any respect to Jackson about the vice presidency, and yet Jackson is giving him the black votes,&quot; said the doctor. The male supervisor said that Mr. Jackson had received a &quot;raw deal&quot; and that Mr. Dukakis has &quot;knocked down every issue that Jackson has come up with.&quot;    &quot;Jackson is a person with great charisma,&quot; he said. &quot;Dukakis would have done a lot better with Jackson as vice president.&quot;    Yesterday's meeting between the two sides was initiated by the Dukakis camp, and the governor personally called Mr. Jackson in the morning to congratulate him on his performance the prior evening. His own speech tonight is expected to be couched in the same lower key that has been his style throughout the long march to the nomination. But it is expected to be more personal in drawing from Mr. Dukakis's life story to project the themes he wants for the race ahead.    Mr. Clinton's remarks offered something of the same, as he sought to make a virtue of his friend and colleague's plodding style next to the Rev. Jackson. &quot;Mike's old-fashioned all right,&quot; Mr. Clinton said of Gov. Dukakis. &quot;He's the kind of man who plays it straight, keeps his word, and pays his bills. In my state, we say he's the kind of man you can 'tie to.'    &quot;He wakes up in the same world every morning, a trait of considerable importance in a president,&quot; said Mr. Clinton, presenting the nominee as a man whose &quot;moral core&quot; and doggedness would carry over to his administration. &quot;He hasn't just played with issues, he's wrestled them to the ground,&quot; Mr. Clinton said. In the same vein, the &quot;unshakable integrity&quot; of Mr. Dukakis, he said, held the promise of &quot;a clean government which once again is devoted to the rule of law.&quot;    In an interview yesterday, Sen. Bentsen said he will play to his own strengths in the South and West, but as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, the conservative Texan said he would maintain an active legislative role to complement the governor's continued power as a state executive. The strategy appears geared to emphasizing the team as a &quot;working&quot; ticket, actively involved in decision-making, in contrast to the less certain role of George Bush as vice president.    Mr. Bentsen said he believed the Democrats now held the &quot;edge&quot; in his native Texas, and he deflected questions about Mr. Dukakis's energy policy by pointing out that the vice president had himself opposed an oil-import fee supported by independent producers in the region. In Louisiana and Oklahoma, Mr. Bentsen said the ticket could be competitive, and his fluency in Spanish will complement Mr. Dukakis's not only in Texas and California but also in New Mexico.    Mr. Bentsen said he would continue to support assistance to Nicaraguan insurgents backed by the Reagan administration, and though he has also endorsed the continuing peace initiative in the region, the Texan said a breakdown of this process could bring potential problems for the ticket. Mr. Dukakis has been strong in opposing any military aid to the insurgents, or Contras, and has benefited both from the general unpopularity of the war at home and a sequence of events, including the Iran-Contra scandal, which hurt the administration.    If the Sandinista regime is seen again as the oppressor, the issue could be a stronger one for Mr. Bush, and in answer to questions, Sen. Bentsen indicated he agreed with this assessment. </TEXT></DOC>
