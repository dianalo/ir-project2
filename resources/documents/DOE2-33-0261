A patient with Miller-Dieker-Syndrome, which is associatedwith lissencephaly, was examined by Computed Tomography (CT) and MagneticResonance Imaging (MRI). While CT demonstrated the main features of lissencephaly,MRI detected disturbed myelination and cell migration in the cerebralhemispheres and a normal appearance of the cerebellum. MRI provides moreaccurate information of the pathomorphologic changes of lissencephalyand is thus superior to CT.</TEXT></DOC>
