Today, many look upon the newcomers as a threat.   ``The locals received their brothers when they were in badcondition. But when they became well, they compete for jobs. So,yes, there is friction between them,'' said Abdel-Rasoul Nour,governor of Darfour region.   The refugees arrive in this Moslem-dominated town of 20,000 at arate of up to 300 a day. They have trekked northward, within 460miles of the capital of Khartoum, in search of food and of safetyfrom civil war between Moslem northerners and the Christian andanimist southerners.   This nation's twin scourges of fighting and famine have reducedhundreds of thousands of Sudanese to homeless nomads who survivemainly through the good graces of international relief groups.   About 2.25 million people live in southern Sudan. Last year, upto 500,000 perished from war and related causes. Many starved todeath in isolated villages.   During the last summer rainy season, between 1,000 and 2,000refugees died in Muglad, according to Mark Cunningham of theIrish-based Concern relief organization. More than half of them werechildren, he said.   Now, about 12,000 people live here as outsiders, and 10,000 moreare expected before the next rainy season.   Muglad, like the government in Khartoum, is mainly Arab Moslem.The displaced newcomers represent an array of African cultures.   The southern rebels are fighting for more autonomy from the northand a greater share of the country's wealth.   The first refugees trudged into Muglad last April. Most have comefrom Aweil, about 150 miles away in the embattled Bahr el-Ghazalregion.   They walked along train tracks, eating shrubs and finding verylittle water. Many of the weak and sick died along the way.   But those arriving look relatively strong. Only a few showreddish-orange hair, a sign of malnutrition.   They live in a makeshift camp on the outskirts of town in stickhuts covered with plastic sheets.   Only a few have found local jobs. Most are totally dependent onfood and water distributed by Concern.   As a group of journalists toured the camp, refugees in rags withcopper bands around their arms and ankles performed a traditionalsouthern dance.   But they had changed the words to fit their new lives:   ``Our homes are destroyed, and we have gone hungry. Life hasbecome very difficult. We wish we could go home. We wish there couldbe peace and we could go home.''</TEXT></DOC>
