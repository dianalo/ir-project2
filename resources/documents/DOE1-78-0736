<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-78-0736 </DOCNO><TEXT>Muon fluence and dose equivalent have been observed at the Fermilab siteboundary for the MC, MW, and NM beam lines. For MC and MW, the 1987 annualdose equivalents of 2.9 and 1.2 mrem respectively, are less than the10 mrem site boundary goal. For the new NM beam line, on the other hand,the observed value 13.1 mrem exceeded this operational goal. Indeed,it was this observation that necessitated the additional ``spoilers''downstream of the E665 experiment. With these magnets in place, however,the 10 mrem goal should not be in jeopardy for future runs.</TEXT></DOC>
