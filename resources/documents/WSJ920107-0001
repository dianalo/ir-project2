In an election in which domestic concerns will dominateand the incumbent's clear strong suit is national security,the Democrats running for president are only rarely engagingPresident Bush on traditional foreign-policy turf.   Instead, they are openly striving to blur the distinctionbetween domestic and foreign policy. Their goal is clear:They want to portray foreign policy as a tool that in thepost-Cold War era should be used largely to advanceAmericans' economic well-being, not simply to protectAmerica's physical security.   &quot;There is a series of Democrats, some of them candidatesand some of them leaders in Congress, who are trying toredefine the concept of what national security is,&quot; saysMadeleine Albright, president of the Center for NationalPolicy, a Democratic research organization.   The key question is whether even wholesale changes in theworld order will end a decade of public skepticism aboutDemocrats' ability to handle national-security issues, or thenew doubts about toughness sown by Democrats' broadopposition to last year's war against Iraq.   For now, though, Democrats are calculating that the end ofthe Cold War gives them at least a chance to change voters'basic thinking about foreign policy. Thus, Arkansas Gov. BillClinton, who has laid out the most detailed national-securitystrategy, proclaims that &quot;foreign and domestic policy areinseparable in today's world&quot; and that today &quot;nationalsecurity is largely economic.&quot; He talks of giving more aid tothe former Soviet republics -- but in large part becausedoing so &quot;will lead to the creation of lucrative new marketswhich mean new American jobs.&quot;   For much the same reason, former Sen. Paul Tsongasproposes giving government loan guarantees and &quot;seed&quot; supportto help U.S. businesses invest in Eastern Europe and theformer Soviet Union.   Similarly, one of the main early foreign-policy proposalsof Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey is the creation of a MultilateralTrade Organization, a powerful international body that wouldstrive to open world markets much as the United Nationsstrives to keep world peace. And all the Democrats arguethat, because the U.S. no longer needs to enlist Cold Warallies against the Soviets, it is free to be tougher withJapan over trade and to demand more progress on democracy andhuman rights before granting trade privileges to China.   Above all, Democrats are seeking to portray President Bushas a leader locked into what Iowa Sen. Thomas Harkin calls a&quot;Cold War mentality,&quot; unable to adjust his thinking orredirect defense spending fast enough to cope with theradically different world created by the collapse of theSoviet Union.   &quot;This is the first post-Cold War presidential campaign,&quot;notes Anthony Lake, a professor and analyst at Mount HolyokeCollege who coordinates foreign-policy positions for Gov.Clinton. &quot;It will decide whether there are new fault lines inthe politics of American foreign policy {or} whether we canachieve something approaching consensus.&quot;   Yet this effort to reframe the debate also is full ofpotential pitfalls for the Democratic challengers. Anycampaign discussion of foreign policy will lead inevitably toa debate over Democrats' broad opposition to the Persian GulfWar. That conflict still is seen by most Americans as asuccess despite its messy aftermath and the survival ofSaddam Hussein.   Virginia Gov. Douglas Wilder says he generally supportedthe decision to go to war, though he says he would have stuckto economic sanctions longer. And Gov. Clinton has chosen totip his hat to Mr. Bush for the decision to fight, declaringin a recent debate that &quot;we all ought to at least admit thatthe president was right to kick Saddam Hussein out ofKuwait.&quot;   But they are alone in their support for the war. Sen.Kerrey and Sen. Harkin voted against the resolution givingMr. Bush the authority to go to war, and now argue that thefailure of the war to end threats from Saddam Hussein orproduce democratic reforms in Kuwait validate their stands.And Sen. Tsongas complains that the U.S. bore far too much ofthe burden for the fight.   The Democratic candidates also may be open to charges ofhypocrisy in their attempt to outflank Mr. Bush on loyalty toIsrael. While complaining in general that the presidentdevotes too much time and resources to foreign policy, theDemocratic candidates also are portraying themselves as moreardent supporters of giving Israel $10 billion in U.S. loanguarantees to build housing for emigrating Soviet Jews.   Mr. Bush last fall forced a four-month delay inconsidering the request, which is likely to be debated inCongress over the next few weeks. He hasn't ever embracedgranting the full $10 billion and may seek to attachconditions requiring Israel to curb settlements in theoccupied West Bank. Most of the Democrats, in contrast, favorgiving the full aid unconditionally, arguing that the U.S.would merely be guaranteeing private loans that Israel can becounted on to repay.   Some slight differences in detail are starting to emerge,however. Over the weekend, Gov. Clinton said in an appearanceon NBC-TV's &quot;Meet the Press&quot; that he might favor somethingless than the full $10 billion and suggested he could backsome delay. By contrast, Sen. Kerrey has urged immediateapproval of the loan guarantees, and Mr. Tsongas says theyshouldn't be tied to Israel's settlements policy.   The broader risk for Democrats is that their intenseeffort to focus on the home front will open them to chargesthat they are closet isolationists who would pull the U.S.back from playing its full role on the world stage.   President Bush and his allies already are pushing thatargument, and in fact there's an element of truth to it insome candidates' proposals. Without providing any specificplan, Gov. Wilder has argued that the U.S. foreign-aid plancan be significantly reduced. And Sen. Tsongas has arguedthat future crises like the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait shouldbe handled by a United Nations Security Force in which U.S.forces would be only a minority of the participants.   But in general, the isolationist charge doesn't seemlikely to stick. The Democratic candidates generally arearguing for a different kind of U.S. engagement in the world,but not an end to the engagement.   &quot;I don't see them going the route of the newisolationism,&quot; contends Rep. Lee Hamilton, a leader of theHouse Foreign Affairs Committee and one of Democrats' leadingvoices on foreign policy. &quot;The isolationist theme emergesfrom the Republican Party, not the Democratic Party, eventhough we have been the party criticizing the president forhis lack of concern for domestic affairs.&quot; Buttressing Mr.Hamilton's point is the fact that the most isolationist voicein this campaign doesn't belong to a Democrat but to PatrickBuchanan, the Republican conservative who is challengingPresident Bush.   For the Democrats, says Clinton adviser Samuel Berger, theend of the Cold War has helped free them from their&quot;quadrennial debate over the Vietnam War&quot; and opened the wayfor new positions on when the U.S. should be engaged abroad.   Thus, Sen. Kerrey has argued that the U.S. shouldn't ruleout using military force to restore the elected government ofHaiti, which was ousted in a military coup recently. Andformer California Gov. Jerry Brown has said he would considersending U.S. troops to help end the civil war in Yugoslaviaif the effort were undertaken in cooperation with Europeanallies.   Beyond such specifics, the immediate challenge forDemocrats is to show that they have the depth of knowledge tohandle foreign-policy issues as well as an experiencedpresident. So far, only Mr. Clinton has laid out a broadstrategy, which was contained in a 14-page address onmilitary and diplomatic policy that he made recently atGeorgetown University.   In it, he proclaimed that the U.S. can cut defensespending by a third by 1997, $100 billion deeper than thecurrent Bush administration plan. He said the Navy shouldreduce its aircraft-carrier task forces to 10 from 12 andsaid the U.N. should consider creating a rapid-deploymentforce to deal with world hot spots.   He also called for diverting more funds from the defensebudget to help the former Soviet Union dismantle nuclearweapons than the $500 million recently approved by Congress.And over the weekend, Gov. Clinton said the U.S. might spenda &quot;couple of billion dollars&quot; helping stabilize former Sovietrepublics -- but in turn would save many billions throughlower defense spending.   The other candidates also are willing to help therepublics, but they differ in their approaches. Sen. Kerreychides Mr. Bush for not being aggressive enough in buildingan &quot;era of cooperation&quot; with the republics; he specificallysays the U.S. should lead other industrialized countries inestablishing a fund of hard currency to cushion the processof making the ruble a convertible currency.   Sen. Harkin approves extending food credits to therepublics now, but says he would approve further aid only ifthe republics agreed to allow the International Atomic EnergyAgency to supervise the removal of any tactical nuclearweapons. And Gov. Wilder says any aid beyond humanitarianassistance should be provided only when the U.S. has beenassured that the republics will cut defense spending.</TEXT></DOC>
