Last year's tally of work stoppages was up from 54 recorded in 1985, the lowest level recorded since the bureau began keeping such figures in 1947.    There were 62 work stoppages in 1984.    All those figures were far below the levels reached in the 1950s and 1960s, when the number of big strikes and lockouts soared as high as 470 a year.    The number of strikes generally has declined in recent years, as workers have grown more concerned about job security in troubled industries and as companies have become more aggressive about resisting strikes by bringing in replacement workers. It isn't known, however, whether the number of lockouts has increased, because the bureau doesn't give specific figures on lockouts.    Last year's work stoppages involved 533,000 employees, up from 324,000 in 1985. The largest strike last year was the June walkout against American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. by 155,000 workers represented by the Communications Workers of America union. The bureau estimated the strike resulted in 2.9 million lost workdays.    The bureau counts as major work stoppages those involving at least 1,000 workers. Stoppages include strikes by workers and lockouts of workers by employers. </TEXT></DOC>
