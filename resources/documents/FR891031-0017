The Commission is specifically granted the authority to issuerules, regulations, orders and instructions pursuant to Title VII of theCivil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-16(b); the Age Discriminationin Employment Act of 1967, 29 U.S.C. 633a(b); the Rehabilitation Act of1973, 29 U.S.C. 794a(a)(1); the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. 201<T3>et seq.,</T3> and E.O. 12067.Pursuant to the foregoing authorities, the Commission is publishing a proposedpart 1614 that fundamentally restructures the Federal sector equal employmentopportunity complaint process. Part 1614 represents the Commission's responseto numerous commentaries on the existing Federal sector complaint process,located at 29 CFR part 1613, that was created by the Civil Service Commissionin 1972, 37 FR 22,717 (October 21, 1972). Recent commentaries on part 1613include a Government Accounting Office Audit Report, comments by the AssistantSecretaries for Management Group, and the latest in the series, the HouseEmployment and Housing Subcommittee's Report, ``Overhauling the FederalEEO Complaint Processing System: A New Look at a Persistent Problem.''H.R. Rep. No. 456, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. (1987).The new part will apply to all counseling efforts pending on or commencingafter the effective date of the regulations as well as to all complaintsfiled after the effective date of the regulations; complaints previouslyfiled will continue to be processed under part 1613. The major differencesbetween part 1613 and proposed part 1614 are discussed below.<ITAG tagnum="84">A. Organization</ITAG>Proposed part 1614 is organized differently than part 1613. Part 1613 isorganized according to the type of discrimination complaint at issue; ithas separate subparts for Title VII complaints, mixed case complaints,age complaints, class complaints, handicap complaints, and old mixed casecomplaints. Proposed part 1614 eliminates the repetition and cross-referencesinherent in the part 1613 scheme by consolidating the complaint processingprocedures as much as possible. It is organized into six subparts. SubpartA concerns the agencies' programs for promoting equal employment opportunityand the procedures for agency processing of individual complaints of discrimination.Subpart B provides additional provisions that are applicable to the processingof particular types of complaints (i.e., ADEA, Equal Pay Act, RehabilitationAct, class). Subpart C explains the relationship between the EEO processand the negotiated grievance process and between the EEO process and appealsto MSPB. Subpart D describes the right and method by which a complainantcan appeal to EEOC and the right to file civil actions under each statuteadministered by EEOC. Subpart E sets forth EEOC's policy on remedies andcorrective action when discrimination has occurred. Subpart F containsmiscellaneous provisions of general applicability to agency EEO programs.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Individual Complaint Process</ITAG>Proposed part 1614 also changes the complaint process for individual complaints.As under part 1613, a person who believes he or she has been retaliatedagainst or discriminated against on the basis of race, color, religion,sex, national origin, age, or handicap must first seek counseling fromthe alleged discriminating agency and then file a written complaint withthat agency. The agency must acknowledge receipt and, if properly filed,investigate. Proposed part 1614, however, eliminates the hearing from theagency investigation stage and requires the agency to investigate, attemptresolution and issue a notice of final action within 180 days. (A complainant'sright to a hearing is being shifted from the agency investigation processto the EEOC appeal process; only the timing of the request, not the rightto a hearing itself, is being modified by the proposal.) Because agencies'responsibilities in the 180-day period are limited to investigation andsettlement attempts, it is anticipated that agencies will be able to completeinvestigations within that time limit.The new procedure allows a large degree of flexibility in the investigationof complaints. The agency can use an exchange of letters, position papers,interrogatories, investigation, fact-finding conference or any other methodor combination of methods that will lead to the development of a completefactual record. Agencies can incorporate alternative dispute resolutiontechniques into their investigations in order to facilitate early resolutionof complaints. The Commission encourages agencies to explore the possibilityof tailoring their investigative procedures to the issue(s) raised in acomplaint and to adopt procedures that emphasize prompt resolution.If the complainant wishes to pursue the matter beyond the agency level,he or she may file a civil action in federal district court or may appealthe notice of final action to the EEOC. In an appeal, EEOC will reviewthe agency record to determine if it is adequate for decision. If it isnot, EEOC will supplement the agency investigation by various methods.It may remand part or all of the matter to the agency for further investigationand may draw an adverse inference if the agency fails to supplement therecord within the time specified by the Commission or it may refer thematter to an EEOC field office for investigation and require that the agencyreimburse the Commission for the investigation. Although andSection; 1613.216(c)of the current regulations provides for reimbursement, it has seldom beenused; the Commission intends to make full use of the reimbursement provisionin the proposed process. If an agency fails to develop an adequate record,the Commission may also send notice of this deficiency to an appropriateagency official or Congressional committee or take other appropriate action.Once EEOC has determined the record is complete, it will so notify theparties and the complainant will have 15 days within which to request ahearing. A party may request that the Administrative Judge issue recommendedfindings and conclusions without a hearing if there are not genuine issuesof fact or of credibility. After the Administrative Judge issues recommendedfindings and conclusions, or after the complainant fails to timely requesta hearing, the EEOC will issue a decision on the appeal and the appellantcan then seek reopening or file a civil action in federal court. By shorteningthe agency processing time, independently reviewing the agency's investigationand, when appropriate, conducting its own investigation, EEOC has attemptedto make the federal sector process more like its private sector chargeprocess.By providing for EEOC review of agency investigations early in the processand for EEOC supplementation of agency investigations when necessary, theproposed part should correct any perceived conflict of interest or unfairnessin the current part 1613 practice of agency self-investigation. The proposedpart should also eliminate the time delays and backlogs frequently associatedwith part 1613 agency complaint processing by limiting agency processingto 180 days and by reducing the number of decision-making levels (proposedpart 1614 eliminates the proposed disposition).<ITAG tagnum="84">C. The Rehabilitation Act and Reassignment</ITAG>In proposed section 1614.103, the Commission defines the scope of the part.In a change from andSection; 1613.701(b), andSection; 1614.103 states thatfor purposes of the Rehabilitation Act, the part applies to military departmentsas defined in 5 U.S.C. 102, executive agencies as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105,the U.S. Postal Service, the Postal Rate Commission and the Tennessee ValleyAuthority. This definition of charge processing jurisdiction is based onthe plain language of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act which limitscoverage to departments, agencies and instrumentalities in the executivebranch, and brings the regulation into conformance with a recent decisionof a United States Court of Appeals. In <T3>Judd </T3>v. <T3>Billington,</T3> 863 F.2d 103 (D.C. Cir. 1988), the court held thatsection 791 of the Rehabilitation Act ``applies only to employees in theexecutive branch. <T3>See</T3> 29 U.S.C. 791(b).'' 863 F.2d at 105. The Commission recentlyacknowledged and adopted the <T3>Judd</T3> decision in <T3>Faucette</T3> v. <T3>Kennickell,</T3> Request No. 05880886 (March 1, 1989).The former Civil Service Commission had authority to issue regulationscovering competitive positions in legislative and judicial branch agencies,5 U.S.C. 7153, however, that authority passed, not to EEOC, but to theOffice of Personnel Management in 5 U.S.C. 7203. EEOC has requested thatthe Office of Personnel Management issue a regulation under section 7203extending regulatory coverage of the Rehabilitation Act to competitivepositions in the legislative and judicial branches. In addition, EEOC hasasked the Interagency Committee on Handicapped Employees to recommend alegislative change to section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act to providecompetitive employees of legislative and judicial branch agencies witha remedy under the Rehabilitation Act.The Commission has taken the position that, under certain circumstances,an agency is required by section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,5 U.S.C. 791, and the Commission's implementing regulations to considerreassignment as a reasonable accommodation. <T3>See Ignacio</T3> v. <T3>United States Postal Service,</T3> Petition No. 03840005 (Sept. 4,1984), upheld, 30 M.S.P.R. 471 (Spec. Panel 1986). The courts have notembraced this position. Congress intended the Federal government to bea model employer of the handicapped and the Commission believes that reassignmentof employees with handicaps who can no longer perform in their positionsis a necessary component of that responsibility. The Commission is, therefore,proposing a new andSection; 1614.203(g), which imposes a duty to considerreassignment as part of an agency's affirmative action obligation undersection 501.The Supreme Court has recognized a distinction in the Rehabilitation Act'scivil rights provisions between nondiscrimination and affirmative action.In <T3>Southeastern Community College</T3> v. <T3>Davis,</T3> 442 U.S. 397, 410 (1979), the Court contrasted the ``evenhandedtreatment of qualified handicapped persons'' required by section 504 withthe ``affirmative efforts to overcome the disabilities caused by handicaps''required by section 501 and noted the requirements of the latter sectionfor affirmative action program plans that describe how the special needsof handicapped employees are being met. The Court reiterated in <T3>Alexander </T3>v. <T3>Choate,</T3> 469 U.S. 287, 300 n.20 (1985), the distinction betweenthe nondiscriminatory reasonable accommodations required by section 504and the affirmative action required by section 501 to effect substantialchanges, adjustments and modifications in existing personnel practices.Section 501 requires each agency to submit an affirmative action programplan for the hiring, placement and advancement of handicapped individualsincluding a description of the extent to which and methods whereby thespecial needs of handicapped individuals are being met.The Commission can require that such plans include reassignment as a methodof meeting the special needs of handicapped employees. As a special affirmativeaction requirement, the reassignment obligation would not be a componentof the statute's reasonable accommodation requirement and would not besubject to the undue hardship limitation. Because this would be a new provisionimplementing the affirmative action requirements of section 501 only, thecase law interpreting reasonable accommodation would be inapplicable. Thus,cases involving reassignment would rely on this new provision and not thereasonable accommodation case law in determining the proper legal standardsfor such reassignments under section 501.The proposed paragraph does not require the Postal Service to reassignan employee to a position in a different craft or to make any other reassignmentthat would be inconsistent with the terms of a collective bargaining agreementcovering an employee. This except for the Postal Service in included inorder to be consistent with the reassignment requirements of 5 U.S.C. 8337and 5 U.S.C. 8451. The Commission seeks comment on this new proposal.<ITAG tagnum="84">D. Opting Out of Class Complaints</ITAG>The Commission proposes to delete the opting out provisions contained inandSection; 1613.605(b). The class complaint regulations are based on Rule23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <T3>See</T3> 41 FR 8081 (Feb. 24, 1976); 42 FR 11807 (March 1, 1977). Rule23 governs class action lawsuits; among other things, it defines the differenttypes of class actions and states the required notice provisions and optingout provisions for each. In court, employment discrimination class actionsare generally treated under subsection (b)(2) of Rule 23, <T3>Holmes</T3> v. <T3>Continental Can Co.,</T3> 706 F.2d 1144, 1152 (11th Cir. 1983). A prerequisiteof a ``(b)(2)'' class is that the defendant ``acted or refused to act ongrounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate finalinjunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to theclass as a whole.'' Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). The right to opt out of sucha class could be inconsistent with the prerequisite of a (b)(2) class thatrelief is appropriate for the class as a whole. Some courts have permittedclass members to opt out of a (b)(2) class but only at the settlement orrelief stage. <T3>Cox </T3>v. <T3>American Cast Iron Pipe Co.,</T3> 784 F.2d 1546, 1554 (11th Cir. 1986).In <T3>Cox,</T3> the court held that it would be an abuse of discretion fora district court to permit a right to opt out at the certification stage,i.e., before the class is identified or before the merits of the classclaim are considered or resolved.Permitting class members to opt out would make the class action mechanismless effective. It would make possible the repeated litigation of patternand practice issues, a consequence that the class action procedure wasdesigned to prevent. <T3>Cox,</T3> 784 F. 2d at 1554. Use of an opt out procedure at the commencementof a class action ``force[s] class members to take a stand against theiremployers in order to stay in a controversial lawsuit.'' <T3>Cox,</T3> 784 F. 2d at 1554-55. It also discourages settlement by makingit impossible to resolve all claims at once and would subject the defendantto the risk that class members will settle only the questionable claimand opt for separate treatment of the stronger claims.<T3> Kincade</T3> v. <T3>General Tire andamp; Rubber Co.,</T3> 635 F. 2d 501, 507 (5th Cir. 1981).An opt out provision is thus inconsistent with the Title VII goal of encouragingsettlement of claims. If the opt-out provision is eliminated from the regulation, all classmembers will still receive notice that the class complaint has been filedand notice of any settlement or decision on the class complaint. If theydo not wish to participate in the class or to file a claim for individualrelief, they do not have to do so. Those who wish to participate will havethe opportunity to object to any proposed settlement and to file claimsfor individual relief if discrimination is found. The Commission believesthat class members' rights are sufficiently protected by the notice provisionsand that the opt-out provision is both inconsistent and unnecessary. Therefore,the proposed regulation omits it.<ITAG tagnum="84"> E. Negotiated Grievance Procedure.</ITAG> Under 29 CFR 1613.219, employees of agencies covered by 5 U.S.C. 7121(d)must elect initially to pursue a matter that is both grievable and allegedlydiscriminatory either through the negotiated grievance procedure or throughthe EEO complaint process, but not both. This regulatory provision alsostates that allegations of discrimination by employees of agencies notsubject to 5 U.S.C. 7121(d) will not be subject to an election and shouldbe processed as complaints under part 1613. The Commission proposes tocontinue this processing distinction between agencies that are and arenot covered by 5 U.S.C. 7121(d). In view of the dual filing and processingresponsibilities that can arise in agencies that are not covered by 5 U.S.C.7121(d), however, the Commission proposes to toll the new 180-day processinglimit for such complaints. If an employee of an agency not covered by 5U.S.C. 7121(d) files an EEO complaint on a matter which is the subjectof a negotiated grievance, the 180-day processing time contained in andSection;1614.106 shall be held in abeyance during the processing of the grievance.This will permit efficient processing of the EEO complaint without undercuttingthe grievance procedure.<ITAG tagnum="84"> F. Time limit For Seeking Counseling</ITAG> Part 1613 provides that unless the time limits should be extended in accordancewith certain criteria, an agency may only accept a complaint if the complainantpreviously sought counseling for the matter within 30 calendar days ofthe date of the alleged discriminatory event, of the effective date ofthe alleged discriminatory personnel action or of the date that the aggrievedperson knew or reasonably should have known of the discriminatory eventor personnel action. Part 1614 continues this 30-day rule and the provisionfor extension of the time limit under certain circumstances. The Commission,however, is aware of concerns expressed by some people that this 30-daytime limit does not provide sufficient time for a potential claimant toevaluate the situation or to decide if he or she wants to pursue the matterin the EEO process, and of suggestions that this period be extended toas much as 180 days. The Commission solicits comment on whether this timelimit should be lengthened, and if so, what the appropriate period forseeking counseling should be.<ITAG tagnum="84"> G. ADEA Statute of Limitations</ITAG> The Commission proposes in andSection; 1614.409(a) to address the absenceof an explicit statute of limitations period in section 15 of the Age Discriminationin Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. 633a, which creates a right of action againstFederal agencies for violations of the ADEA. The absence of an expresslimitations period in a statute does not mean that there is no time limitationfor filing suits under that statue.<T3> DelCostello</T3> v.<T3> International Brotherhood of Teamsters,</T3> 462 U.S. 151, 158 (1983).When a statute is silent, courts borrow a limitations period from a closelyanalogous statute.<T3> Johnson</T3> v.<T3> Railway Express Agency, Inc.,</T3> 421 U.S. 454, 466 (1975). The courts have split on the issue of the correct statute of limitationsapplicable to ADEA lawsuits by federal employees. One court found thatthe two-and three-year limitations period for private sector ADEA caseswas the most analogous limitations period for federal sector ADEA cases.<T3> Weirsema</T3> v.<T3> Tennessee Valley Authority,</T3> 41 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 1588(E.D. Tenn. 1986).<T3> But see Lehman</T3> v.<T3> Nakshian,</T3> 453 U.S. 156 (1981) (the Court held that the federalsector provisions of the ADEA are self-contained and looked to Title VIIrathern than the private sector provisions of the ADEA for guidance ininterpreting the ADEA's federal sector provisions). Other courts have borrowedthe Title VII limitations period as the most analogous.<T3> See Carraway</T3> v.<T3> Postmaster General of the United States,</T3> 678 F. Supp. 125 (D.Md. 1988); <T3>Strazdos</T3> v.<T3> Baker,</T3> No. 88-1520 (S.D.N.Y. July 5, 1988);<T3> DiCamillo</T3> v.<T3> U.S. Postal Service,</T3> No. 87-6028 (D. Conn. April 22, 1988);<T3> Ramachandran</T3> v.<T3> U.S. Postal Service,</T3> No. CV-86-7690 WDK (C.D. Cal. April 15,1987), <T3>aff'd,</T3> No. 87-6028 (9th Cir. May 26, 1988); <T3>White</T3> v.<T3> Department of the Air Force,</T3> No. CA-3-87-1452-R (N.D. Tex. Oct.14, 1987)<T3> aff'd,</T3> 835 F. 2d 871 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <T3>Healy </T3>v.<T3> U.S. Postal Service, 677 F. Supp. 1284 (E.D.N.Y. 1987); </T3><T3>see also Rivera</T3> v.<T3> U.S. Postal Service,</T3> 830 F. 2d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir. 1987) (dismissingADEA claims for failure to file within 30 days), <T3>cert. denied,</T3> 180 S. Ct. 1737 (1988). Three courts have refusedto borrow the 30-day limitations period of Title VII for ADEA actions withoutstating what limitations period should be borrowed.<T3> See Coleman</T3> v.<T3> Nolan,</T3> 49 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 285 (S.D.N.Y. 1988); <T3>Wetzel</T3> v.<T3> U.S. Postal Service,</T3> No. 87-4-CIV-5 (E.D.N.C. Aug. 14, 1987);<T3>Tkac</T3> v.<T3> Veterans Administration,</T3> 610 F. Supp. 1075 (W.D. Mich. 1985).One court applied the six-year statute of limitations contained in 28 U.S.C.2401(a) to a Federal sector ADEA suit.<T3> Marks</T3> v.<T3> Turnage,</T3> 46 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 382 (N.D. Ill. 1988). The Commission finds the reasoning of the cases applying the two- or three-yearlimitations period of the private sector ADEA provisions or the six-yearlimitations periods of 28 U.S.C. 2401(a) upersuasive and the use of thoselimitations periods to be inconsistent with the administrative processutilized for federal sector ADEA complaints. The Commission believes thatthe most closely analogous statutes to the Federal sector provisions ofthe ADEA are section 717 of Title VII and the Civil Service Reform Actand that their 30-day limitations periods should be borrowed for federalsector ADEA lawsuits.Although there are differences between the federal sector provisions ofTitle VII and the ADEA, courts have nevertheless looked to Title VII foranalogous procedures to use in Federal employees' ADEA lawsuits. <T3>See, e.g., Lehman</T3> v. <T3>Nakshian,</T3> 453 U.S. 156 (1981) (as in Title VII action, plaintiffis not entitled to trial by jury); <T3>Ellis</T3> v. <T3>United States Postal Service,</T3> 784 F.2d 835, 838 (7th Cir. 1986)(as in Title VII action, the only proper defendant in an ADEA suit is thehead of the Federal agency); <T3>Smith</T3> v. <T3>Office of Personnel Management,</T3> 778 F.2d 258, 262 (5th Cir. 1985)(like Title VII, the ADEA does not allow recovery of compensatory damages).The use of different statutes of limitations for Federal sector Title VIIand ADEA cases could lead to attempts to split complaints that allege violationsof both statutes or premature departure from the administrative processin order to timely file a lawsuit on the ADEA issue.Further support for a 30-day limitations period is found in the Civil ServiceReform Act (CSRA) and its legislative history. The CSRA provides a 30-daylimitations period for Federal employees to file suit when a claim of agediscrimination is based on an action that is appealable to the MSPB, i.e.,a mixed case involving a claim of age discrimination. <T3>See</T3> 5 U.S.C. 7703(b)(2). This may indicate that Congress intendedor understood that the 30-day limitations period from Title VII appliedas well to ADEA lawsuits. <T3>See</T3> S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 63, reprinted in 1978U.S. Code Cong. andamp; Admin. News 2723, 2785 (``Under the anti-discriminationlaws an employee has 30 days from the final agency action to initiate ade novo court proceeding''). Apart from any indication of legislative intent,it also constitutes another analogous statute of limitations that is availablefor borrowing. It can be argued that it is the most analogous limitationsperiod since it applies not only to employment discrimination actions byFederal employees like Title VII but more specifically to those allegingage discrimination. In the alternative, it can be argued that it is atleast as analogous as the Title VII limitations period to which it is identical.Thus, the CSRA supports the use of a 30-day limitations period for ADEAlawsuits either because its legislative history indicates that Congressintended the Title VII limitations period be applied to ADEA actions, orbecause the CSRA limitations period is the most analogous statute of limitations,or because the limitations periods common to both Title VII and the CSRAshould both be borrowed as the most analogous statutes of limitations.Failure to use the 30-day limitations period for all civil actions underthe ADEA would result in some age complaints having a 30-day limitationsperiod (i.e., mixed case complaints that raise age discrimination) andothers having a different limitations period (i.e., non-mixed case complaints).The Commission, therefore, proposes that the limitations period applicableto suits brought under Title VII and the CSRA be borrowed and applied tosuits brought under section 15 of the ADEA by individuals who have filedadministrative complaints.There are, however, two methods for a Federal employee to pursue an ADEAclaim, i.e., by filing an administrative complaint or by filing a noticeof intent to sue. Where an individual files a complaint, the Commissionbelieves that the 30-day suit period is appropriate. Where, however, anindividual files a notice of intent to sue, the Commission believes thatthe two- or three-year limitations period applicable to private sectorADEA lawsuits is appropriate. The notice of intent to sue procedure clearlycomes from the private sector ADEA process and adopting that limitationsperiod for this purpose is consistent with the case law on borrowing andour approach.<ITAG tagnum="84">H. Exhaustion of Remedies Under the ADEA</ITAG>In andSection; 1614.409(b), the Commission proposes to address the exhaustionof remedies problem raised by the decisions in <T3>Purtill</T3> v. <T3>Harris,</T3> 658 F.2d 134, 137 (3d Cir. 1981), <T3>cert. denied,</T3> 462 U.S. 1131 (1983); <T3>Bunch</T3> v. <T3>United States,</T3> 548 F.2d 336, 340 (9th Cir. 1977), and other cases.These cases hold that once a Federal complainant under the Age Discriminationin Employment Act initiates administrative procedures, he or she must exhaustthese procedures before filing a civil action. As the agency responsiblefor interpretation and enforcement of the ADEA in the Federal sector, theCommission believes that a complainant exhausts administrative remedieseither 180 days after filing a complaint (the time period during whichthe agency is required to issue a notice of final action), or 180 daysafter filing an appeal with the EEOC, if EEOC has not issued a decision,or after EEOC issues a decision on an appeal. This exhaustion requirementis the same as the Title VII exhaustion requirement and will permit thosecomplainants alleging age discrimination as well as Title VII discriminationto bring the entire complaint to court at the same time.The Commission believes that this proposed fundamental restructuring ofthe complaint process will provide more efficient resolution of federalsector employment discrimination complaints while, at the same time, ensuringadministrative fairness.In the process of developing proposed part 1614, the Commission consideredproposals to require payment of interest on back pay in discriminationcases and to provide for awards of attorneys fees in Age Discriminationin Employment Act cases. The Office of Legal Counsel at the Departmentof Justice has advised us, however, of its opinion that the Back Pay Actof 1966, 5 U.S.C. 5596, does not serve as a waiver of sovereign immunityfor those purposes. We are now providing in andSection; 1614.501, therefore,that interest on back pay may not be awarded to federal applicants or employeeswho prevail in discrimination claims. Proposed andSection; 1614.501(e) willremain unchanged from its counterpart in part 1613; that is, the attorneysfees awards provisions shall apply to allegations of discrimination orretaliation prohibited by Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act. In addition to these proposed regulations, the Commission invites commenton whether the Supreme Court's recent decision in <T3>Price Waterhouse</T3> v. <T3>Hopkins,</T3> 57 U.S.L.W. 4469 (May 1, 1989), requires that the Commissionchange its regulation on remedial action, found currently at 29 CFR 1613.271.Section 1613.271 states that full relief should be provided to an individualwhen discrimination is found unless the record contains clear and convincingevidence that the individual would not have been selected even absent discrimination.During the public comment and interagency coordination of the latest amendmentsto part 1613, published at 52 FR 41919 (October 30, 1987), commenters suggestedthat the burden of proof be changed from ``clear and convincing evidence''to ``a preponderance of the evidence'' standard. As a result of these suggestionsand comments, the Commission solicits comment on what effect, if any, theHopkins decision should have on proposed andSection; 1614.501, which is patternedon 29 CFR 1613.271.The Commission also invites comments on whether any of the substantivechanges proposed for part 1614 should also be applied to complaints beingprocessed under part 1613.These regulations have been coordinated with affected federal agenciespursuant to E.O. 12067 and have been reviewed by the Office of Managementand Budget pursuant to E.O. 12291.
