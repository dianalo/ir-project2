The Washington-Baltimore Newspaper Guild, which represents 1,400reporters, editors, and business department workers at the Post,filed a discrimination complaint with the District of ColumbiaOffice of Human Rights on Wednesday.   The union alleges that women and minorities have been treatedunfairly in pay and promotion decisions, and charges that the Posthas steered older, higher-salaried reporters and editors towardretirement.   Those charges were quickly denied by Post officials.   ``The Post doesn't discriminate against any of its employees,''said Bo Jones, legal counsel for The Washington Post Cos.``Salaries are based on individual merit.''   Post reporters make an average of $55,000 per year, he said.   The district's Human Rights Office, which has subpoena powerover wage, hiring and promotional records, cannot force the Post tomake changes in its procedures, but could freeze various city fundsand services the newspaper enjoys if it rules that the unioncomplaint has merit. Such a finding would also strengthen any civillawsuit the union might file against the paper.   ``We don't think it's too much to ask for this great newspaperto investigate charges of discrimination in its own backyard,''said Jill Nelson, an editor on the paper's Sunday magazine whoserves as the paper's union representative.   The guild's complaint was filed on the second day of a protestin which most Post reporters withheld bylines from their stories todraw attention to a lack of progress in contract negotiations.Employees at the paper have been working without a contract for twoyears.   The major contract dispute has been over a wage agreementreached in the 1970s that gave incumbent reporters hefty pay raisesbut did not accordingly adjust wage levels for future newcomers.   The union charges that merit pay increases _ over which unionofficials have no control _ have been used to further separate newwhite male reporters and editors from their black and femalecounterparts.   Jones said the Post has been working diligently to increase thenumber of minorities and women in all departments, butacknowledged, ``Among reporters, for example, you don't have manyblacks coming in at the David Broder level.   ``If you look at salary levels at individual levels, you'll findwhites make more than blacks among reporters,'' Jones said. ``Butif you look at guild-covered editors, blacks make more thanwhites.''   The union claims black female reporters at the Post earn anaverage of $170 less per week than their white male colleagues,even when age and experience are taken into account. According tofigures compiled by the union, white male employees also enjoybetter pay rates than white female workers and other minorities.   The union also charged that the Post's percentage of minorityemployees is insufficient, while Jones claimed that 16 percent ofnewsroom staff is made up of minorities, and 26 percent of newhires in the past two years have been black. Hiring of females alsohas tailed off in recent years, the union charged.</TEXT></DOC>
