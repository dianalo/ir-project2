By a 752-108 margin, United Food and Commercial Workers Local 222 agreed to return to work as early as two weeks from now. Nearly 2,800 IBP employees have been off the job since Dec. 14, 1986.    Bill Schmitz, the union's business agent, said the long dispute was justified in light of the contract gains. &quot;We had no choice -- we were originally locked out. They wanted wage concessions . . . and tried to destroy the seniority language . . . We got that stopped.&quot;    A spokesman for the Occidental Petroleum Corp. unit said the company is satisfied with the settlement and will work for &quot;a new era of cooperation.&quot;    The settlement maintains the wage levels previously in effect for workers hired before Dec. 14, 1986, and provides them with a 15-cent-an-hour increase in the third year of the contract. It also establishes an employee wage tier, which maintains salaries at competitive levels in the industry, the company said. </TEXT></DOC>
