But she gave the Republicanpresidential nominee an ``Incomplete'' for not answering all thequestions.   Bush reiterated his campaign promises to expand Head Start andcreate a new $500 million ``Merit School'' program to helpdisadvantaged children. He also opposed laws that would declareEnglish the official U.S. language.   He did not respond directly to some of the 20 questions the NEAasked on issues ranging from education to Social Security to anuclear freeze, but reiterated his support for tuition tax creditsand merit pay, which the NEA opposes.   Bush, who has said repeatedly that he wants to be ``theeducation president,'' ignored the teachers' questionnaire when itwas sent to him last summer.   Asked why she thought he responded now, Futrell said, ``I thinkhe filled it out because he finally realizes the NEA is a powerfulpolitical entity in this country.''   Nearly one-third of the NEA's 1.9 million members areRepublicans, Futrell said, and ``you just don't blow your nose orfan your hand at 600,000 votes.''   Futrell, whose union is expected to endorse Democratic nomineeMichael Dukakis next Thursday, also defended the Massachusettsgovernor's veto of a 1977 bill requiring teachers to recite thePledge of Allegiance.   ``We believe that the Pledge of Allegiance is very critical andvery important as part of the whole effort to teach patriotism inAmerica. We do not believe that it should be mandated. You cannotmandate patriotism,'' Futrell told a back-to-school news conferenceat the National Press Club.   Bush has made a campaign issue of Dukakis' 1977 veto of themandatory Pledge of Allegiance bill, which the state's highestcourt had advised him beforehand was unconstitutional. Thelegislature passed it over Dukakis' veto.   The Massachusetts law would penalize teachers who refuse to leaddaily recitations of the pledge, but Futrell said it is not beingenforced there or in other states with similar laws.   She said the pledge should not be mandatory for either teachersor students.   ``I have sometimes difficulty dealing with people who dont''stand up to recite the pledge, Futrell said, ``but I respect theirright not to do that. This is a democracy.''   The NEA has been camped in the corner of the Democrats in thepast three elections, and it is expected to be there again Sept. 8when it announces the results of a presidential preference poll of8,400 union activists. It fielded 300 delegates to the Democraticconvention in Atlanta, compared with about 25 at the GOP conventionin New Orleans.   Futrell said she would like to see the next president graduallyincrease the $21 billion Department of Education budget by at least$5 billion to $9 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
