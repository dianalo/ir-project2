Conservation is perceived as a useful but temporaryplayer in the energy supply and demand situation, and when fuel suppliesare ample, the rationale for promoting conservation seemingly disappears.Examples are given to show that traditional methods for forecasting futureenergy consumption do not take into account state-of-the-art efficienciespossible in the end uses of energy. As a first step in a new approachto energy planning, it is suggested that improvements in existing energyefficiencies, if achieved in large quantities on a predictable schedule,constitute an energy resource. Advantages of such an approach includeshort lead times, modest scale of investment, wide dispersal, reducedrisk of investment recovery, flexibility, and increased job creation.Current Canadian policy is more attuned to energy production incentivesrather than to encouraging conservation. Recommendations for a soundenergy conservation program for Canada are summarized in the areas ofpreparation of least-cost energy supply plans, and improving Canada'scapacity to exploit cost-effective conservation opportunities. 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
