Introduction</ITAG>The Department of Energy (DOE) is today proposing to amend its FinancialAssistance Rules to establish standards for program offices in settingup procedures for the objective merit review of discretionary financialassistance applications and to allow recipients of financial assistanceresearch awards expanded authority without obtaining prior approval fromthe Contracting Officer to (1) rebudget among categories; (2) carry overfunds from one funding period to the next; (3) incur limited preaward costs;and (4) extend project periods without additional funds.Also, today's proposed rule establishes an outline for a Department-wideprocess for the review of applications for financial assistance. Requestsfor financial assistance funds are to be reviewed and evaluated by theDOE based on scientific merit of the project, applicant's qualifications,adequacy of applicant's facilities and resources, project appropriatenessto the mission of the DOE, and other appropriate factors established andset forth by the cognizant program office. The DOE review process is toconsist of review by DOE personnel for scientific and technical merit andprogram policy matters and may include external review by Federal (includingDOE) and non-federal personnel either as part of a standing committee,ad hoc committee, or field reader review for scientific and technical merit.The Federal/non-federal composition of the review groups may vary, as longas objective review standards are maintained.There is another provision of this proposed rule which will allow the issuanceof general solicitations such that applications which are in the subjectarea of one of the listed programs may be treated as having been in responseto the general solicitation.Finally, a provision regarding evaluations provides that, upon request,the applicant will receive a written summary of the evaluation.The DOE has concluded that the other proposed changes regarding prior approvals,carryovers, preaward costs and project extensions (which are the DOE'simplementation of recommendations stemming from the Florida DemonstrationProject) will provide additional flexibility to financial assistance recipientsand reduce the work involved in managing financial assistance awards withoutadversely affecting appropriate Federal oversight of certain awards.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Proposed Changes to 10 CFR Part 600</ITAG>Section 600.3 is proposed to be amended by inserting in alphabetical orderdefinitions for ``ad hoc committee,'' ``field readers,'' ``objective meritreview,'' ``responsible official,'' and ``standing commitee,'' and changingthe definition of ``research.''Section 600.9 is proposed to be changed by revising paragraph (a)(1) toprovide authority for program assistant secretaries to issue general solicitations.Paragraph (c)(10) is being amended to allow program offices to establishdue dates or periods appropriate for the receipt of applications. Multiplereceipt dates throughout the year may be established which would permitapplications to be ``bunched'' and reviewed in comparison to each other.Paragraph (c)(12)(vi) is being changed to provide that solicitations mustcontain specific requirements for non-statutory cost sharing when costsharing is to be considered in the selection process.Section 600.16 is proposed to be amended by revising paragraph (a) to establishthe responsibility of the program office for setting up an objective meritreview system and ensuring its satisfactory functioning. A new paragraph(b) is added to set out basic review requirements, including the goal tonormally obtain review by at least three individuals who have no otherresponsibilities concerning the financial assistance applications beingreviewed. A new paragraph (c) has been added to outline requirements forcomparative review. A new paragraph (d) has been added to describe thetypes of review processes which may be used, which include field readers,standing committees, and ad hoc committees. A new paragraph (e) has beenadded establishing a requirement for providing the applicant with an evaluationof his/her application. A new paragraph (f) has been added to address situationsin which the reviewer has an interest in the application being reviewed.A new paragraph (g) has been added to establish deviation procedures fromthis part of the rule. Existing paragraphs (b) and (c) have been redesignatedparagraphs (h) and (i). Section 600.103 is proposed to be amended to eliminate all Federal priorapproval requirements for a recipient of financial assistance researchawards (including those in OMB Circulars A-21 and A-110) except for changein objective or scope, temporary replacement or change of principal investigator,change of key personnel, and change of the institution to which the awardis made. It is also proposed to be amended to establish the authority ofthese recipients to incur preaward costs up to 90 days prior to a new renewalaward. The section also provides that, if a recipient takes such an action,the DOE is not obligated to issue an award. Section 600.106 is proposed to be amended by including a provision allowingrecipients of financial assistance research awards to extend the finalyear of a project period without receiving the prior approval of the DOE.Recipients must take this prior to the originally established expirationdate and notify the DOE within ten days of the extension. Section 600.108 is proposed to be amended to allow recipients of financialassistance research awards to carry over unexpended funds in a continuationaward without the prior approval of the DOE. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Review Under Executive Order 12291 </ITAG>Today's proposal was reviewed under Executive Order 12291 (February 17,1981). The DOE has concluded that the rule is not a ``major rule'' becauseits promulgation will not result in: (1) An annual effect on the economyof $100 million or more; (2) a major increase in costs or prices for consumers,individual industries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, orgeographic regions; or (3) significant adverse effects on competition,employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability ofUnited States based enterprises to compete in domestic or export markets.In accordance with requirements of the Executive Order, this rulemakinghas been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>These proposed regulations were reviewed under the Regulatory FlexibilityAct of 1980, Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, which requires preparationof a regulatory flexibility analysis for any regulation that will havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities;i.e., small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions.The DOE has concluded that the proposed rule would only affect small entitiesas they apply for and receive financial assistance and does not createadditional economic impact on small entities. The DOE certifies that thisproposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities and, therefore, no regulatory flexibility analysishas been prepared. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Review Under the Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>No information collection or recordkeeping requirements are imposed uponthe public by this proposed rulemaking. Accordingly, no OMB clearance isrequired under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501, <T3>et seq</T3>., or OMB's implementing regulations at 5 CFR Part 1320.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Review Under the National Environmental Policy Act </ITAG>The DOE has concluded that promulgation of these wholly procedural rulesclearly would not represent a major Federal action having significant impacton the human environment under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321, <T3>et seq</T3>. (1976)), the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations(40 CFR Parts 1500-1508), and the DOE guidelines (10 CFR Part 1021) and,therefore, does not require an environmental impact statement pursuantto NEPA. <ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Review Under Executive Order 12612 </ITAG>Executive Order 12612 requires that regulations or rules be reviewed forsubstantial direct effects on States, on the relationship between the nationalgovernment and the States, or in the distribution of power among variouslevels of governments. If there are sufficient substantial direct effects,E.O. 12612 requires preparation of a federalism assessment to be used inall decisions involved in promulgating or implementing a regulation orrule. Today's proposed regulatory amendments, when finalized, will have a directeffect of State recipients of financial assistance who receive researchawards. The number of awards effected is very small, however, and thusthere will be insufficient direct effect to warrant the preparation ofa federalism assessment by DOE. <ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Public Comments </ITAG>Interested persons are invited to participate in this rulemaking by submittingdata, views, or arguments with respect to the proposed changes set forthin this notice. Three copies of written comments should be submitted tothe address indicated in the ``<T2>ADDRESS</T2>'' section of this notice. All comments received will beavailable for public inspection in the DOE Reading Room, Room 1E-190, ForrestalBuilding, 1000 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20585, between thehours of 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.All written comments received by April 14, 1989, will be fully consideredprior to publication of a final rule resulting from this proposal. Anyinformation you consider to be confidential must be so identified and submittedin writing, one copy only. The DOE reserves the right to determine theconfidential status of the information and to treat it according to ourdetermination. The Department has concluded that this proposed rule does not involve asubstantial issue of fact or law and that the proposed rule should nothave substantial impact on the nation's economy or a large number of individualsor businesses. Therefore, pursuant to Pub. L. 95-91, the DOE OrganizationAct, and the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), the Departmentdoes not plan to hold a public hearing on this proposed rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 10 CFR Part 600</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Cooperative agreements/energy, Copyrights,Debarment and suspension, Educational institutions, Energy, Grants/energy,Hospital, Indian tribal governments, Individuals, Inventions and patents;Nonprofit organizations, Reporting requirements, Small businesses.In consideration of the foregoing, the DOE hereby proposed to amend ChapterII of Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations by amending Part 600as set fort below.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, March 7, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Berton J.

Section 600.3 is proposed to be amended by adding new definitions for``Ad hoc committee,'' ``Field readers,'' and ``Objective merit review''in alphabetical order and by revising the definition of ``Research'' asfollows: ``Ad hoc committee'' means a temporary committee established to performa single, specific short-term task, after which the committee disbands. ``Field readers'' means persons with expertise to evaluate a specific applicationor category of applications. Field readers may act as independent individualsor as members of a group with the review generally being done by mail.``Objective merit review'' means a thorough, consistent and independentexamination of applications based on pre-established criteria by personsknowledgeable in the field of endeavor for which support is requested.This sort of review is conducted to provide advice to selecting officialsbased on an evaluation of the scientific or technical merit. The reviewersthemselves may be engaged in comparable efforts in institutions or organizationssimilar to the applicant's or have in the past been directly involved insuch activities. ``Responsible official'' means the Heads of Departmental Elements/ProgramAssistant Secretaries. These individuals are responsible for the systemof objective merit review of financial assistance applications funded bytheir program or department element. The functions associated with theobjective merit review may be delegated, but only to the level specifiedin the relevant sections of this part. The responsible official, however,remains ultimately responsible for the execution of these functions. ``Standing committee'' means a long-term committee established to reviewapplications and may be used when required by legislation or when significantnumbers of applications on specified topics are received periodically.``Research'' means any specific or engineering activity which (1) constitutesa systematic, intensive study directed specifically toward greater knowledgeor understanding of the subject studied and contributes to a continuingflow of new knowledge; or (2) is directed toward applying new knowledgeto meet a recognized need; and/or (3) applies such knowledge toward theproduction of useful methods, including design, development and improvementof prototypes and new processes to meet established requirements.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 600.9</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">[Amended] </ITAG>3. Section 600.9 is amended by revising paragraphs (a)(1) and (c)(8), (10),and (12)(vi) as follows:(a) <T3>General. </T3>* * * (1) A Program Assistant Secretary may annually issue a program notice describingresearch areas in which financial assistance is being made available. Suchnotice shall also state whether the research areas covered by the noticeare to be added to those listed in a previously issued program rule. Ifthey are to be included, then applications received as a result of thenotice may be treated as having been in response to that previously publishedprogram rule. If they are not to be included, then applications receivedin response to the notice are to be treated as unsolicited proposals.

Any expectation concerningcost sharing shall be clearly stated. While cost sharing is encouraged,unless the cost sharing expectation is addressed in the solicitation, itshall not be considered in the evaluation process and shall be consideredonly at the time the award is negotiated.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 600.16</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">[Amended] </ITAG>4. Section 600.16 is amended by revising paragraph (a), redesignating paragraphs(b) and (c) as (h) and (i), and by adding new paragraphs (b) through (g)as follows: (a) <T3>General. </T3>(1) Each responsible official must establish and publishin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>the details of the system of objective meritreview which covers the financial assistance program administered by eachcognizant program office within his or her jurisdiction within 120 daysof the issuance of this rule for existing programs and prior to the reviewof applications for new programs. More than one program may adopt the samesystem. If a program wants to review an application or group of applicationsusing the criteria and procedure of an already established review systemother than its own, it may do so by following the deviation proceduresdescribed in paragraph (g) of this section. DOE employees designated byresponsible officials by carry out the review process shall ensure thatthe evaluation of applications is conducted in a fair and objective manner.(2) Objective merit review of financial assistance applications is intendedto be advisory and is not intended to replace the authority of the programofficial with responsibility for deciding whether an award will be made.It is expected that the cognizant project/program officer (scientific monitor)who normally also reviews the proposal for technical/scientific merit,will, additionally, review it from a program policy perspective. Nevertheless,the ojbective merit review system must set forth the relationship betweenthe reviewing individuals, or the review committees or groups, and theofficial who has the final decision-making authority. In defining thisrelationship, the system must set out, as a minimum, the decision-makingand documentation processes to be followed by the authorized official responsiblefor selecting when and adverse recommendation has been received throughthe objective merit review process. (3)(i) This section applies to all new and renewal applications (exceptapplications for conferences/symposia and for awards which come under thecriteria of paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section) in programs which makediscretionary financial assistance awards and to any other financial assistanceprograms in which objective merit review is required by the authorizinglegislation. (ii) For projects in which multiple renewals are probable, an objectivemerit review need not necessarily be done at each renewal, but insteadat appropriate points in the overall project period. A determination thata project need not be reviewed at each renewal shall be made in writingby the project officer at the time the initial award is issued, or at leastone year prior to the date a renewal award would be issued, and concurredin by an official at least one level above the official responsible forselecting the application for award. The determination shall also indicatethe reports required under the award. The criteria on which the determinationthat a project need not be reviewed at each renewal is based shall be includedin the system of objective merit review to be established by the responsibleofficial in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.(4) Each responsible official shall ensure consistency among DOE fieldoffices in the implementation of the review system(s) for his/her programarea. (5) Each formal review system must contain the elements listed in paragraphs(b) through (e) of this section. (b) <T3>Basic review standards. </T3>(1) Each application meeting policy andprogrammatic considerations shall generally be reviewed by at least threequalified persons in addition to the official responsible for selection.(2) The reviewers of any particular application may be any mixture of federalor non-federal experts, including individuals from within the cognizantprogram office, except as indicated otherwise below (see paragraphs (b)(3),(5) and (d)(2)(ii) of this section). The DOE shall select external (non-DOEFederal or non-federal) reviewers on the basis of their professional qualificationsand expertise in the field of research.  (3) In selecting persons in accordance with andSection; 600.16(b) (1) and(2) to review applications, such selection of additional reviewers shouldnot include, to the extent possible, anyone who, on behalf of the FederalGovernment, performed or is likely to perform any of the following dutiesfor any of the applications: (i) Providing substantive technical assistance to the applicant; (ii) Approving/disapproving or having any decision-making role regardingthe application; (iii) Serving as the project officer or otherwise monitoring or evaluatingthe recipient's programmatic performance; (iv) Serving as the Contracting Officer (CO), or performing business managementfunctions for the project; or  (v) Auditing the recipient or the project.Anyone who has line authority over a person who is ineligible to serveas a reviewer because of the above limitations is also ineligible to serveas a reviewer.(4) It may occasionally be necessary, after the fact, to change projectofficer designation, thereby resulting in an individual who participatedin the review of an application being appointed as the project officer.This will not be considered a violation of this policy of objective meritreview provided the assignment was not expected when the review was conducted.(5) Persons outside the cognizant program office must not have been employeesof that office, including having line authority over that office, for oneyear prior to participation as a reviewer in the objective merit reviewprocess for that program.(c) <T3>Comparative review.</T3> (1) In order to enhance the validity of theevaluation and rating process, applications can be evaluated in comparisonto each other.(2) If a program area has established a program notice, the responsibleofficial may implement review procedures which will result in applicationsbeing evaluated in comparison to each other. Applications in response tothat notice may be assigned to a group of field readers, to a standingcommittee, or to an ad hoc committee, as discussed below, which is capableof reviewing them, and may be considered along with other applicationswhich were submitted in response to the program notice or which are eligibleunder the most nearly applicable program announcement. For solicitations,review procedures may also permit comparative evaluation with field readers,a standing committee, or an ad hoc committee being used as appropriate.(d) <T3>Types of review groups_</T3>(1) <T3>Field Readers.</T3> (i) Objective merit review of applications maybe obtained by using field readers to whom applications are sent for reviewand comment. Field readers may also be used as an adjunct to financialassistance application review committees when, for example, the type ofexpertise needed or the volume of financial assistance applications tobe reviewed requires such auxiliary capacity.(ii) Safeguards should be instituted to ensure that field readers clearlyunderstand the process, their role, and the criteria upon which the applicationsare to be evaluated.(iii) For those situations in which a standing committee is the appropriatereview mechanism (see paragraph (d)(2) of this section), but a group offield readers must be used instead, it should function as nearly like acommittee as possible; e.g., readers must receive all of the applicationsto be reviewed even though they are in geographically separate locationsand all field readers should be instructed to follow the procedures establishedfor evaluating the applications.(2) <T3>Standing committees.</T3> (i) Standing committees are normally appropriatewhen required by legislation or when the following conditions prevail:(A) A sufficient number of applications on specific topics to justify theuse of a standing committee(s) is received by the program on a regularbasis in accordance with a predetermined review schedule;(B) There are a sufficient number of persons with the required expertisewho are willing and able to (<T3>1</T3>) accept appointments, (<T3>2</T3>) serve over reasonably protracted periods of time, and (<T3>3</T3>) convene at regularly scheduled intervals or at the call ofthe chairperson; and (C) The legislative authority for the particular program(s) involved extendsfor more than one year.(ii) Persons outside the cognizant program office shall constitute at leasthalf the reviewers on such committees unless a deviation from this requirementhas been approved.(3) <T3>Ad hoc committees.</T3> (i) Ad hoc review committees may not exceedone year in duration and are appropriately used when use of a standingcommittee is not feasible or when one of the following conditions prevails:(A) A small number of applications is received on an intermittent basis;(B) The program is one of limited duration, usually less than one year;(C) The applications to be reviewed have been solicited to meet a specificprogram objective and cannot appropriately be reviewed by a standing committeebecause of subject matter, time constraints, or other limitations;(D) The volume of applications received necessitates convening an additionalcommittee(s) of available reviewers; or (E) It is determined that the applications submitted have special reviewrequirements, e.g., construction of a facility, the complexity of subjectmatter cuts across the areas of expertise of two or more standing committees,or the subject matter is of a special, nonrecurring nature.(ii) Ad hoc committees may not be used for reviewing financial assistanceapplications for any program for which a standing committee has been established(except for paragraph (d)(3)(i)(D) of this section) unless a deviationis approved.(e) <T3>Review summary.</T3> Upon request, applicants are to be provided witha written summary of the evaluation of their application.(f) <T3/><T3>Reviewers with interest in application being reviewed.</T3> Reviewersmust comply with the requirements for the avoidance of conflict of interestestablished in Section 600.17. A committee or group of field readers whichincludes as objective merit reviewers any individuals who cannot meet theserequirements with regard to a particular application being reviewed, e.g.,officials mentioned in paragraphs (b)(3) and (5) of this section, shalloperate as follows:(1) These individuals or officials may not review, discuss, and/or makea recommendation on an application(s) in which they have a conflict ofinterest.(2) In the case of a review committee, the committee member must absenthimself or herself from the committee meeting during the review and discussionof the application(s) in which he/she has a conflict of interest.(g) <T3>Deviations.</T3> (1) In any instance in which a program's preestablishedreview system is not to be used to review an application, group of applications,or class of applications, written prior approval for utilization of a differentprocedure, which itself must, to the extent possible, conform to the provisionsof this section pertaining to objective merit review, must be obtainedfrom the responsible official or his or her designee.(2) If the deviation sought applies to a class of applications and constitutesa deviation from the requirements of this part, approval for deviationmust be obtained in accordance with Section 600.4. If such request fordeviation is approved, all details of the review procedure utilized andthe proceedings and determination must be fully documented.<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG>5.
