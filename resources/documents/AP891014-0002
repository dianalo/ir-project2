Tropical Storm Jerry, which developed rapidly from a tropicaldepression off the Mexican coast on Friday, had maximum sustainedwinds of 70 mph and appeared to be gaining intensity, according tothe National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables.   The center issued a hurricane watch from Port Arthur, Texas, tothe mouth of the Mississippi River. A hurricane warning forportions of the watch area was likely to be issued Saturday.   At 10:30 p.m. EDT Friday, the center of Jerry was located at24.5 north latitude and 93.6 west longitude, or about 425 milessouth-southwest of New Orleans, and moving north at 13 mph.   Oil companies began evacuating offshore rigs and platforms earlyin the day, officials said in New Orleans. More than 4,000 workersin the gulf were to be be brought ashore by helicopter and ship.   ``We started as soon as it became a tropical storm,'' said WendyJacobs of Shell Oil. ``Everyone knows you don't take any chanceswith these.''   The hurricane center advised Gulf Coast residents and marineoperations to closely monitor advisories on the storm.   ``At the moment, Louisiana appears to be in the greatest danger,but the storm could turn over the weekend,'' said forecasterGilbert Clark. A coastal flood watch was issued for the Texas coast.   Rough seas from Jerry also may coincide with an unusualastronomical phenomenon that is expected to elevate average tidesto a 10-year high, said Clark.   The moon, which raises tides with its gravitational pull, willbe both full and at its closest point to the earth next week. Inaddition, the moon's orbit is over the Northern Hemisphere, whichadds to its affect on the seas.   Clark said tides could be up to a foot higher in the Gulf andmore in the open ocean.   ``A situation likes this happens about once every decade,'' hesaid. ``But it also has the reverse affect. Low tides will be attheir lowest.''   Jerry is the strongest tropical weather system since HurricaneHugo ravaged the Caribbean and coastal South Carolina last month.   Tropical depressions become named tropical storms when maximumsustained winds reach 39 mph. Hurricanes are declared when windshit 74 mph. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June toNovember.</TEXT></DOC>
