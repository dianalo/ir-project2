(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Republican National Chairman Lee Atwatertold the nation's mayors today his party is ``not opposed tospending more money on the cities'' and will actively recruit blacksas mayoral candidates.   Atwater said Republicans hope to establish ``a politicalbeachhead'' in the cities by winning the New York mayoral race thisyear.   Atwater, at the annual meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors,steered clear of the Bush administration's differences withRepublican and Democratic mayors on guns and taxes but said thepresident would be responsive to cities.   ``George Bush ... does have the cities in mind,'' Atwater said.``We in the Republican Party are not opposed to spending more moneyon the cities _ we just want to be careful to spend taxpayers' moneyon projects that work.''   More than 200 mayors heard Atwater at the conference, which Bushdeclined to attend. Atwater offered no specifics on urban aid, whichthe mayors want increased.   Later, speaking to reporters, he dismissed disagreements theadministration has with the mayors on resolutions nearing finalapproval by the group. Republican and Democratic mayors have backedpolicy statements calling for an increase in federal taxes and anoutright ban on semi-automatic weapons.   ``There's going to be all kinds of things the mayors and thepresident disagree on,'' Atwater said. ``The fact is there's a verygood spirit down here toward the president.''   Speaking to the largely Democratic group of mayors, Atwaterpointed to his support for efforts to recruit black voters to theGOP. He said it would seek black candidates for mayoral races tooand support them financially.   Atwater singled out for introduction one black Republican mayor,James A. Garner of Hempstead, N.Y. _ but mistakenly first saidGarner was from Schenectady, N.Y.   A resolution calling for legislation far beyond President Bush'smore limited steps against semiautomatics won unanimous approvalSunday from a resolutions committee of the U.S. Conference of Mayors.   It appeared headed for approval from the full group of more than200 mayors before their conference concludes Wednesday.   ``It helps the Congress to have the backing they need to goforward, and to realize there are more people out there in thecities than are in the NRA,'' said Mayor Barbara Fass of Stockton,Calif., who sponsored the call for a ban on possession of theweapons.   Her reference was to the National Rifle Association, which hasbeen the leading opponent of gun control measures across thecountry, including actions to stem the spread of the assault-typeweapons. Those guns are often converted to fully automatic weaponsand are increasingly used by drug dealers in the nation's cities,where drug-related crime has soared.   Fass's city of Stockton was the site of a recent bloody attack inwhich a deranged man fired an AK-47 assault weapon on young childrenin a school yard, killing five and injuring 31. The attackgalvanized opinion against the weapons and prompted California'slegislature to pass tough limits on semiautomatics.   Bush has banned imports of assault weapons. The mayors'resolution would ban domestic manufacture as well as possession.   The mayors considered dozens of resolutions on a wide range oftopics, and were poised to give final approval to a strong newpolicy statement advocating higher federal taxes.   This afternoon, they were to hear from Jack Kemp, secretary ofthe scandal-plagued Department of Housing and Urban Development.   Republican mayors were firmly in support of the call for a taxincrease despite Bush's ``Read my lips'' promise to oppose taxincreases.   The GOP mayors' proposal, adopted in committee without dissent,calls on Congress and the administration ``to raise revenues in afair, equitable and progressive way.'' It says the money raisedshould go to reduce the federal budget deficit and to finance newurban aid.   ``A realistic evaluation of the deficit problem confirms that noeffective deficit reduction approach can be implemented without asignificant infusion of revenues into the federal treasury,'' thestatement says.   Oddly, it was some of the more liberal Democratic mayors whoopposed on tactical grounds the call for higher taxes, arguing thatthe statement might not be well received in Congress, whileRepublicans advocated it in the committees.   ``It makes no sense from a political standpoint to go in thereand say, `we need to raise taxes,''' Mayor John O. Norquist ofMilwaukee told his colleagues in earlier committee meetings.   But Kansas City, Mo., Mayor Richard Berkley, a Republican andpast president of the mayors conference, responded by noting thatthe mayors were asking for money for urban programs and added, ``Thefirst thing anybody is going to ask you is how are you going to payfor it.''   Among the other resolutions was one deploring recent SupremeCourt decisions that civil rights advocates say have weakenedaffirmative programs aimed at ending discrimination in employment.It asks Congress for legislation protecting affirmative actionprograms.   ``The problem with these decisions is it's just opening thefloodgates for negative lawsuits trying to undo just literallyhundreds and thousands of plans all around the country that havebasically been working pretty well,'' said Mayor Bill Hudnut ofIndianapolis, a Republican and head of the mayors' civil rightssubcommittee.   The ban on assault weapons was part of a broad resolution callingfor tougher drug penalties and asking the president to use debtreduction as an incentive for drug-producing countries to stem theflow of drugs. It also asks that closed and under-used militarybases be converted to prisons and drug treatment centers.</TEXT></DOC>
