Porntip Nakhirunkanok, a black-haired Bangkok resident, won$250,000 in cash and prizes, including a sports car and mink coat.She wiped away tears of joy and joined her hands together in a Thaisign of thanks after winning.   The first runner-up was Miss Korea, Yunjung Chang. She wasfollowed by Miss Mexico, Amanda Olivares; Miss Japan, MizuhoSakaguchi; and Miss Hong Kong, Pauline Yeung. Sixty-six women hadcompeted.   Among the 10 semi-finalists was Miss USA, Courtney Gibbs, ofFort Worth, Texas.   Miss Nakhirunkanok, who weighs 114 pounds and stands 5 feet 8inches tall, was educated at Pasadena City College and UCLA insouthern California. She said during the program that she owed herEnglish-speaking ability to Big Bird on the ``Sesame Street''children's program.   Organizers of the 37th Miss Universe pageant estimated 600million people in 57 countries watched the televised competitionfor a successor to the 1987 Miss Universe, Cecilia Bolocco of Chile.   The program was filmed at 9 a.m. Tuesday (9 p.m. EDT Monday)from a 9,000-seat sports stadium in a Taipei suburb so U.S. viewerscould watch during prime time Monday evening. The schedule forcedthe local audience to don tuxedos and evening attire at an hourmore appropriate for reading the morning newspaper over a bowl ofcereal.   The live broadcast seen in Taiwan was briefly interrupted with abulletin for a civil defense emergency exercise in the centralisland.   Missing from this year's festivities was long-time host BobBarker, who resigned after last year's competition in Singapore toprotest the use of furs. He was replaced by television personalityAlan Thicke.   Beauty pageants were banned in 1964 by Taiwan's leaders, whoviewed the competitions as an extravagance for a poor nation andwere dismayed by reports that a Miss China winner performed stripdances in Las Vegas.   The island has since emerged as one of Asia's most prosperouscountries, and authorities lifted the ban last year to clear theway for a domestic airline to sponsor the Miss Universe pageant.There is lingering opposition from a few groups, including retiredsoldiers who view beauty contests as an insult to mothers.   But the telecast generally was seen in Taiwan as an opportunityto present the island to a worldwide audience as the Republic ofChina, the official name of Taiwan seldom used internationallybecause most countries recognize the rival communist Chinesegovernment in Beijing.   Organizers pledged to refer to Taiwan as the Republic of Chinaduring the telecast and promised the two-hour program would haveabout 30 minutes of videotapes taken during recent weeks of thecontestants at scenic spots in Taiwan.   The Miss Universe pageant generated much interest in Taiwan butwas pushed into the background Friday when the island's mostviolent anti-government protest in recent years broke out inTaipei. The 18-hour street battle between protesters and policeleft more than 200 people injured. Nearly 100 demonstrators weredetained.   Prizes for the 1988 Miss Universe include $76,000 in cash, aMaserati convertible automobile, and a mink coat and mink jacket.   The 11 judges include Dick Rutan and Jeana Yeager, who madehistory with their round-the-world flight aboard the Voyager twoyears ago, and Susan Ruttan of the television series ``L.A. Law.''</TEXT></DOC>
