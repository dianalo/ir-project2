The first time would therefore be the only time it was used toprotect the United States against a Soviet nuclear attack, thenewspaper said.   The Post said the conclusions are contained in a report by theOffice of Technology Assessment, a nonpartisan scientific arm ofthe Congress which studied Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiativefor the past two years.   The OTA says in the report that the detailed computerinstructions needed to destroy thousands of warheads streakingtowards the United States probably cannot ``be produced in theforeseeable future,'' according to the newspaper, which said itobtained a copy of the report's summary chapter.   The Post said the report also says that the timetable formissile defense deployment in the mid-1990s established by SDIofficials requires ``an act of faith'' in assuming that the systemcould indefinitely stop a substantial portion of Soviet missilesbecause there is no scientific evidence to date to support theassumption.   The conclusions are among the principal findings of a 900-pagereport on SDI prepared by the OTA's staff, which was given accessto classified SDI data and drew advice from an expert panelcontaining SDI supporters and opponents.   Public release of an unclassified version of the report has beenwithheld for seven months by Pentagon officials, who say itcontains sensitive information, the paper said. Although three ofthe report's chapters remain in dispute, SDI officials last monthcleared nine others, including the summary chapter obtained by thePost.   The OTA report's overall conclusion is that, despite five yearsand $12 billion worth of scientific research, ``many questionsremain about the feasibility of meeting SDI goals,'' which includeat the outset substantial disruption of a Soviet missile attack andin later stages, ``elimination of the threat posed'' by Sovietmissiles, the paper said.   Noting that the nation ``would not want to base a major changein its nuclear strategy on a (missile defense) ... in which it hadlittle confidence,'' the OTA report cautioned that the system'ssheer complexity suggested ``there would always be irresolvablequestions about how dependable ... (the computer) software was.''the Post said.   ``Extrapolating from past experience ... it appears to OTA thatthe complexity of (ballistic missile defense), the uncertainty ...of the requirements it must meet, and the novelty of the technologyit must control would impose a significant probability ofsoftware-induced catastrophic failure in the system's first realbattle,'' the newspaper quoted the report as saying.</TEXT></DOC>
