North broaderaccess to secret government documents for his defense stronglyraises the possibility he won't be tried on the main charges of theIran-Contra indictment.   But the order issued Friday by U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.Gesell clears the way for the fired White House aide to go to trialat least on charges he lied to cover up his activities andpersonally gained from his involvement in the Iran-Contra affair.   The judge's order scheduling the trial for Sept. 20 set thestage for the proceeding to take place in the middle of the fallpresidential campaign.   In addition to fixing the trial date, Gesell ruled that North isentitled to use highly classified documents that might show thecovert activities that are the basis of the Iran-Contra conspiracycharge were authorized by the Reagan administration.   The judge noted that some highly sensitive portions of documentsin the prosecution's case that government security experts wantdeleted ``tended to exonerate North of guilt on certain charges.''   Gesell ruled North was entitled to cite these passages in apublic trial. If the government continues to object, those chargescould be dismissed under the Classified Information Procedures Act,known as CIPA.   The judge further ordered that independent counsel Lawrence E.Walsh and the government must provide North with such highly secretdocuments as references in President Reagan's daily intelligencebriefings to covert aid to the Contras.   The fired National Security Council aide is charged along withformer national security adviser John M. Poindexter and armsdealers Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V.Secord with conspiring to defraud the government by illegallydiverting U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels.   All four defendants, ordered by Gesell to be tried separately,are also charged with theft of government property and wire fraud.   Walsh contends that the defendants corrupted the legitimate,fully authorized presidential initiative of trading U.S. arms forAmerican hostages by funneling weapons-sale proceeds to the Contras.   According to court pleadings by Walsh, some of the documentssought are so sensitive that only the president and a handful oftop officials have access to them.   Gesell said he was not endorsing North's defense or even theadmissibility of the documents as evidence. But he said thematerial should be made available to the retired Marine lieutenantcolonel ``to assure that the truth, whatever it ultimately provesto be, `will out.'''   The judge gave North until Aug. 1 to notify the government ofhis intention to use classified portions of the documents healready has as evidence. He set an Aug. 15 deadline for North tofile a similar list of material turned over as a result of Friday'sorder.   ``A jury trial on those counts remaining after the CIPA processtakes it course is set for Sept. 20,'' Gesell said.   ``It presently appears that, at a minimum, substantive chargesof cover-up, falsification and North's alleged receipt of personalbenefit derived from his conduct as a government employee canproceed to trial,'' Gesell said.   In a brief statement, Walsh said: ``We are ready to proceed asdirected by the court.''   Even if the three major counts are dismissed, North is chargedwith 12 other felony counts, including allegations that he:   _ lied to Congress in 1985 about covert administration aid tothe Contras   _ shredded documents during Attorney General Edwin Meese III'sNovember 1986 investigation of the Iran-Contra affair   _ created phony documents to obstruct an FBI investigation intothe construction of a $15,000 security fence around his home.   _ accepted the fence as an illegal gratuity from Secord.   _ pocketed $4,300 worth of traveler's checks from $90,000 givento him by a Contra leader to defray expenses for helping the rebelcause.</TEXT></DOC>
