But some analysts say the central bank may eschew truly boldmaneuvers in its inflation battle, not wanting to risk recession ata time of unprecedented problems in the savings and loan industry.   The actions last week demonstrated the central bank'sindependence from the Bush administration, which has resisted thenotion that inflation has veered dangerously out of control andbrakes should be applied, in the form of higher interest rates.   To some analysts, the board seemed to be abandoning its strategyof gradually defusing inflationary pressures through small,incremental increases in interest rates.   The evidence they cite is an increase in the federal funds rate,a closely watched interest charge that affects banks' borrowingcosts.   Over much of the past year, the key rate crept up slowly fromjust under 6 percent in January 1988. Lately, its pace has quickenedsharply and by the end of last week it was quoted at 9} percent. TheFed essentially forced the rate up by sucking federal funds out ofthe system.   In addition, on Friday the Fed raised its discount rate, which isthe interest the central bank charges on loans to commercial bankinginstitutions.   The increase to 7 percent from 6.5 percent was seen as a symbolicgesture, underscoring the upward trend in short-term rates. Itfolloweddecisions by the country's commercial banks to hike theirprime lending rates, benchmarks on which interest rates for manyconsumer and business loans are based.   While some analysts were applauding the Fed for administering adose of much-needed monetary restraint, others were unsatisfied withthe strength of the medicine. The doubters are so troubled byinflation that they believe the Fed should wage a much moreaggressive fight.   The debate may be academic.   A number of analysts say the central bank may be kept fromtackling inflation as forcefully as it would like because to do somight endanger economic growth, which could have disastrousconsequences.   A recession would compound the troubles in the savings and loanindustry, possibly bringing down insurance companies in the process,analysts contend. IN addition, a recession would make the debtburdens of consumers, businesses and the government more costly tobear.   ``I do not expect the Fed to raise interest rates significantlyhigher this year,'' said Albert A. Gross, a senior vice president atRefco Inc. ``The problems in the thrift industry and the emergingproblems in the insurance industry will limit the Fed's willingnessto push interest rates higher.''   ``I think the gradualism that the Fed is following is a practicalcompromise,'' he said.   Consumers may take comfort in his opinion about interest rates.The implications for inflation, however, are less soothing.   Allen Sinai, chief economist at Boston Co., finds the latestinflation signs distressing.   ``There are signs that an inflationary spiral has begun. This isworrisome because once inflation starts to spiral it becomes verydifficult to reverse without significant financial restrictions onthe part of the Federal Reseve,'' Sinai said.   The Labor Department reported last week that consumer prices shotup 0.6 percent in January, or the equivalent of a 7.2 percent annualrate. By contrast, the Consumer Price Index rose 1.1 percent in 1986.   Prices at the wholesale level are surging, too, implying thatretail prices in the months ahead will move higher.   ``Consumers are going to be slowly squeezed by both higherinterest rates and inflation,'' Sinai said. ``The message is thecentral bank wants consumers to slow down spending.''   ``Everyone is raising their inflation expectations,'' said DonaldRatajczak, head of the Economic Forecaster Center at Georgia StateUniversity. ``The Fed is now starting to make a moderate response.Half the cows are out of the barn but it's still worthwhile to closethe gate before all of them are gone.''   By pursuing its gradual approach in the past, the Fed made theproblem worse, Ratajczak said. What they should have done is takeswift, dramatic action.   ``The Fed always follows gradualism and it never works. And youhave to ask after awhile,`Don't they read their own history?'''</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Monday Feb. 27.</NOTE></DOC>
