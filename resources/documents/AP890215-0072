The managing director of Recruit Co., a fast-growing businessinformation conglomerate, and the managing director of a real estatesubsidiary, Recruit-Cosmos Co., were arrested on charges ofviolating the Securities and Exchange Law, television and newsagency reports said.   They identified those arrested as Shunjiro Mamiya of Recruit andSeiichi Tateoka of Recruit-Cosmos.   Prosecution officials refused to discuss the reports, saying theywould talk only to reporters from a handful of Japanese newsorganizations assigned to covering their office.   The parent company sold valuable stocks in the subsidiary todozens of politicians, their aides and influential businessmen andjournalists.   Today's reported arrests came two days after the parent company'sfounder and three others were arrested on bribery charges.   Prosecutors Monday arrested Recruit's founder, Hiromasa Ezoe, anexecutive of a Recruit-affiliated finance company and two executivesof Nippon Telephone and Telegraph Corp., Japan's largest company.   Recruit-Cosmos sold hundreds of thousands of shares prior totheir public listing to the political and business figures. Thestocks soared in value after being made available forover-the-counter trading, bringing huge profits to the purchasers.   Those arrested Monday were held on suspicion of bribery involvingresale of U.S.-made supercomputers by NTT to Recruit and leasingtelephone lines to Recruit at discount prices.   Thirty officers from the prosecutors office searched NTT'sdowntown Tokyo offices for more than eight hours Tuesday,confiscating documents that filled 70 boxes.   Mamiya played a central role in the sale of Recruit-Cosmosstocks, while Tateoka looked after the financial aspect of thetransactions, according to the reports.   The sales were not illegal under Japanese law, but give theimpression of influence-peddling and raised outcries among thepublic and in Parliament about political fundraising and ethics ingovernment.   More than a dozen members of Parliament _ including threeincumbent Cabinet ministers _ former top bureaucrats and seniorbusinessmen have stepped down from public positions because of theirlink to the scandal.   Most of the politicians and political aides so far named in theRecruit affair have come from Prime Minister Takeshita's governingLiberal Democratic Party, which has come under increasingly harshpublic criticism because of the scandal.   The Liberal Democrats lost a Parliamentary seat to the JapanSocialist Party in a by-election last Sunday in what was widely seenas a referendum on public support for Takeshita's government.   Opposition parties have repeatedly insisted that Takeshita andhis Cabinet resign over the affair, but Takeshita has rejected thecalls.</TEXT></DOC>
