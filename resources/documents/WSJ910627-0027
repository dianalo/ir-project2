State and federal agencies have been working on the islandof Hawaii in recent months to harness geothermal energy fromaround the Kilauea Volcano. The island state's goal is toreduce its nearly total dependence on petroleum exportsthrough use of geothermal and other alternative energysources.</LP><TEXT>   But a number of environmental groups objected to thedrilling and last year filed a lawsuit in Honolulu federalcourt to halt federal participation in the Hawaii GeothermalEnergy Project pending an environmental review, which couldtake two years. On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge David Ezraruled in favor of the plaintiffs, blocking about $5 millionin federal funding for the project.   Though nine federal agencies involved in the project noware prohibited from proceeding, the state of Hawaii has beenconducting its own program that is unaffected.   Hawaii hopes to generate 25 megawatts of geothermal powerfor use on the island by the end of this year, said MauriceKaya, energy program administrator for the state. Ultimately,he said, state officials would like to see geothermal energysupplied to Oahu and Maui through overland and underseascables.</TEXT></DOC>
