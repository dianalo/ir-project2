Some 2,000 students from about 30 colleges took part in therally on the outskirts of southern Seoul to denounce the Rohadministration and call for the expulsion of U.S. forces based inSouth Korea.   ``Down with the fascist regime which suppresses the masses,''the students chanted. ``Yankee go home.''   The leaders charged that the Roh administration was a front formilitary rule and insisted there had been no democratic reforms inSouth Korea.   Roh, a former general who won presidential elections inDecember, has helped introduce broad democratic reforms sincetaking power. He has pledged to end authoritarian rule and makeSouth Korea a full democracy.   The students marched out of the school and clashed on thehighway outside with hundreds of riot police.
