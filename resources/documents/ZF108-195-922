(computer-controlled consumer products) (column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Dvorak, John C.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>Computer-controlled consumer products are hot right now.andP;  What does that bodefor the PC industry?andM;Item 1: A small company called ETAK in Menlo park, California, makes aspecialized computer that sits in the trunk of your car and uses local areamap information Provided on CD-ROM to show you exactly what wrong alley youturned into.andP;  You can use the device to program where you want to go; itguides you there effortlessly.andP;  It's amazing.andM;Item 2: A strange product called Michel-angelo is hot at Comdex, if you askenough people.andP;  Pieced together out of a variety of components, this thing islike a giant plotter, slowly spraying paint on a large wall to reproducefull-color art or photographic images in precise detail.andM;Item 3: In a recent column, Stephen Manes extolled the virtues of anelaborate sign-making system called the CAMM-1, a fancy computer-controlledstencil cutter that makes the templates for huge signs.andM;Item 4: Panasonic introduces VCRs that incorporate a bar-code reader andadvanced microcomputer logic to help hapless addicts program their machines.andM;Item 5: At a recent grocers' convention, a company shows acomputer-controlled device that scans a photograph and paints the top of acake with food dye to reproduce the photo.andM;Item 6: Except for evolutionary changes in chip technology and feature-ladenupdates of existing software, virtually no innovation has taken place in diedesktop computer arena for the past two years.andM;I'm concerned about Item 6.andP;  Over a year ago, a developer friend of mine saidthat all his buddies-&quot;all the guys with any talent&quot;-are bailing out of thecomputer scene and going into consumer-product design.andM;Already we've seen talking Coke machines, the cellular-phone mania,computerized cash registers, Christmas cards that play music, outrageousVCRS, and programmable ovens.andP;  People who should be buying computers havebeen led instead to &quot;smart&quot; typewriters from Brother, Magnavox, Smith-Corona,and Panasonic.andP;  People who should be programming computers are designingdigital torque wrenches.andM;Meanwhile, even as all die smart guys are vacating the premises, a new cropof Johnny-come-latelies is pouring into the computer business because they'vebeen told that's where the action is.andP;  I've never run into so many peoplesuddenly interested in computers.andP;  What put the bug in their ear?andM;A NEW MEDIUMandM;Today's computer has turned into something like a television; it has become aconduit for programming.andP;  An enormous effort must be expended to keep peopleusing TV.andP;  Twenty-four hours a day, broadcasters must broadcast newer andnewer programs to keep people watching.andP;  People don't need quite as muchimpetus to use computers, but they do need some impetus to stick with thecomputer they use.andP;  If no new software ever came out, what do you think wouldhappen?andM;What would happen if, suddenly, the software scene should stagnate, withnothing new coming on the market except Microsoft Word, Version 17.5;WordPerfect, Version 28; dBASE XIX; and Crosstalk Mk.60? What would happen ifsome other platform came along offering new and better stuff?andM;I think that today's developers are being driven away from computers by theglitches of the 386-VGA scene, with its different BIOS chips, itsvideo-register incompatibilities, and its plethora of irritatingwho-needs-this gotchas.andM;There is a big, clean, unused welcome mat out, waiting for a new standard tocome along.andP;  That standard is in the wings.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
