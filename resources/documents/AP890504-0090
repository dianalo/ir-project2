(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A two-day strike at the University ofCalifornia at Berkeley is aiming for national recognition of aburgeoning movement on the country's campuses to recognize graduateassistants as employees.   ``We do the majority of educating on most major campuses,'' saidLawrence Coates, a 32-year-old classroom assistant who said hebarely survives on a university stipend.   The average student assistant at Berkeley receives about $10,000annually in living expenses for one of the most expensive regionsin the country.   ``We're teaching the bulk of classes; we give out the grades;students come to us with their problems. Is that a teacher or what?But where's the respect for my work?'' Coates asked.   Union representatives claimed hundreds of classes were canceledfor the two-day strike that was concluding today. Universityofficials called the protest largely symbolic, although they didnot check the number of canceled classes.   At the start of the school day Wednesday, placard-carryingdemonstrators greeted students and university workers at majorentrances to campus, handing out yellow armbands and chanting,``Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Union busting's got to go!'' The campusappeared unusually quiet.   Elsewhere around the country, student protests continued overvarious issues:   _About 45 students occupying offices at the University ofMassachusetts in Amherst for the third time in two weeks refused toleave today despite warnings that administrators were preparing toremove them forcibly. They were protesting Pentagon-funded research.   Some 75 students had spent the night in the research building,but 30 left voluntarily this morning. The warning was issued in a45-minute meeting the protesters had with the university's publicsafety director, Arthur Hilson.   _In New York City, some students promised amnesty ended theirsit-ins against proposed tuition increases, while City Universityofficials struggled with an $18 million budget deficit. But otherstudents held fast, saying they would occupy administrationbuildings and offices as long as Gov. Mario Cuomo refuses to meetfor a face-to-face discussion. Cuomo vetoed the tuition hikeTuesday.   _In Ohio, about 50 students held a candlelight vigil early todaymarking the 19th anniversary of the Kent State Universityshootings. Ohio National Guardsmen opened fire on demonstratorsduring an anti-war protest on May 4, 1970, killing four studentsand wounding nine.   _Several hundred students at Middlebury College in Vermont setup pickets outside classrooms and administration buildings today toprotest a planned 11.7 percent fees increase for next year.Tuition, room and board would be raised from $17,000 to $19,000.Betsy Etchells, executive assistant to college President OlinRobison, said the increase was set by trustees and would not bechanged.   _In Atlanta, 40 to 50 Mercer University students, faculty andalumni, hoping to pressure school trustees to keep their College ofArts and Sciences open, ended a 24-hour ``read-in'' this morningand immediately began a 24-hour prayer vigil.   Last month, the trustees, faced with a multimillion-dollardeficit, voted 31-5 to close the liberal arts college in June 1990.The Atlanta campus would continue to house other universityfunctions, including a pharmacy school and a graduate businessschool.   The dispute at Berkeley and many other universities is whetherschools should continue to view classroom and laboratory assistantsas scholars on stipends or employees with a right to collectivebargaining.   University of California teaching assistants handle 58 percentof classroom work involving undergraduate students while researchassistants do about half the laboratory work, according to a studyby the Association for Graduate Student Employees.   The Berkeley-based union of 3,200 graduate assistants,affiliated with the United Auto Workers, is in the vanguard ofstudent-educators nationwide who say they are underpaid, overworkedand often forced to go without health and other benefits. Theassistants also would like to negotiate such issues as class size.   Berkeley spokesman Tom Debley said the university believes thework cannot be considered employment because it is so intertwinedwith educational experience.   During the last decade, major universities in at least fivestates _ Florida, Wisconsin, Michigan, Oregon and New Jersey _ haverecognized graduate assistants as employees.   The debate has cropped up at many more campuses and a victory atBerkeley, one of the nation's most prestigious universities, couldlegitimize graduate students' demands, said David Lambert, anassociation executive board member.   Teaching assistants at the University of Wisconsin in Madisonwon collective bargaining rights from the Legislature in 1985. Nowrepresented by a union affiliated with the American Federation ofTeachers, they are negotiating their second contract.   At the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, the university andits newly organized teaching assistants reached a collectivebargaining agreement earlier this year that gives assistants a 14percent pay raise over the next two years.   The University of Oregon in Eugene rejected graduate students'efforts to unionize in 1975, but the state Employment RelationsBoard ruled in the student's favor in December 1976 and a local wasformed the following year. They have negotiated two-year contractswith the university since then.   At the University of Massachusetts, the coordinating committeeof the teaching assistants union voted last week to affiliate withthe United Auto Workers.   At Berkeley, the union has been seeking recognition since 1983.In a 2-1 ruling last week, the state Public Employment RelationsBoard said that a 1979 law forbids graduate students from beingtreated as employees because their work duties are part ofscholarly training.   The association plans to appeal the decision to a stateappellate court.   Despite the labor board's ruling, legal precedent exists inCalifornia for the students' demands. After losing a court battlethat reached the state Supreme Court, the University of California,San Francisco recently decided to recognize the San FranciscoInterns and Residents Association as a bargaining unit for somegraduate students at its hospital.</TEXT></DOC>
