Sen. Carl Levin (D., Mich.), chairman of a Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee investigating Mr. Meese's financial disclosures, said that a pattern of one-day trading performed by the adviser, W. Franklyn Chinn, showed &quot;numerous occasions&quot; where stock was bought and sold in sums beyond the amount of money Mr. Chinn maintained in two accounts for Mr. Meese.    Mr. Meese in 1985 gave Mr. Chinn more than $50,000 to manage. That would have covered many of the trades. But Mr. Chinn used an account that contained only $10,000 to $15,000 of the money to perform much larger trades that should have been transacted in cash, according to Mr. Levin's subcommittee investigators.    Sen. Levin said his subcommittee is seeking to determine whether the trades violated a Federal Reserve regulation and a Securities and Exchange Commission law. They bar credit for trades in hard-to-get initial public offerings of new stock issues, in which Mr. Chinn specialized in his trades for Mr. Meese's accounts.    Mr. Chinn, who isn't a broker, runs his business out of a residential apartment that has no phone. He recently was sued for fraud by the new management of Wedtech Corp., a Bronx, N.Y., defense contractor that is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law proceedings. Neither he nor his lawyers could be reached for comment on the stock trades.    James Rocap, one of Mr. Meese's lawyers, said he reviewed the monthly statements of the two trading accounts used by Mr. Chinn and saw no violations or indications that margin trades or loans were involved in the transactions. He said apparent gaps between the amount of available money and the amounts of stock bought might be explained by &quot;sequential trades,&quot; but he didn't elaborate.    Sen. Levin's investigators, however, suspect that Mr. Chinn used credit, and substantial clout with a network of brokers across the nation, to get for the attorney general blocks of newly offered stock that were in high demand.    Piecing together monthly statements of the two accounts used by Mr. Chinn to clear the trades, investigators say the investment adviser contacted as many as six or more brokers to get pieces of stock offerings for such hard-to-get stocks as UTS Biotherapeutics and British Airways.    Underwriters and brokers carefully rationed such coveted stocks, which jumped substantially during their first day of trading, among preferred customers. More than 20 same-day trades in similar stocks generated a 20%-to-40% annual rate of increase in Mr. Meese's trust.    Mr. Chinn often used Mr. Meese's two trading accounts, one that contained between $10,000 and $15,000 and the other that fluctuated between $30,000 and $40,000, to buy blocks of stocks whose cash value was substantially larger, according to the subcommittee investigators.    They said the practice appears to violate a section of the SEC law that makes it illegal for new stock issues to be sold on credit. The SEC law is backed by a Fed regulation, Regulation T, that says such trades must be paid for in cash before the stock is resold.    Mr. Chinn's trading for Mr. Meese also is being examined by the federal Office of Government Ethics, which has complained that Mr. Meese's financial disclosure statements for 1985 and 1986 lack information required by law. In May, after two years of dealings with Mr. Chinn, Mr. Meese ended the arrangement because Mr. Chinn had become a subject of investigations involving alleged influence-peddling by Wedtech. </TEXT></DOC>
