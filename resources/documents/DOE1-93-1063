Inthis new design the magnet is composed of permanent magnet segments withmodulated thickness. The magnetization directions of the segments areall perpendicular to the symmetrical plane of the magnet gap. By modulatingthe thicknesses of the segments, the field distribution is a pure sinusoidalcurve in the ideal 2-dimensional case. The spatial expressions of themagnet field in the ideal case and in the real case are given. The methodsfor reducing the undesirable harmonics in the magnet field in the realcase are discussed. Because of the arrangement of the magnetization directionsof the magnet segments, soft iron shield can be used to strenghten themagnet field. In some cases, the stregnthening factor is more than two.The strenghtening effect of the soft iron shield is analysed also. 4refs.; 5 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
