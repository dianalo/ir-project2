It provides a thorough analysis of US ABMTreaty negotiating objectives and outcomes, concluding that the conceptuallinkage between offense and defense established early in SALT was brokenand never reforged in later negotiations or agreements. It examines howSoviet views of strategic defense differ from the US, and how those viewsare reflected in Soviet strategic defense programs. It concludes thatthe Soviet understanding is diametrically opposed to the US view of theABM Treaty, and that this has contributed to the great disparity in strategicdefense effort since the signing of the Treaty. Finally, US BMD programsare examined in detail both to set out a general history of their developmentand to examine specifically the ABM Treaty's effect on that development.US Programs were effected by the ABM Treaty's logic and spirit as muchas they were constrained by specific limitations. The Strategic DefenseInitiative has been similarly hampered by being entangled in the US-Sovietstrategic arms control process. The thesis concludes with a review ofalternative approaches to the ABM Treaty regime.</TEXT></DOC>
