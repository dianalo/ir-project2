It will be kept,'' Rocard told reportersafter the weekly Cabinet meeting.   The last three French hostages held by pro-Iranian MoslemShiites in Lebanon were freed four days before the May 8presidential election, in which Premier Jacques Chirac, aconservative, lost to Socialist President Francois Mitterrand.   Chirac resigned after his defeat, and Mitterrand appointedRocard, also a Socialist, as premier.   Rocard said that the new government found no written record ofthe deal to free diplomats Marcel Carton and Marcel Fontaine andjournalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann.   Media reports speculated that France had made a deal with Iranas a condition for the release, including the payment of a ransom.Chirac had said Iran's intervention on behalf of the captiveFrenchmen would make possible a return to normal diplomaticrelations.   Iran has long said it had influence over groups holding Westernhostages, but told France that improved relations were needed forthe hostages to benefit.   But Chirac's statement about re-establishing ties has been theonly public reference to any possible exchange in return for thehostages.   The hostages, the last Frenchmen held by pro-Iranians, werefreed following lengthy negotiations headed by then-InteriorMinister Charles Pasqua. Pasqua denied any ransom was paid.   Speculation centers on France's repayment to Iran of a $1billion loan for the financing of a nuclear concern, Eurodif.   Rocard said the return to normal relations would create a``better climate'' for commercial negotiations with Iran, such asthe final settlement of the Eurodif debt.   ``My government and the president do not intend to pass judgmenton the conditions under which these negotiations took place,''Rocard said, making an apparent reference to the timing of thereleases, largely construed here as an electoral ploy.   The two countries broke diplomatic ties July 17 in eventsleading up to the last hostage release. Iranian Embassy officialsin Paris refused to let French authorities question Walid Gordji,an embassy translator suspected of involvement with terrorism.Police surrounded the embassy.   In turn, Iranian troops sealed off the French Embassy in Tehran.France said Iran had effectively severed relations.   Gordji was allowed to leave France two days after the return oftwo French in November.   Mitterrand took personal responsibility for the move tore-establish ties, announcing the start of the process at theCabinet meeting, the first regular one since his re-election.   Ten French hostages were freed from Lebanon in the two yearsthat Chirac's government was in power. One hostage, Middle Eastresearcher Michel Seurat, died in capitivity.   Eighteen foreigners, nine of them Americans, were kidnapped inLebanon. The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,1985.</TEXT></DOC>
