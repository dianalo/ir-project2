A morecoherent approach between experiments and even between the larger institutesis advocated. Propagating their methods of the past into the now dominantengineering environment is likely to end in more or less unmanageablesituations. The traditional physicist volunteers must be guided by fewspecially trained and experienced software leaders, who profess an inclinationtowards solid engineering. They should welcome all new hardware developments,but attempt less to translate them into increased CP performance thanto use the offered enhancements in quality of services. Many of theirproblems are also experienced in other fields, but they appear enhancedin their research environment. More contacts amongst themselves, withother scientists, and with industry and Computer Science must be aimedat. 5 figures.</TEXT></DOC>
