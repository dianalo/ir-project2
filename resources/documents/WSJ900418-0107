The battle is being fought on two fronts. Within the partyitself, conservatives appear to have gained the upper handand are openly demanding a purge of the membership. Butfollowing recent local government elections, radicals havetaken control of city halls in Moscow, Leningrad andelsewhere, and are promising to make use of their new powerbase to push through sweeping change. Party authorities inthese cities, long the sole and undisputed rulers, aremounting a rear-guard action to block them.</LP><TEXT>   President Mikhail Gorbachev has frequently said he wantsto hold the party together, at least until a key CommunistCongress in early July. For much of his five years in office,he has successfully played off one side against the other,all the while strengthening his own power.   But as the gap grows wider and ever harder to straddle,the question increasingly is: Whose side is Mr. Gorbachevreally on?   The answer is far from clear. Under Mr. Gorbachev'sleadership, the Central Committee last week published aletter sharply attacking the so-called Democratic Platform, aloose coalition of radicals committed to transforming theCommunist Party into something akin to a Western-stylesocial-democratic group. The letter blasted the DemocraticPlatform's &quot;ideological vacillation and unscrupulousness&quot; andasked: &quot;How can such people remain party members?&quot;   At the same time, Mr. Gorbachev is embracing many of theradicals' proposals, including the establishment of amultiparty democracy and transition to a market economy. Inhis new post as the U.S.S.R.'s elected president, he hasdistanced himself from the party's Politburo and other rulingbodies, preferring to rely on his hand-picked presidentialcouncil of advisers. Last week's decision to step up actionagainst Lithuania, for example, was taken by the council ofadvisers, and not the Politburo.   Lacking an unambiguous signal from the top, the bickeringbetween various factions in the party has grown fiercer. Manybelieve a formal split isn't far off.   &quot;I hoped it would come after the party congress, butfollowing the {Central Committee} letter, I think it will nowtake place beforehand,&quot; says Maxim Sotnikov, a radical whoheads Moscow University's Young Communist League. In theevent of a split, Mr. Gorbachev &quot;already has a way out,&quot; hesays. &quot;He's president.&quot;   Leaders of the Democratic Platform group have so far beenreluctant to leave the Communist Party en masse and set up analternative, even though a handful of their supporters havebeen expelled in recent days by local party organizations.Both publicly and privately, the group's leaders are fudgingtheir next move. Many of them, including Kremlin maverickBoris Yeltsin, are still hoping to play a role in revampingthe party at the July Congress.   While they dither, their colleagues elected to citygovernment have taken up the running. In Moscow, Leningradand several cities in the Ukraine, radicals won a clearmajority during the local elections in March and have startedto form governing bodies.   It is rarely straightforward.   In both Moscow and Leningrad, the local Communist Partyhas taken control of the newspapers it originally shared withthe governing councils and is claiming exclusive use ofdozens of buildings. &quot;They were paid for out of party funds,&quot;said Moscow's Communist leader, Yuri Prokofiev, explainingwhy the party is insisting on its ownership of more than 30buildings in the Soviet capital.   In the Western Ukraine, where nationalists won a landslidevictory in the elections, stern warnings seem to be the onlyremaining weapon for conservatives. The Ukrainian CommunistParty yesterday slammed the newly elected deputies, many ofwhom aren't Communists, accusing them of seeking to &quot;furthertheir own ambitions.&quot; It warned that &quot;resolute measures willbe taken to strictly implement&quot; Soviet law, but didn'telaborate.   The battle is fiercest in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital,where radicals failed to win a clear majority of seats.Kiev's governing council has been deadlocked for days overwhom to elect as chairman. The local Communist Party leaderis standing for the post, so far without success. Butradicals also lack a handful of votes to push through theircandidates, according to Yuri Shcherbak, a Ukrainian activistwho is a deputy in the Soviet parliament.   The struggle in Kiev and elsewhere is fierce because &quot;theparty apparat have understood that if they lose, they'll bewithout a future,&quot; Mr. Shcherbak says.   Judging by the opening sessions of the Moscow citycouncil, Soviet politics is entering an extremely turbulentperiod. Radicals in the Soviet capital are seeking to haveGavriil Popov, a leading economist who edits a high-mindedeconomics journal, elected as mayor. But after two days offierce discussions on procedural and other issues, thecouncil has yet to get beyond preliminary items on theagenda. They include whether to stop serving sturgeon at thecanteen and whether to remove the huge white bust of Leninstanding behind the podium. (Neither issue has so far beenconclusively decided.)   Meanwhile, Mr. Popov, a soft-spoken man with gray hair anda broad smile, is under fierce attack by the Sovietconservative press. Two papers, Literaturnaya Rossiya andSovietskaya Rossiya, both ran long profiles last weekportraying him an elitist hypocrite and opportunist. Mr.Popov shrugs off the attacks as reminiscent of old-styleSoviet journalism.   Arguments erupt at every step. When the radicals approveda mild declaration on Monday supporting two publicprosecutors who have investigated high-level corruption andwho are currently under government investigation for abuse ofpower, conservative Communist deputies in the council walkedout. Some of them walked out again yesterday when the sessionsanctioned a rally by the Kremlin walls in support of theprosecutors, Telman Gdlyan and Nikolai Ivanov.   The council's conservative executive committee, whichserves as a caretaker administration until a new committee iselected, suggested holding the rally next week in a Moscowpark, but was overruled. In the end, several thousand peoplegathered for the lunchtime demonstration, timed to coincidewith a debate on the two prosecutors in the nationalparliament. The crowd, clearly siding with the radicals,shouted and waved slogans such as &quot;Shame on the CentralCommittee&quot; and &quot;Party Mafia-Resign.&quot;   &quot;This is a simple struggle between reactionaries anddemocrats,&quot; one speaker told the crowd. &quot;For 72 years we havebeen governed by criminals.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
