The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration proposed $379,900 in penalties against Power Battery Co., which was cited for 59 alleged violations, 44 of them &quot;willful.&quot; A willful violation is one in which a company knew it was violating the standard and didn't make a reasonable effort to correct it.    The agency proposed $169,200 in fines against Atlantic Battery Co., a unit that it said committed 35 violations, including 23 willful ones.    OSHA alleged that 11 of 13 workers sampled at Power and five of 13 at Atlantic were exposed to excessive lead levels. OSHA requires employers to limit airborne exposure to 50 micrograms of lead per cubic meter of air.    In addition, the agency said, the companies didn't conduct routine inspections and testing of respirators, with the result that several workers used respirators with defective valves. OSHA also said, among other things, that neither company monitored air lead levels as frequently as required or gave required physical examinations.    The companies were given 15 work days to contest the findings and penalties before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. </TEXT></DOC>
