(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two women have been charged with lining uptheir six children in the home they shared and allowing men to taketheir pick for sex, police said.   Annette Sanford, 34, of South Haven, was charged last week withfour counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. CarolynWilson, 42, of Bangor, was charged with one count of first-degreechild abuse and four counts of criminal sexual conduct. They arenot accused of sexually abusing the children themselves.   Investigators say they believe at least seven men visited thewomen's house frequently in 1987 and 1988 to choose their victimsfrom the line-up. They said the children were then sexuallyassaulted in their bedrooms.   ``The kids would just look at each other as if to say `Oh God,not again,''' Detective Patrick O'Reilly said.   The women have denied the allegations, police said.   The women, who are not related, were living together in OtsegoTownship, about 30 miles south of Grand Rapids, and each had threechildren in the house. Sheriff's Lt. Rick Cain said today that thesix children have a number of different last names, and authoritieshave been unable to determine who their biological fathers are. Hesaid the women have been uncooperative in background checks on themor the children.   The children, five girls and one boy, have been living in fosterhomes since May 1988, after one of the girls came to school withbruises and told school officials of the alleged abuse. Five of thechildren are 8 to 13 years old; the sixth is a developmentallydisabled 18-year-old girl.   After interviewing the girl at school, Cain said he petitionedthe Allegan County Probate Court to have the children removed.   Police didn't seek arrest warrants for the women until two weeksago, when they believed the children were prepared to testify. ``Wedidn't feel a year ago they were prepared to testify or couldtestify,'' Cain said.   Police said the line-ups occurred at least once a week for atleast a year. The women also allegedly beat the children and forcedthem to clean floors with toothbrushes and eat dog food, policesaid.   Authorities were investigating motives for the alleged crimes.``The assumption would be money or narcotics changed hands,'' Cainsaid.   There is medical evidence to substantiate the children's claimsof sexual abuse, police said. Two of the girls were believed tohave been spared, they added.   One man, Robert Sterling of Muskegon, has been charged withsecond-degree criminal sexual conduct, and police are seekingothers.   ``They'd select their child and go into a room to have sex. Thekids' stories are consistent and corroborate each other,'' Cainsaid.   The women were being held in the Allegan County jail, Sanford on$10,000 bond and Wilson on $12,500 bond. A hearing is scheduledTuesday in circuit court.</TEXT></DOC>
