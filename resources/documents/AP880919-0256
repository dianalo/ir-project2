The Petroleum Intelligence Weekly said Saudi Arabia is exceedingits quota in an effort to challenge other quota violators to stopoverproduction. The newsletter said the Saudis are expected tooffer to return to their quota only when other OPEC members do so.   Meanwhile, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman said the organization'sfive-member price committee will meet either on the Indonesianisland of Bali or in Vienna on Sept. 25 and 26.   Lukman, speaking on his arrival at the site of the Asia-PacificPetroleum Conference, declined to be specific, telling reporters,``Why don't you ask Subroto?''   OPEC Secretary General Subroto currently is in the Austriancapital.   Although the price committee can't make pricing adjustments, ithas the authority to call a full meeting of all 13 members of OPEC.   Oil prices rose last week when the meeting was announced,reflecting the market's optimism that such a gathering could meanthat the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries wasinterested in restraining output and raising world oil prices.   Prices eased late in the week, however, partly in response to astatement from Iraq that it would not go along with an OPEC-imposedquota.   Iraq, as well as other OPEC countries, have been exceeding theirquotas, dumping more than a million barrels of oil a day more thanthe market can absorb, according to some analysts.   Last week, the Saudis announced special discounts to somecountries, leading some analysts to speculate that OPEC's largestproducer had given up its quota in favor of competing for marketshare.   The weekly newsletter said the Saudis had violated their4.35-million-barrel-a-day quota in order to influence the Sept. 25meeting, but did not say by how much.   Saudi Arabia is expected to formally confirm its supplyviolation to fellow committee members, the newsletter said.   Lukman, meanwhile, took issue with the Saudi report, sayingexceeding quotas was not the way to solve the oversupply problem.Lukman also said reports that OPEC's production had reached 20million barrels a day were exaggerated. He declined to say how muchthe cartel is producing.   Lukman also said unilateral efforts by OPEC to shore up the oilmarket through production quotas in the face of excess world supplyallowed other producers to take a more than two-thirds share ofglobal production.   This, he said, ``sowed the seeds of the oil market crisis of1986.''   Lukman said he would be meeting with representatives of non-OPECcountries attending the APPEC sessions regarding the shaky crudeoil market.   Non-OPEC oil producers at APPEC include Egypt, Malaysia, andOman. Lukman declined to comment on the nature or extent of themeetings.</TEXT></DOC>
