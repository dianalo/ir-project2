Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>This rule contains information collection requirements subject to the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.Section 7.63 requires applicants seeking approval of multiple-shot blastingunits to submit an application for approval. MSHA estimates there willbe 1.1 applications for approval or extension of approval per year, eachrequiring 4 hours to prepare. At an estimated cost of $37 per hour, 1.1applications would require 4.4 hours and cost $163. The application feeof $100 being charged under the revised fee schedule is applied towardthe cost of processing the application, and therefore is not included asa cost of the application.Under this rule, part 7, subpart A, andSection; 7.4(a) requires records oftest results and procedures to be retained for at least three years. Standardtesting protocols used by the manufacturing community include the keepingof records of product testing. Therefore, MSHA estimates there will beno additional cost for applicants to maintain these records.Under this rule, part 7, subpart A, andSection; 7.5(d) requires applicantsto report to MSHA any knowledge of a product distributed with criticalcharacteristics not in accordance with the approval specifications. Rarelywould such a report be submitted; however, for the purpose of this analysis,based on a worst-case scenario, MSHA estimates an annual cost of $37 or15 minutes per manufacturer.The rule requires applicants to maintain records on the distribution ofeach blasting unit bearing an approval marking as set forth in part 7,subpart A, andSection; 7.7(c). This provision does not specify the type ofrecord, and MSHA believes applicants will use existing sales record systemsto comply. Therefore, MSHA has assigned no cost to this requirement.Section 7.71 requires the applicant to include an approval checklist witheach blasting unit bearing an approval marking. MSHA estimates that itwill require two hours to develop the checklist. At $37 an hour, the one-timecost is $74 for each manufacturer, or $296 total. MSHA has also investigatedthe cost of inserting the checklist with each blasting unit and has determinedthat the cost is minimal. It takes only a few seconds to insert the checklist,and only about 544 blasting units are sold annually.In accordance with andSection; 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of1980, the collection of information requirements contained in andSection;andSection;7.63 and 7.71 of the final rule have been approved by OMB under controlnumber 1219-0100.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>This final rule will replace, in one year, the current regulations coveringthe testing and approval of multiple-shot blasting units found in 30 CFRpart 25. These revisions are issued pursuant to section 508 of the FederalMine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 957).On June 5, 1984, MSHA published a notice of availability of its preproposaldraft revisions concerning approval requirements for blasting units, 30CFR part 25, and scheduled a public conference (49 FR 23281). The publicconference, held July 11, 1984, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was well attendedby representatives of the mining community. MSHA also received writtencomments from manufacturers of blasting units and other segments of themining community.After reviewing the comments received in response to the preproposal draft,MSHA published a proposed rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on June 22, 1988 (53 FR 23506). The proposaldid not retain the existing procedures for MSHA testing of multiple-shotblasting units submitted for approval under part 25. Instead, it proposedthat blasting units be tested by the applicant or a third party selectedby the applicant under the provisions of 30 CFR part 7, Underground MiningEquipment; Product Testing by Applicant or Third Party. Technical requirementsand test procedures for blasting unit approval were proposed as subpartD to part 7.MSHA reviewed all written statements submitted in response to the proposedrule. No public hearing was requested or held on subpart D. Comments werereceived from all segments of the mining community including equipmentmanufacturers, trade associations, and representatives of miners. Thisfinal rule was developed after a full evaluation of the entire public record.The Agency's final rule addresses the comments received and is consistentwith Executive Order 12291, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and the PaperworkReduction Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Discussion and Summary of the Final Rule</ITAG>A. General discussionMSHA's regulations found in 30 CFR part 25 governing the approval of blastingunits were last revised in 1960. Since that time, technological advancesin electronic components and circuitry have led to the development of improvedblasting units suitable for use in underground mines having potentiallyexplosive atmospheres.Under this final rule, multiple-shot blasting units will be evaluated forapproval under MSHA's new part 7 and subject to general provisions locatedin subpart A of that part. Blasting units meet the criteria for applicantor third party testing because they are a product possessing characteristicsthat can be objectively tested in a routine and readily reproducible mannerwithout subjective analysis.Part 7 revises MSHA's role in the evaluation and testing of selected productsused in underground mines. Products approved under part 7 are requiredto be tested by the applicant or by a third party selected by the applicantto conduct the testing. All testing is to be conducted using MSHA-specifiedtest procedures with certification of test results by the applicant. Inaddition, the Agency has the right to observe all product testing. Whenrequesting approval, the applicant is required to submit certain productinformation. This includes, for example, drawings and specifications todocument compliance with the technical requirements. Based upon an evaluationof the technical documentation, any MSHA observations of product testing,and a review of the certification statements, MSHA will issue an approvalor notice denying approval of the product.Once a product is approved under part 7, an approval-holder is requiredto inspect or test critical characteristics of the product as part of itsquality assurance program. MSHA will perform periodic audits of productsapproved under part 7 to ensure that they are being manufactured as approved.If a product fails to meet the technical requirements of the applicablesubpart of part 7 or creates a hazard related to its use, MSHA will takeimmediate action to address the problem including revocation of the approvalif necessary.As subpart D to part 7, this rule specifies the technical requirementsand test procedures for the approval of multiple-shot blasting units. Itrevises part 25 through improved, more up-to-date requirements, replacingsubjective technical requirements with performance-oriented tests and introducingcharts which specify maximum electrical values. These changes when comparedto part 25, will provide better safety to miners. The tests are based onMSHA's engineering experience with the subjective criteria of approvalrequirements. Except where indicated, they are not intended to introducemore stringent testing methods, but rather to explicitly state the testsused in MSHA's current testing program which have proven to be effective.This rule provides objective criteria for applicant or third party testing.By using these test procedures, manufacturers can measure and evaluatetheir product with the performance portion of the technical requirementsof this subpart in order to receive an MSHA approval.The rule deletes requirements for generator-powered blasting unit designswhich are no longer used in underground mines. Also deleted are the part25 classifications referred to as 10- and 20-shot blasting units. The capacityof blasting units under the final rule is indicated by the maximum blastingcircuit resistance displayed on the blasting unit label.Section 25.9, which concerned observers at test and evaluations, is nowaddressed by the general product testing requirements in andSection; 7.4in subpart A of part 7. Similarly, revocation of blasting unit approvalis governed by the provisions of andSection; 7.9 located in subpart A ofthis part.A commenter suggested adding a new section to the final rule to requirethat MSHA maintain a list of approved blasting units which would be availableto the public. Lists of approved products are maintained by MSHA and areavailable to the public. This is not an issue that needs to be addressedby rulemaking.New requirements and test procedures for the energy output of blastingunits are contained in the final rule. Although these requirements aremore stringent than the existing requirements, they address state-of-the-artdesign technology already incorporated in most blasting units currentlyapproved for use. These requirements address potential hazards where NSHAbelieves that the incorporation of advanced technology improves safety.There are three elements present in an electric blasting system: the explosive,the electric detonator, and the blasting unit. Degraded performance ormalfunction of any one of these elements has the potential to cause incompleteor premature detonation and lead to a blasting accident. The Agency hasbased this rule on its field experience, testing under the existing approvalstandards, developmental research and the availability of improved technology.B. Section-by-Section DiscussionThe following section-by-section analysis discusses each provision of subpartD and addresses the comments received on the proposed rule.Section 7.61 Purpose and effective date.This section, derived from andSection; 25.1, revises and simplifies the statementof purpose and requires that multiple-shot blasting units be approved underpart 7. It applies to blasting units used underground in both coal minesand certain metal and nonmetal mines, as defined in subpart T of 30 CFRpart 57, where MSHA approved blasting units are required (52 FR 24924,July 1, 1987; 52 FR 41394, October 27, 1987).One commenter expressed concern and requested assurance that the requirementscontained in 30 CFR part 57.22606 pertaining to blasting units used incertain metal and nonmetal mines to fire more than 20 detonators, wouldnot change subsequent to the promulgation of subpart D. As indicated inthe preamble discussion in the final rule on methane standards (52 FR 24924July 1, 1987), some changes to andSection; 54.22606 are necessary based onthe revised technical specifications for approval of multiple-shot blastingunits which allow for the approval of units capable of firing more than20 shots. The Agency is currently considering certain conforming amendmentsto andSection; 57.22606 resulting from the approval requirements in thissubpart D final rule. Amendments to part 57 will be proposed in a futurerulemaking and therefore subject to public comment.Section 7.61 provides that the requirements of subpart D take effect 60days after publication. It further provides that manufacturers may requestapproval or extension of approval of blasting units under part 25 untilone year from the effective date of subpart D. After the one-year period,part 25 will be removed and all new applications for approval or extensionof approval of blasting units will be evaluated under the provisions ofsubpart D of this part.This phase-in period of one year will enable manufacturers and third-partylaboratories to make arrangements to conduct the necessary blasting unittesting. During this period, both part 25 and subpart D will be in effect.Applicants can, therefore, choose to submit applications for approval underpart 25 and have the blasting units tested by MSHA or under subpart D wherethe obligation to test will be with the applicant. Applicants must submitextensions of approval in accordance with the approval regulations underwhich the original approval was granted.After the one-year phase-in period for this subpart and the removal ofpart 25, approvals for blasting units will be granted only under subpartD. At the expiration of the one year, all applications for extensions ofapproval of blasting units approved under part 25 will be treated as newapplications, and applicants will be required to apply for an originalapproval under subpart D. MSHA will not revoke, except for cause, any blastingunit approvals previously granted. Blasting units approved under priorregulations and in compliance with those regulations, may continue to bemanufactured as long as no changes are made which would deviate from conformancewith the approval documentation. MSHA will audit these blasting units basedupon the technical requirements upon which the approval was issued.Section 7.62 Definitions.The following definitions applying to the approval of blasting units arenew with the exception of the term ``blasting unit'' which is derived fromandSection; 25.2. They are designed to clarify the requirements of subpartD and respond to the issues identified by commenters.<T3>Blasting circuit. </T3>This term identifies the items connected tothe firing line terminals of the blasting unit. It is necessary to identifythese items in order to determine the electrical parameters used in theacceptable performance section of the output energy test.<T3>Blasting unit. </T3>This term essentially retains the definition givenin part 25 but clarifies that the requirements of this subpart apply onlyto electric initiating systems which are the only types permitted in undergroundcoal and gassy metal and nonmetal mines under MSHA's explosives and blastingsafety standards.<T3>Normal operation. </T3>This term specifies the electrical parametersto be used by the applicant to determine if the maximum power, voltage,current and temperature attainable under these conditions are in compliancewith andSection; 7.64 (f), (g), and (h).One commenter on the proposed rule suggested retaining the preproposaldraft's separate definitions for multiple-shot and large capacity blastingunits, with the technical requirements for each separately identified.This, the commenter believed, would prevent misunderstanding and the potentialfor blasting units being used inappropriately for the specific mine application.This suggestion has not been adopted because the preproposal designationof a large capacity blasting unit was not intended to limit the use ofsuch a unit to firing more than 20 shots. Instead, it was intended to designatethose units which perform in all other respects like the multiple-shotunit but which would have additional capacity. The final rule requiresthat the maximum blasting circuit resistance for an approved blasting unitbe at least 150 ohms which is equivalent to the capacity of the 20-shotunit defined in part 25. Therefore, when used with detonators of the typecommonly used in underground mines today, blasting units approved underthis subpart will have sufficient capacity to fire at least 20 shots. Further,all blasting units approved under this final rule, including those withgreater capacity than 20 shots, may be used to safely fire from 1 to 20shots. The applicable provisions of part 75 for underground coal minesand part 57 for underground gassy metal and nonmetal mines regulate theuse of those blasting units approved under the final rule with the capacityto fire more than 20 shots. All blasting units approved under this subpartare required to have an approval marking identifying their capacity interms of maximum blasting circuit resistance. This information will enablemine operators to determine the number of shots which can be safely firedwith each blasting unit.The same commenter urged that subpart D include a definition of ``manufacturingsite survey'' as it appeared in the preproposal draft of part 25 and thatMSHA conduct such surveys of applicants' manufacturing facilities. Duringrulemaking on the general provisions of subpart A of this part, MSHA determinedthat its resources are more appropriately used to evaluate approved productsbeing distributed to underground mines rather than to evaluate an applicant'smanufacturing site. Since this term is not used in part 7, no definitionof ``manufacturing site survey'' has been added to subpart D.A recommendation was also received to include a definition of ``permissible''in subpart D. The term ``permissible,'' used in part 25 and also in thepreproposal to describe blasting units which have been approved by MSHA,has been replaced with the term a ``approved.'' The terminology used toidentify products which have been examined by the Agency to determine conformitywith regulatory requirements must be standardized. The term which mostappropriately reflects MSHA's action in this area is ``approved.'' Therefore,the phrase ``approved blasting unit'' is used in subpart D of part 7 inlieu of ``permissible blasting unit.'' However, since blasting units approvedas permissible under part 25 may continue to be manufactured and used inunderground mines requiring approved blasting units, the safety standardin part 75 defines the term ``permissible blasting unit'' as one approvedby MSHA.General definitions such as ``applicant,'' ``approval,'' and ``post-approvalproduct audit'' which were contained in part 25 are not included in thissubpart. They are defined in the general provisions of subpart A of part7.The following definitions, which appeared in part 25 or the preproposaldraft, are not retained in the final rule. The acronyms ``MESA'' and ``MSHA''are not defined since these terms are defined in 30 CFR part 1. The terms``permissible,'' ``short-delay electric detonator,'' and ``manufacturingsite surveys'' are not used and therefore are not defined.Section 7.63 Application requirements.Paragraph (a), derived from andSection; 25.6(c), prescribes the documentationto be submitted with each multiple-shot blasting unit approval application.The required drawings and specifications are to demonstrate compliancewith the rule and to identify the blasting unit.A commenter recommended adding language to andSection; 7.63(a) requiringthat all applications for approval of blasting units be submitted in English.Current MSHA policy is to accept for approval evaluation only those applicationssubmitted in English. The Agency has not experienced problems with thispolicy and therefore has not included this requirement in andSection; 7.63(a).The overall assembly drawing is one that describes pictorially how theunit is assembled, its physical dimensions, and the location of major subassemblies.The requirement for a schematic diagram and parts list demonstrates compliancewith the electrical performance requirements of this subpart. The componentlayout drawing is to demonstrate compliance with the technical requirementsof andSection; 7.64 and will facilitate conducting post-approval audits ofthe blasting unit. Applicants may submit drawings specifically preparedfor approval applications or may submit the actual drawings used in theassembly of the blasting unit. In either case, the drawings are requiredto represent the blasting unit exactly as it will be manufactured.The Agency agrees with a commenter who suggested that the application forapproval include the model number or other manufacturer's designation ofthe blasting unit in order to avoid confusion with similar products andto promote easier identification. Section 7.63(a)(5) has been added tothe final rule to require applicants to submit this information with theirapplication.Paragraph (b) is derived from andSection; 25.6(c) and requires that eachdrawing be titled, numbered, dated, and include the latest revision. Thisparagraph permits drawings to be combined into one or more composite drawingswhich would reduce the number of drawings that must be maintained bothby the applicant and by MSHA. An example of a composite drawing is a partslist printed on a schematic diagram. All drawings that are required bythis subpart could be combined into a single composite drawing.Paragraph (c), which is new, requires applications for approval to containa list of the drawings submitted. This list must include drawing titles,numbers, and revisions.Paragraph (d) is derived from andSection; 25.6(a). It requires that a descriptionof the operation and use of the blasting unit be submitted with the application.Use instructions are necessary to establish the conditions under whichthe normal operation of the blasting unit is determined.<ITAG tagnum="81">Fees</ITAG>In accordance with 30 CFR part 5, Fees for Testing Evaluation and Approvalof Mining Products, fees for MSHA processing of an application under part7, subpart A will be subject to an hourly charge. Fee schedules are updatedat least once every three years and published in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4>The Agency will charge $35 per hour and an application fee of $100 forprocessing requests for approval or extension of approval for multiple-shotblasting units under subpart D of part 7.Section 7.64 Technical requirements.This section revises and updates the technical requirements for the approvalof blasting units.Paragraph (a) is derived from andSection; 25.7 (g), (h), and (i) and specifiesthat blasting units meet the acceptable performance criteria of the outputenergy test in andSection; 7.66. The acceptable performance criteria of thattest increases the minimum firing current from an average current of 1.5amperes, specified in part 25, to 2 amperes under this final rule. In addition,it decreases the voltage cut-off time from a maximum of 15 milliseconds,as required in part 25, to 10 milliseconds. Increasing the current fromthe blasting unit reduces the likelihood of misfires in the blasting circuit.Decreasing the maximum allowable time for voltage cut off reduces the likelihoodthat an incendive spark, created by the post-firing contact of wires inthe blasting circuit, could ignite an explosive methane-air atmosphere.The acceptable performance criteria of the output energy test have beendeveloped for approved blasting units to maintain compatibility with andreliably initiate electric detonators of the type currently used in gassyunderground mines in the United States. This type electric detonator typicallyfires when an average current of 1.5 amperes is applied to the detonatorfor 5 milliseconds, does not misfire when up to an average of 100 amperesis applied to the detonator for 10 milliseconds, and has an electricalresistance less than 7 ohms.Blasting units approved under part 25 can fire up to a maximum of 20 shots.Subpart D does not limit the number of shots a blasting unit can be designedto fire. The capacity of the blasting unit is determined by the maximumblasting circuit resistance as specified by the applicant. This final ruleallows units capable of firing more than 20 shots to be approved.Under paragraph (b), which is derived from andSection; 25.25, the maximumblasting circuit resistance of a blasting unit is the highest value ofresistance that can be connected to the firing line terminals of a blastingunit without exceeding its capacity. When a blasting unit is connectedto a blasting circuit having a resistance that exceeds the unit's capacity,all detonators may not fire. This could result in dangerous conditionssuch as partially detonated rounds of explosives or erratic timing resultingin blown-out shots.The final rule requires applicants for approval to specify the maximumvalue of blasting circuit resistance of their blasting units. However,only units with a maximum blasting circuit resistance capacity of at least150 ohms will be approved. This aspect of the rule is derived from andSection;25.25, which requires that blasting units be capable of firing 20 electricdetonators connected in a single series with a total resistance of 150ohms. This requirement that the maximum firing resistance be at least 150ohms ensures that blasting units approved under this subpart have at leastthe same energy output as blasting units approved under part 25.The footnote included in the preamble of the proposed rule has been deleted.The footnote was a formula to calculate the maximum number of detonatorsthat can be fired by a blasting unit. One commenter said the calculationimplied that the number of detonators in the blasting circuit could exceedthe recommendations of the detonator manufacturer. The purpose served bythe footnote was to show the relationship of the maximum blasting circuitresistance to the number of detonators in the blasting circuit and notto determine the number of detonators to be used. The Agency recommendsthat the number of detonators connected in the blasting circuit not exceedthe detonator manufacturer's recommendation.Paragraph (c), derived from andSection; 25.7(f), requires that a blastingunit have a visual indicator to alert the user when the unit is ready tobe operated. In a typical blasting unit design, the visual indicator isactivated when the unit's energy storage capacitors have been charged tothe voltage necessary to produce the required firing current through theblasting circuit. The unit may not be capable of providing energy to theblasting circuit sufficient to initiate all the detonators prior to thistime. Under andSection; 7.64(h), the lamp used to visually indicate readinesscannot be an incandescent lamp or other type of lamp having a temperaturegreater than 302 anddegrees;F (150 anddegrees;C) because of methane gas andcoal dust ignition hazards.The majority of commenters on the proposed rule disagreed with MSHA's proposedandSection; 7.64 (c)(2) and (d)(3) which required a high resistance circuitindicator and interlock of the firing switch of blasting units. These requirementswere included in the proposed rule in response to a comment on the part25 preproposal requesting additional safeguards to protect against firinginto high resistance blasting circuits. The incorporation of an integralblaster's ohmmeter into the design of the blasting unit was suggested.Blasting units approved under part 25 have incorporated this feature withno safety problems resulting from its use.The Agency, in response to this concern, incorporated these features intothe proposed rule to address the hazard of misfires resulting from firinginto blasting circuits exceeding the capacity of the blasting unit. Onecommenter stated that these proposed features would be an unnecessary complicationof questionable value. Another commenter believed that the introductionof an additional current would create a potential hazard in that an electricalcomponent fault in this circuit could result in detonation of the roundwhen the blasting unit user is intending to check the resistance of theblasting circuit. Another commenter suggested that the interlock couldbe easily defeated and yet another stated that a blasting unit could beused in place of a blaster's galvanometer to determine the blasting circuitresistance.The final rule deletes the proposed requirements in (c)(2) and (d)(3) thata high resistance indicator and interlock of the firing switch be includedin approved blasting units. Recent rulemaking in the explosives and blastingsafety standards requires that the resistance of the blasting circuit bemeasured by an appropriate device immediately prior to connecting the blastingcircuit to the blasting unit. As a result of this rulemaking, the Agency'sconcern regarding the resistance of the blasting circuit has been addressed.Accordingly, the requirement for resistance verification and interlockingcircuitry is not included in the final rule.Paragraph (d) requires two safety features for the firing switch of blastingunits. These requirements are derived from andSection;andSection; 25.7(e) and25.8(b)(3) and 25.7(f), respectively. First, the firing switch is requiredto operate by a deliberate action to prevent accidental firing. Recessingthe switch in the blasting unit enclosure or protecting it with a raisedguard are examples of switches which require a deliberate action. The othersafety feature for the firing switch is that it not be operable when thevoltage necessary to produce the required firing current is not availableto the blasting circuit. The firing switch may be made inoperable by eithermechanical or electrical means.Paragraph (e)(1) is new and requires that the blasting unit firing lineterminals provide a secure, low resistance connection to the blasting circuitas measured by the firing line terminals test in andSection; 7.68. Althoughthis requirement is new, it does not introduce a more stringent requirementthan previously existed. Paragraph 7.64(e)(1) introduces minimum performancerequirements to clarify ambigous language such as ``suitable materials''and ``sound engineering principles'' in andSection; 25.7(a) and ``adequacyof design and construction,'' ``practically in operation'' and ``suitabilityfor underground service'' in andSection; 25.7(c). Performance requirementsin andSection; 7.68 provide that the contact resistance through each firingline terminal not exceed 1 ohm. Poor electrical connections to the firingline terminals can create additional blasting circuit resistance and increasethe risk of misfires.One commenter on the proposed rule suggested that, in addition to statingthe requirements for maximum contact resistance, the internal resistanceof the blasting unit also be addressed. The internal resistance limitsthe electric current that is available at the firing line terminals. Thisis an important parameter in the performance of the blasting unit. It isaddressed by test and documentation requirements in the final rule. Theperformance-oriented output energy test of andSection; 7.66 determines ifsufficient electric current is available at the firing line terminals,within the specified capacity of the blasting unit. The parts list andschematic diagram, to be submitted by the applicant under andSection; 7.63(a)(3) and (4), document the values of internal components used in the blastingunit. This information documents the designed internal resistance of theblasting unit.Under paragraph (e)(2), which is derived from andSection; 25.7(c), the firingline terminals must be constructed of corrosion-resistant material, suchas nickel or chromium-plated copper. Blasting units are exposed to corrosiveagents in underground mines which could cause deterioration of metal inthe firing terminals. This condition could result in a high resistanceconnection to the blasting circuit and contribute to the risk of misfires.Paragraphs (e)(3) and (e)(4) address the need for insulation on and aroundthe firing line terminals and are derived from andSection; 25.7(k). Paragraph(e)(3) requires that the firing line terminals be insulated so that nometal conductors are exposed. This protects the user from electric shock.Examples of well-insulated firing line terminals include binding postswhich are covered with plastic or rubber and connectors recessed into aninsulated blasting unit enclosure. Paragraph (e)(4) requires that an insulatedbarrier separate the firing line terminals of a blasting unit to preventthe uninsulated ends of the blasting cables from contacting each otherwhen connected to the unit.Paragraph (f) requires that in the normal operation of the blasting unit,no electric components, other than the batteries, be operated at more than90 percent of their electrical ratings. It is derived from andSection;andSection;25.7(c) and 25.8(b)(1). Electric components operated at less than theirpower rating reduce the likelihood of component failure which could renderthe blasting units unsafe.Paragraph (g) and (h) are derived from andSection; 25.7 (d) and (c), respectively.They address the hazard of blasting units releasing sufficient electricor thermal energy to cause a methane ignition or fire. Blasting units,having the capacity necessary to reliably fire electric detonators, generateincentive energy that can cause such an ignition and may have componentsthat operate at temperatures sufficient to ignite coal dust. These requirementsare evaluated in the ``normal operation'' of the blasting unit as definedin andSection; 7.62.Paragraph (g) retains the existing requirement that blasting units be incapableof igniting an explosive mixture of methane and air when electric energyis released by making and breaking moveable electric contacts in the unit.Although the energy stored within the blasting unit is capable of ignitingexplosive gas mixtures, this energy is not to be released, under normalconditions, at operating electric contacts. To determine compliance withthis requirement, the rule provides electric current and voltage limitations.These limitations are described by curves which relate electric currentand voltage to that amount which will ignite an explosive mixture of methaneand air. The curves appear as Figures D-1, D-2, and D-3. The curves addressthe electric current through an electric contact that interrupts a circuitnot containing an inductive component, the voltage applied across an electriccontact that discharges a capacitor, and the electric current through anelectric contact that interrupts a circuit containing an inductive component.MSHA's Approval and Certification Center has developed these specificationsfrom industry accepted minimum ignition curves for methane-air mixturesused by consensus standards. The Center's curves include a safety factorand have been utilized for a number of years in evaluating electric circuits.The specifications provide an objective basis upon which the applicantcan determine whether or not the blasting unit is capable of causing ignitionof an explosive methane atmosphere.Paragraph (h) addresses the risk of fire caused by blasting units and requiresthat the maximum temperature of any electric component during normal operationnot exceed 302 anddegrees;F (150 anddegrees;C). This is the maximum surfacetemperature allowed by 30 CFR 18.23 for electric equipment approved byMSHA and is the minimum ignition temperature of a coal dust layer. Combustiblecoal dust on heat-producing electric components can cause a fire. Compliancewith this requirement can be determined by using a pyrometer or similardevice to detect ``hot spots'' in blasting units and by measuring the temperatureof components with a thermocouple or similar device. A commenter expressedconcern that an incandescent bulb can ignite a methane-air atmosphere.The maximum temperature restriction of paragraph (h) prohibits the useof incandescent lamps.Paragraph (i) is derived from andSection;25.8(b)(2). It requires that blastingunits be equipped with an automatic means to dissipate any electric chargeremaining in any capacitor after the blasting unit is deenergized and notin use. Dissipating the electric charge in the capacitors in blasting unitsreduces the risk of causing an ignition in a methane-air atmosphere.Under paragraph (j), blasting units must meet the acceptable performancecriteria of the construction test in andSection;7.67. This requirement isderived from andSection;25.7 (c) and (m). The enclosure of a blasting unitneeds to be substantially constructed to prevent dust and moisture frombeing deposited on the electric circuits. Water and corrosive dusts cancause an internal short circuit, which can result in a fire or blastingunit malfunction. Details of these criteria are described in the explanationof that test.Paragraph (k) requires that blasting units be equipped with a locking deviceto prevent unauthorized use and is derived from andSection;25.7(e). A devicesuch as a key-operated firing switch, lockable cover, a padlock, or a removablefiring pin over the firing switch meets the requirements of this paragraph.Paragraph (l) is derived from andSection;25.7(m) and 25.8 (b)(4). It retainsthe requirements that blasting units be sealed to prevent tampering aswell as designed and constructed to enable battery replacement withoutdisturbing or damaging other electric components. The rule allows two alternativemethods of compliance. Blasting unit enclosures, except for batteries,could be permanently sealed, for example, by continuous welding aroundthe enclosure so that the unit would be destroyed if entered. Alternatively,the electric components could be sealed in a solidified insulating material,such as an epoxy. With this option, the rule requires that the enclosurebe assembled with tamper-resistant hardware so that it could be openedonly with special tools. Either method provides protection against tampering,such as substitution of inadequate electric components or improper adjustmentof potentiometer settings in a blasting unit that may adversely affectits timing or energy output. Such changes in performance could lead tomisfires or potential ignition hazards of methane or coal dust.Section 7.64(l)(1) from the proposed rule has been modified to clarifythe intent of the Agency. One commenter pointed out that the battery compartmentsneed to be vented to allow the escape of chemical vapors which are liberatedfrom batteries during charging or discharging. Based on this comment, thefinal rule does not require battery compartments to be sealed or watertight.Paragraph (b)(5) of the construction test in andSection;7.67 has also beenrevised to be consistent with this point. Paragraph (1)(2) of the proposalhas been moved to the section on approval marking in andSection;7.69.Paragraphs (m) (1) and (2) require that a blocking diode, or equivalentdevice, be in series with the battery and that the battery charging connector,if provided, be recessed into the blasting unit enclosure. These requirementsare derived from andSection;25.7(d). A blocking diode prevents electric energyin the battery from being available at the charging connector. This energycould cause an ignition of a methane-air atmosphere or initiate an electricdetonator. Also, the charging connector is required to be recessed intothe blasting unit enclosure to prevent short-circuiting of the connectorwhile the unit is on an electrically-conductive surface, such as a metalwork table. Paragraph (m)(3) of the proposal has been relocated to thesection on approval marking in andSection;7.69.Section 7.65 Critical characteristics.This section is new and lists the critical characteristics which are requiredto be inspected or tested on each blasting unit having an approval marking.As defined in subpart A of this part, a ``critical characteristic'' isa feature of a product that, if not manufactured as approved, could havea direct adverse effect on safety. The characteristics identified for inspectionor testing on every blasting unit are the blasting unit's output current,voltage cut-off time, the components that control the voltage and currentthrough each making and breaking electric contact, and the operation ofthe visual indicator and the firing switch.Section 7.66 Output energy test.The output energy test prescribed by this section is used to determinewhether blasting units have energy output sufficient to safely initiateall of the detonators in a blasting circuit. The operating parameters ofthis test are predicated on certain performance characteristics of electricdetonators historically used in underground mining. This test is to beperformed on the blasting unit prior to the construction test. It is alsoperformed after each of the three water baths conducted in the constructiontest.Paragraph (a) is new and specifies test procedures for determining theoutput energy by connecting various resistive loads to the blasting unit.There are three different blasting circuit resistance test conditions withinthe range of the capacity of the blasting unit.Paragraph (b) provides the criteria for acceptable performance of the blastingunit. Paragraph (b)(1) is derived from andSection; 25.7 (g) and (l). It isrevised to require that voltage be cut off at the firing line terminals10 milliseconds after operation of the firing switch rather than 15 millisecondsas previously provided in andSection; 25.7(g). An approved blasting unitmust provide electric energy of sufficient quantity and duration to initiatethe detonators in the blasting circuit. After the detonator initiation,the electric energy must be cut off to reduce the risk of generating aspark by the post-firing contact of wires in the blasting circuit. Thiscan happen when the force of the blast disturbs the surrounding area. Theblast also releases gas and raises and suspends explosive coal dust whichcould be ignited if such sparks are generated. The 10 milliseconds provideample time for the blasting unit to initiate electric detonators and allowfor timing variations caused by component tolerances, temperature variations,and component aging within the blasting unit.Paragraph (b)(2)(i), derived from andSection; 25.7(d), requires that electriccurrent in excess of 50 milliamperes not be available except during firingof the blasting unit. This amount is approximately one-fifth of the maximumno-fire current for typical electric detonators used in underground minesin the U.S. today. According to the 16th edition of the Dupont Handbook,the Institute of Makers of Explosives (IME) has established the maximum``safe'' current permitted to flow through an electric blasting cap withouthazard of initiation as one-fifth of the minimum firing current, or 0.05amperes (50 milliamperes). This provides a current safety factor of fiveor an energy factor of 25. This requirement minimizes the potential hazardof electrical shock to the user and premature firing of electric detonators.Paragraph (b)(2)(ii) is derived from andSection; 25.7(k) and requires thatthe electric current be available through the firing line terminals only.This minimizes the potential hazard of electric shock to the user and preventsthe user from accidentally or deliberately firing electric detonators fromany location on the blasting unit other than at the firing line terminals.Under paragraph (b)(2)(iii), which is derived from andSection;andSection; 25.7(h)and 25.26(a), a blasting unit is required to produce an average firingcurrent of at least 2 amperes during the first 5 milliseconds after operationof the firing switch. This paragraph has been revised from the proposalin response to comments to clarify that the 2 ampere firing current isthe average value over 5 milliseconds. The test is conducted with resistiveloads up to the maximum blasting circuit resistance. An average of 2 amperesfor 5 milliseconds represents the current and time necessary to consistentlyfire a typical electric detonator.Paragraph (b)(2)(iv) is derived from andSection;andSection; 25.7(j) and 25.26(b).It requires that the electric current from the blasting unit not exceedan average of 100 amperes during the first 10 milliseconds after the blastingunit is operated to prevent arcing in the detonator. An electric currentgreater than an average of 100 amperes through a typical electric detonatorcould result in erratic detonator timing, a damaged detonator shell, oran ejected detonator sealing plug.The test procedure, as contained in the proposed rule, included firingthe blasting unit into a resistive load exceeding the unit's rating. Asexplained earlier, this load was to verify operation of the high resistanceindicator and interlock of the firing switch, which are not required inthis final rule. Therefore, the provisions concerning firing into thisload in paragraphs (a) and (b) have been deleted and appropriate modificationsand renumbering made to the remaining provisions of these paragraphs.Section 7.67 Construction test.This section requires that blasting units be tested to determine if theyperform reliably when exposed to the physical stresses of the undergroundmining environment. The construction test provides objective criteria fordetermining whether a blasting unit is sufficiently rugged for use in mining.It is derived from andSection; 25.7(m), which requires the housing to bemechanically strong for mine service, and andSection; 25.7(c), where moistureresistance, drop test, durability of construction and suitability for undergroundservice have been identified, among other factors, to determine the adequacyof design and construction. For clarity, a statement has been added tothis section specifying that this test is to be performed subsequent tothe output energy test of andSection; 7.66.Paragraph (a) sets forth the procedures for testing blasting units. Thetest is conducted by dropping the blasting unit 20 times from a heightof 3 feet onto a concrete floor. The orientation of the blasting unit isto be varied each time it is dropped in an effort to have a different surface,corner, or edge strike the floor first for each drop. Three feet is theheight at which a blasting unit is normally carried. If the blasting unitis not rugged, internal circuitry can be damaged and safe performance ofthe unit can be adversely affected, resulting in misfiring of detonators.Batteries or other components that are ejected from the unit or exposedcan provide an ignition source.This section also requires testing of blasting units for moisture resistanceand the ability to operate properly at various temperatures. After beingdropped, the blasting unit is required to be submerged for 1 hour under1 foot of water at each of three temperatures. Operating blasting unitsat a temperature range of approximately 35 anddegrees;F to 105 anddegrees;F(1.7 anddegrees;C to 40.6 anddegrees;C) is representative of the broad rangeof temperatures that occur in the underground mining environment.The submersion of a blasting unit in 1 foot of water for 1 hour providesan assessment criterion for the requirement, derived from andSection; 25.7(c),that the blasting unit be resistant to moisture. Moisture within the blastingunit could cause corrosion, short circuiting, and physical damage to thecomponents. The test is uncomplicated and does not require special or expensivetest equipment to perform.After operation with the firing line terminals open circuited and shortcircuited, the blasting unit is to be tested in accordance with the outputenergy test. This sequence is repeated following removal from each waterbath. Operating the blasting unit under these conditions is a common eventand should not cause damage to the unit.One commenter stated that the construction test, as contained in the proposedrule, was too severe and found the requirement to test five units excessive.The construction test has been developed to provide uniform testing andto be representative of the mining environment in which blasting unitsare used. Blasting units approved under part 25 have been subjected tosimilar drop tests to determine their ruggedness. Similarly, MSHA utilizesa 3-foot drop test for approval of other hand-held devices such as methanedetectors, portable transceivers and dust sampling devices. The construction test has been modified in the rule to require one blastingunit to be dropped instead of the five units specified in the proposal.Also, the wording has been changed to better define the test procedures.As contained in the proposed rule, the blasting unit would have had tobe dropped until each external surface, corner, or edge had struck thefloor first at least one time. This criteria was derived to provide anobjective means of testing the ruggedness of the blasting unit. This procedurecould have, however, resulted in an inordinate number of tests being conductedon a blasting unit to ensure that each surface, corner, or edge struckthe floor first. The 20 drops specified in the final rule is consistentwith MSHA's procedures when conducting drop tests under other regulations.The modification of the test enables verification of performance at thesame operating parameters as proposed while reducing the number of unitswhich are required to be subjected to this testing. During the developmentof this rule, the construction test has evolved to provide objective performancecriteria for evaluating the ruggedness of blasting units. This test, combinedwith specific construction requirements contained in andSection; 7.64, ensuresa blasting unit design which will function property in the mining environment.Paragraph (b) provides the criteria for evaluating blasting units testedunder this section. Each blasting unit is required to meet the output energytest of andSection; 7.66 after the drop and submersion portions of the constructiontest set out in (a) (1) and (2) have been conducted. The rule also requiresthat there be no damage to the firing line terminals which exposes an electricconductor, that the visual indicator be operational, that no batteriesbe separated from the blasting unit, and that no water be present insidethe blasting unit enclosure, except for the battery compartment. Failureof the blasting unit to meet any of these criteria indicates a reductionin the ability of the blasting unit to perform reliably and safely in undergroundmines. Section 7.68 Firing line terminals test. This section is new and requires that firing line terminals on blastingunits be tested to establish that they provide a secure, low resistanceconnection, as required by andSection; 7.64(e)(1). Paragraph (a) requires that the contract resistance through each firingline terminal be determined and that a 10-pound pull be applied to a No.18 gauge wire that has been connected to each firing line terminal accordingto the manufacturer's instructions. A No. 18 gauge wire is commonly usedfor blasting cables. The 10-pound pull test permits the evaluation of thegripping strength of the connection at the firing line terminal to maintainelectric contact. Paragraph (b) sets forth the acceptable performance criteria for this test.Contact resistance through the firing line terminals shall be less than1 ohm to minimize output energy losses that could reduce the total energyavailable to the blasting circuit. In the pull test, the wire connectedto the blasting unit firing line terminals must remain connected. A commenter suggested that spring-loaded binding posts not be permittedfor blasting unit firing line terminals. The performance requirements ofthis section are sufficient to determine the suitability of a given typeof connecting device. There is no evidence or field experience which suggeststhat spring-loaded binding posts are inappropriate for blasting units inmines. Section 7.69 Approval marking. This section is derived from andSection; 25.11. It specifies the informationto be marked on each approved blasting unit. This section requires thatall blasting units be identified as MSHA approved with a permanent, legiblemarking securely attached, stamped or molded to the outside of the unit.The approval marking must contain (1) the assigned MSHA approval number,(2) the maximum blasting circuit resistance, (3) a warning that the unit'scomponents not be disassembled or removed, and (4) depending on whetheror not rechargeable batteries are used, either the replacement batterytypes or a warning placed next to the charging connector that the batterybe charged only in a fresh air location. The warning against disassemblyor removal of components and the requirement to specify replacement batterytypes are currently included on blasting units under andSection; 25.11(a).The provision in 7.69(e) is new. It requires that a marking be placed adjacentto the charging connector to warn that the battery is to be charged onlyin a fresh air location. The marking is intended to address two hazards:one created by ignitable hydrogen gas which may be present when batteriesare charged and another created by incendive arcing which can occur duringconnecting and disconnecting of the charger in an explosive methane-airatmosphere. This warning is required on other MSHA-approved instrumentscontaining chargeable batteries. In addition, certain detonator characteristics with which the unit willproduce reliable detonation must also be included on the marking. Theseare typical of blasting circuit parameters which must be present in orderto ensure compatibility between the blasting unit and detonator so thatreliable initiation can occur. The availability of this information tothe user is critical to ensure that detonators within the blasting circuitare consistent with the design and demonstrated performance parametersof the blasting unit. These detonators characteristically fire when anaverage 1.5 amperes is applied for 5 milliseconds. They will not misfirewhen up to an average 100 amperes is applied for 10 milliseconds. Theyalso will not fire when a current of 250 milliamperes or less is applied.Hazards are encountered when MSHA-approved blasting units are used withdetonators not having these characteristics. These hazards are unintendedor premature detonation of explosives and misfires resulting in undetonatedexplosives. Part 75, subpart N has been revised to require the use of detonators whichare compatible with the approved blasting unit. As a result, this finalrule has been modified to include this information as necessary to notifythe user of the characteristics a detonator must possess to be electricallycompatible with the blasting unit as a required by 30 CFR part 75.1310(e).Section 7.70 Post-approval product audit. This section requires an approval-holder to make an approved blasting unitavailable to MSHA at a mutually agreeable site and time. The approval-holdermay be required to provide, at no cost to MSHA, an approved blasting unitno more than once a year, except for cause. However, MSHA can obtain blastingunits from the approval-holder or other sources such as mine suppliersor distributors at any time at MSHA expense. All post-approval audits of blasting units approved under this part willbe conducted in accordance with this section and with andSection; 7.8 ofsubpart A of this part. Detailed discussion of this provision is foundin 53 FR 23486, at 23493-23494 (June 22, 1988). When deficiencies are found during MSHA audits of approved blasting units,MSHA will require that the approval-holder take the necessary correctiveaction to address the deficiencies. These actions include, but are notlimited to, the approval-holder recalling or retrofitting the approvedblasting units involved and issuing user notices. Consistent with part7, andSection; 7.9, revocation of the approval by MSHA may result when discrepanciesin approved blasting units are not successfully corrected. Section 7.71 Approval checklist. This section requires that manufacturers provide, with each blasting unit,a description of what is necessary to maintain the blasting unit in anapproved condition. Maintaining blasting units in an approved conditionis fundamental to their safe use in underground mines and is required ofall mine operators. Section 7.72 New technology. The technical requirements for blasting units include both design and performancerequirements. MSHA is aware that design requirements can, at times, limitthe introduction of technological improvements or hinder new applicationsof existing technology. To address this, the rule includes a ``new technology''provision which applies to either new technology or new applications ofexisting technology to blasting units. The rule therefore allows approval of blasting units that incorporate technologyfor which the specific requirements of this subpart are not appropriateif MSHA determines that the blasting units are as safe as those which havemet the requirements of this subpart D. To implement this provision, MSHAwill prescribe appropriate technical requirements and test procedures whensuch approval is sought.Once MSHA approves a blasting unit under this section, the Agency willmake the modified tests and requirements used by MSHA to evaluate a particulartechnology available to manufacturers and other interested persons. If,over a period of time, MSHA receives a number of applications for the sametype of technology or newly adapted technology, MSHA will revise the blastingunit approval regulations through the rulemaking process to recognize suchdevelopments.<ITAG tagnum="81">Derivation Table</ITAG>The following derivation table lists: (1) Each section number of the finalrule (new section) and (2) the section number of the standard from whichthe section is derived (old section).<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,r25</C> <H1>New section</H1><H1>Old section</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">7.61<D>25.1.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7.62<D>25.2.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7.63 (a), (b)<D>25.6(c).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7.63(c)<D>New.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7.63(d)<D>25.6(a).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7.64(a)<D>25.7 (g)-(i).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7.64(b)<D>25.25.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7.64(c)<D>25.7(f).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7.64(d)(1)<D>25.7(e) and 25.8(b)(3).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7.64(d)(2)<D>25.7(f).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7.64(e)(1)<D>New.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7.64(e)(2)<D>25.7(c)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7.64(e) (3), (4)<D>25.7(k).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7.64(f)<D>25.7(c) and 25.8(b)(1).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7.64(g)<D>25.7(d).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7.64(h)<D>25.7(c).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7.64(i)<D>25.8(b)(2).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7.64(j)<D>25.7 (c), (m).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7.64(k)<D>25.7(e).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7.64(l)<D>25.7(m) and 25.8(b)(4).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7.64(m)<D>25.7(d).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7.65<D>New.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7.66(a)<D>New.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7.66(b)(1)<D>25.7 (g) and (l).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7.66(b)(2)(i)<D>25.7(d).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7.66(b)(2)(ii)<D>25.7(k).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7.66(b)(2)(iii)<D>25.7(h) and 25.26(a).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7.66(b)(2)(iv)<D>25.7(j) and 25.26(b).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7.67<D>25.7 (c) and (m).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7.68<D>New.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7.69<D>25.11</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7.70<D>New.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7.71<D>New.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7.72<D>New.</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Distribution Table</ITAG>The following distribution table lists: (1) Each section number of thepart 25 standard (old section) and (2) each section number of final subpartD of part 7 (new section).

Drafting Information</ITAG>The principal persons responsible for preparing this final rule are: KennethA. Sproul, Arthur E.

Fort, Office of the Solicitor, Department of Labor.<ITAG tagnum="85">V. Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>In accordance with Executive Order 12291, MSHA has prepared an analysisto identify the potential costs and benefits associated with subpart D.This analysis has formed the basis for the Initial Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act. In this analysis,MSHA has determined that this rule neither results in major cost increasesnor has an incremental effect of $100 million or more on the economy. Therefore,the rule is not within the criteria for a major rule, and a RegulatoryImpact Analysis is not required.The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires that agencies evaluate and include,wherever possible, compliance alternatives that minimize any adverse impacton small businesses when developing regulatory rules. This rule does notsignificantly alter the existing technical requirements for multiple-shotblasting units.This rule increases private-sector involvement in the approval of miningequipment. For the first time, in lieu of testing only by MSHA, the applicantor a third party selected by the applicant will test multiple-shot blastingunits. The Agency anticipates that this new procedure will reduce duplicatetesting of products in some cases and eliminate associated costs and potentialdelays in equipment approvals. In addition, the procedure is expected toenhance the safety of miners through the more rapid introduction of technologicaladvances in mining products.Any necessary testing of products required by MSHA either is not substantiallydifferent from that currently undertaken or does not impose significantcosts compared to the sales value of the product. The application procedures,quality assurance program, and annual audit do not impose significant costs.This subpart D clarifies the standards which must be met by industry forapproval of multiple-shot blasting units and makes the approval processmore efficient, thereby reducing costs for large as well as small businesses.The Agency estimates that incremental annual cost increases totaling $8,659are offset by an annual cost savings of approximately $3,699. The net incrementalannual cost impact, therefore, is expected to be $4,960. In addition, thefinal rule imposes an incremental initial cost of $74 for each blastingunit manufacturer.
