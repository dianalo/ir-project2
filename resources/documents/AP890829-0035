Five Central American nations have asked the United Nations tomonitor the voluntary disbanding of up to 11,000 Contras camped inHonduras, and the repatriation of as many as 12,000 of theirdependents.   ``They are asking us to monitor operations to disarm theopposition, and that is something that is very complicated and isnot very much in our practice,'' Perez de Cuellar said afterbriefing the Security Council on Monday.   ``That is why I need assurances that if we send people there,there is cooperation from the resistance forces,'' he said.   The presidents of Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala andCosta Rica signed an accord Aug. 7 calling for the disbanding of theContras 90 days after a joint resettlement mission of U.N. andOrganization of American States representatives is formed.   ``We'll be in contact with the resistance, to find ways and meansto be in touch with them in order to have assurances from them thatthey will accept disarming, to give their arms to the UnitedNations,'' the U.N. chief said.   These contacts will take place ``as soon as possible,'' he added.   The secretary-general of the OAS, Joao Clemente Baena Soares ofBrazil, and Perez de Cuellar announced Friday they will launch themission Sept. 6.   By having the ``International Support and VerificationCommission'' begin its work on that date, the OAS and U.N. chiefsset Dec. 5 as the target date for the voluntary repatriation.   Numerous Contra field commanders and guerrillas have vowed theywill not give up their fight.   A U.N. diplomat active in Central American affairs, however, saidpreliminary talks with the Contras indicate they are quite willingto go home or be resettled, and said little resistance is expected.   The United States had lobbied the Central American nations toallow the Contras to stay in their camps through the Feb. 25national elections in Nicaragua, to maintain pressure on the leftistSandinista government to allow a fair campaign.   Even Honduras, however, which has received lavish military andforeign aid from Washington, agreed earlier this month there was nojustification to continue their mission.   The United States gives the Contras $4.5 million a month innon-lethal aid that may also be used for resettlement.   Congress cut off funds for weapons last year, prompting theContras to arrange a truce with Nicaragua's government last year.Since then they have launched only sporadic raids.</TEXT></DOC>
