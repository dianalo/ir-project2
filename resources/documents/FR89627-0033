Executive Summary</ITAG>Complete and accurate financial reporting by public companies is of paramountimportance to the disclosure system underlying the stability and efficientoperation of our capital markets. Investors need reliable financial informationwhen making investment decisions. Interim financial reporting is an importantpart of that full disclosure program because investors rely on, and reactquickly to, quarterly results.Since 1975, the Commission has required that independent accountants reviewquarterly financial information filed with annual financial statementsof larger, more widely traded registrants.\1\<NOTE/> Among the reasons for adopting this requirement, which increasedthe involvement of the independent accountant with quarterly reporting,were expectations that such a requirement would result in greater careand attention being devoted to quarterly reports, thereby increasing thelikelihood that management would discover needed adjustments on a timelybasis. The Commission also believed that the requirement would bring thereporting, accounting and analytical expertise of independent accountantsto bear on the quarterly reporting process.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Regulation S-K, Item 302(a); 17 CFR 229.302(a).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ <T3>See generally, </T3>Accounting Series Release No. (ASR) 177 (September10, 1975) (40 FR 46107) (hereinafter ``ASR 177'').Although the Commission did not require that reviews be done on a timelybasis (<T3>i.e., </T3>before the quarterly financial data is initially filed withthe Commission) it strongly encouraged such a practice. The Commissionstated its belief that it was likely that timely reviews would occur sothat management would be less likely to face the necessity of revisingquarterly data at the time year-end statements are published.\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ <T3>Id.</T3>The Commission continues to believe that timely involvement by the independentaccountant with interim financial data would improve the reliability ofsuch data, particularly in today's environment of increasingly complexfinancial transactions and rapidly changing business practices. Further,the National Commission on Fraudulent Financial Reporting (the ``TreadwayCommission'') recently made a recommendation that the SEC should requireindependent accountants to review quarterly financial data of all publiccompanies before release to the public. The recommendation was based onthe Treadway Commision's belief that timely review would improve the reliabilityof quarterly reporting and increase the likelihood of preventing or detectingfraudulent financial reporting through auditor involvement with quarterlyfinancial data.\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Report of the National Commission on Fraudulent FinancialReporting (October 1987) (hereinafter ``Treadway Commission Report'') p.53.Given the Commission's continued belief that timely review by the independentaccountant would enhance the reliability of interim data and increase thelikelihood that the independent accountant will discover financial reportingproblems, and considering the Treadway Commission recommendation, the Commissionintends to reconsider the existing Item 302(a) requirements and determinewhether any changes may be needed. Among the initiatives being consideredby the Commission is a possible requirement that (10 interim \5\<NOTE/> financial data of registrants be reviewed by independentpublic accountants before such information is filed with the Commissionand (2) a report issued by the independent accountant upon completion ofthe review be included by the registrant in its Form 10-Q \6\<NOTE/> and in any registration statements that include interim information.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ For purposes of this concept release, it is contemplatedthat ``interim financial data'' would be data for periods currently addressedby Item 302(a). In general, then, ``interim financial data,'' as used inthis release, refers to <T3>quarterly </T3>data. <T3>See </T3>note 22, <T3>infra. </T3>In addition, the Commission is requesting comment on whetherother interim periods should be subject to requirements of timely auditorreview. <T3>Infra, </T3>Section IV.A. Thus, the meaning of ``interim'' in thiscontext is flexible; it may be expanded in any proposed or final rulemakingson this subject in response to comments.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ 17 CFR 249.308a.Before proposing any rulemaking in this area, the Commission believes itis appropriate to obtain input from the public about both the experienceof registrants and independent accountants with the Commission's existingItem 302(a) requirements and the estimated incremental costs and benefitsthat should be considered in assessing whether to propose a requirementfor timely involvement by the independent accountant with interim financialinformation. The Commission also is requesting comments regarding whethersuch a requirement should apply to all interim periods and whether certainregistrants should be excluded from such a requirement, as well as thepotential impact of such a requirement in the following additional areas:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Timely release of earnings</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Establish sufficient knowledge when accountant not engaged to performprior year audit</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Adequacy of procedures performed by the accountant</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Inclusion of accountant's review report</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Potential for over-reliance on review reports</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Rules 436 \7\</ITAG><NOTE/> exemption<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ 17 CFR 230.436.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">A more detailed discussion of these specific areas begins under SectionIII of this release.The Commission also is considering whether to expand the number of registrantssubject to Regulation S-K Item 302(a), which currently requires larger,more widely traded companies to disclose certain quarterly data in theirannual audited financial statements. Subjecting additional registrantsto Item 302(a) would resut in auditor review of their quarterly information,but the review would not necessarily have to occur on a timely basis. Thebenefits of such a review by the auditor are potentially relevant to registrantsregardless of their size and trading activity.Comments are also invited on any issues commentators believe are releventto the Commission's consideration of auditor involvement with interim information.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Background</ITAG>A. Historical BackgroundThe Commission began considering disclosure of quarterly information inannual financial statements in 1974 when it published a proposal that thisinformation be included in an audited footnote.\8\<NOTE/> This proposal evolved to the present requirement for unauditeddata adopted in Accounting Series Release (ASR) No. 177.\9\<NOTE/> The Commission noted in ASR 177 that when the annual financialstatements contained ``unaudited'' quarterly data it would be presumedthat the auditor had followed ``appropriate professional standards andprocedure with respect to the data.'' \10\<NOTE/> The Commission expressed its belief that the following benefitswould also arise:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ Securities Act Release No. 5549 (December 19, 1974) (40FR 1079).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ ASR 177.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ <T3>Id.</T3><ITAG tagnum="21">Either timely or retrospective involvement should increase the careand attention devoted to quarterly reports which will increase the likelihoodthat management will discover needed adjustments on a timely basis. Inaddition, management may be able to identify problem areas more promptlyso that unusual charges and credits are not made so frequently in the lastmonth of a fiscal year. Finally, the involvement of independent accountantswill add the expertise of professional accountants with wide experiencein reporting problems to the quarterly reporting process. This should improveindividual company reporting and direct greater professional attentionto the general problems of interim reporting.\11\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ <T3>Id.</T3>While recognizing that involvement of the independent accountant with interimreporting would not prevent all deficiences, the Commission stated itsbelief that such involvement would enhance the reliability of interm reportsand reduce the likelihood of abuse. The Commission concluded that, in thefinal analysis, the benefits of auditor involvement in quarterly data areexpected primarily to result from improvement in the quality of interimreporting and the annual auditing process and only secondarily from theprevention of perceived abuses.\12\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ <T3>Id.</T3>Although the Commission has strongly encouraged timely reviews of quarterlydata,\1\\3\<NOTE/> it has not required them. In fact, Regulation S-X states:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\ <T3>Id.</T3><ITAG tagnum="21">The interim financial information included in filings with the Commissionneed not be reviewed by an independent public accountant prior to filing.If, however, a review of the data is made in accordance with establishedprofessional standards and procedures for such a review, the registrantmay state that the independent accountant has performed such a review.If such a statement is made, the report of the independent accountant onsuch review shall accompany the interim financial information.\1\\4\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\ Regulation S-X, Rule 10-01(d); 17 CFR 210.10-01(d).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Although not mandating the timely involvement of independent accountantswith quarterly reporting, the Commission expected that such involvementwould occur voluntarily so that management would be less likely to facethe necessity of revising quarterly data at the time year-end statementsare published.The Commission also stated its belief that, as the reviews of quarterlyinformation became a regular part of the audit examination of public companies,the timing of audit procedures would be revised so that testing of internalcontrols and the analytical reviews of financial reports would occur throughoutthe year. It was expected that this would increase the efficiency of theauditors in identifying and focusing promptly on potentially troublesomeareas in the audit. As a result, it was the Commission's expectation thatthe costs of such reviews would not be entirely incremental and that suchreviews should reduce the cost of the annual audit examination. It wasfurther expected that such costs would not be continuing since audit programsand corporate control systems would be improved promptly to keep such costsat a minimum.\1\\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\ ASR 177.The Commission's consideration of the costs and benefits of disclosureand auditor reviews of quarterly information also was evident in the Commission'sdetermination that the present Item 302(a) disclosure requirements shouldnot apply to registrants that do not meet certain criteria; <T3>i.e.,</T3> smaller, less actively traded registrants.\1\\6\<NOTE/> Although the Commission concluded that it was not clear thatthe benefits would outweigh the costs for smaller, less widely traded registrants,the Commission noted that it would continue to study the question.\1\\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\ <T3>See</T3> Regulation S-K, Item 302(a)(5), regarding disclosure of selectedquarterly financial data, note 20,<T3> infra.</T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\ ASR 177.In ASR 177, the Commission also noted that an accountant's report basedon its review of the quarterly data may provide significant and usefulinformation to investors. Therefore, the Commission encouraged the issuanceof such reports.\1\\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\ <T3>Id.</T3>B. Current RequirementsThe requirements of the Commission concerning auditor involvement in interimfinancial data are currently addressed in Regulation S-K, Item 302(a).\1\\9\<NOTE/> This item requires, for certain registrants (essentiallythe larger, more widely traded),\2\\0\<NOTE/> disclosure, as supplementary financial information in theannual financial statement,\2\\1\<NOTE/> of selected quarterly \2\\2\<NOTE/> financial data, including: net sales, gross profit, income(loss) before extraordinary items and cumulative effect of a change inaccounting, per share data based upon such income (loss), and net income(loss) for each quarter within the two most recent fiscal years and anysubsequent interim period. The item also calls for appropriate reconciliationsand descriptions of any adjustments to quarterly information previouslyreported in the Form 10-Q filed for any quarter. Item 302(a)(4) \2\\3\<NOTE/> states that if the related financial statements (<T3>i.e.,</T3> the annual financial statements containing the quarterlydata) have been audited, then appropriate professional standards and procedures,as enumerated in the Statements of Auditing Standards issued by the AuditingStandards Board of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants(AICPA),\2\\4\<NOTE/> shall be followed by the reporting accountant with regardto this quarterly data. Because annual financial statements filed withthe Commission are required to be audited,\2\\5\<NOTE/> the effect of Item 302(a)(4) is that the quarterly data includedin the annual statement must be reviewed by the auditor.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ <T3>See</T3> note 1, <T3>supra.</T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ Item 302(a)(5), 17 CFR 229.302(a)(5), generally requiresany registrant, except a foreign private issuer eligible to use Form 20-F,that meets both of two tests to provide quarterly data in an unauditedfootnote to the annual audited financial statements. The first test iswhether the registrant:<ITAG tagnum="28">(A) Has securities registered pursuant to section 12(b) of the ExchangeAct (other than mutual life insurance companies); or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(B) Is an insurance company that is subject to the reporting requirementsof section 15(d) of the Exchange Act and has securities which also meetthe criteria set forth in paragraphs (C)(1) and (C)(2) immediately following;or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(C) Has securities registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the ExchangeAct that also</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(1) Are quoted on the National Association of Securities Dealers AutomatedQuotation System, and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(2) Meet the following criteria:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(i) Three or more dealers make a market in such stock, or the stockis registered on a securities exchange that is exempted by the Commissionfrom registration as a national securities exchange pursuant to Section5 of the Exchange Act;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(ii) There are 800 or more holders of record, as defined in Rule 12g5-1(17 CFR 240.12g5-1), under the Exchange Act, of the stock who are not officers,directors, or beneficial owners of 10 percent or more of the stock;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(iii) The registrant is a United States corporation;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(iv) There are 300,000 or more of such securities outstanding in additionto shares held beneficially by officers, directors, or beneficial ownersof more than 10 percent of the stock; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(v) In addition, the registrant meets two of the three following requirements:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(A) The shares described in paragraph (C)(2)(iv) above have a marketvalue of at least $2.5 million;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(B) The minimum representative bid price of such stock is at least$5 per share; or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(C) The registrant continues to have at least $2.5 million of capital,surplus, and undivided profits.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">The second test is whether the registrant and its consolidated subsidiaries(A) have had net income after taxes but before extraordinary items andthe cumulative effect of a change in accounting, of at least $250,000 foreach of the last three fiscal years; or (B) had total assets of at least$200,000,000 for the last fiscal year-end.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\ Item 302(a) information is required to be disclosed inForm 10-K. In addition, Item 302(a) information is required to be disclosedin, among others, Registration Forms S-1 and S-2 under the 1933 Act, 17CFR 239.11 and 239.12, respectively.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\22\ Item 302(a) requires disclosure of selected data foreach full quarter within the two most recent fiscal years and any subsequentinterim period for which financial statements are included or requiredto be included by Article 3 of Regulation S-X. Therefore, Item 302(a) isaddressed primarily to quarterly financial data; in addition, Item 302addresses data for certain other interim periods. <T3>See, e.g.,</T3> Rule 3-12 of Regulation S-X.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\23\ 17 CFR 229.302(a)(4).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\24\ The Auditing Standards Board is the senior technicalbody designated by the AICPA to promulgate auditing standards.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\25\ Regulations S-X, Rule 3-01, 3-02; 17 CFR 210.3-01, 210.3-02.The standards and procedures for this review of quarterly data are setforth in Statement on Auditing Standards No. 36, ``Review of Interim FinancialInformation'' (codified at AU section 722 and hereinafter referred to asSAS 36). Review procedures pursuant to SAS 36 consist primarily of inquiriesand analytical review procedures concerning significant accounting mattersrelating to the financial information to be reported. A description ofthese procedures is included in the standard review report, which statesin part:<ITAG tagnum="21">A review of interim financial information consists principally ofobtaining an understanding of the system for the preparation of interimfinancial information, applying analytical review procedures to financialdata, and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accountingmatters.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">SAS 36, paragraph 18.SAS 36 does not require that interim data be reviewed on a timely basis.Thus, the quarterly data contained in the Form 10-Q filed with the Commissionis not required to be reviewed before the Form 10-Q is submitted. Paragraph27 of SAS 36 expressly permits the auditor to perform the review proceduresat the time of the audit of the annual financial statements.Review procedures pursuant to SAS 36 are substantially less in scope thanthose employed in audits in accordance with generally accepted auditingstandards. Audit procedures require substantially more work, includingdetailed testing of account balances and transactions, confirmation ofamounts due from third parties and observation of physical inventories,among other procedures. Accordingly, a review does not provide the basisfor the expression of an audit opinion. SAS 36, paragraph 3 states:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * A review of interim financial information does not provide abasis for the expression of such an [audit] opinion, because the reviewdoes not contemplate a study and evaluation of internal accounting control;tests of accounting records and of responses to inquiries by obtainingcorroborating evidential matter through inspection, observation, or confirmation;and certain other procedures ordinarily performed during an audit. A reviewmay bring to the accountant's attention significant matters affecting theinterim financial information, but it does not provide assurance that theaccountant will become aware of all significant matters that would be disclosedin an audit.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Further, the standard review report, as set out in SAS 36, paragraph18, states that a review of interim financial information<ITAG tagnum="20">is substantially less in scope than an examination in accordance withgenerally accepted auditing standards the object of which is the expressionof an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly,we do not express such an opinion.</ITAG>In summary, Commission rules require the involvement of the independentaccountant with quarterly financial data that accompany annual financialstatements of the larger, more widely traded registrants. No similar requirementpresently exists for small registrants. When cost/benefit considerationswere addressed, the Commission expressed its belief that significant benefitswould be derived from the involvement of the independent accountant, whetherthe review is performed on a timely or retrospective basis. In addition,the Commission has encouraged the involvement on a timely basis and hassupported issuance of a report by the independent accountant. The Commissionhas stated its expectation that management would elect timely reviews withthe expectation of increasing the benefits derived from the review. TheCommission has also specifically stated that it would continue to examinethe question of auditor involvement with interim data as it gained experiencewith the Item 302(a) reporting requirement.C. The Treadway CommissionDuring the period from October 1985 to September 1987, a study of the factorscontributing to fraudulent financial reporting was conducted by the TreadwayCommission.\26\<NOTE/> In October 1987, the Treadway Commission issued its finalreport containing recommendations to reduce the incidence of fraudulentfinancial reporting.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\26\ For purposes of its study and report, the Treadway Commissiondefined fraudulent financial reporting as ``intentional or reckless conduct,whether act or omission, that results in materially misleading financialstatements * * *. Fraudulent financial reporting differs from other causesof materially misleading financial statements, such as unintentional errors.The Commission also distinguished fraudulent financial reporting from othercorporate improprieties, such as employee embezzlements, violations ofenvironmental or product safety regulations and tax fraud, which do notnecessarily cause the financial statements to be materially inaccurate.''Treadway Commission Report, at 2. Copies of the Treadway Commission Reportand related background materials are available from the American Instituteof Certified Public Accountants, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York,NY 10036. Sponsoring organizations were the American Institute of CertifiedPublic Accountants, the American Accounting Association, the FinancialExecutives Institute, the Institute of Internal Auditors and the NationalAssociation of Accountants.Among the Treadway Commission's recommendations was the following specificrecommendation regarding the timely review of quarterly financial data:<ITAG tagnum="21">The SEC should require independent public accountants to review quarterlyfinancial data of all public companies before release to the public.\27\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\27\ Treadway Commission Report, at 53.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The Treadway Commission expressed its view that timely auditor involvementwould improve the reliability of quarterly reporting and increase the likelihoodof preventing or detecting fraudulent financial reporting. The TreadwayCommission further stated that the review of quarterly financial data beforepublic release would assure the public of more frequent review of reportingpractices of public companies by an independent and objective party, whichshould improve the financial reporting discipline in many public companies.Further, the Treadway Commission stated that the review should be a ``limited''review, as described in existing auditing literature.\2\\8\<NOTE/> In its Report, the Treadway Commission specifically addressedthe cost/benefit question in the aggregate and reached a general conclusionthat the benefits of its recommendations (including timely review of quarterlyreports) would justify the costs, stating as follows:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\8\ <T3>Id.; see </T3>Section II.B, <T3>supra.</T3><ITAG tagnum="21">For some companies, implementing these recommendations will requirelittle or even no change from current practices; for other companies, itwill mean adding or improving a recommended practice. Whether it meansadding or improving a practice, the benefits justify the costs. TreadwayCommission Report, at 11.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Costs must be viewed in two ways. The cost of implementation can bequantified. The other cost_the cost of failing to implement these recommendations_isimpossible to quantify, yet it may be far larger and more important. Thiscost is the potential loss of confidence of investors and the public incorporate management and in the financial reporting system. Our capitalmarkets and our private enterprise system cannot bear the loss of the public'strust and confidence in the integrity of the financial reporting system.Treadway Commission Report, at 29.</ITAG>The Treadway Commission's recommendations are generally consistent withthe views expressed previously by the Commission, but they differ fromthe proposals being considered by the Commission in this concept releasein two respects. First, the Treadway Commission report addresses quarterlyinformation, while the Commission recognizes that registrants may includein filings with the Commisison financial information regarding interimperiods other than quarterly periods.\2\\9\<NOTE/> Second, the Treadway Commission recommended that the reviewsbe performed prior to release of earnings to the public. The Commissionis considering whether to propose that the reviews be performed prior tothe filing of interim data with the Commission. The Commission believesthat there may in fact be no substantive difference between the pre-releaseand pre-filing reviews since, as is understood to be the case with respectto the release of annual results, a practice may develop whereby interimfinancial results generally would not be released until the independentaccountant has completed substantially all of the required procedures.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\9\ In accordance with Regulation S-X, Rule 3-12, 17 CFR210.3-12, financial statements included in a registration statement filedwith the Commission must be updated to ensure that they are within 135days of the date the registration statement is expected to become effective.This may result in certain registrants including interim financial statementsfor other than quarterly periods. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>note 22, <T3>supra</T3>. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Possible Changes to Current Requirements   </ITAG>In view of the Commisison's experience with the current requirements concerningauditor involvement with interim data, and in view of the Treadway Commissionrecommendation described above, the Commission is considering requiringthat (1) Interim financial data required to be filed with the Commission bereviewed by an independent public accountant before it is filed; \3\\0\<NOTE/> and<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\0\ Thus, quarterly data included in Form 10-Qs would berequired to be reviewed by the independent public accountant <T3>before </T3>the 10-Q is filed, not afterwards, before the filing ofthe annual report, as is presently allowed.   (2) A report be issued by the independent accountant upon completion ofthe review and be included by the registrant in its Form 10-Q and in anyregistration statements that include interim information.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The Commission contemplates that the standards and procedures forthe review and report would be the current standards for review of interimfinancial data as set forth in SAS 36, or, subject to revision of the currentstandards, might be carried out in accordance with more rigorous standardsand procedures.\3\\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\1\ for the meaning of the term ``interim'' for purposesof this concept release, <T3>See </T3>note 5, <T3>supra</T3>.   If adopted, these requirements would expand on current requirements ofItem 302(a) in three important respects because they would(1) Apply to <T3>all </T3>registrants, as well as the larger, more actively traded registrantscurrently subject to Item 302(a); \3\\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\2\As stated, <T3>infra, </T3>Section IV.A., the Commission may consider narrowing thescope of the proposal so that smaller registrants may be exempt, and isseeking comments on that subject.   (2) Require auditor review of interim financial data to be timely; <T3>i.e., </T3>to take place before the interim data is filed with theCommission, while Item 302(a) permits a review subsequent to filing; and  (3) Require the independent accountant to issue a report on the interimdata and that the report be included with the data when it is filed; Item302(a) contains no such requirement.The Commission continues to believe that requiring timely auditor involvementwith interim reports would serve to improve the reliability of financialreporting. Interim financial statements include estimates to a greaterextent than is usual in annual financial statements. Such estimates areaffected by judgments made at interim dates concerning anticipated resultsof operations for the remainder of the annual period and are thus inherentlymore uncertain. In addition, it appears that registrants in the currentenvironment face increasingly complex financial transactions and events,the accounting for which may not be clearly defined in the accounting literature.Accordingly, it would appear that the reliability of interim financialstatements would be improved if such estimates and the accounting for newtransactions and events were reviewed by the independent accountant ona timely basis.              A. Costs and BenefitsThe Commission notes that any incremental costs of requiring timely reviewsof interim financial data by the independent accountant may differ betweenthose companies presently subject to the Commission's requirements fordisclosing selected quarterly financial data in their annual audited financialstatements and those that are not. Although the Commission recognizes thattimely reviews may have the greatest cost impact on those companies notpresently subject cost impact on those companies not presently subjectto Item 302(a), the Commission also acknowledges the Treadway Commissionview that these companies may benefits the most from implementing suchprocedures.\33\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\3\The Treadway Commission Report notes that ``these (smaller)entities may have a disproportionately greater risk of fraudulent financialreporting and thus may reap proportionately greater benefits'' from implementingthe recommendations contained in the Report. Treadway Commission Report,at 29.The Commission believes that due to the need for timely data and otherfactors, it is not necessary or practical to require that the independentaccountant audit the interim financial statements. However, it is the staff'sunderstanding that accountants presently performing timely reviews of quarterlyinformation may be doing more extensive procedures than required by SAS36. This could be due to the fact that it may be more efficient to performcertain audit procedures concerning significant transactions at the timeof the quarterly review rather that at year-end. The timely performanceof these audit procedures may result in efficiencies that mitigate anyincremental costs incurred by performing the reviews on a timely basis.The costs of auditor involvement with interim information may vary dependingon whether the registrant would be required to include a report issuedby its independent accountant on the interim financial information\3\\4\<NOTE/> in its filings with the Commission on Form 10-Q and in registrationstatements that include interim information. Such a report would providea forum for auditor communication to the public of significant reservationsabout, or exceptions to, interim reports of the registrant.\3\\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\4\SAS 36 contains an example of an accountant's reportat paragraph 18.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\5\<T3>See</T3> paragraphs 20-22 of SAS 36, ``Circumstances Requiring Modificationof the Accountant's Review Report.''Presently, there may be situations where the auditor has performed proceduressufficient to issue a report\3\\6\<NOTE/> but either the report is never issued or it is issued butnot included by the registrant in its quarterly filings with the Commission.It has been suggested that, even in situations where reviews are beingperformed on a timely basis in accordance with the existing professionalstandards, the imposition of a requirement to include a report would increasecosts, perhaps significantly.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\6\<T3>See </T3>paragraphs 4-15 of SAS 36, ``Procedures for a Review of InterimFinancial Information.''Additional cost factors include the possibility that a timely interim reviewrequirement may result in delays in prompt public release of earnings information.In addition, incremental costs may be incurred by registrants that changeauditors. As prescribed by SAS 36, knowledge of the company's accountingand financial reporting practices and its system of internal control isan important factor in the performance of interim review procedures\3\\7\<NOTE/> and, although usually obtained during the audit of the annualfinancial statements, the need for such knowledge is not diminished ifan audit has not been performed. As such, ``the accountant needs to considerwhether, under the particular circumstances involved, he can acquire sufficientknowledge about these matters for the purposes contemplated in a reviewof interim financial information.''\3\\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\7\SAS 36, paragraph 9.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\8\SAS 36, note 4.B. Reliance on Auditors's Reports onInterim DataAnother aspect of requiring the inclusion of SAS 36 reports involves thereliance that may be placed on such a report by the readers of the financialstatements. Some autitors may believe there is a risk that readers willplace a higher level of reliance on the report than the underlying proceduresmay warrant, even though a general description of the procedures and theirscope in comparison to an audit is provided in the middle paragraph tothe standard accountant's review report.\3\\9\<NOTE/> Further, some may believe that there is potential for misunderstandingas to the meaning of the accountant's review report that expresses negativeassurance that the accountant is not aware of any modifications that shouldbe made to the financial statements. The sample report in SAS 36 states,in part:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\9\SAS 36, paragraph 18.<ITAG tagnum="21">Based on our review we are not aware of any material modificationthat should be made to the accompanying financial (information or statements)for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.\4\\0\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\0\<T3>Id</T3>.As previously discussed, a review is substantially less in scope than anaudit and situations may arise where the auditor may not perform extensiveprocedures on certain new transactions or events. As a result, during theperformance of its year-end examination the auditor may conclude that theregistrant has not adopted the appropriate method of accounting for thesetransactions in its interim reports. The Commission staff is concernedthat some registrants may inappropriately interpret the issuance of a standardinterim review report as an indication of the accountant's agreement withthe accounting treatment adopted for these new transactions or events.C. Possible Changes to the Rule 436 Exemption From LiabilityUnder existing Commission Rule 436,\4\\1\<NOTE/> reports by independent accountants on interim financial informationthat are included in a filing with the Commission are not considered tobe a part of a registration statement, or a report, prepared or certifiedby an accountant within the meaning of Sections 7 and 11 of the SecuritiesAct of 1933.\4\\2\<NOTE/> This exemption from the liability provisions of Section 11was adopted by the Commission in 1979 to encourage increased auditor involvementwith interim financial information and greater use of reports by accountantsconcerning unaudited financial information.\4\\3\<NOTE/> If such reports are required to be included in filings withthe Commission, however, this encouragement would no longer be necessary.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\1\ 17 CFR 230.436.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\2\ 15 U.S.C. 77g, 77k.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\3\ ASR 274 (December 28, 1979) (45 FR 1601).Removal of the exemption may result in (1) increased attention by the independentaccountant to the preparation of the review report and the performanceof the review, and (2) the ability under Section 11 of persons to recoverdamages they have suffered as a result of any untrue statement in a requiredaccountant's report that has been included in a registration statementunder the Securities Act of 1933.\4\\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\4\ The accountants, however, would remain subject to liabilityunder Section 17 of the Securities Act of 1933, and section 10(b) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934. <T3>See </T3>ASR 274, note 43, <T3>supra</T3>.Maintaining the exemption from Section 11 liability, however, may continueto be appropriate because of the limited nature of the review proceduresbeing performed. In other words, Section 11 liability may not be appropriateunless the accountant performs full audit procedures. Further, the costsof removing the exemption could include increased litigation risks foraccountants that may result in increased procedures being performed bythe accountant and higher fees to the registrant.D. Possible Changes to Item 302(a)As part of its deliberations as to whether to propose a requirement fortimely reviews, the Commission also intends to reconsider the existingrequirements for disclosure of interim information pursuant to RegulationS-K, Item 302(a). If the Commission decides to propose a requirement fortimely reviews, it may conclude that the Item 302(a) disclosure requirementsshould be (1) expanded so that all registrants that would be required tohave timely reviews performed would also be required to disclose the quarterlydata in their annual reports to shareholders or (2) deleted. Alternatively,if the Commission decides not to pursue a rule proposal that would requiretimely reviews, it may decide instead to propose deleting the Item 302(a)exclusion for the smaller, less actively traded registrants. Such a proposalcould result in all registrants including summarized interim informationin their annual reports and having their independent accountants performreviews of such data, although not necessarily on a timely basis.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Areas in Which the Commission is Inviting Comment </ITAG>A. Potential Impact of Requiring that All Registrants Have Timely Reviewsof Interim Data Performed by Their Independent AccountantThe Commission invites comments regarding the incremental costs and benefitsexpected to be derived from a requirement that all interim financial statementsbe reviewed by the independent accountant on a timely basis and whethersuch benefits are likely to exceed the incremental costs, although it recognizesthat the benefits of requiring timely review may be difficult to quantifyaccurately. In this regard, the Commission is interested in comments concerningthe experience of registrants and independent accountants with the existingItem 302(a) requirements regarding interim financial data.Specifically, the Commission requests comments regarding the following:(1) Costs and benefits experienced by registrants that have been requiredby the existing Item 302(a) requirements to involve their independent accountantwith interim financial reporting;(2) Cost and benefit considerations that led registrants subject to theexisting Item 302(a) requirements to the decision either (a) To involve their independent accountant with interim data on a timelybasis or (b) Not to involve their independent accountant with interim data on atimely basis;\4\\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\5\ Comments may be particularly relevant from those registrantsthat have recently engaged their accountants to perform timely reviewsand thus can provide the most recent information on the impact of sucha change.(3) For those registrants excluded from the existing Item 302(a) requirements,whether such registrants have elected to involve their independent accountantswith interim data, the nature of such involvement (especially, whetherthat involvement is timely), and the estimated costs and benefits leadingto that decision;(4) Cost and benefit considerations regarding whether reports are issuedto the registrant by the independent accountant and whether such reportsare then included by the registrant in its filings with the Commission;(5) The impact the performance of timely reviews has had on the cost andefficiency of the annual audit procedures; and (6) Experiences of independent accountants with the cost and benefit considerationsof the various registrant groups described above in determining the timingand nature of procedures to be performed. In addition to comments regarding the experience of registrants and theirauditors with existing requirements, the Commission is also inviting commentthat would provide any other information that could be useful in estimatingthe incremental costs and benefits of implementing a recommendation fortimely reviews of interim date.\4\\6\<NOTE/> For example, commentators might make projections regardingexpected costs and benefits of prospective implementation of the timelyreview requirement contemplated by this release. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\6\ Regarding costs of both existing and prospective interimreview requirements, one of the issues in which the Commission is interestedis the impact that timely reviews may have on the annual audit fee (<T3>i.e.</T3>, can it be expected that increased fees for timely reviewswill be offset, to some extent, by reductions in audit fees?). As discussed above, the Commission recognizes that certain registrantsmay include financial information for interim periods on other than a quarterlybasis. Therefore, comments also are requested regarding the incrementalcosts and benefits of applying any proposed rulemaking for timely reviewsto interim periods presented on other than a quarterly basis. The Commissionalso requests comment as to whether certain registrants, for example smaller,less widely-traded, or foreign registants, should be exempt from a requirementthat their independent accountant perform timely reviews of interim financialdata. B. Additional Matters That Should be Considered in Determining Whetherto Propose a Requirement for Timely Reviews <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Impact on Timely Release of Earnings </ITAG>The Commission requests comment on whether a requirement that registrantshave their independent accountants perform timely reviews of interim financialdata would delay registrants from promptly releasing earnings data to thepublic. The Commission also requests comments on whether there would bea resource limitation concerning the accountants' ability to perform timelyreviews, particularly in view of the high percentage of registrants withcalendar or calendar-quarter year-ends, and whether any such limitationwould materially affect the timing of the release of earnings data to thepublic. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Accountant Not Engaged to Perform Prior Year Audit </ITAG>The Commission requests comment on any incremental costs that may be incurredin complying with a potential requirement for timely reviews in those situationswhere the registrant changes auditors during the fiscal year. Commentsshould address whether this is expected to be a problem, provide an estimateof any additional costs a registrant may need to incur as a result of thenew accountant's need to establish sufficient knowledge to conduct a requiredtimely review, and discuss whether registrants may encounter difficultyin complying with such a requirement. The Commission is further interestedin whether there may be a need for specific guidance in these situations.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Adequacy of Procedures Performed by the Accountant </ITAG>As previously indicated, review procedures are substantially less in scopethan an examination in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.Specific comment is requested on (1) whether the procedures prescribedby SAS 36 provide the auditor with sufficient guidance regarding proceduresthat must be performed in order to conduct a timely review of interim financialinformation; (2) what additional procedures, if any, are necessary, andwhat they should entail; and (3) whether any such additional procedureswould increase total audit and interim review costs or merely have an impacton the timing of the performance of certain procedures. The Commission staff intends to take into consideration the comments receivedon this concept release in its further discussions with the Auditing StandardsBoard \4\\7\<NOTE/> on the matter of review procedures. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\7\ <T3>See </T3>note 24, <T3>supra</T3>. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Inclusion of Accountant's Report </ITAG>The Commission invites specific comments as to the effect that requiringinclusion of the accountant's SAS 36 report in the Form 10-Q and in registrationstatements that include interim information will have on the costs of thereview. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Potential for Over-Reliance on Review Reports </ITAG>The Commission requests comments as to the potential for over-relianceon a review report by users of financial information. Specific commentis also requested as to whether revisions should be made to the formatof the report to mitigate the potential risk of such over-reliance. Finally,as previously indicated, commentators should indicate whether additionalguidance for performing timely reviews would mitigate any such concerns.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Rule 436 Exemption </ITAG>The Commission is requesting comment on the relative costs and benefitsthat should be considered in assessing whether to maintain or rescind theliability exemption, if it proposes a requirement for timely reviews andreport issuance. C. Possible Revisions to Existing Disclosure Requirements and PossibleAlternatives to Required Timely Reviews The Commission requests comment on the changes regarding Item 302(a), ifany, that should be considered as part of its effort to enhance the involvementof independent accountants with quarterly information. In addition, regardlessof whether it proposes a requirement for timely reviews, the Commissionrequests comment on whether it would be useful to investors in analyzingoperating trends of issuers to have Item 302(a) data disclosed in initialpublic offerings under the Securities Act of 1933 and Form 10 \4\\8\<NOTE/> under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If such disclosurewere required, the Commission is interested in comments regarding the estimateof any incremental costs involved, including whether the auditor shouldbe required to review and issue a report on such data. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\8\ 17 CFR 249.210. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Solicitation of Comments </ITAG>The Commission invites comments on each of the above issues as well asany other matters that should be considered in deciding whether to proposeany amendments to its rules to improve the reliability of interim reporting,including a possible requirement that independent public accountant reviewquarterly financial data of registrants on a timely basis. <ITAG tagnum="20">By the Commission. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
