The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, and thepro-Syrian Amal militia continued to battle with mortars andmachine guns during the night, defying a new cease-fire called byIran and Syria.   Police said 12 people were killed and 40 wounded since thelatest truce was called at 11 p.m. (5 p.m. EDT) on Monday. It wasthe seventh cease-fire called since fighting broke out May 6 in the16-square-mile enclave.   The latest clash brought the casualty toll to 237 killed and 746wounded.   In other developments, unconfirmed reports said the Iranians andSyrians were working on a deal under which the Syrian army wouldnot try to free the hostages if its soldiers moved into the area.The United States indicated it would be willing to talk with thecaptors of the hostages in the slums.   Shell blasts and gunfire echoed across Beirut today. Police saidAmal, which has lost most of the territory it held in the region,mounted a counterattack to regain the sprawling Shiyah district.   ``Amal is pushing hard and Hezbollah is retreating in Shiyah fora second day,'' said a police spokesman who cannot be named understanding rules. ``But the fundamentalists remain in control of 90percent of the slums. Only the Syrians can crush them.''   The Syrians massed thousands of troops around the embattledenclave in the last two days, poising for a push to stop thefighting.   ``We're ready to go in, but zero hour has not been set yet,''said a Syrian colonel commanding the main highway to the airportfacing Hezbollah's strongholds.   The agreement to revive political efforts to end the battle wasreached in meetings held by Iran's acting Foreign Minister AliMohammed Besharati, government leaders and army officers inDamascus and Beirut on Monday.   ``The door is still open for political efforts,'' Syria'smilitary intelligence chief in Lebanon, Brig. Gen. Ghazi Kenaan,said after a one-hour meeting with Besharati.   But Kenaan stopped short of saying whether Syria would rescindits decision to send troops into the slums with shoot-to-killorders to separate and disarm the combatants.   ``That decision has been taken after all peaceful methods wereexhausted,'' Kenaan told reporters. ``But if there is a new hope tostop the bloodbath with political efforts, we'll give it a try.''   Besharati told reporters the talks with Kenaan were``positive.'' He did not elaborate beyond saying: ``I came tobandage the bleeding wounds of the suburbs.''   Christian-controlled radio stations said Besharati's talks werefocusing on a three-point deal:   _A pledge that the Syrians would not seek to free the 18 foreignhostages believed held by Hezbollah-affilated extremists in theslums. Nine Americans are believed to be among the hostages.   _Safety and freedom for an estimated 500 Iranian RevolutionaryGuards fighting alongside Hezbollah before the Syrians move in.   _Hezbollah as well as Amal would lay down arms provided they beallowed to function as unarmed political parties.   The report could not be independently verified. Besharati andthe Iranian Embassy refused to comment. Christian radio stationshave rarely been accurate on Moslem affairs.   Sheik Mohammed Mehdi Shamseddin, head of the Supreme ShiiteCouncil, the sect's highest religious body, reiterated today thatSyrian forces should move in. ``Every other method is just a wasteof time'' he said in a statement broadcast by Beirut radio stations.   The United States indicated on Monday it would be willing totalk with the captors of the hostages believed held in the slums.   State Department spokesman Charles Redman, asked about reportsthat the hostages had been moved from the slums, said: ``I don'thave anything to say about their whereabouts.''   He said Washington was pleased by a call from the spiritualguide of Hezbollah, Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, for talksabout the hostages.</TEXT></DOC>
