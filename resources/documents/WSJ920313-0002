Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi deputy prime minister, told the U.N.Security Council yesterday that Iraq is ready to renew thediscussions it previously broke off on the proposed emergencysale of its oil under U.N. supervision. &quot;We will enter intoserious talks with the U.N. secretariat to export an amountof Iraqi oil to secure the human and basic needs of the Iraqipeople,&quot; he said.</LP><TEXT>   Crude oil futures slipped in New York and London on thenews, which renewed the possibility of Iraqi oil flowing intoworld oil markets again soon -- but only briefly. Prices notonly recovered but rallied sharply in late-day trading onboth the New York Mercantile Exchange and on theInternational Petroleum Exchange in London.   In U.S. futures trading, crude oil for April delivery rose33 cents a barrel to settle at $18.83 a barrel. In London,Brent crude futures prices were 15 cents to 30 cents a barrelhigher.   One reason for the rally was that Mr. Aziz made clearafter his statement that Iraq wasn't retreating from itsprior opposition to the original terms of the proposed Iraqioil sale. He said that Iraq doesn't want the sale governed bya rigid U.N. resolution that would amount to &quot;interference inthe internal affairs of Iraq.&quot;   In a resolution six months ago, the U.N. Security Councilhad offered to allow Iraq an emergency sale of $1.6 billionof its oil for humanitarian purposes but under tightrestrictions. Discussions regarding such a sale later wereheld between Iraqi and U.N. officials in Vienna. But Iraq'srepresentatives failed to show up for a second round of suchtalks scheduled for early February.   Yesterday, Mr. Aziz said Iraq was now prepared &quot;to go intoan open dialogue&quot; toward arrangements for the exporting ofits oil under U.N. auspices. But he suggested Iraq sell itsoil to members of the Security Council, including the U.S.,which were its customers before the Persian Gulf War. Inturn, Iraq would buy food and medicines from these countriesso they could ensure the U.N. sanctions imposed during thePersian Gulf crisis were not violated.   According to Iraqi oil officials, they are prepared toexport oil in large volumes once the U.N. bans are lifted.&quot;We can easily export 1.5 million barrels a day without anypressure,&quot; Osama Abdul Razzak AlHiti, Iraq's oil minister,said in a recent interview.   Even if allowed by the U.N., however, such volumes wouldbe less than Iraq exported before the Persian Gulf crisisbegan in August 1990. Still, that amount of exports couldhave a major impact on world oil markets.   It would more than offset the total of the voluntaryoutput cuts -- 1.2 million barrels a day -- that 11 othermembers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countrieshave agreed to make for the second quarter to prop uppetroleum prices during this period of seasonally slackdemand.   Still, oil experts rule out any return of Iraq's oil toworld markets, even in modest amounts, before the thirdquarter, if then. The chief reason is that the U.S., Britainand most other members of the Security Council stoutly opposeany easing of sanctions against Iraq until the government ofSaddam Hussein complies with all the U.N.'s cease-firedemands. In this regard, the U.N. Security Council yesterdayagain charged that Iraq still hasn't complied with the U.N.requirements and must do so immediately. These demandsinclude destruction of all weapons, including facilities usedfor nuclear and chemical weapons.</TEXT></DOC>
