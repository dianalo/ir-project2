(Services).andO;Topic:     OutsourcingMISManagement of EDPSupport Services.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Outsourcing is a new buzzword in the computer industry.andP;  What exactly isoutsourcing?andP;  Chances are that if you ask four people you'll get fourdifferent answers.andP;  Some say it usually involves facilities management.andO;Others say it's network-related.andP;  Still others match outsourcing withapplications development or control of MIS.andM;All of them are right!andP;  The term outsourcing can be used in conjunction withany project or task not done internally.andP;  In simpler times we called thissubcontracting.andP;  Outsourcing means that a company goes &quot;outside&quot; for theknowledge and experience required to do a specific job.andM;In the service and support area we can apply the outsourcing concept tonetwork support, facilities management, disaster recovery, education andtraining, ongoing maintenance and a host of other service products.andP;  We canexpand it to include professional services such as data center design andconstruction, relocation services, systems, integration, account managementand other big-ticket support items that businesses accomplish by turning tooutside sources.andM;Outsourcing is expected to grow rapidly over the next few years.andP;  Service andsupport vendors see it as a way to replace hardware service revenueshortfalls.andP;  The Ledgeway Group/Dataquest, a market research firm, projectsthat the professional services/system integration market, which representsservice and support opportunities for outsourcing, will grow by 15.5 percentper year to $35.8 billion by 1994.andP;  This will occur at a time whentraditional hardware service worldwide is projected to decline from today's57 percent of service and support revenues to 49.6 percent by 1994.andP;  In theU.S., hardware service revenues are forecast to decline from today's 48.2percent of the service pie to only 40.8 percent in 1994.andM;Benefits And PitfallsandM;These figures show that becoming an outsourcing provider promises financialbenefits.andP;  But what's in it for the customer -- the one who outsources aproject or task?andM;Customers turn to outsourcing to improve performance and reduce costs.andO;Today's business environment puts pressure on executives to reduce overheadand improve the return on investment.andP;  One major step toward accomplishingthis is to reduce costly and personnel-intensive information system functionsby outsourcing selected tasks.andP;  This frees in-house personnel to focus on thecompany's core business rather than MIS business.andM;Outsourcing also offers solutions to a number of internal problems such as ashortage of in-house skills; high overhead (head count and expenses)associated with projects or tasks outside the company's core business; andunacceptable lead time to complete a project using company personnel.andO;Service and support customers look to outsourcing as a means of findingsolutions to these problems.andM;Like everything else in business, however, there are risks involved inoutsourcing.andP;  Customers must be concerned about costs exceeding the quotedprice, loss of control over projects and schedules, the technical competenceof the supplier, and the possibility of a support vendor going out ofbusiness during a job.andP;  In-house personnel may also be alienated if they viewoutsourcing as a reflection on their work or management's lack of confidencein their abilities.andM;To guard against an outsourcing calamity, you should insist on a fixed-pricecontract for services, although this may not be feasible in all situations.andO;For computing solution projects, you should control key vendor personnelworking on your task and have an option to cancel during a designated timespan.andP;  You should also be sure that the contract spells out performance-levelguarantees and the remedies if they aren't met.andP;  It's also a good idea toagree up-front on the level of ongoing support after task completion.andM;Careful selection of an outsourcing vendor will help you avoid some of thepitfalls.andP;  Key evaluation criteria include the vendor's reputation as well asknowledge and experience.andP;  A check of the vendor's financial condition canprovide a solid indication of whether or not it will be around to completeand later support the project.andP;  Other considerations such as proximity of thevendor to your site and the attitude of its personnel should be weighedcarefully before the vendor's price tag is factored into the decision.andM;Outsourcing with DECandM;DEC has major programs in place to provide service and support solutions forcustomers who want to outsource business support services or MIS integrationfunctions.andP;  According to Nigel Bufton, a DEC business planning and marketingmanager, examples of the projects DEC handles include worldwide rollouts,final assembly and testing, facilities management, and network and siteservices (integrating, management and preparation).andP;  Other outsourcingdirectly related to field service and support includes logistic services(parts inventory, delivery, and so on), multivendor services coordination,recovery services contingency planning and ongoing maintenance.andM;&quot;All services are available for DEC environments and multivendor sites,&quot;states Bufton.andP;  &quot;DEC, in turn, may outsource some of the solutions tosubcontractors, business partners and allies.andP;  But DEC remains responsible tothe customer for all support and services under the program.&quot;andM;DEC sometimes outsource to &quot;partners&quot; such projects as cable-pulling activityon networks, maintenance of non-DEC hardware and upgrades to third-partydevices.andP;  Service for copy machines, laboratory equipment and other machinerymay also be coordinated by DEC at the customer's request.andM;When outsourcing, DEC looks for quality OEMs and TPMs and lets them bidcompetitively.andP;  DEC's program provides the customer with one telephone numberfor all maintenance activities.andP;  Sometimes end-user support is included inthe agreement.andP;  DEC coordinates all service and support functions and paysall subcontractor bills.andP;  It then submits one invoice for all services underthe support integration program.andP;  Bufton states, &quot;We're the only point ofcontact the customer ever needs for everything under this program.&quot;andM;Other OEMs and independent service and support providers offer similarprograms.andP;  And supplementary program options are being added all the time.andO;But few are as international in scope or as complete in types of support asthat offered by DEC.andM;If you're considering outsourcing as a solution to a business need, lookclosely at various options from a number of suppliers and at the total costinvolved before plunging in.andP;  While programs such as DEC's offer convenientone-party responsibility, complete coordination of all activities and oneinvoice for all services, this isn't the main reason for outsourcing.andM;The benefits you derive from outsourcing should focus on performanceimprovement and/or cost reduction.andP;  By bringing in outside expertise to dealwith specific functions, the knowledge and experience of the supplier becomean instant asset, enhance performance levels and should therefore result in ashorter lead time to reach your goal.andP;  It should allow internal management todevote more of its time to te core business and the company's future.andM;Outsourcing prevents you from having to hire additional personnel and addfacility space that may not be needed after the project is complete.andP;  Andoutsourcing allows you to place more emphasis on your primary business byfreeing personnel, time and money from MIS and other activities.andP;  Butoutsourcing doesn't mean surrendering control and internal responsibility ofsubcontracted functions and projects to outside vendors.andP;  Smart managementavoids this pitfall.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
