Eastern President Phil Bates, in a New York news conference afterthe company filed for protection from its creditors under bankruptcylaws, accused the National Mediation Board of throwing ``allpretense of neutrality to the wind'' in trying to mediate the17-month dispute.   After more than a year of talks with the airline and itsInternational Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers local,the two-member board said it couldn't resolve the dispute and askedPresident Bush to create an emergency panel that would have delayeda strike by up to 60 days. Bush refused and the machinists went onstrike Saturday.   Bates accused the board of keeping the company locked up in ``afruitless, destructive mediation process'' while the airline'slosses grew.   ``It is regrettable that Eastern's management made adversecomments about the board,'' said Charles R. Barnes, the executivedirector of the board, which mediates transportation industry labordisputes. ``But I'm sure in hindsight that the parties will concludethat the board acted professionally, impartially and in fullaccordance with the legal responsibilities.''   In a statement, the board said the dispute, in which Easternoriginally asked for $200 million in salary cuts while the unionsought $50 million in raises, was one of the most complex the boardhas had to mediate since the airline industry was deregulated in1978.   ``Eastern's bankruptcy filing is unfortunate for the carrier, itsemployees, the traveling public and the nation's transportationsystem,'' the board said.   Board spokesman David Bushnell said mediators continued to talkwith both the union and the company but had not managed to bring thetwo sides together since the walkout.</TEXT></DOC>
