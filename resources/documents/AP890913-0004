And everybody thinks theyhave it when they leave the store,'' said Miles Turnquist, the ownerof a 7-Eleven in Truckee near the north shore of Lake Tahoe about 30miles west of Reno, Nev.   Sales for the 7:58 p.m. televised drawing averaged $1.73 millionan hour Wednesday, totaling $12.1 million between 6 a.m. and 1 p.m.as Californians and a fair number of Nevadans bought chances on therollover jackpot that hasn't been won since Aug. 26, Lotteryofficials said.   Sales Tuesday in the Lotto 6-46 game topped $17 million and $9.9million worth of $1 tickets were purchased Sunday and Monday.   Players pick six numbers from 1 to 49 in the twice-a-week game.The winning numbers picked in Wednesday's drawing were 02, 32, 21,11, 28, 19 and the bonus number, to determine a larger jackpot forfive-of-six winners, was 27. The winner, if any, was to be announcedThursday.   The chance of winning: 1 in 14 million. Big winners get theirprizes in 20 annual installments.   The all-time California jackpot record was $61.98 million on Oct.29, 1988, with sales that day of $39.8 million, Lottery spokesmanJohn Schaade said. Holders of three winning tickets split the take.   The largest U.S. lottery jackpot ever was given away in thePennsylvania lottery on April 26, 1989, when $115 million was splitby 14 winning tickets.   On Wednesday, a ``Lotto Fever Management Team'' tried to makesure there would be no glitches at the 7,900 retailers around thestate where tickets are sold.   ``All systems are go so far,'' said Lottery spokeswoman CarolineWalker, who added, ``Better knock on wood.''   Many did around the state, from traditional high-volume sellerWills Fargo Country Store in Baker to specialty shops in affluentBeverly Hills.   ``We're midway between Las Vegas and Barstow,'' Steve Zwerner,general manager of the country store in the Southern Californiadesert near the Nevada line, said Tuesday. ``You have to go rightthrough us to get to Vegas. Many of them just came, bought theirtickets and got back to Vegas.''   Even the rich get Lotto fever, said Beverly Hills tobacconistCharlie Kornguth.   Kornguth said he sells $4,000 and $5,000 worth of Lotto ticketswith random, computer-selected numbers to many well-heeledcustomers. He said he once issued $11,000 in tickets to ``a man whowon zero, zilch, nothing.''   John Kaiser, managing partner of the Satellite Mrket in Orange,said many of his customers eschewed random picks for birthdays,anniversaries and Los Angeles Dodgers' numbers.   ``I know one guy who uses the date he got divorced,'' Kaiser said.</TEXT></DOC>
