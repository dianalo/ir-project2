The White House indicated that President Bush may sendSecretary of State James Baker on another Middle East trip.And it didn't rule out the possibility of talks between Mr.Baker and Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein.</LP><TEXT>   Meanwhile, France announced that it has sent an officialto Iraq on a surprise &quot;exploratory mission.&quot; Also, ministersof the European Community were preparing for an emergencymeeting in Luxembourg tomorrow to consider sending their ownrepresentative to Iraq for talks with Saddam Hussein.   After these developments, crude oil for February deliverysettled $1.95 lower at $26.49 a barrel on the New YorkMercantile Exchange. The March contract was down $1.90 to$25.90 a barrel.   &quot;The overall market was down because of fresh hopes that anegotiated settlement can be arranged in the Gulf crisis,&quot;said Peter Beutel, director of the energy group at PegasusEconometric. Technical factors accelerated the selling onceit began, he said.   Prices of fuels also plunged, with heating oil leading theway in the U.S. and Europe. In U.S. futures trading, heatingoil for February delivery fell 5.90 cents a gallon to 73.30cents. February gasoline was down 3.26 cents a gallon to68.10 cents.   Analysts said sluggish demand resulting from theunseasonably warm winter so far and a rise in inventories arecontributing to the weak market for heating oil. &quot;It has beenwarm, and the inventories are very high,&quot; said Robert B.Greenes, a heating oil consultant and executive vicepresident of the New York Oil Heating Association.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: An offer from China to buy 600,000metric tons of wheat under the U.S. government's export bonusplan boosted wheat futures prices and also pulled corn andsoybean futures prices off their intraday lows. Wheat futuresprices gained additional support from reports ofweather-related damage to winter wheat crops in certain areasover the past few days, said Robert Lekberg, a futuresanalyst with Farmers Grain andamp; Livestock in Chicago. Wheatfutures for March delivery on the Chicago Board of Tradeclosed three cents a bushel higher at $2.6350. News of theChina offer, which was carried by wire services at about12:40 p.m. CST, triggered a flurry of activity in the Boardof Trade's grain trading room. While wheat futures pricesmoved into positive territory, March corn future pricesrallied from a modest loss at one point to close unchanged at$2.3175 a bushel. China's purchase plans helped soybeanfutures prices bounce off their lows, analysts said, butMarch soybean futures still closed 7.5 cents a bushel lowerat $5.6725. Futures analysts said soybean futures prices werebeing depressed by widespread expectations that farmers willbe planting more soybeans this year than last. The increasein production is likely to be fueled partly by theAgriculture Department's recent decision to let farmersqualify for price support payments if they take out ofproduction only 7.5% of their land earmarked for soybeansthis year, analysts said. Earlier estimates put the setasidelevel at 10% for soybeans, the analysts added.                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures for March delivery rose 2.45 cents a poundto $1.193. According to John Gross, president of J.E. Gross andamp;Associates and publisher of the Copper Journal, the currentrally began on Friday with a three-cent gain and continuedMonday with a rise of 2.75 cents more. &quot;I believe thisupswing is due to buying by commodity funds, most of whichare trend-followers,&quot; Mr. Gross said. He noted that thetechnical resistance the market had shown at $1.12 was easilyovercome on Friday, setting the stage for the continuation ofthe rally. Mr. Gross said the current run-up is puzzling,considering the soft state of the economy. He noted thatcopper stocks in Comex warehouses are still relatively lowand continue to remain below the levels of last July. But hecautioned that if copper dealers, merchants and users don'tjoin this rally, it will be short-lived. In such acircumstance, he explained, commodity funds probably wouldquickly abandon their purchases and perhaps even sell somecontracts short in hopes of buying them back at lower prices.                                                                                                          SUGAR: The March futures contract ended 0.25 cent a poundlower at 9.12 cents, after reaching a new low of 9.02 cents.Erik Dunlaevy, sugar trader at Balfour Maclaine Internationalin New York, said the sugar market is correcting the effectsof an unjustified rally. That rally began Dec. 26 when theLondon market was closed but the New York market continued totrade higher on low volume. Traders who bought during thatrally have been selling out their positions and puttingpressure on the market, according to Mr. Dunlaevy. Last yeararound this time &quot;white,&quot; or refined, sugar went to a premiumof $110 a metric ton over raw sugar. Currently that premiumis only $90. &quot;Traders expected that the white sugar marketwould support the price of raw sugar, but it hasn't,&quot; Mr.Dunlaevy said. He noted that a war in the Middle East isconsidered by traders to be bearish for several reasons. Henoted that a war would undoubtedly raise world-wide oceanfreight rates that would price some marginal buyers out ofthe market. &quot;It would also raise their cost for energysupplies, thereby reducing funds available to buy othercommodities,&quot; according to Mr. Dunlaevy. Though there isn'tmuch sugar around currently, he added, there are even fewerbuyers for the limited supplies.                                                                                                          ORANGE JUICE: The March futures contract fell by themaximum permissible amount of five cents a pound to $1.1115.The January contract, which has no price restrictions,plunged 8.15 cents to $1.0535. Judith Ganes, orange juiceanalyst at Merrill Lynch Futures in New York, said the marketwas hit by a number of factors, including &quot;the realizationthat the holiday period was over without a hint of freezingtemperatures in the orange-producing regions of Florida.&quot;Moreover, the California freeze is expected to increasesupplies as damaged fruit that would have gone to the freshmarket is processed for juice. Ms. Ganes noted that retailprices still don't reflect the decline in wholesale pricesthat took place last year. When they finally do, she added,currently lackluster retail demand should increase. Ms. Ganessaid she expects futures to set new contract lows for Januaryand March delivery. Chris Douma of Layton Commodities, amajor player in the orange juice market, said that at theclose of trading yesterday there was a pool of about 300March contracts, 75 May contracts and about 40 July contractsoffered for sale at each contract's lowest permissible price.</TEXT></DOC>
