 As a result, ashardware prices and performance change, MIS managers are finding they cannottake advantage of new technologies because they are incompatible with thecurrent DBMS.andM;MIS managers are increasingly solving this problem by implementingfourth-generation languages (4GLs) that support multiple databases and allowa sing applicant to access data from any database on which it resides.andM;Speed and ease of development are essential for organizations that depend ondatabase technology: These factors can help reduce application backlog.andP;  Manyorganizations now realize that the integration of information from varioussources within the company leads to better, more timely decisions.andM;But spees and ease of development are difficult to achieve when data andfiles from different departments are managed by different DBMSes.andP;  Adopting amultidatabase 4GL will enable an MIS department to support corporatestrategic needs and simultaneously enhance its own prodictivity.andM;Many managers avoid using 4GLs as anything more than report writers becauseof high initial costs in terms of time, labor and money.andP;  Even in thislimited role, the return on investment in a 4GL that supports multipledatabases can be both large and rapid.andM;For example, a savings and loan institution was ordered to generate a repotfrom incompatible databases to submit to the government within one month orface a substantial fine.andP;  The institution's MIS department initiallydetermined that it would take two months to develop the report.andP;  By workingwith a 4GL providing multiple database interfaces, however, the data wasaccessed and a report was generated in about a week.andP;  The Sandamp;L paid $150,000for its 4GL, but avoided a $1.k million fine.andM;A company that spent $6k,000 for a multidatabase 4GL to run on a midrange.andO;VAX discovered, after combining data from two dissimilar DBMSes, that it wasoverordering about $1 million worth of products annually.andP;  This overstock wasresulting in the loss of 10 percent annual interest on that amount, or$100,000--thus justifying the purchase of the 4GL as well as approximatelyone man-year of development time.andM;The heterogeneity of many VAX sites means that managers of DEC systems arefrequently confronted with requirements for retrieving information via VTterminals, workstations, PCs and Macintoshes, and the latter three mightoperate in a client/server mode with their own front end.andM;THE PC-VAX CONNECTIONandM;According to a study conducted by the MIS department of Williams College inWilliamstown, Mass., the PC-VAX combination is one of the least expensiveroutes to take due to the fact that a 4GL on a PC that accesses a database ona VAX constitutes one of the most cost-effective platforms on which a 4GL canbe implemented.andP;  Per-user costs are significantly lower for this option thanfor others.andP;  (See &quot;Orchestrating the lowest 4GL costs,&quot; above.)andM;These figures were based on the cost of a MicroVAX II, PCs, the number ofprinters received by each configuration and the necessary 4GL, software.andP;  Forthe PC server configurations, costs were somewhat higher because theprocessing power of the server is dedicated solely to supporting thedatabase, and is not available for other applications.andP;  By comparison, thestudy found that supporting a PC-based 4GL application would require between25 percent and 30 percent of the VAX's CPU time, Leaving much of itscomputing power free to support other requirements.andM;According to the study, the advantage of using PCs and a VAX is the abilityto expand applications from one plotform to another as they grow in size, andthe ability to combine local data and information stored on remote databaseson the VAX.andM;For products that operate on both PCs and a VAX, spreading the processingload across the two systems can cut costs from $8,300 pere user for 10 usersto $2,500 per user in a 50-user enviroment.andP;  Similarly, 4GLs that run solelyon the VAX exhibit a per-user cost that decreases significantly as sizeincreases, from $9,500 per user for a 10-user system to about $3,000 per userfor a 50-user system.andM;In contrast, for a system running on a PC and employing a PC server, costsrange from $6,000 per user for a 10-user system to about $4,000 per user fora 50-user system.andP;  In this case, the processing power of the servr cannot beused for purposes other than attending to the needs of the PC database.andM;The Williams College study also shows that by implementing 4GLs on PCs alone,an MIS manager will face much higher costs for support and maintenance thanif the implementation is carried out using the VAX.andM;Accessing databases like Oracle and Ingres through a multivendor 4GL requiresthat the 4GL have a separate interface for each database.andP;  In addition, someapplications require access to database information stored on RMS files.andO;Other requirements might include a report generator, query processor andapplication generator.andM;Most 4GLs provide an interface through DBMS-specific modules that translatethe application's function into a call in the DBMS' implementation of SQL orother query language.andM;For example, one 4GL design includes a &quot;database switch&quot; layer.andP;  When anapplication function passes through this layer, the database to which it isdirected is noted and the function is routed to the correct database module.andO;At that point, the function is translated into the DBMS-specific commandsneccessary to manipulate the data.andM;Much of this process is compiled with the application, eliminating theperformance degradation that would result from the need to perform areal-time translation of the commands.andM;Although code generators most often create command sequences, somemultidatabase 4GLs let the programmer write code in the database's nativelanguage within the 4GL application.andP;  Although this facility requires moreprogrammer time, it also permits applications to be tweaked for specifictasks or environments, improving application performance.andM;COSTS VS.andP;  SAVINGSandM;According to research by Atre Computer Assistance, a division of Coopers andamp;Lybrand of Rye, N.Y., costs for 4GLs range from $15,000 for MicroVAXes to$150,000 for VAX 9000-series systems.andP;  Installation, training and maintenancecost extra.andM;For example, a $60,000 4GL license would entail an additional 15 percentmaintenance charge of $9,000 per year, according to Atre.andP;  Training wouldtake about two to three days per person at about $500 per day when performedon-site by a vendor or consultant.andM;Thus, training for 20 programmer/developers (at fully burdened salaries of$45,000 per year; or $180 per day) for three days each would amount to about$12,300.andP;  Total first-year costs would reach $81,300.andM;Return on investment can be calculated by figuring the above in conjuunctionwith the costs of development time and the benefits of new applicationsresulting from multivendor database access capabilities.andM;If, for instance, a developer earning a fully burdened $45,000 per yearspends 3 man-months on an application which would allow access across the VAXto Oracle and Progress databases, development costs would amount to $11,250.andO;Fifty managers, each earning a fully burdened $45,000, could save eight dayseach per year by producing their own reports and bypassing the dataprocessing department.andP;  Annual savings would be $72,000.andM;Quantitative advantages can also be gained.andP;  For example, if these managerscan generate marketing strategies based on information combined from thecompany's sales and finance databases, factors such as time to market orinventory adjustments could improve quickly.andM;Tracking orders from sales to delivery, despite differing databases, isanother area with savings potential.andP;  Sales orders must be tracked carefully.andO;If they are not fulfilled in timely fashion, customer satisfaction suffers.andM;Or, as mentioned earlier a company might overorder certain items, tying up ininventory money that could be better invested elsewhere.andM;In sum, managers must continually monitor the pulse of a business.andP;  A 4GLcould enable them to do that.andM;THE OTHER SIDE OF THE 4GLandM;There is a downside to the universal 4GL.andP;  Fourth-generation languages thatlet end users program simple applications might cause the proliferation ofsmall, poorly maintained personal applications that could adversely affectcorporate databases.andP;  In addition to the danger of database corruption, theseend users might also require more training or support to maintain theirapplications.andM;A proliferation of applications can also eat up CPU cycles and storage,forcing MIS to speed up or implement upgrade plans.andM;Resource consumption will also be high if 4GLs are used for large programs.andO;In such cases, 4GLs should be interpreted into lower-level languages to avoidwasting system time.andM;On a larger scale, MIS managers must carefully evaluate the pitfalls ofnegotiating between different database cultures, when members of each culturemight have vested interests in maintaining certain procedures.andM;Finally, in some cases it is simpler and faster to produce new code fromscratch instead of trying to decipher and work from old code.andM;Perhaps one of the most significant blessings wrought by multidatabase 4GLsis their ability to ease the pain of reverse-engineering databases, a taskthat many MIS departments are only reluctantly beginning to undertake.andM;Although CASE tools are employed to perform the actual reverse engineering, a4GL supporting multiple DBMSes will allow applications to be shifted to thenew schema without significant difficulties.andM;Another advantage is that older 3GL applications will benefit from the directintervention of 4GL tools, taking the application and giving it a 4GL&quot;face-lift.&quot;andM;The first step in such a process is to identify the age of the application tobe replaced; the older the code, the bigger the likely return on investment.andO;For example, an applications program that has been run for 10 to 15 yearswithin a company is probably written in a SGL, and might have reached thepoint where every change introduces new, unexpected problems.andM;Maintenance is likely to be difficult because the code is cryptic and hard todecipher.andP;  By rewriting it in a 4GL, a company can save substantialmaintenance costs.andM;After the code's age is determined, its logic must be identified andevaluated, breaking down each function and its relationships to otherfunctions within the application, thereby creating a dataflow diagram.andM;Then the code must be verified.andP;  Atre Computer Assistance recommends keepingthe old module in place but inactive, then running the test data in asituation where the results are known beforehand.andP;  If the tested gets thedesired results, the code should then be run by someone who has neverpreviously run the program in order to further test the data.andM;Atre also recommends keeping an old module for three to four months after themodule for three to four months after the new one has been installed.andP;  Thecompany also warns that most crashes will occur when the program is opened orclosed.andM;DEEP SEATED CODE TERRORandM;Despite the benefits, most companies have not yet begun developing newschemas for older database implementations.andP;  Atre suggests that suchorganizations are simply terrified to touch existing code, no matter howbadly it runs.andP;  Most choose to build a new system alongside the old one, thenthrow the older one away.andM;It is imperative to select an appropriate 4GL, regardless of whether it isused for reengineering or new development.andP;  The code generator facility is acrucial component of a true 4GL.andP;  Although a 4GL without a code generator canmake programming easier, the productivity gains of a code generator arehigher.andM;A report by the Gartner Group, a consulting company in Stamford, Conn.,andO;showed that at the time of purchase, a code generator for a 3GL directlyaffects 20 percent of the overall work performed in systems development.andO;Such a code generator is likely to improve productivity by 20 to 30 percent,resulting in about a 5 percent gain overall.andP;  This is approximately the samegain that users could expect from a 4GL.andM;Thus, organizations already using a code generator to enhance 3GLproductivity can expect minimal additional gains from a 4GL unless it cansupport multiple databases.andM;Gartner uses the example of a fully burdened developer cost of $65,000 peryear, and estimates savings of about $3,000 per developer per year.andP;  Afteradjusting for the cost of training and learning time (2 weeks each), Gartnerestimates a productivity break-even point of 1 1/2 years, excluding the costsof product acquisition, installation and operation.andM;Maintenance is another area where savings can accrue from the use of 4GLs.andO;According to Gartner, it is reasonable to assume that maintenance costs canbe reduced by 50 percent when programs are maintained through the codegenerator.andM;Gartner cautions, however, that there are problems: The first round ofprojects could take 12 to 18 months while programmers ramp up to using thenew system.andM;But if 20 percent of the original development resource is allotted tomaintenance when the project is completed and a 50 percent programmingproductivity increase is realized, Gartner claims the user will achieve a net2 percent labor cost savings within 1 1/2 to 3 years, yielding net presentvalue savings of $870 per developer.andM;The maintenance savings are cumulative, providing even greater advantages astime goes on.andM;Overall, it pays for MIS managers to commit to using 4GLs.andP;  In a survey ofsystems development directors conducted by Index Group, a managementconsulting company in Cambridge, Mass., two of the top five concerns of MISmanagers this year are applications development and the integration andsharing of data.andP;  A third concern involves constructing the means forspanning departmental information systems.andM;These issues can be addressed at least partially by a 4GL that can accessdata from disparate databases.andP;  However, the report also noted that usersseldom cooperate in cross-functional projects and that despite 4GL end-userprogramming attempts, most development is still performed by professionals.andM;Further, professional developers and end-user developers finds workingtogether difficult, often because each lacks a basic understanding of theconcepts and tasks the others apply to their daily work.andM;Finally, 72 percent of the companies surveyed lack effective trainingprograms for requirements analysis and business problem-solving.andP;  If notaddressed, these areas can create problems for implementing the multivendordatabase 4GL despite the technical soundness of the decision.andM;The ideal 4GL can operate in an integrated development environment, offermultivendor database support, support different user interfaces and providefor cooperative processing where data can be speedily offloaded from thehost.andM;MIS managers would do well to invest in a 4GL that allows multivendordatabase access and reverse engineering, but only if they take the time andcare necessary to ensure that users properly employ the new capabilities.andM;Merger invites combined databasesandM;The merger of Murky Research and Deep Consulting, two fictitious marketresearch and consulting companies, has left the MIS director of the new Deepandamp; Murky Research Inc. in a quandary.andP;  The critical databases of each companyuse dissimilar DBMSes, and somehow he must find a way to merge the data aswell as the staffs.andM;As he examines his situation, the MIS manager figures he can choose one DBMSas the standard for the merged company, rewriting applications and importingdata to the other DBMS.andM;On the other hand, he can purchase a 4GL that he can use to develop a wholenew suite of applications to support both databases.andP;  In addition to theproductivity gain, the MIS manager figures that he will avoid the problem ofbeing locked into a single DBMS in the future.andM;The cost of such a 4GL is about $75,000 for his VAXcluster, and thedevelopment of the systems will take about two man-years.andM;On the other hand, he figures that by using a 4GL, he will save the cost oftwo programmers annually over the next five years, a sum that includes thecost of rewriting code from one DBMS to the other and porting the data fromone database to the other.andP;  The MIS manager will also avoid paying higherlabor costs, which he calculates will rise at 5 percent annually.andM;Over a five-year period, his income, in terms of productivity gains andcost-avoidance, comes to $386,794, and his expenses come to $90,000 fordevelopment.andM;After discounting his cash flow on the deal by 11 percent, the MIS managerconcludes that he will net $51,515 over the five-year period, achieving areturn on investment in the middle of the third-year.andP;  His internal rate ofreturn amounts to a healty 31.1 percent.andM;Thus, the MIS manager concludes that the move to a multidatabase 4GL is asmart one for Deep andamp; Murky Research.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
