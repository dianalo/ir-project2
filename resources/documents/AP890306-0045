He said Israel was negotiating with the Palestine LiberationOrganization through the United Nations for a halt to guerrillaoperations from south Lebanon, the papers reported.   Israel has said it will not talk to the PLO, which it considers aterrorist organization.   Arafat was quoted as saying that reviving the short-lived 1981cease-fire, which was mediated by U.N. peacekeepers, ``should onlytake place according to our conditions.''   In an interview with editors of several Kuwaiti dailies, hestressed that the PLO would agree to a truce only if Israel ``stopsits raids in the region, ends its deportation of Palestinians andstops using arms against the uprising'' in the occupied West Bankand Gaza Strip.   Under the 1981 accord, the PLO suspended operations across theLebanese border as diplomatic efforts were made to resolve theArab-Israeli conflict. The truce fell apart when the Israelisinvaded Lebanon in 1982.   Arafat's reported offer came after Israeli claims that recentguerrilla operations in Israel's self-designated ``security zone''in south Lebanon violated the renunciation of terrorism Arafat madelast December, when he also recognized Israel's right to exist.   The United States lifted a 13-year-old ban on direct talks withthe PLO following Arafat's declaration and has said guerrilla raidson Israel could have a negative effect on the U.S.-PLO dialogue thatbegan three months ago.   The Israelis regularly retaliate for the cross-border raids fromLebanon with air strikes and ground assaults.   Arafat was quoted today as saying: ``I can go to Israel only ifmy trip is endorsed by all Arabs.'' He was also quoted as predictingthat ``an independent Palestinian state will be set up within twoyears.''   During the 15-month rebellion against Palestinian rule in theWest Bank and Gaza Strip, Israeli authorities have shot to deathmore the 380 Palestinians and deported dozens. More than 15 Israelishave died.   Arafat, who arrived in Kuwait Saturday, presided over the annualmeeting of the Palestinian National Fund.</TEXT></DOC>
