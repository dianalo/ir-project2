Indeed, many taxpayers are starting to realize they will need more folders in the home file cabinet than ever because of the 1986 tax overhaul. &quot;We're going to become a nation of bookkeepers,&quot; gripes Warren Shine, a tax specialist in New York with the accounting firm of Ernst andamp; Whinney.    New on 1987 returns, for instance, was Form 8606 for reporting nondeductible contributions to individual retirement accounts. The Internal Revenue Service says taxpayers must save those forms until all funds are withdrawn from the tax-deferred savings plans. That could mean 50 years or more for a 30-year-old. &quot;If you contribute to a nondeductible IRA, you become a record-keeper for life,&quot; Mr. Shine says.    Meanwhile, many people found in preparing their 1987 returns that they must keep more numerous or more detailed records than before to calculate -- and if necessary, justify in an audit -- the figures they'll report on future returns. To wit:   Restrictions on deducting certain types of interest expense -- such as on auto loans and other personal financing -- require new records on where borrowed funds are deposited and how and when they're spent.    All taxpayers must report interest earned from tax-exempt bonds, even though that income is used to calculate federal tax only in special cases, such as for some Social Security recipients.    Unreimbursed business expenses must be tracked separately for travel -- which remains 100% deductible above the &quot;miscellaneous&quot; deductions threshold -- and for meals and entertainment, of which only a maximum 80% now can be written off. (Miscellaneous expenses are deductible to the extent they exceed 2% of adjusted gross income.)    And investors who weren't allowed to deduct all their 1987 losses from tax shelters or other &quot;passive&quot; investments must keep detailed records of those disallowed sums for use in future years.    &quot;The amount of paper (in client files) has increased by probably 20% just in keeping track of the suspended losses on tax shelters,&quot; says Dawn B. McNerney, a tax specialist with Cohen andamp; Co., a Cleveland accounting firm. She sees &quot;shades of Big Brotherism&quot; as taxpayers must report information that doesn't affect their current year's tax bill -- such as tax-exempt earnings and, on Form 8606, total IRA account balances.    IRS spokesman Wilson Fadely responds that the new disclosures were mandated by Congress to help the IRS monitor and encourage compliance with tax rules.    Of course, some taxpayers found their record-keeping simplified by the 1986 act. With sales tax no longer deductible, for instance, itemizers don't need to save every $2 and $3 sales receipt to get the maximum deduction. But for those affected by new provisions such as restrictions on deducting interest, the new hassles far outweigh the ease of not saving sales slips.    Some accountants fret about driving clients away with demands for more data. Stuart Kessler, senior tax partner at Goldstein, Golub, Kessler andamp; Co. in New York, asks some clients to keep diaries to justify the tax status for sideline ventures. &quot;At what point are they going to say forget it, we'll go to someone who doesn't require this?&quot; he wonders.    Accountants are requiring more documentation partly because preparers of deficient returns must pay steep penalties. &quot;In the past, if a guy said $2,000 for entertainment, we put $2,000 down,&quot; says Edward Mendlowitz of Siegel, Mendlowitz andamp; Rich in New York. &quot;Now we won't do it unless he has a diary or gives us a signed statement backing it up.&quot;    Nashville, Tenn., accountant Bernie D. Goldstein says such demands have changed the relationship of accountant and client: &quot;We're not like an Internal Revenue agent by any means . . . but we're no longer just the agent of the client.&quot;    Still, those piles of papers are often the key to surviving an audit. Mr. Goldstein has seen clients with well-organized records -- but &quot;where I suspected their veracity&quot; -- sail through audits without additional tax being imposed.    Not so for some clients who had lousy records but wouldn't lie about a dime. &quot;Those,&quot; he says, &quot;are the people who have to pay more tax.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
