Pierce, who heads the regional committee, cautioned that someremaining local issues could be stumbling blocks as serious asthose resolved regionally. ``We have miles to go before we sleep,''he said.   Bargaining was to resume Wednesday. The union has agreed to aself-imposed deadline of midnight Friday for negotiating regionaland local issues. Eleven committees are discussing local issues.   Any tentative agreement would have be ratified by Monday, whichwould be the earliest time employees could come back to work.   ``We are happy that we have this understanding and we feel thatit is a fair settlement,'' said John Bonomo, a NYNEX spokesman.   The CWA, representing 40,000 workers at New York Telephone, and20,000 International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers members atNew England Telephone struck parent NYNEX on Aug. 6.   The dispute is the last of a series of strikes by 200,000workers in 20 states against Baby Bell regional phone companies.   The settlement offer came out of 19 hours of weekend talks.   The sticking issue for NYNEX union members had been the proposedshifting of health costs to workers, ranging from weekly premiumsto $1,500 in yearly family deductibles.   CWA President Morton Bahr announced Monday in Washington thatthe health benefits issue had been resolved and that the frameworkfor a total settlement had been outlined.   The settlement called for the company to assume all healthbenefits costs, but that was traded for the dropping of a lump-sumbonus and a profit-sharing plan.   New York Telephone spokesman Tony Pappas said the $388 millionpackage would raise wages 3 percent in the first year and 1.5percent in each of the second and third years with a cost of livingallowance in each year.   Some of the local issues remaining include the hiring ofnon-union personnel and ``concessionary demands'' by NYNEX, Piercesaid. Those include extending the work week on some jobs from 30hours to 37{ hours at the same pay rate, and eliminating premiumpay for overtime.   One issue that appeared to be resolvable was the dismissal of 59people during the walkout, Pierce said. Union and managementleaders agreed to review those cases, he said.   In addition, a committee composed of Pierce and possibly NewYork Telephone President Frederic Salerno will review how to fightspiraling health costs.   Pierce said that if costs can't be contained, the issue willcome up again when the contract expires in three years.   NYNEX Chairman William C. Ferguson said in a statement that theoffer was ``a realistic solution to a very difficult set of issuesfacing not only our company but the entire nation.''   While negotiators met off and on for months, more than 500 actsof vandalism were reported. NYNEX offered $100,000 for informationon the sabotage.   Last week, two telephone cables were cut, leaving up to 361,000customers temporarily without service in southeastern New Yorkstate.   The strike delayed directory assistance, repairs andinstallations for NYNEX's 10.5 million customers in New York, twocities in Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire,Vermont and Maine.   NYNEX blamed a third-quarter fall in profits of 14.8 percentpartly on the strike.   One union member died after a confrontation Aug. 15 at a NYNEXoffice in suburban Westchester County. Police said the man jumpedon the hood of a woman's car, pounded her windshield, then fell offand struck his head. The union charges the driver struck the man asshe sped to work.</TEXT></DOC>
