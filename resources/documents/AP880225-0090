The country's leading churchman, meanwhile, warned that thePhilippines cannot survive with huge gaps between rich and poor.Leftists staged protest marches and accused the president ofabandoning promises of reform.   Several hundred followers of former President Ferdinand Marcosrallied at a downtown Manila square, calling for the ousted rulerto be allowed to return. Police said the Marcos loyalists dispersedpeacefully after nearly three hours.   About 50,000 people jammed a 1{-mile stretch of Epifanio De LosSantos Avenue, or EDSA. On that same avenue in February 1986,hundreds of thousands of people formed a human wall for four daysto protect mutineers holed up in two military camps from Marcos'forces.   The civilian-backed military mutiny, popularly called the``People Power'' revolution, forced Marcos into exile in Hawaii onFeb. 25, 1986, after he had ruled for more than 20 years.   A Philippine Air Force T-28 airplane swooped low over the crowd,which also participated in a procession of images of the VirginMary, including one borne by an armored personnel carrier.   Officials said the images were the ones carried by priests andnuns during the 1986 revolt in this heavily Roman Catholic land.   The day began with the pealing of church bells and Mrs. Aquinoclasping hands with Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos and Chief ofStaff Gen. Renato de Villa on EDSA, in front of the Camp Aguinaldogeneral headquarters.   The ceremony was followed by a daylong carnival, featuringsinging, folk dancing and performances by well-known entertainers.   But during an afternoon mass, Cardinal Jaime L. Sin, archbishopof Manila, warned that the government must address the urgentsocial and economic crisis facing this nation. Half of the 58million Filipinos live in poverty.   ``The ever-growing gap between rich and poor in our society mustbe drastically reduced,'' Sin said. ``Only then can our nationsurvive and go forward.''   Sin said the need for land reform ``hangs over us like a swordof Damocles'' and added ``urgent reforms must be taken withoutdelay.'' Mrs. Aquino ordered a land reform program last July butleft details to Congress, which has yet to approve the legislation.   Parades and festivities were held in other major cities acrossthis nation of more than 7,100 islands.   But from a shopping center near EDSA, about 10,000 leftistsmarched to the presidential palace, waving red banners, chantingslogans and accusing Mrs. Aquino of betraying the reformist idealsof the uprising two years ago.   On Wednesday, about 20,000 leftists chanting slogans in supportof communist rebels, marched to the scene of today's celebrationsand burned an effigy of Mrs. Aquino.   In 1986, Sin called on Filipinos to turn out into the streets toback mutineers led by then-Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile andRamos.   Enrile and Ramos had broken with Marcos, charging him with fraudin the Feb. 7, 1986, presidential election in which he ran againstMrs. Aquino. The rebels' action galvanized the opposition thatbegan after the 1983 assassination of opposition leader BenignoAquino, Mrs. Aquino's husband.   Prospects for broad social, economic and political reform sinceMrs. Aquino rose to power have been clouded by a $28 billion debt,a cumbersome legislature and political polarization widened by the19-year-old communist insurgency and the military's rising clout.   As chief of staff, Ramos has fended off six coup plots. Butsocial activists fear Mrs. Aquino's reliance on Ramos has lessenedthe government's commitment to reform.   The government so far has not prosecuted soldiers for allegedinvolvement in several widely publicized killings of civilians. Norhas it fulfilled Mrs. Aquino's 1986 campaign promise to abolish theCivilian Home Defense Force, a military-backed militia widelyaccused of human rights abuses.</TEXT></DOC>
