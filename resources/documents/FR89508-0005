L. 100-590, the Small Business Administration Reauthorizationand Amendment Act of 1988, created within SBA's Surety Bond Guarantee (SBG)program a pilot Preferred Surety Bond Guarantee (PSB) program which allowsSBA to authorize selected surety companies to issue, monitor and servicesurety bonds subject to SBA's guarantee without specific SBA approval.This program, unless extended by Congress, is due to end Sept. 30, 1992.These regulations implement the new statute by establishing selection criteriafor such companies, and specifying the principles and procedures (detailedin the Supplementary Information below) by which SBA will administer thenew program. The new law also reinstates, with some changes, SBA's authorityto prevent imminent breach of contract by financing the principal's performance,or providing other services, with up to 10% of the contract price. Theconditions to the use of this authority are set forth. SBA uses this occasionto make minor changes in existing regulations (specified below) by promulgatinga complete revision of the entire regulatory framework in Part 115 of Title13, Ch. I of the Code of Federal Regulations. Because section 209 of thecited statute makes its provisions effective on May 2, 1989, these regulationsare published as ``interim final'' without opportunity for prior publiccomments. SBA requests comments on or before July 7, 1989. These commentswill be carefully considered, and necessary amendments made as soon thereafteras practicable.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>This rule is effective May 8, 1989.

Parker, Jr., Tel: (703)235-2900.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>SBA's Surety Bond Guarantee regulationswere last revised on August 24, 1988 (Rev. 2), effective November 28, 1988(53 FR 32195 and 41149). The present Revision 3 follows Rev. 2 in manyrespects, and adds new provisions implementing the new Preferred SuretyBond Guarantee program (PSB) enacted as Title II of the cited statute,Pub. L. 100-590, the ``Preferred Surety Bond Guarantee Act of 1988'', persection 201 thereof (102 Stat. 3007). This supplementary information willfirst set forth the principal provisions implementing the new Act, andthen the complementary changes made to Rev. 2, the prior regulation. Provisionsof Rev. 2 carried forward into Rev. 3 are not discussed.Section 115.3(a) <T3>Policy</T3> has been amended to add the new congressional policy ofthe preferred surety bond program (PSB) at the end of paragraph (a) thereof.Section 115.3(b) <T3>Types of bonds</T3> has been amended to delete the term ``coterminous''from the discussion of ``ancillary'' bonds, because the new statute omittedthat term, which previously required that ancillary bonds could not, inpoint of time, extend beyond the life of the main bonds.A new andSection;115.3(d) has been inserted in this same section, reflectingthe policy that SBA indemnify sureties as follows:(1) Not to exceed 70% of the loss on bonds issued under the PSB program;(2) Not to exceed 80% of the loss on bonds issued under the conventional(prior approval) program, except;(3) 90% of the loss for bonds issued under the prior_approval program if_andbullet; The total amount of the contract at the time of the issuance ofthe bond is $100,000 or less, orandbullet; The bond was issued to a small concern owned and controlled bysocially and economically disadvantaged individuals, as defined in theregulation.The regulation further provides that if a contract amount of $100,000 orless at the time of bonding is subsequently increased beyond $100,000,SBA's indemnification percentage of 90% shall decrease by one percentagepoint for each $5,000 of increase in the contract amount above $100,000,but shall not decrease below 80%, the percentage which would have beenapplicable if the contract amount had exceeded the $100,000 limit at thetime of bonding.A new andSection;115.3(e) has also been inserted, which sets forth the criteriathat SBA will use to select sureties to operate under PSB. These criteriainclude, but are not limited to the following:(1) An underwriting limit of at least two and one-half million dollars;(2) Adherence to Surety Association of America advisory rates;(3) Underwriting and claims departments staffed by the surety's own employees;(4) Surety bond volume over the last five years; and (5) Rating by recognized authority. The definition section (andSection; 115.4) has been amended to contain adefinition for ``imminent breach'' (threat to successful performance);and for ``PSB Surety'' (a surety admitted to PSB and given periodic allocationsof guarantee authority). A new andSection; 115.6 sets forth in paragraph (a) the application proceduresfor admission to the PSB program, with emphasis on underwriting and claimsprocedures, compliance with SBA's requirements, and geographic diversification.Section 115.6(b) emphasizes that SBA's guarantee attaches only to bondsissued within the surety allotment authority. Bid bonds count against theallotment only until contract award, but the discharge of final bonds doesnot restore allotment authority. A surety admitted to PSB remains freeto submit guarantee applications outside PSB if its allotment is exhausted,or if it desires the higher indemnification percentages available outsideof PSB. Section 115.6(c) requires PSB sureties to observe all SBA regulations andcollect all the information and certifications that SBA requires in theprior-approval SBG program. PSB sureties must advise SBA of all bid bondsissued within two weeks, and of all final bonds within 45 calendar days,remitting the principal's guarantee fee at the same time. Failure to doso invalidates SBA's guarantee. Section 115.6(d) requires an annual audit of PSB participants by SBA examiners,as does andSection; 115.18(a). Section 115.6(e) authorizes SBA to suspend a surety from PSB on 30 daysnotice, among other reasons, if surety violates SBA regulations or itsown underwriting of claims procedures or causes SBA excessive losses. Suchsuspension may be appealed under SBA's procedures (Part 134). Section 115.7(a) reflects the changed guarantee requirements of the newstatute (section 411(a)), which now include that the contractor is a smallbusiness, that the bond is expressly required by the contract, that thebond is not available without SBA's guarantee, and that there is reasonableexpectation that the contractor will perform the contract successfully,and that the terms of the bond are reasonable. Section 115.7 (c) and (d) conform the PSB requirements to those of theprior approval program. A surety issuing a PSB guarantee must collect thesame information and certifications and its notices of final bonds mustinclude the principal's guarantee fee. Section 115.10(b) provides that SBA will verify compliance when PSB claimsare received. Section 115.11(b) requires the surety to notify SBA within 30 days of principal'sdefault, in order to enable SBA to prevent the issuance of further bondguarantees to the same principal. SBA is to be advised of a contractor'sreinstatement. Section 115.13(b) provides that PSB Sureties may also issue bonding linesif they adhere to the same limitations that SBA observes when it issuesa bonding line. Section 115.14(b) implements the restored ``imminent breach'' authorityof the new statute for both prior-approval and PSB bonds. Under a prior-approvalbond, the surety must obtain SBA's approval before making payments to preventa breach, and such payment is generally limited to 10% of the contractprice. Under PSB, a surety may use its own judgment, but SBA's total indemnificationof the surety cannot exceed its guaranteed share of the bond liability.Section 115.16 <T3>Defenses of SBA </T3>reflects the statutory change of SBA's defenseagainst liability. The newly added defenses are: material breach of theguarantee agreement, and substantial regulatory violations. Paragraph (c)defines ``material breach'', and paragraph (d) defines ``substantial regulatoryviolation'' as those which increase SBA exposure to liability by 25% or$50,000, whichever is less. This measure of a material breach of the guaranteeagreement applies both to increases in the bond liability, and in the contractamount with no change in the bond liability, without SBA's prior approval.The limit of 25% or $50,000 was selected for liability increases, eitherfor purposes of additional guarantee fee or for denial of liability bySBA, if such increase was not submitted for prior SBA approval. This conformsto the Federal Acquisition Regulation, 48 CFR Ch. I, 28.106_5(a)(2)(ii),which requires a contracting officer to obtain the consent of the surety,among other conditions, only if the contract price is changed upward ordownward by more than 25% or $50,000. Since many surety bond guaranteesare issued for Federal contracts and since lesser changes can be made withoutthe surety's consent SBA has determined to use the same criteria for theseregulations. Regulatory violations also include acts contrary to the purposes of theprogram or SBA's mission, or to national policy (e.g. racial discrimination).The new defenses are also reflected in andSection; 115.17 as grounds forrefusal to issue further guarantees or to suspend or revoke the PSB statusof a surety. In addition, the regulation adds to the examples previouslygiven for the absence of good character, the case of a person or firm debarredfrom participation in Federal programs. The following discussion covers the most significant regulatory changesfrom Revision 2 to Revision 3 which are not mandated by the statute, butare necessary in order to create the two-track system of the dual SBG program.Former andSection; 115.3(d) <T3>Appeal of surety </T3>has been omitted because informal review by higherofficials_as distinguished from formal review by SBA's Office of Hearingsand Appeals_is available throughout the SBG program. The termination ofa PSB company's status, however, requires a formal proceeding (see andSection;115.6(e)). Section 115.3(f)(1) now requires a surety to keep a contemporaneous recordof bond issuances, to enable a determination of the exact bond issuancedate versus the time work has begun. Paragraph (f)(3) of this section definesthe time work has begun as that moment when the contractor exposes hissurety to liability. This change is necessary to differentiate betweenthe issuance of bonds under a bonding line, and under PSB. See andSection;115.3(f). The definition of ``Bid Bond'' in andSection; 115.4 has been changed to shortenthe SBA guarantee of the bid bond from 12 months to 120 days. This bringsthe bid bond validity span closer to the Federal Acquisition Regulation,which allows for a 60 day extension of a bid bond beyond the time for bidacceptance without reference back to the surety (Standard Form 24, 48 CFRCh. I, 53.301-24). Accordingly, SBA's guarantee authority will not unnecessarilyremain encumbered with outstanding bid bond guarantees. This change isnecessary since PSB sureties will issue bid bonds without prior SBA approval.The definition of <T3>Loss under Payment Bond </T3>and the definition of <T3>Payment Bond </T3>in andSection; 115.4 have been expanded to includedebts of the principal (beyond labor and materials) for which the suretyis liable. The definition of <T3>Loss from Attorney's Fees </T3>no longer refers to suits against thesurety initiated by ``any other person'' besides the principal, becauseSBA did not intend to exclude from compensable loss all tort suits againsta surety. These changes give sureties operating under PSB a clearer descriptionof compensable versus noncompensable losses. The discussion of the absence of good character in andSection; 115.5(b) hasbeen modified to state that it is a person ``under indictment'' ratherthan one who ``has been indicted'' that will be deemed of other than goodcharacter, because past indictments which may have been dismissed are notrelevant to a later character determination. This change is editorial,and expresses better what SBA always intended. A new andSection; 115.5(f) provides that persons or firms debarred from transactionswith any Federal department or agency are ineligible for participationin this program. This paragraph is necessary to meet the new requirementsof government-wide debarment and suspension rules, 13 CFR Part 145 and48 CFR Subpart 9.4. Section 115.10 <T3>SBA's review of surety's underwriting standards </T3>has been conformedto the new guarantee conditions of section 411(a) of the Act; see discussionabove under andSection; 115.7(a). Section 115.12(c) <T3>SBA charge to surety </T3>has been changed. SBA's guarantee fee isnow 20 percent of the premium which a surety charges under the PSB program,or under the prior-approval program for premiums not in excess of the SuretyAssociation of America's advisory rates. On all other bonds the guarantyfee remains at a flat dollar amount_currently $4_per thousand dollars ofbond or contract amount. Both the contractor and the sureties are requiredto pay additional guarantee fees if the contract amount and/or the bondliability is increased in excess of 25 percent or $50,000, whichever isless. Sureties are entitled to a like refund if the contract amount orthe bond liability is decreased to a like extent. This change is necessaryto recognize the difference between the PSB and the prior-approval programs.Section 115.13(b) has been amended to include as work on hand, which isto be reported by a contractor under a bonding line to the surety, jobsbonded ``otherwise'', meaning bonded by a different surety. This changeis necessary because a PSB and a prior-approval surety could bond the samecontractor. In andSection; 115.13(c) the word ``determined'' has been substituted for``recommendation''. While under the prior-approval program the surety recommendslimitations on a bonding line to SBA, which SBA usually accepts, the limitationson a bonding line under the PSB program are entirely within the surety'sdiscretion. We felt that ``determined'' was suitable for both situations.Section 115.14(c) <T3>Salvage and recovery </T3>has been amended to require remittance bya surety not operating under PSB of salvage and recovery collections toSBA within 90 days of receipt. This change is necessary to differentiatebetween sureties under PSB and other sureties. Section 115.15 <T3>Claims for losses </T3>has been amended. A PSB surety may use its ownclaims form if it has been approved by SBA, whereas non-PSB sureties mustuse SBA Form 994H. A copy of the bonded contract must be submitted to SBAwith surety's initial claim for indemnification. This will save the interveningtime when SBA requests the contract for claim verification. Section 115.17(b) <T3>Business Integrity </T3>has been amended by adding to the eligibilityrequirements for sureties to participate in the SBG program, a new paragraph(5) which excludes persons debarred or ineligible for participation inany Federal program, pursuant to government-wide debarment and suspensionrules, see 13 CFR Part 145 and 48 CFR Subpart 9.4. <ITAG tagnum="85">Compliance With Executive Orders 12291 and 12612, the Regulatory FlexibilityAct and the Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>For purposes of Executive Order 12291, SBA has determined that these rulesare major since they restructure a program with a program level of $1.25billion.SBA certifies that these rules do not warrant the preparation of a FederalAssessment in accordance with Executive Order 12612. For purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 604, SBA has determinedthat these rules will have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. The following analysis is provided within the context of the review requiredunder Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603): These rules are necessary to implement the Preferred Surety Bond GuaranteeProgram Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-590, Title II approved November 3, 1988(102 Stat. 3007). This Act created within SBA's existing surety bond guaranteeprogram a new program under which SBA may authorize selected sureties ``withoutfurther administration approval, to insure, monitor, and service such bondssubject to the Administration's guarantee.'' It is therefore necessary to set forth how such sureties will be selectedto issue SBA guarantees on SBA's behalf without prior SBA approval, howthey would operate to meet SBA's requirements under the statute and theregulations, how SBA would regulate, audit and, if necessary, terminatethe PSB status of such sureties. At the same time, it is necessary to restructurethe existing regulatory system to accommodate a two-track surety bond guaranteeprogram. The change in andSection; 115.12(c) <T3>SBA charge to surety </T3>was made because the prior computation ofthe guarantee fee, a flat dollar amount, had occasionally led to absurdresults, such as in the case of supply bonds, when the SBA charge couldexceed the surety's premium. We believe that the present system will avoidsuch results. We believe that the new statute and these regulations will result in lowerbonding costs and better availability of bonds for small concerns, becausethe expected entry into the SBG program of major industry members withtheir wide organizational network, at premiums which do not exceed theSurety Association of America's advisory rates, will make more bonds atlower cost available to the small business market. It should be noted thatthe PSB represents a trade-off: PSB sureties accept a lower indemnificationrate against their losses, and lower premiums, in return for the privilegeof protecting their bonds with the SBA guarantee without ``second-guessing''by SBA. However, given the finite guarantee authority for SBA, it is conceivablethat over time a market shift away from SBA's traditional participantstowards the new SBG entrants could occur, although we do not think so.SBA's increased bonding authority, together with the trade-off discussedabove, should combine to prevent a detriment to our traditional partners.SBA is not aware of any suitable alternatives to the rules here set forth.Because of the statutory deadline for final rule making, as explained inthe <T3>Summary, </T3>these rules are published as interim final, with a requestfor comments. There are no reporting, recordkeeping and other compliance requirementsnot approved by the Office of Management and Budget which would come underthe Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. Ch. 35. There are no federal rules which duplicate, overlap or conflict with theserules. The legal authority for these rule changes is section 5(b)(6) of the SmallBusiness Act, 15 U.S.C. 634(b)(6), section 308(c) of the Small BusinessInvestment Act, 15 U.S.C. 687(c), and section 411(d) of that Act, 15 U.S.C.694b(d). <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 13 CFR Part 115 </ITAG>Small business, Surety bonds.Pursuant to the authority contained in section 411(d) of Title IV, PartB, Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended, (15 U.S.C. 694b(d))and in section 203 of the Preferred Surety Bond Guarantee Program Act of1988, Pub.

Consequently,Congress has authorized SBA to guarantee partially (upon such terms andconditions as SBA may prescribe) sureties participating in the Surety BondGuarantee (SBG) program against losses incurred as a result of a principal'sbreach of the terms of a big bond, payment bond, performance bond, or bondswhich are ancillary to such bonds, or any contract not exceeding $1,250,000in face value.

The terms andconditions of SBA's bond guarantee agreements may vary from surety to surety,depending on SBA's experience with a particular surety. Where the statutedoes not mandate the division of losses, the Office of Surety Guaranteeswill consider, among other things, surety's loss rate in this program incomparison to other sureties participating with SBA to a comparable degree,the rating or ranking designation assigned to the surety by recognizedauthority, the average dollar amount of bond penalty per bond written inthis program and the ratio of bid bonds to final bonds written in thisprogram.(d) <T3>Indemnification.</T3> (1) SBA shall pay to the surety ninety percent(90%) of the loss incurred and paid if:(i) The total amount of the contract at the time of issuance of the bondis one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) or less; or(ii) The bond was issued on behalf of a small concern owned and controlledby socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. ``Socially andeconomically disadvantaged individuals'' shall include Black Americans,Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Asian Pacific Americans, SubcontinentAsian Americans, and other minorities or any other individual found tobe disadvantaged by SBA pursuant to section 8(a) of the Small BusinessAct (15 U.S.C. 637(a)). See andSection;124.105 of this chapter. A concernso owned and controlled shall qualify if it qualifies as small under thesize standard for its primary industry as set forth in Part 121 of thischapter and if it is at least fifty-one percent (51%) or more owned bysuch disadvantaged individuals, and it is managed and its daily businessoperations are controlled by one or more such individuals.(iii) In cases where the contract amount, subsequent to the issuance ofthe bond under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, increases to more than$100,000, through change orders or otherwise, the percentage of SBA's indemnificationof the surety shall decrease by one percentage point for each $5,000 ofincrease or part thereof, but shall not decrease below 80 percent.(2) SBA shall indemnify a surety not operating under PSB in an amount notto exceed an administrative ceiling of eighty percent (80%) of the losson bonds issued to other than disadvantaged concerns, or on bonds on contractsin excess of $100,000 (one hundred thousand dollars).(3) SBA shall indemnify a surety operating under PSB in an amount not toexceed seventy percent (70%) of the loss.(e) <T3>Selection of sureties for the PSB program.</T3> SBA's selection ofsureties empowered to issue, monitor and service bonds subject to SBA'sguarantee without prior SBA approval will be guided by, but not limitedto, these factors:(1) An underwriting limitation of at least two and one-half million dollars($2,500,000) on the U.S. Treasury Department list of acceptable sureties;(2) An agreement to charge small concerns bonded under PSB no more thanthe advisory premium rates of the Surety Association of America; (3) Underwriting authority is vested only in employees of the surety'shome office who, as a group, write at least 25 percent of their contractbond business outside the SBA Surety Bond Guarantee program; (4) Claims are processed and settled only by employees of a permanentclaims department satisfactory to SBA;(5) Number of bid and final contract bonds issued by the surety from yearto year for the last five fiscal years;(6) The rating or ranking designations assigned to the surety by recognizedauthority.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The PSB program shall terminate on September 30, 1992, unless extendedby Act of Congress.

The amount of the contract to be bonded shall beestablished as of the time of issuance of the executed and guaranteed bondor bonds. The contract amount shall not exceed $1,250,000 in face value.The amounts of two or more contracts for a single project, to be performedin phases, shall not be aggregated if the prior bond is released (otherthan for maintenance or warranty_see definition of ``contract'' in thissection) before the beginning of each succeeding phase.

(f) Loss from attorneys' fees and damages. ``Loss'' shall not include attorney'sfees and court costs incurred by a surety in a suit by or against SBA orits Administrator, and shall not include such costs or payments (<T3>e.g., </T3>tort damages) arising out of a successful suit soundingin tort initiated under the bond by a principal against such surety. (g) Loss after excess contract amount. Where the contract amount, throughchange orders or otherwise, within the limits permitted by andSection;115.16(e),is increased after issuance of the executed guaranteed bond beyond thestatutory limit of $1,250,000, SBA's share of the loss shall be limitedto that percentage of the increased contract amount, which the statutorylimit represents, multiplied by the guarantee percentage approved by SBApursuant to andSection;115.3(d). Thus, if a contract amount has been increasedto $1,375,000, SBA's share of the loss under an 80% guarantee would belimited to 72.73% [<T3>1,250,000</T3>/1,375,000=90.91% andmultiply; 80%=72.73%]. ``Obligee'' means in the case of a bid bond, the person requesting bidsfor the performance of a contract, or in the case of a payment bond orperformance bond, the person who has contracted with a Principal for thecompletion of the contract and to whom the primary obligation of the suretyruns in the event of a breach by the principal of the conditions of a paymentbond or performance bond.
