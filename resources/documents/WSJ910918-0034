Underthat arrangement, the Soviets could receive technicalassistance from the IMF in formulating their economicreforms, but would not be able to borrow money from theinstitution.   But the IMF hasn't completed the documentation to beginthe special associate status for the Soviet Union, promptingTreasury Secretary Brady's complaint.   &quot;We don't need a highly legalistic arrangement,&quot; Mr. Bradytold reporters. &quot;It's the most important event in the last100 years, and here we are arguing about legal documents.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
