 First the applications are migrated, then the data.andP;  Thistechnique provides a way to build new applications while still running theold ones -- with both the new and the old application using the samedatabase.andM;According to Gene Shklar, Oracle Corporation's director of marketing, NetworkProducts Division, Belmont, Calif., &quot;There are two key trends.andP;  One is themove to relational databases, specifically SQL.andP;  The second trend is towarddeploying new applications on cost-effective computers where the computingpower sits right next to the user of the application on a workstation, ratherthan being remotely accessed by a terminal to a mainframe.&quot;andM;However, Shklar said that these two trends are &quot;incompatible with where themajority of corporations' mission-critical data is located.&quot;andM;According to Shklar, most of that data is still located in mainframes and innonrelational databases like IMS and IDMS.andM;Shklar said that in addition to worrying about how to roll in the newtechnology and how to implement applications on this technology, the MISdirector or CIO must also be concerned with what to do with the existingmission-critical data and the applications that access that data.andM;&quot;One of the biggest examples of mission-critical data still existing onmainframes using old technology,&quot; said Shklar, &quot;would be the billing systemsused by the telephone companies all around the country.andP;  I'll bet that if youcall up a telephone company's MIS department, you'd find out that all of themuse IBM mainframes to do billing for their customers and that they keep thedata in non-relational databases.andM;&quot;The telephone company does two primary things.andP;  It provides a communicationservice, which has to be available nearly 100% of the time, and it has to getpaid for providing this service.andM;Shklar proposed that the migration path offered by Oracle's database gatewaysoffers a solution for companies looking to move to relational databases andnetworked workstations.andM;&quot;An essential characteristic of a database gateway is it allows a new tool toaccess an old database.andP;  The database gateways like SQL*Connect make it seemto the application that it's accessing data in this new relational SQL dataformat, whereas the data could be coming from an old, nonrelational formatlike IMS.&quot;andM;This is how the migration works.andP;  The old data is left where it is.andP;  Then,new applications are developed using new tools deployed on new technologies,such as workstations with graphical user interfaces.andP;  These new applicationsaccess the old data using the database gateways.andP;  Now, new applications canaccess the old data in its original data sources and the old applications canrun against the old data the way they always have.andM;After all the applications have been converted, the data can then beconverted to relational databases.andP;  Since the new applications always thoughtthey were accessing relational databases, they are ready for the newdatabases.andM;&quot;It's like providing a new access path to old data.andP;  So you first migrateyour applications and then you migrate your data.andM;&quot;The key is that the data in the old, nonrelational database looks likerelational data to the new application.andP;  Once the old data is migrated to arelational database, it looks like the same relational data that it wasbefore.andP;  The real trick was making the old, hierarchical data look likerelational data to the application.andM;&quot;With a database gateway, you don't have to migrate your applications andyour data at the same time,&quot; Shklar said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
