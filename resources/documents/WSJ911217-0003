Late in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.5745 marks,down from 1.5885 marks late Friday in New York. The U.S.currency also was changing hands at 128.40 yen, down from129.05 yen. Sterling fetched $1.8251, up from $1.8160.</LP><TEXT>   Early Tuesday in Tokyo, the dollar was trading at 128.30yen, down a bit from Tokyo's close Monday of 128.45, and at1.5775 marks, down from 1.5843 marks at Monday's close.   Traders said the interest-rate cuts could come as early astoday, at the regularly scheduled meeting of the FederalReserve Board's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee.   It's widely expected that the Fed will ease the discountrate, the rate at which the central bank lends to commercialbanks, to 4.0% from 4.5%. The Fed is also expected to easethe federal funds rate, the rate that banks charge oneanother for overnight loans, to 4.25% from 4.5%.   U.S. economic data released yesterday heightenedexpectations for a Fed cut, traders said.   Industrial production fell a seasonally adjusted 0.4% inNovember, according to the Fed. Market analysts had forecasta 0.2% fall. The October performance was unrevised atunchanged, and September was unrevised at up 0.2%.   The Fed also released capacity utilization for November,showing that U.S. factories, utilities and mines operated ata seasonally adjusted 79.1% of capacity last month. Marketobservers had expected a 79.3% operating rate in November.The rates for October and September were unrevised at 79.6%and 79.8%, respectively.   &quot;The numbers . . . weren't particularly invigorating,&quot;said John McCarthy, chief foreign exchange dealer at Abn-AmroBank N.V. in New York in commenting on the data.   Interest rates &quot;still have room to come a bit lower onwhat is seen to be continued sluggishness&quot; in the U.S.economy, Mr. McCarthy said.   Traders said they expect the cuts, when they come, to bebearish in the short term for the dollar, but bullish longerterm for the U.S. economy and the currency.   Short term, lower U.S. interest rates will increase thealready wide gap between U.S. and most European interestrates, making dollar-based investments less attractive.   Traders are &quot;concentrating on interestrate differentials,&quot;not the longer-term economic impact of lower U.S. rates, saidLawrence Weinman, vice president of foreign exchange optionsat Societe Generale in New York.   German overnight interbank lending rates were at9.00-9.10% yesterday, while the U.S. federal funds targetrate was about 4.5 percentage points lower at 4.50%.   Furthermore, traders said that the bearish U.S. consumersaren't likely to be impressed by another cut in domesticinterest rates.   &quot;Yes, cuts will help&quot; the U.S. economy, said MichaelMoore, managing director at Continental Bank N.A. in Chicago.But, he added, it's a question of &quot;how much, and how quickly&quot;they will help.   Although many market watchers argue that a series of ratecuts this year hasn't been effective, &quot;there is aninterest-rate level that will generate economic&quot; activity,said Kevin Logan, economist at the Swiss Bank Corp. in NewYork. The Fed &quot;just hasn't hit it yet,&quot; he added.   Mr. Logan said a rate level that is low enough will inducepeople to take the risk of investing, despite the fact thatthe return on investments generally has dwindled.   &quot;Whether it's investment in machinery or in an apartment,&quot;at some point people decide the risk is worth the benefit ofowning the asset, Mr. Logan said.</TEXT></DOC>
