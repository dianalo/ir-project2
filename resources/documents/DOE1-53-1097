Thesamples were prepared in vitro by adding {sup 181}Hf-NTA solution tohuman serum. Two specific electric quadrupole interactions were observed,which correspond to two well-defined binding configurations. Their relativeintensities depend on the pH, salt- and hafnium-concentrations, and onthe incubation time. The present data may be compared with the resultsof a previous rat serum study, where the hafnium binding to transferrinbehaved rather similarly. Small but significant differences, however,can be deduced from the TDPAC-parameters for these human and rat transferrinspecies. For either binding configuration, the electric field gradient(EFG) is slightly higher in the case of rat transferrin. The most characteristicdifference, however, concerns the asymmetry parameter eta 2 of the secondbinding configuration, which is about 10% smaller for rat serum transferrin.The TDPAC-technique might be used as a sensitive and reliable analyticalmethod to study the metal-binding sites of different transferrin species.</TEXT></DOC>
