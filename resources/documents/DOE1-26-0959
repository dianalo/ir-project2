This paperpresents analytical methods for preliminary evaluation of the economicfeasibility of a proposed cogeneration plant. Equations are developedwhich permit rapid estimation of: generator size, cogenerated power cost,economic payback, additional hospital gas consumption due to cogeneration,and cogeneration cycle efficiency.</TEXT></DOC>
