As he sees it, the benefits have flowed mainly to a narrow circle of institutions, securities-industry professionals and the already wealthy. &quot;And how many jobs have been sacrificed in the takeover, cost-cutting and restructuring binges that have fed the rally?&quot; he adds.    Though admittedly partisan, Mr. Barbanel nonetheless is voicing a widespread puzzlement and unease about the stock market's surge. Stock prices have soared more than 200% in the past five years, but national output has increased barely 40% before inflation -- and only 20% if inflation is taken into account.    The stock market &quot;strikes me as being all by itself,&quot; says Charles P. Kindleberger, emeritus professor of economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. &quot;There is no real industrial investment boom behind it. It's a puzzle.&quot;    Of course, many of the millions of Americans who directly own stocks have chalked up big profits. But many others mostly lament lost opportunities. The big winners in the bull market seem to be pension funds and other institutional investors, and their gains affect ordinary citizens' wealth only indirectly.    Since the bull market began Aug. 13, 1982, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed from a close of 776.92 the previous day to 2592.00 last Friday. Powering that climb has been a mixture of familiar and unusual forces. Ironically, the trigger for the initial surge was trouble -- the Mexican debt crisis. The U.S. Federal Reserve System eased credit to ward off world-wide financial problems, and the consequent drop in interest rates made U.S. stocks appealing to investors. Then, the economic expansion that began in late 1982 brightened the profit outlook and lifted stock prices further; so did additional interest-rate declines through 1986.    But as the bull market's fifth anniversary approaches this week, stock prices are also being driven by new computerized trading strategies loosely known as program trading, by the burgeoning financial futures and options markets and by foreign, mainly Japanese, buying. Moreover, a huge wave of corporate restructurings and takeovers, buy-outs and buy-backs has washed away a lot of stock, leading investors to bid up the shrunken supply of shares remaining -- and to hope for still more takeovers.    If the bull market lives on into this December, it will set a record for this century, overtaking the 63-month surge from 1924 to 1929, says William LeFevre, a market analyst at Advest Inc. Other professionals use different yardsticks, however.    To many individual investors, the rally has often seemed too good to be true. &quot;I haven't been as aggressive as I could have been,&quot; laments R. Scott Bowles of Cincinnati. The 77-year-old former Procter andamp; Gamble Co. executive regrets that he didn't play such hot performers as General Electric Co. stock, didn't discover mutual funds until two years ago and didn't invest more heavily in them.    Even mutual-fund investors have been perhaps too cautious, overwhelmingly preferring bonds over stocks. Last year, for example, Americans bought $161 billion of bond funds, far exceeding the $54 billion of stock-oriented funds, according to the Investment Company Institute.    And many individuals haven't played at all. During the explosive first phase of the bull market in late 1982, Harry Savage, a New York public-relations executive, reaped a takeover profit of more than $300,000 on the shares of his employer, Norton Simon Inc., which was acquired by Esmark Inc. But he eschewed what he thought was an &quot;overpriced&quot; stock market and put most of his windfall into a commercial-real-estate partnership. It was liquidated late last year &quot;at only a little better than break-even,&quot; Mr. Savage says.    The exact number of individual stockholders isn't known. According to the New York Stock Exchange, the total climbed from some 30.6 million at the end of 1981 to 36 million at the end of 1985.    However, shareholder registers have been shrinking at some of America's best-known companies. General Electric, which had 514,000 holders at the end of 1981, had only 492,000 at the end of last year. General Motors Corp. and American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. also note declines. Although wider use of Wall Street custodial services may understate the current number of individual holders because the shares are listed under brokerage-house names, a GE spokesman observes: &quot;We do have more than 100,000 fewer employees today than we did five years ago. And most of them were shareholders.&quot;    Many of the market's recent stars have been lifelong finance professionals. Among big-time investors and takeover specialists, for example, Asher Edelman probably has multiplied his net worth at least fivefold, to an estimated $100 million. But even he says: &quot;I think things are way overdone. I've sold everything in the stock market that isn't hedged.&quot;    By now, the most prominent stake in the market is held by institutions. In a survey by Pension andamp; Investment Age magazine, the 200 largest pension plans reported assets of $1.01 trillion as of Sept. 30, 1986. Of that, $440 billion was invested in stocks, up substantially from 1982.    Indirectly, this pension boom benefits the wider public. According to the Labor Department, about 23 million private-sector employees participate in &quot;defined-contribution&quot; pension plans, which allow employees to share in all of a fund's investment gains -- when they retire.    But an additional 15 million private-sector employees, and most public employees, are covered by fixed-benefit plans, which pay out set amounts to beneficiaries whether the market does well or poorly.    Participants in such plans &quot;don't care what the stock market does -- nor should they,&quot; says Fred Grauer, who heads Wells Fargo andamp; Co.'s investment-advisory unit. Instead, as these pension plans grow ever larger, the principal winner is the parent corporation sponsoring the plan. Its excess pension assets are seen as additional financial strength, which, ironically, can help stoke further gains in its stock price. That presents the eerie prospect of a stock-market rally literally feeding on itself.    Of course, there are some fundamental reasons for the market's surge. In the past five years, corporate profits have risen and, as inflation dwindled, improved in quality. Meanwhile, long-term interest rates have been halved as a result of an accommodative Federal Reserve monetary policy and the lower inflation.    In addition, some observers contend that during America's economic malaise of the late 1970s and early 1980s, stock prices were pounded down to unreasonably low levels. &quot;It was time for {stocks} to recover,&quot; says Burton Malkiel, the dean of the Yale School of Management.    But the economy's advance since 1982 has been much more fitful than the stock market's surge. While new service industries have sprung up, traditional manufacturers -- many devastated by imports -- have been forced to retrench. A Labor Department study shows that 10.8 million Americans lost their jobs in plant closings and layoffs in the five years to January 1986. And Conference Board researchers estimate that from 1984 through 1986, corporate restructurings and mergers eliminated 600,000 management jobs.    Of course, the unemployment rate has dropped to 5.9% of the labor force, including the military, from 9.7% five years ago, and total employment has increased more than 13 million. Nevertheless, the upheaval in the job market makes it debatable how much the stock market's rise has brought its usual spillover benefits to the wider economy. The $1.8 trillion increase in the value of U.S. stocks since 1982 has undoubtedly made many American households wealthier on paper. But with job prospects dicey, it's unclear how much more they have been spending -- and much of their spending has gone into imports.    Similarly, the buoyant stock market has, in theory, made it easier for corporations to raise money to finance expansion. But capital spending, adjusted for inflation, has grown only moderately in the past five years. Instead, many companies have bought back vast amounts of their own stock, and, at many others, managements have bought out public holders.    For Jack Morris of Minneapolis, the takeover boom has financed his children's education -- and cost him his old job. The former investor-relations official at Gulf Oil Corp. owned 1,000 shares of the Pittsburgh oil giant. But in early 1984, as Chevron Corp. maneuvered to acquire Gulf, Mr. Morris transferred all his Gulf stock into four trust accounts for his daughters.    &quot;Whatever happened to me, I was going to be sure the kids got to college,&quot; Mr. Morris says. Sure enough, Chevron paid $80 a share for Gulf that year, more than double Gulf's stock price a year or two earlier. That lifted each trust account's value to $20,000.    But as Chevron began retrenching at Gulf, Mr. Morris left, landing a new job at Pillsbury Co. in January 1985. Since then, Chevron has dismantled Gulf's old operations in Pittsburgh to cut costs.    In broad terms, the takeovers, buy-outs and buy-backs have significantly shrunk the amount of stock available to investors. Henry Kaufman of Salomon Brothers estimates net withdrawals over the five years at $400 billion. And as more money chases fewer stocks, that acts like a booster rocket sending the market into orbit.    Meanwhile, a similar buildup of liquidity overseas began igniting foreign stock and bond markets as well in the early 1980s. In Japan, especially, corporate investors, flush with huge profits from their booming exports, eagerly joined the fray.    The dollar's steep decline, which began early in 1985, soon attracted some of the excess foreign liquidity. The more the dollar dropped and overseas markets rose, the cheaper U.S. stocks and bonds looked to foreign investors. In 1986, foreign investment -- net of sales -- in the U.S. stock market topped $18 billion, triple the prior record set in 1983. This year, it is running at an annual rate of $35 billion or more.    Some people argue that Wall Street also is getting a lift from so-called program trading, in which big institutions or securities firms trade baskets of stocks simultaneously, often earning small but nearly risk-free profits by hedging their positions with stock-index futures. As much as $150 billion may have been employed in such strategies, and program trading undeniably has helped fuel a boom in stock-market trading volume. This year, New York Stock Exchange daily trading is routinely topping 150 million shares, up sharply from about 50 million shares a day in 1982.    Individual investors such as Mr. Morris blame program trading for some abrupt market moves, such as an 86.11-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average last September, when many of Mr. Morris's stocks were sold. However, Wall Street professionals respond that on a percentage-change basis, trading really isn't much more volatile now than it ever was. But big intraday moves &quot;may have caused some anxiety on the part of individual investors,&quot; Salomon's Mr. Kaufman concedes.    Overall, the bull market's biggest winner may be the securities industry itself. Wall Street firms have raked in billions of dollars in fees for arranging the mergers, buy-outs and restructurings that have helped stoke the rally. And they have raked in billions more in trading profits, money-management and underwriting fees, and brokerage commissions.
