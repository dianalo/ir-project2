But now that things are looking up, a new type of stateaid -- an exchange-rate guarantee introduced last year forAirbus's West German partner -- is threatening to scuttle thewhole deal.</LP><TEXT>   U.S. trade officials say that if a comprehensive agreementisn't signed by the end of this month, they will take theircomplaint on the German aid to the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade. They say they may even pursue the GATTcomplaint if an agreement is reached.   &quot;We held off (going to the GATT) in February so thatpeople wouldn't appear to be negotiating under the gun,&quot; saysone U.S. official familiar with the dispute. &quot;But Aug. 1 isthe cutoff. After that, we'd feel free to ask for a GATTdispute-settlement panel.&quot;   If the U.S. does that, says a French government officialinvolved in the negotiations, all bets will be off for anagreement with the Europeans.   The U.S. contends that such government guarantees ofexchange rates are illegal under the GATT code on subsidies.The European Community and the four Airbus nations all aresignatories to the code.   Although the money Bonn will have to payMesserschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H. to cover some of itsAirbus risks probably won't be enormous, &quot;it sets aprecedent,&quot; says one U.S. official. And for West Germany, theworld's largest exporter, to give exchange-rate subsidies toits industry is &quot;patently ridiculous,&quot; he adds.   The problem cropped up last year when carmakerDaimler-Benz AG took an initial 30% interest instate-controlled MBB, whose Deutsche Airbus unit holds a37.9% stake in Airbus. As a condition of the takeover and ofDaimler's eventual assumption of majority control of MBB,Daimler insisted that it not be stuck with MBB's Airbuslosses.   Thus Bonn pledged to cover a portion of MBB's share oflosses on aircraft sold if the mark's value is between 1.6and 1.8 to the dollar, under certain conditions. Aircraftnormally are sold in dollars. The program, which will be ineffect until 2000, would shift the burden back to MBB if therate passes 1.6 to the dollar. But if that were the case,&quot;we'd have to consider whether a European aircraft industryis viable anymore,&quot; says one German official.   The exchange-rate aid was part of the price Bonn had topay to bring a private investor into MBB, says Hans Birke,Deutsche Airbus's senior vice president for corporatedevelopment. &quot;It is a once-only measure withoutprecedent-setting effects,&quot; he says, adding that Bonn &quot;wouldcertainly say no&quot; to other German companies that asked forsimilar assistance.   A senior West German official concurs. &quot;There has been noother application by German industry for the same scheme,&quot; hesays. And although Bonn will have to pay MBB something -- hecouldn't say what -- for the Airbus program for 1989, theamount &quot;does not correspond to our worst scenario.&quot;   Airbus's other partners, Aerospatiale of France, BritishAerospace PLC and Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain,receive no equivalent aid. But it doesn't appear that theywould squawk if the MBB subsidy dooms a peaceable settlementto the Airbus dispute.   The French official says Paris regards the German subsidyas &quot;a deal between the German government and its industry. .. . a question of sovereignty.&quot; A draft settlement preparedby the Europeans would prohibit exchange-rate guarantees onall future Airbus models but would give grandfather rights tothe MBB plan and to all existing models or those now underdevelopment, the French official says.   The Airbus dispute dates to 1986, and it has blown hot andcold over the years. In short, the U.S. contends thatgovernment subsidies that Airbus receives allow theconsortium to build airplanes that may not be commercialviable and to sell those airplanes at prices that bear littlerelationship to costs. The Europeans counter that the U.S.aircraft industry is hugely and indirectly subsidized throughdefense research contracts and that the U.S. dominance of theworld airline market is a distortion of trade.</TEXT></DOC>
