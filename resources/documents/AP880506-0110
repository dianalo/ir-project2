Kauffmann and diplomats Marcel Carton and Marcel Fontainearrived in Paris Thursday after being freed Wednesday from threeyears of captivity. They were the last French hostages to bereleased from Lebanon.   Premier Jacques Chirac hinted that France might restorediplomatic ties with Tehran, which he said helped secure thehostages' freedom. The government denied reports that it had paid aransom.   AFP quoted Kauffmann's sister Marie-Genevieve Dagin as saying heshared a cell recently with Frank Herbert Reed, who was``mistreated to the point of being left prostrate.'' Reed waskidnapped Sept. 9, 1986 and is one of nine American hostages inLebanon.   Kauffmann, 44, Carton, 62, and Fontaine, 45, were in theVal-de-Grace military hospital for two days of examinations.   In a statement issued after the AFP dispatch quoting his sister,Kauffmann said he intended to speak fully at a news conference nextweek and did not want anyone speaking for him or relaying hisimpressions until then.   Mrs. Dagin's telephone in Rennes was constantly busy thisafternoon when The Associated Press tried to call.   She was quoted by AFP as saying her brother told her theAmerican hostages held by the pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem groupIslamic Jihad were ``the object of brutality because they tried toescape.''   The dispatch did not make clear whether Kauffmann specifiedwhich were mistreated for attempting to get away.   Mrs. Dagin was also quoted as saying that she learned from herbrother that Fontaine was briefly detained with Terry Waite, thespecial envoy of the archbishop of Canterbury. Waite disappearedJan. 20, 1987, while on a mission in Lebanon seeking the release ofthe hostages.   Fontaine had said Thursday that he had shared a cell withAmerican Terry A. Anderson, the longest-held foreign hostage.Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent for the AP, waskidnapped March 16, 1985, in Beirut.   Kauffmann was kept in total darkness for a year and a half, hissister was quoted as saying.   ``He did not see the sun or a glimmer of light for a singleinstant. An arm and a leg were chained permanently to a radiator,even when he slept,'' she was quoted as saying.   He told her he was moved to 18 different locations, sometimestransported in a coffin, the agency reported.   ``He told us that each time he feared he would not get out,because there was no air,'' she was quoted as saying.   Chirac also thanked President Hafez Assad of Syria and Lebanesemilitary authorities for their help in freeing the hostages.   Tehran Television, monitored in Cyrpus, quoted Ali RezaMoayyeri, an Iranian deputy prime minister for political affairs,as saying Iran interceded ``for humanitarian reasons.''   French goverment officials denied they paid ransom for thehostages' release. But Britain and other countries accused Franceof dealing with terrorists while 18 other foreigners remain hostagein Lebanon.   In Batavia, N.Y., Anderson's sister Peggy Say said Thursday shewould go to Paris to talk to Fontaine.   ``It's wonderful news for the French,'' Mrs. Say said. ``But itmakes it all the more frustrating and disappointing to compare whattheir government does to what our government does.''   Fontaine told a reporter from the French television Channel 5that he ``passed the time playing dominoes and chess'' withAnderson.   Carton, Fontaine and Kauffmann appeared ashen and shaky as theywalked slowly down the airplane steps on arrival in Paris.   Earlier, Kauffmann said that Michel Seurat, the 39-year-oldFrench researcher captured with him on May 22, 1985, probably diedof cancer. Seurat's kidnappers claimed he had been executed.   Carton and Fontaine were kidnapped March 22, 1985.   On Thursday, Chirac said normal relations with Iran ``could beenvisaged.''   France and Iran broke diplomatic relations last summer overIranian Embassy employee Wahid Gordji, who refused to submit toquestioning about a series of bombings in Paris in September 1986.   Reports in Paris and Beirut said that in exchange for the threeFrenchmen, France agreed to repay the outstanding balance on a $1billion loan made by the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, ousted inthe Iranian fundamentalist revolution of 1979.   On Nov. 11, 1986, six days before France agreed to a $330million payment, pro-Iranian extremists released two Frenchhostages. On Dec. 24, another hostage was released.   Ten French hostages have been released since Chirac's governmenttook office in March 1986.   Interior Minister Charles Pasqua denied press reports thatransom had been paid for the hostages.</TEXT></DOC>
