The Natural Resources Defense Council said oil development byTexaco Inc. and other companies was destroying Ecuador's 32 millionacres of tropical rain forest.   It demanded that Texaco establish a $50 million fund foremergency cleanups and implement environmental controls to preventfurther contamination of the rain forests.   ``The company bears at a minimum a moral responsibility to makeappropriate reparations,'' the group said in a report on results ofits 18-month on-site investigation.   A Texaco spokesman, Dave Dixon, said the company did not receivea copy of the report and therefore could not comment on specificcharges. But, he said, ``In all its operations, Texaco's policy isto operate in accordance with the highest standards ofenvironmental conservation.''   The report was released Wednesday at a press conference attendedby Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an attorney for the group who went toEcuador in July with its investigative team.   He said contamination from spilled oil and poisonous wastes fromhundreds of oil wells was some of the worst he has seen.   ``Children have pus coming out of their eyes from bathing instreams, animals are dead ... adults have rashes covering theirbodies,'' Kennedy said.   The government of Ecuador has recorded about 30 major oil spillsfrom the Trans-Ecuadorian pipeline between 1972 and October 1989,with an estimated loss of 16.8 million gallons of oil, the councilsaid. The pipeline was then operated by Texaco, it said.   The Exxon Valdez oil tanker spilled about 10.8 million gallonsof oil into Prince William Sound in Alaska in March 1989.   The environmental group said that besides spills, more than 4million gallons of untreated toxic wastes are discharged daily intounlined pits and ultimately seep into streams and aquifers.   The pipeline is particularly vulnerable to spills because itcrosses a major Andean fault. In March 1987, earthquakes caused 5.9million gallons of oil to spew into the Coca River.   Cleanup efforts are primitive, at best, the group reported.   Kennedy said he saw residents of the Cuyabeno Wildlife Reserveusing their bare hands to scoop oil into plastic bags during acleanup. The bags were buried in open pits.   At an oil well near the Shuara community he saw a man walk intoa pit filled with toxic wastes from oil production hauling out logsand sticks to clean it up.   ``He was submerged in oil. You could only see the whites of hiseyes,'' Kennedy said.   Besides its charges against Texaco, the environmental groupurged Conoco, a subsidiary of Du Pont Co., to cancel plans to drilloil in the region, saying it would risk irreparable injury to theindigenous Huaorani people.   Ed Davies, president and general manager of Conoco Ecuador, saidin a telephone interview from Quito, Ecuador, that the company wasworking closely with the Huaorani, who number only 1,580, to ensureoil development does not harm them.   Environmental problems in Ecuador's tropical rain forests resultfrom an outdated mindset about oil drilling, he said.   ``They really are 20-year-old developments that the entire oilindustry recognizes must change. And Conoco is committed to doingdevelopment in a responsible manner,'' Davies said.</TEXT></DOC>
