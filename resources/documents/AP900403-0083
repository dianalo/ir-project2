Enraged Hindus went on a rampageafterward, and five police officers were reported injured.   Most of the casualties from the bomb blast were Hindus, but someSikhs who had been watching the procession were among the victims.Police said 68 people were injured in the explosion.   The bomb went off as about 100,000 Hindus celebrating the birthof a god-king marched through a crowded vegetable market in Batala.The town is 25 miles north of Amritsar, the holiest Sikh city andthe stronghold of Sikh militants fighting for a separate nation inPunjab state.   Senior police superintendent S.K. Goel said the bomb was hiddenin a scooter parked outside a cigarette kiosk.   Goel said 30 of the injured were in serious condition. He saidSikh militants were probably responsible.   The radicals have killed more than 500 people this year in theirquest for a Sikh homeland. They are a minority in Hindu-dominatedIndia but form the majority in Punjab, a farming state in northernIndia.   Soon after the blast, angry Hindus went on a rampage, hurlingstones at a police station near the market, said a policeinspector. He said five policemen were injured.   Officers fired into the air to quell the riot, and an indefinitecurfew was imposed in Batala, a Hindu-dominated city of about120,000 people.   The annual procession marked Ram Navami, a Hindu holidaycelebrating the birth of Rama. Rama is extolled in Hindu lore as anincarnation of Vishnu, a member of the supreme Hindu trinity ofgods.   Food vendor Prem Nath described the explosion from his hospitalbed in Amritsar. ``There was loud sound. Then the entire area wascovered with dark smoke and fire which rose as high as electricpoles,'' he said.   Earlier Tuesday, a bomb exploded on a bus in another town nearAmritsar, killing the driver and one passenger, senior policesuperintendent Anil Sharma said.   Police also blamed Sikh extremists for that blast. Both thevictims were Sikhs.   When the Sikhs began their fight in 1982, they targeted Hindus.In recent years they have turned their guns on fellow Sikhs who donot support the separatist cause.   The militants say members of the Sikh faith, which has roots inboth Islam and Hinduism, are discriminated against politically andculturally by the Hindu-dominated government.</TEXT></DOC>
