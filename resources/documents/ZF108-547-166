Tauscher,  ComputerLand: Besides the US,andM;ComputerLand operates in 30 countries.andP;  Outside the US its major focus isCanada and Europe; we have a smattering of franchise operations in SouthAmerica and the Far East and a co-owned operation in Australia and NewZealand.andM;Dyson: Are you trying to operate overseas essentially as you're operatinghere, or do you do things quite differently?andM;Tauscher: The answer is yes and no.andP;  It's clearly the same business, but ifyou don't understand the differences, which tend to be issues as opposed tofundamental strategies, you'll have a horrible time.andP;  Europe in particularhas all kinds of idiosyncrasies, the most obvious being language and money.andM;We operate a central-distribution operation in Europe in 14 countries andthat, in and of itself, is an interesting pre-1992 challenge.andM;Dyson: Do you have just one more word on how important it is to localize yoursoftware and in which countries? Win some places just take stuff in English?andM;Tauscher.andP;  All the software's localized; to do it differently is a hugemistake.andP;  The distribution is also localized because the countries aredifferent.andP;  Obviously, you have language issues, but even more importantly,you have very real marketing issues when it comes to software.andP;  Thedistribution channels are different in that they're more fragmented.andP;  Dealersand distributor fines tend to blur more, and there are many dealers, most ofwhom are not organized.andM;For example, we believe we're the &quot;largest dealer in Italy,&quot; and we might do$31 million there next year.andP;  There are big differences when it comes tothose issues; from a marketplace standpoint, it is very much a localphenomenon.andM;Dyson:  What's the general level of pricing?andM;Tauscher: It's higher.andM;Dyson: Is it more profitable or does that cover increased costs?andM;Tauscher: For the dealer, it's more profitable than in the US.andM;Dyson: So are they going to see a similar consolidation?andM;Tauscher: Absolutely.andP;  It's already beginning.andP;  We could go on at lengthabout marriages being made, discussions going on, acquisitions occurring -afl the same phenomena.andP;  It's several years behind, and you don't yet havesome of the predominant forces.andP;  We have 150 outlets in Europe and will do$400-and-some million this year.andP;  Compared with the market we're a peanut,but that's because the market hasn't consolidated yet.andM;Dyson: Mike, you're much more involved with the Far East.andP;  Why don't youattack some of the same issues? Michael Quinlan, IBM.- I came back to the USlast year after Michel Bera (Matra), Mary Meeker (Salomon Brothers), BenRosen (Sevin Rosen Management) Bera: But can you play charades in French?andO;living in Tokyo for two years as IBM's financial officer in Asia we dobusiness there in about 18 countries.andP;  There are a couple of lessons toappreciate.andP;  First of all, every country in Asia is different.andP;  You find outvery quickly that doing business in Japan is quite different from opening onein China.andM;The other 16 countries each have their own laws and cultures and differentcompetitors and so forth.andP;  As we assess the world marketplace, what isimportant is the fundamental fact that the world outside the US is growingfaster - significantly faster.andM;Generally, their economies are healthier.andP;  They're further behind if you willin terms of installing technology; that is, there's less saturation, sothere's more opportunity.andP;  As Bin just mentioned, the price levels and themargins tend to be higher.andM;I'll characterize a few countries and then stop, because you could borepeople to death with stories about Asia.andP;  Once you start this, it's hard tostop !andP;  The whole story has to be given to Japan; it's obviously the dominantfactor.andP;  Of all the business our industry does collectively in the Far East,I'd suspect that close to two-thirds of it is done on the island of Japan.andM;When you add in the so-called four dragons - Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan andKorea, afl of which are growing - that probably gets you up to 90 percent ofAsian opportunity.andP;  All the other countries, which are absolutely importantlong-term, are still a relatively minor place.andP;  So most of our attention isall too appropriately directed toward that 90 percent because it's sodominant.andP;  That's an opening profile of what Asia's an about.andM;Dyson: Thank you.andM;Robert M.andP;  Kavner, ATandamp;T.andP;  Esther, this has been a real dilemma for ATandamp;T'scomputer business, because up to five years ago, the corporation was notallowed to operate any of its businesses outside the US.andP;  When thedivestiture came, we were given the opportunity to go overseas.andM;At which time, we were also given the opportunity to enter this industry.andO;Our entry into the computer industry has been anything but swift.andP;  We made anumber of mistakes, some of them relating to our stabilization.andP;  As part of aturnaround program we have under way, which is beginning to reap benefits, weconcluded - somewhat as Vittorio did when he was running ATandamp;T's computerbusiness -that we were going to be successful in the US before we startedconquering other lands.andM;Until a year ago, we had not made a major thrust outside the US.andP;  We're about$2 trillion in volume.andP;  In 1989, we closed about $100 million outside the US,$60 million of it in Canada, which is a natural market for us.andP;  We have donethis in a very focused way.andM;I'm not putting a lot of money into it now, because we still have work to dohere in the US.andP;  We're focusing on three countries in Europe - the UnitedKingdom, France, Germany - and a few countries in Asia, primarily identifiedsystems integrators and value-added resellers, who understand a UNIXplatform, who are focusing on networking, or on our computer businesses.andP;  Weare partnering with them, and I see that as our primary vehicle as we movefurther along.andP;  But we're going to have to do it in a controlled way.andM;Dyson: Do you care to mention any specific mistakes you made that otherpeople might learn from?andM;Kavner: Vittorio and I were talking about one we shared at ATandamp;T.andP;  When wasit, Vittorio 1/2 in  84?andM;Vittorio  Cassoni, Ing.andP;  C. Olivetti:  84.andM;Kavner.andP;  We had a grand plan with Olivetti.andP;  We owned about 25 percent ofOlivetti, and the notion was that Olivetti has a very strong base in Europe,and a good base in Asia and the Pacific Rim.andP;  ATandamp;T obviously has a very goodbase in the US, so why don't we bring our two businesses together, but notnecessarily in a merger? Each company would be responsible for distributionand marketing in each of those markets or relative markets, and we wouldcarve up responsibility for the product area.andM;It was a great plan.andP;  It stunk.andM;The lesson is one I've learned for the rest of my career: The hardest part isafter you shake hands and say, &quot;This is going to really work,&quot; because thenyou have to go to work on execution, on things that people don't get suntansdoing.andM;In terms of material, logistics and product planning and developmentplanning, it was two different cultures and two languages some were notfamiliar with.andP;  Not enough thought was given to the operational requirementsof pulling off a relationship like that.andP;  So any of you who go into apartnership like that, you're 10 percent there in the strategic agreement; 90percent is in execution.andM;Dyson: Have the people from Bull called you for advice about Zenith?andM;Kavner: No, I'm too busy at my own business right now.andM;Dyson: Dave  Tory, who heads the Open Software Foundation, you're not exactlydistributing in Europe, but Europe is a hotbed of UNIX.andM;David  Tory, Open Software Foundation: Yes, that's right.andP;  As a European,I've got two points.andP;  One is that I came out of Europe as a software person,going back into the  60s, so I've got a perception from that side.andM;From an OSF point of view, we see a tremendous amount of high-leveltechnology being developed and researched in Europe.andP;  In fact, that's why wehave a research organization based in Grenoble.andM;We also have a development center in Munich, partially for political reasons.andO;After afl Siemens is in Munich, and they do support OSF.andM;For obvious reasons, we are located in Japan.andP;  From an OSF long-term point ofview, we see Europe and the Far East at least as strongly as the US.andP;  As faras UNIX is concerned you're absolutely right: In Europe UNIX iswell-developed.andP;  We're not quite such new boys as the implication might be...andP;  We've been using it a great deal over the last few years.andP;  To thatextent, there's a very strong market there.andP;  But, if I may quickly divert tomy other hat as an ex-European software developer and marketer, there is themost extraordinary opportunity out there now.andP;  Everyone's talking aboutexpanded marketplace.andP;  For every company that's involved directly orindirectly in the software business - and a large number of people here aresoftware-related - the distribution opportunities have never been stronger.andM;In fact, about half the business my last company does is now outside the US.andO;it's expanding very rapidly in the pc area, mid-range as well as mainframe.andO;They're moving rapidly because of this extraordinary opportunity, and afl ofyou should take advantage of it.andP;  However, while '92 is going to ease a lotof barriers, those barriers weren't significant in the software industry asfar as I was concerned.andM;One thing to remember is that language does count for an awful lot of theproblems in the various markets - the ethnic, if you like, or indigenousmarkets - of Europe and to a degree the Far East.andP;  Internationalization asfar as software and services has come, but you still have to distribute yourtechnology, you still have to be able to sell your technology, you still haveto be able to service your technology.andP;  That implies a much less effectiveeconomy of scale than there would be in the US, or would probably be inGermany.andM;Dyson: Thanks.andP;  I'd like those of you in the audience who have officesoverseas, Europe or Asia, mainly, to raise their hands.andM;[Show of hands]andM;Dyson: That looks like a good half of the audience.andP;  There's probably somedouble-counting, but how many of you at least have distributorships or knowyou sell a fair amount overseas, even though you're not located thereyourselves?andM;[Show of hands]andM;Dyson: Okay.andP;  Add that to the half, and we've probably got, I don't know,four-not four-fifths.andP;  Five-sevenths, or something like that.andM;[Laughter]andM;Dyson: How many of you have translated your software?andM;[Small show of hands]andM;Dyson: Okay, so your advice to these guys would be that they'd better gotranslate it fast?andM;Cassoni: Absolutely.andM;Tory:  [Nods affirmatively]andM;Dyson: How many of you aside from Vittorio get more than 50 percent of yourrevenue outside the US?andM;[Show of hands]andM;Dyson: That's still an impressive number for a US audience.andP;  That's what, 20people or something? How many of you - this is a vague question - aredeciding to devote substantially more resources to going overseas?andM;[Show of hands]andM;Dyson: Okay, so at least this panel has a real audience.andP;  That was maybe athird of the people who were dramatically scaling up their interests.andP;  Pleasecome up and start going to the mikes.andP;  How many of you who have translatedyour software into one other language? Like German or French orwhat-have-you? [Small show of hands] Nope.andP;  So, the people who have done itare doing it on a fairly serious basis.andM;Rick Kraus, Persoft: I hear a lot about quality issues in the industrial andmanufacturing areas.andP;  Would you comment on both the hardware and softwareside? Implications?andM;Cassoni: That's such a broad subject, quality.andP;  I can tell you what we aredoing in Olivetti, and many other companies are following more or less thesame path - which, by the way, was started in Japan quite a while ago.andM;Without frustrating afl of the efforts that are represented in this roomincluding my own, technologies basically are flattening.andP;  In other words,there will be less and less differentiation in the product lines.andP;  As acorporation, the new product that we sell is really our organization.andM;If that is correct, and I'm convinced it is, what is being sold in the futurewill be less important than who sells it.andP;  We should apply to the new productthat we sell - our organization - the same quality disciplines that we usedto apply fairly skillfully to the physical products.andM;Within the organization, all points of interface with our customers - whetherit's billing, collection, service, software or systems or support, et cetera,et cetera - are as important as the single product.andP;  Kraus: Thanks.andO;Specifically, I was asking how our quality stacks up to the expectations andthe local software in Europe and in Japan? It took American industry a longtime to really admit to itself, maybe it hasn't yet, that there really is aquality difference.andP;  When you try to sell a floor wax machine in Japan, ithas to perform differently from here to he successful.andM;How much do we know about the quality of our software relative to othercountries?andM;Cassoni: I don't know what you find here.andP;  I haven't noticed any majordivergence - either in perception of quality or in actual quality - betweenUS or European software.andM;Quinlan: Nor have 1.andP;  Japan certainly has distinguished quality standards onhardware manufacturing, but I haven't seen that same distinction in softwareyet.andM;The other comment I'd make is that it is absolutely in the belly of theJapanese to be serious about quality; it's not something you do after thefact to be competitive, when you realize somebody else has better quality.andO;One of the reasons that's true is because two-thirds of the executives inJapan come out of a manufacturing development background.andM;In rough terms in the US, two-thirds come out of a finance marketingbackground.andP;  That fundamental difference in who runs enterprises culturallyshapes organizations.andM;Kavner.andP;  I was going to comment about Japan, and then I realized Mike spenttwo years there.andP;  In the UNIX market, UNIX System V has done better in Japanthan anywhere else.andP;  The Japanese take it and are building applications onit.andP;  Those in the application world need to pay attention to thesignificantly improved quality that's coming out of software developmentlaboratories in Japan.andP;  That seems to be on a track not dissimilar to themanufacturing track, in terms of the Japanese coming up our tailpipe.andM;Dyson: Thank you.andP;  Copy protection.andP;  Is that a problem? I know a lot ofvendors who don't copy-protect here, but tend to copy-protect overseas.andM;Tory: That's the subject of another panel, isn't it? There's not a lot ofdifference in terms of copy protection in its own right.andP;  The end-users havemade it very clear they don't want any form of enforced copy protectionthrough means other than licensing.andM;There's another aspect.andP;  Where there's a fear that technology imported intothe US might, through government intervention, come in on a less-than-fairbasis, legal protective mechanisms are put in place that may redound as faras tariffs and this sort of thing.andP;  We've got to be very careful in dealinginternationally where something like 70 or 80 percent of the total softwaremarket worldwide is US-based.andP;  The US software industry has to be verycareful it does nothing to expand this protective process, because it's theindustry that's going to be hurt the most if that's done.andM;Dyson: What government is subsidizing the development of software?andM;Tory: One issue in the papers at the moment is some CASE technology coming infrom Singapore, ostensibly supported by a government grant.andM;Think about the amount of software being developed in the US or outside theUS through local development agencies or authorities, and supported by grantsof all sorts of shapes and descriptions in the US.andP;  If you start putting atariff up against ostensibly supported software coming into the US, God knowswhat's going to happen with software going out of the US into thosecountries.andM;Morton H.andP;  Rosenthal, Corporate Software: This is more a plea than aquestion.andP;  About a third of our business is from our three Europeansubsidiaries.andP;  Typically, we sell there to the same type of account that wesell to here.andP;  This is the local large account, some of which may besubsidiaries of US companies, and some of our European accounts have Americansubsidiaries we sell to.andM;The problem is that the vendors tend not to allow us to treat those customersas one entity.andP;  Typically, they are in the same businesses worldwide.andP;  Yetfrom a pricing and service point of view, we have to re-invent the wheel inevery market in terms of the vendor relationships.andP;  It becomes veryfrustrating for a German subsidiary of an American company to pay twice whata US company pays for the same thing.andP;  It is a little offensive, and they areoffended.andP;  I am speaking on behalf of them.andM;Cassoni: Which company? Which company are you -  Dyson: Corporate Software.andO;But Mort, can you make a profit if you're going to sell in Germany for halfof what the other guy does?andM;Rosenthal: We or the software vendors? Are you asking us? I mean we can - Cassoni: I think software vendors can.andP;  Initially, maybe there weren't enoughskills to justify the translations, but now the translations tend to berelatively easy.andP;  Our customers are frustrated by two things: first, thehigher price and second, the inconsistency.andP;  If you are an accounting firm,doing the same fundamental business in Munich and in Missoula, yet have todeal with totally different terms and conditions, it is very difficult.andM;In general, the software vendors do not allow for international contractswith an international customer, never mind with an international reseller.andM;Tauscher:  Esther, if I might add to that, it's easy to get focused on thepricing problem.andP;  Frankly, I'd be willing even to five with the pricingproblem.andP;  The big problem - forget worldwide, let's just stay focused onEurope - is that with one exception, one single manufacturer, we have tonegotiate fundamentally different terms, conditions in setting programs, etcetera, in each of the countries we deal with.andP;  Put aside all the talk about1992.andP;  We literally are prohibited from being a European-wide company.andM;We we've already solved the border problems which win be easy in 1992, we areworking out ways to solve the banking and the currency problems - which arereal problems in Europe and tough ones to solve.andP;  But we're strugglinghorribly with the fact that all our supplier manufacturers tend toindividualize to each country aH their incentive programs, their policies,their promotions, even when they're in the same countries.andM;It makes it very difficult to operate a European entity.andP;  Frankly, we'regoing to stay away from it, as illogical as that sounds in the face of 1992,because we've been successful in changing only one manufacturer.andM;Dyson: Which manufacturer?andM;Tauscher: Hewlett-Packard.andM;Dyson: There's a contradiction here, because everybody talks about how thesedifferent characteristics affect different national markets, and I don'tthink -  Rosenthal: That doesn't mean you shouldn't take advantage of thefact that it's the same entity.andP;  The issue isn't whether -  Dyson: What's thesame entity?andM;Rosenthal: The end result, the French into English and from English intoGerman, or the Italians into anything else, isn't going to happen.andP;  If youhave one entity that's a vendor, one entity that's a customer and one entitythat's a reseller, you should take advantage of those commonalities.andM;Cassoni: There is nothing magic about the reasons this happens.andP;  The coststructures of the different countries are completely different.andP;  The cost oflabor in Germany is different from the cost of labor in France and certainlydifferent from the cost of labor in Italy.andM;The fiscal system is different; the social security system is different.andO;Look at any given product - the net price and the operating margin, not thegross margin, that you actually realize in each subsidiary.andP;  You'll find thatthe value you can add to your product from the cost of goods sold to yourdistribution network, before you get to your operating profit, has to do withyour local presence.andM;Your systems have a different cost, your systems engineers have a differentcost; therefore, you tend to have different prices in different countries forthe same product.andM;Rosenthal: As Bill said, the issue is not price; the issue is more terms andconditions.andP;  We can have a marketing program that works here with a vendor,take it to the US, take it to Germany and, then, when we want to do it inFrance, it's re-inventing the wheel.andP;  It doesn't make any sense.andM;Cassoni: I must say I'm not familiar with that.andP;  Apart from price, which ispart of terms and conditions, we have the same terms and conditionsthroughout Europe.andM;The only exception is the local governments.andP;  Some are remarkably slower topay than others.andP;  We do recognize that, because we are better off allowingfor six months more to make payment in Italy with a higher price.andP;  But withthat exception, terms and conditions are the same.andM;Tory: Of course there is a difference in Europe.andP;  The cost of sales has beenlargely the same, if not slightly better, in Europe than in the US.andP;  Wherethe difference comes is in the cost of labor and such.andP;  It's moving towardthe idea of separation of product from service which we talked about earlier,where there's a significant difference in the service element, which has tobe paid for.andM;But I doubt it, because the service is going to be more intrinsic.andP;  When theprimary development is done in the US and then the product is changedlocally, or whatever, it does give you an opportunity to separate out servicemore rather than provide it as part of the product.andM;Kyohji Kunitomo, Ricoh: I have some people in Japan.andP;  I'd like to explainbusiness development there.andM;US has a lot of advanced technology.andP;  To develop a business in Japan, ratherthan to discuss with a big company, it is important that you should giveaccess to the mission to those individual, excellent people, engineers.andP;  Withthat access, have feedback.andM;I don't know why US companies didn't try to use individual, good agents inJapan to develop your business in Japan.andM;Dyson: Why don't you respond, Mike?andM;Quinlan: I'm very familiar with the Ricoh relationship, since I negotiatedwith IBM.andP;  What he's saying - and he's right - is that the country isfundamentally different.andP;  For example, the banking system is different.andP;  It'sa cash society.andP;  Anybody coming into that country with application expertisedeveloped in the US, thinking they're going to have their application easilyexported to a new environment, is naive.andM;When you factor in the culture and the language differences, the only way tosucceed in Japan is in concert with a good Japanese partner who understandson-line technology.andM;Now you've got the framework for a successful development project.andO;Personally, I am not optimistic that if I were a shareholder in a softwarecompany and you were going to take things you developed outside Japan, thatyou would import them successfully into that country.andP;  I think you're naive.andM;On the other hand, there's remarkable innovation in American companies whichis respected by the Japanese.andP;  With the right Japanese partner, I think youcould break some of your innovation into that environment, develop there, andbe ever so successful.andM;I hope I'm picking up some of your thoughts with that response.andM;Kunitomo: Even if you're a big company, like distribution company, it'ssometimes difficult to get the know-how by yourself in Japanese market.andP;  Sorather than to go to the big company in Japan as a partner, it's nice youalso approach the individual or a small company or end-user.andM;Dyson: Thank you very much.andM;Is somebody here from Lotus, whom I believe had quite a success after a longtime with 1-2-3?andM;Frank  Ingari, Lotus: The keys, really, were hiring a president who was alocal national, a Japanese fellow named Sakaguchi from Sony.andP;  It took us ayear to do that, and build a strong local organization.andP;  We put about two orthree people in from outside, one from the United Kingdom and two from theStates, and every other person there is Japanese.andM;We customized products significantly before we launched.andP;  We took about 18months, not only to put it in full Japanese, but also to introduce somecustomizations like radar charts which weren't used in the States but weredemanded there.andM;Dyson: What's your share there?andM;Ingari: It's higher, higher than in the States.andP;  Somewhere around 80 percent.andM;Dyson: Wait until Philippe comes in !andP;  Carolyn Hayman, Korda andamp; Company: I'dlike to speak about European countries, because I don't think it's simply aquestion of cost differences, although those are important.andP;  There are verysignificant cultural differences which affect the extent to which peopleadopt new products.andM;To give you a simple example: While doing research for one of the US vendors,we learned that in Scotland, when the PS/2 came out, you couldn't sell ATs -dealers had ATs in their stockrooms they couldn't sell.andP;  In the US, peoplehappily went on buying ATs for years, because they were cheaper.andM;Germany is a market where customers generally try to keep up with new IBMreleases because there's a commitment to quality.andP;  In the United Kingdom,they'll buy secondhand IBM machines two or three generations back, becausethey're buying on price.andM;Given those kinds of cultural differences, it seems entirely appropriate andrealistic for vendors to have different marketing programs in each country.andO;Any vendor who thought he could have a single marketing program across Europewould very quickly come unstuck.andM;John  Chisholm, John  Chisholm Company:  Esther, this is a question thatdeals less with worldwide issues than it does with UNIX.andP;  But it's such anopportunity to have Dave  Tory and BobandM;Kavner next to each other - I don't think this alignment of planets is goingto happen again in the course of the conference.andM;Tory: Happens every day.andM;Chisholm: At Uniforum last week, a new order appeared to be emerging with OSFand ATandamp;T.andP;  That was ATandamp;T with strength and a new focus on the operatingsystem itself, System V.4, and OSF with strength and focus on value-added ontop of the operating system in Motif and network computing facilities likeApollo/NCS.andM;Do you gentlemen agree with this assessment? And if so, does it suggest a newera of cooperation between the groups?andM;Tory: Bob, why don't you answer that one?andM;Kavner.andP;  That assessment is not the way I would make it, but the conclusionyou reach is one that I am making.andP;  I'm trying to stop wasting energy tryingto differentiate with another implementation of UNIX.andM;I don't think even if we won that it means very much, because there are manythings that do mean more and there are other real competitors out there.andP;  Weare trying to reduce what I see as a painful, unnatural tension between thetwo implementations.andP;  We are trying to get our people to share more of whatthey are working on, especially something that's interesting, so theimplementation can be similar.andM;We have the operating system out; we are working hard on networking; we'reworking hard on extensions to the operating system; we offer Open Look inaddition to the basic source tape, so that you know we are working on a funrange.andP;  I know OSF is as well.andM;The change you are seeing is a move to get out of this UNIX war notion andmake sure that the UNIX community is together, to take advantage of theopportunity there for UNIX and this window of a year or two.andP;  That's what wehave to do.andM;Dyson: The window until OSF comes out?andM;Kavner.andP;  No, no, no, the window until [mumble] comes out.andM;Tory: I thought OS/2 was out, sorry -  Dyson: OSF/2.andM;Tory: OSF/2, sorry.andP;  Quite right.andM;I think that the public perception is very important.andP;  There's a tremendousamount of interaction behind the scenes.andP;  It's very useful in sellingnewspapers to be controversial or to report a controversy.andM;Talk about the differences in the platforms.andP;  Yes, there are somedifferences, but they're about 80 percent similar.andP;  Same base technology,same base standards, same commitments as far as support of customer base, V.3customer base, same forward-looking direction, and so on.andM;But one aspect of this is a competitive innovation.andP;  An awful lot's happenedto UNIX in the last year or so.andP;  Some people say it was going to happenanyway.andP;  The OSF precedent is the extraordinary position of always coming outwith something that was going to he done anyway, but we were a bit quicker inbringing it out.andM;Dyson: In announcing it.andM;[Groans]andM;Tory: Moving right along...andM;Dyson: I'm sorry.andM;Tory: Yes, we're very open about everything we do, because we have to be veryopen about what we say as well.andM;[Laughter]andM;The important thing here is we're novel, developing new technology.andP;  We'rebringing technology that already exists and already has a platform, and we'rebringing it through to market in a way that people can choose for themselveswhether they want it.andM;We're going to sell product; we provide technology in a referenceimplementation, based on the technology that already exists.andP;  That process ofcompetitive innovation in driving UNIX forward is important.andP;  But, really, weare very close in a lot of things such as platforms, the standards base, andthe interaction that takes place at the technical review sessions in terms ofstress-setting requirements and experiments.andM;Dyson: Is this question international?andM;Robert  Berland, IBM.- Actually, it's UNIX International.andM;[Groans]andM;If we take just two significant markets, Japan and Europe, as two separatemarkets, could the panel comment on what share they expect UNIX, DOS and OS/2to have on the desktops in 1992 and 1995?andM;The second question is: In the US we're led to believe there's a corporationheadquarters trying to bring those individual desktops and corporateapplications, which might be group-ware, into the corporate informationinfrastructure to share information.andP;  Is that also happening in Japan andEurope, and at what pace?andM;Dyson: Okay, and while you're at it, desktop OS/2 and UNIX, and on servers?andO;Who wants to take this? Vittorio, you're good with numbers.andM;Cassoni: I'll try.andP;  I don't have numbers, and I don't think crediblestatistics exist.andP;  Let's say, the fastest-growing operating environment inabsolute terms in Europe today is UNIX.andM;Now then, if we go specifically on certain hardware platforms such as theIntel platform, I don't know.andP;  In fact, I can't quote the shares between UNIXand OS/2 or between UNIX, OS/2 and DOS.andP;  In the server environment today, thefastest-growing operating environment is UNIX.andM;Dyson: So do you think the share of UNIX there is going to be higher than inthe US?andM;Cassoni: I would tend to think so.andP;  One specific reason is that UNIX isbecoming recommended, and we should not forget about this.andP;  The publicadministration market in Europe is huge.andP;  Probably larger than in the US,because it's the sum of many different public administration markets.andP;  UNIXis taking hold there, so I would assume UNIX probably will fare better inEurope than in the US.andM;Dyson: On desktops as well as servers?andM;Cassoni: I would say so, yes.andM;Kavner: I think it will go quicker in Europe than in the US, but I think it'sa matter of a lag as opposed to not happening in the us.andM;The other part of Ids question is a very interesting one: What's happening incommercial environments in large companies?andM;[Bell rings]andM;Is that a legitimate ben?andM;Dyson: No, no, that went off by mistake.andM;Kavner: We've been at UNIX for a while.andP;  It wasn't too long ago we wouldspend half our time talking about UNIX instead of the product to a commercialcustomer, because it was not yet in those organizations.andM;A major shift has occurred: UNIX is in almost every significantly sizedcommercial organization.andP;  The mainframe environment is coming down, and inthe last 18 months a UNIX thrust is coming up, essentially driven off thesenetworks, sometimes with simultaneous DOS support.andM;This thrust is going to continue greatly, but there will always beapplications for mainframes too.andP;  If you look at the designs coming out ofmany companies around the world- symmetrical multi-processing machines,fault-tolerant inches and 486 architectures - almost all of them are beingbuilt on a UNIX platform.andM;Quinlan: Japan is unlike the rest of the world where the debate is whodominates among DOS and OS/2 and UNIX and microsoft and Intel and IBM andCompaq and Apple and so forth.andP;  They make their own architecture, so thefinal question in Japan is: Who's going to accept NEC?andM;The point is a little less emotional in Japan.andP;  To be very honest, I'm notreally quite sure who's going to prevail yet.andM;Kavner: But it seems that now, as I've visited the Japanese companies, everyone, other than NEC, is going UNIX; that looks to be the environment ofchoice.andM;Quinlan: Bob, I was describing Japan.andP;  I don't deny that Japanese companies,to make sure they are viable worldwide competitors, may end up makingdecisions if UNIX, DOS and OS/2 is the issue, but they may make a verydifferent decision in terms of how they compete for their own business.andO;Remember, Japan is about half the US market.andP;  It's a self-sufficient market,as important as Germany will be after it is reunited.andP;  We sometimes forgethow big it is on its own merits.andM;It's conceivable the Japanese will do two things: They'll have whateverstandard is most appropriate to go after the Japanese opportunity, and adifferent set of standards to pursue worldwide business.andM;It isn't clear yet where this is going to end up.andM;Tauscher: There is a significant structural difference between the low end ofthe marketplace in Europe and in the US.andP;  If you look at our overseasdealers, almost to a man they have UNIX capability.andP;  Remember this morning Isaid that almost to a man it doesn't exist in the US.andP;  If you look at thesegmentation of the people selling to the end-user, a tremendously higheramount of business goes through VARs, and the VARs are much more developed inEurope than those in the US.andM;Again, I'm talking about desktop pcs and file servers.andP;  There's no questionthat there's a larger UNIX trend in Europe, if you will, and a larger UNIXcapability, led by those two factors, than there is in the US.andM;Clearly, momentum is developing around OS/2 in Europe that was late gettingstarted even compared to the US.andP;  I don't know that we'll ever end up likethe chart I had up, which is really a US chart to some degree, because themarkets are different and they won't end up being operated quite the same.andO;Kraus: Would you comment on whether in Europe the problems of migration up tonew computing platforms aren't as great as they are in the US? I've heardthat in Europe people can leapfrog right up to OS/2, PM platforms, ISO and soforth.andP;  There's a much more difficult problem in the US, where there's agreater installed base that doesn't exist in Europe or Japan.andM;I wondered whether you think that's fact or fallacy.andM;Cassoni: I'd say in any single customer, the problem is exactly the same inthe US.andP;  I don't see any reason why it should be different.andP;  But if you lookat a total market, then no, it's not the same thing, because Europe is muchless penetrated than the us.andM;Therefore, if you measure a migration on the base of the total market, youwill see the new system picking up more quickly in Europe than in the US,simply because there is a less important installed base to migrate from.andM;Patricia B.andP;  Seybold, Patricia  Seybold's Office Computing Group: I'm curiousabout the networking scene in Europe and Japan.andP;  Vittorio, you commented thatnetworking can be the underlying technology to unify Europe, and we've beentalking about the UNIX momentum in Europe.andP;  Earlier, we talked about the messthat we've got with all the local-area networks that don't have a supportinfrastructure.andM;How is that going to be handled? Who's going to do network management? Whatkind of networks are people going to use? Where are they going to come from?andO;How are they going to be tied into wide-area networks? Who are going to bethe dominant players?andM;Cassoni: Well, let me go back for a moment and say why I believe networkingwill be more important in Europe than in the US in the years to come.andO;Basically, it is because most, not all, of today's European industry islocal.andM;Take banking.andP;  There is no European banking today of any relevance.andP;  MostEuropean banks have a strong hold on their local market, and little hold onforeign markets.andP;  As for distribution in Europe, another important sector,there is no K mart or Montgomery Ward.andM;You have a very large distributor in France; you have large distributors initaly and large distributors in Germany, et cetera.andP;  That is also true formany other industries.andP;  Possible exceptions to that are older industries likethe automobile industry and others like that.andP;  Basically, all of the serviceindustry is local.andM;Now, during the process of Europe's unification, expansion of these companiesis being sought through acquisitions.andP;  In the US, the banking industry isconsolidating for different reasons, such institutions are not performing,not because all of a sudden they have discovered the cohesiveness of the USmarket.andM;The first point is that these people will have to put together informationsystems to manage their new operations that must reconcile the basicincompatibilities of today's systems.andP;  That will create a necessity fornetworking layers which can isolate users from the basic incompatibility ofthese information systems.andM;That in itself becomes a big push for standards.andM;Apart from the normal ...andP;  or the US phenomena that push for networking, the1992 process in Europe is exacerbating this push.andM;The public administration areas I mentioned earlier are a huge project.andP;  AUof the public administrations in Europe are basically done with differentvendors, because they've all favored the local vendors.andP;  In France you haveBUR; in Germany you have Siemens; in the United Kingdom you have ICL; inItaly you have Olivetti and IBM.andP;  That's basically the public administrationstructure; to network those is a huge job.andM;Who will do it? Very tough question.andP;  It's a huge, fantastic opportunity forsystems integrators, if they have enough credibility to pull it off.andP;  When Italk about networking here I'm really talking about networking in the widestsense - both local-area networking and wide-area networking.andP;  All thetraditional hardware and software vendors, basically software vendors, areinvesting substantial amounts of money to become systems integrators toaddress exactly this opportunity.andM;Seybold: But you see that as top-down, rather than bottom-up?andM;Cassoni: Top-down, yes.andM;Dyson: It's time for Bob  Kavner.andP;  Thank you aH very much.andM;[Applause]</TEXT></DOC>
