Wall Street's decline Monday also had a wilting effect in Tokyo and Europe. In Sydney, though, stocks posted a record gain.    In London, profit-taking resulted in an anticlimatic session after the sharp surges Monday and Friday that lifted the 100-share index more than 85 points.    Yesterday, the index fell 20 points to 2143.3 after notching a record close Monday in anticipation of the announcement of a general British election. The index traded as much as 30.9 lower yesterday morning, and was off about 25 going into the last hour of trading.    The Financial Times 30-share index fell 16.5 to 1670.4.    There will be &quot;very, very volatile markets between now and the election,&quot; said the head dealer at a major British securities firm. Most investors won't want to commit funds in the short term because they &quot;want to see (the election result) in black and white,&quot; he said.    Foreign investors also are likely to wait for the outcome, dealers said. &quot;On election day we'll be watching to see the Japanese come into the market,&quot; one said.    Stock prices found some support for their partial recovery from a rebound in government bonds, which ended with gains of as much as 3/8 point after starting the day down more than 1/2 point. British Aerospace fell 6 pence to 655 ($10.92). At the company's annual meeting, the chairman, Sir Austin Pearce, said he couldn't yet report agreement with the government on aid for development of the Airbus Industrie A-330 and A-340 aircraft. The chairman said he was optimistic agreement would be reached, and analysts said they expect a government announcement as early as today.    Oil issues were lower despite a modest rise in spot oil prices. British Petroleum was down 8 at 338, and Shell was down 14 pence at 12.88 pounds.    Among mining stocks, Consolidated Gold Fields rose 7 to 974, and RTZ advanced 7 to 10.34 pounds. The issues benefited from a rise of about $6 in gold on the spot market to a bit more than $460 an ounce.    In the wake of Wall Street's retreat Monday, Tokyo prices drifted lower amid profit-taking in heavy trading.    As investors stepped back, profit-taking also struck banking issues, popular stocks in the previous two sessions.    The Nikkei stock average, which rose 18.99 points Monday, fell 72.37 to 24535.85. The first section index fell 13.97 to 2179.78. Turnover totaled about 1.3 billion shares, up from 1.2 billion Monday.    The retreat by the U.S. bond and stock markets, triggered by rising commodity prices, gave Tokyo investors an excuse to take profits after the Nikkei's recent strong advance, traders said.    Many banking, steel, heavy industry, utility, food and construction stocks eased as a result.    The top gainers were home-building issues, which benefited from news that Japan's government will lower the interest rate on housing loans to 4% from 4.7%, according to Daiwa Securities Inc.    In export-led electrical and computer shares, Japan Victor Company soared 120 yen to 1,900 ($148.38) amid optimism fueled by the relative stability in the yen-dollar exchange rate. The gain occurred despite JVC's unconsolidated results that showed sales in fiscal 1986 were even with the previous year, while export sales fell 11%.    The unchanged overall sales figures still were a bullish sign that JVC is making good in a sector battered by the strong yen, a trader said. &quot;It could have been worse,&quot; he said. Fujitsu, tied to recent developments in superconductors, rose 38 to 822 on newspaper stories about the new technology. Archrival International Business Machines over the weekend announced an advance in superconductor research.    In Sydney, stocks rose to record levels amid rising commodity prices in overseas markets and prospects of further declines in Australian interest rates.    Among the biggest resource issues, Broken Hill Proprietary rose 25 cents to 10.35 Australian dollars ($7.46) after reaching a day's high of 10.45.    Frankfurt, Paris, Zurich and Amsterdam all slipped because of concern about the dollar's weakness. Wall Street's decline Monday also hurt stocks in Frankfurt and Amsterdam.    Finally, Brussels stocks again fell amid a political crisis resulting from a language dispute in Flemish and French-speaking Belgium.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                   % This                              May 11     May 8     Year    U.S. ..................... 272.0     273.7    + 19.3    Britain .................. 646.2     635.7    + 29.9    Canada ................... 421.5     420.9    + 26.5    Japan ................... 1334.2    1332.8    + 41.2    France ................... 462.0     458.7    + 13.2    Germany .................. 222.4     222.4    - 14.4    Hong Kong ............... 2008.4    1985.4    + 12.9    Switzerland .............. 188.1     186.8    -  6.3    Australia ................ 338.2     339.8    + 28.1    World index .............. 475.7     476.5    + 33.3</TEXT></DOC>
