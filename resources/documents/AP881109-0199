Nov. 8, 1988. It wasn't so much election day as re-election day.   Nearly everyone in sight _ White House Republicans and CapitolHill Democrats alike _ was routinely returned to office.   By electing George Bush while strengtrats' handin Congress, voters hening the Democeffectively put an end to the Reaganrevolution.A Bush era of pragmatic, bipartisan governance will likely begin.   President-elect Bush clearly recognized the profound impact ofTuesday's ticket-splitting: Asked whether he can work effectivelywith his acerbic fellow Republican, Sen. Bob Dole, Bush on Wednesdayexpressed only casual deference to his party's Senate leader andthen emphasized, ``We've got to get some good support from theDemocrats for some of these ideas.''   ``Look, this campaign is over,'' Bush said when asked aboutworking with Lloyd Bentsen, the defeated Democratic running mate whoretains his chairmanship of the Senate Finance Committee. ``There'sno hard feelings.''   The Democrats had n advantages of incumbency, there is nomistaking voter comfort with this power-sharing arrangement: WhiteHouse leadership from the Republicans balanced by purse-stringpriorities set by congressional Democrats. For the first time in 28years, the party losing the presidency actually increased itsstanding in Congress.   During President Reagan's first term _ with a landslide, asupply-side mandate and a Republican Senate _ the White House calledthe tune on Capitol Hill. But in the second term _ winner of 49states but running behind no specific legislative program _ Reaganwas forced to compromise. The budget was written by congressionalcollaboration and practically dumped on the White House door step.   Bush said Wednesday he'd appoint a ``lean'' transition staff toset priorities and to fashion a strategy for legislative success. Heindicated that he'll do a lot of jaw-boning to pass his programs,and he's likely to take advantage of the fact that Congress wouldwelcome a flexible president with open arms.   ``I think there'll be a honeymoon,'' said Senate JudiciaryChairman Joseph Biden. ``Most of us have known George Bush for along time.'' Even so, he acknowledged that ``there will be a littlefence-mending needed'' after the nasty campaign.   Bush reveled in the margin of his victory Wednesday, but heseemed to realize that the voters provided no mandate for change, tohim or anyone else. Half those eligible to vote didn't bother, andthose who did vote spoke in one voice which appeared to say, ``Don'tmake waves.''   Status Quo I: The presidency was returned to the Republicans forthe fifth time in the last six elections.   Status Quo II: The House of Representatives was re-elected enmasse; 99 percent of the members were returned to office, manywithout opposition and all but a few without serious struggle. Italmost seemed that the only way for an incumbent to lose an electionwas to be brought up on charges.   Status Quo III: The House was securely in Democratic hands forthe 35th straight year.   Status Quo IV: The Senate stood still as well. Democratsincreased their majority from eight to nine. A few incumbents wereforcibly removed from office, but voters delivered no significantmessage to compete with the 1980 Reagan rebellion which sent 12Democrats to the sidelines.   (Aside from Michael Dukakis, the voters' most prominent victimwas Lowell Weicker of Connecticut, a maverick lawmaker whosedisappearance from the Senate will do much to enhance partydiscipline in the chamber.)   Status Quo V: Voters were so intent on making no waves thatMarylanders withstood a $4 million barrage from the National RifleAssociation and declined to repeal an incumbent gun control law.   Several House incumbents did not fare so well. Fernand StGermain, a power in the House for many years and chairman of theHouse Banking Committee, barely survived a Justice Departmentinvestigation which cited ``evidence of serious and sustainedmisconduct'' for allegedly accepting favors from lobbyists. Hesuccumbed at the polls, as did freshman Pat Swindall.   Swindall, R-Ga., was turned out of office following hisindictment on perjury charges in a drug laundering case.   A few incumbents were actually turned out without a hint ofscandal. Sens. John Melcher, Chic Hecht, David Karnes and Weicker,along with Rep. Mac Sweeney, R-Texas, were left to wonder why thevoters singled them out as rare exceptions to the 1988 status quo.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Jonathan Wolman is AP's assistant bureau chief inWashington.</TEXT></DOC>
