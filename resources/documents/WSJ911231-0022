If that's the case, then the first freeelections could well be the last. If the fundamentalists dosucceed in imposing Islamic law upon Algeria, it seemsunlikely four years from now that they will allow thepossibility of God being voted out of office.   But the rise of Islamic states should not be seen as ahistorical inevitability. In Algeria, the success of thefundamentalist party, the FIS, has more to do with thefailures of the ruling socialist regime than it does with theattractions of fundamentalism.</LP><TEXT>   The ruling National Liberation Front emerged as a Marxistsuccessor to French colonial rule. Its socialist handling ofthe economy made the nation a prototypical Third Worlddisaster area. It created a huge and corrupt bureaucracy, itinvested massively and foolishly in industrial plants thatcame to nought, it squandered the oil riches of the 1970s.Food rots in the fields while unemployment in the cities isas high as 50%.   The state dominated every aspect of life, allowing noopposition until 1989. The religious arena became the onlyrefuge, and hence the focus of opposition. The state tried tocontrol even that, forcing speakers at mosques to registerwith the police. Cooptation having failed, the governmenttried repression, which only gave prestige to religiousleaders.   Given this history of political mismanagement, and thedecline in the faith in Marxism, it is not surprising thatpeople should vote against the government when finally giventhe chance. By dominating the secular world, the governmentpractically ordained that the opposition would befundamentalist. The small secular opposition registeredimportant gains in the elections, but is not yet organizedenough to rival the FIS.   The continuing tragedy of Algeria may be that havingjumped from the unwelcome pan of socialism, it finds itselfin the fire of fundamentalism. Still, the citizens who speakwith reporters haven't sounded like fundamentalist truebelievers. Mostly, they speak of ending the corruption of theruling class of bureaucrats.   Fundamentalism seems unlikely to improve economicprospects. For neighboring countries, the lesson is clear.Open up the system to secular, democratic opposition, or beburied by anger in a fundamentalist guise.</TEXT></DOC>
