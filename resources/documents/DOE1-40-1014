This is because X-Rayis sensitive to density variations and ultrasonics and scanning laseracoustic microscopy (SLAM) are sensitive to acoustic impedance variations.The grain boundaries and microporosity of the material produce a highscattering background for the acoustic methods, masking small inclusions.X-Ray is insensitive to grain boundary effects and the uniform microporosityaverages out over the material thickness. If minor inclusions are tobe detected, X-Ray must be used. Ultrasonics and SLAM are sensitive onlyto the presence of an open crack, not its width. If cracks are to bedetected, ultrasonics or SLAM must be used. SLAM is by far the fastestmethod of scanning for OD cracks, but only ultrasonics will find ID cracks.Results of this first phase study give four guidelines to tube design.First, surface irregularities are a major limitation to testing. Theeventual tests will be much more sensitive if surface finish can be improved.Second, porosity is another major limit to testing. Pores are not generallystrength limiting in this material, but pores scatter ultrasound verybadly and produce irregular densities on X-Ray film, in both cases obscuringmore important defect indications. Third, the dimple shape of the closedend is essentially untestable. The fourth design guideline is providedby the fractography results. In some cases, failure was initiated inor near clusters of large grains. Defect sizing depends upon the detectionmethods. 5 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
