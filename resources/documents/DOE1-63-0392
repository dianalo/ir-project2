Theimpact of innovation process is no more clear and especially the substitutionsexpected between different techniques. Nevertheless, these new techniquescould provoque big changes in medical practices and health care organizations.They should probably increase the proportion of ambulatory patients intotal examinations and encourage the development of extra-hospital healthcare. But, in France, alternative health care organizations (day hospital,home care, etc...) are under developed because of many non technicalfactors (behavioural managerial and institutional). Perhaps major potentialchange shall come from imaging networks. But can imaging developmentcontribute to moderate health expanses growth rate. Economic evaluationsof each new technique are difficult and ambiguous but necessary to maximizehealth care system efficiency.</TEXT></DOC>
