Israel's militia allies in south Lebanon killed three guerrillasand suffered one wounded in a gunfight.   Dozens of Jewish settlers from Ariel in the West Bank drove tothe Palestinian village of Bidya, smashed windows and burned treesand tires in a factory courtyard, Israel radio reported. It said theraid followed a firebomb attack on an Ariel vehicle and the stoningof a bus, neither of which caused injuries.   Near Kalandya, Jewish settlers whose car was attacked with stonessmashed the windows of Arab vehicles parked in the area, accordingto the radio and the news agency Itim.   Israeli politicians on the left and right lent support to theidea of elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip linked to peacetalks, said to be part of a Middle East peace plan supported by theUnited States.   As reported by the daily Haaretz, elected local Palestinianswould negotiate the first stage of a peace plan with Israel and thePalestine Liberation Organization would be excluded until latertalks on the final status of the occupied territory.   A resolution of support for Israel accepted by a conference of1,600 foreign Jews was read at Jerusalem's wailing wall, the holiestsite of Judaism.   It declared support for ``the democratically elected governmentof national unity in its efforts to achieve peace and security withits neighbors.'' Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir called the conferenceto demonstrate solidarity with Israel.   Wednesday's violence in the occupied lands took place during ageneral strike marking a battle between Palestinians and Israelis in1968.   Ahmed Abdul Fatah Ehdayed, 11, died after being shot in the chestby Israeli troops during in the Tulkarem refugee camp, doctors atTulkarem Hospital reported. They said four Palestinians were woundedin the clash, two critically.   An army spokesman confirmed the boy's death but said the army wasinvestigating whether he was killed by army gunfire. The spokesmansaid troops put a curfew on the camp to contain disturbances thatbroke out as news of the death spread.   With the boy's death, 404 Palestinians and 18 Israelis have beenkilled since the uprising against Israeli occupaion began more than15 months ago.   The worst confrontations Wednesday occurred in the Gaza Strip,where Arab doctors said 28 Palestinians were wounded despite curfewsconfining 320,000 residents of eight refugee camps, areas of GazaCity and Beit Hanoun village to their homes.   After the newspaper Haaretz reported the supposed U.S. peaceplan, Parliament member Yossi Sarid of the left-wing Citizens RightsMovement said he understood the PLO accepted the plan based on U.S.guarantees that the organization would take part in the final talks.   ``This has been accepted by the PLO, according to my knowledge,''said Sarid, who recently attended meetings in New York with PLOrepresentatives.   Cabinet Minister Ronnie Milo, a close aide to Shamir, hinted onIsrael radio that the prime minister might propose such elections aspart of a peace agenda he will present on a visit to the UnitedStates.   Milo said that whatever the sympathies of the people elected, hebelieved they would be representitive of Palestinians in theoccupied lands, ``not of somebody from Tunis'' _ meaning the PLO.   U.S. diplomats met PLO representatives in Tunis, TunisiaWednesday and asked the PLO to take ``practical steps'' to easetension in the Israeli-occupied territorites, the head of the U.S.delegation said.   The 4{-hour meeting marked the first formal talks since PresidentBush took office. The United States opened a dialogue with the PLOin December after PLO chief Yasser Arafat said he recognized Israeland renounced terrorism.   No U.S. plan has been announced in Washington, but Secretary ofState James A. Baker III said Tuesday the United States felt itwould be a ``major mistake'' to rule out eventual Israeli-PLO talksif they could lead to Middle East peace.   Baker also said the United States, in its meetings in Tunis, wasencouraging the PLO ``not to stand in the way of Palestinians in theoccupied territories engaging in a dialogue with Israel.''   The military said a patrol of the Israeli-backed South LebanonArmy militia fought the guerrillas near the Lebanese village ofHoula, about a mile north of the Israeli border.   The army command said it did not know the affiliation of thethree dead guerrillas.   The army deputy chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Ehud Barak, said thePLO violated its rejection of terror by supporting such attacks.   ``Since Arafat's declaration renouncing terrorism, we havewitnessed about 10 attempted incursions into Israel executed by avariety of PLO-affiliated organizations,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
