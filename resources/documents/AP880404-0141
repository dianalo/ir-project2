Atlanta Public Safety Commissioner George Napper appeared in thelatest in a series of ads placed by Handgun Control, aWashington-based lobbying group, featuring messages from leadinglaw enforcement officials.   In the ad's headline, Napper asks, ``Cop-killer bullets,mail-order handguns, machine guns ... has the N.R.A. gone off thedeep end?''   In the text, he urges readers to mark this year's 25thanniversary of President Kennedy's assassination and 20thanniversary of the King and Robert Kennedy assassinations by``sending Congress a message _ America wants sane handgun lawsnow!''   Napper advocates waiting periods for the purchase of handgunsand ``a national, uniform minimum standard of handgun laws.''   He blasted the NRA's efforts to repeal federal, state and localgun control laws and its defense of armor-piercing ``cop-killer''bullets, privately owned machine guns and mail-order gun sales.   Napper said Monday in a telephone interview that he has ``verystrong feelings about handguns ... the only purpose for a handgunis to kill people.''   Handgun Control officials said the Atlanta advertisements costthem about $16,000, and that the two-year series of advertisementshas cost about $750,000.   The group's vice-chairwoman, Sarah Brady, is the wife of ReaganWhite House press secretary James Brady, who was permanentlydisabled by pistol fire from would-be presidential assassin JohnHinckley.
