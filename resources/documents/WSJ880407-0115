It's the Pakistanis who are in Geneva, facing the Soviet-backed negotiators from Kabul and who've so far refused to sign a deal with the Kabul regime. For this refusal, they've been bombed. In the past two months alone, bombs have gone off in a Rawalpindi bus station, a poultry shop near the Afghan border, three sites in Bajaur and a bazaar in the refugee center of Thal. Sixteen civilians have been killed and some 42 injured in these explosions.    A chronology and analysis of the Soviet-backed campaign of terrorist bombings inside Pakistan were provided in a report this past weekend by the Associated Press. According to U.S. and Pakistani sources, &quot;The bombings started in 1985, about when Mikhail S. Gorbachev became General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, and the current Afghan leader, known by the single name of Najibullah, left the Afghan intelligence agency to become the secretary in the ruling party.&quot;    According to both Pakistani and U.S. officials, the attackers are agents of the Afghan state security agency created by the Soviet KGB. Known by its acronym, WAD, the organization employs an estimated 20,000 agents, assisted by 1,500 Soviet KGB advisers. The AP reports that &quot;WAD staged about a dozen bombings inside Pakistan in 1985, 20 in 1986, and more than 100 in 1987.&quot;    The frequency of these terrorist bombings increased dramatically in 1987, after the U.S. began supplying Stinger anti-aircraft missiles to the mujahideen. Since the start of 1987, the attacks have averaged at least one a week. Altogether, more than 400 Pakistani civilians have died and hundreds more have been injured.    None of this has received much attention. Several years ago, Soviet and Afghan pilots made regular cross-border air raids into Pakistan, which were highly publicized. But with this new wave of terrorist bombings, &quot;there hasn't been so much of a reaction,&quot; says a U.S. official. No doubt the Soviets have figured out that were so many bombs to go off in London or Paris, the West would be in an uproar, but when the terror occurs in Pakistan, it goes largely unremarked.    Whether the bombs are dropped from planes or detonated on the ground, it is clear from the targets that the aim is the same: to intimidate the Pakistanis and stir up resentment against the Afghan war. WAD agents strike not only near the refugee and rebel camps along the Afghan border, but also in such major cities as Lahore, Islamabad and Rawalpindi. The worst attack so far came in Pakistan's largest city, Karachi, last July -- three car bombs at the main bazaar killed 72 people and wounded 260.    Throughout all this, Pakistan's leaders have stood fast. They have continued to let their country serve as a conduit for weapons and a base for the Afghan rebels. Some three million Afghan refugees live across the border in Pakistan. As a result of this steadfastness over the years, the Soviets run a genuine risk of losing in Afghanistan. So while Mr. Gorbachev and his Kabul staff may be talking up peace in Geneva, his agents are also murdering people in Pakistan.    U.S. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci has just arrived in Pakistan. If he finds the Pakistanis have qualms about signing onto a peace agreement backed by Mr. Gorbachev, it will be because they know what kind of a peace they are dealing with. </TEXT></DOC>
