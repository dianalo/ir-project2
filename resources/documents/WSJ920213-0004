Despite industry objections, the government yesterdayfiled a second application seeking to patent thousands offragments of genetic material that functions in the humanbrain. The controversy was touched off last year when theNational Institutes of Health filed an unprecedented patentapplication for 347 genetic fragments discovered by NIHscientists. Many fear that the granting of such patents wouldlead to a race by the private sector to patent such fragmentsand to charge exorbitant licensing fees.</LP><TEXT>   The fragments are segments of DNA, the substance of whichgenes are made. NIH scientists say they have been able toidentify more than 2,300 genes that are &quot;expressed&quot; by braincells, 1,900 of which were previously unknown.   The government's attempt to patent these fragments hasbecome enormously contentious because the NIH scientists haveonly identified them without determining their function. Allgenes are blueprints that cells use to make proteins, andthese new-found genes apparently are used by brain cells formaking proteins. What the proteins do in the brain, however,remains unknown.   The discovery of human genes can hold the key tounderstanding many human diseases and can open the way to newtherapies. Thus, a patent on a gene can be extremely valuableto a biotechnology company. In the past, patents have beenobtained on genes whose functions were known and which had aspecific medical application.   But only with recent advances in technology havescientists been able to isolate genes without knowing thepurpose of the genes. The NIH move is the first attempt topatent genes of unknown function.   In a briefing with reporters yesterday, NIH DirectorBernadine Healy said the health institutes will continueseeking patents on genes as an &quot;interim policy&quot; while thegovernment and scientists continue to debate whether or notprotection of genes is appropriate. &quot;This is not a statementthat we believe patenting the material is the thing to do nowor in the future,&quot; Dr. Healy said.   NIH officials have repeatedly argued that they are actingin the industry's best interest. By first obtaining a patent,the government can then license it to companies to use thegene to develop a drug or &quot;socially responsible&quot; product. Thepatent will give the licensee the security to investconsiderable resources into developing the product, NIHscientists say, something that wouldn't be possible if theysimply published their findings without patent protection.   The NIH's filing yesterday reaffirms its previousapplication and seeks patents on more than 2,000 additionaldiscoveries. In addition, an article by the NIH team workingon the gene project, describing their findings, appears intoday's edition of the scientific journal Nature.   The NIH project takes laboratory-made copies of DNAfragments and determines the sequence of molecules making upshort stretches of the fragments. Tests show that thefragments are sections of DNA that a human cell can &quot;read&quot;and use for making a protein. Thus, the scientists know thatthe fragments are either genes or parts of genes, althoughthe purpose of the gene remains unknown.   &quot;I can tell you there are mixed feelings in this industryabout the advisability of the government patenting big longsequences&quot; of DNA fragments, said William Small, executivedirector of the Association of Biotechnology Companies, anorganization of more than 270 biotech concerns world-wide.&quot;There are those that are quite adamantly opposed, and thereare those that are warm about the government doing somethingbecause they feel that if that initiative is taken it will beeasier to transfer to industry because you've alreadyidentified something.&quot;   Several patent lawyers believe the government probablywon't be able to make a case for patent protection on a pieceof a gene whose function is unknown. To patent something, ithas to be unique and have an application.   &quot;I don't really think it's fair to say these sequences arediscoveries, because discovery involves some measure ofunderstanding and utility. These {would be} patented becausethey're there,&quot; said Alan Smith, senior vice president forresearch at Genzyme Corp., a Cambridge, Mass., biotechnologycompany.   &quot;These are partial fragments,&quot; acknowledged J. CraigVenter, the NIH scientist who is leading the gene-sequencingproject. &quot;But there is so much information {in them}. Thereis more specific information than is in your fingerprint foridentifying you.&quot;   The big concern of scientists isn't the NIH's holding ofthe patents, because they believe the federal institute wouldbe responsible in licensing them to companies. But they'reworried that the granting of the patents could ignite a raceamong private concerns and individuals to lay claim to asmany DNA fragments as possible.   &quot;Someone could set up a lab who knows where, sequence asmany of these things as they could get their hands on, andsit back, say let's wait for license applications . . . andcharge a lot of money,&quot; Mr. Smith said.   That is entirely possible because the NIH's Dr. Ventersaid the technology used to rapidly sequence the DNAfragments is now widely available. Much of it, he said, ismade by Applied Biosystems Inc. of Foster City, Calif., andis being used in laboratories around the world. He predictedthat by this Christmas, scientists will have identified20,000 of the 50,000 to 100,000 human genes believed toexist.</TEXT></DOC>
