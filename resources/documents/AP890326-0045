Government information officers in Kuwait, Bahrain and othergulf states said that they had no information about the incident,which reportedly occurred Thursday.   Independent Television News in Britain quoted diplomatic sourcesin Kuwait as saying the four Britons are young women who wereaboard the 82-foot yacht, owned by Kuwait's al-Sabah royal family.   The report said the yacht apparently was seized for ransom afterit strayed into a sensitive area near Iran's northern Farsi island.   It said officials leaked information to the Kuwaiti newspaperAl-Anbaa because Iran's Revolutionary Guards are demanding a ransomand negotiations between Kuwait and Iran are going badly.   Al-Anbaa first reported the story, saying the yacht had comefrom France and docked briefly at Bahrain, before leaving Thursday.Six hours after it sailed for Kuwait, a distress signal was pickedup, said the paper.   Officials at Bahrain's leading yacht club, the Marina Club, saidtheir registers showed a distress signal issued Thursday.   A man speaking English with an Arabic accent said, ``My yacht isburning. What can I do?'' according to a club official. The callerdid not respond to a request for his location.   Al-Anbaa identified those aboard the yacht only as royal familymembers from an unidentified Persian Gulf nation and four Britons.The newspaper said it had names of all those aboard but would notpublish them ``to avoid affecting the secret contacts going on withIran at the highest levels to end the incident.''   In London, Britain's foreign office said it was the first it hadheard of the report. ``We've asked our embassies in the region butthey know nothing about it,'' said a spokesman on condition ofanonymity.   Shipping executives speaking on condition of anonymity saidthere were at least two cases in recent months of ``pirates''seizing vessels in the northern gulf.   ``They just turn over people aboard to the nearest fishing boatand seize the boat,'' said one of the sources.   The pirates most likely are Iranian, the sources said.   Al-Anbaa said the yacht probably is at Farsi.   The island was used as a base for gunboats manned byRevolutionary Guards during the 8-year gulf war. The gunboats wereused to attack oil tankers and other merchant traffic in gulfshipping lanes.   Kuwait was one of Iraq's largest financial backers during thewar and registered 11 tankers in the United States because Iranmade its shipping a target. This prompted a large U.S. Navy buildupin the gulf. Iran says the U.S. Navy presence was one of themilitary setbacks that forced it to accept the Aug. 20 cease-fireending the war.   Kuwait-Iranian relations had been improving since thecease-fire. But friction surfaced March 15, when Kuwait said anumber of fugitives its government wants on charges ranging fromespionage to coup plotting were free in Iran.   A spokesman for the Iranian Embassy in Kuwait said: ``We have noinformation yet. We read the report like you in the newspaper.''</TEXT></DOC>
