The recent successof the Linear Quadratic (LQ) model in constructing isoeffect relationsfor normal tissue damage and in describing in vitro cell survival curves,indicate that this model could be used to determine this dependence.The problem of tumor control is addressed. Using LQ model parametersobtained from human tumor cell lines, the sigmoid dose-response curvesfor controlling tumors of fixed size but of several histologies, witha fractionated course of radiotherapy is obtained. Except for squamouscell carcinoma, the calculated average tumor control doses (TCD37 orTCD50) are unrealistically low, but the model can be made more realisticby including inhomogeneities in the spatial dose distribution and heterogeneoustumor cell populations. The slope of the dose response curves are determinedand the significance of the relative slope parameter rho as a measureof the number of cells in a tumor's most radioresistant clone is noted.The relation of the model's predictions to qualitative features of theexperimental animal data for both tumor control and for normal tissuedamage is discussed. Experiments to test the validity of this type ofmodel are suggested.</TEXT></DOC>
