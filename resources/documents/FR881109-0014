The proposed rule would also expandthese exemptions to permit the use of types of deferred sales loads notpreviously used. In addition, disclosure requirements for these other typesof deferred sales loads are being proposed. The Commission is proposingthe rule because deferred sales load arrangements would provide investorswith alternatives to sales loads that are charged at the time fund sharesare purchased. If adopted, the proposed rule could reduce significantlythe need for mutual funds and related persons to obtain individual exemptionsbefore imposing deferred sales loads.The Commission is also considering whether to propose amendments to twoexisting rules, and to issue revised proposed amendments to another rule.These rules permit (or in the case of the proposed rule amendments, proposeto permit), in relevant part, certain registered insurance company separateaccounts (``separate accounts'') to charge deferred sales loads. Amendmentsare now being considered because the issues under review in the mutualfund deferred sales load area also apply to separate accounts. The Commissionis requesting comment on insurance considerations relevant to the questionsof whether and how amendments to these rules should be implemented.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be received on or before January 9, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Send comments in triplicate to Jonathan G.

Additionally, the Commission is asking for public commenton insurance considerations pertaining to whether, and, if so, how rules6c-8 [17 CFR 270.6c-8], 6e-3(T) [17 CFR 270.6e-3(T)] and 6e-2 [17 CFR 270.6e-2]under the Act should be amended.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Summary</ITAG>Proposed rule 6c-10 would provide broad exemptions from sections 2(a)(32),2(a)(35), 22(c) and 22(d) of the Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(32), 80a-2(a)(35),80a-22(c) and 80a-22(d), respectively] and rule 22c-1 under the Act [17CFR 270.22c-1] to permit a registered open-end management investment company(other than a registered insurance company separate account) (``mutualfund'' or ``fund''),\1\<NOTE/> its principal underwriter, dealers in the fund's shares,and persons authorized to consummate transactions in the fund's shares,to impose a deferred sales load, subject to specified conditions.\2\<NOTE/> The deferred sales load could be deducted either upon redemptionor in installments over time.\3\<NOTE/> Proposed rule 6c-10 is intended, therefore, to permit fundsto provide investors the opportunity to pay distribution costs on a deferredbasis. The proposal should be read together with the recently proposedamendments to rule 12b-1 [17 CFR 270.12b-1] under the Act.\4\<NOTE/> The conditions in the proposal, which are based on conditionsdeveloped in the context of a series of exemptive orders issued by theCommission, are designed to (i) provide investors with alternatives tosales loads that are paid at the time of purchase, and (ii) permit fundsto charge and administer deferred sales loads in a manner substantiallycomparable to front-end sales loads.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Paragraph (c)(1) of the proposed rule would provide that,for purposes of this rule, a registered open-end management investmentcompany includes a separate series of such a company. <T3>See infra </T3>notes 59-60 and accompanying text. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ While the following discussion refers generally to theimposition of deferred sales loads by mutual funds, the proposed rule wouldprovide exemptions to funds, their principal underwriters, dealers in fundshares, and persons authorized to consummate transactions in fund shares.Such exemptions are necessary because sections 22(c) and 22(d) of the Act,and rule 22c-1 thereunder, apply to all such parties. In addition, anyof these parties may actually administer the deferred sales load.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Paragraph (c)(3) of the proposed rule defines the term``deferred sales load'' to mean any amount properly chargeable to salesor promotional expenses that is or may be deducted directly from a shareholder'saccount in one or more installments during the term of the investment,or upon the redemption of fund shares, or both. Accordingly, proposed rule6c-10 would not provide exemptions for the deduction of an amount designatedas a deferred sales load where the facts and circumstances indicate thatthe payment is not intended to cover sales or promotional expenses, butis intended to achieve some other purpose, such as to deter or restrictredemptions.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Rule 12b-1 permits mutual funds to use a portion of fundassets to finance the distribution of fund shares, provided that certainprocedural and substantive conditions are satisfied. The Commission proposedamendments to rule 12b-1 in Investment Company Act Rel. No. 16431 (June13, 1988) [53 FR 23258, June 21, 1988] (``Release 16431'').Many of the exemptive orders issued by the Commission permit the use ofdeferred sales loads on shares of existing funds and other funds that mightbe created subsequent to the orders, the shares of which would be distributedby the same or related underwriters on substantially the same basis. Proposedrule 6c-10 would be prospective in effect to the extent that any fund inexistenceat the time rule 6c-10 is adopted that charges a deferred sales load inreliance on a Commission order would be able to continue to rely on thatorder after adoption of the rule. However, any fund organized subsequentto the adoption of the rule that wishes to impose a deferred sales loadwould be required to comply with the provisions of the rule and would notbe permitted to rely on a prior Commission order. Compliance with the rulealso would be required of any existing fund that, after the adoption ofthe rule, wishes to impose a deferred sales load. Comment is requestedas to whether <T3>all </T3>funds that charge deferred sales loads in reliance on priororders should be required to comply with the provisions of rule 6c-10,when adopted. The Commission also is considering whether to propose amendments to rules6c-8 and 6e-3(T), and issue revised proposed amendments to rule 6e-2 underthe Act. Rule 6c-8 permits the imposition of a deferred sale load on variablyannuity contracts issued by separate accounts. Rule 6e-3(T), in pertinentpart, provides exemptions to permit separate accounts to impose a deferredsales load on flexible premium variable life insurance contracts (``flexiblepremium contracts''). Similarly, the proposed amendments to rule 6e-2 would,in part, permit the imposition of a deferred sales load by separate accountsoffering scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts (``scheduledpremium contracts'').\5\<NOTE/> The Commission is requesting comment on insurance considerationsrelevant to proposing amendments to these rules to conform the rules toproposed rule 6c-10. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\<T3> See </T3>Investment Company Act Rel. No. 14421 (Mar. 15, 1985) [50FR 11709, Mar. 25, 1985] (proposed amendments to rule 6e-2). <ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>Mutual funds engaged in a continuous public offering of redeemable securities.Until fairly recently, most of the sales and promotional expenses associatedwith this offering were passed on to fund investors in the form of a salescharge or ``sales load'' paid by the investor at the time fund shares werepurchased and expressed as a percentage of the public offering price ofthe shares.\6\<NOTE/> Funds that sold their shares to the public without a salesload formerly represented only a small portion of the industry.\7\<NOTE/> However, the number and asset size of so-called ``no-load''funds increased dramatically in the 1970's.\8\<NOTE/> This increased competition from no-load funds and a perceivedresistance among mutual fund investors to products that charge front-endsales loads have prompted load funds to develop alternative methods ofdistribution financing, such as the imposition of sales loads payable otherthan at the time of purchase. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\<T3> See generally Report of the Securities and Exchange Commission onthe Public Policy Implications of Investment Company Growth, </T3>H.R.Rep. No. 2337, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 51-56, 201-209 (1966) (hereinafter``Public Policy Implications''). Where the proceeds of sales loads wereinsufficient to cover all distribution expenses, the excess was borne bythe fund's investment adviser, either directly or through the operationof an affiliated underwriter. <T3>Id. </T3>at 209. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\<T3> See id. </T3>at 204 n. 7. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ No load funds generally are distributed directly to theinvesting public by the fund organization, without the intervention ofa retail network of broker-dealers. The lower distribution costs that resultfrom this arrangement were traditionally paid by the fund's investmentadviser or principal underwriter out of its own resources. In recent years,many of such funds have paid for distribution out of fund assets by adoptingdistribution plans under rule 12b-1. Other directly distributed funds haveimposed relatively modest front-end sales loads on their shares and havebecome known as ``low-load'' funds. The practice of imposing deferred sales loads originated with separateaccounts. In 1979, one such account was granted exemptions from severalprovisions of the Act to permit the imposition of a ``contingent deferredsales load'' (``CDSL'') \9\<NOTE/> on variable annuity contracts issued by that account.\10\<NOTE/> The CDSLs were to be paid when all or part of a shareholder'sinterest in the separate account was either redeemed from the account orconverted to an annuity. Exemptions were sought because the provisionsof the Act do not specifically address situations where investment companies,whether separate accounts or mutual funds, charge sales loads payable otherthan at the time of purchase.\11\<NOTE/> Subsequent to the 1979 order, the Commission received numeroussimilar requests for exemptions from separate accounts seeking to imposeCDSLs on variable annuity contracts.\12\<NOTE/> The Commission codified those exemptions in 1983 when itadopted rule 6c-8 under the Act.\13\<NOTE/> Following that, the Commission adopted rule 6e-3(T) for flexiblepremium contracts and proposed amendments to rule 6e-2 for scheduled premiumcontracts, broad exemptive rules which include provisions that permit (orin the case of rule 6e-2, proposed to permit) a separate account to deducta sales load upon redemption, as well as in installments from a contractowner'saccount.\14\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ As discussed in more detail below, a CDSL is a deferredsales load that is paid, if at all, at the time of redemption, the amountof which would decrease to zero if the shares were held for a reasonableperiod of time specified by the fund. <T3>See infra </T3>text accompanying notes 17-23. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ <T3>See </T3>Nationwide Life Insurance Company and MFS Variable Account,Investment Company Act Rel.

Mutual funds and related persons thatdesire to charge a sales load payable other than at the time of purchasemust first obtain exemptions from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), and 22(c)of the Act, and rule 22c-1 under the Act.

Theprincipal underwriter then recovers the amounts expended through paymentsunder the fund's 12b-1 plan.\20\<NOTE/> However, because 12b-1 plans provide that annual paymentsfor distribution may not exceed a specified percentage of the fund's averagenet assets, or some similar ceiling, it may be several years before theprincipal underwriter can recover fully the amounts expended on the fund'sbehalf. According to Applicants, this delay in payment raises the possibilitythat a shareholder will redeem fund shares before the payments under thefunds's 12b-1 plan have reimbursed fully the principal underwriter forexpenses incurred in connection with the sale of those shares. Thus, Applicantshave sought to impose on each redeeming shareholder a CDSL designed toapproximate the amount of unreimbursed expenses.\21\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ <T3>See, e.g.,</T3> Eaton Vance California Municipals Trust, InvestmentCompany Act Rel.

Because the imposition of a CDSL would causea redeeming shareholder to receive an amount less than net asset valueof redeemed shares, Applicants have requested an exemption from section2(a)(32) to the extent necessary to have shares subject to a CDSL be considered``redeemable securities'' for purposes of the Act.\25\<NOTE/> In support of their position, Applicants have maintainedthat, although the imposition of a CDSL, in effect, could cause the shareholderto receive an amount less than the net asset value of his redeemed shares,payment of a CDSL does not prevent a redeeming shareholder from receivinghis proportionate share of the fund's current net asset value. Rather,Applicants have argued that payment of a CDSL constitutes only the paymentof the same sales load that could have been charged when the shares werepurchased.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\25\ One consequence of a determination that a security subjectto a CDSL is not a ``redeemable security'' under section 2(a)(32) is thatthe fund issuing the security could not meet the definition of an ``open-endcompany'' contained in section 5(a)(1) of the Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-5(a)(1)].Section 5(a)(1) defines an ``open-end company'' as a ``management companywhich is offering for sale or has outstanding any redeemable security ofwhich it is the issuer.''Section 2(a)(35) defines the term ``sales load'' to be an amount properlychargeable to sales or promotional expenses that are paid at the time thesecurities are purchased.\26\<NOTE/> Because CDSLs are not charged at the time of purchase, Applicantsroutinely have requested an exemption from section 2(a)(35). Applicantshave maintained that a CDSL, in essence, is a sales load because a CDSLis used to pay expenses relating to sales and promotional activities, andthat the basic nature of a CDSL as a sales charge is not changed by thefact that payment is deferred and made contingent upon the occurrence ofa certain event.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\26\ Section 2(a)(35) of the Act defines ``sales load'' as[t]he difference between the price of a security to the public and thatportion of the proceeds from its sale which is received and invested orheld for investment by the issuer (or in the case of a unit investmenttrust, by the depositor or trustee), less any portion of such differencededucted for trustee's or custodian's fees, insurance premiums, issue taxes,or administrative expenses or fees which are not properly chargeable tosales or promotional activities. In the case of a periodic payment plancertificate, ``sales load'' includes the sales load on any investment companysecurities in which the payments made on such certificates are invested,as well as the sales load on the certificate itself.Section 22(c) of the Act and rule 22c-1 thereunder require that the priceof a redeemable security issued by a fund, for purposes of sale, redemptionand repurchase, be based on the fund's current net asset value. Becausea CDSL would cause a redeeming shareholder to receive an amount less thanthe net asset value of the redeemed shares, Applicants have sought an exemptionfrom this section and rule, arguing that the redemption price of sharessubject to a CDSL is based on current net asset value, and that a CDSLimposed at the time shares are redeemed simply is deducted from the redemptionprice in arriving at the net proceeds payable to the shareholder.Section 22(d) of the Act requires a mutual fund, its principal underwriter,and any dealer in redeemable securities issued by a fund to sell securitiesonly at a current public offering price described in the fund's prospectus.Because sales loads (<T3>i.e.,</T3> front-end sales loads) have traditionally been a componentof the public offering price, section 22(d) has required historically thatall investors be charged the same load.\27\<NOTE/> Funds seeking to charge different amounts of sales loadsto different classes of investors or for different classes of transactionswere, therefore, required to seek an exemption from section 22(d). Theseapplications were codified in rule 22d-1 under the Act [17 CFR 270.22d-1].\28\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\27\ <T3>See</T3> Investment Company Act Rel. No. 13183 (Apr. 22, 1983) [48FR 1987, May 3, 1983], in which the Commission proposed rule 22d-6 (laterrenumbered rule 22d-1) under the Act. <T3>See also</T3> Public Policy Implications, <T3>supra</T3> note 6, at 221.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\ Rule 22d-1 was adopted in Investment Company Act Rel.No. 14390 (Feb. 22, 1985) [50 FR 7909, Feb. 27, 1985]. Rule 22d-1 providesthat the issuer, principal underwriter, or dealer in redeemable securitiesmay sell those securities at prices that reflect scheduled variations in,or elimination of, the sales load for particular classes of shareholdersor transactions, provided that (1) the scheduled variation is applied uniformlyto all offerees in the class specified; (2) the fund furnishes to existingshareholders and prospective investors adequate information concerningany scheduled variation as prescrdibed in applicable registration statementform requirements; (3) the fund revises its prospectus and statement ofadditional information to describe any new variation prior to making thevariation available to purchasers; and (4) the fund informs existing shareholdersof the new variation within one year of the date the variation is firstmade available to purchasers of the fund's shares.By its terms, rule 22d-1 applies to the sale of redeemable securities ``atprices that reflect scheduled variations in, or elimination of, the salesload.'' Because this language contemplates sales loads paid at the timeof purchase, the exemption provided by rule 22d-1 does not extend to scheduledvariations in deferred sales loads. Therefore, Applicants seeking to offerscheduled variations in, or elimination of, CDSLs to specified classesof investors, or in connection with specified classes of transactions,have requested exemptions from section 22(d).\29\<NOTE/> In seeking these exemptions, Applicants have representedthat either the scheduled variations would be imposed subject to the conditionsset forth in rule 22d-1 under the Act for scheduled variations in front-endsales loads, or the scheduled variations would satisfy equivalent conditionsset forth in the particular application.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\ For example, many Applicants stated that the CDSL wouldbe waived if the shares were redeemed under such circumstances as (1) thedeath or disability of the shareholder; (2) certain distributions fromIndividual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) or other qualified retirement plans;(3) involuntary redemptions of accounts; or (4) redemptions effected byemployees, and spouses and minor children of those employees of the fund,investment adviser, or underwriter. <T3>See, e.g.,</T3> Shearson Lehman Asset Allocation Fund, Investment CompanyAct Rel.

Applicantsrepresented that a CDSL would be more advantageous to shareholders thana front-end sales load because shareholders would have a greater amountof money available for investment at the time of purchase.

However, none of the exemptive ordersissued by the Commission permit the imposition of a CDSL that could exceedthe maximum front-end sales load permitted under Article III, section 26(d)of the Rules of Fair Practice of the National Association of SecuritiesDealers (``NASD Rules'').<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\32\ <T3>See supra</T3> notes 22-23 and accompanying text.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion</ITAG>A. Proposed Rule 6c-10Proposed rule 6c-10 would provide exemptions to permit the use of a deferredsales load, including a CDSL, provided that certain conditions are met.The proposal would obviate the need for funds to obtain individual exemptiveorders prior to charging CDSLs. The proposed rule would also permit a fundto use other types of deferred sales loads, such as a sales load deductedin one or more installments over time. Any combination of front-end andcontingent or non-contingent deferred sales loads would be permissible.The proposed rule is intended to provide greater flexibility to mutualfunds in their distribution arrangements. In this regard, the proposalshould be read together with the recently proposed amendments to rule 12b-1under the Act; \33\<NOTE/> the proposal seeks to afford shareholders the alternativeof deferring payments for distribution without the use of 12b-1 plans.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\33\ <T3>See</T3> Release 16431, <T3>supra</T3> note 4, at n.84. In Release 16431, the Commission notedthat proposed rule 6c-10 would be forthcoming. <T3>Id.</T3>The availability of proposed rule 6c-10 would be subject to specific conditions.These conditions would: (i) Require funds to calculate the amount of adeferred sales load payable upon redemption as being the lesser of theamount that represents a specified percentage of the net asset value ofthe shares at the time of purchase, or the amount that represents the sameor a lower percentage of the net asset value of the shares at the timeof redemption; (ii) prohibit funds from charging a deferred sales load,or combination of deferred sales load and front-end sales load, that exceedsthe maximum sales charge that could have been imposed at the time the shareswere purchased under Article III, section 26(d) of the Rules of Fair Practiceof the National Association of Securities Dealers (``NASD Rules''); (iii)prohibit funds from charging any amount to shareholders or to the fundthat represents interest, or any similar or related charge, on the unpaidbalance of a deferred sales load; (iv) prohibit funds from charging a deferredsales load on any amount that represents an increase in the value of fundshares due to capital appreciation; (v) prohibit funds from imposing adeferred sales load on shares, or amounts representing shares, purchasedthrough the reinvestment of dividends or capital gains distributions; (vi)require funds that impose a deferred sales load, all or part of which ispayable at the time of redemption, to calculate the amount of the loadby considering all shares, or amounts respresenting shares, that are notsubject to any deferred sales load to be redeemed first, with all othershares to be considered redeemed in the order purchased, unless a differentorder is used that would result in a lower deferred sales load; and (vii)permit funds to offer scheduled variations in, or elimination of, deferredsales loads for particular classes of shareholders or transactions, subjectto the substantive conditions applicable to front-end sales loads underrule 22d-1. In addition, the proposed rule would prohibit funds that chargedeferred sales loads from holding themselves out or being held out as ``no-load''funds or being promoted in a manner that is likely to convey to investorsthe impression that no charges for sales or promotional expenses are imposedon fund shares. The conditions are intended to: (i) Reduce investor confusion concerningthe amount of deferred sales loads that could be charged and the scheduleof any installment payments to be made, (ii) provide shareholders the alternativeof deferring sales load payments while minimizing the prospect of thesepayments being imposed to impede the redemption of fund shares,\3\\4\<NOTE/> and (iii) provide that deferred sales loads be imposed andadministered in a manner substantially comparable to front-end sales loads.Most of the conditions are based on those developed by the Commission inissuing exemptive orders on individual applications for CDSLs.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\4\ While there may be benefits to deferring sales loadpayments, it should be noted that where a fund imposes a 12b-1 fee togetherwith a deferred sales load, the benefits of deferral are diminished, particularlyif the fund must pay interest on amounts advanced by the principal underwriterin anticipation of reimbursement. <T3>See</T3> Release 16431, <T3>supra</T3> note 4, at n.90 and accompanying text.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Scope of the Rule</ITAG>Paragraph (c)(3) of the proposed rule defines the term ``deferred salesload'' to mean ``any amount properly chargeable to sales or promotionalexpenses that is or may be deducted directly from a shareholder's accountin one or more installments during the term of the investment, or uponredemption, or both.'' \3\\5\<NOTE/> Under that definition, a fund could impose a sales load thatis payable by the shareholder while the shares are being held, or uponredemption of the shares, or both. For example, the proposed rule wouldpermit a fund to offer shareholders the option of paying a deferred salesload in installments payable out of the shareholder's account at specifiedintervals. If the shareholder redeemed before the load was fully paid,the balance could be deducted from the redemption proceeds.\3\\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\5\ Since a CDSL is a type of deferred sales load, allreferences in the proposed rule to deferred sales loads include CDSLs.Paragraph (c)(4) of the proposed rule defines a CDSL to be ``a deferredsales load that is paid, if at all, at the time of redemption, the amountof which would decrease to zero if the shares were held for a reasonableperiod of time specified by the company.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\6\ Regardless of how the deferred sales load is to bepaid, the maximum amount of the deferred sales load that could be imposedand the schedule of any installment payments would have to be disclosedproperly in the fund's prospectus. <T3>See infra</T3> notes 61-66 and accompanying text.By providing an exemption to permit deferred sales loads, regardless ofwhether the deferred sales load is subject to any contingency, proposedrule 6c-10 would facilitate providing investors with alternatives to salesloads that are charged at the times fund shares are purchased. In addition,although no exemptive applications have been received from Applicants seekingto impose deferred sales loads other than CDSLs,\3\\7\<NOTE/> such arrangements raise few issues that have not been addressedin the context of CDSLs,\3\\8\<NOTE/> and there is no apparent reason to distinguish between CDSLsand other types of deferred sales loads.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\7\ While no exemptive applications have been receivedfrom Applicants seeking to impose deferred sales loads other than CDSLs,the Division has received a number of informal inquiries on the subject.The subject has also been raised in an article on a related topic. <T3>See</T3> Gardiner, <T3>Mutual Fund Financing of Share Distribution Expenses,</T3> 20 Reviewof Securities and Commodities Regulation 77, 83 (May 13, 1987) (``Gardiner'').<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\8\ The Commission also has had extensive experience inreviewing a variety of deferred sales load arrangements in the contextof separate accounts. <T3>See supra</T3> notes 9-14 and accompanying text.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Calculation of Deferred Sales Loads</ITAG>In the majority of the CDSL exemptive applications, Applicants have, ineffect, represented that, when a share subject to a CDSL is redeemed, themaximum CDSL payable on that share will be determined as a specified percentageof the share's net asset value at the time it was purchased. By calculatingthe CDSL as a percentage of net asset value at the time of purchase, ratherthan as a percentage of net asset value at the time of redemption, Applicants,in effect, permit investors to ignore the possibility of a higher salesload payment resulting from market appreciation.\3\\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\9\ For example, a 5 percent maximum CDSL on a share whosenet asset value at the time of purchase was $100, but at the time of redemptionhad risen to $150, would be $5, not $7.50.<ITAG tagnum="28">Applicants have used different terminology to express this methodof calculation. For instance, most Applicants represented that the maximumamount of the CDSL would be calculated as a percentage of the ``purchaseprice'' of the redeemed securities. Since in the context of a deferredsales load, the entire amount paid is invested, the term ``purchase price''is simply another way to express the net asset value of the redeemed sharesat the time of purchase.</ITAG>Subject to one exception, described below, this method of calculation wouldbe incorporated into paragraph (a)(1)(i) of proposed rule 6c-10. In addition,paragraph (a)(1)(ii) would provide that if a fund imposes a deferred salesload payable in installments, each installment payment would have to beexpressed either as specified dollar amount or calculated as a specifiedpercentage of the net asset value at the time of purchase. These requirementsare intended to enable shareholders both to (i) calculate readily, at thetime of investment, the total deferred sales loads that could be chargedand (ii) compare deferred sales loads charged by competing funds.\4\\0\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\0\ By requiring that deferred sales loads be calculatedas a percentage of the net asset value at the time of purchase, the proposedrule also is intended to make it easier for shareholders to compare fundsthat charge a deferred sales load with funds that charge a combinationof a front-end sales load and deferred sales load. Form N-1A requires front-endsales loads to be calculated as a percentage of the net amount invested,as well as a percentage of the public offering price.Although the maximum CDSLs payable under the exemptive orders are calculatedgenerally as a specified percentage of the net asset value of the sharesat the time they were purchased, many Applicants stipulated that a lowerCDSL would be imposed on redeemed shares whose net asset value had declinedsince they were purchased. This reduction in CDSL was accomplished by applyingthe same specified percentage to the reduced net asset value, rather thanto the original, higher, net asset value at the time of purchase.\4\\1\<NOTE/> Proposed paragraph 6c-10(a)(1)(i) would essentially codifythese orders and also require this practice for other deferred sales loadspayable upon redemption.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\1\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Keystone American Equity Income Fund, Investment CompanyAct Rel. Nos. 15633 (Mar. 19, 1987) [52 FR 9598, Mar. 25, 1987] (noticeof application) and 15684 (Apr. 15, 1987) (order); MetLife-State StreetEquity Trust, Investment Company Act Rel. Nos. 15072 (Apr. 24, 1986) [51FR 16244, May 1, 1986] (notice of application) and 15107 (May 19, 1986)(order).Specifically, paragraph (a)(1)(i) of the proposed rule would require anyfund that imposes a deferred sales load payable upon redemption to calculatethe deferred sales load as being the lesser of the (i) amount that representsa stated percentage of the net asset value of the shares at the time ofpurchase, or (ii) the amount that represents the same or a lower percentageof the net asset value of the shares at the time of redemption. All otherprovisions of rule 6c-10 would also have to be satisfied. Thus, for example,funds would remain subject to paragraph (a)(4) of the proposed rule, whichwould prohibit the imposition of a deferred sales load on any amount whichrepresents capital appreciation.\4\\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\2\ The rule would not permit, for example, a deferredsales load to be set at 2 percent of the net asset value of the sharesat the time of redemption, subject to a cap of 7 percent of the value ofthe shares at the time of purchase. To do so would permit a sales loadon capital appreciation until the cap was reached, in contravention ofparagraph (a)(4). For more discussion of the capital appreciation issue,<T3>see infra </T3>text following note 52.Funds that charge deferred sales loads payable upon redemption would berequired to use this method of calculation so that, in a falling market,an investor would not pay a deferred sales load upon redemption that wouldbe higher as a percentage of the investor's total account than would havebeen the case had the investor paid the load at the time of purchase. Withoutsuch a requirement, the proportionate increase in the impact of a salesload might impinge on an investor's freedom to redeem shares.\4\\3\<NOTE/> The Commission specifically requests comment as to whetherthis method of calculation should be permissive rather than mandatory.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\3\ <T3>See supra </T3>note 25 and accompanying text.Paragraph (a)(1)(ii) would permit, but not require, a fund that imposesa deferred sales load payable on an installment basis to calculate thedeferred sales load as being the lesser of (i) the amount that representsa stated percentage of the net asset value of the shares at the time ofpurchase, or (ii) the amount that represents the same or a lower percentageof the net asset value of the shares at the time the installment is paid,provided again that all other provisions of rule 6c-10 are satisfied. Theintent of this provision is to permit a fund that imposes a deferred salesload payable on an installment basis to impose a lower deferred sales loadin a falling market. Unlike the comparable provision in proposed paragraph(a)(1)(i), however, proposed paragraph (a)(1)(ii) would be permissive.The Commission is not proposing to require this method of calculation becausethe concern that deferred sales loads would be imposed in such a manneras to impede the redemption of fund shares is not releveant to deferredsales load payable on an installment basis. The Commission is also concernedthat possible investor confusion and difficulties relating to the computationof the sales load would outweigh the benefits that would otherwise existby using this method of calculation. However, the Commission specificallyrequests comment on whether, in the context of installment payments, thismethod of calculation should be mandatory rather than permissive.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Reference to the NASD Rules of Fair Practice</ITAG>Paragraph (a)(2) of proposed rule 6c-10 would limit exemptions to thosefunds whose maximum amount of all front-end and deferred sales loads donot exceed the maximum sales charge permissible as a front-end sales loadunder Article III, section 26(d) of the NASD Rules.\44\<NOTE/> As stated earlier, none of the exemptive orders issued bythe Commission permit the imposition of a CDSL that would exceed the maximumfront-end sales load permitted under the NASD Rules. In addition, Applicantsthat sought to charge both a front-end sales load and a CDSL have stipulatedthat the aggregate of the front-end sales load and the maximum CDSL payablewould not exceed the NASD limitations.\45\<NOTE/> Accordingly, paragraph (a)(2) would codify this practiceand apply it to the other types of deferred sales loads permissible underthe proposed rule. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\44\ Article III, section 26(d)(1) of the NASD Rules statesthat the ``maximum sales charge on any transaction shall not exceed 8.5%of the offering price.'' The section also establishes lower maximum salescharges where fund investors are not given certain favorable treatementwith respect to dividend reinvestment and quantity discounts on sales chargesimposed on single and multiple share purchases. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\45\ <T3>See supra </T3>note 31 and accompanying text. Article III, section 26(d) of the NASD Rules was adopted in 1975 underthe authority granted to the NASD by section 22(b) of the Act [15 U.S.C.80a-22(b)]. The authority was granted to the NASD as part of the 1970 amendmentsto the Act,\46\<NOTE/> and reflects a Congressional judgment that sales loads onmutual fund shares should allow for both reasonable compensation for salespersonnel, broker-dealers and underwriters, and reasonable sales loadsto shareholders.\47\<NOTE/> While section 22(b) and the NASD Rules speak in terms ofsales loads or charges that are included in the public offering price offund shares, it would be in accordance with the purpose of those provisionsto prohibit funds relying on the proposed rule from charging deferred salesloads that, alone or in combination with front-end sales loads, would exceedthe maximum charge permissible under the NASD Rules.\48\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\46\ <T3>See </T3>Investment Company Amendments Act of 1970, Pub.

As stated previously, the majority of Applicants have been funds that usea combination of a CDSL and a 12b-1 plan as a substitute for charging investorsa front-end sales load.\49\<NOTE/> Payments under 12b-1 plans are often used to pay sales commissionsand other types of distribution costs traditionally covered by sales loads.\50\<NOTE/> Accordingly, comment is requested on whether funds with 12b-1plans should be prohibited from imposing a deferred sales load where thetotal of all front-end sales loads, deferred sales loads, and 12b-1 feesexceeds the NASD maximum, and whether any distinction should be drawn insuch circumstances between non-contingent deferred sales loads and CDSLs.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\49\ <T3>See supra </T3>notes 19-21 and accompanying text. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\50\ <T3>See Release 16431, </T3><T3>supra </T3>note 4, at text following n.122. The Commission has recentlyproposed that the term ``asset-based sales load'' be used to refer to paymentsmade under 12b-1 plans. <T3>See id. </T3>at n.194 and accompanying text. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Interest, Carrying and Finance Charges </ITAG>Proposed paragraph 6c-10(a)(3) would prohibit a fund from imposing a deferredsales load if any charge is imposed on shareholders or the fund that isintended to be a payment of interest or similar charge on the amount ofload deferred. Moreover, any penalty or fee charged upon early paymentof a deferred sales load would be considered an interest charge and would,therefore, be prohibited by proposed paragraph (a)(3). Like the exemptions previously granted under section 6(c) of the Act, proposedrule 6c-10 is premised on the recognition that deferred sales loads maybe preferable to some investors in lieu of front-end sales loads becauseinvestors may have more money available for investment at the time of purchase.This possible benefit would be greatly diminished, if not eliminated, iffunds were allowed to impose interest or similar charges on the amountof load deferred.\5\\1\<NOTE/> Nevertheless, the possibility exists that some investorsmay be willing to pay interest on the amount of sales load deferred ifthe interest rate charged is less than the expected rate of appreciationof the investment. Accordingly, the Commission requests comment on whetherfunds should be permitted to charge interest on the amount of the loaddeferred.\5\\2\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\1\While none of the Applicants impose interest or similarcharges on shareholders for the amount of sales loads deferred under aCDSL, many funds that charge 12b-1 fees and CDSLs do pay interest on amountsadvanced by the principal underwriter in anticipation of reimbursement.<T3>See supra </T3>note 34. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\2\At least one commentator has raised the issue of whetherthe use of deferred sales load arrangements should be considered an extensionof credit on mutual fund shares that would be prohibited under section11(d)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78k(d)(1)].<T3>See </T3>Gardiner, <T3>supra </T3>note 37, at 83. Neither the Commission nor its staff hasformally addressed this issue in the past. Nevertheless, the Commissionis aware that, while such arrangements may be viewed as involving an extensionof credit whether or not there is an explicit interest charge, the staffof the Division of Market Regulation has informally indicated that it wouldnot regard the use of deferred sales charges on mutual funds as prohibitedby section 11(d)(1). <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Capital Appreciation of Fund Shares </ITAG>Paragraph (a)(4) of the proposed rule would prohibit a fund from imposinga deferred sales load on any amount that represents an increase in thevalue of fund shares due to capital appreciation. Virtually all Applicantshave represented that no CDSL will be imposed on such amounts. A salesload on capital appreciation would essentially constitute a performance-basedsales load. Such a sales load would also be inconsistent with the argumentthat deferral of a sales load is mainly a matter of timing and does notaffect the amount or nature of the charge. Thus, paragraph (a)(4) wouldcodify a condition of prior exemptive orders, and would apply the restrictionto other types of deferred sales loads permissible under the rule. <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Reinvested Dividends and Capital Gains Distributions </ITAG>Paragraph (a)(5) of the proposed rule would prohibit the imposition ofa deferred sales load on shares purchased through the reinvestment of dividendsor captial gains distributions. Applicants for exemptions generally haverepresented that no CDSL will be imposed on such shares.\5\\3\<NOTE/> Paragraph (a)(5) would, therefore, codify this conditionof prior exemptive orders, and apply it to the other types of deferredsales loads permissible under the proposed rule. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\3\<T3>But see supra </T3>note 22. Although virtually no fund presently charges a CDSL on shares acquiredthrough the reinvestment of dividends, some funds do impose a front-endsales load on such shares. Accordingly, comment is requested on whethera fund should be permitted to impose a deferred sales load on shares purchasedthrough dividend reinvestment. <ITAG tagnum="81">7. Order of Redemption </ITAG>Paragraph (a)(6) of the proposed rule would require a fund that imposesa deferred sales load, all or part of which is paid at the time of redemption,to calculate the amount of the load by considering all shares, or amountsrepresenting shares, that are not subject to any deferred sales load tobe redeemed first. Thus, the first shares or amounts to be redeemed wouldbe those attributable to capital appreciation, the reinvestment of dividendsand capital gains distributions, or to a scheduled variation in the load.Other shares or amounts would then be considered to be redeemed in theorder purchased, unless the fund chose to redeem in another order thatwould result in a lower sales load. Proposed paragraph (a)(6), which ismodeled on representations made in a majority of CDSL exemptive applications,\5\\4\<NOTE/> is intended to require redemptions in an order that (i) allowsinvestors to receive the maximum benefit from shares not subject to anydeferred sales load, (ii) is easily disclosed to and understood by shareholders,and (iii) is compatible with existing bookkeepng systems developed forfunds that charge CDSLs.\5\\5\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\4\<T3>See supra </T3>note 23 and accompanying text. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\5\<T3>Id.</T3> Given the high degree of control that a fund's investment adviser or principalunderwriter may have over the order of redemption, and the fact that theunderwriter would benefit from an order that results in the payment ofa higher sales load or in the earlier payment of a load, the inclusionof a specific provision in the proposed rule would appear necessary. Paragraph(a)(6) of the proposed rule would, however, permit a different order ifthe alternative order would result in the redeeming shareholder payinga lower deferred sales load than would be payable under the order specifiedin the rule.<ITAG tagnum="81">8. Scheduled Variations</ITAG>Paragraph (a)(7) of proposed rule 6c-10 would permit a fund to offer ascheduled variation in, or the elimination of, a deferred sales load toclasses of shareholders or in connection with classes of transactions specifiedby the fund, as long as the fund complies with the substantive provisionsof rule 22d-1 under the Act.56<NOTE/> Proposed paragraph (a)(7), therefore, would require a fundthat offers a scheduled variation to (i) apply the scheduled variationuniformly to all offerees in the specified class; (ii) furnish to existingand prospective shareholders adequate information concerning the scheduledvariation as prescribed in applicable registration statement form requirements;(iii) revise its prospectus and statement of additional information todescribe the new variation prior to making the sales load variation availableto purchasers of fund shares; and (iv) advise existing fund shareholdersof any new scheduled variation within one year of the date such variationis first made available to purchasers of fund shares.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>56 <T3>See supra </T3>note 28.As discussed previously, the Commission has received a large number ofrequests for exemption from section 22(d) from Applicants that wish tooffer the sale of securities subject to scheduled variations in or theelimination of a CDSL.57<NOTE/> The Commission has granted such exemptions based generallyon representations that scheduled variations would be imposed either incompliance with the provisions of rule 22d-1 or equivalent conditions.Paragraph (a)(7) would codify the conditions of prior orders and applythe conditions to other types of deferred sales loads permissible underthe rule. By requiring compliance with the substantive provisions of rule22d-1, the proposed rule would provide that scheduled variations in deferredsales loads would be subject to the same restrictions applicable to front-endsales loads.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>57 <T3>See Supra </T3>note 27-29 and accompanying text.Paragraph (a)(7) of the proposed rule also would permit a fund to offeran existing shareholder any new scheduled variation that would waive orreduce the amount of a deferred sales load that had not yet been paid bythe shareholder. Rule 22d-1(c), which would be among the substantive requirementsincorporated by reference into proposed paragraph (a)(7), requires a fundto amend its prospectus and statement of additional information <T3>before </T3>making any new scheduled variation in a front-end salesload available to purchasers of fund shares. However, a literal applicationof rule 22d-1(c) to deferred sales loads arguably could prevent a fundfrom offering the benefit of a new scheduled variation to a shareholderwho had already purchased his shares, but had not yet paid any or all ofthe deferred sales load. Paragraph (a)(7) would state specifically thatthis practice is permissible. Of course, before the variation is offeredon new sales of fund shares, the fund's prospectus and statement of additionalinformation would have to be amended in accordance with rule 22d-1(c).<ITAG tagnum="81">9. No-Load Labeling</ITAG>Paragraph (b) of the proposed rule would remove the exemption for any fundthat charges a deferred sales load and holds itself out to the public asa ``no-load'' fund or uses terminology that, given the context and presentation,is likely to convey to investors the impression that the fund does notimpose any charges for sales or promotional expenses. Similarly, if theproscribed activity was engaged in by any other person that would otherwisereceive an exemption under the proposed rule, any affiliated person ofthat person, or any affiliated person of such affiliated person, the exemptionwould be unavailable to the person who engaged in such activity. Removalof the exemption would also pertain to any person relying on the exemptionwho causes the proscribed action to be taken.The Commission previously has taken the position that it would be inappropriateand misleading for a fund that imposes a deferred sales load to be heldout as a ``no-load'' fund.58<NOTE/> Paragraph (b), therefore, would codify an existing Commissionposition. Further, even if funds that impose a deferred sales load areprohibited from being held out as ``no-load,'' shareholders still couldbe misled by the use of language which simply avoids using the term ``load.''For instance, phrases such as ``no front-end sales charge,'' or ``no initialsales charge,'' without appropriate qualifying language, may convey tothe prospective shareholder the same impression as the ``no-load'' label.Subtle distinctions between the term ``load'' and its descriptive substitutesmight not be easily recognized by investors. Therefore, to avoid investorconfusion, paragraph (b) of the proposed rule also would prohibit the useof terminology that, given the context and presentation, is likely to conveyto investors the impression that no charges for sales or promotional expensesare imposed on fund shares.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>58 <T3>See </T3>Release No. 13048, <T3>supra </T3>note 13, at n. 6.<ITAG tagnum="81">10. </ITAG>Application to Series CompaniesParagraph (c)(1) of the proposed rule would provide that, for purposesof the rule, a registered open-end management investment company includesa separate series of such a company. Proposed paragraph (c)(1) would, therefore,require a fund to calculate any deferred sales load payable by consideringonly an investor's account in the particular series from which the sharesare being redeemed. Funds would be prohibited from calculating the deferredsales load payable by aggregating all of an investor's accounts in a fund,regardless of the particular series from which the shares are being redeemed.Virtually all Applicants have represented that the CDSL will be imposedon a series-by-series basis.59<NOTE/> Accordingly, proposed paragraph (c)(1) would codify ths practiceand apply it to the other types of deferred sales loads permissible underthe proposed rule.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>59 The Commission has issued at least one exemptive orderto an Applicant that represented that the CDSL payable would be the <T3>lesser </T3>of (i) the amount calculated based on the aggregate ofthe shareholder's accounts in the fund, with the result that aggregatepurchase payments and current account value would be determined withoutregard to the particular series in which purchase payments were allocatedor from which the redemption is made, or (ii) the amount calculated basedonly on the current value and aggregate purchase payments of the particularseries from which the shares are being redeemed. <T3>See </T3>E.F. Hutton Investment Series, Inc., Investment Company ActRel. Nos. 12079 (Dec. 4, 1981) [46 FR 60703, Dec. 11, 1981] (notice ofapplication) and 12135 (Jan. 4, 1982) (order). However, this order wassubsequently amended to require the calculation of the CDSL only on a series-by-seriesbasis. <T3>See </T3>Investment Company Act Rel. Nos. 16426 (June 8, 1988) [53FR 22255, June 14, 1988] (notice of application) and 16464 (July 1, 1988)(order).This aspect of the proposed rule reflects the Commission's view that itis appropriate in the deferred sales load context to treat each individualseries of a series fund as a separate fund.\60\<NOTE/> The individual series of a series fund are, as a practicalmatter, separate investment companies. Separate series of a single fundtypically have very different investment objectives and shareholders ofan individual series hold interests only in that series' segregated portfolio.Because both the objectives and the portfolios of two series in one fundmay be vastly different, the best interest of the shareholders of one seriesmay or may not coincide with the best interests of the shareholders ofanother series. Accordingly, the nature of series companies justifies treatingindividual series as separate funds under the proposed rule. This wouldpermit each individual series to structure deferred sales loads in themanner best suited to the needs of that series and its shareholders. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\60\ The Commission has treated the separate series of a seriesfund as separate investment companies for purposes of applying other rulesunder the Act. For example, rule 17a-7 [17 CFR 270.17a-7], which exemptsfrom section 17(a) of the Act the purchase or sale of certain securitiesbetween a registered investment company and certain affiliated persons,treats the separate series of a single investment company as separate investmentcompanies. <T3>See </T3>Investment Company Act Rel. No. 11676 (Mar. 10, 1981) [45FR 17011, Mar. 17, 1981] (adopting rule 17a-7 under the Act). In addition,rule 12d3-1 [17 CFR 270.12d3-1] which, under certain conditions, permitsregistered investment companies to acquire securities issued by personsengaged directly or indirectly in securities-related businesses, providesthat an individual series shall be treated as if it is a separate investmentcompany. <T3>See </T3>Investment Company Act Rel. No. 14036 (July 13, 1984) [49FR 29362, July 20, 1984] (adopting rule 12d3-1 under the Act). <T3>See also </T3>Release 16431, <T3>supra </T3>note 4 (proposing amendments to rule 12b-1). The Commission also is concerned that the possible complexity of calculatinga deferred sales load on a fund-wide basis without regard to the particularseries from which the shares are being redeemed could cause investor confusionand difficulty in computing the deferred sales load. In addition, an investorcould be required to pay a higher deferred sales load than the investorwould have to pay if the deferred sales load was calculated on the basisof only the series from which the shares were being redeemed. The Commissionis aware however, that, in some instances, calculating a deferred salesload on a fund-wide basis may result in a lower deferred sales load. Accordingly,comment is specifically requested on whether and under what circumstancesa fund-wide calculation should be permitted. B. Proposed Amendments to Form N-1A The Commission recently amended form N-1A to require all fund expenses,including deferred sales loads, to be disclosed in a table located nearthe front of the propspectus (``fee table''). \61\<NOTE/> The Commission proposes to modify the table to accommodatethe deferred sales loads that would be permitted if rule 6c-10 is adopted.In the revised fee table, the fund would be required to list the maximumamount of deferred load as a percentage of the net asset value at the timeof purchase and, where applicable, as a percentage of the net asset valueat the time of redemption. \62\<NOTE/> Consistent with the approach taken currently in form N-1A,the range of CDSLs over time may be disclosed in the fee table. As is thecase with respect to front-end sales loads, however, other scheduled variationsin deferred loads would not be listed in the fee table. \63\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\61\ Investment Company Act Rel. No. 16244 (Feb. 1, 1988)[53 FR 3192, Feb. 4, 1988] (``Release 16244''). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\62\ Currently, the table requires that a deferred load belisted as ``a percentage of original purchase price or redemption proceeds,as applicable.'' <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\63\ <T3>See </T3>Release 16244, <T3>supra </T3>note 61, at Section A.2. Funds that permit deduction of a sales load in installments would listthe maximum amount as a ``deferred load'' and may describe the amount andfrequency of installments after the caption ``Deferred Sales Load.'' \64\<NOTE/> If the installment amounts or frequency of deduction varyso that a brief description after the caption is not practical, a fundmay include a table of installment amounts within the larger fee table,unless the table would be so lengthy as to diminish the utility of thetable as a device for easily comparing fund expenses. In that case, thetable would direct that only the maximum amount of deferred load be listedin the table and a cross-reference provided to the textual discussion ofsales load in the prospectus. \65\<NOTE/> Comment is requested as to whether this approach would providefor adequate disclosure of deferred sales loads permitted under proposedrule 6c-10. In addition, comment is requested as to whether multiple feetables should be allowed in situations that involve unusual complexity.\66\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\64\ <T3>See </T3>proposed Instruction 5 to Item 2(a)(i) of form N-1A. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\65\ <T3>Cf. </T3>Instruction 7 to Item 2(a)(i) of form N-1A, and proposed Instructions10 and 11 to forms N-3 and N-4 in Investment Company Act Rel. No. 16482(June 1, 1988) [53 FR 27872, July 25, 1988] (``Release 16482'') <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\66\ In Release 16482, <T3>supra </T3>note 65, the Commission published a staff guideline forthe computation of amounts required to be listed under the Example portionof the fee table in variable annuity separate account prospectuses. A similarguide is under consideration for form N-1A and would be modified, if necessary,to accommodate sales loads deducted from shareholder accounts in installments.Comments is requested as to what modifications, if any, would be needed.C. Request for Comment on Rules 6c-8, 6e-2 and 6e-3 (T) The imposition of sales loads on a deferred basis originated with separateaccounts and is now a common practice in the insurance products area. Separateaccounts should be subject to the same procedural requirements as mutualfunds, absent a compelling need under the Act for special regulations arisingfrom the nature of that insurance product.\67\<NOTE/> The rules and proposed rule amendments governing the impositionof deferred sales loads by separate accounts do not presently include manyof the conditions set forth in proposed rule 6c-10. In order to promotecompetitive equality among investment company products and enable separateaccount investors to receive benefits and protections comparable to thosethat would be available to mutual fund investors under proposed rule 6c-10,the Commission is considering whether to propose amendments to rule 6c-8and 6e-3 (T), and issue revised proposed amendments to rule 6e-2, to requireany separate account that wishes to impose a deferred sales load in relianceon those rules to comply with conditions similar to those contained inproposed rule 6c-10. the Commission therefore is requesting comment oninsurance considerations relevant to amendments of these rules.\68\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\67\ <T3>See </T3>Investment Company Act Rel. No. 15586 (Feb. 26, 1987) [52FR 7166, 7170, Mar. 9, 1987] (reproposing rule 26a-3 under the Act). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\68\ Not all of the proposed conditions in rule 6c-10 wouldbe relevant in the context of separate accounts. For instance, paragraph(a)(2) of proposed rule 6c-10, which would prohibit the imposition of adeferred sales load that, alone or in combination with a front-end salesload, would exceed the maximum charge permissible under the NASD Rules,would not be applicable to separate accounts. Rules 6c-8 and 6e-3(T), andthe proposed amendments to rule 6e-2, already prohibit the total maximumsales load imposed on a contract, including any deferred sales load, fromexceeding 9 percent of purchase payments. The Commission limited the totalamount of sales loads (including deferred sales loads) charged by separateaccounts to 9 percent of purchase payments, because such accounts are subjectto section 27(a)(1) of the Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-27(a)(1)]. Section 27(a)(1)prohibits a registered investment company issuing periodic payment plancertificates from charging a sales load that exceeds 9 percent of purchasepayments.<ITAG tagnum="84">Cost Benefit of Proposed Action</ITAG>Proposed rule 6c-10 would not impose any significant burdens on mutualfunds. It would benefit mutual funds by reducing the costs that they wouldincur by virtually eliminating the need to file exemptive applicationsin this area. The proposed rule also would benefit mutual funds by givingthem broader flexibility in the structuring of sales load arrangements.Additionally, the Commission would benefit because its staff would haveto review very few applications for exemptive relief in this area. Commentsare requested, however, on these matters and on the costs or benefits ofany other aspect of the proposed action. Commenters should submit estimatesof any costs and benefits perceived, together with any supporting empiricalevidence available.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ITAG>The Commission has prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysisin accordance with 5 U.S.C. 603 regarding proposed rule 6c-10 and the proposedamendments to form N-1A. The Analysis explains that proposed rule 6c-10would permit mutual funds to impose sales loads on a deferred basis. Itstates that the proposed rule would give mutual funds broader flexibilityin the structuring of sales load arrangements. The proposed rule couldalso reduce significantly the number of exemptive applications filed withthe Commission in this area, and, therefore, reduce the costs incurredby smaller entities in preparing and filing exemptive applications. TheAnalysis also states that, to the extent funds would be required to maintainrecords to track and assess deferred sales loads, such recordkeeping iscomparable to that currently practiced by funds with exemptive orders.The proposed amendments to form N-1A would modify that form to accommodatethe deferred sales loads that would be permitted if rule 6c-10 is adopted.A copy of the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis may be obtained bycontacting Rochelle G.
