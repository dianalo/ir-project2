Sofar, the system can only handle somewhat constrained environments: tall,rectangular, darker colored obstacles with well lighted, ligher coloredwalls forming the background. The intent was to demonstrate how a simplesensor fusion system can lead to great improvements in robot perception.The program is executed much more quickly than other more sophisticated3D vision techniques. It is more reliable than if just one type of sensorwas used. In addition, the robot, HERMIES-II, is capable of accuratelymaintaining its position and orientation in the navigation area. Thenavigation program is relatively inexpensive to implement, and is goaloriented. It allows relatively optimum paths to be found in a previouslyunexplored, potentially dynamic environment. 9 refs., 6 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
