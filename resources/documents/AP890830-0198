The story followed the rape of her character, fashion modelCricket Blair, by her boyfriend played by Ken Olandt, and hissubsequent trial.   ``We've just finished the trial and the jury was about to turnhim loose when my brother found another girl he had raped on acollege campus,'' said Bell, 20. ``The judge allowed us to bring inthe new witness. I just got a script where I tell the collegeofficials that if they'd listened to her I wouldn't have beenraped.''   The trial ended last week with his conviction on a charge of rape.   Bell went to the Los Angeles Commission on Violence Against Womenand treatment centers, where she talked to rape victims andcounselors.   ``This is a good story to do in the summer when a lot of studentsare home,'' said Bell. ``The people I talked to said the incidenceof date rape on college campuses is going up and up. I was just on apersonal appearance in Oklahoma where two women told me they hadfriends who reported rapes after seeing our show.''   She said the boyfriend in the show gave little indication that hewould attack her.   ``He was the handsome All-American boy,'' she said. ``He wasalways looking after me. You'd never suspect. The only sign was thathe was a touchy-feely kind of person.   ``We've stressed that you should learn about a person. And whenyou go on a date set your limits right away. We've tried to make itrealistic so girls will know what to expect if it should happen tothem.''   ``The Young and the Restless,'' the top-rated daytime soap opera,does a major story aimed at young people every summer. In past yearsthey've done stories on alcoholism, teen-age pregnancy and AIDS.   Bell has gone through a lot of trauma in her time on ``The Youngand the Restless.'' Her character's mother has AIDS and earlier thisyear she learned her fiance is actually her brother and his fatheris actually her father.   Bell, whose own father is the boss of the top-rated soap opera,has been with the show full time for the past two years. She madeher first appearance at 9 and at 13 began making regular appearancesas Cricket whenever she had time off from school.   ``The audience liked it because they'd never seen someone soyoung grow up on a show before,'' said Bell. ``I became a teen modelfor the cosmetics company that's the focus of the show. The childrenof viewers could watch me and get tips on makeup. The message wasdon't overdo your makeup, but I didn't buy that myself. I wentthrough the makeup phase, too.''   Her father is William J. Bell, who is executive producer andco-creator with her mother, Lee Phillip Bell. They're also thecreators of CBS's ``The Bold and the Beautiful.'' One brother,Bradley, is a writer for ``The Bold and The Beautiful.'' Anotherbrother, Billy, is in charge of finances for both shows.   Lauralee still lives at home with her parents. In fact, all ofthe family lives in a large compound in the Hollywood Hills. TheBells moved here only a few years ago after writing and producingthe show from Chicago.   ``It was great that my father was the producer. But you have towork twice as hard,'' Lauralee says. ``People expect you to come inand be this obnoxious little thing. I never complained about my workschedule, I never complained about my hair or makeup. I worked hardto prove myself. I don't run to my father and I don't carry tales.My parents never come on the set when I'm working.''</TEXT><TEXT>   Elsewhere in television:   STORYBOOK HOST _ Danny Glover will be the host of the thirdseason of Showtime's ``Storybook Classics,'' which premieresTuesday, Sept. 12.
