The huge high-yield bond issue has been the talk of Wall Streetfor weeks, with market strategists and investors giving it greatimportance because of a recent lapse in the junk bond business andfears of an economic slowdown.   It also throws the spotlight on lead underwriter Drexel BurnhamLambert Inc. as it tackles the record deal without Michael Milken,the junk bond industry's chief architect who is under indictmentand out of commission indefinitely.   ``It's huge,'' said Warren Greene, president of the AmericanInvestors Income Fund Inc. of Greenwich, Conn. ``Four billiondollars is a lot of money to raise in this market.''   The offer by RJR Holdings Capital Corp., which became effectiveFriday, dwarfs other corporate debt issues. BCI Holdings in 1986offered $2.5 billion in non-investment grade bonds and OccidentalPetroleum Corp. the same year offered $2.48 billion ininvestment-grade bonds. No other offering has exceeded $2 billion.   The RJR bonds are part of an $8 billion securities package toraise money for the takeover of Atlanta-based RJR Nabisco byKohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., the investment firm that specializesin buying companies with borrowed money in deals known as leveragedbuyouts.   The bonds have high yields, partly because of fears that thesheer size of the offer would deter investment managers who don'tthink the market can absorb the load. In fact, some majorinstitutions are tiptoeing around the non-investment grade bondsdespite universal acclaim for their quality.   ``When you have such quantities of merchandise thrown on themarket, regardless of how the deep the market is, there is questionabout the appetite of any investor,'' said an executive at a majorcapital management group that is limiting its takings.   Drexel priced some of the securities to yield 15 percent, morethan 1 percentage point above what was initially planned.   The complexity of the deal also could scare off some investors.Underwriters have structured the bond sales in several tiers, withthe same securities having different prices depending on the amountpurchased. Also, interest rates on some securities will be reset atcertain dates.   ``It's a complicated transaction,'' said Gloria Vila, a senioranalyst with Moody's Investors Service Inc., a credit ratingagency. ``That's caused some difficulty with buyers.''   There also is some skepticism about Drexel's ability to managethe deal without Milken, who took a leave of absence after pleadinginnocent to 98 counts of racketeering and securities fraud in March.   Milken was working during Drexel's sale of $5 billion inshort-term RJR notes earlier this year, which was smoother than thecompany's attempt to drum up support of institutional investors forthe current offer.   ``The absence of Milken is apparent in the delays and thedifficulties as have been perceived in the marketplace,'' thecapital management executive said.   But he added: ``They still have managed to do it. That's acredit to Drexel's firepower.''   The issue lifts Drexel back to the top of the junk bond market,with 50.2 percent of the $10.96 billion in bonds issued this year,its highest share since 1985 when it cornered 54.9 percent,according to Securities Data Co.   Drexel had stumbled to a 15.9 percent first-quarter share, whichanalysts had attributed to the loss of Milken and the bad publicityover the firm's securities fraud woes.   The total financing for the RJR transaction will approach $20billion, including $4 billion in other securities such as preferredstock issued when the RJR-KKR takeover was completed in April.   The RJR junk bonds are designed to replace the $5 billion inshort-term bridge notes sold earlier this year by Drexel. Somevariations in the sale are designed to induce investors to exchangethe short-term investment for long-term bonds.   Despite its size and complexity, many traders believe the marketcan absorb the RJR issue because of the stability of the companiesunder the food and tobacco giant's umbrella.   ``The credit strength is there,'' said Ted Reed, vice presidentof Aetna Capital Management Inc., which is buying $7 million of thebonds for its $130 million portfolio. ``In a downturn, that creditis going to hold up better than a company that makes widgets tocompete with the Japanese. These are pretty high visibilitybrand-name products.''   ``You have to step back from all the trees and look at theforest and say, `Does RJR have value?' I think the answer is yes,''said Ed D'Alelio, co-chief investment officer for high-yield bondswith the Putnam Cos., a financial services firm in Boston.   Analysts believe the RJR sale will be a benchmark for the $180billion a year junk bond market, which has been in a tailspinbecause of recession talk and a Harvard University report that junkbonds may have a higher default rate than previously believed.   ``I always think the more liquidity we have in the market thebetter we are,'' said John Moran, a junk bond trader with AdvestInc. ``I think it's much easier when you have a visible name likethis rather than a company nobody's ever heard of.''</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Monday, May 15</NOTE></DOC>
