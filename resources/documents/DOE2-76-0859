<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-76-0859 </DOCNO><TEXT>Conformal field theories on Riemann surfaces are considered and the resultis applied to study the loop amplitudes for bosonic strings. It is shownthat there is a close resemblance between the loop amplitudes for phi/sup3/-theory and the expressions for string multi-loop amplitudes. The similaritybetween phi/sup 3/-amplitudes in curved backgrounds and the analyticstructure of string amplitudes in backgrounds described by conformalfield theories is also pointed out. 60 refs.; 5 figs.; 200 schemes.</TEXT></DOC>
