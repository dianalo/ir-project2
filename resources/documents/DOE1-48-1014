An equivalent hadron model is developed,displaying an effective hadron-hadron interaction which is strongly repulsive.We compare the effective hadron model results with the exact quark modelobservables in the kinematic region of large momentum transfer, smallenergy transfer. The nucleon response function in this y-scaling regionis, within the traditional framework, sensitive to the nucleon momentumdistribution at large momentum. We find a surprisingly small effect ofhadron substructure. Furthermore, we find in our model that a simpleparametrization of modified hadron size in the bound state, motivatedby the bound quark momentum distribution, is not a useful way to correlatedifferent observables.</TEXT></DOC>
