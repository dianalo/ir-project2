She slashed his theories toshreds,'' Shust recalled. ``There was no way he could counter.There was the expert sitting in front of him.''   The perfect victim _ someone who is genuine, articulate andsympathetic _ often surfaces in a newspaper story, a letter to alawmaker or a list kept by an advocacy group.   Signs, who organized the Senate abortion-rights hearing, saidall the witnesses who told personal stories had already done so atleast once before in a public forum. She said it is hard to findwomen willing to talk about long-ago abortions.   ``They were not legal and were done under secretive conditions.There may be members of their family who don't know about it,''Signs said.   Most advocacy groups can readily point congressional aidestoward people who have experienced the problem they want toilluminate. And some go even further. The Maryland Food Committeeof Baltimore has developed a ``talent pool'' of sorts _ a stable ofeloquent poor people regularly dispatched to press conferences,meetings and hearings.   Coleman said the Baltimore group came up with six or sevenpossible witnesses for the Senate hunger hearing in February. Thetwo chosen were Adams, a white woman with nine children, and MaryTamper, a black woman with two children.   Adams said her family lost its income when she separated fromher husband, who made $55,000 a year as an engineer. He was jailedon child abuse charges. Tamper's husband, whose annual salary was$30,000, died of leukemia. She said she had to give up herteacher's aide job and move the family in with her mother.   Coleman said the two women, forced to rely on a variety offederal programs to feed their kids, were picked with an eye towardbreaking stereotypes.   ``Both had been middle class,'' he said. ``We felt that was astrong message. There are so many myths about who poor people are _minorities with lots and lots of kids, on welfare and food stampsfor years. We felt it was important not to perpetuate those myths.''   From Coleman's viewpoint, the hearing was a success. He said itsmajor recommendations _ to expand food stamps and a nutritionprogram for mothers and children _ won the support of both chairmanJim Sasser, D-Tenn., and Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., the senior GOPmember of the panel. The extra money may be added to the 1990 farmbill.   Lichtman said victim witnesses also helped secure passage of a1988 fair housing law.   When women described being denied housing because they had kids,``that helped make the case about why we needed to prohibitdiscrimination against families with children,'' said Lichtman.   She said the same dynamics were at work when the Voting RightsAct was extended in 1982. ``People were brought in from Alabama andGeorgia and talked about what it was like to be disenfranchised ornever enfranchised,'' Lichtman said. ``That helped get the lawreauthorized.''   Lawmakers sympathized with witnesses who said they'd been firedfor taking a couple of weeks off while their children werehospitalized or dying, and that may be part of the reason the Houserecently passed a job-leave bill. But the bill is facing toughopposition in the Senate and at the White House.   Parents who testified about the shortcomings of day care alsomade an impression, but a compromise child-care bill now in theworks probably won't resolve all of the problems they raisedregarding quality, price and availability.   And foster children continue to suffer neglect and abuse despitea little boy's poignant testimony in 1987.   Marcia Lowry, the ACLU attorney who accompanied the boy to thathearing, said at the time that agencies were not meeting federalrequirements to monitor foster kids, find permanent homes for themor provide services to preserve their families. She also alleged analmost complete lack of federal supervision.   What has happened since then?   ``Things have gotten worse,'' said Lowry, director of the ACLU'sChildren's Rights Project.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, July 1</NOTE></DOC>
