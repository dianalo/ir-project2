Members voted against admitting women and for doing away withthe Elk's ``blackball rule'' at a closed business meeting Thursdayon the final day of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks125th annual convention.   Repeal of the blackball rule was approved at the urging of theElks Lodge at Lompoc, Calif. Two black applicants there wereblackballed recently, and as a result the California AttorneyGeneral's Office is investigating possible civil rights violations.   The old policy allowed any three members of an Elks lodge toreject, or ``blackball'' a prospective member. Some said that madeit difficult for blacks to join the Elks.   Under the new policy, a two-thirds majority of a lodge'smembership could approve a new member.   ``I think it was a step forward. It was a rule that has causedproblems for a number of lodges. I think everyone felt it was timeto change,'' said William Wodarczak, the exalted ruler of the1,800-member Santa Barbara lodge.   In Lompoc, about 35 miles northwest of Santa Barbara, two blackmen whose membership bids were rejected said they planned toreapply.   ``I'm elated at the outcome,'' said Ernie Hutchinson, 57, alocal housing official. ``I'm proud of the lodge here because theyspearheaded this thing.''   Hutchinson said he plans to reapply immediately. Should he beaccepted, ``I don't think there will be a strain. I am not going inwith any animosity.''   Joe Martin, 56, also said he was pleased by the vote.   ``I am a bit surprised, though, but it restores my faith inAmerica,'' said Martin, a real estate agent.   While the Elks do have some black members nationally, severalCalifornia lodges threatened legal action if rules were not changedto allow more minority representation in the group's 2,300 lodges.   Members also voted overwhelmingly against the resolution toadmit women, said Donald D. Dapelo, the newly installed grandexalted ruler.   Sexism was not behind the rejection of female membership, Dapelosaid.   ``I think perhaps it could also be considered that the Elks areinterested in protecting the rights of women to have their ownorganization just like we have,'' Dapelo said. ``And there aretwice as many of those, so I am told.''   Elks boast a nationwide membership of roughly 1.5 million, butmembership has been declining and those who wanted to admit womensaid that might remedy the problem.   Dapelo disagreed.   ``It's a fact that we don't see too many of our members standingin line to join those ladies' organizations either.''   An estimated 12,000 people attended the convention.</TEXT></DOC>
