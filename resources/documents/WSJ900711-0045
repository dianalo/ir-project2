Throughout the seven-week trial, the government didn'tproduce a single customer to testify that he had been rippedoff by exchange insiders. There were no grandmothers who hadlost their savings, no banks that had been bilked. &quot;Noultimate alleged victim was called to testify; that's veryunusual,&quot; says Robert Tarun, a former assistant U.S.attorney.</LP><TEXT>   Defense attorneys were able to emphasize that no customersor brokerage firms ever complained about the trades thatformed the basis for the alleged fraud.   That and other weaknesses in the government's case led ajury on Monday to set back the most ambitious investigationever of alleged corruption at Chicago's two big futuresexchanges. In essence, the jury found two traders in theChicago Mercantile Exchange's Swiss Franc pit guilty of eightcounts of stealing only $200 from customers. On the remainderof the more than 100 counts, the jury either found the twotraders and a co-defendant innocent or couldn't reach averdict.   The jury was deadlocked on a conspiracy count against onetrader, Robert Mosky, under the Racketeer Influenced andCorrupt Organizations Act. (The two other traders, David Zatzand Danny Scheck, were charged with lesser violations ofcommodity law.) In interviews, several jurors said asignificant number of their peers refused to consider theconspiracy portion of the government's case, believing theprosecutors hadn't come close to proving it.   Juror Terry Elkins, a 44-year-old plant engineer, said heeven believed a government agent had tried to lure tradersinto breaking the law. Juror Jill Schleff, a former teacher,said the lack of evidence that any major wrongdoing occurredleft her wondering as she went into the jury room, &quot;Why werethey even arrested?&quot;   The outcome of the trial, the result of an elaborate andexpensive undercover investigation dubbed &quot;OperationHedgeclipper&quot; at the Chicago Merc and &quot;Operation Sourmash&quot; atthe Chicago Board of Trade, threatens to cripple theprosecution's ongoing investigation. So far, 48 individualshave been indicted as a result of the investigation. Sixteenof those indicted have pleaded guilty to fraud charges andare cooperating with the government.   Prosecutors had hoped to tap into a public backlashagainst 1980s-style greed. Prosecutors had hoped that, astraders turned into witnesses, convictions would top 100 andperhaps reach beyond the trading floor to clearing firmofficials.   Though the government lacked a target on the order of IvanBoesky, some Justice Department officials hoped the futurescase would rival Wall Street's insider-trading investigation.But the small-change nature of some of the Swiss-franc pitcharges proved to be a far cry from the suitcase full ofmoney and illegal million-dollar trades the Wall Street probeexposed.   Allowing the Swiss franc trial to be the leadoff courtcase to develop out of the investigation also appears to havebeen a blunder. The Swiss franc pit trial &quot;was the defense'sbest case. The government's case was highly technical,&quot; adefense attorney said. Assistant U.S. Attorney DanielGillogly conceded as much at one point in the trial. &quot;There'sno sex, drugs and rock `n' roll here, this is a thinkingman's case,&quot; he said.   Government attorneys cited scheduling conflicts betweendefense lawyers and federal judges for the Swiss franc casegoing to trial first. But prosecutors could have delayedasking a grand jury to indict the Swiss franc traders. Trialsof traders who worked in the Japanese yen pit at the ChicagoMerc and the soybean pit at the CBOT are set to begin inSeptember.   None of the cases the government plans to bring involvehuge amounts of money, but the counts listed in the SwissFranc case involved less than the rest. The dollar amountallegedly stolen from customers in many of the trades was aslittle as $12.50 a futures contract -- the minimum priceincrement, or tick, by which foreign currency futures tradeon the Merc. Four of the trades that underlie the fraudcharges against Mr. Zatz resulted in profits to the trader of$50 or less a trade.   This represented a minuscule portion of the tradesconducted in the pit. Mr. Mosky, for instance, was indictedon less than 0.1% of the trades he made in 1988.   The cornerstone of the prosecution's case was a series ofmore than 100 secret tape-recordings that undercover FBIagent Randall Jannett made while posing as a futures traderfrom February through December of 1988. Yet no single tapewas a &quot;smoking gun&quot; that clearly illustrated fraudulenttrades.   Nearly all the tapes concerning the three defendantsconsisted of arcane and often confusing bantering amongtraders about price quotes and the number of futurescontracts each had to buy or sell. Mr. Jannett interpretedthe trading tapes from the witness stand for 15 days, oftencomparing them in mind-numbing detail to reams of exchangetrading data and brokerage firm records. One result of thehours of testimony delivered in a &quot;just the facts&quot;policeman's monotone was that some jurors fell asleep duringthe trial.   While listening to the tapes the jurors also had to jugglethe government's transcript and another, covering certaintapes, compiled by Mr. Scheck's attorney, Harvey Silets. Thedefense transcript provided different interpretations andattributions for several conversations.   The government's intent in interpreting each tape was toillustrate that the trades were made non-competitively. Thegovernment alleged that the traders acted as part of aconspiracy to skim customer profits. The most common fraudalleged occurred when Mr. Mosky, the broker handling customerorders, got &quot;local&quot; traders trading just for themselves toaccept losing trades to cover errors Mr. Mosky made inexecuting customers' orders. Mr. Mosky then allegedly repaidthe locals with non-competitive trades that the locals couldimmediately convert into a profit in the market, pocketinggains that rightly belonged to Mr. Mosky's customers. Mr.Scheck and Mr. Zatz, both local traders, participated in thescheme, prosecutors said.   But defense attorneys aggressively cross-examined theagent, maintaining that most tapes represented two tradersconfirming earlier trades that theagent-turned-neophyte-trader had failed to notice. They saidhe was too inexperienced to understand or see what washappening in the pit on many occasions.   &quot;Jannett's position was if he didn't see it, it didn'thappen,&quot; said Mr. Silets, Mr. Scheck's attorney. In hisclosing arguments, Mr. Silets asked: &quot;What did Jannett have,some sort of force field out of Star Trek around him?&quot;   The attorney got Mr. Jannett to concede that a trade hesaid he observed as being below the market price, andtherefore non-competitive, could have happened 20 secondsearlier than the time he recorded the event in his hiddenmicrophone. If it had occured 20 seconds earlier it wouldhave been executed at what was then the market price.   In addition to checking trades, many of the fraud countsagainst Mr. Mosky were the result of honest mistakes he madewhile trying to get all his customer orders executed underchaotic market conditions, said Elliot Samuels, Mr. Mosky'sattorney. Error rates of 10% or more aren't considered out ofthe ordinary for busy Merc brokers, he said.   &quot;This is life in the pits. It's not pleasant, it's notserene, it's not pretty, but things get done,&quot; Mr. Samuelstold the jury.   Prosecutors attacked what they called the Wizard of Ozdefense, which painted a picture of pit trading as toocomplex for &quot;mere mortals,&quot; such as jurors or FBI agents, tounderstand. The government agent &quot;pulled back the curtain&quot;and disclosed the corruption in the Swiss franc pit, just asa Great Plains flimflam artist was disclosed as the true Oz,said James Fleissner, an assistant U.S. attorney.   The government says its inclination is to retry the threetraders on the 86 counts on which the jury was deadlocked.   ---   Scott Kilman and Jeff Bailey contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
