The observed annealingcharacteristics can be best described by a two term exponential functionp(t) = p/sub 1/exp(-{alpha}/sub 1/t)+p/sub 2/exp(-{alpha}/sub 2/t) withan Arrhenius type temperature dependence of the annealing coefficients{alpha}/sub i/, {alpha}/sub i/ = {alpha}/sub 0,i/exp(-E/sub A,i//kT).The activation energies obtained are E/sub A,1/ = (0.94+-0.16) eV andE/sub A,2/ = (1.04+-0.15) eV. The possible annealing mechanisms are discussedand comparison with results in other glasses is given.</TEXT></DOC>
