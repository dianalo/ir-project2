<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-35-0784 </DOCNO><TEXT>The uses of ionizing radiation in medicine are currently undergoing changesdue to at least four major influences: (1) the constantly changing publicperception of the hazards of radiation, (2) continuing technical innovationand development in equipment, (3) the imposition of diagnosis-relatedgroup funding by government health-care funding agencies, and (4) anincrease in the average age of the U.S. population. The combined effectof these influences will probably result in a major increase in biplanarfluoroscopic examinations to support nonsurgical approaches such as percutaneoustransluminal coronary angioplasty, percutaneous transluminal neuroembolism,and lithotripsy (the fracturing of kidney stones). As some of these examinationscan result in 1.5 h of fluoroscopy, major doses to the patient and tothe clinical staff can be expected. In addition, improved diagnostictechniques, such as using positron emission tomography (a combinationof biochemistry and positron-emitting isotopes), can be expected to increasethe number of small cyclotrons installed in medical centers. Counteractingthese increases in radiation exposure is the development of digital radiography,which generally results in a lowering of the dose per diagnostic procedure.In the realm of therapeutic uses, one can expect higher-energy treatmentaccelerators, more patients being released from the hospital on therapeuticdoses of isotopes, and a potential acceptance of neutron therapy as acancer treatment modality. The latter treatment may take the form ofboron capture therapy, 252Cf implant therapy, or external beam therapyusing high-energy cyclotrons and the p,Be or the d,Be reaction to createthe neutrons.</TEXT></DOC>
