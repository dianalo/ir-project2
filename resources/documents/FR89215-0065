(a) In <T3>1989 </T3>the storage component is proposed to commence. Penn-Yorkwould start receiving gas for injection by April 1989, with withdrawalsto start by November 1989. (b) in <T3>1990 </T3>the first increment of Canadian gas transportation servicefrom the Niagara import point is proposed to commence. Specifically, Nationalproposes to transport up to 85,000 Mcf/d to Leidy, along with 34,000 Mcf/dto delivery points on the Niagara Spur Loop Line. National states thatit must have 6,300 horse power at its new concord compressor station inservice, as well as the pipe and compression facilities at the Ellisburgconnecting the National and CNG stations with the 41 mile Ellisburg toLeidy Line. The Niagara Spur Loop Line is proposed to be in service byNovember 1990. (c) In <T3>1991 </T3>the remaining 40,000 Mcf/d of the Canadian gas transportationservice from the Niagara import point is proposed to commence. Nationalstates that it requires the remaining 2,300 horsepower at the Concord compressorstation to be in service at that time. (4) <T3>Revised Rates: </T3>(a) Adjust transportation rates to reflect changed facilities, joint ownershipand usage of the Niagara Spur Loop Line and the Ellisburg to Leidy Line,changed volumes, and current precedent for setting National's rates; and(b) levelize transportation rates to account for phase in of facilitiesconstruction, in-service dates, and volumes. (5) <T3>Markets: </T3>(a) According to National, the market for the Transco System ExpansionProject has been refined over the last year. The Niagara Settlement notedthat original nominations exceeded the proposed levels of service, thatTranscontinental Pipeline Company (Transco) had requested further datato ascertain <T3>bona fide </T3>markets, and that the results of this review would appearin Transco's amended application. In its companion amended application,Transco is submitting final exclusive contractual arrangements for boththe transportation and storage services, and is seeking to demonstratethat the full 11 Bcf of storage and 100,000 Mcf/d of related transportationservice is subscribed, as is the Canadian gas transportation service of125,000 Mcf/d. (b) As noted in the Niagara Settlement, National is also amending its applicationto reflect the transportation and purchase of an additional 34,000 Mcf/dthrough its capacity on the Niagara Spur Loop Line; specifically the purchaseof 10,000 Mcf/d for National's own system supply and transportation of24,000 Mcf/d for a cogeneration shipper for two facilities in New YorkState. (6) <T3>Environment: </T3>According to National, the unchanged portions of the application are ripefor environmental review. In addition National has submitted with the amendedapplication, as exhibit Z-3, a separate document containing the twelverevised resource reports on the changed facilities proposed herein: (1)shift of the East Eden compressor station to Concord, New York; (2) 2.5miles of 24andmin16; line from National's to CNG's compressor station atEllisburg Pennsylvania; and (3) 2,600 horsepower of compression at National'sEllisburg station. National has also submitted topographical maps and aerialsof these facilities. (7) <T3>Storage Abandonment: </T3>National is amending the application to delete Penn Fuel Gas, at its request,from Penn-York's abandonment application (by which a portion of Penn-York'sstorage capacity was to be made available for the project), and to increaseby the same amount capacity that it will provide to Penn-York to serveTransco and its customers with the originally requested 11 Bcf of annualstorage service. (8) <T3>Phased Procedural Schedule: </T3>National is requesting that the Commission <T3>phase </T3>review this, and related applications along with the issuanceof the requested certificates to (i) Assure expedited authorization of those facilities needed for 1989service (Phase 1), (ii) Permit sufficient time for Commission review of the Niagara Spur LoopLine and other facilities proposed in this, and other facilities proposedin this, and related, amended applications needed for 1990 and 1991 services(Phase 2), and (iii) Provide for prompt Phase 2 certification as soon after Phae 1 aspossible to meet the timing requirements of the several sponsors of theNiagara import point projects. <T3>Comment date: </T3>February 27, 1989, in accordance with Standard ParagraphF at the end of this notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">25.
