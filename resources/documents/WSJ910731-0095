Benjamin Hooks has said his group would havepreferred another Thurgood Marshall. The NAACP should knowthat when it comes to the Supreme Court's most importantcivil-rights case, Clarence Thomas is another ThurgoodMarshall.   With all the smoke cooked up by Judge Thomas's critics, noone seems to have noticed that he takes precisely the samebroad view of the constitutional promise of equality that Mr.Marshall as the lawyer arguing Brown v. Board of Educationtried -- unsuccessfully -- to persuade the Supreme Court toadopt.</LP><TEXT>   The 1954 case was a great victory for the civil-rightsmovement and especially for the NAACP where Mr. Marshallworked. The justices finally declared that separate but equalfacilities were unconstitutional. A filibuster in the Senateperpetuated Jim Crow segregation, so it was appropriate thatthe court struck down these racist laws.   The problem is that Brown is a classic example of acorrect result reached by lousy reasoning. The opinion byChief Justice Earl Warren was based almost entirely ondubious sociological data on how much better black studentssupposedly learn when they study in the same classrooms aswhites. A famous footnote cites behavior studies inpublications such as the International Journal of Opinion andAttitude Research. It's now clear that this case was thebeginning of an era of judicial activism that substitutedshadows, penumbras and judicial social engineering foradherence to constitutional text and original intent.   There are nearly identical arguments about what the Brownopinion should have said in Mr. Marshall's legal briefs inthe case and Judge Thomas's recent speeches and law-reviewarticles. They agreed that the court should have based itsdecision on legal and constitutional sources, notsociologists. They both referred to the Declaration ofIndependence's self-evident truth that &quot;all men are createdequal,&quot; which finally applied to blacks after the Civil Warthrough the Fourteenth Amendment.   Mr. Marshall's brief and Judge Thomas's writings bothcited Justice Harlan's dissent from the 1896 case thatestablished the doctrine of separate but equal, Plessy v.Ferguson. Justice Harlan would instead have given theFourteenth Amendment its commonsense reading, which is thatit was intended to replace slavery with equality byforbidding the government from treating people differently byrace. The amendment promised blacks all the privileges andimmunities of citizenship and equal protection of the laws.   Judge Thomas wrote that if the opinion in Brown hadadopted this broader view of the Fourteenth Amendment,separate but equal could have been invalidated without citing&quot;Kenneth Clark's controversial doll studies, which could justas easily have been used in support of segregation as againstit.&quot;   The court missed the forest for the trees. &quot;The Brownfocus on environment overlooks the real problem withsegregation, its origin in slavery, which was at fundamentalodds with the founding principles. Had Brown done so, itwould have been forced to talk about slavery, which it nevermentions,&quot; Judge Thomas wrote. He said that a betterunderstanding of the &quot;first principles of equality andliberty&quot; would &quot;lead us above petty squabbling over `quotas,'`affirmative action' and race-conscious remedies of socialills.&quot;   Once on the Supreme Court, Mr. Marshall supported quotas,but he made some of the same points about a colorblindConstitution in his brief in Brown. &quot;The roots of ourAmerican egalitarian ideal extend deep into the history ofthe Western world,&quot; the brief said. &quot;Philosophers of theseventeenth and eighteenth centuries produced an intellectualclimate in which the equality of man was a central concept.Their beliefs rested upon the basic proposition that all manare endowed with certain natural rights.&quot;   Mr. Marshall's reference to natural rights is importantbecause Judge Thomas's critics accuse him of weirdness forusing similar terms. For different reasons, it's importantreassurance for both liberals and conservatives to understandwhy Judge Thomas wrote about natural rights. The reason washis search as head of the Equal Employment OpportunityCommission for a more enduring guarantee of equality than thefleeting legal standards in Brown.   Liberals should know that Judge Thomas is not on a goosechase for penumbras or emanations from the Constitution intowhich he can insert his conservative policy preferences-asJustice Marshall too often did to enact his liberal views.Conservatives should know that he invokes natural rights inthe service of original-intent jurisprudence. His law reviewarticle, &quot;Toward a `Plain Reading' of the Constitution -- TheDeclaration of Independence in ConstitutionalInterpretation,&quot; stressed that terms must be read accordingto their original meaning. Individual liberty isconstitutionally protected, but group rights are not;discrimination must be punished, but not by mandating quotas.   The NAACP's Mr. Hooks recently noted this distinction.Judge Thomas is &quot;not without some good points,&quot; he said,adding that &quot;if a black or a woman has been individuallydiscriminated against or mistreated he'll go to the ends ofthe earth to correct it.&quot;   Now it turns out there's not much difference betweenJustice Marshall and Judge Thomas on the broadest issues ofcivil rights. It will be fascinating to see if the NAACP hasthe courage to abandon its usual liberal allies who hope todo to Judge Thomas what they did to Robert Bork.</TEXT></DOC>
