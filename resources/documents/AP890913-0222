(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Dogs whose owners smoke are at a 50percent greater risk of getting lung cancer, a health researchersaid Wednesday.   A Colorado State University study examined 51 cases of dogs withlung cancer from the files of veterinary teaching hospitals at theuniversity and the University of Illinois.   ``Dogs don't smoke and lung cancer is extremely rare in dogs,''said John Reif, a Colorado State environmental health professor atColorado State's College of Veterinary Medicine and BiomedicalSciences.   Reif said the study of dog cancer cases had shown a relationshipbetween exposure to secondhand smoke and canine lung cancer and thatit could help research on the effect of such smoke on humans.Studies have shown a relationship between secondhand smoke and lungcancer in humans.   Reif and his associates interviewed the dogs' owners about theirsmoking habits, and determined that 24 of the 51 dogs, or 47percent, had owners who smoked.   The researchers also looked at a control group of 83 dogs withother forms of cancer. Of that group, 31 dogs, or 37 percent, hadsmokers as owners, Reif said.   Based on those findings, the researchers concluded that dogs withowners who smoke were 50 percent more likely to get lung cancer.   Reif said the number of dogs in the study was low because of therarity of lung cancer in dogs. Of 15,000 dogs seen by the ColoradoState hospital, just five had the disease. The researcher said therewere no national figures.   Reid presented the study findings at the annual meeting in Julyof the American Veterinary Medical Association in Orlando, Fla.   Reif said he hopes to study more dogs. He said dogs make a goodmodel for the study of secondhand smoke's effects because they leadrelatively simple lives.   ``People's lives are highly variable. Exposure to passive smokein the workplace and at home, as well as to occupationalenvironmental hazards, can be health risks'' and make it difficultto assess secondhand smoke's effect, he said.   Reif said future studies might look at the effect of secondhandsmoke on canine nasal cancer.   Unlike humans, who have short nasal passages that cause smokeparticles to lodge more often in the lungs, dogs filter the air theybreathe through a relatively long nasal passage where many smokeparticles lodge.   Nasal cancer is more common in dogs, making a larger study grouppossible, Reif said.</TEXT></DOC>
