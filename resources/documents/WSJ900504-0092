DavidBoren (D., Okla.), an architect of the plan.</LP><TEXT>   The Democratic plan would require Senate candidates toadhere to spending limits, based on the voting-age populationof their state. In return, they would receive ataxpayer-financed subsidy to run their campaigns, as well asreduced mail and broadcast costs.   The Democratic plan would also prohibit contributions toU.S. Senate candidates by political action committees. Thisproposal follows the lead of Republican senators, who earlierthis week submitted a campaign-finance plan that wouldabolish PACs altogether.   It was unclear yesterday how many Democrats had actuallysigned onto the plan for public funds, which will bevigorously opposed by Republicans. Majority Leader GeorgeMitchell said he expected a &quot;substantial majority&quot; ofDemocrats to embrace it.   The plan would cost at least $120 million per electioncycle, according to estimates by Democratic Senate aides. Thefunds would come from a voluntary taxpayer checkoff similarto the system used for financing the presidential election.The checkoff probably would be increased to $3 per individualfrom $1 to cover the cost of congressional campaigns.   But Republican critics immediately contended that the planwould be far more costly. If House races were added, Sen.Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), who led a filibuster againstcampaign-finance legislation two years ago, predicted theDemocratic plan would cost $400 million. &quot;They surely mustknow this isn't going anywhere,&quot; Sen. McConnell saidyesterday.   &quot;Their plan sounds more like a campaign rip-off thancampaign reform,&quot; said Republican Sen. Pete Wilson ofCalifornia.   Many Republicans also oppose spending caps because mostincumbents are Democrats, and challengers usually need toraise more money to win an election.   To be eligible for the public funds under the Democraticproposal, Senate candidates would have to raise a thresholdlevel of private funds (10% of the general election spendinglimit in their state, at least half of which must come fromin-state individuals in amounts of $250 or less). Candidatesalso would be permitted to exceed the spending limits by 25%with small contributions ($100 or less) raised within thestate.   In an effort to woo moderate Republicans, the Democraticplan embraces broadcast provisions endorsed by Sen. JohnDanforth (R., Mo.). Candidates would receive vouchers forprime-time television advertisements of one to five minutesduring the eight weeks leading up to a general election. Theyalso would be required to appear on camera at the end oftheir ads to take responsibility for the content. Theseproposals would curb negative, &quot;hit-and-run&quot; campaign ads,Sen. Boren said.   The Democrats also proposed clamping down on largecontributions made by wealthy individuals to state politicalparties, known as soft money, which isn't restricted byfederal laws.   Several public-interest groups, including Common Cause andPublic Citizen, praised the Democratic plan.   But almost everyone predicts difficult negotiations ahead.&quot;This can lead to a new system that fundamentally changes theway business is conducted in Washington,&quot; said Common Cause'sFred Wertheimer, &quot;or it can lead to stalemate and status quo,a disastrous result for the country.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
