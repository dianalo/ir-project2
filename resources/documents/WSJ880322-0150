Shearson is slated to announce today it is naming 41-year-old Bernard J. Leaver a managing director and co-head of equities in London. In the past three years, Mr. Leaver has helped Hoare Govett, a Security Pacific Corp. unit, to expand its trading operations into one of the largest in the City, London's financial district. &quot;We're very happy,&quot; Jacques Gelardin, chairman of Shearson's U.K. unit, said yesterday.    A Hoare Govett spokesman said Nigel Hughes, currently deputy head of trading, will succeed Mr. Leaver. Shearson officials said Mr. Leaver will join the firm in late June.    Mr. Leaver wasn't available for comment yesterday, but London newspapers reported that the departure followed Mr. Leaver's conclusion that he wouldn't be promoted soon to run Hoare Govett's securities business.    &quot;It has been reported that he wanted to run the total equity operations,&quot; said Robert Cowell, a Hoare Govett Securities managing director. &quot;In the foreseeable future, he wasn't going to be doing that.&quot; Mr. Leaver will be missed, he added, but his departure won't affect Hoare Govett's market-making capacity.    Mr. Leaver's appointment reflects efforts by Shearson, a unit of American Express Co., to boost its U.K. equity-trading operations. Shearson has a relatively small share of the London equity-trading market and has been plagued by nagging market concern about its commitment to British equity trading since it sharply pared the stocks in which it makes markets here last year.    Robert Raziano, a Shearson executive vice president, said the appointment reflects the firm's commitment to the U.K. market. He suggested that Mr. Leaver also will help strengthen the firm's risk-management activities and expertise in European equity trading.    Mr. Leaver's arrival may cause some waves at Shearson. He will share responsibilities with Peter S. Rawlings, executive director in charge of equities in London. Mr. Rawlings wasn't available for comment last night. But Messrs. Gelardin and Raziano said they don't expect conflicts. &quot;Peter is happy to have a strong market-making partner. They genuinely get along quite well,&quot; said Mr. Raziano. </TEXT></DOC>
