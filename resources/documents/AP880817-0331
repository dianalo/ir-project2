International arms trading reached $35 billion last year, theStockholm International Peace Research Institute said in its 1988report.   It said $24.7 billion worth of weapons were delivered to ThirdWorld countries. India was the world's largest buyer with $5.2billion.   The United States, the Soviet Union, France, Britain and Chinasupplied 80 percent of the international market, said the report,written by Aaron Karp, a researcher at the institute.   The report also said Iran and Iraq have spent about $200 billionto fight their 8-year-old war, about half their total earnings fromoil. It said the war, which resulted in an estimated 1.5 millioncasualties, ``has become the most destructive conflict ever foughtbetween two Third World countries.''   The institute, an independent group mostly funded by the SwedishParliament, monitors worldwide developments in weapons and armscontrol.   Its 600-page annual report said the $35 billion of armsdelivered last year was $2.8 billion more than in 1986 and was thehighest in six years. It attributed the increase to U.S. and Sovietsupplies of jet fighters ordered in the early 1980s.   But it said developing countries are reducing their dependencyon the superpowers for weaponry, buying less and varying theirsources, and military hardware is not the foreign policy tool itwas in the 1960s and 1970s.   Developing countries, it said, cannot afford U.S.-built weaponssystems, they don't want inferior Soviet-built equipment, and theyare turning to other manufacturers.   The report said that if the wars in Afghanistan and the PersianGulf end, ``the trade in major weapons could drop precipitously.''   Last year, the Iran-Iraq war dominated the arms trade andspawned a thriving black market, according to the report.   It said Iraq spent from $11.1 billion to $13.2 billion on itswar efforts, or nearly 30 percent of its gross national product.   Iran spent an estimated $8.8 billion to $10.7 billion on the warannually, or roughly 5 percent or 6 percent of its GNP, the reportsaid.   ``Virtually all Western nations found themselves embroiled incontroversies over illegal arms sales,'' said the report. A ``graymarket'' of officially approved covert sales was thought to beworth $2 billion last year, the report said.   Illegal or covert sales to Iran in the last few years includedanti-tank missiles and Hawk anti-aircraft missiles from the UnitedStates, explosives and speedboats from Sweden, artillery shellsfrom France, and Czech AK-47 assault rifles.   Government-to-government sales dominated the arms market, withmore deals involved licensing agreements, technology transfers, andthe modernization of outdated systems.   The arms business ``is becoming less tidy. It has diversifiedinto many new forms, making the trade less predictable and harderto evaluate,'' said the report.   The institute also reported that:   _ At the end of last year, 36 major wars were in progress, asdefined by more than 1,000 fatalities.   _ The Soviet Union and the United States deployed a total of1,250 new long-range missiles last year. Britain and France movedtoward jointly producing a new missile, and China continued itsmilitary modernization.   _ The five countries that admit they have nuclear arms conductedtest explosions last year at an average rate of one per week. TheSoviets conducted 23 tests, the United States 14, France 8, China 1and Britain 1.   _ A re-examination of seismic data revealed that the UnitedStates conducted dozens of unannounced tests from 1963 to 1986.   _ Last year, 85 satellites were launched with militaryfunctions, or about 75 percent of all satellites put into orbit.The Soviet Union reported four launch failures, compared with twofor the United States, and three other Soviet satellitesmalfunctioned.</TEXT></DOC>
