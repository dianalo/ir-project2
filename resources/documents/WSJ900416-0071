Responding to new rules about the disabled and tocomplaints from young and old, manufacturers are redesigningfaucets and introducing high-tech devices that don't have tobe touched.   Kohler offers a T-shaped handle for ease of gripping. KWCAG, a Swiss company, designs a spherical handle with fingergrooves. Distributed by WSMC of Costa Mesa, Calif., thehandle is supposed to permit easy turning even for wet, soapyhands.   James Datka, marketing manager at American Standard, sees&quot;a trend away&quot; from knobs to lever faucets, which can beturned with a mere slap. Delta Faucet now makes most of itshandles comply with federal standards for the handicapped.   No-touch, infra-red faucets have sensors that react whenthey detect an object in their energy field. Hygienic andfrugal with water, infra-red technology is becoming popularin public washrooms. Drawbacks have kept them out of homes:You can't adjust the water volume, and infrared sometimes istriggered by a stray beam of sunlight.   Ultra-sound technology avoids the sunlight problem, saysKlaus Baumann, president of DAL American Inc., a faucet makerin Michigan City, Ind.   American homeowners still put faucet form ahead offunction, says Donald Norman, a cognitive scientist at theUniversity of California/San Diego. &quot;They use faucets,&quot; hesays, &quot;the way they use wristwatches -- to make statementsabout themselves.&quot;                                                                                                          Designers Draw a Line   At Certain Products                                                                                                          DESIGNERS sometimes have ideals that prevent them fromsharing ideas.   Read Viemeister of Yellow Springs, Ohio, refuses to designhighway billboards. They're &quot;a blight on the landscape,&quot; hesays. Milton Glaser of New York won't design cigarettepackaging.   Several years ago, Anita Hersh, a partner in New York'sLister Butler, led a successful effort to prevent her firmfrom designing beer packaging for Coors Brewing Co. At thetime, she believes, Coors was anti-labor and raciallydiscriminatory. In addition, Ms. Hersh claims companypatriarch Adolph Coors supported anti-Semitic causes. Coors&quot;is better now,&quot; she adds.   (Swede Johnson, Coors's vice president for corporateaffairs, replies: &quot;I'm delighted Ms. Hersh thinks we're doingbetter.&quot;)   Schecter Group recently turned down a request to designpackaging for an electronic toy that Chief Alvin Schecterdeemed &quot;exploitive&quot; of children. Meanwhile, the NewYork-based group designed herbicide and pesticide packagingfor DowElanco, a merger of parts of Dow Chemical and EliLilly. But Schecter persuaded the new company to &quot;takeresponsibility&quot; for the chemicals inside by putting its namemore prominently on the package.   Source/Inc. of Chicago refused to work on a high-proofalcoholic beverage that a longstanding client wanted to aimat the college market. William O'Connor, a partner, believesthat prosperous design firms are probably the only ones thatcan afford to turn down work on moral grounds. &quot;I don't knowwhat we would have done about that drink if we hadn't hadother work,&quot; he says.                                                                                                          Map Makers Take Off   In New Directions                                                                                                          MAP MAKERS try new ways to draw attention and conveyinformation.   Access Press Ltd. of New York has published a road atlasthat divides the U.S. into 250-mile squares, a comfortableday's drive, instead of states. Unlike most other atlases, ituses one scale throughout. White roads against a darkbackground are supposed to make the maps easier to read, evenat twilight.   Designer Richard Saul Wurman says he undertook the atlasafter planning a trip across the U.S., &quot;only to find thatthere were absolutely no road maps I could understand.&quot;   New York's VanDam Inc. brings out &quot;The Cosmos Unfolds,&quot; aseries of &quot;ecoguides&quot; to the rain forest, ocean, universe,desert, Mars and the Moon, combining science and history. Theguides, made of stiff paper, unfold to six times theiroriginal area and automatically spring back to their foldswhen the user's done.   MicroGuide, a Teaneck, N.J., company, makes credit-cardsize maps of the New York subway system, Washington, D.C.,and other spots. The maps pop into a box shape to be viewedthrough a built-in magnifying lens.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          TO HELP SAVE the rain forest, Nienkamper Furniture ofToronto introduces office furniture that looks like it's madefrom tropical hardwoods but is actually from composites ofmaple and other plentiful woods. . . .
