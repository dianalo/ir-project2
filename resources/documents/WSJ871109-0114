The rate of acceptance was far below the usual acceptance level for a British rights issue. Underwriters will buy the remaining shares.    Kleinwort offered holders the right to buy one new ordinary share for every three held at 450 pence each. But the bank set the purchase price before the recent collapse in the London stock market, which made the terms unattractive.    On Thursday, the last day holders could exercise their rights, Kleinwort's shares closed at 425 pence each on London's stock exchange, 25 pence below the offering price. The shares were down 20 pence at 405 pence Friday afternoon.    Kleinwort only achieved a 15.6% acceptance rate because the Kleinwort, Benson and Lonsdale family interests, which owned about one-third of the ordinary shares before the rights issue, previously committed themselves to exercising a portion of their rights, said Christopher Eugster, a director at Kleinwort's merchant bank subsidiary.    Family interests accounted for &quot;a substantial proportion&quot; of rights which were exercised, he said. Following the offering, the family interests still control more than 25% of the firm's shares, he added.    Another British company, Ladbroke Group PLC, said last week that holders took up only 2.6% of its #256 million rights issue. </TEXT></DOC>
