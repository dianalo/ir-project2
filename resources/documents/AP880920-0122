The launch Monday, which made Israel the eighth nation to placea satellite in space, provoked sharp protests from Arab neighbors.   A state-run newspaper in Syria, Israel's main enemy in theMiddle East, accused the United States of helping launch thesatellite and said it would threaten the Arab world.   ``As part of the (Israeli-U.S.) strategic alliance, the enemylaunched a spy satellite with the help of the United States...formilitary purposes. This is a new threat to the Arab nation,'' theTishrin newspaper said.   But Charles Redman, the State Department spokesman, denied theUnited States had any involvement in the launch.   Pentagon officials say they are unsure what is in thesatellite's payload. ``We're leaning toward more of an experimentalcommunications package as opposed to a true spy satellite,'' saidone source who demanded anonymity.   In Washington, Arab League representative Clovis Maksoud saidthe satellite gave Israel ``a serious strategic leverage'' sincethe country already had the capability to fire long-range missiles.   The Libyan news agency JANA, monitored in London, described thecraft as a ``spy satellite (and part of a) psychological war beingcarried out by the Zionists against the Arab nation.''   Newspaper editorials in other Arab capitals urged Arabs to poolresources to match Israel's technological advances.   Ortas denied claims the 340-pound test satellite, named HorizonI, was carrying surveillance equipment.   ``We aren't getting pictures. We don't have anything to getpictures from. There is no means to get pictures,'' said Ortas,vice president of the electronics division of the agency thatlaunched the satellite.   A spokesman for the London-based magazine Jane's Defense Weeklysaid the satellite was carrying a 6.6-pound payload forsurveillance purposes, apparently for monitoring activity in Arabcountries.   Because Israel is not thought to have the capability ofinstalling sophisticated surveillance equipment in a satellite,U.S. optical equipment was believed to be aboard, the spokesmanadded.   Tony Banks, a Jane's reporter with close ties to the Israelimilitary, said the satellite was unlikely to provide much usefulsurveillance because of the direction of its orbit.   ``It only gets two decent passes in any 24-hour period over Arabcountries and one of these is during darkness which means no sightcapability except, perhaps, by infrared light, which is not asgood,'' Banks said.   ``It's very chancey it's going to see anything at all,'' he saidin an interview Monday from London.   Israeli officials said the craft was expected to stay aloft fora month.   Development of the craft came after more than 20 years ofIsraeli space research and was seen as part of the country's effortto become independent in the defense field.   Until now, Israel has relied on the United States to providesatellite pictures, but some former Israeli officials havecomplained the United States was stingy in supplying intelligenceinformation.   In March 1987, former U.S. Navy analyst Jonathan Jay Pollard wassentenced to life in prison for selling Israel hundreds of U.S.military documents.   Israeli media have quoted U.S. and Israeli sources as saying thedocuments Pollard delivered included satellite pictures of Iraqiand Syrian weapons and storage facilities.   A recent source of possible concern to Israel is that SaudiArabia is deploying Chinese-built, CSS-2 missiles 285 miles southof Riyadh.   Satellite photographs displayed by Space Media Network, aprivate Swedish company, showed the Saudis were expanding anairstrip and a military complex to accommodate the new weapons.   Maj. Gen. Yehoshua Saguy, a retired head of militaryintelligence, said earlier this week that Israel would save moneyon reconnaisance flights by conventional aircraft and drones.   Saguy said another benefit to Israel of having its own satellitewas they pose fewer political problems than surveillance aircraftor pilotless planes.</TEXT></DOC>
