The order, effective immediately, will bar the importation ofmore than 110,000 such weapons for which import applications arepending, said national drug control director William J. Bennett.   Bennett said Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady ``decided tosuspend, effective immediately, the importation of several makes ofassault-type weapons pending a decision as to whether these weaponsare, as required by law, `particularly suitable for or readilyadaptable to sporting purposes','' Bennett said.   Bennett and Brady had been asked to look into ways of dealingwith the proliferation of such weapons amid mounting violence amongdrug dealers in inner city areas.   The decision came after conferences among Brady, Bennett andStephen E. Higgins, the director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobaccoand Firearms, who supported the decision.   ``They've been conferring during the last week,'' said ATFspokesman Dick Pedersen. ``Higgins and Bennett together felt it wastime to suspend the importation, so we are doing that.''   In the past three years, ATF has approved the import of 88,000such weapons, and in 1989 so far, the ATF has received requests toimport many more than the total imported during the previous threeyears, Bennett said in a statement.   Affected by the decision are imports of AK-47s, Uzi carbines,FN-FAL and FN-FNC-type weapons as well as Steyr Aug semiautomaticweapons.   ``ATF has the authority to regulate the importation of weaponsinto the United States, to make sure they fall into certaincategories,'' Pedersen said. ``We're saying some of these weaponsmay not fall into some of the prescribed categories, such ashunting.''   ``We're not going to approve these pending applications until wehave time to look at the situation further to see if these firearmsdo meet the conditions set forth for their importation,'' he said.   Bush, a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association, hadvoiced concerns about the weapons but said he also wanted to ``dowhat's right by the legitimate sportsman.''   White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen said the import ban wasdecided on after it was learned that applications for importedsemiautomatics had tripled this year over the total for the pastthree years.   The administration action came a day after the California StateAssembly voted to ban 40 types of semiautomatic assault weapons.That legislation must be reconciled with an earlier vote by theCalifornia State Senate to ban all semiautomatic weapons fitting acertain description.</TEXT></DOC>
