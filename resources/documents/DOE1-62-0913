The principlepurpose of constructing this pond is to provide a tool to knowledge ofthe pond behaviour and it use as a facility for the collection and seasonalstorage of solar energy. The project will investigate measurement methodsof radiation transmission and extensive computer calculations will bemade of ground heat loss from solar pond. The results of these activitieswill be used to formulate optimized solar pond designs and used to createsolar pond energy utilization maps for Spain.</TEXT></DOC>
