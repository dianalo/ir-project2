BulkeleyStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 05/28/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> WANBCOMPUTERS (EDP) </IN><DATELINE> LOWELL, Mass.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Wang Laboratories Inc. joined the growing ranks of companies building personal computers based on Intel Corp.'s 80386 microprocessor and announced a desktop publishing system as well.    The company, which unveiled two personal computers -- one using the newest Intel chip and one using a slightly older version -- said the machines will be compatible with existing PC-AT personal computers made by International Business Machines Corp. In the past, Wang personal computers have used a different operating system, which meant that many software programs had to be rewritten to run on the Wang machines.    Winfried Burke, a director in the computer maker's desktop division, said that Wang doesn't expect to sell the computers retail but rather will emphasize selling them as part of Wang networks in which they will be connected to Wang's minicomputers. &quot;Our PCs are part of larger computer systems,&quot; he said.    Mr. Burke said Wang has sold some 400,000 of its own personal computers in the past five years and is selling about $600 million of personal computers a year. He said the company is providing software that will make its older systems compatible with the new ones.    Wang's most powerful new personal computer, the Professional Computer 380, costs $6,495 without a display screen or hard disk. Its new Professional Computer 280, which uses the older Intel 80286 microprocessor, has a base price of $3,850.    While neither system is as cheap as those made by low-priced clone makers, Mr. Burke said that they are competitive with IBM and other name-brand computers.    Wang said it already has shipped some 4,000 of the new personal computers to customers as part of its plan to develop manufacturing capacity before announcing the systems. Mr. Burke said he believes Wang is the first computer systems maker to ship an 80386-based computer.    The company said it expects that some of the latest personal computers will be used in its new desktop publishing system, which uses a popular software program called PageMaker from Seattle-based Aldus Corp. The system, which companies can use to design and publish brochures, pamphlets and newsletters, also includes a new $8,000 laser printer.    In the future, Wang said, it will introduce expanded corporate publishing systems that link its own systems to those made by Texet Inc., Cambridge, Mass. </TEXT></DOC>
