Travel was treacherous after Hurricane Hugo's 125 mph windssnapped power lines across this Caribbean island's hard-hitnortheastern sections as the storm skirted the coast on anorth-northwestern tack Monday.   Flooding was widespread, with surging waters reaching up to thehoods of cars. The high water forced this correspondent to turn backafter attempting to reach the international airport, where damagedplanes included a DC-3 that had been tossed onto a hangar.   Authorities said nearly 28,000 people lost homes in the storm.There were no immediate reports of deaths.   Bands of youths looted stores in San Juan, while others scavengedrubble and metal from storm-damaged buildings. Some carted awaytruckloads of aluminium siding and zinc roofing.   People on foot struggled to carry loads they could barely handle.   In the ritzy Condado Beach neighborhood, perhaps the city'sworst-hit area, most hotels had windows blown out and hotel awningslay shattered on the ground. Many palm trees were uprooted, otherslost their fronds.   As the storm receded and dusk fell, clean-up crews started workwith bulldozers to remove the debris from city streets. Waist-deepwaters in some areas of the city prevented any salvage work.   San Juan remained in total darkness Monday night, with noestimate of when power might be returned to the capital.Communication with the outside world, completely cut during thestorm's height, was gradually being restored.   Six hours after the worst winds, thousands of people cruised SanJuan's streets in cars, looking at the damage and causing trafficjams citywide.   Residents of one San Juan neighborhood said its tall buildingsswayed in the winds, and one said it felt like being aboard a ship.The rain blew sideways and pieces of metal and other debris flewthrough the air.   In a boutique on the ground floor of the two-story buildinghousing the Associated Press bureau in San Juan, young lootersdefied winds hitting 100 mph at the height of the storm and carriedout armloads of women's clothing. The AP buro's office was nearlydestroyed in the storm by broken glass and rain.   A giant Banyan tree lay across a major avenue, its roots stickingin the air. The Bal do Rioty avenue, which leads from the hotel zoneto the international airport, was lined with fallen almond trees.   Many cars lay damaged by fallen trees and one car was completelyflattened by a concrete slab from a nearby building.   In a working-class section of San Juan, utility poles tilted forblocks with wires dangling, making streets nearly impassable.</TEXT></DOC>
