<DOC><DOCNO> WSJ880913-0083 </DOCNO><HL> REVIEW andamp; OUTLOOK (Editorial): Creature of the Caucus </HL><SO> </SO><G> EXE </G><TEXT>   Michael Dukakis is giving speeches this week on national security, partly his advisers say to blunt George Bush's claim that the Governor is a callow dove. We'll see if Mr. Dukakis can leap the tall building of his previously stated views, but if he's serious he might start by saying how he disagrees with the House Democratic Caucus.    We say this because so far the Governor's speeches and position papers suggest a world view that is as far to the left as that of any major presidential nominee since George McGovern, and maybe since Henry Wallace left the Democractic Party in 1948 to run on a program opposing the Marshall Plan, proposing disarmament and calling for the destruction of atom bomb stockpiles. The Governor's view seems to be the one that since Vietnam has come to dominate the party activists and especially the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives.    And it is the view Michael Dukakis seems to embrace. &quot;What you see here is an example of the way we're going to make national security policy beginning in January 1989, with a President and Congress that work together,&quot; Mr. Dukakis declared on Sunday. He had just concluded a meeting on defense issues with a group that included such luminaries of the Democratic left as Senators Carl Levin and John Kerry, and Reps. Louis Stokes, Nicholas Mavroules and Norman Dicks.    A Democratic realist or two -- Senator Sam Nunn and Rep. Les Aspin -- also attended, though we wonder how they reconcile Mr. Dukakis's views with their own, not to mention with their party's heritage going to back to John F. Kennedy or Harry Truman. For example:   --A bipartisan postwar consensus has sustained a policy of &quot;containment&quot; against Soviet and communist expansion. Mr. Dukakis supports containment in Europe, but he won't support freedom-fighters in the Third World. He prefers the House Caucus's anti-Contra policy that has done so much for democracy in Nicaragua. And while a few hawkish Democrats have joined Republicans in supporting Jonas Savimbi against the Cubans in Angola, Gov. Dukakis agrees with the House left that such support is &quot;absolutely bizarre.&quot;    --Mr. Dukakis says he favors nuclear deterrence, but he opposes or fudges on modernizing weapons that would maintain a survivable U.S. &quot;triad.&quot; He wouldn't deploy either the D-5 submarine missile or the Stealth bomber until he sees how arms talks work out, as if the Soviets will show similar restraint. As for a new land-based deterrent, Mr. Dukakis has recently changed his mind to endorse one in concept, yet he still opposes both of the proposals on the table, the MX and Midgetman missiles. Such moderate Democrats as Rep. Aspin support Midgetman, but the Caucus left doesn't.    --The postwar consensus has depended on a bipartisan foreign policy led by the executive. But Mr. Dukakis would be the first President ever to endorse the War Powers Act that even Democratic senators claim enfeebles U.S. ability to respond to a foreign threat.    --Most U.S. Presidents, Democrat or Republican, have had to use military force to protect U.S. interests. But Mr. Dukakis has opposed nearly every U.S. military action during the Reagan years, from Grenada to the Persian Gulf. When the Massachusetts national guard was called to show the flag in Central America, Governor Dukakis even went to court -- unsuccessfully -- to prevent them from going. The Governor says he doesn't rule out force as a &quot;last resort,&quot; but he'd rely first on &quot;multilateral&quot; diplomacy. Does he really believe that the U.N. is more responsible than U.S. Stingers for the Soviet decision to leave Afghanistan?    The depressing weight of all this has led former defense secretary James Schlesinger to ask in Time magazine if Mr. Dukakis isn't &quot;viscerally anti-military.&quot; Yesterday, President Carter's national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, said he believed George Bush was better able to &quot;fashion an effective bipartisan foreign policy.&quot;    So far this week, Mr. Dukakis has responded by repeating that he'll spend more on conventional weapons (worthwhile but expensive), asserting that economic strength is as important as military strength (who could disagree?), and attacking Mr. Bush as soft on terrorism, drugs and Noriega (but what would he do instead?). He has also stopped calling strategic defense a &quot;fantasy,&quot; though he'd still gut its funding and he remains evasive about testing or deployment.    If Mr. Dukakis is looking for something better this week, he could do worse than look past the positions that dominate today's House caucus to his own party's distinguished past. Harry Truman didn't agree with the Henry Wallace crowd. He ran against them. </TEXT></DOC>
