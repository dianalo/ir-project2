The university's medical school announced it had receiveda $12 million personal gift from Mr. Gates that allowed theschool to lure a star molecular biologist, Leroy Hood, awayfrom California Institute of Technology.</LP><TEXT>   The Caltech biologist will move to Seattle from Pasadena,Calif., next summer to set up a new molecular biotechnologydepartment in which molecular biologists will work closelywith mathematicians, physicists and computer scientists. Themedical school in Seattle is just a stone's throw fromMicrosoft's headquarters in suburban Redmond, Wash.   Mr. Gates has previously shown interest in biotechnology.He holds a 10% interest in a small Seattle-based company,Icos Corp. The company was organized last year and financedby several hundred venture capitalists and corporateexecutives to explore new ways of controlling the problem ofinflammation that characterizes many diseases, such asarthritis.   The 52-year-old Dr. Hood is a leading researcher on themolecular makeup of proteins and of the genes that are theblueprints for proteins. He and his colleagues at Caltech arebest-known for developing machines to determine automaticallythe sequence of molecules in proteins and genes. Dr. Hood andthe machines he is developing are playing key roles in theHuman Genome Initiative, a federally funded effort toidentify all human genes and to determine the sequence of thethree billion molecules that constitute human DNA, thechemical of which the genes are made.   The 35-year-old Mr. Gates, an expert in computerprogramming and a co-founder of Microsoft, said &quot;The wholearea {of molecular biology} fascinates me. After computers,it's the most interesting, most impactful area in researchtoday.&quot; Both he and Dr. Hood noted that molecular biologyresearch such as the human genome project is going to neednew &quot;computational tools&quot; to make sense of all the newinformation being uncovered.   The $12 million gift, which the university said was thelargest single gift it has ever received, was of interest to&quot;Gates watchers&quot; who have been wondering when, where and howthe young billionaire would continue his family's traditionof philanthropy.   Dr. Hood's decision to leave Caltech and move to theUniversity of Washington in Seattle is a major bit of news inacademic circles. &quot;We've been trying to interest Lee incoming to Washington for some time, and Mr. Gates finallymade it possible,&quot; said Philip J. Fialkow, dean of theUniversity of Washington medical school.   Less than a year ago, Dr. Hood was being ardently courtedby the University of California, Berkeley, to head theDepartment of Energy's Human Genome Center at the LawrenceBerkeley Laboratory. Earlier this year, however, thebiologist yielded to last-minute entreaties from Caltech anddecided to stay at the Pasadena institution.   At Caltech, Dr. Hood founded and heads the Science andTechnology Center, which has a budget of $3.5 million a year.The future of the center &quot;is under active review,&quot; a Caltechspokesman said. &quot;Lee Hood has been a visionary leader inbiology at Caltech and we shall miss his many contributions,&quot;Caltech President Thomas E. Everhart said in a statement.   Dr. Hood has been a Caltech faculty member since 1970. Thescientist did his undergraduate work at Caltech, thenobtained a medical degree at Johns Hopkins Medical School in1964 before returning to Caltech to get his doctorate inbiology in 1968.   Dr. Hood said he decided to move to the University ofWashington because not only will he be able to set up his owndepartment, but the university is giving him the opportunity&quot;to bring along my very best people.&quot; He said he hopes topersuade at least 15 to 20 of the 40 scientists working withhim at Caltech to move to Seattle. He also noted that atWashington he will be able to work with well-knownresearchers in immunology, genetic diseases and autoimmunediseases, medical areas that dovetail with his research inmolecular biotechnology. Caltech doesn't have a medicalschool.</TEXT></DOC>
