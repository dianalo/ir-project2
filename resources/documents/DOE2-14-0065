Advantages of PLC's include reduced developmentand training time that is possible because of standardized developmentand documentation. The standardization also simplifies troubleshootingand spare part requirements. The National Electrical Manufacturers Association(NEMA) defines a PLC as a digital electronic apparatus with a programmablememory for storing instructions to implement specific functions suchas logic sequencing, timing, counting, and arithmetic, to control machinesand processes.</TEXT></DOC>
