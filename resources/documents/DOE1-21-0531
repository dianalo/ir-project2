In all, 111 patients on anti anginal treatment underwentcoronary arteriography and stress thallium imaging; 39 showed singlevessel disease (SVD), and 72 multivessel disease (MVD). Sensitivity ofblack and white analog images was 82% for SVD and 8% for MVD. Sensitivityof computerized colored static images was 87% for SVD and 33% for MVD.For gated images, sensitivity was 100% and 92% in patients with SVD andMVD respectively. Specificity for detecting MVD was 95% for black andwhite images, 77% for computerized colored static images, and 69% forECG gated images. Thus, ECG gated exercise /sup 201/Tl scintigraphy isuseful for predicting the extent of coronary artery disease 1-3 monthsafter myocardial infarction in patients on anti anginal therapy.</TEXT></DOC>
