That's progress of a sort, but it leaves the strategic defense initiative still in much doubt.    The resignation of SDI Director James A. Abrahamson, announced earlier in the week, was certainly not the act of a man pleased with the political support he is receiving. Indeed, one of the pettiest moves yet made in the SDI struggle was Senate blockage of the promotion of Lt. Gen. Abrahamson to four-star rank, apparently out of fear this would give SDI too much prestige. So SDI's chief will retire to civilian life next year and the government will lose another talented manager.    This is an issue deserving of more debate than it has so far received in this presidential campaign. Vice President Bush has not made a big issue of SDI but said in the presidential debate last Sunday, &quot;When it is deployable, I will deploy it.&quot; Governor Dukakis has adopted the language of SDI's enemies, calling &quot;star wars&quot; a fraud. But he said he nonetheless would fund research at $1 billion a year; this would be wasted money, for at that level no one thinks SDI can be developed.    Indeed, the current $4.1 billion is &quot;woefully inadequate,&quot; even for research, in the view of someone as well informed as Air Force Chief of Staff Larry D. Welch. General Welch visited with our editors recently, and some of his observations are worth recording in light of this week's events. While inside the bureaucracy the Air Force is scarcely known as an SDI booster, he said the program would logically be headed for a decision on deployment in 1992. But he thinks the congressional funding is not enough even for that kind of research program, &quot;At that rate, we'll never see SDI.&quot;    The original argument of SDI critics, of course, was that missile defense is not feasible technically. The true extent of what might be technically feasible when a deployment decision will be made is simply not knowable, but Randamp;D work has been progressing remarkably well considering the obstacles that have been put in its way.    The Russians, meanwhile, are working away at a land-based missile defense system, having negotiated the ABM treaty, now so much praised in the Senate, so as to leave as much room as possible for what they had in mind. By almost every serious account, they have gone beyond the treaty's limits in building the Krasnoyarsk phased-array radar, which could be a key element in a nationwide command and control system that would form the core of a nationwide ballistic missile defense. Once command and control is in place, it is a simple matter to deploy ABM missiles, thereby achieving a complete breakout from the ABM's treaty's restrictions on nationwide defense.    Yet the Senate and Mike Dukakis want no parallel U.S. effort. This is at a time, of course, when Soviet missiles are by no means the only potential threat to the U.S. The Chinese, for example, can build large missiles and even recently wanted to sell some to the Saudis. It is only a matter of time until any potential enemy of the United States, even a terrorist state, would have at least the possibility of mounting a missile raid on U.S. territory. The &quot;destabilization&quot; argument is a dangerous fraud because a process of destabilization already is under way.    Given these realities, even an expensive system ought to attract support. What's the problem? &quot;As soon as the President announced his vision of an SDI, there was an immediate opposition to the idea,&quot; General Welch recalled. &quot;It wasn't an argument over whether SDI was technically feasible. It was an argument over whether defense is destabilizing, and I think that is an absolutely nonsensical argument. We have no defense system worthy of the name. This tremendous opposition to introducing a defensive element to the U.S. deterrent strategy has to be one of the most mysterious pieces of political chemistry we've seen.&quot;    It is this curious chemistry, the notion that somehow defensive missiles are immoral and offensive ones are not, that animates the hostility to SDI shown in the Senate or the Dukakis campaign. It is with this sentiment that the Reagan administration has now compromised, perhaps compromising our national security as well. Against this kind of opposition, we wonder whether the cool rationality of General Welch's 1992 decision or George Bush's &quot;when deployable&quot; will ever carry the day. The alternative, as we saw in the Kennedy moonlanding program, is to fight the deployment decision now, and learn how to do it as we go along. </TEXT></DOC>
