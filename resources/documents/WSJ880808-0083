Although discussions are continuing on defense spending and capital endowments to state-owned companies, officials say the broad lines of the budget are clear. Discussions on revenue come next, but the government has said there would be few major changes.    The government appears to be pursuing a policy of selective austerity, largely continuing the former conservative administration's rigorous management of the economy while increasing spending in a few areas.    The budget, which goes to parliament this fall, is seen as highly important politically because it will be the first major test of whether France's first minority government since 1958 can survive.    Under the draft budget, expenditures will rise by about 4.5% to about 1.13 trillion francs ($178.28 billion), but this increase will be offset by slightly higher growth in fiscal receipts because of solid economic growth and fewer tax cuts. This should allow the government to narrow the budget deficit to 100 billion francs ( $15.78 billion) from a projected shortage of 115 billion francs for 1988.    Government officials and independent economists say the budget is restrictive. Officials say they are cutting more expenditures than the former government because the 1989 budget won't include proceeds from the denationalization of state-owned companies, which the previous government used to cut public debt and provide capital to state-owned companies. The Socialists have pledged to halt privatizations. </TEXT></DOC>
