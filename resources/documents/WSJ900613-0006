The company has 30 days to respond to the proposedpenalty.</LP><TEXT>   The regulatory agency's findings relate to an air-ionizer3M manufactured in the mid-1980s. By early 1988, the NRCordered a recall of some models of the ionizers, whichcontained microscopic metal spheres that held particles of aradioactive source, polonium 210.   The recall was ordered after agency investigators foundthat the ionizers, or static-removing devices, leakedradioactivity at some customers' industrial plants. Theleakage was at levels so low that it didn't represent asignificant health hazard, and consumer products made at theaffected plants showed no contamination.   The company later expanded the recall to include allionizer models containing the radioactive material, andhalted those models' production.   The company said it is &quot;surprised by the size of theproposed penalty,&quot; given the company's cooperation andcompliance with NRC's requests. It is &quot;studying the specificsof the allegations and will respond.&quot;   The NRC said it found seven violations. Among them, itsaid 3M failed to make sure customers would use the devicesin &quot;acceptable environments.&quot; It also said the company didn'tcheck returned ionizers for surface contamination, a processthat would identify any leaking devices that should beclassified unacceptable.   The agency said 3M also failed to tell customers how theleaking ionizers should be handled, and to provide the NRCwith complete reports.</TEXT></DOC>
