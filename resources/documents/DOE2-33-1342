Two failures with thevariable-angle swash-plate drive system limited testing to low powerlevels. These failures are not thought to be caused by problems inherentin the variable-stroke concept but they do emphasize the need for carefuldesign in the area of the crossheads where the failures occurred. Thispaper describes these failures and the efforts to resolve the associatedproblems, and presents test results that were obtained. 5 refs., 17 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
