Byrd appealedto the Kremlin on Tuesday to help end the dispute over on-siteinspection that is blocking Senate action on the medium-rangemissile treaty.   ``The Soviets hold the key,'' Byrd told the Senate.   But Byrd said that although Senate action on the pact has beentemporarily ``put on the back burner,'' he could call it up fordebate Friday if negotiations in Geneva between Secretary of StateGeorge P. Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadzeresolve the issue.   Byrd said he would need an iron-clad commitment from the Sovietsin writing.   President Reagan had urged the Senate to ratify theIntermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty before his Moscow summitwith Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev begins May 29. However,White House officials acquiesced Monday in the bipartisan decisionby Senate leaders to delay debate on the treaty due to theoutstanding disputes.   The chairman and vice chairman of the Senate IntelligenceCommittee said, meanwhile, that the treaty cannot be ratified ifthe Soviets continue to balk on on-site verification procedures.   Chairman David Boren, D-Okla. and Vice Chairman William Cohen,D-Maine, commented after delivering a report to Senate leadersapparently resolving an unrelated dispute over the inclusion in thetreaty of such futuristic weapons as those employing laser rays orparticle beam generators.   The treaty is silent on such weapons although administrationnegotiators contended futuristic weapons were included under thepact's ban on any medium-range weapon, no matter what it uses todestroy or damage a target.   ``While there are many problems associated with monitoringfuturistic weapons, ... the committee believes that on balance U.S.interests in monitoring the treaty are better served by banningmissiles using current or future weapons technologies to damage ordestroy a target than by excluding them from the scope of thetreaty,'' the panel's letter said.   Otherwise, the committee contended, U.S. intelligence would behard pressed to tell the difference between unbanned futuristicweapons and those armed with nuclear or conventional warheads whichwere banned.   Cohen said the remaining roadblock remains the ``untenable''position he said the Soviets have taken on on-site inspection.   ``There has to be an absolute meeting of the minds on thatbefore I can agree to support the treaty, Cohen said.   He added that unless the Soviets back down and resolve thedispute, ``the treaty cannot be ratified.''   Boren added: ``It's just a matter of whether the Soviets havethe political will to say they are willing to live up to thecommitments on on-site inspection.   ``If they don't have that will, then there is a very seriousproblem for the treaty,'' he said. ``Some vague, cosmetic languagecoming back from Geneva just won't do the trick.''   Earlier, some Democratic senators reportedly protested delay onthe treaty _ which requires the elimination of all ground-launchedmissiles with a range of 315 to 3,125 miles _ expressing concernthat Reagan and Gorbachev would be unable to make further armscontrol progress at their Moscow summit if the accord is notratified by then.   But Byrd declared: ``The Senate would certainly look foolish togo into debate with these matters that need fixing hanging outthere.''   ``I can't go ahead with it if there are multitudinous or evenone gap through which the Soviets can cheat,'' said Byrd, D-W.Va.   Speaking to reporters, he said, ``It could be resolved in amatter of hours, in a matter of days, or it might never beresolved.''   Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., told the Senate: ``We are asking theSoviets to put up or shut up on on-site inspection.''   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee, said on-site inspection represents the chief value ofthe treaty to the arms control process, because it can lead the wayto effective verification of a far more sweeping agreement toreduce long-range nuclear weapons by as much as 50 percent.   The issue will be discussed when Shultz confers withShevardnadze at Geneva on Wednesday and Thursday. Nunn said it isimportant that it be satisfactorily resolved at that time.   Byrd agreed, saying, ``The Soviets can resolve this fast. Thething that can expedite this is for the administration and theSoviets to sit down and close these loopholes.''   ``We don't want to give the Soviets loopholes to cheat,'' hesaid. ``This obviously needs fixing and the time to fix it isbefore the Senate takes up the treaty.''   Nunn told the Senate: ``We will learn whether we indeed have abreakthrough in on-site inspection. If on-site inspection fails wewill have a catastrophe.''   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater saidthe administration backs the delay in the Senate debate.   ``We feel this is a prudent and reasonable course of action,''he said. ``There is unanimity between the administration and thebipartisan Senate leadership that these problems should besatisfactorily and promptly resolved prior to ratification.''   Assistant Senate Republican Leader Alan Simpson of Wyoming andSen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., emerging from a morning meeting withPresident Reagan, said they were confident that the problems can besurmounted.   ``I think that they will do their usual good job of splicingthings back together again,'' Simpson said, referring to theShultz-Shevardnadze meeting.</TEXT></DOC>
