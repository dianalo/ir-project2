Volume was generally light in trading already described as slowing down for the holidays.    In Tokyo, share prices rose as electrical blue-chip issues, retailers and paper and pulp shares finished higher.    The Nikkei index of 225 selected stocks, which fell 72.86 points Friday, rose 129.87 points to 22956.84. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section index gained 6.96 to 1840.44. First section volume was pegged at 500 million shares, down from 550 million shares Friday.    In early trading Tuesday in Tokyo, share prices fell. The Nikkei index was down 141.05 to 22815.79 at the end of the morning session.    Traders said the dollar's opening at 127.25 yen in Tokyo Monday, compared with 126.45 yen Friday, was sufficient to keep share prices in the plus column all day despite the U.S. currency's later slip to the 126.70 yen area in afternoon dealings.    Though the dollar's fall from its intraday highs generated some profit-taking in construction, heavy industrial and other sectors, one broker noted sentiment stayed firm on flurries of weekend news reports speculating that Group of Seven monetary nations are preparing to issue a joint communique stressing currency stability once Washington announces final implementation of its budget deficit-cutting plan.    In electrical and computer makers, communications and instrument benchmarks surged on bargain-hunting induced by the recent weakness in share prices. The strong advance was partly aided by the jump in Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone prices. NTT, a weather vane for communications-related issues, rose 110,000 points to 2.38 million yen a share. Advantest, an instrument maker, soared 390 to 5,850 ($46.25). Ando Electric, specializing in electronic measuring devices, was up 220 to 3,400. Hitachi Cable was up 20 to 1,120.    Certain specialty steels gained in Monday's bullish trading on prodding from large brokerages stressing the promise of improved earnings because of an upsurge in public works and construction spending. Daido rose 33 to 573. Tokyo Steel, however, fell 80 to 3,300 on profit-taking, reflecting investor feelings the issue is overbought and that the company's good earnings prospects have already been absorbed by share prices.    Share prices in London closed higher in thin trading, helped by some light institutional buying, continued strong British takeover activity and stability in the dollar.    The Financial Times 30-share index was up 27.3 points at 1405.1. Volume eased to 576.8 million shares from 630.1 million Friday. The 100-share index was up 33.2 points at 1750.2.    Dealers said there was some new institutional money flowing into the market with few sellers to be found. Trading was light, which accentuated the upward movement in prices, they said.    In addition, the dollar's stability helped equities. A chief dealer said expectations that U.S. officials could soon conclude a budget package boosted optimism. Such a package likely would be followed by renewed international efforts to stabilize currencies, he said.    A spate of takeover activity has underpinned confidence in the British corporate sector in recent sessions. Continued stake-building Monday added to this positive sentiment, with much of the activity continuing in the oil sector, dealers said.    London andamp; Scottish Marine Oil said it boosted its stake in Enterprise Oil to 25.3% from 24.7%. The company has said it is aiming for a 29.9% stake. London andamp; Scottish shares were up 4 pence to 269 pence ($8.90), while Enterprise shares gained 10 to 258. British Petroleum said it has been informed by the Kuwait Investment Office that KIO now owns 957.5 million BP shares, or 16.1%, up from 15% announced last week. BP's new partly paid shares were unchanged at 70.5 pence, while its regular shares gained 13 to 251.    Share prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange closed higher in thin trading, as the dollar recovered slightly from Friday's record lows. The currency was set at 1.6293 marks at Monday's Frankfurt foreign exchange fixing, up from Friday's record low fixing of 1.6218.    &quot;The dollar helped this afternoon,&quot; one broker at a large West German bank in Frankfurt said, adding that traders are also speculating that the G-7 countries may meet and decide to work together to support the U.S. currency.    Despite advancing prices, volume was thin. &quot;Many investors have closed their books for the year,&quot; one broker at another Frankfurt bank said. &quot;Unless there is some major foreign exchange movement, volume will be low until the new year.&quot;    Among automobile shares, Bayerische Motoren Werke rallied 19 marks to 472 marks ($290), Daimler-Benz added 12 to 615, and Volkswagen increased 6.5 to 234.    Financial shares closed higher as Deutsche Bank added 5 to 413.5, Dresdner Bank rose 5.5 to 238.5, and Commerzbank climbed 4 to 226.5.    Stocks also closed higher in Paris, Zurich, Amsterdam and Stockholm. Shares were mixed in Brussels and lower in Milan.    Paris traders said Friday's gains on Wall Street, coupled with expectations of a statement from G-7 countries, were the main factors behind the day's renewed confidence. Dealers in Zurich said the dollar's stability supported prices.    In Asian markets, shares closed higher in Singapore, Sydney, Manila and Hong Kong and were lower in Wellington and Taipei.    The rise was sharp in Hong Kong on heavy buying by local investors, producing the heaviest trading the market has seen in a month. Brokers said small players were encouraged by Friday's strong showing on Wall Street, among other factors.
