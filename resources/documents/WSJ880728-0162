The July 1 deadline for companies to comply with federal right-to-know laws by disclosing the presence of toxic chemicals has boosted business for environmental specialists. But consultants, lawyers and public relations firms say the real boom is yet to come. &quot;Environmental laws are coming to a new stage of explosive growth,&quot; says New York lawyer Martin Baker of Rosenman andamp; Colin. Legal challenges won't come from the federal legislation, but from the stringent local laws that will follow it, explains Ronald Janke of the law firm Jones, Day, Reavis andamp; Pogue, Cleveland.    Big companies already are using public relations firms to blunt community concern about the disclosures. Come fall, many small firms probably will do the same, says Ronald Lang of the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturers Association. Consultants who helped inventory chemicals for the July 1 filing will get new clients as the levels required for disclosure decline, he says.    Planning ahead, ENSR Corp., owner of an air-pollution consulting group, adds a medical unit able to study the impact on health.    HEMLINES HOVER at the knee as retailers gear up for fall.    &quot;The terrible hemline confusion we had last year appears to be dead,&quot; says retail consultant Kurt Barnard, New York. Still, many retailers -- hurt when women left too many short skirts on the rack -- play it safe by offering a variety of lengths. About 85% of designer clothing is &quot;around the knee&quot;; 15% are &quot;novelty lengths,&quot; says Ruth Britten, a New York fashion consultant.    Hoping that a strong fashion statement will boost buying, stores are featuring bright, atypical fall colors. &quot;Purple is going to be huge for fall,&quot; says Tobe Associates. Stores also are betting on business clothes. Limited Inc. bumps weekend wear from the first floor of its New York store, replacing it with dressy ensembles and Chanel-style suits. But retailers purposely keep inventories low. And prices will be up 10% to 20% from last fall, says Mrs. Britten, noting stores want to insulate themselves against markdowns in case sales stay soft.    WEATHER WORRIES have some forecasters taking a longer view.    Short-term predicting dominates U.S. weather projects, says Paul Wolff, former assistant administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The result: a new generation of monitoring devices, such as Doppler radar, that can help predict wind-shear and tornadoes. &quot;There has been a real revolution in measuring techniques, and there is a coming revolution in what you do with those measurements,&quot; says John Firor of the National Center for Atmospheric Research.    Long-range forecasting, still technically immature, and climate research get more attention. Companies are looking at the greenhouse effect &quot;to figure out how to profit from it or at least mitigate its effects,&quot; says Robert Bunting of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. Pennsylvania State University and others set up interdisciplinary earth science centers to study the problem.    Major players in forecasting equipment, such as Control Data Corp., see &quot;whole new markets opening up&quot; as research progresses.    A SEWER SYMBOL: Alligators flushed down the toilet, the story goes, thrive in New York sewers. Now the city is cashing in on the myth. A $7 T-shirt sold by the city's department of environmental protection proclaims &quot;The Legend Lives.&quot; The graphic: an alligator crawling out of a manhole.    IF YOUR FOOD MOVES, take it to a doctor, warns a letter in the Journal of the American Medical Association. A housewife who had cooked haddock in the microwave saw it move while cooling on the kitchen table. It was found to contain parasitic worms, the letter said.    JAPANESE WEDDINGS are on the rise at the Hyatt Regency in Vancouver, Canada, due to favorable exchange rates and the expense of such fetes in Japan. Now doing a wedding a month, the hotel plans to market packages that include Japanese bridal-dress rental and a Buddhist priest.    PHONE MAIL takes hold at companies, and its uses are spreading.    Machines are answering the phone at a growing number of U.S. companies, forcing callers to leave taped messages or punch in additional numbers to talk with a human. At Enron Corp. in Houston, personnel cuts prompted phone-mail service. &quot;It really comes in handy when you don't have that many secretaries,&quot; says Enron's Debbie Akerman. Lotus Development Corp., Cambridge, Mass., says the systems make people reachable in today's mobile society.    Sales of phone-mail systems -- which cost from $20,000 to more than $100,000 -- &quot;easily&quot; are doubling every three or four years, says Bob Lerner of Wang Laboratories Inc., Lowell, Mass. More people are becoming comfortable speaking to a machine, explains Deepak Kamlani of Votrax Inc., Troy, Mich. Coming uses: systems that let students call in for their grades or let aviators call ahead for weather information, he says.    Enron took out its credit department's system, saying employees were screening -- and not returning -- calls.    BRIEFS: My Own Meals Inc., Deerfield, Ill., markets five nutritionally balanced entrees for kids ages two to eight. . . . Doghouses designed by architecture students at the State University of New York at Buffalo include a Victorian cottage and a castle. </TEXT></DOC>
