Letthere be no doubt about that,'' said Khaled Nasser Zaferi, 27, aKuwaiti security man, who was held captive during the 16-day ordeal.   He said a group of men boarded the plane after it landed atMashhad Airport in Iran on April 5 with 112 people on board.   ``More terrorists boarded the plane at Mashhad where theyproduced a submachine gun and explosives they didn't have before,''he told The Associated Press in an interview at his home.   They were disguised as cleaning workers, Zaferi said, ``buttheir performance was so bad and unprofessional that most of uswhispered to each other, `These must be Iranian security men.'''   Zaferi, 21 other passengers and seven crew members arrived homefrom Algiers Thursday, one day after they were freed by thehijackers at Houari Boumedienne Airport.   The hostages included three cousins of the emir of Kuwait.   Kuwait Airways Flight 422 was commandeered on a flight fromBangkok, Thailand, to Kuwait. It stopped first in Mashhad where 57hostages were freed. It then went to Larnaca, Cyprus, where 13 morewere released and two hostages were killed.   The plane flew next to Algiers, Algeria, where one hostage wasreleased due to medical problems.   On Wednesday, the 31 remaining captives were freed, and 29 flewto Kuwait.   The hostages had demanded the release of 17 convicted terroristsjailed for bombing the U.S. and French embassies in Kuwait in 1983,but Kuwait had refused to do so.   Another captive, Khaled Shamari, 32, also a businessman, saidgumnen boarded the plane in Iran.   ``They brought arms and explosives aboard the aircraft,'' hesaid. ``They also brought the plastic straps with which they tiedour hands.''   All the hostages said they did not know that two men had beenkilled in Cyprus. They said the two were taken to the front of theaircraft and then disappeared.   The exact deal that ended the ordeal in Algeria is not known.But Arab diplomats have said the hostges slipped away aftersurrendering the Boeing 747 and the remaining captives Wednesday.   Western diplomats have said the hijackers went to Beirut. Butofficials at Beirut airport denied they landed there.   Friday's edition of The New York Times quoted unidentified Arabofficials as saying the hijackers were flown on a private Algerianjet to Damascus, Syria, and were believed to have traveled overlandto Lebanon.   The officials also were quoted as saying that, with theexception of one Iranian, most of the hijackers were thought to beLebanese citizens.   Zaferi said he knew that the men who boarded the plane where notcleaning workers, ``because I'm an airport security man myself.   ``But of course I never revealed my real profession to thehijackers. I told them I am a public relations employee,'' he said.   He said that at the start of the hijacking, a Kuwaiti passengernext to him, Mubarak Sawagh, murmured ``God help me. I don't thinkI'll survive it this time ... This is the second time that I endurethis experience.''   Sawagh was aboard a Kuwait Airways jetliner that was hijacked toTehran in December 1984 by sky pirates who also demanded therelease of the terrorists jailed in Kuwait.   The hijackers killed two American hostages before the Iraniansstormed the plane.   Zaferi said the hijackers more pillow cases as masks. They alsomoved the passengers around every few hours.   He said they spoke in several dialects, apparently to covertheir real identity. But, Zaferi added, ``I'm certain they were allLebanese.''   Shamari said: ``It was very obvious to us that the hijackersbecame tense and savage after leaving Mashad.   ``The hijackers wired the explosives to the doors of theaircraft after landing in Larnaca,'' he said. ``We felt our doomwas sealed.''   The former captives said they learned they would be freedsuddenly.   ``The Algerians told us to cheer up because our ordeal wasover,'' Shamari said. ``About half an hour later, we were asked toleave the plane.''   Kuwait and other Arab countries praised Algeria for achievingfreedom for the hostages without additional violence. But theUnited States, Britain and other Western powers criticized Algeriafor allowing the hijackers to get away.</TEXT></DOC>
