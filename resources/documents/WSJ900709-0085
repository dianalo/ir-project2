Deliveries under the order, which Seattle-based Boeingdescribed as its third-largest ever when options areincluded, will begin in 1992 and would stretch through 1999.In London, British Airways Chairman Lord King said theairline's biggest order ever &quot;will ensure that we have asufficient flow of 747-400 aircraft to meet the growth of ourintercontinental network&quot; forecast for the 1990s and beyond.</LP><TEXT>   The firm order for 21 of the 386-passenger, long-rangeplanes -- plus British Airways' conversion of two options tofirm orders late last year -- would boost the airline's747-400 fleet to 42, larger than that of any other carrier,Boeing said. The planes will be powered by Rolls RoyceRB211524G engines. In 1986, British Airways ordered 19 of thejetliners and took options for 12 more, including the twothat were converted to firm orders in December. The remaining10 options are still outstanding. Were all its optionsconverted, the British Airways 747-400 fleet could swell to64 by the end of the decade. British Airways already hastaken delivery of 13 747-400s from that 1986 order.   British Airways said it had negotiated the right toconvert the 747-400s it ordered into any new variant of theaircraft that Boeing might develop in the 1990s.   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,Boeing stock closed at $60.50, up $1.25 a share. BritishAirways shares traded late Friday on London's Stock Exchangeat 211 pence, up 2 from Thursday.   A spokeswoman for the airline confirmed it also is talkingwith Boeing about a possible purchase of the aerospaceconcern's proposed 767-X airliner, a new 350-seat plane ithopes to launch as the 777. The spokeswoman said BritishAirways also is talking with McDonnell Douglas Corp. aboutits MD-11 aircraft and to European aircraft maker AirbusIndustrie about its A-330, which are much further along inthe development process.   &quot;All three options are being studied. All three are incontention,&quot; she said, adding that the airline expects tochoose &quot;very late&quot; this year. She declined to say how many ofthose planes British Airways plans to order.   The 747-400 order brings Boeing's total orders so far thisyear to 242 aircraft valued at $22.7 billion, the companysaid. Last year at this time, the company had orders for 602aircraft valued at $33.2 billion.   Separately, Boeing said it expects to reduce its workforce in the state of Washington by about 2,700 during thesecond half of the year, making the total 1990 reductionabout 5,600. Such a reduction would exceed by 600 the size ofthe employment decline that Boeing had projected in January.Reductions generally are related to a lower volume ofmilitary work, Boeing said.</TEXT></DOC>
