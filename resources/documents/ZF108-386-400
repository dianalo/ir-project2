 This column marks the46th &quot;In Practice&quot; I've written for AI EXPERT, and if I've learned one thingin all that time, it's that often questions are as important as answers.andP;  Sothanks for asking.andM;Recently, I asked Philip Chapnick, the esteemed editor of AI EXPERT, tocontribute an editorial to my AI Trends newsletter on the state of theneural-networks business.andP;  Philip handled this request with grand aplomb, andin the course of discussing his contribution, I discovered some worthwhileneural-network applications to discuss in this column.andM;Now, I've been known to pooh-pooh some of the pursuits of the neural-netcommunity in AI EXPERT and other magazines.andP;  I just don't think that neuralnets are ready for the mass market; too many people have too many hopes.andP;  Forthis reason, I've enjoyed comparing neural-net systems to Elvis's brain.andP;  Imean, people want to believe that Elvis is alive so badly, they'll stake out7-Elevens from here to Hanoi in hopes of seeing the guy.andP;  Even in hisSnickers-addled final days, Elvis could outperform neural nets with bothrefrigerators tied behind his back.andM;What it boils down to is this: Elvis was commercialization at its finest, andneural nets haven't even begun to scratch the surface of potentialapplication areas.andP;  Not to say, however, that neural nets aren't being usedin some very intriguing problem areas: they are, indeed.andP;  And as I think thefollowing applications show, niches where neural nets can be put to excellentuse do exist.andP;  However, I don't think our national-defense system, or evenmundane applications such as word processors, should be based on them.andM;The U.S.andP;  Dept.andP;  of Defense is extremely interested in neural nets andprobably the technology's biggest investor.andP;  Let's submerge into our firstapplication, shall we?andP;  NeuralWare, a neural-network software developer inPittsburgh, Pa., sells the NeuralWorks Professional II package, which itclaims is the most widely used neural-network development tool in thecountry.andP;  One NeuralWorks user is Raytheon, the electronics and defensecontracting firm.andP;  Raytheon is developing products for antisubmarine warfare.andM;By way of metaphor, hunting submarines is a lot more difficult than finding aneedle in a haystack.andP;  For one, the needle keeps moving.andP;  For another, thehaystack tends to be a few miles deep and hundreds of miles wide.andP;  Andlastly, the needle often knows you're looking for it and may choose to hidein various nooks and crannies scattered throughout the haystack.andP;  Withoutactually drawing you a diagram, I think you get the picture.andM;Part of sub-seeking is based on the gathering and analyzing of data fromsonar and other signal-capturing equipment.andP;  It involves tracking a specificobject believed to be a submarine, but, since the object can't be seen,determinations have to be made from the signal processing and data analysis.andO;Based on the amount of data collected by these computerized systems, tryingto figure out just where a sub may be, what class it is, how fast it'smoving, and ultimately whether it's a sub at all and not just a slow-movingschool of fish, is more than a daunting task.andM;Raytheon has developed a NeuralWorks system to perform feature analysis onthe collected signal data.andP;  The system evaluates all the information andattempts to recognize patterns or specific features in the signals.andP;  (In myopinion, pattern recognition is the single best area for the application ofneural nets.)andP;  Over a continuous period of time, the network may analyzeenough information to provide specific details about the monitored object:whether the target is indeed a submarine, its location, and even its type orclass (crucial for identifying whether the craft is friend, foe, or neutral).andO;Raytheon says NeutralWorks has become its most important tool ininvestigating network paradigms in ASW environments.andM;Continuing the theme of detection and warfare, as well as capitalizing onlast month's topic of air travel, we're going to take a stroll through thosemetal detectors at airports that are supposed to help keep weapons offairplanes.andP;  (You know, the ones that sound an alarm when you're carrying moremetal on you than is contained in a nickel.)andP;  SAIC, of San Diego, Calif., aleading player in neural nets and a defense contractor to boot, developed asystem that has been deployed at several airports around the world.andP;  Thisbomb-detection device, known as SNOOPE, uses a neural-net system called athermal neutron-activation module to detect the presence of certain compoundsin baggage.andP;  This type of &quot;sniffer&quot; system determines chemical configurationsfrom certain materials.andP;  For instance, the neural net can determine thedifference between a bomb and a bottle of tonic water by its nitrogencontent.andM;Installed by TWA at its terminal in JFK Airport, SNOOPE has been running forabout three months and has processed tons of baggage that pass through thethermal neutron-activation module.andP;  SNOOPE is one of the first commerciallydeployed neural-net applications in any environment, and it may find a homein more and more airports as security tightens in accordance with new safetyguidelines.andM;Aside from the military and detection businesses, the medical field has foundsome interesting uses for neural nets.andP;  This fact may not be very surprisingconsidering the biological basis for neural-net concepts; anyway, themedical-research community seems to have become enamored of variouscommercial packages (such as HNC's Explore Net and NeuralWare's NeuralWorks).andO;The University of Pittsburgh has been developing an application to assist inthe diagnosis of brain and eye disorders.andM;The neural net addresses a commonly used medical exam called the Visual FieldTest (VFT).andP;  Simply put, this test determines what patients can see withinthe scope of their field of vision (including peripheral vision) and the sizeof that field.andP;  Disorders can arise from disease, weak muscles, congenitaleye dysfunction, and the like -- disorders that affect the range, clarity,and breadth of vision.andP;  If the disorder is extreme, it may be the result ofbrain or nerve damage.andM;Results are recorded based on the patient's visual reaction to specific tests(observing an object moving between two points, for instance).andP;  Then theresults are analyzed by the physician, who determines the cause of thedisorder based on the cumulative results.andM;In diagnosing the eye, however, several interpretations can result.andP;  Becauseof the vast complexity of the eye and its connection to the brain, hundredsof potential causes for some types of disorders are possible.andP;  And, in such alarge grouping, different disorders may have the same symptoms orappearances.andP;  Because the eye is so complex and its function so intricatelytied to the brain, eye and brain disorders can create similar problems.andM;It takes the skill of trained opthalmologists and neurologists to interpretthis data accurately and make a diagnosis.andP;  These doctors are trained todistinguish between pattern similarity in tests and arrive at more preciseresults.andP;  The Pitt medical school is training NeuralWorks to review theresults of VFTs and recognize the characteristic patterns of certain visualdefects, especially rare or obscure ones.andP;  Based on its determination, thesystem will also be able to forecast the long-term effects of a disorderbased on the patient's current VFTs.andP;  The university would also like toextend the program until it could explain its diagnosis by expounding upondetails of each contributing VFT factor.andM;The neural-net business continues to promote its abilities for financialservices in applications such as economic forecasting, stockmarket trendanalysis, portfolio management, and a score of other money-based areas.andP;  Oneof the companies that's been interested in this area for some time is bancTecof Silver Springs, Md.andP;  Starting its neural work with Nestor and thenswitching to HNC, BancTec is working with an optical character-recognitionsystem that assists in scanning bank-check signatures.andP;  This system is usedto verify that checks match the amounts of the bills being remitted.andP;  Thisprocess is very time-intensive because it usually requires a human to matchcheck-to-bill for verification.andM;Using HNC's Image Document Entry Processing Terminal (IDEPT), the check isdigitally scanned into a computer system and the amount of the check--in thesignator's handwriting--is determined by the neural net.andP;  This task isespecially difficult for several reasons: check backgrounds vary greatly,numerical amounts are entered differently by different individuals, and mostpeople's handwriting doesn't conform to the Palmer Penmanship method taughtat fine grammar schools in the 1950s and 1960s.andP;  Nevertheless, BancTec ispleased with the system's results and is further investigating ways ofdeploying it to minimize human check verification.andM;THE ENVELOPE, PLEASEandM;So there you have it: neural nets in the real world.andP;  Most of these systemswork on some form of pattern matching, and you can expect that neural netswill continue to be used in this way for the next few years.andP;  Until they cantell the difference between a Musketeers bar and a Milky Way, though, Elviswill continue to make more money than most of the neural-net vendors.andM;And speaking of commercialization, I'd like to take this opportunity toannounce my plans for creating an award for the company that most promotesthe use of intelligent systems in the commercial marketplace.andP;  Candidatescould be either vendors or users, as long as the company has demonstrated thebenefits of putting AI into practice in the real world.andP;  I'm planning aDecember announcement, so start contemplating your entries now.andP;  The winnerwill receive a very artsy-type plaque to commemorate the award.andP;  (I'll giveyou more details in next month's column.)andP;  In the meantime, my own neural-netsystem is beckoning me to other pursuits.andP;  One thing that can be said forartificial neural nets over real ones: at least you can't kill them with awell-mixed margarita.andM;Harvey P.
