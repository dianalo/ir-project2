Mr. McMahon's support is a major boost for Mr. Gates,whose credibility with lawmakers suffers as a result of hisperformance as deputy director during the Iran-Contra scandalin 1986. &quot;It's very plausible that Gates didn't know what wasgoing on,&quot; said Mr. McMahon, who had held the same post underDirector William Casey. &quot;I think he's pretty clean on this.I'm going to push for Gates.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Among major CIA veterans, few have the same standing inCongress as Mr. McMahon, who preserved close ties with seniorlawmakers even as he served in the stormy period of covertaction in the early 1980s. His forceful image presents astriking contrast to Mr. Gates's failure to more aggressivelypursue warnings of the Iran-Contra operation.   Mr. McMahon defends Mr. Gates in large part because theIran-Contra operation was run more from the White House thanfrom the CIA. But his broader account of the deputy's job isat odds with those who now argue that Mr. Casey socompartmentalized information that he prevented his deputiesfrom knowing what was going on in the agency.   A former special assistant to Mr. Casey, now postedoverseas by the CIA, has been interviewed by the SenateIntelligence Committee in regard to Mr. Casey'sadministrative style. But Mr. McMahon said again yesterday:&quot;We had a swinging door between us. I knew everything Iwanted to know.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
