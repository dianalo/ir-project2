The individual petitions are describedbelow, including the party seeking relief, the regulatory provisions involved,and the nature of the relief being requested. The individual petitions seeking an approval or exemption are as follows:<ITAG tagnum="84">National Railroad Passenger Corporation </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">[</ITAG><T3>General Docket Number RST-88-1</T3>]The National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) has submitted a requestfor a special approval under 49 CFR 213.9(c), which states in part, ``Maximumoperating speed may not exceed 110 mph without prior approval of the FederalRailroad Administrator.'' Amtrak requests approval to operate convertedCapitoliner passenger cars in a push-pull mode at 125 mph between Washington,DC and New York City, New York. The Capitoliner cars were converted frommultiple-unit (MU) Metroliner motive powered cars to non-motive poweredcars with an operating cab at one end. The propelling motors have beenremoved; however, the pantographs will be utilized to draw power from theoverhead catenary wire for the electrically operated equipment for eachindividual car. This conversion makes it possible for Amtrak to operateCapitoliner cars in trains hauled by electric locomotives in both the pushand pull mode over electrified sections of the railroad. In June of 1987, braking and ride quality tests of the Capitoliner carswere successfully completed at speeds up to 125 mph. The tests were madewhile the train was in both the push and pull mode with electric locomotivesand a diesel electric locomotive. Based on the results of those tests,Amtrak is requesting a special approval under 49 CFR 213.9(c) to operatethe Capitoliner cars in revenue service, in the push-pull mode, at speedsup to 125 mph, on the Northeast Corridor between Washington, DC and NewYork City, New York. <ITAG tagnum="84">Union Pacific Railroad Company </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">[</ITAG><T3>Waiver Petition Docket Number PB-88-1</T3>]The Union Pacific Railroad Company (UP) requests a waiver of compliancewith certain provisions of the railroad power brakes regulation (49 CFRPart 232). the UP seeks a waiver of compliance with andSection;232.12(b),which stipulates, ``Each carrier shall designate additional inspectionpoints not more than 1,000 miles apart where intermediate inspection willbe made to determine that_ 1. Brake pipe leakage does not exceed five pounds per minute; 2. Brakes apply on each car in response to a 20-pound service brake pipepressure reduction; and 3. Brake rigging is properly secured and does not bind or foul.'' The UP request for relief is for only the double stack unit trains operatingthe West Coast to Chicago, Illinois, and return. It proposes to performa single intermediate train air brake test at Rawlins, Wyoming, a distanceof 1,126 miles from Los Angeles, California; 1,092 miles from Portland,Oregon; 1,269 miles from Oakland, California; 1,232 miles from Tacoma,Washington; 1,270 miles from Seattle, Washington; and 1,137 miles fromChicago, Illinois. At the present time the UP is performing the requiredintermediate tests at two locations, Salt Lake City, Utah and North Platte,Nebraska, to comply with the Federal regulation. The railroad states the change is necessary to meet its customers' requirementsconcerning delivery and time schedules. It refers to the Association ofAmerican Railroads' (AAR) long distance train tests made in 1981 and 1985.An analysis of those test results showed that composition brake shoes,which are standard on the double stack cars, wear slightly more than \1/32\of an inch per 1,000 miles. Brake piston travel increase averaged lessthan 0.2-inch per trip for all trains tested. <ITAG tagnum="84">Norfolk Southern Corporation </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">[</ITAG><T3>Waiver Petition Docket Number PB-87-2</T3>]On behalf of its operating subsidiaries, the Norfolk Southern Corporation(NS) requests a waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the railroadpower brakes regulation (49 CFR Part 232). The NS seeks a waiver of thecompliance with andSection;232.12(b), which stipulates, ``Each carrier shalldesignate additional inspection points not more than 1,000 miles apartwhere intermediate inspection will be made to determine that: 1. Brake pipe leakage does not exceed five pounds per minute; 2. Brakes apply on each car in response to a 20-pound service brake pipepressure reduction; and 3. Brake rigging is properly secured and does not bind or foul.'' The NS request for relief is for a unit coal train operation between Marrowbonecoal mine (near Williamson, West Virginia) and Sherrer, Georgia, a roundtripof 1,168 miles. At the present time the NS is (1) performing an initialterminal train air brake test at Knoxville, Tennessee (located betweenMarrowbone and Sherrer) before the empty train departs for the loadingsite at the Marrowbone coal mine and (2) a 1,000-mile intermediate trainair brake test also at Knoxville before the loaded train departs for theGeorgia Power Company plant at Sherrer, Georgia. Knoxville, Tennessee isthe designated maintenance point for the motive power and rapid-dump hoppercars in the Marrowbone-Sherrer service, according to the NS. It statesthat the train receives a particularly thorough initial terminal inspectionin order to insure that the cars' bottom door operating mechanisms, airbrakes, drawgear and running gear are in proper condition for the unittrain to maintain its scheduled operating cycle of 72 hours between mineand power plant without equipment-related delays. In addition, the NS schedules10 cars for removal from the train on a rotating basis for preventive maintenanceat the Knoxville car repair shop.The NS states that the intermediate air brake test made at Knoxville onthe train's southbound trip is performed solely in order to comply withandSection; 232.12(b). The NS contends that the inspection and maintenanceprogram for the train keeps the brake systems on the cars in excellentcondition to perform properly during the full cycle of 1,168 miles afteran initial terminal train air brake test at Knoxville. The railroad isof the opinion that a waiver of the ``1,000 mile'' intermediate train airbrake test required by andSection; 232.12(b) would cause no adverse impactsor increased costs to the private sector, to consumers, or to Federal,State or local governments.<ITAG tagnum="84">Napa Valley Railroad Company</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">[</ITAG><T3>Waiver Petition Docket Number SA-88-1</T3>]The Napa Valley Railroad Company (NVR) requests a waiver of compliancewith certain provisions of the Railroad Safety Appliance Standards (49CFR Part 231) for its locomotive number NVR 50. The NVR seeks a waiverof compliance with those provisions of andSection; 231.30, ``Locomotive usedin switching service,'' that require that each locomotive used in switchingservice be equipped with four side switching steps, with uncoupling leversthat can be operated from the steps, and with side vertical handholds.This recently acquired locomotive is a 44-ton industrial switcher typelocomotive rated at 380 horsepower that was built by the General ElectricCompany in 1941. This locomotive was formerly owned by the Camino, Placervilleand Lake Tahoe Railroad Company and was numbered 102. That railroad wasgranted a waiver (Docket Number SA-79-7) to operate the 102 without therequired side switching steps (andSection; 231.30(c)), wide vertical handholds(andSection; 230.30(e)) and uncoupling mechanisms (section 230(f)), basedupon its geographical location and operating environments. The NVR hasrenumbered the locomotive as NVR 50.The NVR is requesting the same kind of waiver for this locomotive basedupon the fact that it will be operated primarily on its own trackage betweenNapa, California and St. Helena, California, a distance of approximately21 miles. The locomotive will be used occasionally in interchange freightservice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Border Pacific Railroad</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">[</ITAG><T3>Waiver Petition Docket Numbers RSGM-88-7 and LI-88-2</T3>]The Border Pacific Railroad Company requests a waiver of compliance withcertain provisions of the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) safetystandards 49 CFR Part 223 (Safety Glazing Standards) and 49 CFR Part 229(Locomotive Safety Standards) for its locomotive number BOP 50. The BorderPacific Railroad is a Class III short-line railroad located in south Texas.The railroad seeks a waiver of the FRA's requirements (1) for certifiedglazing of locomotive windshields pursuant to andSection; 223.11 (DocketNumber RSGM-88-7) and (2) for welded wheels pursuant to andSection; 229.75(m)(Docket Number LI-88-2).The Border Pacific Railroad line is 31 miles long and operates througha remote area of south Texas between Rio Grande City (at the United Statesand Mexican border) and Misison, Texas. The largest city through whichthe railroad operates has a population of 10,000 people. The carrier statesthat it has never experienced any problems with vandalism or objects beingthrown at the locomotive. The maximum permitted speed is 10 mph, and nopassengers are carried on its line. In 1987, a total of 327 cars were moved,and none contained hazardous materials. The railroad interchanges withthe Missouri Pacific Railroad at a minor location. Section 223.11(a)-(c)requires certified safety glazing for locomotives. The glazing presentlyinstalled on locomotive BOP 50 does not comply with those regulations.The Border Pacific Railroad believes that the existing windshield is morethan adequate to meet safety concerns relative to its operational and geographicalenvironment. Further, it would cost the railroad several thousand dollarsto replace the windshield.The Border Pacific Railroad seeks a waiver of compliance with those provisionsof andSection; 229.75(m) that prohibit the use of welded wheels. The regulationprovides in pertinent part as follows:Fusion welding may not be used on tires or steel wheels of locomotives,except for the repair of flat spots and worn flanges on locomotives usedexclusively in yard service. A wheel that has been welded is a welded wheelfor the life of the wheel.The Border Pacific Railroad states that after several years of use, thelocomotive wheels were required to be recontoured in order for them tohave the necessary width at the flange. Although the length of the flangeswas in compliance with FRA regulations, in an abundance of caution, thecarrier decided to lengthen the flanges of three wheels so as to maintainan even higher level of safety. It was brought to the carrier's attentionby a Federal inspector that fusion welding is not permitted on wheels oflocomotives used in other than yard service and that its locomotive wasbeing used in road service. The carrier states that it feels a waiver ofandSection; 229.75(m) should be granted for the continued use of its locomotivewith welded flanges, given the operating and geographical situation.The Border Pacific Railroad also states it would cost $10,000 to replacethe welded wheels. It submits that a grant of this waiver would resultin an equivalent level of safety as required by the existing regulation.Interested parties are invited to participate in these proceedings by submittingwritten views, data, or comments. FRA does not anticipate scheduling apublic hearing in connection with these proceedings since the facts donot appear to warrant a hearing. If any interested party desires an opportunityfor oral comment, they should notify FRA, before the end of the commentperiod and specify the basis for their request.All communications concerning these proceedings should identify the appropriatedocket number (e.g., Waiver Petition Docket Number LI-88-2) and must besubmitted in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Office of Chief Counsel, FederalRailroad Administration, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington,DC 20590. Communications received before September 16, 1988, will be consideredby FRA before final action is taken. Comments received after that datewill be considered as far as practicable. All written communications concerningthese proceedings are available for examination during regular businesshours (9 a.m.-5 p.m.) in Room 8201, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh StreetSW., Washington, DC 20590.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, July 26, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">J.W.
