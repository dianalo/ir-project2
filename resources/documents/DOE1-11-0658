Low dose contrast medium (5 ml, 280 mgI/mlMetrizamide) was injected into the common femoral artery using a 21Gtheath needle or a 4F thin wall catheter. Although all cases had severestenosis or occlusion of the superficial femoral artery, in 96 % of thesecases, only 5 ml contrast medium can allow visualization of fine vesselsof the foot.</TEXT></DOC>
