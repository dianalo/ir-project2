Iran's president headed for the front lines andcalled on his countrymen to join him in ``divine duty.''   Also Sunday, a four-man U.N. team arrived in Tehran to discussprisoners of war. A second U.N. team is expected to arrive in theIranian capital within the next few days to work out details of acease-fire.   Iran's foreign minister said the Iraqi offensives threatened acease-fire.   The official Iraqi News Agency announced that Iraq's incursionin the southern war front, which began Friday, was over and thatIraqi troops had withdrawn.   Iran said Saturday that Iraqi troops backed by tanks, warplanesand chemical weapons thrust nearly 40 miles into Iranian territory.The official Islamic Republic News Agency said Sunday the attackhad been repulsed with 9,000 Iraqi dead and wounded.   Iranian President Ali Khamenei called his people to action in amessage broadcast on Tehran radio.   ``Now that the Iraqi troops have stepped on the Islamicterritory of Iran, no response except that of weapons ispermissible,'' Khamenei said in the message, which was monitored inNicosia.   ``The nation must rush to the assistance of the armed forces,''Khamenei said, adding that he ``will take my worthless body andlife to the front of justice and present myself for divine duty.''   As Khamenei headed for the front lines, Iranian Foreign MinisterAli Akhbar Velayati left for New York to meet with U.N.Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.   Velayati said he had sent Perez de Cuellar a letter saying Iraqimilitary action threatened a cease-fire and calling for the UnitedNations to take ``timely and preventive action,'' Tehran radio said.   The U.N. chief has invited Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz toNew York for peace talks.   Interviewed Sunday on ABC's ``This Week with David Brinkley,''Perez de Cuellar said he hoped hostilities would cease when hebegan discussions with the two leaders.   ``Until there is a cease-fire, I cannot complain,'' thesecretary-general said. ``The only thing which I have done ... isto make an appeal to both sides to exert restraint. And I hope, ofcourse, that when ... I start my discussion with the parties, Ithink there will not be military activities in the area.''   Asked if upcoming Iran-Iraq peace talks would be heldface-to-face, Perez de Cuellar said: ``My idea is to discussseparately with both sides. Of course, I will be only too pleasedif, at some stage, I could have the two sides together.''   Iraq wants to hold direct negotiations. Iran refused but laterindicated it might agree to them at Perez de Cuellar's request.   In the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, the state-run daily Ath-Thawrasaid Iraq has ``no greedy intentions on Iranian territory and doesnot want to humiliate the Iranian people.''   The article, quoted by the Iraqi News Agency, said Iraq'smilitary actions following Iran's acceptance of the U.N. cease-fireresolution last week were designed to recapture Iraqi territory totake ``as many prisoners of war as possible.''   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has said taking a large number ofprisoners would help in peace negotiations.   Iraq accepted the resolution, which calls for return to previousborders and a prisoner exchange, when it passed a year ago.   Iraq claims it captured 8,636 prisoners of war in its incursionFriday and Saturday.   According to International Red Cross figures, Iran has about50,000 Iraqi POW's and Iraq held 13,000 Iranian soldiers before thelatest raid.   IRNA said the Iranian Cabinet met Sunday and praised the Iranianpeople for heeding the call to join soldiers at the battlefronts.   The Cabinet announced that on August 2, a Moslem holy day inIran, mass rallies would be held by Iranians ``to reaffirm theirallegiance to Imam (Ayatollah Ruhollah) Khomeini.   Iraq said its aircraft flew 148 combat missions inside Iran onSunday and that two planes crashed in Iranian territory. Iran saidthe two jets were shot down.   The Iraqi communique said helicopter gunships carried out 217combat sorties ``inflicting important losses on enemy men, weaponryand equipment.''   It said four Iranian soldiers were killed in other minor action.   The Iranian agency said the border town of Karand-e-Gharb in theBakhtaran province was hit by ``cluster bombs'' and seven civilianswere killed. Iraq denied the claim.</TEXT></DOC>
