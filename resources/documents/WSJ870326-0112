The government estimated that the program, to take effect April 1, will cost $350 million (Canadian) a year and generate about $1 billion in new exploration and development. The program will provide companies with cash grants equal to a third of their exploration and development expenses, to a maximum $10 million of spending per company per year. Thus, the maximum annual grant to a company would be $3.3 million.    &quot;The program will provide an immediate boost to the industry in western Canada,&quot; said Robert Andrews, president of the Independent Producers' Association of Canada, which represents mostly small and medium-sized oil and gas companies. He said the program mainly would help small producers because of its ceiling on eligible expenses.    The government's move was welcomed in western Canada, which has been calling for federal assistance for the petroleum industry. Alberta, where most exploration takes place, has an unemployment rate of 10.9% compared with a national average of 9.6%. Mr. Andrews said that without the new program, the industry projected conventional oil and gas investment at $3 billion for 1987, down from $10 billion two years ago. But he said with the new program, spending might exceed $4 billion this year.    Political analysts said the move also is designed to strengthen the standing of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservative government in western Canada. Neil Webber, Alberta's provincial Energy Minister, said he was &quot;very happy&quot; with the federal incentive program and noted that the latest public-opinion poll &quot;certainly didn't hurt.&quot; The poll showed the Conservatives slightly trailing the opposition Liberal and New Democratic parties in Edmonton, Alberta, a traditional Tory stronghold.    Federal Energy Minister Marcel Masse said the government decided on grants, rather than tax benefits the industry sought, because grants would benefit immediately the many small companies that are unprofitable and thus aren't paying taxes.    Hans Maciej, technical director of the Canadian Petroleum Association, said large companies wouldn't benefit much from the program because of the low limit on spending eligible for grants. The association represents the big, integrated oil companies, and its members account for 97% of Canada's oil and gas production. He said major companies hope the government will provide them with new fiscal incentives when it introduces its planned tax reforms this spring.    The government is studying the feasibility of assisting large projects including development of the Hibernia oil field off the coast of Newfoundland. The government 10 days ago made a revised offer of incentives to the Hibernia consortium, which is headed by Mobil Corp.'s Canadian subsidiary. Details of the proposal weren't disclosed. An earlier offer by the government to the consortium was turned down. </TEXT></DOC>
