The petitioners said they were reluctant to file thecomplaint because of the sensitivity of U.S.-Soviet relationsand the precarious state of the Soviet economy. &quot;Everybody isconcerned about the economic plight of the Soviet people,&quot;said Michael McMurphy, president of the Uranium Producers ofAmerica, in a statement. But he said the &quot;devastating&quot; effectof the Soviet shipments on the U.S. industry compelled thegroup's members to file the petition.</LP><TEXT>   The complaint alleges that Soviet uranium is being sold inthe U.S. well below its presumed home-market prices orproduction costs. The U.S. producers asked the department toimpose duties of 132% to 160% on the Soviet uranium shipmentsto offset the alleged unfair price advantage. Theprice-depressing effect of these shipments caused U.S.producers to lose $15.8 million in revenue in 1990, thecomplaint said. The group estimated that it could causelosses of $49.9 million in 1991 and $40.3 million in 1992.The Commerce Department has 20 days to decide whether toinitiate an investigation of the complaint.</TEXT></DOC>
