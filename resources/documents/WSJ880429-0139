Damage awards under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act could put a serious dent in the capital of accounting firms, accountants and lawyers say. And the profession's problem is compounded because RICO damage awards aren't covered by malpractice insurance.    Two months ago, Philadelphia-based Laventhol andamp; Horwath became the first big accounting firm to be found guilty of a RICO charge. A jury in a Sacramento, Calif., federal court decided in favor of 2,850 investors who lost a total of more than $20 million in a failed tax-shelter program audited by Laventhol.    A settlement on the damage award could be announced as early as today. Lawyers familiar with the case expect that Laventhol will pay at least $10 million.    In addition, a federal judge in New York recently held that claims for as much as $260 million against Chicago-based Arthur Andersen andamp; Co. can stay in a suit against the biggest U.S. accounting firm. In the case, the British government alleges that Andersen's audits from 1978 to 1981 of De Lorean Motor Co.'s Irish unit, which collapsed, were shoddy. Andersen, which sought to have the RICO charges dropped, denies the charge.    &quot;The accounting profession is very worried about its future, and rightly so,&quot; says Philip A. Lacovara, a partner of Hughes Hubbard andamp; Reed, a law firm that is lobbying Congress to soften certain RICO provisions. &quot;While there are currently $1 billion in malpractice claims against accountants, adding the RICO charges would bring the amount to $4 billion. This could put a big hole in the profession's capital.&quot;    Congress passed the RICO act 18 years ago to protect the competitors of businesses infiltrated by organized crime. The act provided for triple damage awards. The courts since have broadened the RICO concept to include any business that conspired over a period of time to commit a fraud. Accountants say this interpretation could undermine legitimate businesses that may have been negligent but didn't mean to commit serious crimes.    If RICO claims against accountants continue, &quot;there will soon be very few accounting firms that will want to audit public companies,&quot; warns George Bernstein, Laventhol's executive partner.    As RICO cases mount, Mr. Bernstein sees the number of accounting firms doing financial audit work &quot;squeezed down and audit fees going up, with the costs passed on to the public.&quot;    Accountants are lobbying to change the RICO law so that it would penalize only parties with criminal records. The Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to consider a bill in about two weeks that would impose triple damages in RICO cases only where small investors had losses or there was illegal insider trading.    The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, which has 260,000 members, is leading a battle to remove the small-investor provision. Its effort is being opposed by several consumer groups and the National Association of Attorneys General, made up of top state legal officials around the country.    The accountants' institute has hired two influential Washington law firms, Hughes Hubbard and Davis Polk Wardwell. Several years ago, the institute filed a brief in a Supreme Court case that sought to overturn the RICO act. But the high court ruled that Congress, not the courts, should be the one to alter the act.    Insurance companies that write professional liability policies say RICO claims against accountants have jumped in the past year. &quot;We now have about 50 such claims, compared with 20 about a year ago, while five years ago they were unheard of,&quot; says Dennis Bissett, an assistant vice president for Xerox Corp.'s Crum andamp; Forster insurance unit.    Because insurance companies won't cover RICO claims, these cases in some states &quot;have also put us in an adversarial relationship with accounting firms we cover against malpractice claims,&quot; Mr. Bissett says. In California, Texas and Florida, courts are directing insurers to hire attorneys to protect their own interests in RICO cases involving accounting firms. This, Mr. Bissett says, is raising insurers' costs &quot;and will surely help boost insurance liability rates.&quot;    An official of American International Group Inc.'s American Home Assurance Co. unit, which writes accountants' professional liability policies, says no insurance companies are covering RICO claims against accountants. He says claims &quot;are rising so quickly, we couldn't provide any malpractice coverage&quot; for certified public accountants &quot;if we had to backstop RICO.&quot;    Accounting firms say that without RICO coverage and with their malpractice deductibles -- the costs they have to bear themselves before insurance coverage begins -- rising to as much as $5 million recently, RICO could endanger the accounting profession's future.    Because all accounting firms are partnerships, with unlimited liability for each partner, &quot;with RICO hanging as a cloud over us, we aren't going to be able to attract the best and brightest college graduates to join our firms,&quot; says Charles Kaiser Jr., the nominee for vice chairman of the accounting institute.    Officials of the institute say that RICO claims aren't being made only against big firms. &quot;We have about a dozen RICO claims against local firms, and for firms that size, this can be quite alarming,&quot; Donald Schneeman, the institute's general counsel, says.    Dan Goldwasser, an attorney who consults for the New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants, says that when plaintiffs invoke RICO charges, &quot;it puts an enormous amount of pressure, even on small firms, to settle for more than they would have considered or can afford.&quot; Mr. Goldwasser says RICO is often invoked in &quot;frivolous&quot; claims because some attorneys believe that failing to invoke it could subject them to malpractice charges.    Barry S. Augenbraun, general counsel for Laventhol, says many juries in accountant liability cases may not be aware that triple damages are involved. &quot;This could be a free lunch for the plaintiffs' bar which should be stopped,&quot; he says.    Consumer groups charge that accountants want to get out from under RICO so they can escape punishment for permitting clients to issue financial statements that mislead investors.    &quot;RICO also is directed at securities boiler rooms, loan and travel agency scams and nursing home frauds,&quot; says Pamela Gilbert, a staff attorney for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group in Washington. &quot;Why eliminate protection for consumers just to help accountants, who've failed to prove to me they shouldn't be covered by RICO?&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
