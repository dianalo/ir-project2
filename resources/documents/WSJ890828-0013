The three thrifts, Heritage Savings andamp; Loan, Jerseyville, Ill., with $32.9 million in assets, Home Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, Mountain Home, Ark., with $46 million in assets, and Denton Savings Association, Denton, Texas, with $143 million in assets, were placed in receivership.    The RTC, established by the new savings and loan legislation to sell off failed thrifts, also placed in receivership five institutions that were taken over this year. The five are Broadview Savings Bank, Cleveland; Arrowhead Pacific Savings Bank, San Bernardino, Calif.; Gateway Savings Bank, San Francisco; Alpine Federal Savings andamp; Loan, Steamboat Springs, Colo.; and Valley Federal Savings andamp; Loan, Grand Junction, Colo.    The five thrifts had been in RTC conservatorship.    Most of the thrifts in the program are in conservatorship, in which daily operations are controlled by federal regulators but current owners and debtholders retain their interests pending further action. By putting institutions in receivership, regulators wipe out the interests of stockholders and any subordinated debtholders. All deposits up to $100,000 in the thrifts are guaranteed.    The thrifts are being taken over as part of President Bush's program to restructure the Sandamp;L industry. </TEXT></DOC>
