Following normal rule making procedures would havebeen unnecessary. The revisions to the regulations should have little orno economic impact and no adverse comments are expected concerning theterms of the revised regulation.Although this regulation is published as a final rule without prior notice,an opportunity for public comment is nevertheless desirable to ensure thatthe regulation is both reasonable and workable. Accordingly, persons wishingto comment may do so by submitting written comments to the office listedunder ``ADDRESS'' in this preamble. Commenters should include their namesand addresses, identify the docket number for the regulations, and givereasons for their comments. Based upon comments received, the regulationmay be changed.<ITAG tagnum="84"><T4>Drafting Information</T4></ITAG>The drafters of this regulation are Lieutenant Junior Grade M.M. Lauzon,project officer, Seventh Coast Guard District Aids to Navigation Branch,and Lieutenant Commander S.T. Fuger, Jr., project attorney, Seventh CoastGuard District Legal Office.<ITAG tagnum="84"><T4>Discussion of Regulation</T4></ITAG>The original rule was requested by the U.S. Navy to minimize the effectsof wakes on the drydock ARDM 1 OAKRIDGE, moored in King's Bay, Georgia,500 yards from the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway. Wakes cause vesselsinside the drydock to shift on their keelblocks. The regulation establisheda bare steerageway speed zone in the vicinity of King's Bay and CumberlandSound. The restriction eliminates a substantial hazard to workers causedby vessel movement in the drydock.The original Notice of Proposed Rule Making was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on May 17, 1984 (49 FR 20870), and the FinalRule became effective on December 10, 1984 (49 FR 44632, Nov. 8, 1984).This revision defines the boundaries of the zone in terms of latitude andlongitude. The original rule defined the boundaries by the positions ofspecific aids to navigation. However, the aids to navigation system inthe area has been changed, leaving the boundaries in the original ruleincorrectly stated. The geographic area of the zone defined by this ruleis the same as that defined by the original rule, except that the boundarypoint formerly defined by Lighted Buoy 45 has been slightly shifted tocoincide with the new configuration of the dredged waterway.Additionally, the title of the original rule did not specify the type ofregulation involved. This revision adds the words ``Regulated NavigationArea'' to the title.<ITAG tagnum="84">Economic Assessment and Certification:</ITAG>These regulations are considered to be non-major under Executive Order12291 on Federal Regulation and nonsignificant under Department of Transportationregulatory policies and procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). Theeconomic impact of this amendment has been found to be so minimal thatfurther evaluation is unnecessary. The Coast Guard certifies that thisrule, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on asubstantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism</ITAG>This rulemaking has been analyzed in accordance with the principles andcriteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determinedthat this rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications towarrant the preparation of a Federalism Statement.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 165</ITAG>Harbors, Marine safety, Navigation (water), Vessels, Waterways.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Regulation:</ITAG>In consideration of the foregoing, Part 165 of Title 33, Code of FederalRegulations, is amended as follows:1.
