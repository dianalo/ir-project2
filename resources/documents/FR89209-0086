The first proposed change would allow theClinton Power Station (CPS) to perform its first reactor refueling, inwhich new types of reactor fuel will be utilized, and to proceed with subsequentreactor operation with the reloaded core.The reload for Cycle 2 is generally a normal reload with no unusual corefeatures or characteristics. Proposed TS changes related to Maximum AveragePlanar Linear Heat Generation Rate (MAPLHGR) and Linear Heat GenerationRate (LHGR) limits for the new fuel, MAPLHGR and Minimum Critical PowerRation (MCPR) limits for all of the fuel using Cycle 2 core and transientparameters.The second proposed change would permit CPS operation in the maximum extendedoperating domain (MEOD) with (a) up to 50anddegrees;F reduction in feedwatertemperature and (b) elimination of APRM setdown.The MEOD includes expansion of the normal power/flow map into new regions.One region, which involves operation at rated power at lower than ratedcore flow rates, is called the extended load line region (ELLR). The otherregion, which involves operation at core flows at up to 107% of rated flowis called the increased core flow region (ICFR). Operation in the ELLRand ICFR permits greater operational flexibility and an improved unit capacityfactor.Reduced feedwater temperatures can arise from the inoperability or degradedperformance of individual feedwater heaters or string(s) of feedwater heatersor by deliberate reduction of feedwater heating.The third proposed change would revise the Romote Shutdown System Controlsto include additional control switches for valves 1E12-F068B and 1E12-F014Band circuit breaker 252A-T1AA1.Current operation of these components, when the normal control switch isinaccessible, requires them to be operated manually. The circuitry is thereforebeing modified to add control switches for these components. The additionof these control switches will enhance the operation of the Remote ShutdownSystem to the acceptable methods recognized by the NRC for satisfying GDC-19.The fourth proposed change consists of several changes to the surveillancerequirements for the jet pumps. One would allow present Surveillance Requirement4.4.1.2 to be performed with THERMAL POWER in excess of 25% OF RATED THERMALPOWER instead of the present prior to exceeding 25% OF RATED THERMAL POWER.Another proposed change also revised Surveillance Requirements 4.4.1.2by deleting the requirement that the recirculation flow control valvesbe in the same position when performing the surveillance.The proposed changes also include combining the sections which currentlyand separately address single and double loop operation into a single section.The application for the amendment complies with the standards and requirementsof the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission'srules and regulations. The Commission has made appropriate findings asrequired by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFRChapter I, which are set forth in the licensee's amendment.Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity for Hearingin connection with this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on November 22, 1988 (53 FR 47285). No requestfor a hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following thisnotice.The Commission has prepared an Environmental Assessment and Finding ofNo Significant Impact to this action and has determined not to preparean environmental impact statement. Based upon the Environmental Assessment,the Commission has concluded that the issuance of this amendment will nothave a significant effect on the quality of the human environment.For further details with respect to the action see (1) the applicationfor amendment dated September 6, 1988 (2) Amendment No. 18 to License No.NPF-62, and (3) the Environmental Assessment and Finding of No SignificantImpact. All of these items are available for public inspection at the Commission'sPublic Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC; and at VespasianWarner Public Library, 120 West Johnson Street, Clinton, Illinois 61727.A copy of items (2) and (3) may be obtained upon request addressed to theU.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555.
