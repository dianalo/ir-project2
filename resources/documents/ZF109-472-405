Windows users generally chose Marvin for its Windowssupport, while those looking for the lowest price opted for Alexsys EX/LAN.andM;&quot;We evaluated several products, but we chose DocuVision because it is basedon standard PC components and because of the speed of the index and storageon the optical drive,&quot; said Mike McCormick, president of Lanier BusinessSystems Inc., a computer sales and service company in New York.andP;  McCormickuses DocuVision to store and retrieve sales and parts information.andM;&quot;The indexing capabilities were appealing to us.andP;  It can get references onthe screen like a file cabinet,&quot; McCormick added.andM;Like many other DocuVision buyers, McCormick often uses a scanned image as abackground for a template  definition, a capbility not found in the other twotested products.andM;Tony DeLouise, owner of Steno Scan Systems Inc., a computer service companyspecializing in law in Ridge, N.Y., uses DocuVision to store court documentsfor exhibits and case sheets.andM;DeLouise said setting up DocuVision was somewhat demanding.andM;&quot;You need to keep in mind a lot of factors when you are designing thescreen,&quot; said DeLouise.andP;  &quot;The Biggest part is planning the database.andP;  On theuser's end, however, it is simple.&quot;andM;DeLouise is pleased with the variety of scanners DocuVision supports.andM;&quot;We have a Cannon scanner, and we were pleased that [DocuVision] supportsthis scanner as well as others,&quot; said DeLouise.andP;  &quot;For the initial conversionto the system we used a Fujitsu scanner, which was faster than the Canon.andP;  Atthe courthouses a lot of users use the ScanJet.&quot;andM;DocuVision's graphics editor, used to edit the template files or scannedimages, is useful for work in the courtroom, according to DeLouise.andP;  &quot;Itallows the user to edit material that has already [been scanned in]&quot; he said.andM;His firm uses Ventura Software Inc.'s Ventura Publisher to create differentgraphics that are used as templates, DeLouise said.andM;To send trial information from one courtroom to another, DeLouise often needsto send and receive fac images.andP;  &quot;[DocuVision] will fax documents out of theoptical disk that need to be transferred from one record-keeping place toanother,&quot; he noted.andM;Like DeLouise, Rafael Ortega, president of R.O.S.andP;  Electronic Services Inc.,andO;a systems application development company in Bayamon, Puerto Rico, findsDocuVision's backgraound-definition features helpful in his work.andM;&quot;It is the only product that gives you a customized meny where you can inputyour logo,&quot; said Ortega.andM;He also likes the product's graphics editor.andP;  &quot;With the graphics editor youcan retrieve an image, transfer it to a different format and edit it,&quot; hesaid.andM;Peter Pollack, managing director at Financial Security Assurance Inc., afinancial guarantee company in New York, uses Marvin for storing blueprintsand layouts.andM;&quot;It is a good basic file cabinet, but it lacks some power, like an interfaceto other Windows programs,&quot; he said.andM;Pollack is switching to Wang Laboratories Inc.'s Open Image image-processingsoftware because &quot;it pulls up Windows better.&quot;andM;Pollack recommends Marvin for small-scale applications.andM;&quot;On a large scale, you want a seamless system,&quot; he remarked.andP;  &quot;Marvin willpull an image out, but the way it pulls it out is confusing.&quot;andM;&quot;It pops out images on the screen, and they can be a pain to look at if youhave too many,&quot; Pollack said.andP;  &quot;Any firm would want their own front end, butwith Marvin you have to stick with what you have.andP;  [With Windows] you can'tbuild your own [user interface]&quot;andM;Valerie Harris, systems engineer at Benchmark Computer Systems Inc., asystems integrator in Arlington, Va., likes the fact that Marvin isWindows-driven.andP;  Harris uses Marvin to store field-service reports and tokeep track of technical references such as spec sheets and manuals.andP;  &quot;It ishelpful for us because if we are using Windows, we can just pop up Marvin andit is there immediately, it is easy to get into,&quot; she noted.andM;Harris prefers having the option to store files in more than one way.andM;&quot;You can either save it with a key phrase or with a template, which isuser-definable and can be changed at any time,&quot; she said.andM;Installing and setting up Marvin is easy, Harris said.andP;  However, she wishesit supported different database types such as Ashton-Tate's dBASE.andM;Steve Rubinstein, president of Optical Archive Systems Inc., a systemsintegrator and service bureau in Worcester, Mass., also credits Marvin's easeof use to the fact that it is Windows-driven.andM;&quot;It seems to have all of the function an imaging type of product shouldhave,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;The fact that it is Windows-driven makes it adaptable to anumber of different environments.&quot;andM;Rubinstein is impressed with Marvin's indexing capabilities.andP;  &quot;Indexes are inall of the fields,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Because of that, it is possible to do somevery sophisticated searches.&quot;andM;Marvin's price, however, is somewhat high, according to Rubinstein.andP;  Also, inthe future, he would like to see dynamic data exchange built into theprogram.andM;Though it is a simple product, with fewer features than DocuVision,Rubinstein recommends Marvin for both large scale and small-scale users.andM;Though some buyers interviewed by PC Week thought that Alexsys EZ/LAN lackedadvanced features, they all agreed it was easy to use and reasonably priced.andM;Curt Smith, director of data processing at Health Preferred Inc., aninsurance company in Chicago, said, &quot;We have looked at a couple of otherproducts on the market, but this was by far the easiest product to use,easier than those set up under Microsoft Windows.&quot;andM;Smith uses Alexsys EZ/LAN to store and recall invoice and claim forms, whichthe firm previously stored on microfilm.andM;&quot;I have two part-time people who are at retirement age and who have neverworked at a computer--they are the ones running the system,&quot; Smith said.andO;&quot;You can do more deep and profound things for imaging, but for what I amdoing, [Alexsys EZ/LAN] is perfect.&quot;andM;&quot;The price was definitely worth the performance; most evertying else I waslooking at was more,&quot; he added.andM;&quot;I don't expect to have incredible capabilities for the dollars that I amlooking at.andP;  I figured either use microfilm and step back, or do somethingwith imaging that would be in the same format as my computer,&quot; Smith said.andM;One limitation is that the user is limited to five user-selected fields, plusthe date of entry, he said.andM;Smith would like the Courtland Group to add automatic index generation to theproduct.andM;&quot;We run batches of invoices that are sequential numbers,&quot; he explained.andP;  &quot;Itwould be nice if it automatically assigned numbers to it.&quot;andM;Another feature Smith would like to see added is optical characterrecognition.andM;Robert Dael, senior vice president at Columbia Bank in Columbia, Md., choseAlexsys EZ/LAN for its rice and ease of use.andM;Dael uses Alexsys EZ/LAN to store customer-information cards.andM;&quot;We chose EZ/LAN because of the ease of retrieval,&quot; Dael said.andP;  &quot;It saves usa lot of time.andP;  We used to file by hand.&quot;andM;Al Cutter, president of AFC Electronics Inc., a systems integrator inLebanon, N.J., uses Alexsys EZ/LAN to create databases for custom softwareand documentation, and as a business management tool for archiving accountinginformation.andM;Cutter likes the fact that Alexsys EZ/LAN is not mouse-driven.andP;  &quot;I findgreater utility if it is non-Windows,&quot; he said, &quot;because it gives me greaterflexibility with the hardware.candM;Like other users of the product, Cutter finds the product's limited number offields restricting.andP;  &quot;You are limited to the five fields, but you can usethem multiple times,&quot; he said.andM;Cutter said Alexsys EZ/LAN's ease of use, ease of retrieval and quick setupare its strong points.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
