The 16 million Japanese households that have NintendoCo.'s game systems will soon be able to bet on horse racesfrom home. By year's end they'll be able to wager onnationally televised bicycle races too, using software thatturns their home video screens into tote boards, completewith the latest odds.</LP><TEXT>   It's more than even money that thousands will take theplunge. Mitsubishi Corp., which is marketing an interactivehome video gambling system developed by Micro Core Inc. foruse in Nintendo, notes that horse racing is increasinglypopular in Japan.   Mitsubishi and Nintendo, which sells its own remotetransaction system, have already come in winners in personalinvesting. About 100,000 Japanese homes trade stocks in thesame system where they play Dragon Quest. Since August,Mitsubishi has hooked up hundreds of home players for metalstrading on the Tokyo Commodities Exchange.   &quot;Stock trading is our best product, but home gambling willbe bigger,&quot; predicts Masahiko Kai, manager of Mitsubishi'sFuture Office Products Projects Team, which sells the20,000-yen home gaming package. He predicts his company willsign up 10,000 homes within three months of its introductionnext month, and 50,000 more the following year.   The ponies may have more allure than stocks to today'ssmall investor, for one thing because of nagging doubts aboutthe fairness of Japanese stock trading. Races are thought tobe generally honest.   Home financial transactions have been the most importantapplication for interactive computing in Japan, Mr. Kai says.Mitsubishi also sold home shopping systems. Of all theapplications Mitsubishi has tried to sell, says Mr. Kai, &quot;allthe best ones are related to making money. Or losing it, Idon't know.&quot;   Home video games become bionic bookies through a telephonemodem affixed to the Nintendo computer. The modem has specialtrading software for stocks, bonds or thoroughbreds. It'spossible to execute orders using a normal Nintendo controlpad, but a more suitable custom unit is also available.   Something like an automatic teller machine, thestock-trading system lets the home user call up priceinformation, news on bond prices, overall market movementsand prices of individual stocks. Players can buy and sell oneither the Tokyo, Osaka or Nagoya exchanges, and uponexecution of a sell order have a choice on whether to defertheir capital-gains tax payment. Brokerage houses chargeabout 1,000 yen a month for Nintendo trading on top of theircommission fees.   The graphics of the existing systems are somewhat lesssatisfying than in games like Final Fantasy or Tetris, two ofthe popular games in Japanese Nintendo. The metals-tradingsystem boots up with a rather fetching image of King Tut,however, along with a glittering ingot pyramid. Tradingcommands are also accompanied by video arcade-type music.   Couch-potato traders need to have an account at anapproved securities house. For horses, the Japan RacingAssociation, the clearing agent for legal racing bets, willuse a central computer with access to customer bank accountsapproved for telegambling.   It's already possible, though troublesome, to bet on horseraces at home in Japan. Players need clearance from theauthorities, and just before post time dash to place betsover crowded phone lines. There's a 100-yen minimum, but noupper betting limit. The new system will make it all simpler.   But how does a living room turf artist watch his race ifthe television is hooked up to a Nintendo home video-gamesystem? &quot;That's no problem,&quot; says Mr. Kai. &quot;Everyone here haslots of televisions.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
