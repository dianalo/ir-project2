In this paper, the authorsfocus on the reasons why this occurs when using standard off-the-shelfsimulators that have not been equipped with special features to properlyaddress the rate sensitivity issue. They then examine the factors thateffect rate sensitivity,i.e. fingering, oil trapping, pore structure,variations in fluid properties, capillary hysteresis, etc., and the concentrateon what a reservoir simulator requires to adequately treat these phenomena.They also demonstrate that when a simulator fulfills these requirements,rate sensitivity is exhibited in certain instances. Finally, they presentexamples for water-oil, gas-oil, gas-gas and fractured reservoir systems.</TEXT></DOC>
