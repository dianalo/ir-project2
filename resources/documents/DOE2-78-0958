The field decayis greater than the steady field decay due to joint resistances of conductors.Imaging experiments cannot be carried out during the periods, which lastten or more hours. The current distribution in the multifilamentory conductoris non-uniform just after the energization. It is suggested that thechange of the current distribution causes the initial magnetic fielddecay. A 6th order superconducting magnet was prepared for experiments(central field = 0.35 T, inner diameters = 1 m, length = 1.86 m). Thesteady state magnetic field decay was 7*10/sup -8//hr. The initial magneticfield decay was 3*10/sup -6//hr. Overshoot currents (101 and 105 percentof the rated current) were applied to the magnet and the current reducedto the rated current to improve the initial decay. The energizing andde-energizing rate of the field was 1.8 gauss/second. No initial decaywas observed when 105 percent current pattern was applied to the magnet.</TEXT></DOC>
