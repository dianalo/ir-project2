The programs are used for safety documentation purposes,operating events evaluation, operating regulation improvement, and nuclearpower unit modification evaluation. They are briefly described. Instrumentationdeveloped by the Institute is also characterized; it allows systematicmonitoring of the operating parameters and the technical and economicindices of nuclear power plant units. Attention is also paid to the evaluationof the environmental impact of nuclear power plants. A set of methodwas developed in this field for the collection, processing and measurementof environmental samples, and a number of instruments have been developedfor monitoring the production and migration of radionuclides in the environment.(Z.M.). 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
