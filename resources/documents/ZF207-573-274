Curran, said in a letter to the GAO that he anticipatesthe move to NFC will cost about $300,000 and the new system will be operatingby next summer.andM;&quot;The NFC system is not a panacea to all of the many problems we had hoped toaddress through an integrated Library Human Resources automated system,&quot; thelibrarian wrote in a separate letter to Rep.andP;  Vic Fazio (D-Calif.), chairmanof the House Appropriations Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch.andP;  &quot;Ourpresent 20-year-old semi-automated payroll system is in serious trouble andcan only be maintained with great effort, and, in case, cannot survive formore than two years.&quot;andM;The architect of the Capitol, George M. White, expressed concerns about costsin an official response to the GAO findings.andP;  &quot;In our judgment, there willdefinitely be additional costs,&quot; he said.andP;  The agency's payroll and personnelsystems now operate on multipurpose hardware and this equipment and staff torun it still will be necessary, White said.andM;The architect has 2,240 employees.andP;  The agency's payroll system uses cardpunch machines for data input, and staff members manually verify and edit thedata.andM;&quot;It's a good system, but it does need to be updated,&quot; said William F. RainesJr., administrative assistant for the architect.andM;The architect requested $750,000 in its fiscal 1990 budget request as anon-recurring expense to replace its system.andP;  The agency first requestedthese funds in October 1988.andP;  GAO questioned this figure and said the agencyhad not performed an analysis comparing in-house system development to systemsharing.andM;The agency is sticking with the budget request because the monies would beneeded for start-up costs if the architect opts to use the NFC, Raines said.andO;The agency's task force for the payroll/personnel system project plans tovisit the New Orleans facility and review the NFC systems shortly, he said.andM;&quot;A key issue will be NFC's responsiveness to GPO management's needs relativeto the demands of other agencies,&quot; said acting public printer, Joseph E.andO;Jenifer, in an official response.andP;  &quot;As one of NFC's smallest customers, GPOmay not receive the same priority as the larger agencies.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
