PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A state lawmaker has proposed that12-year-olds be allowed to vote in state elections, saying argumentsagainst her bill are the same ones once used by opponents of votingrights for women and blacks.   ``It's kind of an adult supremacist attitude,'' state Rep.Phyllis Kahn said Thursday as she introduced her bill calling for aconstitutional amendment to be placed on the state ballot for the1990 general election.   ``Do I think it's going to be instantly agreed upon and pass?No,'' said Kahn, a member of the Democratic Farmer Labor Party fromMinneapolis. ``I think it's a concept that people have to thinkabout.''   It didn't take much thinking for some legislators, like Rep.Bernie Omann, an Independent-Republican from St. Joseph, to dismissthe idea, dubbed the kiddie vote bill.   ``Is this a joke? They play a lot of jokes around here,'' saidOmann, a freshman representative who is the Legislature's youngestmember at age 24.   Pondering the possibilities, Omann asked, ``What does that meanfor politicians? Shaking hands in elementary schools?''   The bill wasn't taken as a joke by Secretary of State Joan Growe,who oversees state elections. The proposal accomplishes more thanraising the argument of who should be able to vote, she said.   ``I also believe it is really a very dramatic way of callingattention to the fact that those who can't vote truly have nopower,'' Growe said.   Kahn, who holds a doctorate in biophysics from Yale and amaster's degree from Harvard, acknowledged that she and the bill'sSenate author, Donna Peterson did have much more in mind thanchildren's suffrage.   ``I think that giving children the right to vote is an essentialpart of giving them additional political benefits. This route isjust a little less paternalistic,'' she said.   Kahn said there is nothing in the U.S. Constitution that wouldprohibit lowering the voting age, since constitutional language onlyprohibits the denial of voting rights to those 18 or older.   About whether most children under 18 are mature enough to cast avote, Kahn said, ``The alternative is just because someone is 18doesn't mean they're mature enough to vote.''</TEXT></DOC>
