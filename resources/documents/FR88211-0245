Elder, Chief OperationsOfficer, Domestic and Emergency Operations Staff, Plant Protection andQuarantine, APHIS, USDA, Room 610, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road,Hyattsvile, MD 20782; 301-436-6365.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>Citrus canker is a plant disease caused by strains of the bacterium <T3>Xanthomonas campestris </T3>pv. <T3>citri </T3>(Hasse) Dye. The disease is known to affect plants and plantparts including fruit, of citrus and citrus relatives (Family Rutaceae).It can cause defoliation and other serious damage to the leaves and twigsof susceptible plants. It may also make the fruit of diseased plants unmarketableby causing lesions on the fruit. Infected fruit may also drop from treesbefore reaching maturity. Some strains of citrus canker are an aggressivedisease that can infect susceptible plants rapidly and lead to extensiveeconomic losses in citrus growing areas.To help prevent the spread of this disease, we regulate the interstatemovement of certain plants, plant parts, and other articles from areasof the United States quarantined because of citrus canker. These regulationsare contained in 7 CFR Part 301.75 and are referred to below as the regulations.Regulated articles include plants or plant parts, including fruit and seeds,of all species, clones, cultivars, strains, varieties, and hybrids of thegeneral <T3>Citrus </T3>and <T3>Fortunella; </T3>and all clones, cultivars, strains, varieties, andhybrids of the species <T3>Poncirus trifoliata </T3>(which includes lemon, pummelo, grapefruit,key lime, persian lime, tangerine, satsuma, tangor, citron, sweet orange,sour orange, mandarin, tangelo, ethrog, kumquat, limequat, calamondin,and trifoliate orange); and any other product, article, or means of conveyancewhen an inspector determines that it presents a risk of spreading citruscanker and the person in possession of the product, article, or means ofconveyance has actual notice that it is subject to the regulations.Before the effective date of this final rule, regulated fruit could bemoved interstate from a quarantined area: (1) With a permit for scientificor experimental purposes; or (2) with a limited permit to areas of theUnited States that are not commercial citrus-producing areas.Florida is the only area of the United States quarantined because of citruscanker. Commercial citrus-producing areas are American Samoa, Arizona,California, Florida, Guam, Hawaii, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico,Texas, Virgin Islands of the United States, and the portion of Louisianasouth of a line formed by the following interstate highways. Beginningon Interstate 10 at the western boundary of the state, extending to thejunction of Interstate 10 and Interstate 12 in East Baton Rouge Parish,extending on Interstate 12 to the junction of Interstate 10 and Interstate12 in St. Tammany Parish, and extending on Interstate 10 to the Mississippistate line.On September 17, 1987, we published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> [52 FR 35105-35111, Docket No. 86-347] a proposalto allow fruit regulated because of citrus canker to be moved interstate,with a certificate, to any destination in the United States, includingcommercial citrus-producing areas, under certain conditions. We also proposedto clarify our requirements for moving regulated fruit interstate, witha limited permit, to parts of the United States that are not commercialcitrus-producing areas.Between the time the proposed rule was published and the close of the commentperiod on November 2, several infestations of citrus canker caused by Floridanursery strains \1\<NOTE/> were discovered. These infestations could not be traced toprevious infestations. Although commenters addressed various aspects ofour proposal, many of their concerns were prompted by the new detections.A number of commenters maintained that, because of these outbreaks, weshould not implement our proposed rule at this time. We agreed, believingthat the citrus canker situation in Florida needed to be reassessed inlight of the new finds, and we withdrew our proposed rule in a documentpublished in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on January 5, 1988 [53 FR 140, Docket No. 87-166].<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The Florida nursery strains of the bacterium <T3>Xanthomonas campestris </T3>pv. <T3>citri </T3>are associated primarily with outbreaks of citrus cankerin plant nurseries. They have been found only in Florida. Current informationsuggests that this form of citrus canker is pathogentically and geneticallydifferent from the disease caused by Asiatic strains of citrus canker,and never has been found on fruit in a commerical grove.Subsequently, we thoroughly reconsidered the matter and discussed it withexperts within the Department. Based on our further review of all the availablerelevant information, we have concluded that the original proposal, withcertain clarifications and modifications, would be adequate to preventthe interstate spread of citrus canker from Florida. We have determinedthat the risk of spread of citrus canker, if any, from fruit shipped underthe proposal would be negligible. This conclusion is consistent with theposition taken by the Special Task Force on Citrus Canker in Florida, afterextensive testimony was presented by experts on the current state of researchrelated to the Florida nursery strains of citrus canker and the risk ofspread of citrus canker from Florida under the proposed regulations.Therefore, with the exception of the changes discussed below, we have adoptedthe provisions of the proposed rule of the reasons set forth in the proposaland in this supplementary information section.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments </ITAG>We invited written comments on our proposed rule, stipulating that theyhad to be postmarked or received on or before November 2, 1987, and heldthree public hearings: in Los Angeles, California, on October 5, 1987;in McAllen, Texas, on October 7, 1987; and in Lake Alfred, Florida, onOctober 9, 1987.We received 40 written comments, and 41 persons commented at the publichearings. (Several of the written comments were from persons who spokeat the public hearings. One written comment was a petition signed by 19individuals; we have counted it as one comment.) The comments were fromcitrus growers, plant scientists, state agricultural officials, membersof Congress, and various other interested persons. Twenty commenters generallysupported the proposed rule. Fifty commenters either opposed the proposedrule because of its provisions to allow regulated fruit to be moved tocommercial citrus-producing areas of the United States, or they opposedvarious parts of the proposed rule related to these provisions. All commentswere carefully considered, and objections are discussed in this supplementaryinformation section. Definition of Citrus Canker Five commenters requested that we clarify the definition of ``citrus canker''by indicating that it is a disease caused by all strains of<T3> Xanthomonas campestris</T3> pv.<T3> citri,</T3> including the Florida nursery strains. We have done so.Strain Identity One commenter stated that we should address strain identity. We agree that strain identity should be addressed. As proposed, regulated fruit from the area comprised of Manatee, Pinellas,and Sarasota counties and Hillsborough County south of State Road 60 willnot be eligible for interstate movement to commercial citrus-producingareas until 2 years after the last infested plant in that area has beendestroyed. We explained in the supplementary information section to theproposed rule that ``A'' strains of citrus canker have been found in thisarea of Florida. The ``A'' strains, or Asiatic strains, are very aggressivestrains of<T3> Xanthomonas compestris</T3> pv.<T3> citri</T3> that are known to infect mature trees and commercial varietiesof citrus fruit. The protocol for moving regulated fruit interstate to commercial citrus-producingareas applies only to those areas of Florida outside the area affectedby the Asiatic strains. That is, it applies to areas of Florida where (1)citrus canker has not been found or (2) citrus canker had been detected,but the causal bacteria has been identified as a Florida nursery strain.Florida nursery strains are pathogenically and genetically different fromthe Asiatic strains that cause citrus canker. Citrus canker caused by theFlorida nursery strains has been found primarily on young plants in nurserysettings. The symptoms shown by plants infected with the Florida nurserytypes are somewhat different from the symptoms usually associated withthe citrus canker caused by the Asiatic strains. Also, although the Floridanursery strains can cause lesions on leaves, stems, and twigs of susceptibleplants, there is only one known instance of these strains infecting fruitunder natural conditions. Even so, the fruit was not a commercial varietybut was fruit of seed source trees of<T3> Poncirus trifoliata</T3> that were located at a nursery. Commercialvarieties of citrus fruit have been infected with Florida nursery strainsonly by experimental methods and under laboratory and greenhouse conditions.At this time, there is no experimental evidence, based on scientific research,to show that the Florida nursery strains would infect commerical varietiesof citrus fruit under field conditions. To clarify that the protocol for moving regulated fruit interstate to commecialcitrus-producing areas will not apply to areas of Florida affected by Asiaticstrains, we have revised proposed andSection; 301.75-7(h), ``Fruit ineligiblefor interstate movement with a certificate.'' This paragraph now states:<ITAG tagnum="21">(h)(1) Regulated fruit from any area of Florida where a primary infestationcaused by Asiatic strains has occurred will not be eligible for interstatemovement with a certificate until 2 years after the last infested plantin the area has been destroyed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Primary infestations caused by Asiatic strains have occurred inthe area of Florida comprised of Manatee, Pinellas, and Sarasota counties,and Hillsborough County south of State Road 60.</ITAG>We specify ``primary infestation'' in the above paragraph to distinguishinfestations that originate or become established in an area from thosethat do not. For example, one potted plant infected with a Florida nurserystrain was found at one location in Indian River County in 1984; however,the plant was traced to an infested nursery in central Florida, had notbeen replanted or even removed from its original container, and causedno subsequent infestations. In this incident, the potted plant was nota primary infestation. We have defined primary infestation in andSection;301.75-1 as ``An infestation that originates in a particular location orthat spreads to other plants after being introduced at a particular location.''Risk of Fruit Transmitting Citrus Canker Several commenters asserted that we should not implement our proposed rulebecause the Florida nursery strains can infect fruit and this fruit couldspread citrus canker to commerical citrus-producing areas of the country.As explained above, there is no evidence at this time to indicate thatthe Florida nursery strains have infected commercial varieties of citrusfruit under field conditions. We recognize, however, that experience orongoing research may provide this evidence. That is why certain requirementsmust be met before regulated fruit may be moved interstate to commercialcitrus producing areas of the country. Briefly, the requirements contained in andSection; 301.75-7(b) provide thatan inspector will issue a certificate for the interstate movement of regulatedfruit only if: (1) the fruit is harvested from a grove that has had noinfested or exposed plants or plant parts for at least 2 years; (2) thegrove is at least one half mile from any property that has contained infestedor exposed plants or plant parts during the past 2 years; and (3) all plantswithin one-half to 5 miles of the grove that are infested or at high riskfor developing citrus canker because of exposure to an infestation havebeen destroyed. This section contains specific requirements for surveyingthe grove and surrounding properties, as well as other requirements relatedto the origin of nursery plants added to a grove, inspections of nurseries,cleaning and disinfection of personnel, vehicles, and equipment enteringa grove, maintaining the identify of the fruit during picking, haulingto packing houses, and packing and treating fruit.In addition, our final rule requires that 100 percent of the regulatedplants at all nurseries in the state that contain regulated plants mustbe examined by an inspector approximately every 30 days.Since citrus canker was detected in Florida in 1984, there has been a comprehensiveprogram to inspect all nurseries in Florida that contain regulated plants.The surveys involve inspectors examining all regulated plants in each nurseryat least every 30 days. Our experience has been that, when citrus cankercaused by a Florida nursery strain has been present in a nursery, inspectorshave always found the disease by the third survey. Based on this experience,we are requiring nurseries to be found free of citrus canker on three surveysbefore shipping stock. The policy of requiring nurseries to be surveyedapproximately every 30 days is based on the fact that there is an incubationperiod between the time of infection and the development of visually detectablesymptoms. Repeated inspections, approximately monthly, cover this contingency.Most of the detections of citrus canker in Florida have been the resultof these surveys. In the only three instances where citrus canker causedby Florida nursery strains has been found in groves, the infected plantswere found on surveys following the movement of exposed plants. These plantswere transplants from infested nurseries. In two of these instances, therewas no evidence that citrus canker had spread from these plants to otherplants in the grove. In the third case, the grove was not well maintained,and the surveys detected some local spread to sprouts from Swingle rootstock. In none of these instances was any infected fruit found, and, afterthe infected plants were removed, no additional infections were observed.This experience demonstrates the effectiveness of the nursery surveys andother surveys that may be triggered by them.Furthermore, when citrus canker has been found in a nursery, it has beenfound at very low levels_only a few plants out of thousands. Based on thelow incidence of infected plants and the early stage of the disease atthe time of detections, it appears that these surveys are extremely effectivein detecting the disease.Because of the high sensitivity of the nursery surveys, we believe thesesurveys provide the best single indicator of those areas in Florida wherecitrus canker may be present. Therefore, we believe the interstate movementof regulated fruit to commercial citrus-producing areas of the United Statesmust be contingent upon these surveys being continued.We believe our requirements for fruit certification, strengthened in thisfinal rule, will (1) minimize the risk of citrus canker being introducedinto a grove; (2) maximize our ability to detect citrus canker at a veryearly stage if it is introduced into a grove; (3) reduce the negligiblerisk of regulated fruit spreading citrus canker interstate to commercialcitrus-producing areas.Significance of the Recent Detections of Citrus CankerMany commenters maintained that we should not implement our proposal becausethe eight new finds of citrus canker this past fall indicate that we donot know enough about the Florida nursery strains. A number of commentersalso asserted that, because citrus canker may not be detected by visualinspection during its dormant stage, we should postpone action on the proposaluntil no additional citrus canker is detected for a certain period of time.The period of time suggested by commenters ranged from 18 months (5 commenters)to 5 years (1 commenter), with most commenters (8) advocating 2 years.As previously indicated, we have determined that our protocol in the regulationsfor qualifying fruit for a certificate is adequate to prevent the interstatespread of citrus canker.As explained above, we have not found commercial varieties of citrus fruitinfected with Florida nursery strains under field conditions, and the riskof spread of citrus canker from fruit shipped under our protocol is negligible.The multiple safeguards prescribed in our protocol for qualifying fruitfor a certificate will reduce the risk even further.Moreover, the protocol assumes that citrus canker could be present in agrove but dormant, or at low levels, and therefore be undetectable by visualsurveys. The very first requirement stipulates that groves producing fruitfor certification cannot have had any infested or exposed plants for atleast 2 years. Two years was chosen because it is the period of time duringwhich we would expect to find visible symptoms of citrus canker if it werepresent in a grove. A grove that has been free of infested or exposed plantsfor 2 years would be unlikely to contain even low levels of infestation.We also require that all shipments of nursery plants received by the groveduring the past 2 years must have come only from nurseries found free ofcitrus canker on multiple surveys. The grove also must be at least one-halfmile from any property that has contained infested or exposed plants orplant parts during the past 2 years. Again, we recognize that symptom expressionmay be delayed for up to 2 years, and we have factored this into the regulations.Nevertheless, we agree that if citrus canker were introduced into a grove,visual surveys probably would not detect it at low levels. These low levelsof infestation, however, would be unlikely to cause infection in fruit.By the time the infestation in a grove reached a level where significantamounts of fruit were put at risk for becoming infected, it also wouldbegin to produce enough visible symptoms to allow detection of the infestationon surveys.Although undetectable levels of citrus canker could cause surface contaminationof fruit, treating the fruit would destroy most of the bacteria present,and waxing would trap and render harmless any remaining bacteria for therelatively short time they might survive. Both treating and waxing arerequired for all fruit moved interstate with a certificate.Therefore, we find no reason to either abandon or significantly modifyour protocol as a result of the comments.SurveysMany commenters contended that we should not implement the proposed rulebecause the surveys would be unworkable and inadequate to detect citruscanker. Some commenters also stated that they did not believe we had enoughinspectors to perform the required surveys.The surveys, as proposed, are a continuation of an existing survey programin Florida, which forms the basis for the current movement of fruit underlimited permit. These surveys are a prerequisite to certification of fruit.While we are not depending entirely on surveys to detect citrus cankerif it is present in a grove, the surveys are an integral part of the protocolset forth in the proposed regulations which was extensively reviewed byscientific experts. They have concluded, as indicated above, that the protocolis sufficient to prevent the interstate spread of citrus canker on fruit.We have, however, made two changes to the survey protocol in response tocomments:Some commenters maintained that the surveys should be conducted ``followinga flush of growth'' or ``at periods coinciding with symptom expression.''Our proposal stipulated that at least one of the two required grove surveysbe conducted during weather conditions (high temperatures and frequentrainfall) that an inspector determines are conducive to the developmentof citrus canker. Our intent was to require at least one survey to be conductedduring a time coinciding with symptom expression, which would be followinga flush of growth. We have clarified this in the final rule by requiringat least one of the two surveys to be conducted between 4 to 12 weeks aftera period of high temperatures and frequent rainfall likely to cause a flushof growth on regulated trees.Some comments said that ``drive-bys'' at 3 m.p.h. were too fast. We agreeand have changed the final rule to require the inspections to be conductedat 2 m.p.h.Determining Whether Groves and Surrounding Properties Have Been Free ofInfested or Exposed PlantsTwo commenters questioned the ability of inspectors to determine whetherany infested or exposed plants have been moved to a grove or surroundingproperties.The State of Florida requires nurseries to maintain extensive records,which, should the disease be detected in a nursery, would be adequate todetermine where potentially infected or exposed plants from that nurseryhad been moved. These records would allow the Joint State-Federal CitrusCanker Eradication Project to determine whether any infected or exposedplants had been moved out of an infested nursery and to take regulatoryactions to remove groves from the certification program if necessary.Sources of Infection from Early MovementsOne commenter said that the proposed rule should not be implemented untilwe had completed risk assessment of nursery stock from the Ben Hill GriffinBlue Jordan nursery, where citrus canker caused by the Florida nurserystrains had been detected. All nursery plants that may have been exposedor infected as a result of this outbreak have now been traced.One commenter stated that we should not implement the proposed rule becausenot all transplants shipped from infested nurseries ``early in Florida'sfight against citrus canker'' were traced. The commenter is apparentlyreferring to plants moved from certain nurseries found infested in 1984.Although some plants were not traced, we do not believe this is cause forpostponing or cancelling the proposed rule. These plants may or may nothave been exposed or infested. If any were infected or developed infections,these plants would have developed visible symptoms before now. In mostof Florida, particularly the citrus-producing areas, all residential propertiesand commercial groves containing regulated plants have been surveyed atleast twice. An intensive public relations campaign has also been underwaysince 1984 to inform all Florida property owners about citrus canker. Giventhis scenario, it is unlikely that transplants shipped from nurseries in1984 remain today as sources of infection in Florida.Effect of New OutbreaksSeveral commenters asserted that in case of suspicious samples or new outbreaksof citrus canker, we should discontinue the interstate movement of certifiedfruit until the status of the suspicious samples was determined or an evaluationwas made of the new outbreak.We would carefully examine and seriously consider the risks associatedwith any new finds of citrus canker in Florida and take appropriate action.If citrus canker were found in a grove, fruit from that grove would beineligible for certification for at least 2 years.Qualifications of InspectorsSeveral commenters asserted that individual inspectors either were notqualified to make all the determinations proposed or could not handle theworkload. Some commenters maintained that inspectors should be plant pathologists.Again, we must point out that many of the determinations are made by theJoint State-Federal Citrus Canker Eradication Project based on recordsrequired by the State of Florida.Furthermore, all inspectors receive adequate orientation and training,and, where necessary, plant pathologists do perform the work. For example,project decisions involving risk assessments are based on the recommendationsof a team of experts, including plant pathologists.MonitoringSeveral commenters said greater assurances were needed that there wouldbe compliance with provisions of the proposed rule.The Joint State-Federal Citrus Canker Eradication Project monitors compliancewith the requirements for moving citrus fruit interstate from Florida.Should it be determined that the effectiveness of these requirements werejeopardized by noncompliance with the regulations or with those state requirementsessential to the regulations, we would take appropriate action, which couldinclude suspending certification.Maintaining the Identity of FruitSeveral commenters asserted that we need a protocol to ensure that theidentity of fruit to be moved with a certificate is maintained.The Joint State-Federal Citrus Canker Eradication Project has requirementsfor maintaining the identity of fruit during picking, hauling to the packinghouse, and packing. The requirements stipulate use of harvesting permitsand, for fresh fruit, use of identification tags indicating the originof each field box containing fruit. These documents serve to identify thefruit from the grove and through the packing process.Risk of Fruit Contamination at Packing HousesTwo commenters expressed concern that fruit eligible for certificationmight become contaminated in a packing house that also processed fruitineligible for certification.We believe this protential contamination presents no additional risk becauseit would be surface contamination only and the fruit would be subsequentlytreated and waxed.Movement of Noncertified Fruit to Citrus-Producing AreasSeveral commenters argued that allowing some fruit to move to citrus-producingareas of the United States would increase the risk of fruit ineligiblefor this movement ending up in these areas.We believe the opposite is true. Because the certification program wouldallow desirable varieties of Florida fruit to be legally moved into citrus-producingareas, there would be less incentive for people to take Florida fruit intothese areas illegally.Another commenter suggested that additional safeguards, such as publiceducation and public service campaigns, be implemented to further decreasethe chances that fruit ineligible for certification might be shipped tocitrus-producing areas. Public information campaigns have been in placein Florida since 1984, and warnings are posted in public areas such asairports and post offices.PreambleSome commenters were concerned about the omission from the proposed ruleof a preamble that had been included in a preliminary recommendation onguidelines for fruit certification prepared by a group of plant pathologists.This preamble was intended to clearly indicate that a program for certificationof fresh fruit would only be appropriate where an effective national eradicationprogram was being conducted.We believe the inclusion of this preamble is unnecessary because the regulationsapply only to the current infestation in the State of Florida.Groves of Fewer Than 10 TreesTwo commenters requested that we allow fruit from groves of fewer than10 trees to be moved interstate to areas of the United States that arenot commercial citrus-producing areas. Our rule permits this in accordancewith the requirements for movement with limited permit.One commenter complained about the cost of having dooryard fruit treatedbefore it could be sent with limited permit to areas that are not commercialcitrus-producing areas. The cost of treatment is about $3 to $4 a bushel.We have examined this issue and found no less costly method of fruit treatmentavailable that would provide the same degree of protection.Limited PermitsFour commenters requested that we change the requirements for limited permitto allow exposed plants to remain in a grove if they are not at high riskfor disease development.After consulting with plant pathologists and regulatory officials knowledgeablein this area, we have determined that this action would not result in anysignificant increase in the risk of spreading citrus canker.We have agreed that identification of plants at high risk for developingcitrus canker will be based on an evaluation of all circumstances relatedto their exposure, including, but not limited to, the following: (1) Thestage of maturity of the exposed plants at the time of exposure; (2) thesize and degree of infestation to which the plants were exposed; (3) theproximity of the exposed plants to the infested plants at the time of exposure;(4) the length of time the plants were exposed to the infestation; and(5) the strain of bacterium to which the plants were exposed. Any plantsdetermined to be at high risk for disease development must be destroyedif the fruit from the grove is to be moved interstate.Definition of GroveOne commenter requested that we clarify the definition of ``grove'' byspecifying that a grove is separated from other trees by a boundary, suchas a fence, stream, road, canal, irrigation ditch, hedgerow, open space,or a sign or marker denoting change of fruit variety, that is identifiableto an inspector as the boundary of the grove. The proposed rule did notinclude ``sign or marker denoting change of fruit variety'' as a possibleboundary. We have made this change.Other CommentsOne commenter said that hurricanes could spread citrus canker in Florida.This may or may not be true, but we have procedures in place to detectinfestations of citrus canker. We also have safeguards in place to ensurethat fruit moved interstate from Florida presents a very insignificantrisk of spreading citrus canker.One commenter argued that the proposed rule should not be implemented becausegrapefruit, the major citrus crop in Texas, is particularly susceptibleto Strain ``A''. These regulations do not allow certification of fruitfrom any area in Florida where we believe Strain ``A'' may be present.<ITAG tagnum="84">Miscellaneous Changes</ITAG>We also have replaced the term ``Deputy Administrator'' wherever it appearedin andSection;301.75 with the term ``Administrator'' to reflect internalagency policy, and have made nonsubstantive editorial changes for clarity.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>We are issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291, andwe have determined that it is not a ``major rule.'' Based on informationcompiled by the Department, we have determined that this rule will havean effect on the economy of less than $100 million; will not cause a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, federal,state, or local government agencies, or geographic regions and will notcause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.Our rule allows regulated fruit from groves of 10 or more trees to be movedinterstate from Florida to any destination in the United States, includingcommercial citrus-producing areas. Previously, this fruit could be movedinterstate only to parts of the United States that were not commercialcitrus-producing areas.This change in the regulations will provide additional markets for someFlorida fruit. However, the amount of fruit affected is relatively small.Most regulated Florida fruit is processed for juice within the state. Lessthan 20 percent of regulated Florida fruit is consumed as fresh fruit,and much of this is consumed within the state or is exported to foreigncountries.Figures from the State of Florida Department of Citrus show that in 1983-84,the last complete season before Florida was quarantined for citrus canker,the amount of fresh citrus shipped to Arizona, California, Louisiana, andTexas was 4.3% of the fresh citrus shipped to all states combined. We donot expect that our rule will result in any increase in this percentage.Our rule will not allow regulated fruit from groves to fewer than 10 treesto be moved interstate to commercial citrus-producing areas because wedo not have the personnel or funds to provide the necessary services tocertify fruit from the thousands of small groves in Florida. However, wedo not expect this limitation to have any significant economic effect onsmall-grove owners since, in the past, most regulated fruit moved interstatefrom Florida as fresh fruit has gone to areas of the United States thatare not commercial citrus-producing areas. Owners of dooryard, or backyard,trees, in particular, ship fresh fruit interstate primarily as gifts torelatives or friends in parts of the United States where citrus is notgrown.Our rule also allows fruit from groves of fewer than 10 regulated treesto be moved interstate with a limited permit only if it goes directly toa household, with the intent that the fruit be consumed at, or by membersof, that household. Most groves of fewer than 10 regulated trees are onresidential properties and are not maintained for profit. Fruit from thesegroves generally is consumed locally or, as noted above, is delivered asgifts to relatives or friends. Therefore, we do not expect this restrictionto have any significant economic effect on small-grove owners.Under these circumstances, the Acting Administrator of the Animal and PlantHealth Inspection Service has determined that this rule will not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501<T3> et seq</T3>.), we have submitted the information collection provisionsin this final rule to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for approval.You may send written comments on these provisions to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, OMB, Attention: Desk Officer for APHIS, Washington,DC 20503.
