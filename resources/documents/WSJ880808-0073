The company, whose full name is Integra -- A Hotel andamp; Restaurant Co., said the spin-off of its stake in ShowBiz Pizza Time Inc. also calls for ShowBiz to acquire its 58 Monterey House Mexican-food restaurants for $11 million.    ShowBiz has obtained a $10 million, five-year loan from First National Bank of Boston and a $5 million subordinated loan from Hallwood Group, a merchant bank that restructured Integra two years ago. Hallwood also has guaranteed the bank loan, and will receive, in exchange, warrants to buy as much as 23% of ShowBiz's fully diluted shares for 40 cents a share in 1993.    Of that $15 million, Integra said it will receive $12.5 million from ShowBiz to retire inter-company debt, which it will use for capital improvements and working capital. ShowBiz will keep $2.5 million in working capital and will still owe Integra $17 million. </TEXT></DOC>
