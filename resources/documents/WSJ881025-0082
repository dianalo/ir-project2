The provision stems mainly from costs of completing certain waste-to-energy and fluid-bed power plants that involve new technologies.    In the year-earlier period, the Stamford, Conn.-based company, which provides engineered products and systems for power and process markets, had net income of $15.3 million, or 40 cents a share. Sales rose 13% to $897.1 million from $791.2 million.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Combustion Engineering shares closed at $29.75, down 37.5 cents.    The company also cited fewer completions of long-term contracts for utility-size power plants. Combustion Engineering has been seeing fewer of these orders and has shifted its emphasis to providing services for the large plants and to building smaller-scale projects, particularly in cogeneration.    Robert McCoy, an analyst at UBS Securities Inc. in New York, estimates that on an operating basis, Combustion Engineering earned about 19 cents a share compared with analysts' expectations of about 50 cents. For the year, earnings appear to be heading toward $1.30 a share, against analysts' estimates of $1.90 to $2.    The company's &quot;overhead is a little too high to support the current business environment,&quot; the analyst said.    On the upside, Combustion Engineering reported a gain of $28.2 million from disposition of assets in the third quarter, and Charles Hugel, chairman and chief executive officer, said that most operations have been performing well in 1988.    The industrial minerals business continues strong, the executive said. The line produces kaolin, used as a filler and coating in the paper-making process, and minerals for refractories, which require heat-resistant materials.    Another positive, Mr. McCoy added, was the rise in the backlog from continuing operations to $3.7 billion at Sept. 30 from $3.5 billion a year earlier. </TEXT></DOC>
