 Just consider all the promising software that has, over thepast decade, languished on the shelf.andM;The factors that make software &quot;good&quot; on the other hand are fairlydiscernible.andP;  First, the program has to have all the basic features needed tofulfil its stated function (it has to work).andP;  Second, the program should beeasy enough to use so that it's practical for its intended audience to use.andM;And finally, it should make the user more effective, efficient or productivein some way.andM;A program that does all of this and helps the user to be more &quot;creative&quot;deserves the highest praise.andP;  Aldus Persuasion is a rare example of softwarethat does all this and more.andM;A tool capable of helping everyone from the novice to the expert computeruser, PErsuasion can produce quality presentation graphics faster than youwould have thought possible.andM;It has a wealth of useful features but is easy to learn so that most anyonecan be creating professional looking presentations not in days or weeks butliterally in minutes.andM;Aldus Persuasion (2.0) is, first and foremost, an outline processor.andP;  If allyou need is fast, attractive text charts nothing beats the ease and speed ofthis program.andP;  Simply type your points and print.andM;The program selects a default template for you and once you have entered yourpoints on the outliner, it creates all of your slides automatically, completewith headings, bullets, formating, etc.andM;If you want to get more creative you have access to a library of 36predefined, professional quality templates.andP;  In essence these &quot;Autotemplates&quot;are predefined master slides with the fonts, type sizes and graphic effectsalready in place.andM;To select a template simply browse through the library using either theAutotemplate guide book or by viewing each onscreen.andM;Within each template you have &quot;Maste slide&quot; options as well.andP;  These definesub-types within your presentation so your bullet text has a slightlydifferent look than say your charts or graphics slides.andP;  Moreover the Masterslide feature allows you to add a corporate logo, name, or symbol so that itappears on each slide.andP;

 Beyond simply text, the options Persuasion providesinclude features for customizing your presentation.andM;You can choose from hundreds of typefaces and fonts or add graphics in anumber of formats.andM;If you want to add graphics or backgrounds, simply import one from thePersuasion gallery of art, or draw your own using the programs drawfacilities or import graphics from other programs.andM;Then view the slides in a slide show complete with special effects like fadesand wipes.andP;  If you need charting capabilities, Persuasion offers links withexternal spreadsheets or use the built-in workspace for creating one of tendifferent chart types.andM;Once you've created the slide show, changes are just as simple.andP;  If you wishto rearrange the order of your slides use the slide sorter is a simple aspointing, clicking and dragging.andM;Persuasion is also equipped to handle color and has a small library of fullcolour templates.andM;Are you already using Power Point?andP;

 A listing of services bureaus is provided with thesoftware including Autographx, Genigraphics and Crosfield Dicomed services,located in most major cities in North America.andM;Persuasion makes the chore of preparing a presentation painless, no matterwhat your level of expertise.andM;More complex programs, offering fewer features become impractical if notimpossible to use if you employee them twice in the course of a year, acommon complaint with users of presentation software.andM;The user finds that each and every time they set out on a new project, theyhave to re-travel that steep learning curve.andP;  Not so with Aldus Persuasion.andM;In a matter of minutes the most novice user can create a lengthypresentation.andM;With a little more time complex, graphic intense, presentations can becreated as well.andM;It only helps create a presentation but adds to your creativity by providingprofessional templates, by better organizing your ideas and by providing youwith all the tools necessary for creating quality presentations quickly.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
