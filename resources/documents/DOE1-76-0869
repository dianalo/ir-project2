<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-76-0869 </DOCNO><TEXT>The design of an experimental insertion for the SSC suitable for a veryforward spectrometer is presented. This design has a usable space of+-1000 m around the interaction point and can achieve a luminosity ofapproximately 10/sup 30/ cm/sup -2/ s/sup -1/. The design utilizes large-aperturequadrupoles which are part of the spectrometer array to focus the twobeams. In order to achieve the necessary free space for this design,a beam bypass of one of the clustered straight sections is utilized.This bypass allows for the possibility of two, approximately 2.5 km sectionsfree of horizontal dipole magnets. The bypass stubs needed to permitthis possibility to be implemented in the future would increase the overallcircumference of the SSC by roughly 3%.</TEXT></DOC>
