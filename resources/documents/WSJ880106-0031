Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said the U.S. will examine whether European oilseed subsidies violate fair-trade rules set by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Mr. Yeutter acted on a petition filed by the American Soybean Association, which claims U.S. soybean exports to the community have declined by 40% since 1982 because of such practices, and are costing U.S. farmers as much as $1.7 billion a year in lost sales.    The EC has denied the subsidy program discriminates against foreign oilseed suppliers. The U.S. will first try to resolve the issue through consultations. If that procedure fails, the U.S. will request arbitration by a panel to be formed under General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade rules.    U.S. exports of soybean, soybean oil and similar products currently total about $2 billion a year, U.S. officials said. </TEXT></DOC>
