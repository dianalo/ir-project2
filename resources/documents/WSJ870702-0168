Western said the agreement, which is subject to regulatory approval, calls for Imperial's American Savings Association, Wichita, Kan., to transfer about $400 million in assets for Western's Columbia Savings Association to assume American's deposits. The assets will be mostly cash, Western said.    Western said Columbia will use some of the assets to repay borrowings at the Topeka Federal Home Loan Bank. It also expects to expand its loan portfolio to support the increased deposits.    Columbia currently has about $600 million in assets and 12 offices. When the acquisition is completed, probably in December, Columbia will have about $850 million in assets, Western said. </TEXT></DOC>
