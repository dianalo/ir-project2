Major targets of the effort aided by sophisticated geneticengineering techniques include cancer and AIDS.   ``Five years ago there were predictions that Japan wouldovertake us in biotechnology by the end of the decade,'' saidGerald J. Mossinghoff, president of the PharmaceuticalManufacturers Association. ``That has not happened. There isenormous vitality in today's biotechnology research and developmentin the United States,'' he added.   Mossinghoff said 70 genetically engineered drugs and vaccinesare currently in human clinical tests in this country, while 10others on which clinical testing has been completed are at the Foodand Drug Administration for review before they can be marketed.   He also said that of 182 biotechnology health care patentsissued in the United States last year, 155 had American owners _far ahead of Japan with 15 patents and Western Europe with nine.   Mossinghoff was joined at a news conference by Henry I. Miller,a special assistant to FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young.   Miller said a survey recently conducted by the FDA of Japanesepharmaceutical research and development ``reveals that despite ahigh level of activity in Japanese industry, the U.S. does, indeed,appear to be ahead of its Japanese counterparts in newbiotechnology pharmaceuticals.''   ``Japanese production of new drugs with biotechnology techniquesis robust, but the U.S. holds roughly a two to one lead in bothnumbers of companies involved and numbers of products,'' the FDAofficial said.   Genetic engineering involves manipulating the genes thatdetermine the fundamental physical characteristics of an organism.   A survey released by the industry association found that canceris still the main focus of pharmaceutical biotechnology research.More than half _ 45 _ of the products involved in clinical tests orundergoing FDA review are targeted at cancer or cancer-relatedconditions.   It also reported that 14 genetically engineered products _almost twice as many as were listed in the association's first suchsurvey last July _ are being tested for AIDS or AIDS-relatedillnesses.   Mossinghoff said the association was concerned about efforts bystates to get involved in ``duplicative and unnecessaryregulation'' of biotechnology, despite the existence of ``acomprehensive regulatory scheme at the federal level.''   He said that in 1988, 10 state legislative measures wereintroduced and three passed _ in Hawaii, Maine and Wisconsin.   Currently, Mossinghoff said, a biotechnology-related bill isawaiting the governor's action in Wisconsin while additionalmeasures are pending before legislators in Wisconsin, New Jersey,New York, Oregon, Texas and Washington state.</TEXT></DOC>
