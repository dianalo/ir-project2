(Executivebriefing)andM;</TITLE><SUMMARY>A report by FoundationWare Inc pres Peter Tippett warns thatcomputer viruses my infect as many as 8 million microcomputers bythe year 1992 and cost up to $10 billion in lost data, downtime,and recovery.andP;  Several consulting groups predict that the spreadof viruses will result in a loss of confidence in microcomputersecurity, possibly weakening the industry by slowing computersales.andP;  Preventative strategies advocated in the report includetighter control over new software introduced onto microcomputersand LANs, write-protecting floppy disks, booting only from harddisks, strict software registration programs, and use of disklessworkstations on LANs.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Company:   FoundationWare (reports).andO;Topic:     Computer industryComputer virusesData SecurityReports.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Computer Virus Growth Could Chill PC IndustryandM;Even if no new computer viruses are written, existing viruses will almostcertainly spread to millions of personal computers over the next few years,according to a recently released study.andM;Dr.andP;  Peter Tippett, president of software firm FoundationWare Inc. and afaculty member at Case Western Reserve University, has released a theoreticalanalysis of the likely spread of viruses, &quot;The Kinetics of Computer VirusReplication.&quot;andM;Tippett predicts that viruses will infect as many as 8 million personalcomputers over the next two years and that the costs of lost data, downtimeand recovery could range from $5 billion to $10 billion over the next fiveyears.andM;At a press conference held March 20 in Washington, Tippett's analysis wassupported by Andrew Seybold, publisher of the newsletter Andrew Seybold'sOutlook on Professional Computing, as well as by representatives ofaccounting firm Ernst andamp; Young, market-research company Creative StrategiesResearch International and computer consulting firm Data Security SystemsInc.andM;The group unanimously predicted that explosive growth in computer virusesfrom today's very low levels may well result in a loss of confidence in thesecurity and stability of computer systems in general and PCs in particular.andM;This loss of confidence could translate into a reduction in the use ofpersonal computers, with resulting stagnation of the computer industry andlost productivity above and beyond the direct losses caused by the viruses.andM;Based on the data available, Tippett calculated that the doubling rate forone of the few well-tracked viruses, the Jerusalem virus, ranges from 1.5 to2.6 months.andP;  The doubling rate is the period of time required for a virus todouble its presence on new computer systems.andM;Given this range of doubling rates and assuming that less than one in 5,000PCs is today infected with a virus with the replicating capability of theJerusalem virus, Tippett said that by just projecting the growth of the 70 to100 known viruses, as many as 12 million PCs will be infected by virusessometime in the next three to five years.andM;Tippett advocates a number of preventive strategies: tighter control over newprograms introduced onto PCs and LANs; the use of write-protect tabs on allfloppy disks; booting only from hard disks; the use of diskless PCs on LANs;and the use of software registration and validation programs, which monitorthe executable programs run on individual PCs.andM;The report is available from FoundationWare Inc., which is located inCleveland and can be reached at (216) 752-8181.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
