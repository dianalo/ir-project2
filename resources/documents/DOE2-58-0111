In this work the effects of fusion-relevant high helium concentrationson the mechanical properties of the fully martensitic steel DIN 1.4914(the reference material for NET) has been studied. Foil specimens of90 {mu}m thickness of two different heats were homogeneously implantedwith helium by a cyclotron under various conditions. Tensile tests wereperformed at temperatures from 273 K to 973 K and creep tests at 873K and 973 K with specimens preimplanted at test temperatures. 'In-beam'tests (creep to rupture under simultaneous implantation) were carriedout at 873 K and 973 K with helium concentrations up to 3000 and 2700appm, respectively. The ruptured specimens were investigated for fracturemode (SEM) and helium bubble microstructure (TEM).</TEXT></DOC>
