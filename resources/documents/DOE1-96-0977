<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-96-0977 </DOCNO><TEXT>A compete analysis of the {sup 1}H and {sup 13}C NMR spectra and the determinationof chemical shifts and coupling constants were carried out for 9,10-dihydro-9,9,10,10-tetramethyl-9,10-disilaanthracene,dimethyldiphenylsilane, and their mono- and bis-(tricarbonylchromium)complexes. The differences observed between the values of the ASIS effectsand coupling constants in the {sup 1}H and {sup 13}C NMR spectra of thecis dinuclear complex and of the mono(tricarbonyl-chromium) complex andtrans dinuclear complex are explained by the different geometry and moleculardynamics of these compounds. The change in the geometry of the dinuclearcomplexes influences the shielding of the {sup 29}Si nuclei only slightly.Complex formation does not have a substantial influence on the {sup 1}Hand {sup 13}C chemical shifts of the noncoordinated rings and the methylgroups. {sup 29}Si chemical shifts depend additively on the presenceof tricarbonylchromium groups.</TEXT></DOC>
