Ford recalled his statement during a 1976 presidential campaigndebate with Jimmy Carter, who went on to defeat him, that ``thereis no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, and there never will beunder a Ford administration.''   ``I blew it,'' Ford wrote.   But, he added, ``Reading the verbatim record with 20-20hindsight in the light of recent developments in Poland andthroughout Eastern Europe, I come out pretty well as a prophet.''   Thirteen years after he made the statement that angered manyAmericans of Eastern European descent, Ford said countries in theSoviet orbit ``are writing themselves new constitutions, based onfundamental human rights and freedoms.''   The former president noted that ``boasting, like lusting, isbest limited to one's heart.''   So, he added, ``when my friends say, `You know, what you saidabout Poland not being dominated by the Soviet Union wasn't sostupid after all'' I give them a Sphinx-like smile and accept their(I guess) compliments.''</TEXT></DOC>
