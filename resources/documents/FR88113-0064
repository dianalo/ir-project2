(MSG), the Named Fiduciary (the Named Fiduciary) onbehalf of the Plan. Authority to grant the proposed amendments to the exemptionis given the Department under section 408(a) of the Act, section 4975(c)(2)of the Code and ERISA Procedure 75-1 (40 FR 18471, April 28, 1975).   If the proposed amendments are adopted, paragraph (A) of PTE 85-211 wouldbe restated so that the restrictions of sections 406(a) of the Act andthe sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code,by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (D) of the Code shall not applyuntil January 21, 1990 to the adjustment, disposition, and/or continuationby investment managers of any pre-existing loan, lease, service agreement,or other arrangement, or the holding by the Plan of any pre-existing employersecurity or real property [as described in Part VIII of PTE 77-11 (42 FR54041, October 7, 1977) and PTE 84-114 (49 FR 30609, July 31, 1984)], butonly to the extent that PTE 84-14 (49 FR 9494, March 13, 1984) is not applicablewith respect to such transactions by reason of any of the following: (1)The assets of the Plan represent more than 20 percent of the total clientassets under the management of the investment manager at the time of thetransaction; (2) the investment manager does not satisfy the definitioncontained in Part V(a)(4) of PTE 84-14; or (3) the transaction is betweenthe Plan and the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Health andWelfare Fund (the Welfare Plan), or the transaction is between the Planand a person which is a party in interest and at the time of the transaction[as defined in Part V(i) of PTE 84-14] either such party in interest orits ``affiliate'' [as defined in Part V(c) of PTE 84-14] has the authorityor, during the preceding one year, has exercised the authority: (a) Toappoint or terminate the Named Fiduciary of the Plan or (b) to otherwisealter the terms under which a person serves as the Named Fiduciary of thePlan.    <T3>Effective Date: </T3>If granted, the proposed amendments would be effectiveJanuary 1, 1985. They will expire on January 21, 1992.    Summary of Facts and Representations    1. <T3>The Plan. </T3>The Plan is a multiemployer defined benefit pensionplan established in 1955 by an Agreement and Declaration of Trust betweenvarious local unions affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters,Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America and employers having collectivebargaining agreements with those unions. The Plan is jointly administeredby eight trustees (the Trustees), an equal number of whom are appointedindirectly by participating unions and employers in compliance with section302(c)(5) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, as amended.   More than 10,000 employers currently make contributions to the Plan undercollective bargaining agreements involving approximately 300 local unionorganizations. The number of active and retired participants and beneficiariesin the Plan as of December 31, 1985 totaled approximagely 459,000. As ofMarch 31, 1987, the total of the Plan's assets under control of MSG wasvalued at approximately $8.16 billion.    2. <T3>The 1977 Agreements. </T3>In 1977, pursuant to an agreement with theDepartment and the Internal Revenue Service (the Service), the Trusteesentered into a series of contracts with certain independent investmentmanagers, delegating to them direct control over the Plan's assets. Byagreements dated June 30, 1977, the Trustees appointed The Equitable LifeAssurance Society of the United States (Equitable) to serve as the NamedFiduciary of the Plan and as an investment manager for 25 percent of thePlan's securities-related assets. The Trustees also appointed three additionalinvestment managers to manage the Plan's remaining securities-related assets.In addition, Equitable and Victor Palmieri and Company, Incorporated (VPCO)were appointed to manage the Plan's real estate-related assets.    As the Named Fiduciary, Equitable was given exclusive responsibility todevelop investment policies and objectives for the Plan; allocate the assetsamong different types of investments and investment managers; and appoint,remove and monitor the performance of the securities-related investmentmanagers. The Trustees retained responsibility for monitoring the performanceof Equitable both as the Named Fiduciary and as investment manager forthe securities-related and real estate-related assets. Both Equitable andthe Trustees were empowered to monitor the performance of VPCO.    3. <T3>The Consent Decree (the Consent Decree). </T3>To resolve outstandinglitigation against the Plan and the Trustees, certain negotiations betweenthe Department and the Plan culminated in the adoption of the Consent Decreewhich was entered on September 22, 1982 by the United States District Courtfor the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Divison (the Court). TheConsent Decree requires that all assets of the Plan be subject to the exclusiveauthority and control of the Named Fiduciary. The Consent Decree givesthe Named Fiduciary exclusive authority to manage all present and futureinvestments of the Plan (other than assets held in the Benefits and AdministrationAccount) or to delegate this authority to such investment managers andreal estate managers as it determines are necessary to manage the Plan'sassets. The Consent Decree provides that the Trustees retain the responsibilityto monitor the performance of the Named Fiduciary. The Trustees are furtherempowered by the Consent Decree to terminate the Named Fiduciary withoutcause upon six months' written notice.\1\<NOTE/>    <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The Named Fiduciary may also be removed by the Court forgood cause shown after 60 days' notice is given to the Named Fiduciaryand the Department. However, the removal of the Named Fiduciary, with orwithout cause, may only occur concurrent with Court approval of the appointmentof a similarly-qualified successor Named Fiduciary.    To further the objectives of the Consent Decree, the Department and thePlan agreed to the appointment by the Court of an independent special counsel(the Independent Special Counsel). The Court has appointed Mr. WilliamB. Saxbe (Mr. Saxbe), former Attorney General of the United States as theIndependent Special Counsel. The Independent Special Counsel is requiredto devote special attention to compliance by all Plan fiduciaries withthe fiduciary responsibility provisions of the Act and is authorized tomonitor and review the activities of the Trustees, the Named Fiduciary,the investment managers and other parties. The Independent Special Counselis also required to file written quarterly reports with the Court regardingmatters within his jurisdiction.   5. <T3>Appointment of MSG as the Named Fiduciary. </T3>On November 16, 1983,the Trustees adopted a resolution to appoint MSG as the Named Fiduciaryof the Plan and to succeed Equitable, subject to the Court's approval.On November 17, 1983, the Trustees implemented the resolution by enteringinto a contract with MSG (formerly known as Morgan Stanley, Inc.), therebyappointing MSG as the Named Fiduciary, effective January 20, 1984 (the1983 Named Fiduciary Agreement). Under the 1983 Named Fiduciary Agreement,MSG was given exclusive authority to manage and control the assets of thePlan (except for assets held in the Benefits and Administration Account).After appropriate notice to the Department, on January 17, 1984, the Courtgranted the motion of the Plan for approval of MSG as the Named Fiduciary.In accordance with the order, MSG assumed its responsibilities as the NamedFiduciary on January 20, 1984. MSG also entered into investment managementagreements with the investment managers who were already serving in suchcapacities. The agreements, which were effective as of January 20, 1984,required MSG to monitor the activities of all investment managers. MSG'sconduct in such regard continued to be subject to the review of the Trustees,the Independent Special Counsel, the Court and the Department.5. <T3>Existing Prohibited Transaction Exemptions. </T3>In 1977, the Departmentand the Service issued PTE 77-11, a nine-part exemption, that was designedto resolve a number of questions which arose, or which were they likelyto arise, with respect to prohibited transactions involving the managementof the Plan's assets under the 1977 Named Fiduciary Agreement and the variousindividual investment management agreements. In particular, Part VIII ofPTE 77-11 provided exemptive relief for the adjustment and/or continuationby investment managers of any pre-existing loan, lease, service agreementor other arrangement with a party in interest, or the continued holdingby the Plan of any pre-existing employer security or employer real propertyas those terms are defined in sections 407(d)(1) and (d)(2) of the Act.The exemption relieved the investment managers of the burden of investigatingwhether previously entered transactions constituted prohibited transactions,and allowed such managers to make investment decisions on behalf of thePlan. Part VIII of PTE 77-11 was also intended to cover the ``working-out''of a loan with a party in interest.On July 31, 1984, the Department issued PTE 84-114 which was effectiveJanuary 20, 1984, and which extended for up to one year several parts ofPTE 77-11, including Part VIII. This extension permitted the Plan's investmentmanagers to continue to manage the Plan's assets without a disruption inthe continuity of advise and services while MSG, as the new Named Fiduciary,performed in-depth reviews of the Plan's investments and investment policyand the managers' performance. PTE 84-114 also required MSG to have allinvestment managers and real estate investment managers document, in monthlyreports to MSG and the Trustees, all transactions occuring in the priormonth with parties in interest that involved certain real estate assetsof the Plan. Because PTE 84-114 would soon expire, MSG requested a further,five year extension of Parts V, VIII and IX of PTE 77-11. On December 30,1985, the Department issued PTE 85-211, effective as of January 1, 1985.However, PTE 85-211 was limited in its application, and may be relied uponto the extent that PTE 84-14 is not applicable solely by reason of an investmentmanager's failure to satisfy the assets under management test or the equityrequirements of PTE 84-14. PTE 85-211 also contained an identical reportingand disclosure provision.6. <T3>Transactions and Rationale for Amendments to Existing Exemptive Relief.</T3>MSG is concerned that PTE 84-14 may not be applicable to exempt transactionsbetween the Plan and the Central Conference of Teamsters (the Union), itlocals or other employee benefit plans sponsored in whole or in part bythe Union, because the Union may be considered to have the indirect powerto terminate MSG which, in turn, has the power to terminate the investmentmanagers.\2\<NOTE/> If PTE 84-14 is inapplicable for this reason, MSG believesPTE 85-211 would also be inapplicable. As a result, MSG represents thatcontinuing transactions (such as loans or leases) with the Union or itslocals which were exempted by Part VIII of PTE 77-11, may have become prohibitedtransactions as of January 1, 1985, when PTE 84-114 was superseded by PTE85-211.\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ MSG explains that the circumstances of the Plan, includingthe independence of its investment managers and the oversight of theiractivities are unique.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Although PTE 85-211 is effective from January 1, 1985until January 21, 1990, MSG represents that it has considered the amountof time that will be required to terminate the transactions that are subjectto the amendments and it believes a longer exemptive period is necessary.As described below, the transactions include the lease of office spaceto the Union and the Welfare Plan. The Union and the Welfare Plan willmove to new quarters, and it is anticipated that such move will occur by1990. However, MSG represents that construction delays or other not unusualproblems may delay the move past January 21, 1990, and has therefore requestedthat the effective date for the transactions subject to the amendmentsbe extended to January 21, 1992.MSG has identified three investments for which this concern exists:(a) Certain continuing leases of office space (the Leases) between thePlan as lessor the Union as lessee and between the Plan as lessor and theWelfare Plan as lessee \4\<NOTE/> in the International Tower Building, Chicago, Illinois. MSGexplains that Eastdil Advisers, Inc., the Plan's investment manager forthe Leases, is of the opinion that the Plan has always received fair marketvalue rent since the inception of such Leases.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ The Welfare Plan is a party in interest with respect toPlan because it is a contributing employer which respect to the Plan withinthe meaning of the section 3(14)(C) of the Act.           (b) A loan by the Plan (the Kansas City Loan) to the Teamsters' and TruckDrivers' Building Association (the Borrower) which consists of a numberof Union locals in the Kansas-Missouri area. MSG states that the KansasCity Loan is still outstanding.  (c) Two loans by the Plan (the Ohio Loans) to the Central Ohio TeamstersBuilding Co., Inc., a company formed by a Union local. According to MSG,the Ohio Loans were sold to an unrelated party on March 21, 1986.  MSG believes these investments may be regarded as prohibited transactions.In the case of the Leases and the Kansas City Loan, MSG explains that suchinvestments were no longer subject to a prohibited transaction exemptionafter January 1, 1985. Similarly, with respect to the Ohio Loans, MSG representsthat such Loans were not covered by an administrative exemption from January1, 1985 until the date of their sale to the unrelated party.  MSG submits that an unusual problem is presented by the potential dispositionof the Kansas City Loan. MSG states that effects to market the Kansas CityLoan by its investment manager have been unsuccessful primarily due tothe unattractness of the loan terms and the poor creditworthiness of theBorrower. Although the Borrower has offered to buy-out or work-out theKansas City Loan at an all cash, discounted price (which exceeds that offeredby any other potential bidder), and the investment manager believes thata sale of the Kansas City Loan to the Borrower would be in the best interestsof the Plan, MSG believes a sale of such loan to the Borrower may constitutea prohibited transaction that is not covered by either PTE 84-14 or PTE85-211.  7. <T3>Requested Amendments to Exemption. </T3>MSG requests that PTE 85-211be modified and made retroactively effective as of January 1, 1985 by amendingthe third paragraph thereof to read as follows (changes indicated):<ITAG tagnum="21">In addition, the restrictions of section 406(a) of the Act and thesanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code, bythe reason of sections 4975(c)(1) (A) through (D) of the Code, shall notapply, until January 21, 1992 to the following:  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(A) the adjustment, <T3>disposition, </T3>and/or continuation by investment managers of anypre-existing loan, lease, service agreement, or other arrangement, or theholding by the Plan of any pre-existing employer security or real property(as described in Part VIII of PTE 77-11 and PTE 84-114), but only to theextent that PTE 84-14 is not applicable with respect to such transactionsby reason of <T3>any of the following: </T3>(1) the assets of the Plan represent morethan 20 percent of the total client assets under the management of theinvestment manager at the time of the transaction; (2) the investment managerdoes not satisfy the definition contained in Part V(a)(4) of PTE 84-14;<T3>or (3) the transaction is between the Plan and the Welfare Plan, orthe transaction is between the Plan and a person which is a party in interestand at the time of the transaction [as defined in Part V(i) of PTE 84-14]either such party in interest or its ``affiliate'' [as defined in PartV(c) of PTE 84-14] has the authority or, during the preceding one year,has exercised the authority: (a) to appoint or terminate the Named Fiduciaryof the Plan or (b) to otherwise alter the terms under which a person servesas the Named Fiduciary of the Plan; and * * *</T3></ITAG>MSG states that the insertion of the word ``disposition'' in new subparagraph(A) is intended to clarify that no interpretation of ``adjustment'' ofa pre-existing ``arrangement'' would exclude from the coverage of the exemptiona negotiated termination of a pre-existing ``arrangement'' with a partyin interest, which termination involves a disposition to the party in interest.MSG explains that this change is intended to include, for example, thesale of the Kansas City Loan to the Borrower.  MSG also represents that the addition of clause (3) to subparagraph (A)would bring within the scope of PTE 85-211 certain additional transactions(as described above) that may not be covered by PTE 84-14. MSG believesthat such pre-existing transactions should not lose exemptive relief asof January 1, 1985, the effective date of PTE 85-211. MSG thinks that suchan effect would be detrimental to the interests of the participants andbeneficiaries of the Plan. Therefore, MSG requests the addition of newclause (3) in subparagraph (A), which would have the effect of clarifyingthat PTE 85-211 applies to these pre-existing transactions.  MSG states that the reference in new clause (3) to transactions betweenthe Plan and the Welfare Plan is intended to cover the lessor-lessee relationshipbetween such plans. MSG also states that the remainder of new clause (3)is meant to describe a class of persons who may have authority over theTrustees of the Plan such that, they might be thought to have indirectcontrol over MSG or even the Plan's investment managers. While such classof persons might be thought to be very broad, MSG explains that the effectof the new language would be to clairfy that exemptive relief is restoredto a finite number of pre-existing, previously exempt transactions.  MSG represents that any proposal to adjust, dispose of or continue anysuch investment will be brought to its immediate attention by the investmentmanager having responsibility over the investment. MSG says it has no difficultyin making this representation because at present, due to the sensitivitysurrounding such loans and leases to the Welfare Plan and other personsassociated with the Union, it requires that investment managers immediatelyinform MSG of any proposal to adjust, dispose of or contiue any such investment.MSG, in turn, summarizes such proposals in monthly reports delivered tothe Trustees at their monthly meeting with MSG. Copies of the reports arealso delivered to the Independent Special Counsel. Moreover, the IndependentSpecial Counsel (and/or his representatives) typically attends the monthlyTrustees' meeting. If the Independent Special Counsel were to perceiveany material problem in connection with any proposal, MSG resumes Mr. Saxbewould bring this matter to the attention of the Court in his quarterlyreport filed with the Court. Thus, MSG states it has already establisheda monitoring system whereby it and Mr. Saxbe are kept informed of any transactionswhich might fall within the purview of Part VIII of PTE 77-11 and PTE 84-114.MSG asserts further that if, in the course of undertaking its monitoringfunction it were to become aware of potential harm to the Plan in any ofthe transactions under discussion, or of an attempt for it or an investmentmanager to become unduly influenced in the negotiation of such transactions,it would have the responsibility to make certain such harm would not occurand that such influence would be resisted. Accordingly, MSG states thatit would take such reasonable and affirmative steps as were appropriateunder the circumstances. Such steps might include refusing to take certainrecommended actions; informing the Department or the Court of any wrongdoing;or, initiating litigation on behalf of the Plan.MSG also states that the investment managers it appoints may take similaractions in order to avoid conflicts of interest or other prohibited transactionswith respect to the above described investments. Depending upon the circumstances,MSG represents that the investment manager may refuse to undertake suggestedactions; apprise MSG, the Independent Special Counsel, the Department orthe Court of any wrongdoing; or commence litigation in the name of thePlan.8. <T3>Views of the Independent Special Counsel. </T3>By letter dated February16, 1987, Mr. Saxbe states that it is his understanding that the purposeof the requested relief is to provide that the exemption granted to MSGby PTE 84-114 and, as essentially extended through 1990 by PTE 85-211,will apply to a finite number of pre-existing, previously exempt transactions,which had been covered by PTE 84-114 and that might not be covered by PTE85-211 or any outstanding class exemption. Because of the continuing, uniquenature of the Plan's assets, the magnitude of those assests and the verylarge number of individuals who are parties in interest to the Plan, Mr.Saxbe represents that he is still of the view that the relief granted inPTE 84-114 and PTE 85-211 was in the best interest of the Plan and itsparticipants and beneficiaries. He also states that he believes the proposedamendments to a portion of PTE 85-211 would be in the best interest ofthe Plan and its participants and beneficiaries.9. In summary, it is represented that the proposed amendments to PTE 85-211satisfy the statutory requirements of section 408(a) of the Act because:(a) They ensure the continued, effective management of the Plan's assets;(b) they provide relief for a few, certain pre-existing transactions thathad previously been exempt but might not be covered by PTE 84-14 due tothe identities of the parties involved; (c) the amendments to PTE 85-211would be subject to the provisions relating to reporting and disclosurethat were previously imposed in PTE 84-114 and PTE 85-211 for identicalrelief; (d) MSG will continue to be responsible for monitoring the activitiesof investment managers, and its conduct will continue to be subject toreview by the Trustees, the Independent Special Counsel, the Court andthe Department; and (e) of the Independent Special Counsel believes theproposed amendments to PTE 85-211 are in the best interest of the Planand its participants and beneficiaries.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Ms. Jan D.

However there is jurisdictionunder Title II of the Act pursuant to section 4975 of the Code.Summaryof Facts and Representations1. The Plans are defined contribution plans with two participants, KarlR. Moedl, M.D. and his wife, Joan S. Moedl (the Moedls). As of September30, 1987, Karl R. Moedl, M.D. had an account balance of $484,334.37 inthe Profit Sharing Plan and account balance of $142,977.00 in the PensionPlan. As of the same date, September 30, 1987, Joan S. Moedl had an accountbalance of $55,203.63 in the Profit Sharing Plan and an account balanceof $13,673.00 in the Pension Plan. Karl R. Moedl, M.D., who is the soleshareholder of the Employer, is the trustee of the Plans. The Moedls, whoare the applicants, represent that all former participants in the Planshave received their vested and accrued benefits from the Plans at the timeof terminating their employment. The applicants also represent that thatMoedls will be the only participants at risk with respect to the Propertyand, at any time other persons become participants, their segregated accountsin the Plan will not be involved with the Property.2. The Property is a condominium with six rooms and three baths, unitsnumber C-203, located on Lua Kula Street, Waikbloa Villas I and II, Kamuela,Hawaii 96743. The Property has been appraised, as of July 15, 1987, tohave a fair market value of $158,000, by Mr. Bill M. Brodbeck II, M.A.I.of Sevco Real Estate Appraisers, Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, an independent appriaserwith no affiliations with the Plans or the Moedls.3. The Moedls have offered to sell the Property to the Plans for cash withan undivided 78 percent interest in the Property being acquired by theProfit Sharing Plan for $117,000 and an undivided 22 percent interest inthe Property being acquired by the Pension Plan for $33,000. Neither salescommissions nor fees of any kind will be paid by the Plans to any personin connection with the sale of the Property. The division of the interestsin the Property, as proposed in the purchase transaction, will involveless than 25 percent of the total assets of the Plans and their respectiveaccount balances. the applicants also represent that the Plan will leasethe Property to persons who are not parties in interest or disqualifiedpersons with respect to the Plan and at no time will the Moedls rent orotherwise use the Property themselves.4. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction satisfiesthe criteria of section 4975(c)(2) of the Code because (a) The purchaseprice of the Property will be approximately 21.68 percent of the Plans'total assets and the proportionate purchase prices of the Property willbe 21.69 percent of the Profit Sharing Plan's assets and 21 percent ofthe Pension Plan's assets; (b) the Plan will be paying less for the Propertythan the fair market value as determined by an independent appraiser; and(c) the Moedls are the only participants to be affected by the proposedtransaction and they desire that the transaction be consummated.<T3>Notice to Interested Persons: </T3>Since Karl R.

Dwyer, Jr., is thesole shareholder of John W. Dwyer, P.C., the Plans' sponsor, and is thePlans' sole participant. Hence, there is no jurisdiction under Title Iof the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (the Act) pursuantto 29 CFR 2510.3-3(b). However, there is jurisdiction under Title II ofthe Act pursuant to section 4975 of the Code. Summary of Facts and Representations1. The Plans are a money purchase pension plan (the Pension Plan) and aprofit sharing plan (the Profit Sharing Plan) whose sole participant isJohn W. Dwyer (Mr. Dwyer). The Plans' sponsor is John W. Dwyer, P.C., whichis engaged in the practice of lobbying and administrative law. As of November30, 1986, the Pension Plan had assets of $93,344 and the Profit SharingPlan has assets of $140,018.2. In December, 1986, the Plans purchased the Real Property, 440 acresof unimproved farm land located in McKenzie County, North Dakota, for $114,000in cash, from the estate of Dean Jacobson, an unrelated third party. ThePension Plan owns 40% of the Real Property, and Profit Sharing Plan owns60%. The purchase was made to earn rental income for the Plans. However,the applicant represents that farmland values in McKenzie County have beendecreasing rapidly, and the rent on the Real Property has not offset thedecrease in the value of the Real Property. At the present time the RealProperty is leased to Mr. Dwyer's brother for approximately $8,400 perannum. Property tax on the Real Property amounts to approximately $500per annum. 3. On May 11, 1987, Henry Skjelvik, a real estate broker doing businessas Skjelvik Agency in Watford City, North Dakota, estimated the fair marketvalue of the Real Property at $79,290. On May 22, 1987, Deborah Kahl, anappraiser with Badlands Appraisal Service in Watford City, North Dakota,estimated the fair market value of the Real Property at $81,400.4. Accordingly, the applicant proposes that the Plans sell the Real Propertyfor cash to John W. Dwyer, Sr., Mr. Dwyer's father, for the greater of$116,000, or the total expenditure by the Plans in connection with theiracquisition and holding of the Real Property, including, but not limitedto the price originally paid by the Plans, legal expenses, property tax,and insurance, provided that the sale price is no less than the fair marketvalue of the Real Property on the date of sale. 5. The applicant agrees to file Form 5330 and to pay all applicable excisetax due in connection with the existing lease of the Real Property by Mr.Dwyer's brother within sixty days of the publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of an exemption for the sale of the Real Property.6. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction willsatisfy the terms and conditions of section 4975(c)(2) of the Code because:(a) The Real Property will be sold for cash for the greater of $116,000or the total expenditure by the Plans in connection with their acquisitionand holding of the Real Property, but in no case less than the fair marketvalue of the Real Property as of the date of sale; (b) the proposed salerepresents a one-time transaction for cash which can be easily verified;(c) the proposed sale will not require the payment of commissions, fees,or other costs by the Plans; (d) the proposed transaction will enable thePlans to dispose of an asset which is dropping in value and which is notproducing income sufficient to offset its depreciating value; and (e) theapplicant believes that the proposed sale is in the best interest of thePlans. <T3>Notice to interested persons: </T3>Because Mr. Dwyer is the only participantin the Plans; it has been determined that there is no need to distributethe notice of pendency to interested persons.
