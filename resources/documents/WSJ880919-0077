(But) Mike Pence is running a campaign financed 100% by Hoosiers.&quot;    As pungent smoke rises from scores of slowly cooking chickens, the Republican candidate turns the usual political order upside down: He is accusing a Democrat of being too dependent on moneyed interests. His campaign shows how disenchanted some Republicans have become with a political action committee system that the 29-year-old lawyer calls &quot;sick&quot; and &quot;fundamentally wrong.&quot;    His incumbent opponent, Mr. Sharp, a subcommittee chairman on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, does raise substantial sums from PACs. He received nearly $69,000 in the first half of this year alone, much of it from business groups that formerly backed his fallen GOP challengers. PAC funds account for 57% of the election money he has raised during his House career.    A Pence campaign ad on Indianapolis television stations, reaching about 80% of the Second District's voters, shows a $1 million check from &quot;influence peddlers&quot; being made out to Mr. Sharp. The ad goes on to say that the challenger &quot;has refused to take even one cent from special-interest groups&quot; and will be &quot;nobody's congressman but yours.&quot;    Earlier, Mr. Pence got some publicity with a brass plaque commending Rep. Sharp for becoming the first Indiana congressman to reap a career total of $1 million from PACs. The dubious award still hangs on the wall of the Pence campaign office, unclaimed.    Skeptics, who are plentiful, say Mr. Pence makes a virtue of necessity. PAC money seems to have dried up this year for Republican challengers everywhere.    Business groups are becoming resigned to invulnerable incumbents and seem to heed the Democrats' claim that they are destined to continue to control the House for the rest of the century.    In another Indiana congressional district farther north, for example, freshman Democrat Jim Jontz collected a phenomenal $329,000 in PAC funds during his first 1 1/2 years in office. Most of the money came from labor unions and liberal groups. Meanwhile, business and conservative PACs gave less than $15,000 to his opponent, Patricia Williams, a well-known mainstream Republican who is director of the Kokomo Board of Realtors.    Even so, national Republican Party officials advised Mr. Pence against attacking PAC funds, if only because voters haven't showed much interest in the issue. In 1986, Republicans defeated a Democratic challenger, D.G. Martin of Charlotte, N.C., who campaigned on a platform similar to that of Mr. Pence, also against the advice of his party. &quot;One thing the guys from Washington told me was that people won't understand,&quot; Mr. Pence says.    But his own polling suggests that he might be able to peel off as much as 8% of Mr. Sharp's supporters if he can convince voters of his claim that the incumbent gets 80% of his donations from &quot;special-interest groups, labor unions, and out-of-state lobbyists, consultants and lawyers.&quot; That could provide the winning edge in a naturally Republican district where Mr. Sharp survived with only 53% of the vote in the Reagan landslides of 1980 and 1984.    Mr. Pence's anti-PAC stance was influenced by Philip Stern's &quot;The Best Congress Money Can Buy.&quot; The liberal philanthropist's book argues that it is just as bad for lawmakers to accept funds from lobbyists as for judges to take money from defendants.    Odds heavily favor Rep. Sharp, who has eight House staff employees working in three Indiana offices, sends four official mailings a year to all district voters and holds innumerable local meetings promoted by more official mailings. He also plans to spend between $350,000 and $400,000 on his campaign.    But Mr. Pence, a tireless campaigner who bicycled 261 miles through the district during the summer's blistering drought, shows enough promise that the National Republican Congressional Committee now has him slated for $56,000 in party financial aid, the legal maximum. Meanwhile he spends five to six hours a day asking potential donors for money. He is budgeting $400,000 for the campaign, including party aid.    He promises not to be a one-issue candidate. He attacks Mr. Sharp for failing to support the death penalty for drug dealers and deployment of a space-based anti-missile system, accuses him of voting on both sides of a wide range of issues and vows never to support a tax increase.    In contrast, Rep. Sharp, 46, is stressing his 14 years of seniority and his position as a respected congressional expert on energy legislation.    But what dominates so far is the issue of money from outsiders. &quot;Phil Sharp is going to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars from special-interest groups that couldn't even find Columbus {Ind.} on the map,&quot; he tells the hometown party faithful at a GOP pig roast.    Such attacks seem to unsettle Rep. Sharp. &quot;I think they're cheap,&quot; he says. &quot;What is the implied message? That there's corruption.&quot; He complains that Mr. Pence's donors include many businessmen who have given the legal maximum of $1,000 each. Local Democrats aren't so affluent, he says.    While his opponent campaigns, Mr. Sharp tends to House business. He discusses banking legislation one day over breakfast with the Indianapolis chapter of the realtors association and later, over lunch, with an Indiana Bankers Association delegation. Both groups long ago stopped giving money to Mr. Sharp's opponents and now give to him instead. &quot;He votes the way we want him to often enough that we support him,&quot; the bankers association's president, William H. King, says.
