<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-13-0999 </DOCNO><TEXT>Until recently, reflex sympathetic dystrophy was thought to be a diseasethat necessarily involved the bones, with significant, homogeneous orheterogeneous bone loss, and consistently increased uptake on bone scansusing technetium 99m diphosphonates. Actually, recent studies have focusedon the great variability of findings in this disease, which is alwaysresponsible for pain in one or more joints, due to vasomotor disordersoriginating in autonomic nervous system dysfuncion, and for a very broadspectrum of functional manifestations. Among the many clinical patternsfound in reflex sympathetic dystrophy, forms with ischemic manifestationsat onset, including hypothermia and decreased uptake on bone scans havebeen described. In some instances, the clinical picture is reminiscentof ischemic arterial disease. Although these cold-onset forms seem fairlyrare in adults, they appear to be more frequent than hot-onset formsin children. Decreased isotope uptake is found in more than 63% of reflexsympathetic dystrophies in children. As concerns course and management,these cold-onset forms are not very different from habitual forms. Decreasedisotope uptake shoul now be listed with increased uptake among the findingssuggestive of reflex sympathetic dystrophy, especially, through not exclusively,in young adults and above all children.</TEXT></DOC>
