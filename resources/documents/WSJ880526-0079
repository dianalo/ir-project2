Richmond, Va.-based CSX, a transportation and natural-resources company, said it would finance the purchase of the privately owned company by the railroad unions. The railroad would be owned and operated by Pandamp;LE's former employees as an independent line. But CSX said there are &quot;significant issues yet to be resolved.&quot;    Analysts said the innovative plan is important beyond the Pandamp;LE, a 180-mile line in western Pennsylvania. The proposed transaction is &quot;a major plus for the Pandamp;LE and it underscores CSX's continuing efforts to work with labor in a cooperative rather than a confrontational way,&quot; said Graeme Lidgerwood, an analyst at First Boston Inc.    Keeping a spirit of cooperation alive is especially vital to CSX. Last week the company said it hopes to resurrect a plan, rejected by a major rail union, to cut CSX's railroad work force by more than 10,000 jobs, or 25%, and share the savings with the remaining employees.    The acquisition proposal was agreed to by CSX and the Railway Labor Executives Association, which represents 19 railroad unions. The plan calls for a new company to purchase substantially all of Pandamp;LE's track and about 1,700 freight cars. The Pandamp;LE had a loss of $60 million in the past five years but remains important to CSX, which operates trains between Pittsburgh and New Castle, Pa., over a portion of the line under a trackage-rights agreement.    The plan could also help resolve a battle pitting rail management against labor over the fate of the Pandamp;LE and other regional railroads. Labor has fiercely resisted an accord reached last year to sell the Pandamp;LE to closely held Chicago West Pullman Co. for about $75 million, because that plan would have cut the Pandamp;LE's work force to 250 employees from 700 with only minimal severance benefits.    Last November, a federal district court in Pittsburgh blocked the sale to Chicago West Pullman. The decision, affirmed by an appeals court last month, forced the Pandamp;LE to negotiate with its rail unions over the effect the sale would have on its workers.    Railroad executives said the decision has since stalled sales of other marginal lines around the country. That's because the decision potentially reduces the labor savings that entrepreneurs believe are needed to breathe new life into light-density freight lines.    Chicago West Pullman declined to comment on the new proposal. A Pandamp;LE official said the proposal &quot;appears to be of sufficient magnitude&quot; to recommend that the railroad's creditors accept it.    The Pandamp;LE was one of the nation's most profitable carriers in the 1970s. But the railroad fell on hard times this decade because of the contraction of the steel industry in western Pennsylvania. A Pandamp;LE official said the carrier was also hurt by the 1980 deregulation of the rail industry, which allowed larger railroads to move traffic to their own lines.    The &quot;purpose of this transaction with the CSX is to protect as many jobs as we can,&quot; said Brian Freeman, financial adviser to the Railway Labor Executives Association and the architect of the acquisition plan, adding that the proposal will nevertheless call for substantial job reductions and changes in work rules.    CSX said implementation of the plan is subject to acceptance by local labor organizations and approval by the CSX board and the Interstate Commerce Commission. </TEXT></DOC>
