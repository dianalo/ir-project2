The Economic Strategy Institute, a think-tank advocating amore protective U.S. stance on trade, prepared the study tosupport legislation requiring closer government scrutiny ofsuch takeovers.</LP><TEXT>   The study said the Japanese haul includes investments in66 companies in computers, 41 in semiconductors, 27 inadvanced materials, 25 in semiconductor equipment, 23 intelecommunications, 12 in chemicals and 11 in aerospace. Thestudy didn't detail the size of the stakes, which range fromminority interests to total control. British, French andCanadian buyers trailed far behind the Japanese in pursuit ofsuch assets, with comparable investments in all categories ofonly 40, 17 and 10, respectively.   The institute's listing of 412 foreign investments --mostly in smaller and underfinanced companies -- since 1988is the most comprehensive one that's publicly available. TheCommittee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or CFIUS, afederal interagency panel that monitors such transactions,says it has taken notice of more than 530 of them. However,the panel has kept its reviews confidential.   Surprisingly, the most active Japanese company in the listisn't a large electronic conglomerate, but rather is KubotaLtd., better known to Americans as a manufacturer oftractors, vending machines and other low-tech products.However, Kubota has announced plans to diversify intoelectronics and to produce computer work stations.   Kubota's recent investments include Ardent Computer Corp.,Maxtor Corp., Maxoptix Corp. and MIPS Computer Systems Inc.,according to the study. The study also reports that NipponSteel Corp., Kobe Steel Ltd., Nippon Kokan K.K. and othermajor Japanese steelmakers intent on diversification havejoined the buying spree.   Two House members said they are introducing legislation totoughen government monitoring of such transactions. Rep. MelLevine (D. Calif.), one of the co-sponsors, said the billisn't &quot;aimed at any particular country.&quot;   Mr. Levine and his Republican ally, Rep. Frank Wolf ofVirginia, gave reporters copies of a separate report that wasprepared for the Pentagon's Defense Science Board but has yetto be officially released. While noting the beneficialeffects of certain foreign investments -- such as those ofHonda Motor Co., Hoechst A.G. and Ciba-Geigy Ltd. -- thePentagon report points to others that have resulted in lossof U.S. control of critical technologies.   Both the ESI and Pentagon reports recommend active effortsby the U.S. government to help struggling high-tech companiesfind new U.S. partners if their only other alternative is tobe bought up by foreigners.   The proposed legislation is intended to correct some ofthe shortcomings that the Economic Strategy Institute's studyfound in the CFIUS's monitoring of these transactions. Amongother things, the bill would transfer the committee'schairmanship from the Treasury Department to the CommerceDepartment, an agency more directly concerned with thecompetitiveness of U.S. industries. The bill also wouldrequire CFIUS to judge a potential foreign takeover in thebroad context of &quot;economic security&quot; as well as nationalsecurity. Currently, the panel confines its inquiries to thenarrower question of whether such takeovers would hinderdefense supplies.   Treasury officials have warned against tampering with theCFIUS process, claiming that it could hurt the &quot;inherentlyfragile&quot; investment climate. However, the Treasury hasindicated that it would support legislation to permanentlyauthorize the government's right to review such acquisitions.Under current law, such authority has to be renewedperiodically.   The Treasury also reports a sharp drop of acquisitionnotices involving foreign companies, including Japaneseparties, since the Persian Gulf conflict. Tokyo, mindful ofJapanese pacifist sentiments, has cautioned Japanesecompanies against buying defense-related U.S. concerns.</TEXT></DOC>
