It's the business ofproducing and selling milk.   Most of us dairy farmers are like entrepreneurseverywhere, in that we find there are times when we have tosqueeze hard to milk a net profit out of our investments.And, like anyone else, once we started depending ongovernment subsidies to do it, instead of on our ownresources, we developed a dependency hard to kick.</LP><TEXT>   In this dependency lies the greatest difference betweendairying and other industries, including the sectors ofagriculture that are not subsidized -- such as grape growing.When the economy is slow and marketing or weather conditionsadverse, Washington will be flooded with much more desperatecries from dairy farmers than from grape growers. Grapegrowers faced with a flooded market will review theirmarketing policies and then decide how many vineyards theycan afford to maintain. Dairymen faced with a negative marketwill turn to the one marketplace with its doors wide open --that of politics.   Dairy farmers are fond of noting that all they are askingfor is a &quot;fair&quot; price for their milk. Businessmen know thatthe only fair price for their product is one that convincestheir customers to buy.   Personally, I feel that milk is one of the best bargainsin food. I can try to convince our customers of this byforcing our price onto them by law. Or, I can choose themeans employed by the most successful of American industries:product research and development, advertising and offeringcompetitive prices.   We who milk the cows have limited say in marketing. Werarely retail our own product; pasteurizing and packagingmilk according to federal standards is much more suited tolarge processing plants than the average farm. Many of theseplants in turn deal with milk retailers (stores, restaurants,etc.) instead of directly with consumers. This means thereare two middlemen between farmer and consumer.   In the name of protecting us from predation by thesemiddlemen, an experiment was initiated during the New Dealyears in which federal and state departments would controlthe terms of milk transactions. This quickly became a game ofprivilege and politics, and the small farmers the New Dealpaternalized were the losers. Stifled competition means lazymarketing, and that hurts the milk producer.   The Commodity Credit Corporation, the arm of governmentthat buys up surplus milk, temporarily keeps our prices fromdropping in response to shoddy marketing. That's what wasgoing on behind the scenes in 1978 when milk prices were highenough to be the envy of every businessman. However, afterthe caves and warehouses got full of spoiling cheese andeverybody said &quot;that's enough]&quot; guess where we farmers wereleft? With prices sinking to rock bottom in a floodedmarketplace, of course.   The 1970s could be characterized as the Decade of the BlueSilos. With milk prices soaring and Farm Credit bankersliterally knocking on our doors to offer us bigger loans, whynot improve our status with a shiny, blue glass-coatedHarvestore the dealer says pays itself off by preserving thecow's feed better? After milk prices crashed, many farmersfound themselves the owners of $100,000 blue follies thatturned out too uneconomical to maintain.   Blue silos are just one symbol of the betrayal and theresulting bitterness that has arisen out of political pricingof milk. Many dairymen are too mistrustful of the industryeven to ask the government to withdraw its intervention. Somesay, solve our problems with supply management, or a systemof controlling milk production with quota allotments. Otherssay, just set prices higher.   But there's another voice arising out of the clamor -- onegenerally discounted in the halls of Washington and notthrilling enough to make news. It's the voice of dairymen whowant government out of milk marketing, out with every bit ofits complicated price supports, market orders, andsupply-control schemes. We're tired of scheming against ourcustomers, because successful businesses don't do that. We'veobserved the prosperity of the free sectors of agricultureand we want to be among them. We just want to be allowed toget down to business-the business of producing and sellingmilk.   ---   Ms. Lapp, her parents and siblings farm about 200 acresand milk 60 cows in Cassadaga, N.Y.
