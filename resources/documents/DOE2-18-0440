The addition of communication links means that remote interpretationof images is also possible. The Army Medical Imaging System uses stimulablephosphor screens, digital readout, a small computer, an optical digitaldata card device, and a DIN/PACS link. Up to 200 images can be storedin the computer hard disk for rapid recall and reading by the radiologist.The computer permits image processing, annotation, insertion of text,and control of the system. Each device contains an image storage RAMand communicates with the computer via the small computer systems interface.Data compression is used to reduce the required storage capacity andtransmission times of the 1-mB images. The credit card-size optical datacards replace film and can store 12 or more images. The data cards canbe read on an independent viewer. The research is supported by the U.S.Army Biomedical Research and Development Laboratory.</TEXT></DOC>
