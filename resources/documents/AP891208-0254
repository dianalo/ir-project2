The decision, on the opening day of a two-day summit in thishistoric city on the German border, paves the way for the communityto revise its founding treaty and adopt radical plans that wouldlead to a joint currency and European-wide central bank system.   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has been an outspokenopponent of the sweeping proposals to make major changes in the wayin which the nations conduct economic and monetary policies.   ``But we expected this,'' said a British official, demandinganonymity. ``It was a low-key discussion and a decision they wereperfectly entitled to take.''   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who had earlier appearedhesitant under French pressure for an early conference, sealed thedeal when he told his colleagues he would back the 1990 date.   ``Our essential position (is) that the community must advance,''he was quoted as saying by French presidential spokesman HubertVedrine.   ``We must now complete the work in a way that the Italianpresidency convokes and opens the inter-governmental conference inDecember 1990. We must take a decision in this sense today,'' Kohlwas quoted as saying.   Under the community's rotating presidency, Italy will hold thetop spot for the last six months of 1990.   Italy's prime minister, Guilio Andreotti, said, ``The conferencewill be convoked and opened in the second half (of 1990). ... Wedon't need to fix the exact date.'' His remarks were quoted byVedrine.   Treaty changes are needed to bring about monetary union under acentral bank and a single currency for the Community of 320 millionpeople.   But the issue is controversial with Britain opposing monetaryunion and arguing it is premature to discuss changing the treatywhen the EC has not decided on what monetary union means orinvolves.   West Germany urged today that the Community nations yield somenational sovereignty over economic policy to the 518-memberEuropean Parliament, now largely an advisory body.   British opposition to monetary union is based largely on PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher's reluctance to yield national politicalsovereignty to a community-wide body.   On the summit's eve, West Germany said it did not want to startthe treaty amendment talks in 1990 as French President FrancoisMitterrand is seeking.   However, France and West Germany appeared to have reached acompromise: to launch the conference formally in December 1990, butstipulating it would not start work until early 1991. Kohl hadwanted to defer the conference until after West German electionsscheduled for Dec. 9, 1990.   At the start of the summit, Enrique Baron, president of theEuropean Parliament urged the EC to expand his assembly's powers.   ``The European Parliament must be able to initiatelegislation,'' Baron, a Spanish socialist, told the EC leaders.   He also appealed for a quickening of West European integration.``We consider it necessary to accelerate the process of Europeanunification.''   Mrs. Thatcher, seeking to focus the summit on the EC's responseto the upheaval in Eastern Europe, was putting forward a new policypaper.   It envisages the Community devising relations of varyingcloseness with East European nations depending on how far eachadvances toward democracy, Thatcher aides said.   The EC is to become a barrier-free, single market at the end of1992.   The summit opened just days after U.S. President George Bushurged the West Europeans to accelerate integration and to act as a``magnet that draws the forces of reform forward in EasternEurope.''   The leaders were also debating a proposed Social Charter,setting out EC-wide labor union rights, wages and welfare after1992. Britain also opposes the charter, arguing that it willincrease production costs and unemployment and make the Communityless competitive.   The Social Charter would not be binding. But its adoption goesto the heart of the political controversy within the EC.</TEXT></DOC>
