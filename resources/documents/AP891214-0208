Scotland Yard said in a statement Wednesday that electroniccodes on the floppy disks labeled ``AIDS Information IntroductoryDiskette'' have destroyed information in at least 10 computers.   But the London newspaper The Independent today reported thatrumors in the computer world put the figure much higher.   Scotland Yard's Fraud Squad has launched an investigation afterreceiving reports of the disks from around Britain.   Among those reported to have received the disks are the LondonStock Exchange, British Telecommunications PLC, which runs most ofthe nation's telephone network, the Midland Bank, Lloyds Bank, theAustralia and New Zealand Bank in London, universities, hospitalsand public health laboratories.   The London newspaper The Guardian reported today that the diskscontain ``a Trojan Horse computer virus'' which attacksInternational Business Machines Personal Computers. IBM is one ofthe world's biggest makers of computers.   The paper said the Stock Exchange alone has around 2,000Personal Computers, of which 700 are linked into a network.   The Independent said computer systems in hospitals are amongthose damaged. It said the disks had also turned up in California,Belgium and Zimbabwe but gave no details where.   The British domestic news agency Press Association quoted anunnamed Health Education Authority spokesman as saying a contact inNorway also received one.   Police say a letter with the disks asks for a ``license fee'' ofeither $189 or $378, depending on the type of license, to be sentto an address in Panama.   But they say many of the disks were mailed in London's SouthKensington district.   The letter warns that if the money is not paid, the sender willuse program mechanisms to stop a computer functioning normally.   Computer companies said they believed addresses for receivingthe disks were obtained from PC Business World, a British weeklytrade paper on computing.   Joe Hirst, former technical editor of Virus Bulletin and aconsultant on computer software, told The Associated PressWednesday: ``There are two programs on the disk. The first is aninstallation program and the second is a questionnaire on the riskof AIDS which will not run unless it is installed on a hard disk.It then prints off an invoice for a company in Panama but thedamage has already been done by the installation.''   The alarm was first raised Tuesday by Dr. Alan Solomon, chairmanof the IBM Personal Computer User Group, who said he received oneof the disks on Monday.   At the Stock Exchange, an official, speaking anonymously, said:``You must be off your head if you get an unsolicited disk and putit in your machine.''   Police said PC Business World sold its 700-name mailing list ingood faith to someone claiming he wanted to publicize the export ofcomputers to Nigeria.   The Independent said the list was bought for a reported 800pounds, or $1,280, by a Kenyan businessman, E. Ketema.   ``The paper reported: ``Mr. Ketema had taken out a short-termsubscription with The Business Center in New Bond Street, London,to receive mail and telephone messages on his behalf while he wasin the country from Oct. 31 to Nov. 30. He described himself as anaccountant, but the center does not know his first name, nor doesit have a forwarding address.''   The paper said some computers where the disk is used could crashimmediately while in others the damage is delayed.   The Guardian said the letter with the disks says the moneydemanded should be sent to ``PC Cyborg Corporation'' at a boxnumber in Panama. But the paper quoted police as saying neither thecorporation nor the box number _ 87-17-44 _ exists.   The paper said an American computer software company, CyborgSystems, and its British subsidiary sent warnings to customersWednesday that it was not involved.   The Guardian said IBM's British office has sent one of the disksto its computer virus research group in the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
