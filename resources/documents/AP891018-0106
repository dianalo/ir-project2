The economy is awash in debt, making everyone constantly uneasy.Virtually any bad news can cause a sell-off. Friday was simply anaccident waiting to happen, and though Monday didn't bring more ofthe same, as many investors feared, the bulls have hardly run thebears out of town.   There are two messages in this, one urgent, the other onlyslightly less so.   The first is the need to improve regulation of the securitiesmarkets to prevent a panic from getting out of hand. Some measureshave been taken since the great plunge of '87, but not nearlyenough.   The second imperative: The indebtedness of business, governmentand the nation must finally be reduced.</TEXT><TEXT>   Oct. 11   The Times, Trenton, N.J., on states filling a policy vacuum:   Recently the federal government has displayed a new kind ofusefulness. It allows the states to lead when a policy vacuumexists at the federal level.   California, the state most plagued by auto-created air polution,required refiners to change the mix of gasoline ingredients toinhibit evaporation of unburned fuel. Acting on California'sexample, New Jersey, New York and the six New England statesjointly decided last year to do the same. This spring the U.S.Environmental Protection Agency said it would implement therequirement on a national basis.   The pattern now seems to be repeating itself in regard toanti-pollution equipment on automobiles.   The states are leading because the Reagan administration beat aretreat on clean-air policy and the Bush administration has actedonly tentatively to reverse it. Unless there is bolder federalaction on other environmental problems, many more such nationalcampaigns will be born in the state capitals.</TEXT><TEXT>   Oct. 12   Roswell (N.M.) Daily Record on clean air legislation:   If more evidence were needed that President Bush is laggingbehind Americans' strong support for stricter clean air rules, aHouse subcommittee has provided it by agreeing to extendCalifornia's tough auto emissions standards to the rest of thenation by 1996. ...   The House should regard the amended auto emissions measure as aminimum standard. Bipartisan support already has emerged in theSenate for even tougher anti-smog rules. The Senate version is, infact, better than its counterpart in the House.   The final legislative package, due on the president's desk byJan. 1, ought to reflect Americans' growing demand for cleaner airand their willingness to pay reasonably higher costs to achieve it.That's a message Bush needs to take to heart.</TEXT><TEXT>   Oct. 13   Argus Leader, Sioux Falls, S.D., on flag-burning:   Considering the social and budgetary problems confronting thenation, one would think that President Bush and members of Congresswould be too busy to waste time on the non-existent problem offlag-burning.   Think again.   It's been almost four months since the U.S. Supreme Court struck(down) flag-desecration laws in 48 states, plus a federal statute....   There has not been a rash of flag burnings since the June 21ruling. There has been some criticism of the decision. But,overall, many Americans seem to be coming to the understanding thatlaunching a legal attack on freedom of expression is an evengreater danger than flag desecration. ...   Rather than waste any more time on the flag issue, Congressought to recognize that the right to dissent is essential tofreedom. Trying to protect the flag with questionable laws andlong-shot amendments weakens rather than strengthens the freedomsthe flag symbolizes.</TEXT><TEXT>   Oct. 17   The Saginaw (Mich.) News on education in United States:   Just before the Gallup Poll turned up the latest evidence thatAmerican education fails to educate Americans, The New York Timespublished a pained account by a fiftyish journalist appalled at thevacant minds of her juniors.   She told of a reporter working on a music story who interviewedPierre Boulez, a famed composer and conductor, without theslightest inkling of his background.   She mentioned a radio producer who could not identify a``campy'' piece of theme music. The names of singer Dinah Shore andsongwriter Jerome Kern meant nothing.   Well, not everyone is going to keep in mind every factoid. Butwhen young professionals know so little about their own field,there should be no surprise when the Gallup Poll reports that afourth of students draw a blank on the date 1492, or that 42percent cannot come within a half-century of placing the Civil War....   The remedy is as simple as a new classroom focus: Elementaryfacts first _ then creativity. That would cost little compared tothe long-term price of sending educated fools out into the world.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
