Information on the {gamma}-decay of 55 bound levels wereobtained from the spectra. Eight transitions between bound levels wereobserved for the first time. J/sup {pi}/ = 2/sup +/ was assigned to thebound level at E/sub x/ = 6,25 MeV and the spin and parity of anothersix bound levels were restricted to two values. J/sup {pi}/ = 2;2/sup+/; 3/sup -/; 3/sup -/ were assigned to the resonances at E/sub p/ =741; 1106; 1226 and 1606 keV and the spins and/or parities of 13 resonanceswere restricted to two values from {gamma}-ray angular distributionsand strengths.</TEXT></DOC>
