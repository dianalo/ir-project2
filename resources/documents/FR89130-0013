Background</ITAG>On December 31, 1980, The Secretary of the Interior conditionally approvedthe New Mexico program. Information regarding the general background forthe New Mexico program, including the Secretary's findings, the dispositionof comments, and detailed explanation of the conditions of approval ofthe New Mexico program can be found in the December 31, 1980 <T4>Federal Register </T4>(45 FR 86459). Actions taken subsequent to theapproval of the New Mexico program are found in 30 CFR 931.12, 931.13,931.15, and 931.16.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Discussion of the Amendment</ITAG>In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(f), the Director ofOSMRE on June 9, 1987, notified New Mexico of certain changes necessaryto ensure that the approved regulatory program remained no less stringentthan SMCRA and no less effective than the revised Federal regulations concerningthe protection of cultural and historic resources.In response to one of the requirements of OSMRE's June 9, 1987, letter,New Mexico on September 1, 1988, submitted to OSMRE a proposed amendmentto Coal Surface Mining Commission (CSMC) Rule 80-1 (Administrative RecordNo. NM-441). The proposed amendment concerns written permit findings forcultural and historic resources.OSMRE announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the November 2, 1988,<T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 44202) and, in the same notice, openedthe public comment period and provided an opportunity for a public hearingon the substantive adequacy of the proposed amendment. The public commentperiod closed on December 2, 1988. The public hearing, scheduled for November28, 1988, was not held because no one requested an opportunity to testify.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Director's Findings</ITAG>The Director finds, in accordance with SMCRA and 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17,that the amendment submitted by New Mexico on September 1, 1988, meetsthe requirements of SMCRA and 30 CFR Chapter VII as discussed below. TheDirector is approving the rule with the provision that it be fully promulgatedin a form identical to that submitted to and reviewed by OSMRE and thepublic. New Mexico proposes to revise CSMC Rule 80-1, Section 11-19, toadd a new subsection (p). This new subsection would require the Directorof the New Mexico Mining and Minerals Division (MMD) to make a writtenpermit finding showing that he has taken into account the effect of theproposed permitting action on properties listed on and eligible for listingon the National Register of Historic Places. This finding would be supportedby inclusion of appropriate permit conditions or changes in the operationplan protecting historic resources, or documentation that no additionalprotective measures were necessary.Except for the inclusion of State-specific references, SCMC Rule 80-1-11-19(p)is identical to the corresponding Federal rule at 30 CFR 773.15(c)(11).Therefore, the Director finds that it is no less effective than the Federalrule.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments</ITAG>OSMRE did not receive any public comments in response to its November 2,1988,<T4> Federal Register</T4> notice, and it did not hold a public hearingbecause no one requested an opportunity to provide testimony.Pursuant to section 503(b) of SMCRA and the implementing regulations at30 CFR 732.17(h)(11), OSMRE solicited comments from various Federal agencieswith an actual or potential interest in the New Mexico program. In response,the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) requested that the word ``and'' bereplaced by the word ``or'' in the phase ``properties listed on and eligiblefor listing on the National Register of Historic Places.'' OSMRE did notpursue this comment with New Mexico because New Mexico's proposed ruleis identical to the Federal counterpart which will be interpreted in themanner desired by the BLM.Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(4), OSMRE solicited comments from the StateHistoric Preservation Officer (SHPO) and the Advisory Council on HistoricPreservation. The SHPO for New Mexico recommended that CSMC Rule 80-1-11-19reference the consultation conducted between the New Mexico SHPO and theMMD under their existing Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). OSMRE did notrequire that MMD revise its proposed rule because the Federal counterpartregulation contains no such requirement to reference SHPO/regulatory authorityMOU's. The fact that the proposed rule does not reference the MOU has noimpact on the existing MOU nor should it affect the continued coordinationand consultation by the SHPO and MMD on permitting matters concerning historicalproperties. Consultation with the SHPO is required by CSMC Rule 80-1-2-12(e).<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Director's Decision</ITAG>Based on the above finding, the Director is approving the proposed amendmentsubmitted by New Mexico on September 1, 1988. The Federal regulations at30 CFR Part 931 that codify decisions concerning the New Mexico programare being amended to implement this decision. This final rule is beingmade effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment processand to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with theFederal standards without undue delay. Consistency of State and Federalstandards is required by SMCRA.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Procedural Determinations</ITAG><T3>National Environmental Policy Act. </T3>The Secretary has determinedthat, pursuant to section 702(d) of SMCRA, 30 U.S.C. 1292(d), no environmentalimpact statement need be prepared on this rulemaking.<T3>Executive Order No. 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</T3>On July 12, 1984, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) granted OSMREan exemption from sections 3, 4, 7, and 8 of Executive Order 12291 foraction directly related to approval or conditional approval of State regulatoryprograms. Therefore, for this action, OSMRE is exempt from the requirementto prepare a regulatory impact analysis, and this action does not requireregulatory review by OMB.The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not havea significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entitiesunder the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>).This rule will not impose any new requirements; rather, it will ensurethat existing requirements established by SMCRA and the Federal rules wouldbe met by the State.<T3>Paperwork Reduction Act.</T3> This rule does not contain informationcollection requirements which require approval by the OMB, 44 U.S.C. 3507.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 30 CFR Part 931</ITAG>Coal mining, Intergovernmental relations, Surface mining, Underground mining.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: January 23, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Robert E.
