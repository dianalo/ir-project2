A nearly four-hour meeting over a proposal to cut oil exports inconjunction with independent producers broke up early today withoutany agreements, and leaders of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries said they would reconvene this evening.   They said no agreements had been reached.   Fernando Santos, the oil minister of Ecuador, told reporterslater that it was impossible to predict whether an accord could bereached, since ``there's a wide divergence'' of views among the 13OPEC members.   The oil ministers are considering a proposal from six non-OPECoil producers to cut both groups' exports by 5 percent in an effortto push OPEC oil prices back to $18 a barrel.   The non-OPEC group says it will cut its exports only if OPECdoes likewise.   But opinions differ sharply within the cartel over whetherfurther cutbacks are needed, and there are indications some members_ including influential Saudi Arabia _ favor enforcement ofexisting output quotas over new cuts.   World oil prices continued sliding early today as the OPECleaders struggled to resolve their differences.   On the European market, Brent crude oil from the North Sea wasdown 35 cents a barrel, at $16.80, at mid-afternoon after havinglost 30 cents on Thursday. The U.S. oil markets hadn't yet opened.   Traders said the declines reflected doubts that the oilministers' meeting would produce a concrete agreement on measuresdesigned to boost the oil market.   Prices have fallen this year because supplies have risen fasterthan demand.   Most OPEC crudes are selling for $16 a barrel or less, althoughoil traded in the West usually sells for more.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, June contracts for WestTexas Intermediate, the most widely traded U.S. crude, fell 29cents to $17.98 dollars a barrel on Thursday after dropping 33cents the day before. Prices on European markets fell about 30cents a barrel on Thursday.   Some industry analysts believe prices would rebound if OPECaccepted the non-OPEC offer. But others doubt that OPEC could agreeon reductions large enough to make a difference in the globalbalance of supply and demand.   OPEC's opening debate focused more on differing views of the oilmarket's supply and demand balance than on the merits of thenon-OPEC group's proposal, according to sources who spoke oncondition they not be identified by name or nationality.   In an apparent effort to bridge the gap in these views, the oilministers instructed a team of experts from each member country tomeet today to assess the present and near-term market balance.   Arturo Hernandez Grisanti, Venezuela's oil minister, toldreporters he was unhappy that time was being devoted to a meetingof experts, which he said only would highlight the differing viewsbetween OPEC countries.   ``This is, in some sense, a waste of time,'' he said.   Hernandez said one suggestion under consideration was to foregothe proposed export cuts in favor of recommitting the 13 members toexisting oil production quotas, which often are violated.   ``We know that several countries have been overproducing foryears,'' he said, without naming the countries.   ``...If we can have a full guarantee that these countries aregoing to abide by their quotas, that would improve the marketsituation. But I have a lot of doubt about that,'' he said.   Iran was alone among the OPEC members in stating its clearsupport for the non-OPEC offer. None have rejected it outright.   Hisham Nazer, the Saudi Arabian oil minister, declined to saywhether his country favored the non-OPEC proposal, made Wednesdayby Mexico, Egypt, China, Oman, Angola and Malaysia.   But Saudi King Fahd on Thursday bolstered the impression of manyindustry analysts that he would not accept any cuts in OPECproduction or exports. He said the cartel's main goal should be tostick to its existing production limits.   ``I believe prices will go up if we adhere to the output ceilingand convince non-OPEC producers of the feasibility of limitingtheir production,'' he said in an interview published by a Kuwaitinewspaper.   Bryan Jacoboski, who was observing the OPEC meeting for theinvestment firm PaineWebber Inc., said Fahd's statement was ``thereal nail in the coffin'' of expectations that the cartel wouldaccept the non-OPEC proposal.</TEXT></DOC>
