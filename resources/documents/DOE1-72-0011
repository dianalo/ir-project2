Since the finiteelement method enables the potential function to be represented at pointsthat may be anywhere in the area of interest, considerable saving canbe achieved in computer time for a given degree of accuracy by the useof this method. Hence, FEM is becoming increasingly popular in calculatingthe electric field for high voltage equipment design. A program was developedto compute the electric field in and around a HV bushing by FEM. Thedistribution of the field is shown.</TEXT></DOC>
