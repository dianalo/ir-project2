(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A two-hour disturbance involving 150 to 200inmates of the Essex County jail erupted just after a televisionnews show was broadcast depicting overcrowding at the jail.   Sheriff Charles Reardon told reporters ``there was a lot ofdestruction'' inside the jail. He said inmates had set small fires,pulled pipes off walls and knocked off railings. He said there was alot of water damage.   Reardon said overcrowding probably was a factor in thedisturbance. One inmate and one guard suffered minor injuries,authorities said.   A man who identified himself as inmate Michael Robitailletelephoned the Union-News newspaper in Springfield from the jail andsaid the violence began shortly after 8 p.m., after a segment onWCVB-TV's ``Chronicle'' series focused on conditions at the jail.   ``Chronicle'' producer Mark Mills said the program focused onovercrowding at the Salem jail as well as other elements of thetroubled criminal justice system, including overcrowded courts inBoston.   ``I don't think there was anything that was provocative,'' saidMills. ``(It was) a look at conditions that they live with everyday.''</TEXT></DOC>
