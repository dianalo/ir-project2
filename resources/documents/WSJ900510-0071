Apple has billed the product as &quot;the most dramatic advancein Macintosh software since 1984. Nevertheless the companytried to put a good face on the development, downplaying itseffect on pressure from competing systems such as MicrosoftCorp.'s Windows 3 product and others.</LP><TEXT>   The announcement came at a Macintosh developersconference, where developers were given early versions of theproduct to test.   &quot;We told everybody last year that we were going to shootfor late summer,&quot; said Jim Davis, director of systemssoftware marketing. &quot;What we're committing to now is the endof the year.&quot;   &quot;It's probably for the better,&quot; he said, because the delaywill give developers more time to test the limits of the newsystem, which incorporates new functions into the popularmachine, such as ease of access to large data bases.   &quot;Software is hard,&quot; Mr. Davis added. &quot;To get within fiveor six months {of a forecast} is pretty good.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
