A Labor Party official who requested anonymity said theleft-leaning party sees ``no need to stay in the government'' ifPrime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc does not agreeto the talks.   The two parties are divided over the Egyptian plan's insistenceon a U.S.-backed formula of trading occupied territory for peace.   In the occupied territories Friday, Arab reports said Israelisoldiers shot and killed two Palestinian youths, including a12-year-old. The army said soldiers did not open fire in the areawhere the child was killed.   A spokesman for Finance Minister Shimon Peres, the Labor Partyleader, said Egyptian Ambassador Mohammed Bassiouny on Fridayformally presented Israeli leaders with Egyptian President HosniMubarak's proposal.   Peres, Shamir, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of the Labor Partyand Foreign Minister Moshe Arens of Likud discussed the plan.   Israel radio reported they disagreed sharply about the proposals,which the Labor Party supports.   A major controversy is Mubarak's offer to sponsor peace talksbetween Israel and a 12-member Palestinian delegation, including twoArabs deported from the occupied territories. This is intended tosatisfy both Israel's demand to talk only to Palestinians from theterritories and the PLO's insistence that Palestinians living abroadbe included.   ``Deportees are not exactly outside Palestinians ... I would notbe quick to reject this possibility,'' Peres said in an interviewwith the English-language Jerusalem Post.   Israeli newspapers identified possible negotiators as deporteesMohammed Milhem, a former West Bank mayor, and Akram Haniyeh,formerly a newspaper editor in east Jerusalem, both senior PLOofficials.   The Likud bloc is balking about negotiating with the PLO, whichIsrael brands a terrorist organization.   ``We have closed the door to the PLO, so the Egyptians havedecided to push the PLO through the window,'' Likud legislatorEliyahu Ben Elissar told Israel radio.   Transport Minister Moshe Katzav, also of Likud, told the dailyYediot Ahronot that anyone who accepts the plan ``wants to break upthe national unity government.''   Shamir wants to resolve the deadlock before visits to the UnitedStates next week by Arens and Peres.   Peres, who leaves Saturday and is scheduled to meet PresidentBush, said in an interview published in Friday's Jerusalem Post thatthe U.S. role in promoting Egypt's proposal is crucial.   Palestinian sources in Tunisia said Friday the PLO centralcouncil will consider the Egyptian plan in mid-October.   In the West Bank city of Nablus, Palestinian reporters said TarekSaid Tuffah, 12, was killed by an army sniper during astone-throwing riot. An army spokesman said troops did not fire inthe area.   The spokesman said a patrol commander shot and killed a secondPalestinian when troops were attacked by youths throwing iron barsand cement blocks. Arab reporters said Ata Yunis, 18, was killed ina clash with troops during Tuffah's funeral.   Six other Palestinians were reported shot and wounded by the army.   In the Gaza Strip, masked Arab assailants hacked and seriouslywounded a 35-year-old woman accused of collaborating with Israel,Arab reports said.   Friday's deaths raised the toll to 570 Palestinians killed in the21-month-old uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bankand Gaza Strip. Forty Israelis have died, and 114 suspectedcollaborators have been killed by fellow Palestinians.</TEXT></DOC>
