He called for an international war on drug traffickers,terrorism and hostage-taking, and vowed to maintain U.S. supportfor an armed insurgency against the leftist government of Nicaragua.   He said the Sandinistas were pursuing ``the oldest, most corruptvice of all _ man's age-old will to power, his lust to control thelives and steal the freedoms of others.''   But with his presidency nearing an end, Reagan struck a mostlyphilosophical stance as he told the 43rd General Assembly sessionof 159 nations that civil wars and foreign occupations were givingway around the world.   Reagan said the trend was spurred by ``a new era inSoviet-American relations'' marked by the continuing withdrawal ofthe Red Army from Afghanistan and a treaty last year to abolishintermediate-range nuclear missiles.   He said U.S. and Soviet negotiators were making steady progresson another accord to sharply reduce long-range bombers, missilesand submarines. While completion of the pact this year was ``highlydoubtful,'' Reagan said, ``I can tell you a year from now (it) is apossibility, more than a possibility.''   On the conventional front, Reagan said East-West talks to reducenon-nuclear forces, tanks and other mobile weapons in Europe ``willbegin soon.''   The United States had demanded a Soviet commitment to give equalattention to human rights. Reagan met last week in Washington withSoviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.   Afterward, U.S. officials said the Soviets had promised torelease 27 additional political prisoners, to make changes in theiremigration procedures and to undertake other reforms. Reagan'sstatement indicated the human rights obstacle had been removed.   After the speech, Reagan met with Foreign Ministers Esmat AbdelMeguid of Egypt and Shimon Peres of Israel on prospects for peacein the Middle East.   Chatting with reporters during a picture-taking session, Reagansaid he had ``high hopes'' for release of the nine Americanhostages held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian forces.   ``But I'm superstitious about calling a no-hitter before thegame is over,'' Reagan said.   The former baseball broadcaster appeared to be referring to theprogressive release of French and West German hostages _ and beingreluctant to talk about it for fear of upsetting the situation.   But Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said ``there isno morsel of information that gives us reason to be more hopeful.''   In the session with Meguid and Peres, the president called the1979 peace treaty between their countries ``a monumentalachievement which has changed the face of the region.''   He said the U.S. goal was to move beyond it to an overallsettlement that took into account the ``legitimate rights'' ofPalestinian Arabs.   According to Israeli sources, who declined to be furtheridentified, Peres said that his government would not deal withArafat and the Palestine ration Organization so long as they wereinvolved in terrorism and violence and speak of trying to forceIsrael back to the partition lines set by the United Nations in1947.   Secretary of State George Shultz, meanwhile, said despiteelections in the United States and Israel in November the partiesshould keep working for negotiations since ``a vacuum is verydangerous.''   In other developments on a busy day in New York, Reagan:   _Met twice with U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellarto assess prospects of ending the Persian Gulf war. It was Reagan'sfirst meeting with Perez de Cuellar since the White House'sannouncement on Sept. 13 that the president was releasing $188million the United States had withheld from the organization toshow displeasure with U.N. budgetary and hiring practices.   _Scheduled a meeting with Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the formerruler of Cambodia, in Washington on Oct. 11. The purpose is tounderscore U.S. support for his forces as they compete with theKhmer Rouge to take control of the country from pro-Vietnamauthorities.   _Met with President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe to register U.S.resolve for successful completion of negotiations thatsimultaneously would withdraw Cuban troops from Angola and SouthAfrica from Namibia.   _Met with leaders of Persian Gulf countries after deciding toend the U.S. military convoy of U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti oil tankers.U.S. officials stressed American warships would remain in the gulfprepared to come to the aid of commercial ships under attack.   The president's speech was the most upbeat of the seven speecheshe has made before the world body.   From Angola to Cambodia, and in the Persian Gulf, where Perez deCuellar is trying to formalize a cease-fire to end the eight-yearwar between Iran and Iraq, prospects for peace are bright, Reagansaid.   Fitzwater said earlier Monday that Reagan had decided to end the14-month program of providing U.S. Navy escorts to re-flaggedKuwaiti oil tankers in the Persian Gulf, but he still wouldmaintain a naval presence there to aid threatened ships.   Fitzwater told reporters that Reagan acted ``after reviewing thecurrent cease-fire ... which has been in effect since August 20,and consulting with allies and friends in the region.''   In his speech, Reagan said, ``I stand at this podium, then, in amoment of hope _ hope not just for the peoples of the United Statesor the Soviet Union, but for all the peoples of the world.''   In arms control, he said, ``the logjam is broken'' by the ban onU.S. and Soviet intermediate-range missiles, progress toward aStrategic Arms Reduction Treaty and the onset of negotiationsbetween the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pacton conventional forces.   ``History teaches caution,'' Reagan said. But his speech wasupbeat, and he traced the improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations tothe first summit meeting he had held with Soviet leader Mikhail S.Gorbachev in Geneva nearly three years ago.   ``So if future generations do say of us that, in our time, peacecame closer, that we did bring about new seasons of truth andjustice, it will be cause for pride,'' Reagan said.</TEXT></DOC>
