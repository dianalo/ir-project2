This rule, which neither expands nor limitsthe provisions of the Export Administration Regulations (15 CFR 368-399),makes editorial clarifications that conform certain regulatory provisionsto recent regulatory amendments to the Commodity Control List, as outlinedbelow:(1) Supplement No. 1 to Part 373 of the Export Administration Regulationslists certain entries of the CCL that are excluded from certain speciallicense procedures. CCL entry 4590B is removed from the Supplement becausecommodities previously controlled by that entry are now part of ECCN 1565A.(2) Certain commodities previously controlled under ECCN 1529A are nowlisted in 1533A. At the time of the revision of 1533A, some language thatshould have been transferred from 1529A was inadvertently omitted. Thisrule adds the correct language to the latest 1533A revision.(3) For the sake of clarity, a note is added for ECCN 5999B, and the <T3>GFW Eligibility paragraph</T3> for ECCN 1565A is amended.(4) For the sake of clarity, a paragraph is amended for ECCNs 1354A and1129A to remove incorrect terminology. In addition, certain language inadvertentlyomitted from ECCNs 1502A and 1702A is added.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>This rule is effective May 13, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Patricia Muldonian, Office ofTechnology and Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration, Telephone:(202) 377-2440.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Rulemaking Requirements</ITAG>1. Because this rule concerns a foreign and military affairs function ofthe United States, it is not a rule or regulation within the meaning ofsection 1(a) of Executive Order 12291, and it is not subject to the requirementsof that Order. Accordingly, no preliminary or final Regulatory Impact Analysishas to be or will be prepared.2. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (EAA)(50 U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), includingthose requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunityfor public comment, and a delay in effective date. This rule is also exemptfrom these APA requirements because it involves a foreign and militaryaffairs function of the United States. Section 13(b) of the EAA does notrequire that this rule be published in proposed form because this ruledoes not impose a new control. Further, no other law requires that a noticeof proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given forthis rule. Accordingly, it is being issued in final form. However, as withother Department of Commerce rules, comments from the public are alwayswelcome. Comments should be submitted to Patricia Muldonian, Office ofTechnology and Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration, U.S. Departmentof Commerce, P.O. Box 273, Washington, DC 20044.3. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), or by any other law, undersections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysishas to be or will be prepared.4. This rule mentions a collection of information subject to the requirementsof the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). This collection has been approved by the Office of Managementand Budget under control number 0625-0001.5. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order12612.  <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 15 CFR Parts 373 and 399  </ITAG>Exports, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
