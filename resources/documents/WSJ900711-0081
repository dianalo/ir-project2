A weak image, poor organization and corporate warinesshave kept charitable contributions for conservation and theenvironment at less than 1% of all giving in the U.S.,officials say.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It's an enigma,&quot; says Jon Jensen, coordinator of theEnvironmental Grantmakers Association, which tries to findecologically minded donors. &quot;Almost any public survey saysthe environment is one of the top three or four issues onpeople's minds, but it doesn't seem to translate to theirpocketbooks.&quot;   Individual donors, who account for 84% of all giving,still don't seem to think of the environment as a charity.According to a 1988 study by Independent Sector, a publicinterest group, the average American household spends $375for religious charity and $50 for human services, but only $9for the environment.   Environmental groups take part of the blame. Prospectivedonors can be bewildered by the 10,000 hopelesslydecentralized groups competing for funds. And the groups relyon antiquated direct mail to core constituents instead ofbroadening solicitation to reach new converts. Also plaguingthe groups is the lingering belief &quot;that if you donate toenvironmental groups, they will help the spotted owl and hurtpeople,&quot; says Kalman Stein, director of the EnvironmentalFederation of America.   To fight this, Mr. Stein's organization -- a federation of23 environmental groups seeking to pool fund-raising efforts-- has expanded advertisements and started workplacecampaigns, like the United Way's, among federal and stateworkers. California companies Apple Computer, TandemComputers and Safeway recently agreed to participate.   Some would-be donors simply assume that Uncle Sam will paythe environmental tab. But William Reilly, director of theEnvironmental Protection Agency, says government fundingisn't likely to return to where it was before the Reagancuts. &quot;There are things you can't do without private-sectorhelp,&quot; he says. &quot;We've got to enlist these resources.&quot;   Private foundations, however, have been slow to fill thegap. Some, such as the Pew Charitable Trust and the MacArthurFoundation, are longtime givers to conservation causes.Another exception, the Pittsburgh-based Richard King MellonFoundation, last week announced a $21 million land gift tothe nation, calling on other foundations and businesses to dothe same. &quot;We are very hopeful others will join in,&quot; says thefoundation's president, Seward Prosser Mellon.   A few have. This year, the Nathan Cummings Foundation,with assets of $200 million, and the Surdna Foundation, withassets of $300 million, both in New York City, have adoptedenvironmental programs for the first time. A quarter of eachfund's grants will now go to the environment. The McKnightFoundation of Minneapolis, one of the nation's largestfoundations, this month will consider such a program.   Apparently, other foundations are also interested. At theCouncil on Foundations' annual meeting in April, theEnvironmental Grantmakers held a breakfast meeting in a roommade to hold 50. Some 200 foundation representatives crowdedin for the presentation.   &quot;For a long time environmentalists were an elite group ofmiddle class whites who couldn't get a broad enough base,&quot;says Virginia Hayes, president of the American Association ofFund-Raising Counsel. Now, she predicts, &quot;they've reachedcritical mass. They'll be on a funding ascendancy for manyyears.&quot;   Right now, though, most foundations still prefer theirtraditional causes -- education, health and the arts. A 1988study by the Foundation Center reported that only 3.6% offoundation money went to the environment. Many foundationsare reluctant to get mixed up in the movement's controversialpolitics. The Ford Foundation, for example, gives to drinkingwater projects in rural America and pollution-controlprojects in Eastern Europe but avoids items that say&quot;environment in capital letters,&quot; says program officer WalterCoward, insisting grant recipients consider jobs anddevelopment.   Businesses and their corporate foundations, meanwhile,give just 2% to 3% of their charity to the environment, theConference Board says. Though such donors have been givingmore recently, environmentalists suspect this is less adisplay of philanthropy than an effort to get activists toleave them alone.   The Amoco Foundation, for example, doubled its annualcontribution to the Nature Conservancy this year, partly inreply to public pressure on the oil industry after the ExxonValdez oil spill. The foundation also gave land to the NatureConservancy in Oklahoma, near an Amoco oil drilling site, tohelp ease local opposition.   When corporate donors do give, the money often goes toenvironmental law or research groups, which won't later showup with picket signs on the company's doorstep. Says FordMotor Co. Fund director Leo Brennan: &quot;You don't want to bekicked in the shins by the shoes you buy.&quot;   Sometimes, the company kicks back. In 1988, when the ArcoFoundation discovered that a longtime grant recipient hadstarted protesting Atlantic Richfield's oil exploration inthe Alaska National Wildlife Reserve, the foundation dumpedthe group.   To tap into more funds, such groups as the NatureConservancy use a nonconfrontational approach. They don'thassle companies about poor environmental records, and theydon't mind being used for corporate P.R.   Chevron gave the Nature Conservancy $7 million in waterrights on Colorado's Gunnison River, and then ran TV ads tobrag about it. Toyota gave the Conservancy three trucks andthen ran a print ad praising itself. And when Arco gave theconservancy 570 acres in Southern California, it hauled outfilm crews for an elaborate presentation.   Patrick Noonan, who started the beggars-can't-be-choosersprogram as head of the Nature Conservancy and who now leadsthe Conservation Fund, defends halfhearted corporate charity.&quot;They're going to give the money somewhere,&quot; he says. &quot;We'vegot a crisis, and we've got a need.&quot;   ---                   Where Americans Give                                                                                                                                                        AVERAGE                                PERCENTAGE OF  CONTRIBUTION   TYPE OF                       HOUSEHOLDS        PER   CHARITY                      CONTRIBUTING    HOUSEHOLD                                                                                                          Religion                          52.5%         $375   Human services                    23.9            50   Health                            23.9            31   Youth development                 18.5            16   Education                         15.1            44   Environment                       10.8             9   Arts, culture and humanities       8.0            21   Public and societal benefits       6.5            10   Private and community foundations  4.8             7   International                      4.2            12   Other                              1.3            10                                                                                                          Source: Giving and Volunteering in the United States, 1988Edition, by Independent Sector</TEXT></DOC>
