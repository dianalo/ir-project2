The Harvard plan calls for special political programmingon nine Sundays from Labor Day to the election; there wouldbe two televised debates between the major parties' nominees,a debate between the vice presidential nominees, five live&quot;conversations&quot; featuring the two presidential candidatesand, finally, concluding addresses on the same night by eachcandidate.</LP><TEXT>   The plan, called &quot;Nine Sundays,&quot; was drafted by JohnEllis, a former NBC News political producer and analyst whois also a nephew of President Bush. It recommends that thetelevised events take place on Sunday evenings, preferablyover the major television networks. The purpose, according toMr. Ellis's report, is to &quot;institutionalize a moresubstantive discussion of political issues in a way that doesnot penalize the networks financially, inhibit thecandidates' campaign flexibility or diminish the concerns ofvoters and reporters.&quot;   Developed in Harvard's Joan Shorenstein Barone Center onthe Press, Politics and Public Policy, the plan grows out ofgeneral uneasiness -- among scholars, journalists, politicalprofessionals and the public -- about the way presidentialcampaigns are being conducted.   &quot;A modern presidential campaign, in all of its parts,moves too fast, in too many directions, in too short a timefor there to be any orderly process through which thecandidates could and/or would address the major issues facingthe country,&quot; Mr. Ellis says in his report.   The plan's prospects depend on two sets of importantvariables -- the views of the two party nominees and thecalculations of network executives, who ultimately will haveto decide whether they want to air such programming ratherthan their regularly scheduled fare. Marvin Kalb, director ofthe Harvard center, said he received &quot;very favorable&quot;reactions in informal, preliminary discussions with networkexecutives.   Mr. Ellis argues that the Harvard plan might have businessappeal to financially strapped networks because suchpolitical programming is relatively cheap to produce.   The Harvard study envisions a much different style ofdebate, without the teams of interviewers and cheeringaudiences that have characterized recent presidentialdebates. Using a model developed in Canada, the Harvard groupsuggests placing the two candidates in a television studiowith a single moderator -- a prescription, according to thereport, for a series of debates &quot;marked by simplicity andsubstance.&quot;   In this format, the moderator merely would keep thediscussion moving rapidly and fairly. &quot;The simplicity itselfwould make for gripping television,&quot; according to the report.   The five separate &quot;conversations&quot; with the candidateswould be on subjects such as national security, the economyand national cultural issues.</TEXT></DOC>
