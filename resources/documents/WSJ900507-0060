But trade experts warned there's less to the change thanmeets the eye because the government is slapping high importduties on most products in order to protect its domesticindustry. Cars, for instance, will face import duties of 85%;once local taxes are added on, a foreign car will cost 215%of its original price, according to the National Associationof Auto Makers. Previously, the duty on cars was 65% -- butimporters also had to get an import license, which was almostnever granted.</LP><TEXT>   Moreover, government officials indicated that importswould only be allowed in a first phase within the limits ofBrazil's foreign-exchange reserves, which amounts to a formof quota. In addition, a number of products still remainfully shielded from foreign competition, including computers,arms and munitions, defoliants and &quot;habit-forming substances&quot;such as cigarettes.   Still, trade analysts welcomed the move as a step in theright direction. &quot;Getting into the tariff business ratherthan imposing non-tariff barriers is a big step,&quot; said adiplomat who follows trade matters.   Brazil's move is likely to be well received in Washington,which recently said it would remove Brazil from its list oftrade violators -- known as the Super 301 and Special 301provisions of the 1988 Trade Act -- but said it would keepthe country on a Priority Watch List while monitoring whethernewly installed president Fernando Collor de Mello's actsmatch his free-trade talk. Brazilian officials say they hopeto scrap all barriers and cut tariffs over the next twoyears.   Analysts noted that the announcement of Brazil's tradeliberalization coincided with Economics Minister ZeliaCardoso de Mello's departure for Washington to attend theInterim Committee meetings of the International Monetary Fundand the World Bank, and appear designed to gain financialbacking for the sweeping anti-inflation plan Mr. Collor hasimplemented. Brazil, whose $115 billion foreign debt is thedeveloping world's largest, is planning to resumenegotiations with its creditors within weeks.   Brazil has repeatedly come under fire from its tradingpartners for being one of the most protectionist countries inthe world. In a bid to develop its domestic industry, thethen-military government of General Ernesto Geisel in 1975issued a list of 4,000 items whose import was &quot;temporarilysuspended,&quot; running from perfume to automobiles. Although thelist has since been brought down to about 1,200 items, the&quot;temporary suspension&quot; has survived until now.   When he took office on March 15, Mr. Collor said thecountry's protectionist policies have made it lag behind itstrading partners in terms of technology, quality and cost,and vowed change. On his first full day in office, herepealed the list of prohibited imports, but the repeal wasmade inoperative by Brazil's failure to announce new importtariffs.   Friday's decision marks a first step in that direction bysetting tariffs on 308 goods, ranging from chemicals -- withtariffs going from 40% to 85% -- to such products as kitchenappliances and white goods (generally 60% tariffs), hi-fisand videos (85%), cars and trucks (85%) and toys (105%).   Government officials expect the trade measures to leadBrazil to import about $1 billion more than in 1989, when thecountry posted a trade surplus of $16 billion. Officials saythe trade liberalization has two aims: In the short-term,Economy Secretary Joao Maia told the business daily GazetaMercantil, imports will be a &quot;powerful instrument&quot; againstspeculative price rises and shortages of goods that havedoomed past Brazilian anti-inflation packages. And over thelonger term, he said, it will destroy the cartels thatdominate much of Brazilian industry and restrict competition.&quot;Whoever doesn't have international standards of price andquality must either change or die,&quot; he said.   Brazil's government will take a first step toward breakingup cartels by scrapping a law restricting the telephoneequipment market to the local subsidiaries of Telefon AB L.M.Ericsson of Sweden, Siemens AG of West Germany and NEC Corp.of Japan, officials say.   In 1978, the three had won the exclusive rights to install800,000 terminals in Brazil, but continued to dominate themarket after the contract was fulfilled, installing more thantwo million terminals at nearly twice the cost of theinternational market, according to Communications SecretaryJoel Rauber. The government also last week said it wasstudying how to attract more foreign auto makers to spurcompetition.</TEXT></DOC>
