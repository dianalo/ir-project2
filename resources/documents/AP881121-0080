(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   State legislators are asking University ofLouisville officials to reconsider banning smoking in some parts ofthe campus, and are threatening to cut the school's budget if theydon't.   The General Assembly's Tobacco Task Force, meeting Sunday, gavethe state university until Dec. 5 to change its proposed campussmoking policy. Kentucky is the nation's leading tobacco grower.   If the university doesn't back down, ``It'll open up theawfullest can of worms,'' said the Rep. Clay Crupper, chairman ofthe House Agriculture Committee.   Crupper said the legislature has the ultimate weapon: the budget.   The proposed policy _ disclosed last week and scheduled to takeeffect by the new year _ would prohibit smoking in common areas suchas stairwells, hallways and reception areas. Cafeterias would bedivided into smoking and non-smoking areas.   Dan Hall, a university administrator, told the legislators thatthe university is willing to ``rethink this provision and maybe havesomething more balanced.''   ``I'll take back to campus tomorrow what you've said,'' Hallsaid. ``I hear you loud and clear.''   He also said, ``The policy is not meant to be anti-tobacco oranti-smoking but to better balance the rights of smokers andnon-smokers on our campus.''   If the university doesn't back down, other committees _ includingthose dealing with agriculture, small businesses, and labor andindustry _ will take up the cause, Crupper said.   Crupper initially called on the task force to approve aresolution asking the university to back down. But he later agreedto give the university until the task force's Dec. 5 meeting torevise its policy.   The provision of the policy that most offended legislators Sundaynight was a clause that resolves otherwise irreconcilable conflictsbetween smokers and non-smokers in favor of the non-smoker.   Crupper said that if a restrictive policy is enacted at theUniversity of Louisville, it would spread to other stateuniversities.   Sen. Fred Bradley said, ``I'm concerned with the precedent itwould set and the impression it would give people.''   The state's total income from tobacco production in 1984 was $2.3billion, and that led to $126 million in taxes, according totask-force Chairman Rep. Donnie Gedling.</TEXT></DOC>
