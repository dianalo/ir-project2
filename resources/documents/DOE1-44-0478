As the crystals werecooled from the tetragonal growth phase the reciprocal lattice splitquadruply due to interchange of the orthorhombic a and b axes on a macroscopicscale and to microscopic twinning about (110) planes. Recording the diffractionpattern on a multidetector allowed some separation of the individualorthorhombic reflections. The intensity ratios of the individual reflectionsof some split peaks are shown to be particularly sensitive to the relativeoccupations of the oxygen sites in the plane between pairs of closestBa atoms, and confirm that the oxygen lies on just one site. Large thermalparameters are observed for the copper and oxygen atoms in the chainsof corner-linked CuO{sub 4} groups.</TEXT></DOC>
