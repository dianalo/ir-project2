For theforeseeable future, just as during the Persian Gulf war, nobody will pay muchheed to what the Democrats are saying.;   &quot;Politically, right now, Bush goesup like this,&quot; said Democratic Gov. Lawton Chiles of Florida, swooping hishand toward the ceiling at the National Governors Conference in Seattle. &quot;Theball goes back in his court, where his strength is.&quot;; CASTRO CAN'T EXPECT MUCHIN WAY OF AID; WASHINGTON -- The government of Cuban President Fidel Castrowill get a psychological boost, but perhaps little more, from the ouster ofhis reform-minded antagonist, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, foreignpolicy experts said Monday.;   At a time of growing frustration and wrenchingausterity in Cuba, the return of Soviet hard-liners to the Kremlin will lendmoral support to Castro and probably stymie U.S. efforts to force a wedgebetween Moscow and Havana, the analysts said.;   But despite an ideologicalkinship between Castro and the new Soviet leaders, Moscow is so burdened withits own economic problems and political tensions that it will be hard-pressedto lend decisive aid to Cuba's foundering economy.;   Castro will likelyportray Gorbachev's removal as proof of the failure of decentralizing economicreforms contained in perestroika and the political liberalization known asglasnost, analysts said.; YOUNG RUSSIANS FAVOR DEMOCRACY, POLL FINDS;WASHINGTON -- Two of five Russians said they favored a strong leader to solvetheir nation's problems, while a thin majority endorsed the democraticprocess, according to a Times Mirror opinion poll taken before Monday's coupby Soviet hard-liners in Moscow.;   But the 51 percent who chose democracyover authority in the May survey were mostly younger and better-educatedRussians living in Moscow, Leningrad and other major cities where streetdemonstrations could influence the eventual outcome of the putsch againstMikhail Gorbachev.;   The poll shows that the Russian people broadly supportedthe political and economic changes that have occurred in their country, eventhough they gave Gorbachev, the principal author of the changes, an approvalrating of only 27 percent.;   Few Russians saw a coup coming, the poll found.Fewer than one in five said they feared that political liberalization wouldstop or that political repression was coming. But most recognized thatinternal strife was a greater danger than a foreign threat, and they put civilwar highest on their agenda of fears after economic concerns.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mercury News Wire Services  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Seattle  </CITY><EDITION>  Home  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910820  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  10A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  462  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday, August 20, 199100233048,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
