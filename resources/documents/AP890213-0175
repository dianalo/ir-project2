That'sbecause he's a Christian and lives in east Beirut and the socialsecurity office is in west Beirut, the Moslem sector.   He is a victim of a bizarre political crisis in long-sufferingLebanon in which government institutions, including the army, havebeen split in two by rival Christian and Moslem Cabinets vying forpower.   The 64-year-old Helou, who has a heart ailment, has to rely onhis sons to pay for medicines for himself and his wife, who suffersfrom diabetes.   The power struggle threatens to cement the de facto partition ofLebanon.   Many of the country's estimated 4 million people, hardened by 14years of civil war, have taken this bureaucratic nightmare in theirstride, despite three weeks of bloody fighting between rival ShiiteMoslem factions in southern Lebanon.   But for thousands of people like Helou, it has made the dailystruggle for survival even more difficult.   State employees are still getting paid.   Lebanon still has gold reserves worth an estimated $2.5 billionstored at Fort Knox in Kentucky. But with foreign currency earningsdwindling, the central bank has turned to internal borrowing fromcommercial banks to supplement funds officials are able to collectin taxes, customs duties and other levies.   But pensioners like Helou have suffered. The social securitydepartment's board of directors has not been able to meet to endorsepension payments because Christian officials are afraid to cross thedividing Green Line into west Beirut.   Helou said in an interview: ``We need 30,000 Lebanese pounds($60) a month for medicines. I relied on my annual pension of 6million pounds ($12,000), but with two governments I can't get it.   ``Fortunately my sons are providing me with the medications forthe time being. But how long can this go on?''   The crisis began Sept. 22, when President Amin Gemayel's 6-yearterm ended without a successor being named.   Minutes before he stepped down, Gemayel named the commander ofthe Christian army, Gen. Michel Aoun, as the head of an interimmilitary Cabinet until a new president was elected.   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Syrian-backed Sunni Moslem,and other Moslem leaders refused to acknowledge Aoun.   The government lost its authority long ago and real politicalpower has rested with the heavily armed militias on both sides andtheir foreign allies, such as Syria and Israel.   Yet government departments handling social and economic matterscontinued to function after a fashion, just enough to maintain asemblance of normality. Now even that slender thread is in jeopardy.   Ghassan Bitar, a Christian municipal employee, said he and hiscolleagues have not been paid since September.   Bitar, 32, who has two children and a wife five months pregnant,said he had to turn his family Mercedes-Benz into a taxi to makeends meet.   ``I can't leave my family hungry,'' he said.   Rana Shehab's dreams of going to London to study medicine wereshattered when the Education Ministry refused to issue her highschool graduation certificate.   ``Going to London's impossible now,'' said Ms. Shehab, an18-year-old Moslem. ``The only alternative was to enroll in theAmerican University of Beirut.''   The university, which once was the most prestigious educationcenter in the Middle East, is now a shadow of that since its foreignprofessors were frightened off by a wave of kidnappings of itsAmerican and British lecturers and administrators.   But Ms. Shehab noted: ``It's better than nothing.''   An Education Ministry official, Sami Hamadi, said the authoritiesdecided not to issue certificates for students in either west oreast Beirut ``until the government is reunited.''   Even getting in and out of Lebanon has become a problem for somepeople.   ``Airport officials turned me back when they saw my passport wasrenewed in east Beirut,'' said Anis Saeed, a Christian, when hetried to leave through the airport in west Beirut.   ``I got my ticket refunded and now I'm going to take the ferry toCyprus from the Christian port of Jounieh,'' said Saeed, 24.   The Lebanese have learned how to survive under the most arduousconditions during the civil war, Israel's invasion in 1982 andendless factional feuding. But the cloning of what had passed fortheir government has exasperated many.   ``We're fed up,'' said Amal Hamdi, 28, a secretary in westBeirut. ``We want this chaos to end. However, if formal partitioningwould lead to security, stability and better living conditions, letit be.''   ``Let's either have formal partition or elect a new president,but let's finish and know where we stand,'' said Pierre Ayyoub, 36,who works at an east Beirut trading company.   Every government ministry now has two competing heads. The40,000-man army, the police and municipal departments are similarlysplit in two.   The only institution that has remained intact is the centralbank, which is financing both governments. It is in west Beirut.   Mohammed Hout, economic adviser to bank governor Edmond Naim,said the bank's main objectivick pay.   A recent study by the Swedish Employer's Association said theaverage Swedish worker in industry missed 27 days a year for illnessin 1987, compared with 18 days in West Germany, 16 in France and 11in Britain.   A recent opinion poll indicated that 86 percent of thosequestioned suspected their colleagues of cheating. Officialstatistics show that sick pay costs have increased by 50 percentover the past three years.   Sweden's sick pay plan has traditionally been based on the honorsystem. Under a 1987 reform, blue-collar workers joined other wageearners in being entitled to 90 percent of their pay when they areoff sick, starting from the first day they stay home.   The government handles the payments, but most of the money comesfrom taxes paid by employers.   In the Swedish system, an employee who is ill calls his SocialInsurance Office and later signs a form stating the nature of theillness. A doctor's certificate is required only if the worker ishome for a week or more.   One form of abuse is simply for an employee to call in sick whenhe's not. However, authorities say it's even more common for workersto file for sick pay and go to work anyway, getting sick pay inaddition to regular pay. It's difficult to check.   ``If I knock on the door and nobody opens, what is my proof?''Yvonne Stroberg, a local official, said recently on Swedishtelevision. She suggested more telephone checks with employersrather than home visits by inspectors.   The National Accounting Board described another scheme in areport late last year. It said some people collect payments for sickleave, parental leave and student grants for the same period.   Karl Gustaf Scherer, director of the National Social InsuranceBoard, said on television his organization would increase itssupervision.   In Bandhagen, south of Stockholm, the local office started athree-week campaign to check all claims on certain days.   Sick leave, pensions and various other social benefits areexpected to cost 20 percent of the gross national product this year.   Illness benefits last year amounted to $5 billion, $120 millionmore than Sweden paid for defense.   One option under study is to let employers take over sickpayments for those absent from work up to two weeks, saving thegovernment money and paperwork. The employer would then claim arefund from the authorities.   Unions have opposed the plan. Margareta Svensson at theblue-collar General Confederation of Unions said it would permitemployers to put pressure on employees.   ``There would be people who would not dare to be (off) ill iftheir employer controlled'' sick payments, she said.   Since benefits are administered locally, there is no officialoverall picture of cheating nationwide.   A random check by insurance offices in the west coast town ofHalmstad indicated 20 percent of all sick claims were false, and thefigure was 15 percent in neighboring Varberg, Svenska Dagbladet said.   Another study reported by the Dagens Nyheter newspaper said athree-day check of claimants in the northern province of Jamtlandshowed all 180 cases were valid.   The National Accounting Board's report said illness claims, validor not, varied strongly by location. The 10 districts with thehighest absenteeism were low-income suburbs of Sweden's threelargest cities.   The head of the Social Insurance Office in Rinkeby, a Stockholmsuburb inhabited mostly by immigrants, topped the list, with anabsentee rate almost twice as high as the national average.   ``People out here have heavy, monotonous, dangerous and boringjobs,'' said Gun Britt Johansson, head of Rinkeby's social insuranceoffice.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Tue AMs, Feb. 21</NOTE></DOC>
