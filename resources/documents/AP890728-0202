Scientists say they hope to start an expanded second phase oftests this fall and perhaps have the drug available for wide usenext year.   Phase I trials, described in a report published today in thejournal Science, showed that the drug, called DDI, controlled thegrowth of the AIDS virus and enabled patients to gain weight, feelbetter and develop some resistance to infection.   ``This is not a cure for AIDS,'' said Dr. Robert Yarchoan, aNational Cancer Institute researcher who helped direct the Phase Itrials. ``But it appears to control the disease.''</TEXT><DATELINE>BAR HARBOR, Maine (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Researchers have isolated fetal cellsfrom pregnant women's bloodstreams, suggesting it should bepossible to diagnose genetic disorders in a fetus simply by takinga blood sample from the mother.   If the preliminary finding of fetal cells in mother'sbloodstreams is confirmed, it should be possible to do the samekind of genetic tests on those fetal cells as are now done on fetaltissue samples obtained through amniocentesis. That procedureinvolves the withdrawal of some of the fluid surrounding the fetus.   Making the diagnosis from a blood sample would eliminate thesmall risk associated with amniocentesis, the researchers said.   The method, however, cannot be used to screen for Down'ssyndrome and other disorders in which the chromosomes must beexamined under a microscope, because the fetal cells isolated fromthe mother's bloodstream do not allow chromosome diagnosis.</TEXT><DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J.

Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said late Thursdaythat Lucas, nominated as assistant attorney general for civilrights, denied urging the government to drop a housingdiscrimination suit against the city of Birmingham, Mich.   The allegation was contained in a letter to the Senate JudiciaryCommittee from Michael Sussman, a former Justice Department civilrights lawyer who now represents black plaintiffs in the landmarkdesegregation case against Yonkers, N.Y.   ``This kind of a last-minute tactic is reprehensible fromsomebody who is certainly aware of the system to raise an issuewithout any substance at all at this point,'' Runkel said, callingSussman ``a disgruntled former employee of the department.''</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democrats and Republicans are heading for ashowdown on the Senate floor over a compromise landmark savings andloan bailout bill that would balloon the federal budget deficit.   A House-Senate conference committee, finishing its work with twomarathon sessions lasting late into the evening, decided Thursdaynight to reject Bush's complex plan to exclude $50 billion inrescue spending from the deficit.   The agreement sends the legislation to the full House and Senatefor votes next week. However, the Bush administration has raisedobjections and senators warned that Republicans could block theplan in the Senate.   Nearly six months ago, Bush asked Congress for emergency actionto close or rescue hundreds of failed, but still-operating, savingsinstitutions.</TEXT></DOC>
