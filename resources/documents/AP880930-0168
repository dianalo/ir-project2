U.S. District Judge Lucius Bunton said the 311 Hispanic agentswho sued the FBI ``demonstrated a pattern and practice ofdiscrimination relating to conditions of employment andpromotions.''   Bunton said the issue of damages will be decided in laterhearings, possibly beginning in late November.   Attorneys for the agents said the decision could changeemployment practices in government and private industry.   ``The decision says discrimination exists in the Department ofJustice. If it exists there, it does in other places,'' said lawyerHugo Rodriguez.   ``It's a landmark decision because discrimination againstHispanics is pervasive,'' said Antonio Silva, another plaintifflawyer.   An FBI spokesman said a bureau response would be issued laterFriday.   The Hispanic agents won nearly all the points they set forth,but the judge said they did not prove the FBI retaliated againstthem for their involvement in the suit. Bunton, said, however,there was evidence the bureau retaliated against the leadplaintiff, Bernardo M. Perez.   Perez, the No. 2 man in the El Paso FBI office, filed the suitin January 1987, alleging the FBI discriminates against Hispanicsin promotion, discipline and assignments. He asked for $5 millionin damages and changes in FBI policies.   ``Until I read the document, I was very apprehensive,'' Perezsaid. ``I am very pleased. I am very happy. Justice does prevail inthe United States of America.''   The FBI has 9,574 agents of which 437 or 4.5 percent areHispanic. Hispanics make up about 8 percent of the general U.S.population.   During a two-week non-jury trial in August, about 30 agentstestified that Hispanic agents are given less-desirableassignments, are afforded less recognition for their successes andare not promoted as quickly as non-Hispanics.   The FBI rebutted those claims with testimony from the threeagents who work directly under FBI Director William Sessions, otherwitnesses and statistical evidence.   In his 98-page opinion, Bunton said he agreed with the Hispanicagents' claims that they were usually sent to listen toSpanish-language wiretaps, even if there were non-Hispanic agentsavailable who understood Spanish better.   Noting that wiretaps are a hardship because of long shifts,cramped quarters and long stays away from home, Bunton wrote:``Hispanic agents suffer disparate treatment in the conditions oftheir employment; and ... these conditions affect their promotionalopportunities in an adverse manner.''   Bunton agreed with the plaintiffs' allegations that Hispanicagents often are called off major cases to work on lesser caseswhere they can use their Spanish-speaking ability, then are deniedcredit for work on the cases they were taken away from.   Bunton wrote that he understood the FBI needs Spanish-speakingagents, but that the need for such agents does not ``justifybenefit and promotion systems which do not reward Hispanic agentsin a manner commensurate with their admitted contribution to thebureau.''   At news conference Friday afternoon, Rodriguez said Hispanicemployees from several government agencies and private corporationshave contacted him, seeking advice about alleged discrimination.</TEXT></DOC>
