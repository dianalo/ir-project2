The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, in a report on the Marchbalance sheets of the 3,120 Sandamp;Ls it oversees, said Wednesday thatone institution in Texas accounted for roughly half of theindustry's decline in capital of $2.4 billion.   Bank board spokesman William Fulwider said the agency haddecided not to identify the institution by name, explaining, ``It'snot a public institution and it has not filed its report yet forthe period.''   Nearly all of the remaining capital declines were also in theSouthwest, where the economy is hard hit by depressed oil and realestate prices, the bank board said.   The biggest Sandamp;L bailout ever was the $1.3 billion rescue inSeptember of Vernon Savings and Loan Association in Dallas. If theunidentified Texas institution has posted losses in months beforeMarch, its bailout likely would top the Vernon rescue.   The impending rescue of California-based Financial Corp. ofAmerica, which owns the largest Sandamp;L in the nation, also is likelyto surpass the Vernon figure.   The bank board said the industry's capital declined by $3.3billion in the first quarter, compared with an increase of $548million in the first quarter of 1987.   The figures indicate that the industry, which suffered its worstloss since the Great Depression last year at $6.8 billion, is infor another bad year.   ``Those are terrible numbers,'' said Bert Ely, an Alexandria,Va., financial institutions analyst. ``What's really concerning is... that annualizes out to a $12 billion to $13 billion loss forthe year, which is roughly double what the industry showed in1987.''   An institution's capital represents the amount of money leftover after its assets are sold and its deposits and debts are paidoff.   As the number of insolvent Sandamp;Ls has soared during the 1980s, theindustry's capital-to-assets ratio _ a key measure of health _ hasdwindled from 4.51 percent at the end of 1986 to 4.12 percent atthe end of last year. It plummeted again in the first three monthsof this year to 3.44 percent.   ``You're seeing a rate of decline ... that would exhaust theindustry's capital in about 3{ years,'' Ely said. ``The losers inthe industry, the insolvent thrifts, are just sinking much fasterthan the healthy thrifts can pull them out of it.''   The report lends new credence to arguments that the FederalSavings and Loan Insurance Corp. does not have enough money toresolve the problems of the more than 500 insolvent institutionsand that taxpayers' money may be needed.   Congress, in passing legislation last August, pledged to standbehind the insurance fund.   Bank board chairman M. Danny Wall said it is too soon to tellwhether the $20 billion available over the next three years will beenough.   However, bank board officials said last month that an audit ofthe insurance fund, which backs deposits up to $100,000, showedthat its liabilities exceeded its assets by $11.6 billion at theend of 1987, up from $6.3 billion at the end of 1986.   An audit report due this month from the congressional GeneralAccounting Office is expected to show an even larger deficit at theend of 1987 and some analysts say the insurance fund may eventuallybe $30 billion to $60 billion in the hole.   The March decline at the single Texas thrift alone accounts fora fifth of the money _ $6 billion _ that the bank board isallotting to clean up Southwest institutions.   The industry's earnings prospects, at least in the next fewmonths, look dim, Ely said, because interest rates on whatinstitutions pay for funds are rising faster than the rate theyearn on their loan portfolios.   One bright spot in the bank board report is the sixthconsecutive monthly increase in deposits in March. Deposits flowedinto savings institutions during the first three months of 1988 atthe fastest rate since the fourth quarter of 1984.   The bank board said net deposits increased by $4.5 billion inMarch, bringing net deposits for the first quarter of this year to$15.2 billion.   That compares with net withdrawals of $5 billion in March 1987and $8.2 billion for the first three months of 1987.   The industry, until the October stock market crash, had beensuffering a drain of deposits in what analysts labeled aslow-motion run. However, that trend reversed as investors pulledtheir money from the volatile stock market and sought the relativesafety of government-insured Sandamp;L accounts. Since then, an increasein Americans' savings rate has helped keep the deposits coming.</TEXT></DOC>
