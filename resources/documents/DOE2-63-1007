This is due in large part to the size and lead times of centralstation power plants, and to the need to anticipate the transmissionand distribution systems to support community growth. The strategic importanceof electricity to the national economy, rising capital costs of generatingplants, wider availability of energy efficient technologies, and greaterchoices of fuel suppliers have made electricity planning an importanttopic of public scrutiny. Traditional electric utility planning has consistedlargely of matching expected customer load growth with the right kindof ``supply-side'' generating capacity or energy purchases. In recentyears there has been emergence of interest in planning methods whichfocus on alternatives to supply-side options. Two such approaches, Least-CostPlanning and Demand-Side Management (DSM), both address opportunitiesto modify the ways in which energy (especially electricity) is used toreduce the need for new generation sources. The term least-cost planningis sometimes used to describe the idea of balancing the mix of supply-sideand demand-site alternatives to meet society's energy needs at the ``least-cost.''A more descriptive and accurate term for this balancing is IntegratedResource Planning. 13 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
