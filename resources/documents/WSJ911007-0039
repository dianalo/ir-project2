U.S. officials filed their first criminal complaint in thecase late last week. The action follows charges in Britainagainst nearly two dozen people and moves by Nigerianauthorities to prosecute the scheme's alleged perpetratorsand warn prospective victims.</LP><TEXT>   Since it started two years ago, as many as one millionbusinesses in the U.S., Europe, Asia and South America arebelieved to have received letters from Nigeria inviting themto join in the scheme. Would-be participants are typicallypromised a one-third cut of &quot;excess&quot; government funds rangingup to $50 million in exchange for help in transferring themoney from Nigeria into foreign accounts.   The fraudulent nature of the plan is so readily apparent-- and the offer so poorly written -- that most recipientshave simply ignored the letters. But some, enticed byofficial-looking documents and in some cases meetings inNigerian government buildings with supposed Nigerianofficials, have been lured into the plot. Those who follow itthrough end up as victims when, just as they believe they areto receive their due, they are persuaded to put forward a2.5% &quot;tax,&quot; or cash for expenses or last-minute bribes --money they never see again.   How many businesses have fallen for the scam is unclear,partly because investigations in several countries --including dozens at the federal and state level in the U.S.-- haven't been coordinated. And despite their losses, manyvictims won't come forward for fear of self-incrimination.But officials say that at least 40 businesses in the U.S. anda similar number in Britain are known to have lost funds inthe scheme. In most cases, the losses have ranged from$250,000 to $1.1 million for each company.   In all, the scheme is estimated to have netted itsperpetrators $150 million to $200 million from severalhundred companies, said Jack Kitchen, a British detectiveinspector who has spent two years on the case.   In the first such action against the operation in theU.S., the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan said lateFriday that an arrest warrant had been issued for PrinceChurchill Ovu, who was charged in a four-count complaint withdefrauding a New York businessman of $444,000. Thebusinessman, who wasn't identified, had advanced the money asa &quot;project tax&quot; to help release $18.6 million from the&quot;Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation.&quot; He was promised a30% cut.   The U.S. attorney's office termed Mr. Ovu a fugitive butdeclined to describe him further. Mr. Ovu is believed toreside in Nigeria and is the subject of extradition efforts,officials familar with the case said. While the businessmanwho came forward wasn't currently a target of prosecution,they said, others in the U.S. who assisted Nigerians with thescheme face possible charges.   The U.S. Postal Service, the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation and the Commerce and State departments areamong agencies that in recent months have issued warnings tobusinesses or launched investigations into the scheme afterreceiving hundreds of inquiries from companies that weresolicited.   Two major U.S. banks, Bankers Trust Co. and ChaseManhattan Bank, have also become ensnared in the case. Theirnames have been used in faked documents to try to lendlegitimacy to the purported transactions. Both banks saidthey hadn't suffered any losses.   Partly in response to pressure from foreign governments,Nigerian authorities lately have shown increased concernabout the scheme. The Central Bank of Nigeria issued warningsto businesses two weeks ago, and the government has startedto arrest suspected organizers of the fraud and to tightensecurity in government offices that may have been used by theplotters, said Richard Uku, a counselor with the NigerianEmbassy in Washington.   &quot;It's a matter of great concern because our image is atstake,&quot; Mr. Uku said. &quot;We are trying to promote business andprivatization right now, and that's hard to do with thingslike this going on.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
