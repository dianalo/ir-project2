Israeli officials have declined comment on persistent reportssuggesting the renewal of ties would lead to Israeli military aidto Ethiopia in exchange from allowing more Jews to leave.   The Israeli Embassy was opened Sunday under the supervision oftemporary representative Meir Yoffe, and an ambassador in AddisAbaba will soon be appointed, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said.   Yoffe said his first priority would be establishing a consularsection to deal with Jewish emigration.   Speaking on Israel Radio in a telephone interview from AddisAbaba, Yoffe indicated Foreign Minister Moshe Arens may visitEthiopia for the official opening ceremony. He did not give a datefor the ceremony.   A Foreign Ministry statement said earlier this month that Israelhoped more Jews would emigrate from Ethiopia once Israelestablished its embassy there.   Ethiopia renewed diplomatic relations with Israel on Nov. 3. Itwas one of more than 12 black African nations that severed tieswith Israel over the 1973 Middle East war. Several have renewedrelations since 1982.   ``It is a wonderful and exciting feeling,'' said Yoffe, who wasthe last Israeli diplomat to leave Ethiopia in 1973. ``We arereceived with joy and sympathy by the government and in thestreets, in all the places we go ... people remember us.''   The Sunday Times of London has said Israel agreed to supplyspare parts for Soviet weapons in Ethiopia in exchange foremigration of Jews. Israel has captured Soviet weapons from Arabcountries and Palestinian guerrillas in Lebanon.   Ethiopian immigrants in Israel say up to 18,000 Jews want toflee the East African nation, which has suffered from drought andcivil war.   There are already about 16,500 Ethiopian Jews in Israel. About8,000 of them were brought to Israel in a dramatic U.S.-assisted``Operation Moses'' airlift in November 1984-January 1985. Butreports of the airlift leaked out and embarrassed the Ethiopia'sMarxist government, which ended the operation.</TEXT></DOC>
