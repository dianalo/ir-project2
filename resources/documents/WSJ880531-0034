Marvin N. Schoenhals, Peoples Savings' president and chief executive officer, declined to state the reasons for the resignations of John L. Cherpak, former president and chief executive, and William J. Bacarella Jr., executive vice president and secretary.    On April 4, the savings bank announced that Mr. Cherpak resigned as president but remained as assistant to Mr. Schoenhals, who was hired from another financial institution. Mr. Cherpak also remained on Peoples Savings' board.    Peoples Savings officials have said the Federal Home Loan Bank Board is investigating improprieties in the savings bank's consumer-lending practices, which caused Peoples Savings to increase its loan-loss provisions last June to $6.6 million from $1.2 million. </TEXT></DOC>
