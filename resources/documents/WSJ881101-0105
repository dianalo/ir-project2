The latest quarter, which ended Oct. 15, will include nearly $2 million in charges from the settlement of litigation involving a former officer and the cancellation of a supply agreement with a former subsidiary.    In the year ago third quarter, the health products chain earned $785,000, or two cents a share. Sales in the latest quarter rose about 7% to about $79.8 million from $74.2 million in the year-ago period.    &quot;We have definitely achieved and are well into our financial turnaround,&quot; Jerry D. Horn, chairman and chief executive officer, said in an interview.    For the nine months, officials estimated profit rose 78% to $7.5 million, or 23 cents a share, from $4.3 million, or 13 cents a share. Sales in the latest nine months rose 3% to about $244 million from $236.7 million.    Full-year earnings are expected to be between $12 million and $13 million, or between 37 cents and 40 cents a share. In its fiscal 1987, GNC earned $404,000, or one cent a share. Sales will be around $355 million, compared with $350.9 million in 1987.    &quot;I believe this trend, barring unforseen external factors, should continue through 1989 and that this company is capable of earning 50 cents to 60 cents for 1989,&quot; Mr. Horn said.    Retail remains the company's strongest segment, with sales increasing about 8% in the third quarter, compared to a year ago. GNC store sales are averaging about $180 per square foot, compared with $157 per square foot in 1985.    Craig Kirsch, senior vice president and chief financial officer, said that third-quarter sales dropped in both the manufacturing and mail-order segments and that both businesses currently have losses. However, he said those areas have been restructured during the past year and predicted that &quot;all three will be profitable next year.&quot;    Mr. Horn attributed the strong earnings performance to the company's restructuring, begun in 1986. Since then, the company has closed 240 unprofitable stores, scaled back manufacturing operations by two-thirds, disposed of its foreign operations, and eliminated unprofitable products. During the past three years, the company has written off about $54 million for plant closings and the settlement of litigation. When Mr. Horn was named chairman in 1985, the company was facing several lawsuits in connection with false advertising and patent infringement.    GNC has remodeled its 1,146 stores and broadened its merchandise beyond health food and into self-care and fitness. Although GNC plans to open 25 stores a year, it's also experimenting with less traditional and less costly ways to grow. For example, the company is operating 40 GNC centers located in drugstores. It also plans to franchise stores in secondary markets, but to date has franchises only in Puerto Rico. Capital spending is also down to about $6 million to $7 million a year, compared with about $20 million three years ago.    GNC opened four prototype stores, called Gymees, which feature exercise equipment, fitness wear and sports nutrition products. Two more stores are scheduled to open in November.    Mr. Horn said store managers have greater flexibility to cater their product mix to area customers. The company has also introduced an incentive program, tying compensation and bonuses to store performance.    In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, GNC closed at $5.875, unchanged. </TEXT></DOC>
