It is accompaniedby a new sidebar, BC-Forecasters 1990s, in which prominent personalitieslook ahead to the decade's promise and challenges.    ___</BYLINE><BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE><TEXT>   Advances in science and technology promise to make the 10 yearsthat begin Jan. 1 a decade of unparalleled accomplishment. Butdamage to the atmosphere, accumulation of solid wastes, the spreadof AIDS and other threats also make the 1990s a decade of potentialperil.   ``Human beings now have the power to control their own fate to adegree that they've never had before,'' said Edward Cornish,president of the World Future Society.   Topping the World Future Society's list of challenges for the1990s: environmental damage to the Earth's climate, land, water andatmosphere.   Here, in capsules drawn from the reporting of Associated Pressspecialists, is a look at some major areas of human endeavor andconcern for the coming decade:</TEXT><NOTE>THE AIR ABOVE</NOTE><TEXT>   The intertwined issues of air pollution, the ozone layer and thegreenhouse effect will all be high on the environmental agenda inthe 1990s.   In smog-bound Los Angeles, authorities will try to change a wayof life by starting to wean commuters off gasoline-poweredautomobiles. Other cities are likely to follow suit.   Scientists, meanwhile, will train their instruments on thethinning ozone in the stratosphere, a layer that shields the Earthfrom ultraviolet rays, which can cause skin cancer. A humanpollutant _ chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs _ is destroying the ozone.Governments are trying to reduce CFC releases, but the question forthe 1990s is whether it is too little too late.   Scientists almost universally agree that carbon dioxide andother gases released into the atmosphere will produce thegreenhouse effect _ letting sunlight in, but not letting Earth'sheat out. But specialists disagree on when the warming will occurand how bad it will be. Pessimists predict the 1990s will be evenwarmer than the 1980s, one of the warmest recent decades.</TEXT><NOTE>SOLID WASTE</NOTE><TEXT>   Specialists see an upcoming crunch on the garbage front: Halfthe nation's 6,000 dumps will be filled and closed in the '90s.   Said Bruce Weddle, director of the Environmental ProtectionAgency's municipal solid waste program: ``By the end of the decade,I think recycling is going to be part of the cultural fabric ofsociety. People will be separating out all bottles, cans,newspapers, plastics, leaves and grass clippings instead ofthrowing them in one can.''   Americans now bury about 80 percent of their waste in dumps,burn 10 percent and recycle the remainder. The EPA predictsrecycling will jump to 25 percent by 1992.</TEXT><NOTE>THE AIDS EPIDEMIC</NOTE><TEXT>   The World Health Organization estimates that nine times morepeople around the world will get AIDS in the 1990s than did in the1980s. By the year 2000, there could be 6 million AIDS cases, and18 million people could be infected.   An estimated 1 million to 1.5 million Americans are now infectedwith the deadly disease. Most, perhaps all, will eventually becomeill.   Researchers cannot confidently predict a vaccine or cure in thecoming decade, but they believe AIDS could be subdued to the pointof becoming a chronic disease, one for which those infected musttake long-term medication.</TEXT><NOTE>HEART DISEASE-CANCER</NOTE><TEXT>   If current death rates continue, 13 million American lives willbe claimed in the 1990s by two big killers _ heart disease andcancer.   Medical researchers do not expect cures in the next decade.Instead, they look for new insights to help them attack thediseases from many directions.   Better understanding of cancer-causing genes and how to blockthem, for example, and of cancer-suppressing genes and how toharness them, would give medical scientists crucial new weapons towield against cancer.   New discoveries about the relationship of diet to heart diseasemight lead to innovative treatments for the nation's leading killer.</TEXT><NOTE>GENETICS</NOTE><TEXT>   Biologists who have uncovered the genetic causes of suchailments as cystic fibrosis will turn their attention to thegenetics of human behavior in the 1990s.   In human genes, scientists may find the roots of such complexdisorders as manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia.Specialists believe understanding of some behavioral disordersshould come by the year 2000.   ``I think this will be a tremendously exciting field in the next10 years,'' says David Baltimore, a Nobel laureate at theMassachusetts Institute of Technology.</TEXT><NOTE>SPACE</NOTE><TEXT>   After years of tight budgets, American scientists hope the 1990swill introduce a new ``golden age'' of space exploration.   President Bush has proposed a major commitment to completing themanned space station Freedom in the 1990s and to a permanent baseon the moon and a manned mission to Mars early in the next century.   The U.S. probe Magellan, launched from a space shuttle last May,is to orbit Venus next August. The probe Galileo, launched from ashuttle in October, is to orbit Jupiter in 1995. En route, Galileowill also study Venus and take the first closeup look at anasteroid. In 1992, the Mars Observer will be launched, to orbit thered planet for a multi-year examination.   The Soviets, meanwhile, will continue development of a spaceshuttle and exploit their own space station Mir, as they pursuetheir stated goal of dispatching cosmonauts to Mars early in the21st century.</TEXT><NOTE>MASS TRANSPORT</NOTE><TEXT>   Specialists foresee more automobiles on the road in the 1990s,on a U.S. highway system that will never keep pace.   Experts say air pollution and possible oil shortages in the '90swill spur production of cleaner, higher-mileage cars; increased useof vehicles that run on methanol, natural gas, electricity or solarpower; construction of more trolleys and other ``light rail''systems, and more vacation travel done by trains, planes and cruiseships.   Traffic management will include synchronized traffic lights,metered on-ramps, car-pool and bus lanes, reversible traffic lanes,staggered work hours, and limits on times trucks can move goods.</TEXT><NOTE>COMPUTERS</NOTE><TEXT>   The high technologists look ahead to a personal computer in the1990s that will be a blend of 3-D television and quadraphonicstereo with the hand controls of a video game machine and morespeed than car-sized mainframes of the 1980s.   ``Multimedia'' computers will rival television for attention,able to surround the user with, for example, the sights and soundsof an early morning in Paris or an erupting Hawaiian volcano.Experts say they will help educate the next generation ofvideo-hungry schoolchildren.   Other advances expected in the '90s: Machine translation oflanguage, and telerobots with human guidance that will clean upcrippled nuclear reactors and scour sclerotic arteries.</TEXT><NOTE>U.S. SOCIETY</NOTE><TEXT>   Demographics will change the face of the U.S. factory and office_ and of American society _ in the coming decade.   The private Population Reference Bureau reports that in the1970s, 24.1 million young people entered the workforce, in the1980s only 18.0 million did so, and in the 1990s the number isexpected to decline to 15.6 million.   Much of the dropoff is among non-Hispanic white males. Women andminority-group members will account for more than 80 percent of allnew entrants in the labor force in the '90s, the bureau says.   Some businesses, such as fast-food outlets, are already feelingthe shortage of new labor-market entrants and have begun seekingout retired people to fill jobs.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Dec. 31</NOTE></DOC>
