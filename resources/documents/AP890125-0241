The APA survey found that much research on the subject has beenflawed, but it also found the notion of a post-abortion syndrome isnot a ``scientifically or medically recognized'' disorder.

Bundy, who after a decade of denial told detectives from fourstates that he had murdered 23 young women since the mid-1970s, saidhe deserved his punishment. His execution in the electric chair atFlorida State Prison elicited cheers from more than 100 people whostood in a field across from the penitentiary.</TEXT><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The election of the first woman bishop of theEpiscopal Church has been approved over some adamant objections, butchurch officials say they don't expect the misgivings to developinto a schism.
