JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A panel of the National Academy of Scienceshas concluded there is insufficent scientific evidence to assurethat oil can be produced off the California and Florida coastswithout harming the environment, informed sources said Thursday.   The report by a panel of the Academy's National Research Councilis to be presented Friday to a presidential task force reviewingoil leasing in federal waters off the coasts of the two states.   President Bush, who in his oil business days helped pioneeroffshore exploration, has held up a decison on whether to go aheadwith leasing pending a review of their potential environmentalimpact.   According to sources familiar with the panel's findings, thepanel has concluded that the existing data on the impact of oilexploration in the three areas it studied _ northern California,southern California and the souther Gulf Coast area of Florida _are inadequate and not reliable enough to warrant a decision beingmade on whether to award leases.   The panel did not specifically recommend against oil or gasexploration in the three areas, but said more scientific andtechnical data should be gathered before a decision is made one wayor the other, said the sources, who spoke on condition that theynot be identified by name or affiliation.   Environmentalists have long opposed oil driling in the threeareas _ 1.1 million acres of ocean off Southern California, another6.7 million acres off Northern California, and 14 million acres inthe Gulf of Mexico near the Florida Everglades. Southern Californiawaters already are an important production area but oil has notbeen found in the other two areas.   According to the sources, who spoke on the condition that theynot be identified by name, the Academy's panel of scientificexperts examined available data on what impact exploration in thethree areas would have on the environment, marine geography andnearby mainland economy.   The findings are expected to be a major victory forenvironmentalists and others who have opposed offshore oilexploration in the three areas.   ``If they're saying this it's a major swipe at those who are fordrilling,'' said Lisa Speer, a staff lawyer for the NaturalResources Defense Council who has opposed offshore drilling.   When Bush announced his drillijng delay in February, he alsoasked the academy to examine available information on environmentimpacts of drilling as well as data on the potential for a majorpetroleum discovery.   The task force, headed by Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan, is tomake a recommendation to the president by the end of the year.</TEXT></DOC>
