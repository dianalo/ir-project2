It is pureJapanese bull semen.   Mr. Lively's store of the stuff is worth $2 million. Nobull.</LP><TEXT>   Semen is all that remains of four bulls spirited out ofJapan 14 years ago. Their names were Judo, Mazda, Fuji andRyusho, and they are believed to have been the only cattle ofthe Wagyu breed ever to leave Japan.   The bulls died natural deaths after 12 years in the U.S.,but in the meantime they left behind enough semen forthousands of progeny.   American cattlemen used to consider the Wagyu breed punyand pitifully ugly. Then, in 1988, Japan agreed to end quotasby 1991 that have stifled imports of beef from America.   Suddenly, Wagyus looked a lot prettier to U.S. ranchers,who saw a way to horn in on a market.   The Japanese have a special love for Wagyu meat, oftencalled Kobe Beef in the U.S. They say the way fat is marbledinto the meat produces a divine taste, buttery texture andperfect appearance. They pay up to $180 a pound for it, andthe idea of capturing even a small slice of this has kindledacute interest in American Wagyu.   Mr. Lively's liquid assets have become immensely valuable.Ranchers from Idaho to Australia looking for a stake in themarket have begun draining his semen stockpile, paying $250 avial -- enough to impregnate one cow. Even though that'sabout 10 times the cost of normal high-grade semen, Mr.Lively has sold $1 million worth already.   Not only that, but some also pay up to $25,000 each forMr. Lively's nearly full-blooded Wagyu bulls, which hecreated by inbreeding generations of cattle with Japanesesemen.   Under normal circumstances, ranchers simply would importWagyus from Japan to populate their feed lots. Butcircumstances aren't normal with Japan. While Japanesefarmers freely import cattle, they won't let Wagyus out.   Japanese cattlemen say Wagyus and their seed are nationaltreasures. Exporting them, they say, would be like smugglingout defense secrets. The informal export ban is enforced bypressure from powerful farm cooperatives.   Japanese cattlemen &quot;think that if they export Wagyu sementhey may be immediately menaced by wide-scale reproduction inthe U.S.,&quot; says livestock professor Shozo Watanabe ofKagoshima University.   They may have a point. Today, the four exported bulls'genetic pool -- semen and hundreds of mixed-blood Wagyucattle -- gives U.S. ranchers a rare opportunity to take alesson from Japan's industrial success: reverse engineering.   U.S. breeders have raised cattle that are as much as63/64ths Wagyu (more than the 15/16ths is consideredpurebred). Because of a shortage of Wagyu cows, Texas Aandamp;MUniversity is even cloning them, implanting identical embryosin non-Wagyu cows.   &quot;We can reverse-engineer this and end up better thanthem,&quot; says Robert Rebholtz, president of Agri Beef Co. ofBoise, Idaho, who is crossing Wagyus with black Angus cattle.   Agri Beef, like most U.S. producers, plans to make thebeef both for export to Japan and for the U.S. Producers sayit not only tastes better, but is lower in the kind of fatsthat raise cholesterol levels. (It will also be moreexpensive. One reason: Wagyu beef are fed less each day for amuch longer period than U.S. cattle, which are fed hugeamounts quickly so they can be fattened up and processed in ahurry.)   The circumstances of the bulls' exodus from Japan arestill a dark mystery and discussion of their departure isstill like waving a red flag to the Japanese. The bulls&quot;shouldn't have been let out,&quot; says Umeo Oikawa, a Wagyuraiser in northern Japan. &quot;Those cattle weren't any oneperson's property. They were raised through the efforts ofJapanese farmers over thousands of years.&quot;   And indeed, for a long time the bulls seemed to carry aTut-like curse.   In 1975, Texas cattleman Morris Whitney heard of Wagyumeat from friends in the military and decided that Americanswere ready for Kobe Beef. He linked up with a mysteriousJapanese businessman who somehow got the bulls onto a planeto New Jersey faster than the Japanese could say, &quot;Where'sthe beef?&quot;   Then partnerships collapsed, deals soured, the Japanesebusinessman disappeared and Mr. Whitney ended up with fourbulls on his farm, some set loose among the cacti on the openrange.   While his bulls dined on prickly pear, Mr. Whitney courtedstores such as Neiman Marcus, which he hoped would sell hisWagyu beef in high-priced gift boxes much as Japanese storesdo.   But there weren't any bites from stores or other ranchers,who didn't care to raise the homely beast. A Wagyu iseverything an American rancher disdains, what with its daintybones, thin-skinned torso and narrow, pointed rump that makesit look swaybacked.   Ranchers, who are fond of macho cattle, complain thatWagyus are nervous, hyperactive animals that irritatinglywalk with tiny little mincing steps.   The bulls survived the open range, but for Mr. Whitney,the years were lean. After sinking $300,000 into breeding thecattle, he sold out to a partner for $6,500 and went into thereal estate business. &quot;I was ahead of my time,&quot; he sighs.   The buyer, a veterinarian named Dennis Wendt, apparentlyhad big dreams of becoming king of the Wagyu business.Drawing in friends and relatives as investors with what couldbe called a tender offer, he mimicked the legendary nurturingof the Japanese, who have sometimes attributed their beef'smarbling to beer feedings and individual massage sessions,although those methods are not actually practiced widely inJapan.   Mr. Wendt rubbed down his cattle and trucked in 6,000cases of beer, popping open cans into troughs.   The main effect? &quot;Just what you'd expect,&quot; says Mr. Wendt,&quot;Drunk, lazy cattle.&quot;   The bovine bacchanalia didn't create any better meat, andthe venture folded in bitterness in 1983. The assets werecarved up among partners. Some got cattle. Others got nearlyworthless semen.   That any survived may be a minor miracle. Last year, Mr.Lively says, a large-scale rancher visiting his LoDo Ranchconfessed that he unknowingly dumped out 6,000 units of Wagyusemen, worth about $1.5 million at Mr. Lively's prices.   Mr. Lively ended up with the four bulls on LoDo Ranchafter his partner sued Mr. Wendt's venture. For years, hisrancher friends ribbed him for raising his &quot;uglies.&quot; Mr.Lively, a 62-year-old retired stone carver, had little to dobut quietly breed his herd. &quot;They all thought I was crazy,&quot;he says. &quot;All I had was these stinking cows. And they weren'teven pretty.&quot;   He is clearly getting the last laugh now because anyonewho wants the prime semen has no other choice. The stuff isexpensive, says Jerry Reeves, a Washington State Universityprofessor who buys it for the Wagyu cattle the school breeds,&quot;but he's the only choice we've got.&quot;   Moreover, Japanese companies are aggressively buying U.S.ranches and are eager to stock them with Wagyus. Mr. Lively,who keeps a Japanese flag on a crooked flagpole near hisbarn, has sold animals to a U.S. unit of Japan's big ItohamFoods Inc.   Executives of Toyota's trading subsidiary visited LoDoRanch this year with a mind to buying most of the operation.The deal collapsed after Toyota balked at the price -- whichMr. Lively won't reveal -- but Mr. Lively says they'll beback after they chew it over.   Japan's ranchers contend that U.S. Wagyu meat isn't thereal thing, but the big test will come next January: That'swhen Texas Aandamp;M plans to ship beef from 10 of its Wagyus toJapan for blind taste tests. Aandamp;M officials aren't predictingthe outcome of the head-to-head competition, but they're surethey won't be slaughtered.</TEXT></DOC>
