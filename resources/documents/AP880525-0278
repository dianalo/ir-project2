(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A record company executive, a reputed mobfigure and a third man were convicted Wednesday on federalconspiracy charges in a case authorities called an example oforganized crime influence in the recording industry.   Morris Levy, president of Roulette Records, and two associates _Howard Fisher and Dominick Canterino _ were convicted of two countseach of conspiring to commit extortion.   They were charged with an attempted shakedown of John LaMonte ofDarby, Pa., who ran a record wholesale company, in a 1985 disputeover $1.25 million in records and tapes from MCA Records Inc. ofLos Angeles. MCA has not been charged in the case.   After a three-week trial, the jury deliberated about 4{ hoursover two days before convicting Levy, 60, of New York City; Fisher,60, the comptroller of Roulette Records; and Canterino, 57, whomlaw enforcement officials described as a member of the Genoveseorganized crime family.   Attorneys for the defendants said they would appeal the verdicts.   Federal Judge Stanley S. Brotman, whose district includes Darby,scheduled sentencing for July 8. Each defendant faces a maximumsentence of 40 years in prison.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Bruce Repetto said the government wonits case on the merits of hours of taped conversations obtained bygovernment wiretaps at Levy's office and other locations.   ``We didn't offer a whole lot beyond the tapes,'' Repetto said.   After opening statements in the case, Repetto told Brotman thegovernment would prove that the case involved reputed mob ties.   ``The organized crime element is there,'' Repetto said.   FBI documents filed in the case said government agenciesbelieved Levy, a self-made millionaire, has been involved withorganized crime for 20 years.   But Brotman ordered prosecutors not to discuss organized crimeconnections during the course of the trial.   Repetto, in a meeting with reporters following the verdict,declined to comment on whether the jury drew conclusions thatorganized crime played a role in the case.   ``Mr. Canterino did not drop in from Mars,'' said Repetto, whoasked the judge to raise bail on Canterino and Levy from $500,000to $5 million cash.   ``It's been reported that Mr. Levy wishes to go to Australia,''Repetto told the judge while describing Canterino as a high-rankingmember of the conspiracy.   The judge ordered bail for Canterino and Levy to be raised to $1million that will be secured by a $15 million farm belonging toLevy.   Defense attorneys assured the judge the men would turn in theirpassports to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Newark and would notapply for new passports.   ``He isn't going anywhere,'' Levy's attorney, Martin London,told the judge.   During the trial, the defense attacked record wholesalerLaMonte's credibility, calling the man an ex-con with a history ofcriminal activity.   LaMonte, who served 18 months in prison for a 1977 convictionfor bootlegging records, agreed to wear a wiretap while meetingwith the three men over an 18-month period. He did not testify inthis case, however.   ``LaMonte and his business were the victims of this extortion,''Repetto said.   Defense attorneys also alleged through the trial that one ofLaMonte's three partners in record wholesale firm was GaetanoVastola, a reputed member of a New Jersey organized crime family.   Vastola and three co-defendants go on trial this fall beforeBrotman on federal rackeetering charges related to the Levy case,Repetto said.</TEXT></DOC>
