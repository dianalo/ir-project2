(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Tyson Foods Inc. began a sweetened andhostile $941.2 million tender offer Friday for Holly Farms Corp.,its biggest competitor in the poultry processing business.   Holly Farms, which earlier this week rejected a $900 million bidfrom Tyson, said it would study the $52-a-share offer. Securitiesanalysts said they expected Holly Farms to fight a takeover attempt.   Investors apparently expected bidding for Holly Farms tocontinue, although Tyson said it would not raise its offer anyfurther. Holly Farms stock rose $2.75 to $53.62{ a share in NewYork Stock Exchange composite trading Friday.   Analysts said Tyson, the nation's biggest poultry producer,would increase its market share from 18 percent to 28 percent if itwere successful in taking over second-ranked Holly Farms.   ``I think that if (Holly Farms) weren't already out looking fora white knight, that they will be now,'' said Napoleon Overton, asecurities analyst with Morgan Keegan at Memphis, Tenn., whereHolly Farms is headquartered. ``It's obvious that Tyson Foods isdead serious about acquiring Holly Farms.''   A white knight is a friendly suitor that rescues a targetcompany from a hostile takeover attempt.   Overton called Holly Farms vulnerable.   ``If you're a Holly Farms stockholder, you've got to think ...just prior to the (first) offer, (the stock) was in the $40 area;relatively speaking, $52 looks pretty good,'' he said.   ``In today's environment of takeovers and acquisitions, if athird party is willing to pay you more than the stock market or thecompany, you've got to consider it,'' he said.   Tyson's offer was scheduled to expire Nov. 18.   The company's previous bid was for $45 a share plus a quartershare of Tyson Class A common stock for each of Holly Farms' 18.1million outstanding shares.   The Memphis-based Holly Farms has 10 business days to respond toTyson's offer. Tyson attorney Jim Blair said he did not expect tohear from Holly Farms until the end of that time.   Overton expected Holly Farms to fight the Tyson bid.   Albert Klein, director of research for Robyns Capital at NewYork, said he did not know what defenses Holly Farms might be ableto mount, other than finding a white knight.   After the first bid, Holly Farms activated a shareholder rightsplan, known as a ``poison pill'' takeover defense, aimed at makinga hostile takeover attempt prohibitively expensive.   Blair said Tyson believed it could defeat that move in court.   ``If enough shareholders tender their stock, then we think thecourt will knock that poison pill out,'' Blair said. ``It willdepend on how many tender their stock.''   The offer was advertised Friday in the Wall Street Journal andthe New York Times.   Don Tyson, chairman and chief executive officer of Tyson, wasout of his office and unavailable for comment Friday, a spokesmansaid.   R. Lee Taylor, president and chief executive officer of HollyFarms, said in a statement after the first offer, ``The board ofdirectors of Holly Farms believes the best long-term interests ofthe company and its shareholders will be served by the companycontinuing to operate as an independent entity.''   Tyson's operations include hatcheries, feed mills, processingplants and a sophisticated marketing arm. Tyson produces 14 millionpounds of chicken meat each week and sells chickens tosupermarkets, fast food chains and institutional customers.   Last year, Tyson reported net income of $67 million on sales ofabout $1.8 billion.   About half of Holly Farms' sales are in chicken. The companyreported 1987 earnings of $36.2 million on sales of $1.6 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
