Orsini of the Bureau ofAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms told the House Foreign AffairsCommittee's Task Force on International Narcotics Control.   ``What we cannot determine is what percentage of the firearmsused by the cartels are from a U.S. source,'' said Orsini, whoheads the ATF's Firearms Enforcement Branch.   Information from traces of guns seized in Colombia indicate thatdrug traffickers have attempted to buy large numbers of guns fromundercover agents, but ``far more are trickling out a few at atime,'' he said.   Noting that there are 270,000 licensed gun dealers in the UnitedStates, Orsini said the dealers ``inadvertently'' contributegreatly to the drug traffickers' armaments, primarily throughsmall, legal sales to individuals who then smuggle the weapons toColombia.   Asked by panel chairman Lawrence J. Smith, D-Fla., whether U.S.gun dealers are involved in conspiracies to provide arms to thedrug traffickers, Orsini said, ``It would be naive to think it'snot going on to a certain extent.'' However, he said, ``We have notseen any indication of widespread collusion.''   Orsini refused to criticize the legality of individual gun salesin the United States, prompting gun-control advocate Rep. HarryJohnston, D-Fla., to say, ``I'm embarrassed for your organizationthat you gave that answer.''   In September, Colombian President Virgilio Barco and JusticeMinister Monica de Greiff asked the United States to curb gunshipments to drug traffickers who declared ``total war'' on thegovernment after the crackdown began Aug. 18.   In the past 10 weeks, drug traffickers have been blamed for manyshootings as well as 237 bombings that killed 33 people and injured222.   William P. Rosenblatt, assistant Customs commissioner forenforcement, told the House panel of several seizures of weaponsheading for Colombia:   _An investigation in March 1988 in West Palm Beach, Fla., led tothe arrest of David Candiotti and Carlos Enrique Gil, who allegedlywere negotiating with undercover Customs and ATF operatives to buyfor export to Colombia 100 pounds of C-4 explosives, 25 Mac-11machine guns, 20 Colt AR-15 rifles, and five fully automatic M-60machine guns.   During the investigation, agents identified two previousshipments of munitions, including 25 pounds of plastic explosives,30 AR-15 rifles, five .50-caliber rifles, 25 silencers for Mac-11machine pistols, two sniper rifles and night vision equipment,Rosenblatt said. These items were exported via private aircraft``and delivered to an individual alleged to be associated with theCali (Colombia) cartel,'' a rival to the Medellin cocaine cartel,he said.   _Customs inspectors at the Los Angeles International Airport onApril 29, 1988 discovered 16 hand grenades, four AR-15 rifles thathad been converted to fully automatic operation, six bullet-proofvests and a pair of night vision goggles concealed in a largeair-conditioning unit destined for Cali aboard Avianca Airlines.   ATF spokesman Jack Killorin said Monday that Customs officialsduring the summer ``grabbed 37 rifles on an airplane going down toBarranquilla, Colombia. We were able to run down those guns, lockup some of the purchasers.''   The ATF has been helping to trace guns seized in Colombia, andwants to send agents to that country permanently to enhance theeffort. In an interview Monday, ATF Director Stephen E. Higginssaid, ``My understanding is the Colombia officials think that is agood way to proceed.''   Of the weapons traced, the gun of choice among Colombia's drugtraffickers appears to be the Colt AR-15 semiautomaticassault-style rifle, but many other weapons also have turned up,according to Killorin.   The AR-15 was the most popular U.S.-made weapon similar to theimported AK-47 and Uzi carbines that were banned from the UnitedStates in the spring.   Colt Industries Inc suspended retail sales of the AR-15 afterthe Bush Administration imposed a temporary import suspension onthe foreign-made semiautomatic assault-style weapons in March.Company spokesman Mike Dunn said that sales to U.S. governmentagencies and law enforcement continue.</TEXT></DOC>
