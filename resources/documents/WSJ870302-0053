Those familiar with the Merc's action said other Merc traders also will be charged in connection with the alleged violations of trading rules.    The penalties by an exchange committee, covering trades made from 1984 through last summer, are among the harshest levied against stock-index futures traders, industry officials said.    The severe actions, they said, reflect the Merc's tougher enforcement stance in the past several months as it faces rising criticism from Wall Street customers and others of certain trading practices, including allowing brokers to trade for both their own accounts and customers.    The penalties were handed down by a five-member special hearing committee of the board of governors.    Merc officials wouldn't comment on the action beyond the briefly worded announcements of the penalties.    Merc officials, though, said they have been reviewing trading conditions in the crowded Sandamp;P 500 pit for several months and expect in a few weeks to propose eliminating or sharply restricting dual trading by Sandamp;P 500 brokers. Sandamp;P 500 futures trading accounts for 75% of all stock-index trading in the country.    The exchange committee fined Jeffrey G. Donnelly $100,000, alleging that he circumvented &quot;restrictions placed on his personal trading&quot; by his employer from 1984 through 1986.    The committee fined John D. Riss, an independent Merc trader, $50,000, alleging that he aided another broker in side-stepping personal-trading restrictions. The exchange didn't identify the other broker or specify how the assistance occurred.    The penalties are effective March 13, the exchange said.    Neither finding named the brokers together, but exchange sources said the two had assisted each other.    The committee also alleged that Mr. Donnelly made non-competitive trades, holding customer orders without allowing other pit traders to bid on them.    He was directed by the exchange to pay back profits gained through the trading to his employer, which wasn't named in the disciplinary action.    William Phelan, Mr. Donnelly's attorney, said, &quot;I don't believe the evidence presented by the exchange staff supports these findings.&quot; He said Mr. Donnelly and he were studying whether to appeal the decision to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.    Mr. Riss couldn't be reached.    Mr. Donnelly was employed by a unit of Chicago Research andamp; Trading Group, a closely held futures and options trading firm, in the period covered by the exchange's finding, the firm said. But Chicago Research andamp; Trading officials declined to comment on the penalties.    Mr. Donnelly's profits from the improper trading cited by the exchange totaled &quot;in the mid-six figures,&quot; an industry official said.    Those familiar with the Merc's action said a member alerted the exchange's compliance department to the violations late last summer. </TEXT></DOC>
