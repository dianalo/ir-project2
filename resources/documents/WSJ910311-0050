The move is part of a package recommended by theInternational Monetary Fund, which has agreed to provideRomania with about $1 billion in aid, if it acts swiftly toput a free market in place.   Beginning in April, noncommercial organizations andprivate individuals, both Romanian and foreign, may tradeforeign exchange through authorized banks. The National Bankbegan limited, experimental hard-currency trading in Februarywith import-export companies. The rate of the Romanian leu onthis market has fluctuated between 170 and 225 to the dollar,about equal to the black market rate, which in effect wouldnow be institutionalized.   Importers must sell half their hard-currency earnings tothe state at the official rate of 35 leu to the dollar beforethey can use the open market. &quot;This will be used to build upthe foreign reserves and finance vital imports such asenergy,&quot; a Romanian official said.                                                                                                          JAPAN TO AID SOUTH AFRICA                                                                                                          Japan, in its first official aid to South Africa, willprovide scientific equipment for 1,400 children in 13 blackschools in the Transvaal. The $41,400 grant is to helpdisadvantaged students reach a higher technical level.Visiting Tokyo last year, Nelson Mandela appealed for aid forSouth African blacks. Japan imposes limited economicsanctions against Pretoria's white government.                                                                                                          `YOUNG MARSHAL' LEAVES TAIWAN                                                                                                          The army officer who kidnapped Chiang Kai-shek in 1936 wasallowed to leave Taiwan Sunday, after decades of housearrest. The departure of 89-year-old Chang Hsuehliang, whowill visit his children in San Francisco for a month,indicates the island's Nationalist government had finallyforgiven the &quot;Young Marshal,&quot; a hero to the mainlandCommunists. Mr. Chang kidnapped the Nationalist leader incentral China to force him into an alliance with theCommunists against the invading Japanese. Chiang agreed to analliance after his release, but Mr. Chang was brought toTaiwan as a prisoner in the 1940s. The civil war resumed inChina after the Japanese were defeated, and the Nationalistsfled to Taiwan in 1949.                                                                                                          AUSTRALIANS PUT ON THE POUNDS                                                                                                          In Australia, 60% of men and 50% of women over age 35 and25% of children under 16 are overweight or obese, theNational Heart Foundation said. Australians have been puttingon five or six extra pounds since the 1960s. Men's averagewaist has increased to 36 inches from 34, and fashion houses,which once stopped women's clothes at size 12, now make sizes14 and 16.                                                                                                          MEXICO CITY POLLUTION EMERGENCY                                                                                                          Mexico City extended an air pollution emergency throughthe weekend, forcing its dirtiest industries to cut theiractivity 50%. More than 70 plants in the area were affectedby the slowdown. A dense layer of smog hovered above the cityof about 18 million people last week, and the air had morethan three times the maximum acceptable ozone level.                                                                                                          MORE NUCLEAR WOES IN JAPAN                                                                                                          High pressure readings forced a nuclear fuel reprocessingcenter in Tokaimura, 71 miles northwest of Tokyo, toautomatically shut down. The incident Friday was at least thethird since Japan's worst nuclear mishap, Feb. 9, when a pipeburst at the Mihama Nuclear Power plant in southern Japan.Officials say none of the events has posed any public danger.Still, the problems have heightened concern over the safetyof Japan's growing nuclear program.

Three-fourths of those who contracted the infectionbefore last year will have died by 1995, said the agency,which is the World Health Organization's Americas regionaloffice.   Almost two million people in the Western Hemisphere havealready been infected with HIV. Of those, more than onemillion infections are in the U.S. and Canada, and the restin Latin America and the Caribbean. As of this year, anestimated 500,000 AIDS cases occurred in the hemisphere.   In some Caribbean countries and North American cities,AIDS is the leading cause of death of men aged 25 to 34.Latin America is experiencing a rapid increase in theepidemic. Cases are underrecognized and underreported.   Recent analyses show that in the Western Hemisphere, morethan 90% of HIV transmission is by sexual intercourse, withan increasing proportion of that heterosexual; less than 10%is by blood transfusion or needles.
