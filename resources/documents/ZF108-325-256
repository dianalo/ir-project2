Langley Research Center.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Fiber Cabling Foresight Paid Off at Langley CenterandM;NASA's foresight in installing fiber cabling years ago is helping one of itsolder research centers move to state-of-the-art networking technology today.andM;Edwin Riddle, head of the Communications and Network Systems Branch at theNASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, Va., said the sprawling facilitytook its first step in using Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) productsabout four months ago to link two of its Ethernet local area networkstogether.andM;&quot;We looked at several vendors' FDDI equipment before we decided on theFibronics FDDI bridges,&quot; Riddle said, referring to the four FX 8210Ethernet-to-FDDI bridges that NASA purchased from Fibronics InternationalInc. in Hyannis, Mass.andM;Two of the four units are undergoing testing at the facility's laboratory,although Riddle hopes soon to use one of those two bridges to give yetanother Ethernet LAN a 100-megabit/sec backbone connection.andM;&quot;When we looked at the problem of computer networking back in 1983, we sawthat we had a large distributed computing environment in addition to ourcentral computing resources,&quot; Riddle said.andM;The facility's central scientific computer complex includes a Cray ResearchInc. Cray-2 supercomputer, Control Data Corp. Cyber mainframes, andsuper-minicomputers from Convex Computer Corp.andM;Spread throughout 100 other buildings at Langley Research Center are personalcomputers, Macintoshes, Sun workstations and MicroVAXes.andM;Within each of the buildings, the computers connect over a thick Ethernetnetwork and, except in rare instances, there is one Ethernet network perbuilding.andP;  Almost all the high-level protocols are TCP/IP.andP;  The Ethernets inturn connect to a 10-megabit/sec token-ring network from Proteon Inc. ofWestborough, Mass.andP;  The medium for this backbone network is 62.5/125-micronmultimode fiber that was installed several years ago.andM;&quot;There is no bandwidth problem within the buildings, but the fiber backboneis definitely getting to the point where we see the need for increasedbandwidth,&quot; Riddle said.andM;The problem was alleviated a little over a year ago when NASA upgraded asection of the fiber backbone to an 80-megabit/sec network with Proteon'sProNet 80 bridges.andM;Although there is no firm decision yet on making the transition to FDDItechnology, Riddle said the attraction of FDDI -- aside from its faster datatransfer rate -- is that it is a standard for fiber networks and its dualcounter rotating rings provide redundancy.andM;&quot;Our intent is to complete an evaluation in fiscal year 1990 before decidingon FDDI.andP;  At the time we started getting involved with ProNet 80, we stillweren't sure whether FDDI would take hold,&quot; Riddle said.andM;The official said he is satisfied for the most part with the Fibronicsbridges, which are protocol transparent and each of which can be configuredto support Ethernet LANs even though the NASA site uses a single LANconnection.andM;Riddle added, however, that network management is &quot;one area where we'reworking with Fibronics to upgrade their software.&quot;andM;The bridges should have a protocol filtering capability to restrict certainprotocols from passing through the unit on to the network, and they alsoshould have a better method for gathering traffic, he said.andM;&quot;This is key for us proceeding to FDDI,&quot; he said.andM;Hal Spurney, Fibronics' marketing director, said the company soon willrelease software that will allow custom filtering, and it also plans toannounce an improved accounting package that can spool the information to adatabase or printer.andM;Riddle said FDDI product vendors have not yet addressed one problem: Althoughcompanies offer products to channel-attach IBM-compatible mainframes to anFDDI ring, no similar hardware exists to connect supercomputers.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
