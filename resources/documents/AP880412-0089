(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gov. Rose Mofford has joined those whowant the May 17 recall election canceled on grounds she shouldn'thave to risk removal when the recall was aimed at her predecessor,the ousted Evan Mecham.   The Arizona Supreme Court was scheduled to hear arguments todayon a taxpayers' lawsuit that seeks cancellation of the special vote.   Holding the election would ``provide that Governor Mofford couldbe removed from office by virtue of recall petitions aimed againstGovernor Mecham,'' according to a legal brief filed Monday by Mrs.Mofford's attorney, David Campbell.   ``The Constitution does not provide for removal of the governorby a recall aimed at her predecessor,'' Mrs. Mofford's brief said.Mecham was removed from office April 4 after an impeachmentconviction by the Senate, and Mrs. Mofford was sworn in the nextday.   Attorney General Bob Corbin, defending acting Secretary of StateKaren Osborne in the suit, contended last week that nothing in theConstitution permits the cancellation of a recall election once ithas been scheduled.   Democrat Carolyn Warner's lawyer also filed a brief Mondayurging that the election be called off. Mrs. Warner, who had beencampaigning for the job, has said she will ask that her name beremoved from the ballot if Mrs. Mofford is allowed to run.   But Republican candidates John Rhodes and Jack Londen andindependent John Oertle Sr. filed papers saying the recall shouldbe held because the people who signed petitions indicated they wantto choose their next governor.   Mecham's spokesman, Norman Martin, said the former governor wasnot filing papers in the case. However, he said that if the courtrules the recall must be held, Mecham expects to file suit in aneffort to get his name reinstated on the ballot. Ms. Osborne lastweek removed Mecham's name after Corbin said he is not entitled torun because he is no longer governor.   Mrs. Mofford's brief contended she should not have to faceremoval from office so soon after taking over the governorship.   ``Governor Mofford has not been impeached,'' Campbell's briefsaid. ``Neither has anyone circulated petitions demanding herrecall. Indeed, no such petitions could be circulated because shehas held office for only one wweek.''   The constitution requires a public official to be in office forat least six months before a recall petition campaign can bestarted.   Mrs. Mofford's name was put on the ballot following a draftcampaign, and she has thus far avoided declaring her own candidacyfor fear of running afoul of Arizona's ``resign to run'' law.   Mrs. Warner's petition said the recall should be canceledbecause ``those individuals who signed recall petitions werespecifically petitioning to recall the then-Gov. Evan Mecham fromoffice.'' She also noted that if the recall were held and Mrs.Mofford were beaten by another candidate, she would not be entitledto return to her former position as secretary of state.   A petition filed by Rhodes' attorney said it would be ``an abuseof discretion'' for Ms. Osborne to cancel the recall election.   Londen's brief said he already had spent more than $200,000 forhis candidacy on billboards, television ads, literature and staff.   Oertle's brief said that canceling the vote would violate hisconstitutional right to hold office.</TEXT></DOC>
