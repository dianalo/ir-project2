It takes two rings of the doorbell and a series of knocks tosummon the head of Home Box Office to the entrance of bungalow 11at the posh, pink Beverly Hills Hotel.   Fuchs' delay in answering the door is indicative of the way hepresents himself and his behemoth company during the next 45minutes.   Alternately tugging at his shorts and sprawling across a sofa,Fuchs smacks loudly on a piece of fruit. To specific questions, hegives vague answers or aggressively counters with queries of hisown.   Talking to Michael Fuchs is not easy. But then, the leader ofHBO has never prided himself on congeniality.   He likes to conduct business with an in-your-face attitude. Thisdoes not make him one of the most well-liked men in theever-competitive world of cable.   Fuchs knows this. He thrives on it.   ``Screw 'em,'' he said when Paramount unsuccessfully threatenedHBO's parent company, Time Inc., with a hostile takeover last year.   But the vista from which an arrogant Fuchs once surveyed hiscompetitors is now eroding.   With 17.3 million subscribers, HBO's growth is stagnant.   About 22 percent of cable-equipped homes take HBO, the samenumber as in 1983. The Comedy Channel, HBO's latest foray into theovercrowded market of basic cable stations, has been far from asuccess.   Not to mention that arch-rival Viacom International Inc., ownersof basic cable standards such as MTV, Nickolodeon and pay channelShowtime, started HA!, its own 24-hour comedy station, five monthsafter HBO.   Neither has captured the attention of more than 8 millionviewers each in a market where more than half of America's 93.1million TV households subscribe to cable.   When Fuchs launched The Comedy Channel a year ago, he called itHBO's ``manifest destiny.''   Now, he has changed his tune.   ``Going out with a basic cable channel right now is like goingthrough an Indian gantlet,'' Fuchs says of an industry where cablesubscribers already can chose from an average of 30 stations at noextra cost to their monthly bill. ``We're not masochists.''   All talks of merging HA! and The Comedy Channel are off, hesays.   ``I don't want to put any more marbles in the cable business,''he says. ``We're a plenty big player.''   Indeed, HBO is. Besides being the No. 1 pay cable channel, thenetwork also owns Cinemax, 40 percent of the E! entertainmentnetwork, and a newly formed production company that plansprogramming for the Big Three networks and other cable services. Italso has a highly lucrative foreign and domestic video distributionarm.   The merger of parent company Time Inc. with WarnerCommunications now makes HBO part of the world's largest mediaconglomerate.   Still, pay television has lost its momentum. VCRs and a vastarray of basic cable stations such as Turner Network Television andthe USA Network are responsible for helping to stunt pay TV'sgrowth.   If venturing into basic cable channels no longer is the futurefor HBO, where does it go in an ever-changing cable world?   And what will HBO offer subscribers who must pay, on theaverage, an additional $12 to receive its programming when basiccable costs already provide made-for-cable movies, classic films,specials and sports events?   Fuchs calls such questions ``naive.''   Look, he says, taking another bite of plum, ``you bring 'em asgood a television program as you can. What does any other network... what is NBC going to bring their customers?   ``I still think we do the best movies in cable,'' he says, hismouth full of fruit. ``We think we're in a very crowded televisionworld. It's a hell of a lot more crowded now that it's ever been.   ``Customers who have lived with HBO see it as a little moreexperimental, a little more provocative, a little more honest. Adocumentary on HBO has more credibility than anywhere else.''   Last year's ``Murderers Among Us,'' the story of Nazi hunterSimon Wiesenthal, won HBO an Emmy for writing in a televisionmovie.   This month, the network received a leading 100 Award for CableExcellence nominations. Among those noted were the series ``DreamOn,'' ``Not Necessarily the News'' and ``Tales From the Crypt'' andcable movies ``The Image'' and ``Age-Old Friends.''   Fuchs sees such accolades as a key part of HBO's survival.   ACE nominations aside, HBO still has not significantly increasedits subscriber base. Asked again how the pay channel plans to keepup with a market that has slowed its growth, Fuchs replies:   ``It gets a hundred and thirty ACE nominations when the next guygets 30. It gives the best programming on cable, how's that?   ``But you know that already, don't ya?''   Actually, as mentioned earlier, it was 100 nominations. And thenext closest competitors were TNT and Showtime, with 31 nominationseach.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Tues PMs, Nov. 13</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
