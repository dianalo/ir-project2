At least two students were reported seriously injured whenpolice broke into the office to stop the two-hour protest.   Police said 23 students from eight universities in Seouloverpowered security guards and charged into Parliamentary Hall, alegislative office building near the National Assembly building.All were arrested.   The students demanded immediate punishment of former PresidentChun Doo-hwan, who has been under investigation for allegedcorruption and brutality.   The students broke windows and unfolded a giant placard thatread ``Drive out Yankees'' and ``Arrest Chun Doo-hwan and hiswife.''   The radicals locked themselves inside the fourth-floor office ofChung Ho-yong, a senior member of the governing Democratic JusticeParty, and tossed out papers, chairs and a portrait of PresidentRoh Tae-woo. Chung was not in the office.   Dissidents charge that Chung, a former army general, played arole in supressing a 1980 uprising in the southern city of Kwangjuin which nearly 200 people were killed.   Hundreds of riot police backed by firetrucks surrounded thebuilding and spread mattresses on the ground to prevent suicideattempts by students who threatened to burn the office or jump fromwindows if police intervened.   One student cut his stomach with a razor when about 100 policeofficers broke through the office door to end the seizure,according to witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   Another protester jumped from the window and was taken to thehospital, where he was reported in stable condition. One of Chung'saides and several policemen were also hurt, the South Korean newsagency Yonhap said.   Leaflets scattered by the students criticized the United States,which the dissidents say supports the division of the KoreanPeninsula. The students are demanding the withdrawal of about42,000 American troops stationed in South Korea under a mutualdefense pact.   Also Thursday, about 500 students at Seoul's Dongkuk Universitybattled riot police with firebombs and rocks after ananti-government rally.</TEXT></DOC>
