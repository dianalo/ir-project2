Stephen Clark doesn't.   &quot;Nobody knows what the rules are,&quot; says Mr. Gorges,director of South China Brokerage Co., a Hong Kong brokeragefirm. &quot;{But} we're trying to get on the short list of brokersthat can act there.&quot; He missed out on the private placementof China's first share issue to foreign investors since 1949,but says he's eager to get a piece of other issues beingplaced with institutional investors this month.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Clark, on the other hand, is highly suspicious ofChina's new equity market. &quot;As investors, we're a bithesitant about lawless places,&quot; says the director of AngloChinese Investment Co. &quot;The returns would have to be verygood indeed -- substantially higher than returns in HongKong, Singapore and Malaysia, on the order of two to 2 1/2times.&quot;   These contrasting views illustrate the mixed reaction tothe opening of China's stock market to foreigners followinglast month's debut placement of shares in China SouthernGlass Co. Some investors are so bullish on southern China'sgrowth potential that they are willing to shrug off doubtsabout Shenzhen's trading mechanisms and regulatoryambiguities. More-cautious investors, stung bydisappointments in other emerging markets, prefer to wait onthe sidelines until the new listings prove themselves.   In some ways, the development of Shenzhen's stock markethas mirrored the lightning development of the specialeconomic zone just north of Hong Kong. Shenzhen, the firstand largest of China's special economic zones set up to lureforeign investment with preferential tax treatment and otherincentives, has averaged 58% annual economic growth since1980 in its role as southern China's export-processingcenter. Huge inflows of foreign capital, particularly fromHong Kong manufacturers, have spawned a go-go attitude amongShenzhen companies that has led to rapid diversification intounrelated businesses and a thirst for more capital.   &quot;The corporate plan {of many Shenzhen companies} isn'tfixed,&quot; says Peter Phillips, a fund manager at FidelityInvestments Management (HK) Ltd. who just visited sixShenzhen companies due to issue shares. &quot;Things are movingquickly. {Shenzhen} companies are apt to sink money intoanything that takes off, which is probably more appropriatefor Shenzhen than {a rigid} MBA-type plan.&quot;   The Shenzhen stock market has rapidly overtaken its rivalin Shanghai, which opened six months earlier, in December1990. Shenzhen's market capitalization is now about triplethat of Shanghai's, and analysts at JF China Investment Co.say 96% of the estimated five billion renminbi (about $926million) of shares in Chinese companies to be issued toforeigners this year will derive from Shenzhen.   Last November, just four months after Shenzhen's officialdebut, Beijing said 11 companies would be added to the sixlisted on the Shenzhen exchange, sparking a stampede of localinvestors that resulted in hundreds queuing overnight forapplications to buy shares. Moreover, the government saidthese companies could issue separate new shares toforeigners, setting off a scramble among Hong Kongunderwriters to sign deals with the Shenzhen companies.   Beijing has kept foreigners out of the local &quot;A&quot; sharemarket for fear of huge foreign-exchange outflows. LocalChinese are likewise prohibited from buying the &quot;B&quot; sharescreated for foreigners. In theory, the parallel markets areto remain wholly independent of each other.   It was Shanghai Vacuum Electronic Device Co. that firstreceived Beijing's approval to sell B shares, but Shenzhen'sspeedy Southern Glass usurped the honors, completing itsprivate placement via Hoare Govett Asia Ltd. a full monthbefore the state-owned Shanghai company finished hagglingwith underwriters over the much larger $74 million issue,that was sold this month.   Thanks to hype in the Hong Kong media, some foreigninvestors have caught the fever. Hoare Govett on Dec. 19easily placed the 16 million shares in Southern Glass,representing 14.9% of the glassmaking venture between threemainland companies and Hong Kong's China Merchants SteamNavigation Co., a subsidiary of the mainland-based ChinaMerchants group.   For a narrowly focused investment holding company such asChina Assets Management Ltd., the Shenzhen shares offer aliquid trading position in southern China's dynamicindustrial sector, as well as the potential to ride themanufacturing wave even if the Hong Kong market goes flat.&quot;Political reasons have more bearing in Shenzhen thanexternal economic factors,&quot; says Frank Tsui, executivedirector of China Assets Management. &quot;The consensus is thatthe government is firmly supporting the development of themarket.&quot;   But many institutional investors spurn these bullisharguments, preferring to invest in Shenzhen's phenomenalgrowth via Hong Kong manufacturers with operations in theSEZ. &quot;At the moment, we can buy Shenzhen shares in Hong Kong,much cheaper than `B' shares,&quot; says Mr. Clark of AngloChinese Investment. &quot;I think it's better to follow amanufacturer in, who makes his own arrangements with theauthorities, than to go in as a Westerner. Most of theprestigious arrangements with multinationals in China havebeen disappointments.&quot;   Others on the sidelines point to China's lack of corporatelaw, Shenzhen's ambiguous trading mechanisms and the generaldifficulty of evaluating companies as the main reasons towait.   Some of the loudest grumbling stems from accountingquestions, despite the involvement of Arthur Andersen andamp; Co.in the Southern Glass issue. Amid the race to sell the first&quot;B&quot; shares to foreigners, the accounting firm was given only25 days to assess the company's performance. The finaldocument relies heavily on Chinese valuations, and someobservers say it doesn't match the standards of a typicalHong Kong new-issue prospectus, which usually takes threemonths to prepare.   One disparity is the description of the company'sthree-year track record, which is only partially auditedalong international standards.   Arthur Andersen contends that the document is sound. &quot;Theamount of time spent, the information obtained and theprocedures carried out are in no way less than what we wouldrequire in a Hong Kong listing,&quot; says Arthur Andersen partnerMeocre Li. Mr. Li adds that the Chinese valuations were onthe conservative side.</TEXT></DOC>
