Tokyo trading was moderate as a thin slice of the market, including some shipbuilders, steels, trading houses, and utilities, put in a good showing in the afternoon, but the broader market eased.    The Nikkei index closed at 27501.02, down 44.51 points, but up from a low on the session of around 27333. The Tokyo stock price index of all issues listed in the first section edged up, however, as it benefited from its unusually large concentration in large-capitalization issues. The index gained 4.00 to close at 2129.78. Volume on the first section was estimated at 950 million shares, up from 650 million Monday.    In the first 15 minutes of trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the Nikkei index rose 72.25 points to 27573.27.    Traders said investors stayed on the sidelines Tuesday despite the encouragingly lower interest rates on Japanese government bonds. Most weren't convinced that firmer bond prices, in the U.S. or Japan, will hold in the face of Friday's release of U.S. September unemployment data.    Investors fear the jobless data will show the U.S. economy still expanding at a rapid clip, and reignite inflationary concern.    Emperor Hirohito's deteriorating health also gives investors pause, according to traders, since it's impossible to be sure what will happen in the market when the monarch dies.    The 10 most active stocks were dominated by steel issues, which occupied the first six positions. Sumitomo Metal Industries was the most actively traded, rising 22 yen to 747 yen ($5.60) on volume of 194.5 million shares.    Traders gave various reasons for the exceptional interest in Sumitomo Metal. Some said it was merely that Sumitomo has lagged behind other steels, while others said the stock is recommended by a major Japanese brokerage.    Among other steels, Nippon Steel rose 20 to 805 on volume of 81.6 million, while Kobe Steel gained 29 yen to 636 yen.    London share prices settled higher in uneven trading as a lack of selling pressure and technical factors pushed shares up from intraday lows.    The majority of the session was spent drifting off intraday lows after early morning news of a rights issue and bid by Grand Metropolitan and the government-ordered reduction of the Kuwait Investment Office's stake in British Petroleum.    The Financial Times 100-share index settled 4.7 points higher at 1807.3. The narrower 30-share index was up 1.8 points at 1457.6. Volume was still at relatively slack levels, with 440 million shares changing hands, compared with the 337.4 million traded Monday.    Several dealers were at a loss to pinpoint the drift higher. &quot;I can see no reason why we're going better, except that we've simply reversed engines after this morning's slide,&quot; one equity salesman said.    The market's early weakness reflected concern about a #479 million ($815.3 million) rights issue by Grand Met to help finance an unsolicited $5.23 billion tender offer for Pillsbury Co. of the U.S.    Shares in Grand Met were among the major movers, falling 32 pence to 454 pence ($7.70) on news of the hefty bid for Pillsbury and the rights issue. Grand Met shares were heavily traded, with stock exchange figures showing 14 million shares traded by the close.    Sentiment also turned sour as the U.K. government ordered the Kuwaiti office to sharply reduce its holding in BP to 9.9% from the current 21.7% over a period of around 12 months.    The government decision triggered a flurry of trading in BP shares. The decision had been expected, but many analysts had predicted the Kuwaiti office would only be required to reduce its holding to around 15%. BP finished unchanged at 236.5 on volume of 14 million shares, after dropping to a low of 227.    Share prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange closed slightly higher in moderately active trading after a wave of buying in midsession offset early losses. The DAX index gained 3.14 points to close at 1245.58.    Equities opened lower amid a lack of buy orders, continuing Monday's sell-off, but investors returned to the market around midday and began snapping up stocks at the depressed levels.    Rumors that electronics giant Siemens AG is planning to raise its dividend for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 gave the market a boost, although Siemens isn't expected to announce its dividend until November. When Siemens cut its fiscal 1987 dividend last year, the stock dropped sharply and pulled the whole Frankfurt market lower.    Brokers reported similar dividend rumors for Volkswagen, which is expected to have its 1988 profit rise at least 9%. Siemens climbed 2.5 marks to 472.5 ($254), and Volkswagen rose 1.5 to 271.    The market is willing to react to positive company reports, said Heinz-Juergen Schaefer, a broker at Dresdner Bank AG. &quot;Fundamentally, everything is in good shape,&quot; he said. &quot;The technical factors are sometimes up, sometimes down, but the general picture is good.&quot;    Automobile and chemical shares closed slightly higher, but most machinery, steel and banking issues posted small losses.    Nixdorf continued to fall on reports that analysts are lowering their earnings forecasts for the computer maker. The stock dropped 4 to 408, after losing as much as 7 at the opening.    Elsewhere, stock prices closed higher in Amsterdam and Paris, mixed in Zurich and Milan, lower in Brussels and unchanged in Stockholm. Markets were described as dull and sluggish, with little news to move stocks.    Among Pacific markets, prices closed lower in Taipei, Sydney, Singapore, Hong Kong and Manila and were higher in Wellington and Seoul.    Taipei shares continued to decline as investors again stayed on the sidelines because of concern over the government's decision to reimpose a capital gains tax on stock profits next year. The plunge was the market's fifth consecutive decline, as the index has fallen 12.7%.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                       % This                                    Oct 3    Sep 30    Year   U.S. .......................... 250.0     250.6   +  9.0   Britain ....................... 544.4     551.2   +  5.6   Canada ........................ 355.9     356.1   +  1.5   Japan ........................ 1273.7    1289.0   + 24.6   France ........................ 397.0     396.1   + 37.6   Germany ....................... 194.3     195.6   + 24.1   Hong Kong .................... 1806.9    1812.7   +  9.9   Switzerland ................... 163.5     163.6   + 16.2   Australia ..................... 307.0     307.0   + 18.4   World index ................... 445.0     446.2   +  9.1</TEXT></DOC>
