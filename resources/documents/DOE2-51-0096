The findings were confirmedwith computed tomography and abdominal angiography. At surgery only thetumour of the right adrenal gland was removed. The histopathologic diagnosiswas pheochromocytoma. Postoperatively the symptoms and biochemistry wereunchanged and the patient was referred for further treatment. At ultrasonographyand abdominal aortography 6 remaining tumours were demonstrated. Surgerywas performed and 8 pheochromocytomas were extirpated (3 were closelyspaced small tumours in a conglomerate corresponding to one of the visualizedtumour sites). On histopathologic examination no signs of invasive growthwere found. The patient recovered completely. The blood pressure wasstill normal 2 1/2 years later. Angiography and non-invasive examinationof the entire abdomen and pelvis should be routine when pheochromocytomasare searched for.</TEXT></DOC>
