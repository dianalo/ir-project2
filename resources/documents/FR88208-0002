(3) Before selecting ENG INLET, when ice has accumulated.*<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>*Note: If icing conditions are entered in flight without theengine antiicing system having been selected, switch one ENGINE systemto ENG INLET ON position. If the engine runs satisfactorily, switch thesecond ENGINE system to the ENG INLET ON position and check that the secondengine continues to run satisfactorily. (4) Immediately, any time engine flameout occurs as a possible result ofice ingestion. (5) During approach and landing while in or shortly following flight inactual or potential icing conditions.  Caution Flight in actual or potential icing conditions will be limited by dutycycle of the ignition system. Ignition system time limits must be observedto prevent exceeding duty cycle times. Operator should verify these limitsfor his particular installation. For the purpose of this supplement, the following definition applies: ``Potential icing conditions in precipitation or visible moisture meteorologicalconditions: (1) Begin when the OAT is +5 anddegrees;C (+41 anddegrees;F) or colder, and(2) End when the OAT is +lO anddegrees;C (+50 anddegrees;F) or warmer.''
