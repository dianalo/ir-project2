The Republicans, running candidates for the first time in manycities of Baden-Wuerttemburg, often garnered more than 10 percentof the vote in Sunday's balloting, according to preliminary figures.   The results are expected to put further pressure on ChancellorHelmut Kohl's conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), whichlost more than 5 percent of the vote in the largest cities.   ``The Republicans won't improve anything. They will just makepolitics more difficult,'' said Stuttgart's CDU mayor, ManfredRommel, after the Republicans picked up its first five of the 60city council seats, or 9.6 percent of the vote.   The CDU lost four of its 24 seats in Stuttgart, the statecapital, falling from 38.8 percent to 33.1 percent of the vote.   More than 200 young protesters gathered in front of Stuttgart'scity hall Sunday night to demonstrate against the wins by theRepublicans, who are led by Franz Schoenhuber, a former Nazi WaffenSS soldier.   About 150 young leftist protesters stormed city hall inKarlsruhe, where the Republicans won 6.9 percent of the vote togain about four out of the 60 city council seats. No arrests orinjuries were immediately reported.   The Republicans garnered more than 10 percent of the vote inPforzheim and Heilbronn, and 14.2 percent in Heidenheim, all citiesof about 100,000 people. The party even picked up cities in thetraditional leftist stronghold of Freiburg.   Officials said final results were expected later in the week butemphasized they expected no significant changes from today'stallies.   Kohl's party has been buffeted by ultra-conservatives callingfor a tougher stance to win back voters from the Republicans, whilethe left has accused the CDU of already making too many concessionsto the far-right.   Republican victories date back to January, when the party won 11of the 138 seats in the West Berlin legislature. Since then theparty has gained city council seats in other major cities,including Cologne, Dortmund and Duesseldorf as well as in parts ofHesse state.   Founded in 1983, the Republicans have run on a platform oflaw-and-order and slashing the number of foreign workers in WestGermany. They won six seats in the European Parliament, taking 7.1percent of the vote in the West German voting in June.   Schoenhuber has said he expects the party will gain more than 5percent of the vote in national voting in December 1990 to enterthe federal Parliament in Bonn. Several public opinion polls haveindicated that may be an unrealistic goal.   Another rightist extremist group, the National Democratic Party,won seven seats in the Frankfurt city council in March.</TEXT></DOC>
