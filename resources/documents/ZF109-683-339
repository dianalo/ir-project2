 The magnetooptical disks are rewritable.andP;  Each cartridge holds 650Mbytes of data; however, only 325 Mbytes is accessible at a time because thedrives are single-sided.andP;  The total capacity of the library system is 20.8Gbytes.andP;  The system runs on a single-ended SCSI asynchronous bus, whichconforms to the SCSI II standard established for autochangers.andP;  The averageaccess time to load a disk from a storage position to a drive is sevenseconds.andM;The mechanical architecture of the autochanger excludes any electricalcomponents, cables, or connectors on the moving parts of the mechanism.andP;  This&quot;passive payload&quot; concept was chosen to maximize product reliability.andP;  Thedesign team set a goal at the onset of the project to have an absoluteminimum of sensors, solenoids, and motors.andP;  The final design has only twomotors, no solenoids, and three optical sensors.andP;  The sensors are used in thevertical calibration of the system and in the mailslot.andM;Physical size was determined early in the product design to allow use in twoorientations.andP;  In the normal orientation, the autochanger fits into an HPrack.andP;  It can also be laid on its side and used in an industry-standard19-inch rack.andP;  This two-orientation requirement established the height,width, and depth of the product.andP;  Meeting these space constraints was apersistent challenge in the design of the subsystems.andM;Adding to these design challenges were the need to ensure HP quality and thetime constraints of an aggressive schedule.andM;Fig.andP;  1 shows the mechanical layout of the autochanger.andM;Mechanical FunctionsandM;There are two basic mechanical functions of the product.andP;  First, the user canload or remove a cartridge via the mailslot.andP;  Second, the cartridges aremoved from storage slots and the mailslot to drives and vice versa via thepicker mechanism.andP;  These functions are implemented using two motors andassociated subsystems.andP;  All movement in the product has been grouped into twotypes: Y or vertical motion and Z or horizontal motion.andP;  Y Motion.andP;  Allmovement up and down along the vertical ways is labeled Y motion.andP;  It isdriven by a dc servo motor and a vertically mounted leadscrew.andP;  A smalltoothed belt drives the vertical leadscrew through a reduction gear.andP;  Thevertical carriage is attached to the leadscrew.andM;The vertical carriage is made up of the horizontal carriage, picker, andtranslate mechanisms.andP;  All of these mechanisms are powered by a toothed beltcalled the T belt.andP;  Z Motion.andP;  The Z or horizontal plane is the plane inwhich the following motions occur:andM;*  Plunge.andP;  The picker plunges to get a cartridge from a drive or slot or toput a cartridge into a drive or slot.andP;  The picker is the cartridge carrier,that is, the device that holds a cartridge that is being moved between astorage slot and a drive.andM;*  Flip.andP;  The picker is caused to rotate 180 degrees.andM;*  Translate.andP;  The system has two stacks of cartridges.andP;  In a translate move,the Y and Z systems are positioned to move the picker and the horizontalcarriage-on which the picker is mounted-from stack to stack.andP;  Translatemotions occur only at the lowest vertical position of the vertical carriage.andM;* Mailslot Actuation.andP;  This is a special plunge with picker side and verticalpositioning.andM;All Z motion occurs within or as part of the vertical carriage.andP;  All Z motionis driven by the T belt, which is attached to the Z motor and orientedperpendicularly to the vertical carriage assembly.andM;The plunge occurs in the picker mechanism.andP;  This motion is driven by the Tbelt through a gear attached to the picker leadscrew.andP;  The flip is requiredbecause the disks are double-sided and the drives are single-sided.andP;  Thetranslate occurs through a special combination of Y position and releasemechanisms on the vertical carriage.andP;  When all of the proper conditions aremet the Z motor will drive the horizontal carriage from one stack to theother.andP;  Mailslot actuation occurs at a particular vertical height, sensed bymating actuators on the picker mechanism and the mailslot.andP;  When all of theproper conditions are met a plunge motion of the picker actuates themailslot.andM;Vertical CarriageandM;As described earlier, the cartridge holder (picker) must be able to move inthe vertical direction to any magazine or drive slot.andP;  It must also be ableto move to one of the two horizontal positions.andP;  The vertical carriage is themechanism that constrains these motions.andP;  It is designed to hold the end ofthe cartridge holder in close tolerance despite variations of the sheet-metalstructure that forms the enclosure for the product and to which all of theother parts are mounted and referenced.andP;  The vertical carriage is light inweight to reduce dynamic forces.andP;  It is designed to be installed and removedeasily and to have a high degree of reliability.andP;  The biggest challenge inits design proved to be designing it to fit into a 375-mm box structure.andM;The vertical carriage is shown in Fig.andP;  2.andP;  It is guided in its verticalmotion by a set of angled rails, which attach to the structure, as shown inFig.andP;  1.andP;  The vertical carriage consists of:andM;* A set of bearing blocks with roller bearings, which roll on the railsandM;* Plastic carriage blocks, which hold the bearing blocks, the T belt pulleys,and the horizontal rod and wayandM;* The horizontal rod and way, which provide the translate means for thehorizontal carriage and picker.andM;In the breadboard design, a 0.75-inch-diameter rod and a linear bearing wereused for the vertical transport.andP;  However, because of the volume limitations,this design proved difficult to implement.andP;  To solve this problem and meetmanufacturing requirements, the rail and roller bearing approach was chosen.andO;The main problem this design faced was the variations of the sheet-metalstructure.andP;  To account for these variations, the right-side bearing blocksare constrained in the carriage block but are spring-loaded (floating)between the vertical rail and the carriage block.andP;  This allows the assemblyto correct for up to a millimeter of structure variation and still maintainthe reference against the left rail, which always serves as the verticalreference surface.andM;A steel bearing block linkage is used to stiffen the vertical carriageassembly relative to the vertical rails.andP;  The bearing block linkage ties thetwo floating bearing blocks together to ensure that their motion always actsto tighten the vertical carriage within the vertical rails.andM;Because of the limited volume, the left-side rail has to perform severalfunctions.andP;  Half-inch holes in the bottom of the extruded aluminum railprovide for mounting the bearings and shaft.andP;  This assembly has space forgearing in the back and the drive gear for the T belt in the front.andP;  At thetop, a quarter-inch slotted hole in the rail and a plastic slider that fitsaround it provide a belt tensioner.andP;  The top T belt idler pulley is placedthrough the slider and rail, and is spring-loaded upwards to provide properbelt tension.andP;  Because the belt places a moment on the slider, it will lockup when momentary high forces are encountered.andP;  This keeps the belt fromslipping when the drive system encounters the high force spikes sometimesseen during magazine and drive insertions.andM;The bearing blocks provided several design challenges.andP;  The first problem wasrunning the bearings on the aluminum rails.andP;  This was very noisy and causedthe aluminum to wear.andP;  Plastic tires were placed on the bearings, butdeveloped flat spots in storage temperature testing.andP;  Plastic with bettercreep qualities was tried, but showed fatigue failures short of the requiredlife.andM;For the final design, the plastic is Delrin and the tires are redesigned toincrease their surface contact area.andP;  The bearing blocks were originallydesigned to be made of aluminum, but the aluminum tended to gall whilesliding in the carriage blocks, and was much higher in cost than initiallyexpected.andP;  Therefore, an all-plastic design was conceived, using bearingblocks made of polyphenylene sulfide with 40% glass.andP;  This design works muchbetter.andP;  It results in lower friction, lower wear, better tolerances betweenmating parts, and a significant cost savings.andM;The carriage blocks tie the horizontal rod and way together structurally,hold the T belt pulleys, and provide the sliding constraints for the bearingblocks.andP;  Glass-filled polycarbonate helps reduce the carriage blocks' weightand cost.andP;  Because the carriage blocks are the stops for translate motions ofthe horizontal carriage, the distance between the blocks is set by machinedfeatures in the horizontal rod and way, which are held securely in place bycrush bumps in the plastic blocks and then bonded for added rigidity.andP;  Oncethe vertical carriage is installed between the side rails, the carriageblocks cannot separate.andM;The horizontal rod is a three-eighths-inch hardened stainless-steel rod.andP;  Thehorizontal way at the bottom of the vertical carriage is a machined aluminumL-section bar.andP;  The top of the L section is a track for roller bearings onthe horizontal carriage and the bottom of the L section provides a latch thatholds the horizontal carriage in the appropriate translate positions.andP;  Thealuminum way also provides a mounting surface for a portion of the translatelock assembly.andP;  This way was originally to be extruded, but the addedmachining made this less cost-effective than a completely machined part.andM;Horizontal CarriageandM;The horizontal carriage supports the picker and translates it from onecartridge stack to the other.andP;  The support structure for the horizontalcarriage allows linear motion in one axis while excluding linear motion intwo axes and rotational motion in three axes.andP;  A rigid structure is necessaryto ensure proper alignment of the picker for cartridge exchanges.andM;The horizontal carriage is supported by the following parts of the verticalcarriage: the horizontal rod, the horizontal way, the two carriage blocks,the four bearing blocks, and the bearing block linkage on the spring-loaded(right) side.andP;  Fig.andP;  3 shows the horizontal carriage and picker mounted onthe vertical carriage.andM;A machined aluminum casting controls picker alignment and serves as amounting surface for the flip support, the translation lock assembly, the hublock assembly, two idler shafts, two bearings for the main picker shaft, twotire shafts, and two linear bearings for translation capabilities.andP;  Rigidityand spatial concerns top the list of design requirements.andP;  The hardened,ground, steel horizontal rod supports the horizontal carriage linearbearings.andP;  Two tires on roller bearings, mounted beneath the horizontalcarriage, ride on the front and rear surfaces of the aluminum horizontal way(L bar) to control rotation about the rod.andM;Translate MechanismandM;The translate motion-moving a cartridge from one side of the autochanger tothe other-requires a combination of the vertical and horizontal motions.andO;There were six design goals for the translate mechanism.andP;  First, in line withthe passive payload concept, the movement must only use the two servo motorsand require no additional sensors or solenoids to clutter a clean andreliable design.andP;  Second, the mechanism must be reliable to one millioncartridge exchanges.andP;  This requires a translate mechanism life of 1.5 milliontranslates because, on the average, there are 1.5 translates per exchange.andO;Third, no more than 6 mm of Y motion can be used to actuate the translatemechanism.andP;  Fourth, the design must minimize wear through proper selection ofmaterials and geometry.andP;  Fifth, the design must be fault tolerant.andP;  Thisfault tolerance must include the ability to recover from power failures atall times.andP;  Sixth, the design must allow translates at both the top andbottom vertical positions to provide architectural flexibility, although inthe current product, translates only occur at the bottom.andM;The translate mechanism (see Fig.andP;  4) consists of the vertical carriageincluding the horizontal carriage and the horizontal way with adjustablestops, and the translate lock mechanism.andP;  The translate lock mechanism (Fig.andO;5) consists of:andM;* A translate lock arm, which pivots in and out of a slot in the verticalcarriage's horizontal wayandM;* A hublock, which can engage a notch in the picker hub to prevent the hubfrom rotatingandM;* A translate bar fixed in the structure, which pushes the lock open.andM;Both the translate lock arm and the hublock are mounted on the horizontalcarriage.andP;  They are independently spring-loaded downward for the normal caseof the horizontal carriage being locked in place and the plunge motionallowed.andM;The translate lock mechanism has to hold the horizontal carriage rigidlyfixed normally, and ensure that only one motion at a time can occur, eithertranslate or plunge.andP;  Ensuring only singular motion is necessary becausethere are no sensors to tell the system what the picker and horizontalcarriage are actually doing, so the servo could conceivably get &quot;lost&quot;without this stipulation.andP;  Fig.andP;  6 shows the two basic locked positions:plunge allowed and translate prevented or translate allowed and plungeprevented.andM;The translate lock arm pivots on a horizontal axis contained within thehorizontal carriage.andP;  The translate lock arm is spring-loaded to pivotdownward, which forces the arm into a slot in the horizontal way and locksthe horizontal carriage, and therefore the picker, to one side of thevertical carriage or the other.andP;  To minimize wear from the sliding motions,the translate lock arm has a needle bearing on its far end for contacting thetranslate bar and a molded wear pad closer to the center that contacts thehublock.andP;  The translate bar is rigidly attached to the sheet-metal structureand is the contact surface that actuates the translate lock arm.andP;  The hublockis another downwardly springloaded, pivoting arm that is responsible forlocking the hub when actuated by contact with the translate lock arm.andP;  Thehub is part of the plunge mechanism so that locking the hub results inlocking the plunge mechanism.andP;  Locking the hub locks the horizontal carriageto the T belt so that the Z servo can move the entire horizontal carriageinstead of just actuating the plunge motion.andP;  The translate movement can bestbe described if split into four phases.andP;  In phase 1, the Z motor lines up aslot in the hub with the hublock, allowing for its eventual insertion.andP;  The Yservo lowers the entire vertical carriage assembly, causing the translatelock arm to contact and be pivoted upward by the translate bar.andP;  Thetranslate lock arm in turn contacts the hublock, moving the hublock into thehub slot and locking the hub and the plunger.andP;  At the end of phase 1, boththe plunge and translate motions are locked.andP;  This overlapping of the twolocks is a reliability feature that prevents the Z servo from freewheelingand losing track of where the picker is.andP;  The servo is always in positivecontrol.andM;In phase 2, when the hub is securely locked, the translate lock arm is liftedfree and clear of the stops on the horizontal way to allow the Z servo totranslate the horizontal carriage across the vertical carriage.andP;  Phase 2 iscompleted when the Y servo saturates' as a result of the vertical carriage'shitting the hard stop of the translate bar at the bottom of the structure,thus ending the vertical movement.andP;  No sensor is required to end the verticalmovement, thus contributing to reliability and simplicity.andM;In phase 3, the Y servo is stationary while the Z servo drives the horizontalcarriage from one side to the other.andP;  The needle bearing on the translatelock arm rides on the translate bar.andP;  This allows the tab on the translatelock arm to clear the horizontal way along the entire path.andP;  The design hasto be tolerant of a possible power failure, since it would be very easy toget into an unrecoverable position at this time.andP;  To this end, the translatelock arm geometry is such that if the vertical carriage rises, as it wouldafter a power failure, the Z servo can still pull the horizontal carriage toone side and have the tab on the translate lock arm lock into the stop.andP;  Thisis another major reason why the hublock and the translate lock can neverphysically be unlocked at the same time, even in the worst-case toleranceconditions.andP;  Phase 3 ends with the Z servo saturating with the horizontalcarriage against the opposite side of the vertical carriage, therebyfinishing the translation part of the move.andM;The Z servo continues to saturate throughout phase 4, while the Y servo movesthe vertical carriage upward.andP;  This movement allows the translate lock arm todrop into the beveled stop in the horizontal way, which locks the horizontalcarriage.andP;  The hublock does not follow the translate lock arm downwardbecause it is held in place through friction by the saturating Z servo.andP;  Thisensures that the horizontal carriage is in direct contact with the side,allowing reliable locking of the translate lock arm.andP;  A bevel in the stopeliminates the possibility that any burr in the lock arm will cause it tohang up.andP;  The stop is adjusted during assembly to ensure that the horizontalcarriage does not float sideways in the locked position.andP;  When the verticalcarriage has moved vertically far enough to allow the needle bearing on thetranslate lock arm to separate from the translate bar, the Z servo comes outof saturation and allows the hublock to fall back down onto the translatelock arm.andP;  The translate move is now complete, freeing the autochanger toperform whatever other moves are requested.andM;PickerandM;Like the rest of the autochanger, the cartridge retrieval mechanism isdesigned with simplicity in mind to help meet both reliability and costgoals.andP;  The mechanism requires four degrees of motion within a small formfactor: in/out plunge, grasp/release cartridge, side-to-side translate, and180-degree flip.andP;  In spite of all the motions, it was felt that the pickerhad to have a passive payload, that is, no motors, solenoids, or sensors onthe moving platform, for the highest possible reliability.andM;Fig.andP;  7 shows the basic layout of the mechanism.andP;  It consists of six maincomponents or subassemblies:andM;* The vertical carriage, which connects to the vertical leadscrew, providingthe up/down motionandM;* The horizontal carriage, which holds the cartridge picker mechanism, fliplatch, and translate lock arm, and translates from side to sideandM;* The picker hub, which converts the belt motion to picker plunge motionandM;* The picker itself, which can grab and hold a cartridgeandM;* The translate lock mechanism, which either holds the horizontal carriagefixed or allows it to translate from side to sideandM;* The flip latch mechanism, which holds the picker flat during plunges butcan allow the picker to be flipped 180 degrees.andM;The picker hub is a single plastic molded piece with three functionalsections.andP;  The back portion is a pulley, which the belt from the motorengages to provide all the power to the horizontal carriage and picker.andP;  Thefront is a gear, which mates with a smaller gear on the end of the picker'sleadscrew to convert the belt motion to picker plunge motion.andP;  Finally, thecenter section has two cutouts 180 degrees apart which are used by thetranslation latch to lock the hub.andP;  The belt is the only power source for theentire picker mechanism, and the encoder on the motor moving the belt is theonly method of sensing anything on the horizontal carriage.andP;  The pickermechanism design was heavily influenced by space constraints.andP;  The width ofthe sheet-metal structure limited both picker width and picker height(because of flips).andP;  Short structure-length constraints and long minimumplunge depth requirements necessitated a compact cartridge graspingmechanism.andP;  In addition, the front-panel openings in the magnetoopticaldrives limited where the picker could grab the cartridge and required thatwhatever inserted the disk had to go well past the drive front panel.andO;Another concern was how to handle misalignments, particularly as thecartridge was loaded into the drive.andM;With these concerns in mind, the picker was designed to mimic a hand pushinga cartridge into a drive.andP;  &quot;Fingers&quot; grab the cartridge from either the driveor a magazine, and the &quot;thumb&quot; pushes the disk back into place.andP;  Theleadscrew's nut floats within the thumb, providing the muscle.andP;  (The nut isnot rigidly attached to the thumb to allow for leadscrew runout and generalpart variations.) The finger mounts into the thumb, which in turn rides in aplastic shell that has tracks to guide the finger to grab or release thecartridge.andP;  Identical thumbs, fingers, and shell halves are used on bothsides to form the whole grasping mechanism.andP;  Fig.andP;  8 shows the two paths thefingers can take depending on their initial position.andP;  The fingers arespring-loaded to a normally rotated-in position.andP;  When the fingers move outand contact the cartridge, they are sprayed outward and grab the disk.andP;  Inthe track, a one-way gate turns the system into a type of mechanicalflip-flop.andP;  This gate, a molded spring, is forced downward as the fingertravels over it from the drive side, but will not move down when the fingerscome from the picker side.andP;  Thus, with the next plunge, the fingers mustfollow the release path and are rotated out to release the cartridge.andP;  Thecenter of the thumb then pushes the cartridge to its final position.andP;  As thethumb retracts, the fingers spring around again to their normally closedposition, ready to grab a cartridge on the next plunge.andM;Materials were an interesting challenge in the picker design.andM;The one-way gate is made of Ultem, which has high strength, good wearqualities, and low creep-important characteristics for a preloaded, highlycycled spring.andP;  The fingers, thumbs, and sleeves all require low-wearingmaterials, and since these parts slide against each other, each has to be ofa different material.andP;  The fingers also require high strength, so they aremade of 35% long glass, 15% Teflon polycarbonate.andP;  The thumbs have the mostparts sliding against them (leadscrew nuts, sleeves, and fingers) and requiregood flatness, so they are molded of 30% glass, 15% Teflon Nylon 6/10.andP;  Thesleeves, which are part of the electrostatic discharge path for any chargethat might build up on the picker and affect the cartridge, are molded of 10%carbon, 15% Teflon polycarbonate.andM;Flip MechanismandM;The objectives in designing the flip latch mechanism were to use alreadyexisting motion and to limit the flip to 180 degrees.andP;  Using the rotation ofthe picker hub without moving the leadscrew satisfies the first objective,and smart hard stops satisfy the second.andP;  Fig.andP;  9 shows the main parts of thelatch: the pivot arm, the release arm, and the cam.andP;  In normal picker plungemotions, a nib on the rear of the picker shell is trapped between the pivotarm on the bottom and the cam on the top.andP;  This keeps the picker flat withrespect to the drives and magazines.andP;  Fig.andP;  10 shows the steps involved inopening and closing the lock during a flip.andP;  To flip, the thumb plungesbackwards, pushing the release arm, which is mounted on the pivot arm.andO;Although the release arm can rotate downward on the pivot arm, the thumb,pushing backward on the release arm, forces the pivot arm to rotate backwardalso, allowing the nib to fall down through.andP;  As the belt continues to rotatethe hub, the picker's leadscrew bottoms out when the thumb can move back nofarther.andP;  Thus the entire picker rotates with the hub.andP;  As soon as the nibhas cleared the pivot arm, the arm springs back to its normal position.andP;  Atthe end of the flip, the nib from the other side comes around, opens the cam,and is stopped by the pivot arm.andP;  The thumb, which originally pushed therelease arm backward, now pushes it down.andP;  With the release arm down, thepicker cannot flip again until the lock is rearmed, that is, until the thumbplunges out far enough to allow the release arm to spring back up again.andM;Stress loads, space, tolerance build-up, and fail-safe once-only actuationwere the major concerns in the design of the flip mechanism.andP;  Long fiberglassmaterial in both the cam and the pivot arm gives the parts superior wear andimpact strength.andP;  The orientation of the latch parts not only economizesspace but puts the impact loading down onto the pivot shaft for minimalbending stresses.andP;  The cam allows for variations in parts and any wear in usewhile maintaining the picker fixed during plunge operations.andP;  The back sideof the release arm is designed to help prevent accidental double flips.andP;  Whenthe release arm is rotated just slightly, the back no longer aligns with athrough hole in the lock's support bracket.andP;  This prevents the pivot arm fromrotating and eliminates the possibility that the impact at the end of theflip might cause the flip latch to open again.andM;MailslotandM;The mailslot is a mechanism that allows the user to install a cartridge inthe autochanger just as if it were being put into a drive.andP;  For the picker tograb the disk cartridge, the mailslot mechanism must rotate the cartridge 180degrees.andM;The part of the mailslot that accepts and delivers cartridges is called thecarrier.andP;  In the out position, the carrier extends the cartridgeapproximately 20 mm out from the front panel for ease of removal by the user.andO;When a cartridge is installed and pushed flush with the front panel, a springmechanism catches, giving the user a stop position.andP;  As this position isreached, a sensor trips, indicating that the mailslot has a cartridgeinstalled.andP;  The picker then moves to the correct height to activate themechanism.andP;  Using the picker to activate the mailslot eliminates the need foranother motor in the system.andM;The mailslot rotates the cartridge using forces applied through the pickerand an actuator (see Fig.andP;  11).andP;  The actuator is approximately at the centerof mass of the cartridge and the carrier, thereby keeping the forces in astraight line.andP;  The leadscrew nut on the picker drives the actuator.andP;  Theactuator and the carrier run in tracks molded into the top and bottom piecesof the mailslot.andP;  The tracks are designed so that as the actuator drives thethe carrier from front to back in the mailslot, the carrier is rotated 180degrees.andM;The cartridge load sequence consists of the following moves:andM;1 .User pushes load buttonandM;2.andP;  Move picker to mailslot actuate heightandM;3.andP;  Plunge to maximum get positionandM;4.andP;  Check for sensor sensing cartridge in mailslotandM;5  Rotate mail inandM;6.andP;  Move to get-mail heightandM;7.andP;  Plunge to get cartridgeandM;8.andP;  Pull cartridge into pickerandM;9.andP;  (Sequence of moves to put cartridge into drive or magazine)andM;10.andP;  Move to mailslot actuate heightandM;11.andP;  Rotate mail out.andM;When the carrier is facing the inside of the autochanger, it looks likeanother magazine slot to the picker.andP;  When the carrier is facing the outsideit looks like a drive to the user.andP;  A special catch mechanism between theactuator and the mailslot top keeps the carrier from moving when either theuser or the picker is pushing or pulling on the cartridge, but allows thecarrier to be rotated and moved when the picker is pushing or pulling on theactuator.andP;  In other words, the carrier has limit positions on both sides ofthe mailslot, and the actuator must be the moving device to move the carrierpast these limit positions.andM;Because the carrier slides in the top and bottom pieces of the mailslot, thewear of the carrier against these parts required special materialsconsiderations.andP;  The carrier and actuator needed to be different from the topand bottom, but all parts were to be molded.andP;  For regulatory reasons, all ofthe materials had to be self-extinguishing when exposed to flame.andP;  The topand bottom are made of polycarbonate with glass and Teflon fillers.andO;Polycarbonate is used because of its low cost, since these are the twolargest parts.andP;  The Teflon (PTFE) is put in for friction reduction.andP;  Theglass is added because the parts need to be flat and strong enough to holdthe whole assembly while the user or picker pushes on the mechanism fromeither side.andP;  A special milled glass fiber was chosen as a filler because ittends to produce flatter parts (+ or - 0.2 mm across the part) and adds therequired stiffness.andP;  The carrier and actuator are both molded out ofpolyethersulfone (PES) with Teflon filler.andP;  PES has several characteristicsthat are needed in the part design.andP;  It is very dimensionally stablematerial.andP;  The PES and polycarbonate materials wear against each other verywell.andP;  PES can be color matched to the custom color required by HP.andP;  Also,PES can be ultrasonically welded.andP;  The carrier is approximately 120 mm deepover a section 11 mm high.andP;  Molding this would be very difficult if notimpossible, so the carrier is made in two pieces and the two are weldedtogether.andM;To assemble the mailslot, all parts are either added to the top half of theenclosure or placed directly into the bottom half.andP;  The top and bottom arethen screwed together.andM;MagazinesandM;The four magazines in the HP Series 6300 Model 20GB/A rewritable optical disklibrary system each hold eight magnetooptical disk cartridges (Fig.andP;  12).andO;The magazines must hold the cartridges in position for the picker to removeand replace them without too much force, but they must also hold thecartridges while the machine is physically moved.andP;  The magazines are designedso that referencing and alignment are correct when the assembly is insertedinto the structure.andM;The alternative of molding the magazine assemblies in one part was ruled outbecause of schedule constraints and tooling costs.andP;  Minimum wear on thecartridge contact surfaces required a plastic part, and for ease of assemblywe use a sheet-metal mating part.andP;  The entire magazine assembly uses onlythree parts: a plastic part used four times, a sheet metal part used twice,and a plastic screw used eight times.andP;  Details needed for holding thecartridges are easily created in the plastic part.andP;  Sheet metal is aninexpensive and effective way of holding the plastic parts together andreferencing them into the structure.andM;The plastic guide in the magazine assembly is made of polycarbonate with 10%PTFE (Teflon) and 10% aramid (Kevlar) fibers.andP;  The Teflon is added forfriction reduction.andP;  Testing during product development showed that thestandard cartridge case made of ABS wore too easily against even thelubricated guide, so the cartridge cases were changed to polycarbonate.andO;Extensive testing has shown making both the cartridge case and the guide ofpolycarbonate is acceptable because of the lubrication in the guide.andM;The aramid is an additive for dimensional stability.andP;  During molding, thearamid ensures that the part shrinkage is the same in both flow directions.andO;This keeps the plastic guide stable in all of its required referencing tasks.andO;The cartridge is spaced and held vertically by the guide.andP;  The catch detailsfor holding the cartridge are molded into this part and close tolerances areneeded for a proper snap fit.andP;  The plastic molding process allows a designthat lowers insertion force but keeps the removal force at desired levels.andO;Fig.andP;  12 shows the cantilever spring and cartridge snap details.andM;The autochanger is designed for a million exchanges.andM;Therefore, the springs designed into the guides must have a long fatiguelife.andP;  The Kevlar is helpful in this area, but not as much as fiberglasswould be.andP;  A trade-off of dimensional stability for part strength andtherefore fatigue life was made in the choice of materials.andP;  This trade-offhas required testing to ensure that the spring life is at least 150,000cycles per spring.andP;  Considerable testing has established that the part meetsthe requirement.andP;  The cantilever springs are designed for constant stressover their entire length.andM;The sheet-metal part is a horizontally symmetric part that holds the plasticparts together and allows easy installation of the assembly into thestructure.andP;  This part is folded such that the side plastic parts areaccurately located with respect to the reference surfaces on the sides of thestructure.andP;  This reference scheme keeps the tolerances between the magazinesand other critical elements to a minimum.andP;  Once the magazine assembly isbuilt, it can only be installed correctly into the machine.andP;  Hard-tooling ofthe sheet-metal part reduced magazine location errors and improvedperformance of the unit during of the course of testing and design.andM;AcknowledgmentsandM;Special thanks to Dave jones and Doug Fleece, whose efforts helped thisproject meet its goals.andP;  Dave, who worked on the project from the beginning,designed the sheet-metal enclosure and did the product design.andP;  He was also agreat help with a lot of good ideas in many areas.andP;  Doug, who came on theproject later and finished up in some needed areas, designed the front bezeland mailslot door and finished up several smaller parts.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
