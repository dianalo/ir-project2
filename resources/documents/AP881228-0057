No Israeli troops were hurt in the clash, the spokesman said oncondition of anonymity.   The clash began at about 3 a.m. in the Israeli-controlled``security zone'' near the village of Meiss el-Jabal. It was nearthe site where paratroopers killed three other guerrillas this week.   In Sidon, Lebanon, the Palestinian Liberation Front said three ofits guerrillas crossed the border into northern Israel today andclashed with Israeli troops for six hours. It said the fate of theattackers was unknown.   The front, whose leader, Taalat Yacoub, died of a heart attacklast month, is a small radical faction of Yasser Arafat's PalestineLiberation Organization.   Maj. Gen. Yossi Peled, head of Israel's northern command, saidthe guerrillas were trying to cross the border to launch an attackon Kibbutz Manara, a collective farm community 100 yards from thesite of the clash.   ``When they get within meters of a settlement it is easy tofigure out what their goal was. Their goal was the settlement,''Peled said on Israel radio.   The front's statement said the attack was ``dedicated as amemorial for Yacoub, a champion of armed struggle to liberatePalestine.'' Yacoub had his political headquarters in Syria and amilitary base at the Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp near Sidon insouthern Lebanon.   The statement did not specify what the guerrillas' target was,only that they clashed with Israeli forces.   It was the third infiltration attempt this week and the thirdsince the United States agreed to a dialogue with the PLO on Dec.14, after Arafat announced he was renouncing terrorism.   On Monday, Israeli paratroopers killed three guerrillas nearMeiss el Jabal. Three other guerrillas drowned in a rubber dinghyoff the coast of Lebanon the same day as they tried to make theirway to Israel, the army said.   A paratrooper identified only as ``Capt. Yair,'' told Israelradio the guerrillas killed today apparently were trying to use thecover of stormy weather, rain and fog to infiltrate Israel.   ``They come in any weather. This kind of weather makes it harderfor us, and they assume they can take advantage of it,'' he said.``Now the problem is when the next attempt will come.''   Troops found machine guns and ammunition with the guerrillas andwire cutters they apparently planned to use to cut the border fence,the army spokesman said.   Israel carved out its security zone, a six-to-10-mile wide bufferstrip in southern Lebanon, in 1985 when it withdrew the bulk of itstroops from Lebaon. It is jointly patrolled by Israeli soldiers andthe South Lebanon Army, an Israeli-backed militia.   The Palestine National Council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile,last month endorsed a 1985 declaration by the PLO that it wouldrestrict its attacks to military targets inside Israel and theoccupied territories.   The front, along with other factions in the PLO, approved that.But it has made no comment on Arafat's later declaration renouncingterrorism.   The United States has said it will break off the talks with thePLO if the movement is found to be implicated in terrorist attacks.   Several dissident Syrian-backed Palestinian factions, who are notmembers of the PLO, have denounced Arafat's declaration as abetrayal of the Palestinian cause and vowed to continue the ``armedstruggle'' against Israel.</TEXT></DOC>
