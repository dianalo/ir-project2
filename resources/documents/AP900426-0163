The tank, which fell into disrepair after closing in 1987, isthe only one of its kind in North America that accommodatesfull-scale oil cleanup equipment. Research there has produced mostof what experts know about oil spill response.   Officials hope to reopen the Oil and Hazardous MaterialsSimulated Environmental Test Tank near the Earle Naval WeaponsStation by 1991.   ``This is a milestone event for oil spill containment andcleanup research operations,'' said Barry A. Williamson, directorof the Interior Department's Minerals Management Service.   He and Navy Rear Adm. Robert Ailes, deputy commander of theNaval Sea Systems Command, signed documents Thursday transferringcontrol of the facility to the Minerals Management Service for fiveyears.   Following oil spills in Prince William Sound in Alaska and alongthe Delaware River, politicians began focusing attention onreactivating the wave-generating tank, which simulates open waterconditions for testing prototypes of booms and small skimmers.   Jim Nash, a former engineer at the facility, has estimated itwill cost $500,000 to resume operations. at the tank, which is 667feet long, 67 feet wide and 8 feet deep.   According to Thursday's agreement, the cost of operating thetank will be shared by the Minerals Management Service, the CoastGuard and Environment Canada, which is Canada's environmentaldepartment.   Angela Calos, a spokeswoman for Minerals Management, declined todisclose how much money is being set aside for the project, butsaid the American Petroleum Institute indicated willingness tounderwrite some research at the facility.</TEXT></DOC>
