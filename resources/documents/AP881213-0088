(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Tests have found no dangerous substances inthe air at the headquarters of USA Today, where 14 workers are saidto have suffered miscarriages in the last 15 months, the paper'seditor says.   Editor Peter S. Prichard said Monday that the preliminary resultswere provided by an outside testing firm that tested newsrooms atUSA Today's Arlington headquarters over the last two weeks.   He said that additional testing will be done.   USA Today employees said last week that an informal survey foundthat 14 women who work on the 14th and 15th floors of the buildinghad suffered miscarriages since September 1987. The employees wereconcerned that major remodeling which began in April contributed toseveral of the miscarriages.   ``We're continuing to look at it,'' Prichard told The WashingtonPost. ``We don't know the cause (of the miscarriages) and we'recontinuing to try to find out.''   Prichard told employees of the preliminary test results at ameeting Monday. He also said other floors at the newspaper, owned byGannett Co. Inc., will be tested and that an epidemiologist has beenhired to study the cluster of miscarriages.   In a memo summarizing the results, Prichard said theenvironmental firm found the air ``is cleaner than the air in mostbuildings.''   A memo last week signed by Madelyn P. Jennings, USA Today'ssenior vice president for personnel, said the newspaper will alsotest the effects of video display terminals used by employees.</TEXT></DOC>
