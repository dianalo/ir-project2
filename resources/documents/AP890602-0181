Former vice squad officers Shelton Roberts and James WhitakerJr. also were charged with allegedly obstructing courts in theDistrict of Columbia by filing false affidavits in support ofsearch warrants in drug investigations. In addition, they wereaccused of obstructing a federal grand jury investigation of theiralleged illegal activities.   Information compiled in the probe against a dozen other formervice squad officers has been turned over to the police departmentfor ``appropriate administrative action,'' said U.S. Attorney JayStephens. His office announced the federal grand jury indictments.   Stephens said the referrals were made because his investigationdidn't establish sufficient credible evidence to prosecute theother police officers.   The lengthy investigation focused on the city's 4th policeprecinct vice unit.   Indictments against Roberts and Whitaker say they defrauded aconfidential police fund set up to pay for narcotics purchases andto pay informants.   Roberts and Whitaker allegedly forged and falsified policedocuments, saying that in many instances the controlled buysweren't made or informants didn't receive the money as claimed byRobert and Whitaker.   In 1986 and 1987, Roberts was involved in 121 alleged forgerieswhile Whitaker was involved in 87, the indictments said.   As a result of allegedly falsified affidavits, the U.S.attorney's office said in 1987 that it would dismiss 300 to 400pending drug cases ``in order to preserve the integrity of thecriminal justice system.''   In addition, the indictments say that Roberts and Whitaker madefalsely sworn affidavits to support issuance of search warrants indrug investigations.   The affidavits recounted drug buys that didn't take place andprovided facts supporting the reliability of informants that wereuntrue, the indictments said.   Roberts was charged with six counts of obstruction of thefederal investigation while Whitaker was charged with two counts ofobstructing it.   A 167-count indictment was returned against Whitaker and a161-count indictment was returned against Roberts.   If convicted on all the charges, Robert and Whitaker could faceup to life imprisonment.</TEXT></DOC>
