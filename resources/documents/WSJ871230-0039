It certainly isn't a household word like Ford or Coca-Cola. Just alphabetizing it requires some hard choices.    But for half the trading day yesterday, E-II was the most active stock. Its second trade of the day was a whopper, a block of one million shares crossed by Salomon Brothers at 10 1/2, fully one point lower than the opening sale.    Since the stock opened down 3/8, the block's price indicated somebody wanted out pretty badly -- a barometer, possibly, of prospects for the latest vehicle of former Esmark Chairman Donald Kelly. None of the company's major holders owned up to bailing out, and the stock closed down 1 at 10 7/8.    The name itself is supposed to suggest E-II could repeat the performance of Esmark Inc., whose stock multiplied eightfold under Mr. Kelly's reign in the five years before it was acquired by Beatrice Cos. in 1984.    Mr. Kelly is known as a wheeler-dealer who buys whole companies low and sells them high. At the moment, he presides over a grab bag of nine consumer products units including Samsonite luggage and Culligan water treatment systems, and six food companies such as Martha White flour and Lowrey's meat snacks.    E-II started life as a publicly traded company last summer with a $1 billion war chest. Most of that was raised from a sale of junk bonds when Beatrice spun out E-II July 2. At the time, Mr. Kelly said he might use the war chest to pay $5 billion or more for an acquisition this year. &quot;Nine billion dollars doesn't scare me,&quot; he said.    That was in May. So far, Mr. Kelly's only acquisition -- Zatarain's, a Cajun-Creole food maker -- has carried a somewhat less fearsome price tag: $35 million.    E-II's stock, issued at 15 a share, hit a high of 17 1/2 in early October, just before the slaughter in takeover-related stocks. Within a month, E-II hit a low of 7, bounced back to 10 and then slumped steadily back to below 8 by early December.    Then the stock began a remarkable surge touched off by disclosure that E-II held 4.6% of American Brands, the sort of multi-line consumer products company that might fit the Kelly profile. After the American Brands stake became known, Diana Temple of Salomon Brothers said that if E-II bought the whole company, that could boost E-II's estimated earnings for the year ending Feb. 28, 1989 to between $1.40 a share and $1.50 a share from $1.20 a share.    Keep in mind here that Salomon was E-II's lead underwriter, and Ms. Temple had the misfortune to recommend the stock Oct. 14 at a price over 16. Still, her theory on yesterday's decline is that the stock &quot;was just a little ahead of itself, and that prompted some profit-taking.&quot;    Ms. Temple believes E-II is similar to Revlon, an acquisition-minded company whose earnings prospects had little bearing on its stock price before it went private. She cautions investors: &quot;Do not let yourself be confused by the bottom line.&quot;    Instead, she points to cash flow, which she estimates will total $1 a share for the current fiscal year, and will top $2 a share the following year.    A money manager who doesn't own E-II stock says its share price also benefited from bullish remarks last week by PaineWebber analyst Roger Spencer. The PaineWebber analyst, who is based in E-II's home town of Chicago, reportedly visited with New York money managers. Mr. Spencer was traveling yesterday and couldn't be reached.    This money manager decided not to buy the stock after checking the story. Even though Congress didn't go through with many anti-merger proposals, he says the tax laws still limit use of so-called mirror subsidiaries to help corporations beat capital gains taxes on sales of units. He also says he is concerned about the burden of E-II's junk-bond payments.    &quot;The general attitude is that those types of moves that were done in the last five years that put acquisitions on everybody's lips aren't going to be there now,&quot; says food industry analyst Ron Morrow of Smith Barney, Harris Upham. &quot;It's going to take more time, study and effort to get quality acquisitions done.&quot;    As it is, some shareholders say Mr. Kelly has taken a hit of $70 million or more on his portfolio of stocks in 10 to 15 possible acquisition candidates. That same drop in market values, of course, presents Mr. Kelly with more bargains to buy. But it complicates the task of selling $3 billion of the assets of Beatrice, where he remains as chairman.    A spokesman for E-II said he couldn't comment on analysts' earnings estimates, the company's debt burden or how much its stock holdings tumbled during the crash. He said executives who could discuss such subjects weren't reachable. Is Mr. Kelly still contemplating $9 billion acquisitions? The spokesman replied, &quot;With Mr. Kelly, anything is possible.&quot;    ---   E-II Holdings   (NYSE; Symbol: EII)   Business: Consumer products and food    Year ended Feb. 28, 1987*:   Sales: $1.47 billion   Net income: $16.8 million   Second quarter, Aug. 31, 1987:    Loss: $35 million vs. $1.4 million    Average daily trading volume:   174,745 shares   Common shares outstanding: 61.8 million    *Pro-forma; company went public July 2, 1987 </TEXT></DOC>
