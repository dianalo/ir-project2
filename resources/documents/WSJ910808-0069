For some time, most doctors have been convinced thatlevels of total cholesterol above 200 milligrams perdeciliter of blood increase the risk of heart disease. Morerecent research has shown that a &quot;good&quot; form of cholesterol,high-density lipoproteins (HDL), can reduce that risk when itis between 40 and 60 milligrams.   Yet doctors often are baffled by how to interpret thetotal cholesterol and HDL readings together. &quot;We've thoughtthe ratio of total cholesterol to HDL is what matters most,&quot;says Charles Hennekens of Harvard University and Boston'sBrigham and Women's Hospital. &quot;But we needed proof of whatthat ratio is.&quot;   Dr. Hennekens and his colleagues searched for the perfectratio by comparing cholesterol and HDL levels of 246 men whohad heart attacks with a similar group of men without heartdisease. The subjects came from 15,000 doctors recruited inthe Physicians Health Study, which in 1988 found that dailyaspirin use could prevent heart attacks. When they enteredthe study in 1982, the physicians provided blood samples thatthe researchers stored.   In today's New England Journal of Medicine, theresearchers say doctors with a ratio of overall cholesterolto HDL cholesterol of three-to-one had the lowest risk of anattack. The risk rose 53% for each ratio number above three.Thus, someone with a cholesterol level above 200 isn't atrisk if the HDL is above 66.6. &quot;This offers very strongevidence of the protective value of HDL,&quot; Dr. Hennekens says,noting that HDL can be boosted by exercise and drinkingmodest amounts of alcohol.                                                                                                          Sniffing Heliotrope Helps   MRI Patients Sit Still                                                                                                          HOSPITALS may smell like flowers someday.   Researchers long have believed that aromas can affectmood. Odors that remind people of pleasant experiences, suchas the smell of apple pie baking, can help them relax, whilea sour stink makes people tense. In recent years, scientistsat fragrance companies have intensified the search for&quot;psychological smells&quot; to enhance perfumes and cosmetics, butproof that specific scents sway emotion is limited.   Now there are strong hints that heliotropin, a syntheticversion of the heliotrope flower's fragrance, is an effectivesedative.   Doctors at New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering CancerCenter have been seeking ways to calm worried patientsundergoing cancer-detection tests. Agitated patients who moveabout can distort images of internal organs produced inmagnetic-resonanceimaging machines.   Two staff psychologists, William Redd and Sharon Manne,looked into sedating scents, settling on heliotropin afterhaving hospital staffers sniff a bunch of smells. In a study,the psychologists compared stress levels of 40 patientsundergoing MRI who were exposed to the scent through a nasalrespirator with 45 others getting only fresh air.   In an unpublished report, the researchers say two-thirdsof the perfumed patients found the scent especially pleasantand reported much less anxiety than those who weren't exposedto it. The researchers say that they were &quot;surprised&quot; by howwell the fragrance relieved distress, but that furtherstudies are needed.                                                                                                          Search in Du Pont's Attic   Yields Alzheimer's Drug                                                                                                          SCIENTISTS discovered a new Alzheimer's drug by rummagingin Du Pont's attic of old chemicals.   Du Pont Merck Pharmaceutical Co., a year-old joint venturebetween the Wilmington, Del., chemical maker and Merck, theRahway, N.J., drug maker, is beginning a 750-patient test ofa medicine called linopirine. The drug spurs brain cells topump out extra acetylcholine, a chemical messenger thatcarries nerve impulses involved in memory. A hallmark ofAlzheimer's is a shortage of acetylcholine caused by thedeath of brain cells.   &quot;Our strategy was to stimulate what cells are still aliveto produce more acetylcholine than usual,&quot; says Robert Taber,vice president for research at Du Pont Merck, which had keptmum about the drug until recently.   Four years ago, Du Pont scientists began scanning thecompany's library of tens of thousands of unused chemicalsfor ones with a structure similar to several medicines usedin Europe that trigger a small discharge of acetylcholine.After screening only 100 chemicals, a brief hunt by suchstandards, the team found an especially potent stimulator ofacetylcholine.   Subsequent tinkering produced linopirine. In severalexperiments, the drug improved the ability of laboratory micewith artificially impaired memories to avoid electricalshocks. In one test, rodents given linopirine remembered theshocks more often than those given THA, a Warner-Lambert drugthat was unfavorably reviewed by regulators recently. Du PontMerck officials say a preliminary, 500-patient test oflinopirine was &quot;encouraging,&quot; but add that a new studycomparing it with a placebo is needed.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          AN ANALYSIS in the Journal of the American MedicalAssociation of several studies provides strong evidence thata daily tablet of aspirin can reduce a pregnant woman's riskof developing high blood pressure, which can be dangerous toher and the fetus. . . . A report in the Lancet in June foundthat a daily aspirin reduced the risk of giving birth tolow-weight babies among women who previously had such aproblem. Both studies emphasize that aspirin shouldn't beused without a doctor's supervision.</TEXT></DOC>
