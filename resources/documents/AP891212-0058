(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Tennessee Secretary of State GentryCrowell, whose office is at the center of a scandal over charitybingo, shot himself in the mouth today in a suicide attempt,authorities said.   Crowell, 57, was in stable condition at Vanderbilt UniversityMedical Center in Nashville, where he was taken for surgery toremove a bullet in his brain, authorities said.   ``Depression is a terrible thing. I didn't realize that Gentryhad anything bothering him to that extent,'' said House Speaker EdMurray.   Crowell said last month, when he appeared in Memphis before agrand jury investigating bingo corruption, that federalinvestigators had assured him they were not seeking an indictmentagainst him.   Capt. Mike Johnson of the Wilson County Emergency MedicalService said Crowell was found on his front porch by his son, a.38-caliber pistol nearby. Police said Crowell's son and wife werethe only other people at home.   The Internal Revenue Service, FBI and Tennessee Bureau ofInvestigation in 1986 began an investigation of alleged bribery andskimming of profits following reports that bingo operators werepaying state officials to ignore violations of laws regulating theindustry.   Twenty-two people have been indicted or pleaded guilty inTennessee this year as a result of the investigation.   All Tennessee bingo licenses were suspended March 9 after thestate Supreme Court ruled the games are illegal under the TennesseeConstitution.   Crowell has testified twice before federal grand juriesinvestigating alleged bingo corruption.   He has not been implicated in the scandal, but one formeremployee is serving a prison term in connection with theinvestigation and another was named as an unindicted co-conspirator.</TEXT></DOC>
