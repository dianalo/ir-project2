A survey by the San Jose Convention andamp;Visitors Bureau indicates 1.5 million people did just that to friends andfamily here last year -- and that count covers only the S.J. city limits. Nowyou know why you have to stand in line to use the bathroom. . . . Theconvention bureau, incidentally, will launch a campaign in June called&quot;Hometown Summer,&quot; designed to encourage San Joseans to show those visitorsthe hometown sights first before schlepping them all over the rest of thestate. Familiarity being what it is, New York residents don't visit the EmpireState Building and San Joseans don't visit the Winchester Mystery House, butmaybe a change in attitude is due. People who haven't been to the mysteryhouse (or the Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum or Alum Rock Park, for that matter)in the past 10 years will notice real changes. What happens with the EmpireState Building is up to those other guys. . . . As for the outmoded beliefthat there's nothing in San Jose worth a tourist's glance, check thisitinerary listing: &quot;4th day -- In the afternoon, say goodbye to wine countryand drive to San Jose to visit the Garage of the Technology Center of SiliconValley. Here you have a fascinating look at space age exhibits. Then, continuesouth to Monterey.&quot; That's from the current brochure of Chicago-based CaravanTours, one of the nation's largest bus-tour operations and just one of anumber of similar companies hauling tourists through the territory. Odd, isn'tit, that sometimes it takes people from someplace else to let us know whenwe're looking good.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  S.J. VISITORS SHOULD ALSO BE S.J. SIGHTSEERS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     EXPANSION JOINT -- Of course, sometimes out-of-towners don't get thepicture quite right. Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher comes to San JoseFriday for a seminar on exports and jobs, and a Commerce Dept. brochure forthe event lists among &quot;award winning exporters in San Jose&quot; -- the Port ofOakland. But hey, if the feds want to expand San Jose's influence let's have'em throw in San Francisco International, too. . . . If you've noticed a lotof purple on people this week it could be because 2,500 Elks Club members fromCalifornia and Hawaii are convening at the Santa Clara Convention Center.Highlight: a &quot;piggy bank march&quot; Saturday where Elks contribute to aid fordisabled kids, hoping to top last year's $2.8 million haul.;    THE OLD GANG-- There'll be an old bird among the sleek new craft at the San Jose JetCenter today and Friday -- a privately owned World War II B-24 &quot;Liberator&quot;bomber that's stopping by on a national tour. Among those sure to visit: LouAdes of San Jose's Lou's Do-Nut Shop, who captained a B-24 in wartime and thisweekend marks his 35th year in the doughnut biz with an anniversary party. AtLou's Village. . . . Classy move by National Semiconductor's Charlie Sporck,who'll be honored at an invite-only retirement party next Thursday at the SanJose Fairmont. Instead of gifts, Sporck asks that donations be made to theCrippled Children's Society. . . . And radio-TV greengrocer Joe Carcione maybe gone, but he won't be forgotten. Bellarmine College Prep on Sunday willdedicate its new Joe Carcione Student Activities Center, a building madepossible by a donation from Joe's widow, Madeline.;    FINALLEIGH -- Nothingsuperstitious about the Women's Fund. Its Women of Achievement dinner, the13th annual, is set for tonight at the S.J. Fairmont. So they added an extracategory for nominees -- science and technology -- to make the categoriestotal 13, too. Good luck.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Leigh Weimers column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910516  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  626  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday May 16, 199100137103,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
