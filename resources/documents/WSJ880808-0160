That's the chief reason the five leading oil ministers who met in Lausanne, Switzerland, last week were remarkably frank in talking about the cartel's escalating problems, but didn't appear to be in any hurry to address them.    Oil markets initially reacted negatively to what seemed an inconclusive outcome of the one-day meeting of OPEC's price-monitoring committee, as previously reported. But OPEC delegates confirmed in interviews that the possibility of an end to the Iraq-Iran war, which surfaced after the Lausanne meeting had been scheduled, meant a major reshaping of the cartel's strategy -- with most decisions on hold until a cease-fire is solidly in place.    &quot;Lausanne may yet prove to be the start of a catharsis that will help OPEC regain a grip on the oil market,&quot; reports OPEC Listener, an analysis service.    High oil production is OPEC's biggest problem. Petro-Logistics Ltd. of Geneva, which monitors OPEC output, reports production for July averaged 19.2 million barrels a day. OPEC's own estimate of third-quarter demand for its oil is only 17.6 million barrels a day.    Runaway production cannot be blamed entirely on the eight-year-old war between Iraq and Iran, although it has bitterly divided OPEC. But one of the chief problems is that Iraq remains outside OPEC's production quotas because of the war. The centerpiece of OPEC's new strategy, once the war ends, is to get Iraq back into the system.    &quot;I'm not saying it's going to be smooth sailing, but one of the obstacles will have been removed,&quot; says Rilwanu Lukman, Nigeria's oil minister and president of OPEC.    Not everyone is convinced, of course, that Iraq wants back in. Although its oil officials have said repeatedly that they would accept a quota equal to Iran's 2.4 million barrels a day, it has been producing as much as 2.8 million barrels a day. Many oil analysts suggest, in fact, that the war's end will trigger a new flood of petroleum onto glutted markets from both Iraq and Iran to finance rebuilding of their damaged economies.    But Mr. Lukman calls that &quot;a warped kind&quot; of view. He says Iraq and Iran will go for higher prices rather than larger volumes. &quot;If they are looking for more money,&quot; he says,&quot;the last thing they would do is flood the market and bring the price down.&quot;    Mr. Lukman and others also expect that several other issues dividing OPEC can be more easily resolved with settlement of the Iraq-Iran conflict. &quot;The possibility of authentic peace in the Middle East lessens the pressures within OPEC,&quot; says Arturo Hernandez Grisanti, Venezuela's oil minister who is to resign this week to run for re-election as a senator.    One such issue is production from the so-called Neutral Zone shared by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The two producers say the output of 400,000 barrels a day is mostly &quot;war relief&quot; crude for Iraq and shouldn't be included in their quotas. Since Iraq has no quota, Neutral Zone production escapes the system.    There are other issues -- including the definition of what constitutes &quot;crude oil&quot; under OPEC's quotas -- that are more political than technical. Those issues are largely a spillover from the Iraq-Iran war. To help resolve them, and to bring &quot;greater cohesion&quot; to the cartel -- the oil ministers have given their able new administrator, Subroto, a strong mandate to negotiate directly with all the OPEC nations.    Mr. Subroto, the former oil minister of Indonesia who became OPEC's secretary-general July 1, also will renew contacts with non-OPEC oil exporters regarding cooperation in curbing excess oil production. He is to leave today for Latin America to begin a world tour of oil exporters, both in and out of OPEC.    He also plans to travel soon to Baghdad and Tehran. For now, he says, &quot;the top priority is to bring Iraq into the fold again.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
