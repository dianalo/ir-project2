In announcing its 7th annual ``Badvertising Awards,'' the weeklytrade magazine denounced the presidential campaign for showingvoters ``some incompetent advertising.''   It cited the campaign of Democratic presidential candidateMichael Dukakis, in particular, for its so-called ``handlers''series. The television ads showed actors portraying cynical Bushhandlers trying to disguise their candidate's alleged shortcomings.

The magazine said the results of its survey were based oncomments from its editorial staffers and readers.   ``Every year we all see hundreds of ads that are forgettably bad.A few ads, though, manage to be memorably bad,'' the trade magazinesaid in its Jan. 16 issue.   Among the other recipients of Adweek's Badvertising Award:   _Scotch Tape for its ``mean-spirited spot demonstrating theproduct's effectiveness by dunking a woman repeatedly into a tank ofwater.''   _Eveready Batteries for ``its insensitivey to contemporayrealities.'' The spot in question featured a gun-toting toddler withthe appellation, ``Holy Terror,'' which Adweek claimed was tooeasily translated to ``terrorist.''   _Jordache Basics for ``featuring whining teens making noparticular point in their 30-second spot.''   _Mercedes S.
