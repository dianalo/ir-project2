Wedtech, a Bronx-based defense contractor, filed for bankruptcy-law protection last December, only four months after it issued a $75 million high-risk, high-yield bond issue to pay off its mounting bank debt. Last February four former company officials pleaded guilty to inflating the company's profits and paying bribes to public officials to retain a minority-firm status to gain no-bid contracts.    The suit charges KMG Main Hurdman, Wedtech's auditor from 1982 until April 1985, with failing to disclose $4.7 million in contract payments Wedtech illegally obtained from the federal government. It also charges KMG Main Hurdman with rendering a clean opinion on Wedtech's financial statements despite knowing about fraud, corporate waste and inaccurate financial reporting of the previous management.    Damages sought against KMG Main Hurdman by the suit are $20 million in compensatory and $50 million in punitive amounts. Earlier this month the firm was merged into Peat Marwick.    Richard I. Miller, associate general counsel for Peat and former KMG Main Hurdman general counsel, said the accounting firm is also a &quot;victim of the fraud and is being sued by the perpetrators.&quot; He said he is &quot;surprised&quot; by the suit because the $4.7 million in illegal payments was &quot;disclosed to Wedtech management, its board and outside counsel&quot; by KMG Main Hurdman.    The suit also alleges that Touche Ross, Wedtech's auditor from mid-1985 until the end of 1986, issued unqualified opinions for Wedtech's public offerings that &quot;grossly overstated&quot; the company's financial condition. It charges that Touche Ross certified financial statements showing that Wedtech was healthy when the company was actually insolvent.    Damages sought against Touche Ross total $10 million in compensatory and $25 million in punitive amounts.    Richard H. Murray, Touche's general counsel, said the accounting firm &quot;was instrumental in recognizing and bringing to public attention Wedtech's deteriorating condition in late 1986.&quot; He added: &quot;Now the same company who so effectively wore the cloak of deceit purports to don the mantle of respectability by blaming its abuses on others.&quot;    Wedtech officials have admitted to law enforcement officials that the company illegally obtained the status of a minority-run company to obtain no-bid contracts through bribes of public officials. Wedtech lost such special status in early 1986 and much of its government orders later last year. </TEXT></DOC>
