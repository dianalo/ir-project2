The display of 225 pieces of Chinese art and artifacts dating tothe 4th century B.C. runs through Sept. 4.   Some say the fanfare surrounding the show could generate supportfor other, large-scale art exhibitions.   ``This city is entering into a larger arena for the arts,'' saidMerribell Parsons, the exhibit's director and head of the ColumbusMuseum of Art.   The show features objects from the palaces of 2,600 years ofChinese emperors and kings. They were lent mostly by museums inBeijing and eight Chinese provinces.   Included are life-sized terra-cotta horses and warrior sculpturesfrom the tomb of China's first emperor; 2,500-year-old cookingvessels and temple bells; delicate scroll paintings from the 15thcentury; and a 2nd-century jade burial suit.   Some of the items were found in recent archeological digs inChina, Ms. Parsons said.   ``Son of Heaven'' was China's term for its emperors, believed tobe the human link to Heaven.   ``It's a very, very important record of Chinese cultural historyand its art,'' Washington University art professor Robert Thorp saidrecently. Thorp helped lead the collaboration of the Chinesegovernment and a U.S. organizing committee that created the exhibit.   The importance of ``Son of Heaven'' hasn't been lost on Columbus.   More than a week before the opening, about 85,000 tickets hadbeen sold at $4.50 to $12.50, said exhibit spokeswoman Pat Cramer.   Columbus schoolchildren were learning ancient Chinese history toprepare for field trips, and Ohio State University added a series of``Son of Heaven'' lectures to its continuing education curriculum.   A downtown department store since last fall has devoted a sectionof its first floor to ``Son of Heaven'' sweatshirts, T-shirts andmugs.   An empty downtown school was loaned by the city and converted forthe show into a five-gallery, 40,000-square-foot exhibition hall. Iteven contains a cafeteria for visitors and a hospitality suite fordonors.   Not that the arts generally go ignored in Columbus, a city ofslightly more than half a million that supports a professionalorchestra, ballet company, opera company and theater troupe.   But this exhibition has been compared to the ``Treasures ofTutankhamun,'' the ancient Egyptian collection that drew millions ofvistors during a U.S. tour that included Chicago more than a decadeago.   The success of ``Tut'' may have helped generate support forlater, major exhibits in Chicago, including a display of Pompeiianart at the Art Institute and another Egyptian show that opened atthe Field Museum of Chicago last November, said that museum'sEgyptian consultant, Frank Yurco.   The Field Museum sold 47,000 new memberships during ``Tut's''four-month stay there in 1977, said spokewoman Barbara Scott.   Organizers in Columbus hope to capitalize on a similar wave ofpublic interest to draw at least 500,000 visitors to ``Son ofHeaven.'' Proceeds must meet an estimated $6.35 million in expenses,they say.   About 500,000 people saw ``Son of Heaven'' last year in Seattle _the show's only other stop in the United States.   As for future projects in Columbus, who knows?   The Columbus Museum of Art is toying with the idea of trying toraise $60 million to $80 million for an expansion by the year 2000.   ``It's possible,'' Ms. Parsons said. ``After this (exhibit), Ireally think it's possible.''</TEXT></DOC>
