Although the structure and sequenceof the corresponding gene show nonhomology with the IFN-{beta} gene,the gene is identical to that of B-cell stimulatory factor 2, a humaninterleukin, and displays a very potent growth and differentiation factoractivity for B lymphocytes. In this work the authors show that IL-1{beta}and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) strongly induce the 26-kDa protein inFS-4 fibroblasts and in some transformed cell lines. Addition of cycloheximideto recombinant (r)IL-1{beta} and rTNF further enhances the level of 26-kDa-proteinmRNA. They determined the kinetics of induction and the amounts of rTNFand rIL-1{beta} required for optimal induction of this mRNA in FS-4 cellsand in HeLa H21 cells and found that rIL-1{beta} is more efficient inducerof 26-kDa protein mRNA than is TNF. By analyzing the inducibility ofthe 26-kDa protein gene by rTNF and rIL-1{beta} in a series of transformedcell lines that differ in their sensitivity to the cytotoxic action ofTNF, they report a direct correlation between the 26-kDa protein mRNAexpression and the resistance of these cells to the cytotoxic effectof TNF.</TEXT></DOC>
