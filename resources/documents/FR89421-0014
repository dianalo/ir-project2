On July 18, 1988, the Commission released a <T3>Notice of Proposed Rulemaking </T3>(MTS and WATS Market Structure,Link-Up America, and Amendment of Part 36 of the Commission's Rules), whichproposed revising the eligibility requirements for the Link-Up Americaprogram, a federal assistance program designed to encourage low-incomehouseholds, that are not on the telephone network, to subscribe to localexchange service by reducing initial service and installation charges.2. The Federal-State Joint Board, and parties commenting on the Noticehave indicated substantial support for eliminating the non-income eligibilitycriteria for those applicants who have met the requirements of a State-establishedincome test. These eligibility rules were found to foreclose Link-Up serviceto over 15 percent of all applicants, and as the commentors demonstrate,the restrictions have prevented otherwise eligible persons from receivingthe benefits of this telephone connection program. The Commission agreesthat when income eligibility is verified, the non-income eligibility requirementsof the Link-Up program may be eliminated. The Commission agreed with theJoint Board that it is costly and often infeasible for states and telephonecompanies to maintain the records necessary to verify the non-income criteria.The Commission found that the income eligibility criteria alone shouldbe sufficient to ensure proper targeting of the program.3. In order to be eligible for assistance when income eligibility is verified,a residential subscriber must (1) meet the requirements of a State-establishedincome test, and (2) not be a dependent, unless the subscriber is 60 yearsof age or older. Alternatively, when income is not verified, a residentialsubscriber may self-certify andplusmin;1 and andplusmin;2, and the entity receivingcertification (state or company) must verify that the customer (3) haslived at an address where there has been no telephone service for at leastthree months, and (4) has not received assistance within the last two years.<ITAG tagnum="84">Ordering Clauses </ITAG>1.
