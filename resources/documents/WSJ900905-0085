For composers trying to getpaid when their music is heard on cable television,irritation has escalated into a war with some of cable'sbiggest powers.   If the composers win, cable companies will have to paymillions more for the music used in their programs. Thoseincreases could well be passed on in subscriber charges,leaving consumers singing the blues as well.</LP><TEXT>   The battle is tangled and extensive, with at least half adozen suits and countersuits already filed between the groupsthat collect fees for composers and various cable companies.A judge is scheduled today to issue a ruling in one of thecases that could hamper cable powerhouse HBO's ability tooperate.   The critical issue isn't just how much the societies wantto charge cable for music rights -- a lot more -- but whomthey charge. Observing that the biggest share of money incable flows from subscribers to local cable franchises, thecomposer groups want to charge performance fees to localoperators in addition to the cable channels. The cableindustry is fighting that plan on every possible front.   Now, the average guy watching a movie in his living roommay only notice the sound track in passing. But someone hasto make sure that John Williams gets paid when &quot;Indiana Jonesand the Last Crusade&quot; is shown on HBO. In that case, thesomeone is Broadcast Music Inc., known as BMI, whichrepresents some 100,000 composers and publishers, from theestate of Charles Ives to Michael Jackson. The other majorperforming-rights society, Ascap, the American Society ofComposers, Authors and Publishers, monitors performances forits 45,000 members.   Both BMI and Ascap have been collecting money for yearsfrom bars, skating rinks, and radio and television networks,with each new field they enter sparking a major battle. Thesedays the two are even going after shopping malls andconvention planners for music fees, but cable television is amuch vaster new territory. &quot;Composers can't collect thesefees themselves, and it's our responsibility to protect themas new technologies arise,&quot; says Frances Preston, BMI'spresident.   Although cable giant Home Box Office Inc., a unit of TimeWarner Inc., has paid for music rights for more than adecade, many cable channels don't have licenses.   Those that do pay relatively modest rates that reflectcable's fledgling status when BMI and Ascap started chargingthe industry a decade ago.   &quot;Cable has mushroomed into a giant industry, but it seemslike the cable people are saying: `We paid you a pittancebefore, and that's all we want to pay,'&quot; says RichardSherman, a Los Angeles composer whose movie scores include&quot;Mary Poppins&quot; and &quot;The Jungle Book.&quot; &quot;I think it's bloodyridiculous. The upfront money for most composers is modest:Performance fees are our lifeblood.&quot;   Currently, an average HBO subscriber pays between $100 and$125 a year to watch the channel: From that, HBO's feeamounts to about 27 cents per subscriber to BMI and Ascapcombined to cover a year's worth of music performances.   Still, HBO contends that if BMI gets the rate increase itwants, the group's revenue from cable will leap to $130million a year from about $10 million now. That would be wellabove the $75 million to $100 million BMI takes in from allTV broadcasters, both the networks and local stations. BMIcalls HBO's estimates &quot;distorted&quot; and says they are based onfigures meant to be a starting point for negotiation.   At the moment, the lawsuit generating the most fireworksis one between BMI and HBO. This will probably be the testcase for whether BMI and Ascap can legally charge local cableoperators separately, in so-called split licenses.   BMI sued HBO in December in U.S. District Court in NewYork as HBO's license was about to expire and the two partiescouldn't agree on a higher fee. One reason HBO refused tosign is that it disputes the legality of split licenses,which were demanded by BMI. Under a split license, HBO wouldbe buying performance rights for the programs only until theyare transmitted to the local operator, not all the waythrough to the home viewer -- which HBO says would put it ata competitive disadvantage to cable channels without splitlicenses.   Wanting to use the case to prove it is legal to chargeoperators separately, BMI pulled Manhattan Cable TelevisionInc., a local operator and a unit of Time Warner, HBO'sparent, into the same suit as a defendant several monthslater.   To bring the issue to a head faster, BMI asked for aninjunction to prevent HBO from airing any programs containingmusic by BMI composers: Since its license expired, HBO hascontinued to run such programs without paying fees. Theruling expected today is on the injunction.   If Judge John Sprizzo grants BMI an immediate injunction,its effect on HBO will be drastic. John Redpath Jr., generalcounsel for HBO, says that at least half of HBO's Septemberschedule, about 80 movies, contains music by BMI composers. Aban would affect movies from &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; to&quot;Batman,&quot; says Mr. Redpath, and make it more or lessimpossible for HBO to operate. He says HBO would appeal aninjunction.   Eventually, perhaps even today, Judge Sprizzo will have toaddress the underlying issue of the split license.   HBO and Manhattan Cable maintain that BMI's demand forseparate licenses for cable channels and local operatorsviolates antitrust laws. The reason: the logistics involveddictate only one type of license for local operators, makingit a monopolistic practice. Anybody who gets a license fromBMI or Ascap can choose to get a so-called blanket license, aflat fee covering all BMI composers; or they cantheoretically negotiate separate licenses for differentprograms, composers or songs, in some cases directly withproducers.   But for a cable operator, which simultaneously carries 30or 50 different channels, &quot;it is impossible to negotiatelicenses for each program on each channel separately,&quot; saysMr. Redpath, the HBO attorney. Manhattan Cable, for one, saysit airs about 480 programs in a day. &quot;Split licensing,because it forces an operator to take a blanket license, isillegal,&quot; says Mr. Redpath.   The contention that split licenses violate antitrust lawshas been backed up by 27 state attorneys general, who filed a&quot;friend of the court brief&quot; in June.   BMI lawyers say HBO and Manhattan Cable haven't proved incourt hearings that operators can't negotiate individuallicenses. &quot;The copyright law says that whoever engages in apublic performance of music is supposed to pay for it,&quot; saysRobert Sisk, an attorney representing BMI. &quot;Other court caseshave established that the transmission of a program to theviewer from local cable operators is a separate performance.Therefore, the operator has a responsibility to get alicense.&quot;   Furthermore, &quot;BMI believes the blanket license is the mostefficient, least costly method of obtaining performancerights,&quot; Mr Sisk says. &quot;This fight is over the fact that HBOdoesn't want to pay a little more for it.&quot;   Ascap is also fighting to make cable operators payseparately. But rather than sue them, Ascap is going througha procedure set up in the '50s under a consent decree. AllAscap rate disputes are settled by a judge in New York'sSouthern District, who heard the arguments on the splitlicense more than a year ago but hasn't ruled yet. That judgecould well be influenced by Judge Sprizzo's decision. (Onegoal of the cable industry is a similar arena for ratedisputes for BMI.)   The cable industry filed a lawsuit in federal districtcourt in Washington in which two associations of cableoperators, the National Cable Television Association and theCommunity Antenna Television Association, joined with theDisney Channel and Black Entertainment Television to sue BMI.The suit charges BMI with &quot;unlawful price-fixing activities.&quot;Hearings are scheduled for January.   If both sides dig in their heels, the lawsuits betweenBMI, Ascap and the cable industry may rage on for years. Asuit filed by CBS against both societies in 1969 dragged onfor over a decade; Ultimately, the Supreme Court said blanketlicenses can be legal in some circumstances.   David Grossberg, an attorney who represents composers,believes BMI and HBO are likely to reach a settlement. Headds, &quot;I'd also predict that, no matter what happens, thecable industry will pay more than they're paying now.&quot;   ---          Music Makers Go for More of Cable's Money                                                                                                                            The Cable Industry                                                                                                          Estimates for 1990 Revenue                                                                                                          -- Cable programming networks (advertising plus fees fromoperators): $2.8 billion   -- Local operators (subscriber fees plus localadvertising): $17.8 billion                                                                                                                                    vs.                                                                                                                                   Ascap                                                                                                          -- Organized in 1914 by composers   -- Represents about three million songs by 45,000composers and publishers   -- Annual revenue from licensing fees: about $250 million                                                                                                                                    BMI                                                                                                          -- Formed in 1940 by radio broadcasters as Ascapalternative   -- Represents about 1.5 million songs by 100,000 composersand publishers   -- Annual revenue from licensing fees: about $200 million                                                                                                          Source: Paul Kagan Associates Inc., BMI and Ascap</TEXT></DOC>
