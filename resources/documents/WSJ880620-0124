After five months of wrangling, Nova has agreed to buy Polysar Energy andamp; Chemical Corp. of Toronto for about $1.6 billion. With partners, Nova is mulling a $1.6 billion expansion of its Alberta petrochemical complex and trying to revive interest in a $22.5 billion natural gas pipeline from Alaska.    Meanwhile, Nova's oil-producing affiliate, Husky Oil Ltd., is considering a $1 billion heavy oil upgrading project in western Canada. Husky is also mulling a merger with Texaco Canada Inc., one of Canada's biggest oil companies.    For Mr. Blair, the politically astute, 58-year-old chairman of Nova and co-chairman of Husky, all the action is a welcome return to his management style of the 1970s. That's when Mr. Blair took a sleepy, regulated gas conduit called Alberta Gas Trunk Line Co. and turned it into Nova, a major Canadian industrial force, using high-risk petrochemical and oil and gas investments.    Then came recession and a collapse of petrochemical and energy markets that placed Mr. Blair's growth plans on hold. By 1986, problems were so severe that Mr. Blair and other senior corporate officers took a temporary, 15% pay cut. Now a recovery is under way because of recent, sharp price increases for petrochemicals, but Nova's per-share earnings and stock price are still below their 1980 peaks. Mr. Blair was unavailable to be interviewed for this article.    &quot;I'm sure he's got a little pain that he's been carrying for a long time as a result of the way investors have been disillusioned, but his decisions of 12 years ago are paying off now,&quot; says Samuel Kane, a Toronto-based chemical analyst with the securities firm McLeod Young Weir Ltd.    With the acquisition of Polysar, Nova will be tied with Shell Oil Co. as North America's largest producer of ethylene, says Mr. Kane. He adds that ethylene, used to make polyethylene plastics and other products, is currently in short supply and of growing value. &quot;It's the black gold of the 1980s,&quot; he says. Mr. Kane says the proposed acquisition is &quot;terrific&quot; for Nova. &quot;It allows a Canadian chemical company to compete with the globe,&quot; he says.    James Doak, an analyst with First Marathon Securities Ltd., Toronto, adds that Mr. Blair &quot;is a long term investor. . . . He is a strategic company builder in the Japanese sense. He keeps his eye on politics and he turns local advantages into global advantages.&quot;    One local advantage working for Mr. Blair is a close relationship with Alberta Premier Donald Getty, a former Nova director who provoked controversy by accepting a free flight on a Nova aircraft last spring. Along with the Canadian government and the province of Saskatchewan, Mr. Getty's government recently offered Husky more than $500 million of low-interest loans as an incentive to build the western Canadian heavy oil upgrading project.    Another local advantage that Mr. Blair has exploited is Alberta's abundance of ethane, a hydrocarbon found with natural gas that is used to make ethylene. As the only manufacturer of ethylene in Alberta, Nova has a government-sanctioned right to buy ethane at regulated prices, even though some natural gas producers are fighting for the right to sell the hydrocarbon at market prices. Nova says it will proceed with the $1.6 billion of petrochemical investments only if Mr. Getty's government extends the current arrangement to the proposed facility. A decision is expected soon.    Mr. Blair has been particularly astute at sidestepping federal restrictions on certain business activities. In the case of the Polysar takeover, Mr. Blair avoided a restriction that prevents anyone from owning more than 25% of the stock of the former government-owned company. Instead, he agreed to acquire all of Polysar's assets and liabilities, leaving the company essentially a shell. The proceeds are to be paid as a dividend to Polysar shareholders.    Mr. Blair was similarly skillful in bringing in Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing and his family as partners for Husky last year, despite a Canadian prohibition against foreigners acquiring control of Canadian-owned oil and gas assets. Now, Husky has the financial muscle to make acquisitions of its own, including a proposed C$400 million takeover of Canterra Energy Ltd. and a possible business combination with Texaco Canada.    Because of the Canadian law, Mr. Blair arranged for the Hong Kong businessman's companies to obtain only 43% of Husky's stock, the same level as Nova's stake. The remainder of Husky is held by Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, in which Mr. Li has a small minority interest, and by Mr. Li's 25-year-old son Victor, a Canadian citizen. &quot;It was a perfectly created balance,&quot; says federal government lawyer Hedy Kirkby, who helps administer the takeover rules. &quot;It was very innovative.&quot;    With the current boom in petrochemicals, Mr. Blair appears confident that Nova's bad years are over. At the Nova annual meeting in April he predicted that net income should double this year, creating a new record for per-share earnings. He even invited shareholders to &quot;hang&quot; him and his two most senior officers if Nova's earnings and business don't grow &quot;distinctly faster than our competitors' during the next few years.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
