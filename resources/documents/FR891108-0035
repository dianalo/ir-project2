Pursuant to 5U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Servicehas certified that this action will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities. The amendment(s) would reducethe regulatory burden of handlers while minimizing the economic impacton producers.Prior document in this proceeding:<T3>Notice of Hearing:</T3> Issued August 10, 1989; published August 16,1989 (54 FR 33709).<ITAG tagnum="84">Preliminary Statement</ITAG>Notice is hereby given of the filing with the Hearing Clerk of this recommendeddecision with respect to proposed amendments to the tentative marketingagreements and to the orders regulating the handling of milk in the MiddleAtlantic and Certain Other Marketing Areas. This notice is issued pursuantto the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937,as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), and the applicable rules of practice andprocedure governing the formulation of marketing agreements and marketingorders (7 CFR part 900).Interested parties may file written exceptions to this decision with theHearing Clerk, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC, 20250, bythe 15th day after publication of this decision in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> Four copies of the exceptions should be filed.All written submissions made pursuant to this notice will be made availablefor public inspection at the office of the Hearing Clerk during regularbusiness hours (7 CFR 1.27(b)).This proceeding reopened the hearings previously held on proposed amendmentsto the New England, New York-New Jersey, and Middle Atlantic orders. Similarly,an earlier hearing on a proposed new order for the Carolina marketing areaalso was reopened in this proceeding. This Recommended Decision does notinclude specific findings for those orders. Findings pertaining to ClassII prices, if appropriate, will be made in the Recommended Decisions tobe issued for those orders.The proposed amendments set forth below are based on the record of a publichearing held at Alexandria, Virginia, on August 22, 1989, pursuant to anotice of hearing issued August 16, 1989 (54 FR 33709).The material issue on the record of the hearing relates to:1. Changing the manner in which the Class II milk price is determined andannounced in most Federal milk orders.<ITAG tagnum="84">Findings and Conclusions  </ITAG>The following findings and conclusions on the material issue are basedon evidence presented at the hearing and the record thereof:  The orders involved in this proceeding that now provide for tentative andfinal Class II price announcements should be amended to provide that theClass II price will be announced on or before the the 15th day of the preceedingmonth. Once announced, the Class II price would not be revised. Nevertheless,the objective of the current pricing arrangement, whereby the Class IIprice would not be less than the Class III price for the month, shouldbe maintained in principle. Therefore, to the extent that the announcedClass II price without adjustment for any prior month is less than theClass III price (or the basic formula price in some orders such as thetwo-class Florida orders) for the month, such difference would be includedin computing subsequent months' Class II price.  For example, the Class II price for January would be announced on December15th. On February 5, the January Class III price would be announced. Ifthe January Class II price was less than the Class III price for January,that difference would be included in computing the Class III price forMarch, which would be announced on February 15. Thus, handlers would payessentially a Class II price that would be floored by the Class III price.However, if the Class II price is less than the Class III price (or thebasic formula price in some orders), the adjustment to reflect this differencewould not be returned to producers until they receive payment for milkproduced in the second succeeding month. This provision, as adopted therein,reflects the proposal by the Milk Industry Foundation (MIF) and the InternationalIce Cream Association (IICA), with a modification proposed by the NationalMilk Producers Federation (NMPF), and by Agri-Mark Inc., Eastern Milk ProducersCooperative Association Inc., and Dairylea Cooperative, Inc. (Agri-Mark,et al.), which are dairy farmer cooperatives.  MIF is a national trade association representing 1,000 dairy processingplants nationwide and accounts for about 80 percent of the fluid milk andrelated products produced in the United States. IICA is a trade associationthat represents 210 member companies who distribute about 85 percent ofthe ice cream and related frozen desserts consumed in the United States.The NMPF is an organization representing most of the dairy farmer cooperativesin the United States.  Handlers who utilize milk in Class II uses, such as cottage cheese, icecream and yogurt, want to know in advance what the cost of the raw milkwill be. It was for this purpose that the orders were amended in 1981 toprovide for determination and announcement of a tentative Class II priceon the 15th day of the preceding month. However, if the Class III price,which is announced some 50 days later on the fifth day of the followingmonth, is higher than the tentative Class II price, then the Class IIIprice also becomes the final Class II price. In such cases, the final ClassII price is not known until after the month is over. From October 1981through June 1989 (93 months), there have been 22 months when the finalClass II price was increased after the month was over due to this featureof the current order provisions. One of the exhibits introduced at thehearing indicates that the increased value of Class II milk due to changesfrom the tentative Class II prices to the final Class II prices from March1984 amounted to more than 23.5 million dollars. It is this retroactiveprice adjustment aspect of the current Class III pricing provisions thathandlers proposed to change through this proceeding.  The increases from the tentative Class II prices to the final Class IIprices on the 22 occasions noted above have varied from two cents per hundredweightto 74 cents per hundredweight. The reason handlers find these changes tobe a burden is because by the time they know how much the increase is,they have already received the milk, made the products, and perhaps pricedand sold most of the products to their customers. These factors were citedby all witnesses supporting the MIF/IICA proposal for final forward pricing.Obviously, handlers would much prefer to know the raw product cost beforethey establish selling prices for the products they make from the milk.The record indicates that handlers believe that they cannot do an effectivejob of determining product prices to their customers under the currentClass II pricing provisions. Moreover, they are unable to recover after-the-factincreases in the prices for Class II milk.  Under the MIF/IICA proposal, when the Class III price for the month ishigher than the Class II price announced on the 15th of the preceding month,the difference would be added in future months in increments not to exceed25 cents per hundredweight for each prior month. This proposed ``catch-up''feature is intended to not cause a reduction in producer returns, whileat the same time avoiding large month-to-month price increases at timeswhen milk prices are rapidly increasing. The witness testifying on behalfof the MIF/IICA said that it would be desirable to avoid large increasesin the Class II prices from month to month. This view was also supportedin testimony by witnesses representing the Borden Company, MorningStarFoods, Inc., Marigold Foods, Inc., the Kroger Co., and Dean Foods, Co. On the other hand, NMPF and Agri-Mark, et al., separately proposed a modificationof the ``catch-up'' so that the entire difference between the announcedClass II price and the Class III price for the month would be includedin computing the Class II price at the next opportunity. This modificationwas intended to minimize any impact upon producer returns that might resultfrom elimination of the final Class II price announcement. With this change,there would be minimal delay in returning to producers the full value oftheir milk at the prescribed Class II price level. Both the NMPF and Agri-Mark,et al, supported adoption of the MIF/IICA proposal if it was modified asthey suggested.  An alternative mechanism for determining the Class II price was proposedby the Milk Foundation of Indiana (MFI). As proposed, the Class II priceeach month would be the Minnesota-Wisconsin (M-W) price for the secondpreceding month plus the appropriate differential, such as 10 cents, plusor minus the average difference between the M-W price for the second precedingmonth and the current month in each of the preceding three years. Accordingto the proponent's spokesman, this method of determining the Class II pricewould result in less price volatility over time, and would reduce the seasonaldistortion of advance pricing. Under this proposal there would be no ``catch-up''adjustments.  The proponent's witness supported elimination of retroactive Class II pricingbut expressed his view that the MFI proposal respresented an effort toretain the current targeted level of price differential, place all classprices on the same base, lessen the contra-seasonal aspect of advance pricing,and to provide meaningful advance notice of the Class II price. He statedthat the proposal would result in a class price that lags below the M-Wprice if the M-W price increases more sharply in the current year thanit increased in three previous years. He also noted that the resultingprice would stay above the M-W price in years where the rate of changeis approximately the same or less than in previous years and that the reversewould be true in those months when the M-W price moves are downward. Heexplained that over the long run this method would yield a return to producersfor Class II milk that would average 10 cents over the Class III price.MFI filed a brief in support of its proposed advanced pricing method. Inits brief, MFI urged that any method of computing the Class II price thatresults from this proceeding should focus on advance notice of a finalprice and not violate the premise of classified pricing.The brief further states that there is nothing in the factors that theSecretary must consider in fixing a price for each classification thatallows an increase in a price in a month ``* * * just because the producerswould have received a higher return had their milk gone into a differentclass use in the previous month than it actual[ly] did.'' Accordingly,the brief urges the Secretary to adopt proposal No. 2 rather than proposalNo. 1 because proposal No. 2 would adhere to those principles and wouldprovide more stable prices than any of the other proposals.Another alternative approach was suggested by a witness who testified onbehalf of Prairie Farms Dairy, Inc. (PED). While indicating support forelimination of retroactive pricing for Class II milk, he proposed a modifiedapproach that would combine certain aspects of proposal Nos. 1 and 2. Underhis proposed modification, the Class II price would be determined usinga portion of proposal No. 2, and the adjustment feature of proposal No.1 would be used to adjust the Class II price in subsequent months if theClass III price for the current month exceeded the Class II price. He statedthat this modified approach would have several advantages over either proposalNo. 1 or proposal No. 2. In his view, such a provision would eliminateretroactive Class II pricing, be simple and easy to understand, permitannouncing all class prices on a single date each month, and have little,if any, effect on returns to producers.Under PFD's proposed modification, the Class II price each month wouldbe the M-W price for the second preceding month plus 10 cents. If suchprice was less than the Class III price for the second preceding month,the difference in increments of 25 cents would be added to the Class IIprice in subsequent months until the difference was made up. PFD's representativealso testified that perhaps the Class II price should be the Class IIIprice plus as much as 50 cents. Central Milk Producers Cooperative (CMPC), a federation of 14 cooperatives,whose members collectively price milk to fluid milk buyers regulated underthe Chicago Regional milk order, submitted a brief in support of proposals1 and 2 as proposed to be modified by PFD.In particular, the CMPC brief indicates support for pricing Class II milkat the M-W price for the second preceding month plus 50 cents, plus a singlecatch-up adjustment if the announced Class II price was less than the ClassIII price for the month. The brief cites some of the same advantages asnoted by the PFD spokesman.The proposal submitted by the MIF/IICA, with the modification proposedby NMPF and Agri-Mark, et al., offers a reasonable approach to deal withthe retroactive pricing problem in the current Class II pricing provisions.First, it does not change the basic method of determining the Class IIprice level. When the tentative Class II price provisions were adopted,the decision to do so clearly indicated an objective of the proponentsto maintain a Class II price level at ten cents above the Class III price.An analysis of the prices that would have been in effect had the provisionsadopted herein been in effect from 1983 through 1988 indicates almost nodifference, on an annual basis, from the prices obtained under the currentprovisions, ranging from a minus five cents per hundredweight in 1988 tono difference in 1983. Due to the ``catch-up'' feature of the new procedure,there is greater variation when prices under the proposed and current provisionsare compared on a monthly basis. However, the basic Class II price levelessentially will be maintained while at the same time the problems of retroactivepricing now faced by handlers will be alleviated.Elimination of the retroactive pricing aspect of the current Class II pricingprovisions was recognized as a desirable goal by all participants at thehearing, although one dairy farmer cooperative did oppose the two particularproposals that are under consideration in this proceeding. The NationalFarmers Organization (NFO), a multi-commodity collective bargaining organizationfor farmers that operates bargaining and marketing programs for dairy farmerspooled in approximately 21 Federal milk orders, opposed both the MIF/IICand the MFI proposals. NFO preferred that no changes be made in the currentmethod of Class II milk pricing. An NFO representative expressed the viewthat the MIF/IICA proposal created extreme fluctuations in the Class IIprice. He also maintained that the MFI proposed price, by rolling forwardfor three years the price declines over the last several years, resultsin a price for Class II milk that was unacceptably low. Simply stated,NFO opposed both proposals on the basis that neither one would yield anacceptable Class II price.Each of the proposals and proposed modifications of the proposals was analyzed.The current Class II pricing provisions of the orders were intended toyield a Class II price that, over time, would approximate the M-W priceplus 10 cents, or in some orders, plus 15 cents or 25 cents. It was withthis goal in mind that the proposals under consideration in this proceedingwere evaluated. The pricing procedure proposed by the MIF-IICA, as proposedto be modified by the NMPF, comes the closest over the period from January1983 through July 1989, to having provided the same prices as those thatwere final Class II prices. Moreover, it is clear that this approach haswidespread support within the industry. Certain handler representativesin fact indicated that they had no objection to the modification proposedby the NMPF, even though its application could result in some larger month-to-monthprice increases than otherwise would have resulted from the MIF-IICA'sunmodified proposal.With the exception of NFO, no other representatives expressed oppositionto this approach. Even NFO's should be somewhat addressed in that producerswill receive the full value for their Class II milk with less delay underthe provision adopted herein than under any of the other proposals.Some of the testimony indicated that it is desirable to minimize the sizeof the month-to-month changes in the prices for Class II milk. From a handler'sstandpoint, this probably is true. Nevertheless, we see no basis in thisrecord for favoring one proposed method of establishing prices over anotherjust because one has less price variations than another. More particularly,there is no basis here to conclude that there should be more concern inthis regard for changes in the Class II price than there is with regardto changes in the Class I and/or Class III prices. Those prices changeby whatever amount the Minnesota-Wisconsin price changes from month tomonth.Under the provisions adopted herein, if the announced Class II price fora month (before adjustments) is less than the Class III price for thatmonth, the difference (in all but one possible case) would be includedin computing the Class II price for the second succeeding month. This reflectsa long-standing Class II pricing intent that the value for Class II milkshould not be less than the value for Class III milk. The one possibleexception would be where the announced Class II price had been lower thanthe Class III price for the first month that an order to incorporate theseproposed amendments would be in effect. In that case, the ``catch-up''feature of the provisions adopted herein would not become effective untilthe second month after its implementation.The Pacific Northwest order provides that the Class III price will be theM-W price, or a butter-powder formula price, whichever is lower. Accordingly,a companion provision provides that if the butter-powder formula priceis the Class III price, then the final Class II price shall be reducedby the amount that the Class III price is less than the basic formula priceto the extent that the Class II price would not be less than the ClassIII price. The order language adopted herein will preserve that price relationshipbetween the Class II and Class III prices.In one of the briefs filed, a question was raised over whether the factorsthat must be considered by the Secretary in fixing minimum class pricesunder an order included pricing to reflect the milk's value had it beenused differently in a preceding month. We think this question misses themark in its focus on pricing milk as if it had been used in another class.What is intended here is that the pricing method still places the samevalue on Class II milk as before, but it may delay passing some of thatvalue to producers until a subsequent month. What will happen is that thevalue of the Class II milk each month will be based on the price announcedon the 15th day of the preceding month. In addition, the pooled value mayinclude an additional amount to reflect the fact the price announced onthe 15th of an earlier month failed to provide the intended Class II pricelevel. It is true that the dollars involved might not come out exactlythe same because there are some variations in the volumes of Class II milkfrom month to month. Nevertheless, such variations are expected to be small,and the value differences even smaller. We believe that the provisionsadopted herein achieve the intent to eliminate retroactive Class II milkpricing, while at the same time preserving the basic concept of pricingClass II milk that now is reflected in the orders.NFO's brief restated its objections to adoption of either of the proposalsincluded in the hearing notice. NFO also opposed any expedited action inthis proceeding, and urged again that no action be taken until the proposalthat it submitted for consideration, and possibly others, have been includedin a supplemental hearing notice and all such proposals have been heard.The brief further states that price timing, price level, and price areinextricably interwoven and that the Secretary cannot have a full recordto establish ``price timing'' without testimony about the price level.NFO's brief also asked that official notice be taken of the Federal Courtproceeding, including the Judge's decision, in <T3>NFO </T3>v. <T3>Lyng</T3>, No. 88-1718 (D.C.D.C.).Prior to the announcement of the hearing held in this proceeding, NFO andothers submitted additional proposals that they wanted to have includedin the Notice. NFO and Farmers Union Milk Marketing Cooperative, for example,proposed that the Class II milk price be established at a price level $.60to $1.00 over the second preceding month's M-W price. Several other proposalswere received, including some proposals to change the uses of milk thatwould be identified as Class II utilization.In response, we would point out that although these other proposals, includingthose submitted by NFO, were not included in the notice for this proceeding,they remain under consideration for possible inclusion in a hearing noticeif it is determined that another hearing should be held on a broader rangeof Class II issues. This being the case, we see no reason why it wouldbe helpful to take Official Notice of a court proceeding that has no immediatebearing on the issues before the Secretary in this proceeding. Accordingly,the request for Official Notice is denied. <ITAG tagnum="84">Rulings on Proposed Findings and Conclusions </ITAG>Briefs and proposed findings and conclusions were filed on behalf of certaininterested parties.
