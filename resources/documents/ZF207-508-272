General Services Administration.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>WITS Will Scramble NumbersandM;Candamp;P Telephone will change about 40,000 federal telephone numbers in theWashington area in the first round of changes for the Washington InteragencyTelecommunications System (WITS) early next year.andM;Candamp;P officials said in an interview last week they realize the massive changeof numbers is a sensitive issue.andP;  But it is only a small price for agenciesto pay to make the move from the existing Candamp;P Centrex service to the fullydigital network, they said.andM;The General Services Administration last January awarded Candamp;P a 10-yearcontract to supply the service.andP;  The contract has an estimated value of $300million to $800 million.andM;&quot;There is quite a shortage of codes in the Washington metro area and sotelephone numbers are at a premium,&quot; said Ed Stevens, the local Belloperating company's managing director for WITS.andM;Some &quot;critical users,&quot; such as services to the handicapped, already have beennotified of the impending number changes.andM;George H. Patton, GSA's director for WITS, noted that the number changes arenecessary because the exchanges, or NNX numbers as they are called, arecontrolled by BellCore, a company set up after the Bell System breakup.andO;BellCore is controlled by the regional Bell operating companies, such as thePhiladelphia-based Bell Atlantic Corp., Candamp;P's parent company.andM;Candamp;P officials said the switch to the WITS lines that will serve 19 federallocations will be conducted in three small operations over weekends.andP;  Candamp;Pwill complete this first group of changes by June 1, 1990.andM;Two more sets of changes to another 70,000 lines under WITS will be a yearapart.andP;  Candamp;P will handle them the same way, officials said.andP;  &quot;The firstcutover is big enough as it is.andP;  The potential for problems would be muchgreater if we were to try to do it all at once,&quot; Stevens said.andM;Although the change will not be obvious to users, Stevens and David Raff, whois Candamp;P's account executive for WITS, said Washington area agencies will get alocal service integrated voice and data network independent of the public Candamp;Pnetwork.andM;&quot;This is a fully dedicated network.andP;  Nothing is shared with the othercustomers of the public switched network [PSN].andP;  The PSN could fall flat onits face, and the only thing affected would be the trunks to the PSN,&quot;Stevens said.andM;Signaling System No.andP;  7, a standard for signaling between central offices viaa separate circuit, also will allow Integrated Services Digital Networkservices under WITS, Candamp;P officials said.andM;ATandamp;T Co., Candamp;P's subcontractor on the WITS procurement, is supplying almostall of the hardware.andP;  This includes its 5ESS switches, 2A signal transferpoints that will be used for internodal switching, and optical remotemodules.andM;The modules, in a sense, extend a switch to a remote location over a90-megabit/sec fiber-optic link and serve users who otherwise could not beserved economically by a central office switch.andM;Dedicated optical-fiber cabling will connect the 5ESS switches running ATandamp;T's5E5 Generic program to the modules.andP;  Although it was not required under thecontract, Candamp;P is building a WITS operations center at GSA headquarters.andM;Candamp;P is building a similar center adjacent to the WITS center.andP;  Both centerswill be operational next month.andM;&quot;We consider what the government has purchased from us a mini telephonecompany.andP;  It's so fully self-contained that after 10 years the governmentcould, if it wanted, hand over maintenance and management of WITS to a thirdcompany,&quot; Stevens said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
