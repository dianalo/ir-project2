ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democratic Party chairman Ronald H. Browntold his party today to carry on its debate about the role ofgovernment and be ``firm about the future of our party and ourcountry.''   Brown spoke to a meeting of the Democratic Leadership Council atwhich party leaders debated how to break their presidential campaignlosing streak.   ``For the first time in a long time we are thinking big,'' saidBrown. ``We are acting like a party that believes in sensiblegovernment.''   The party chairman said Democrats ``are also acknowledging thatwe understand the limits of government and the responsibilities ofprudent stewardship of government.   ``If we carry forward this debate vigorously, we can be firmabout the future of our party and our country because in the thickof this debate lies the seeds that will grow into our party's nextnational victory.''   The difficulty Democrats are having framing a message that willappeal to the middle class without alienating poor and minorityvoters became clear at the DLC meeting Friday when Jesse Jacksonsparred with party leaders who view him as trying to take the partyin the wrong direction.   ``The issue is not just who leads us, but who needs us,'' Jacksontold the meeting.   He urged the Democrats to declare their support for strikingEastern Airlines workers.   ``If we don't show those workers we're on their side we'remissing something big,'' Jackson said.   But Sens. Charles Robb of Virginia and Sam Nunn of Georgia madeit clear they want the party to aim its message more to the middleclass.   While acknowledging that ``we can't take our base for granted,''Robb said Democratic candidates have to convince voters that theybelieve in a strong defense and firm measures against crime.   He said one reason Democrat Michael Dukakis carried only 10states in the 1988 presidential election was that ``the Americanpeople did not view him as credible.''   He praised Jackson's eloquence and said that if the two-timecandidate for the Democratic presidential nomination would ``deliverour message, there is no question in my mind we can carry the day.''   But, Robb continued, the Democrats must ``help Jesse get thatmessage straight.''   Nunn said he agreed with Robb and added that he and Jackson``have some very fundamental differences in philosophy.''   The Georgia senator said he acknowledged that Jackson was ``oneof the people in the country who has the largest following and thepeople who support him are an extremely important element in theDemocratic Party.''   He said that any Democratic presidential candidate must be ableto bridge the different groups championed by Jackson and moreconservative Democrats.   The political assessments heard by the conference wereunrelievedly gloomy.   ``Democratic support is hemorrhaging in the heart of theelectorate,'' said Nunn, the current chairman of the DLC.   ``A party in exile,'' was how Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, theparty's 1988 vice presidential candidate, described the Democrats'status as a national party.   ``The Democratic Party has lost the ability to sustain apresidential majority based on a progressive agenda,'' said WilliamGalston, former issues adviser to Walter Mondale's presidentialcampaign in 1984 and now a professor at the University of Maryland.   ``Rather than facing reality, we have embraced the politics ofevasion,'' Galston said. ``The result has been repeated defeat. Andif we do not stop and learn and change, we will keep on losing.''   Sen. Bob Graham of Florida, the state that gave Bush his greatestmargin of victory over Democrat Michael Dukakis, talked about ``theMcDonaldization of American politics,'' and said Americans ``areelecting to buy their hamburgers at the Republican stand.''   Nunn cited the DLC's role ``as a catalyst for new thinking in theparty and the country.   But he said the DLC's progress ``has been overshadowed by alarger failure _ the collective failure of Democrats to reverse ourparty's dismal record in national presidential elections.''</TEXT></DOC>
