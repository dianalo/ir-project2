The manufacturer of such consumer brands as Glad, Prestoneand STP, cited difficulties in its antifreeze business.Fiscal 1990 per-share profit &quot;may be slightly lower thanexpectations of $2.50,&quot; compared with the year-earlier $1.97,when profit totaled $61 million.</LP><TEXT>   Profit for the third quarter, ended March 31, fell to $2.7million, or 12 cents a share, from $16.1 million, or 80 centsa share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 17% to $221.3 millionfrom $267.5 million.   Fiscal 1989 figures included $20.7 million in revenue fromthe company's European businesses, which have since beensold, the company said. Adjusting for the sale, quarterlyprofit rose fivefold to $3.5 million, or 16 cents a share,from $693,000 or three cents a share. Revenue fell 10% to$221.3 million from $246.8 million.   First Brands said that lower-than-expected antifreezesales, primarily caused by price uncertainty, had reducedoverall sales below the prior year and plan. And becausethere were added pressures to reduce antifreeze pricesfurther, it expected profit margins for the rest of the yearto be lower as well.   In addition to its problems with antifreeze, First Brandsalso has been facing criticism over the environmental claimsthe company has made about some of its products. It also hashad problems with one new-product introduction.   The Federal Trade Commission and several state attorneysgeneral have been investigating claims by First Brands andother plastic manufacturers that their products aredegradable and therefore better for the environment. Theinquiries have had no business impact and aren't expected tohave any such impact in the future, said Donald DeSantis,vice president and chief financial officer.   Earlier this year, First Brands recalled 200,000 cans of anew car-wax product, after receiving three reports that cansruptured after being weakened from the inside by corrosion.The product, Simoniz Quick Gloss, which retails for $4, is aspray-on shine for use at auto shows and in showrooms. Theproduct accounts for a very small portion of sales and hasn'taffected revenue, Mr. DeSantis said.</TEXT></DOC>
