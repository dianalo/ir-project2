Meanwhile, Cambodian government troops shelled two refugee campsrun by guerrillas just inside the Thai border, forcing theevacuation of relief workers.   Gen. Dien Del, acting commander of the Khmer People's NationalLiberation Front, said his troops had captured the town of Kandoulafter two days of attacks and were still advancing on another, SvayChiek.   ``Kandoul is a very big victory, we will for sure now take SvayChiek,'' he said.   The towns were among the objectives the guerrilla group citedSaturday when they announced a ``general offensive'' against thepro-Hanoi government in Phnom Penh.   Western sources in this border town, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said they believed Kandoul, 10 miles from the Thaifrontier, had been taken.   Dien Del also claimed his non-Communist guerrilla group, alongwith its coalition allies, had taken two government positions inthe Ampil District of Oddar Meanchey Province.   Western relief staff today were evacuated from Site 2 and Site 8refugee camps on the Thai-Cambodian frontier because of nearbyshelling, said a U.N. official in Bangkok. He spoke on condition ofanonymity.   Site 2, about 30 miles north of Aranyaprathet, has a populationof 140,000. It is the largest of the string of refugee camps on theThai frontier that shelter about 300,000 Cambodians.   It is controlled by the National Liberation Front.   Site 8, about 60 miles south of Site 2, is controlled by theradical communist Khmer Rouge guerrillas.   The relief worker said that as far as he knew, no shells hadfallen into either of the camps.   The National Liberation Front, which claims to field more than16,000 fighters, is loosely allied with the more powerful KhmerRouge and a group loyal to coalition leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk.   The Western sources said no government reinforcements hadapparently arrived along Highway 69, which runs parallel to theThai frontier. Towns along the highway have been the major targetof the guerrilla offensive, which began after the pledgedwithdrawal of all Vietnamese forces from Cambodia.   Vietnam, which invaded Cambodia in 1978 and had fought theguerrillas, says it withdrew the last of its troops last week.</TEXT></DOC>
