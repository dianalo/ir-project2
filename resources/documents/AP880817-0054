(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A woman with cerebral palsy who had twosons taken away by county officials is ending the custody fight herlawyer says ``galvanized the cause of disabled parents' rightsacross the nation.''   Tiffany Callo, 21, says she has agreed to a settlement thatwould allow her 18-month and 8-month-old boys to be raised togetherby foster parents and let her visit them every six months.   ``In this case, it just boiled down to an individual mother'sdecision that, at this point in time, it was in her children's bestinterest and her best interest to let the open adoption gothrough,'' Callo's attorney, Clay Bedford, said Monday.   Bedford said the custody proceedings Callo had faced wereunconstitutional, an ``all or nothing'' gamble that encouragesparents like Callo to settle for limited visitation. Had Callolost, he said, the children likely would have been placed in a``closed adoption,'' with visitation forever lost.   ``She would have never been able to see the kids again or hearfrom the kids again. It would have been just as if she had died orthe kids had died,'' Bedford said.   Despite the decision to end the custody battle, Bedford said thecase won support from many other disabled parents.   ``I think Tiffany has galvanized the cause of disabled parents'rights across the nation,'' he said. ``There's going to be othercases because there's a lot of disabled parents out there.''   After stories about Callo's case appeared in newspapers aroundthe country last year and earlier this year, she received dozens ofletters in support of her fight and offers to help her raise herchildren.   Callo, who needs a wheelchair to get around, said she hasdeveloped a warm relationship with the foster parents who plan toadopt the boys.   ``I feel good about them,'' Callo said of the parents. ``Thelady is taking very good care of my boys.''   Callo and the boys' father, Tony Rios, who also uses awheelchair, married in November but separated soon afterward,Bedford said. She is now seeking a divorce. Rios did not returnmessages seeking comment on the custody arrangement.   Callo's first son, David, was removed from her home by socialworkers last year. Her second son, Jessie, was removed the dayafter he was born in January. Neither boy is disabled.   Callo said Santa Clara County officials initially told her shewas incapable of caring for her children because of her disability.Later, officials cited other reasons, including her psychologicalevaluation, Callo said.</TEXT></DOC>
