Subsequently,Airbus requested a change to the A320 type design to include non-traditionalcomputerized Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) performance presentation features.The Model A320 series airplane is a short to medium-range, twinturbofan,transport category airplane with a seating capacity of 120 to 179 passengers,a maximum takeoff weight of 158,730 pounds, and a maximum operating altitudeof 39,000 feet. The manufacturer proposes to eliminate the traditional AFM takeoff performancecharts and replace them with reference to a computer program, or programs,and corresponding data files which would yield the same information. Thecomputer program proposal is ground-based and not related to onboard processingor uplinking. If the proposal is adopted, existing relevant regulations,e.g., andSection; 25.1587(b) of the FAR, would not provide adequate standards,since the required takeoff performance information would not be in a directlyusable form in the AFM itself. Under the provisions of andSection; 21.101 of the FAR, Airbus Industrie mustshow that the Model A320, as modified to incorporate the computer program,continues to meet the applicable provisions of the regulations incorporatedby reference in Type Certificate A28NM, or the applicable regulations ineffect on the date of application for the change. The regulations incorporatedby reference in the type certificate are commonly referred to as the ``originaltype certification basis.'' The certification basis for the A320 consistsof Part 25 of the FAR, as amended by Amendments 25-1 through 25-56, andSpecial Conditions 25-ANM-23. If the Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations(i.e., Part 25 as amended) do not contain adequate or appropriate standardsfor the Model A320 because of a novel or unusual AFM feature, special conditionsare prescribed under the provisions of andSection; 21.16 to establish a levelof AFM preparation and usage equivalent to that established in the regulations.Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with andSection;11.49 of the FAR after public notice, as required by andSection;andSection;11.28 and 11.29(b), and become part of the type certification basis inaccordance with andSection; 21.17(a)(2). <ITAG tagnum="84">Novel or Unusual AFM Presentation Features </ITAG>The Model A320 series airplane will incorporate the following novel orunusual AFM features: Even though operators of large transport category airplanes have used performanceanalyses programs to determine regulatory compliant performance, the approvedAFM charts have been available to represent the official minimum certifiedperformance level of the airplane, as required by regulation. The currentprocess includes engineering review and approval of the charts themselvesas part of the type certification process. The availability of the chartsto airplane operators and FAA operations personnel for establishing theacceptability of alternate ground-based computer performance analyses hasapparently been a satisfactory means of providing information concerningthe minimum performance level of the airplane. Airbus Industrie proposes elimination of the takeoff performance chartswithin the AFM, and instead proposes to show compliance with the intentof the applicable requirements of Part 25 concerning the AFM by cross-referencing(in the AFM) to equivalent results via certified performance computer programsand data files. Airbus Industrie states that, in fact, the results wouldbe the exact digital images of the otherwise-provided AFM chart. The operatorscould generate equivalent ``AFM charts'' with appropriate interpolation/readingprograms, in addition to running analysis or gross weight optimizationprograms.Airbus Industrie intends at this time to still provide traditional enrouteclimb (driftdown) and landing performance charts in the AFM. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion </ITAG>In current operational practice, neither flightcrews nor dispatchers usethe AFM on a day-to-day basis for determining limiting takeoff weights,field lengths, and speeds. Airline operations departments routinely reformatAFM source data into more usable schemes for specific airports, runways,etc. AFM charts are reviewed for accuracy and completeness, as part ofthe normal type certification process, prior to TC issuance. These dataform the master source of performance data which are used by all partiesto validate other data presentations. Federal Aviation Administration AFMmaster book libraries have been available to the public and other governmentagencies, such as NTSB and airport operators; therefore, the equivalentof current operational practice must continue if charts are to be removedfrom the A320 AFM. Applicants who plan to implement computer programs and data files as areplacement for the performance charts in the AFM are expected to obtainapproval from the FAA using the following process: a. All initial-release, individual takeoff performance entities (for aparticular airplane/engine combination) must be produced for the FAA inhard copy chart form (or table if appropriate) and included in a report.The report must be FAA approved prior to or concurrent with the AFM initialrelease in question, and will be filed as part of the FAA AFM master bookfor the public record. Tabular presentations should be limited to simplerelationships, and graphical presentations should be used when relationships,trends, or important variations in parameters need to be visualized. Subsequentperformance changes (e.g. same engine, but new rating) need not be producedin chart form, but the FAA certification office must have the capabilityto read and list the computerized performance modules referenced as AFMperformance. b. The report with hard-copy performance must have organization and identifiersto clearly relate specific charts to the performance determination process.c. The report should present performance data with the same completeness,clarity, and legibility as typical AFM charts. d. The applicant is responsible for ensuring that the FAA certificationoffice is provided with the equipment specification to use the computerfiles and any required initial instruction on use of these files. e. The applicant's total performance presentation to the air carrier mustbe such to allow that carrier to comply with andSection;andSection; 91.183(a)(5)and 121.141. <T3>Conclusion: </T3>This action affects only certain novel or unusualAFM features on one model series of airplanes. It is not a rule of generalapplicability, and it affects only the manufacturer who applied to theFAA for approval of these features on the airplane.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Parts 21 and 25 </ITAG>Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Special Conditions </ITAG>Accordingly, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) proposes the followingspecial conditions as part of the type certification basis for the AirbusIndustrie Model A320 series airplane.<ITAG tagnum="52">PARTS 21 and 25_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.

Approved data must be clearly marked and segregated from unapproved(e.g., advisory) data. f. Improper extrapolations or solutions outside of certified performancebounds must be precluded. g. Program performance output must be compatible with Configuration DeviationList (CDL) or Master Minimum Equipment List (MMEL) applications. h. Suitable program usage documentation must be available to all users,including FAA certification and operations personnel. i. Special performance charts such as thrust setting, stall speeds, stabilizertrim setting, and position error corrections must not be included in thecomputer-for-chart replacement process. j. The program must be protected from inadvertent alteration, or deliberatealteration outside of an FAA-approved revision process. k. All computerized performance software programs must be properly identifiedby a reference number which must be revised for each change in the data.l.
