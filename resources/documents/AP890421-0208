(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Missouri abortion case beingargued before the U.S. Supreme Court this week will be the firststate Attorney General William Webster has personally argued beforethe justices since being elected in 1984.   Although some observers say Webster has tried not to politicizethe case, critics wonder if the 35-year-old Republican is using itto boost his political future. Webster is already laying thegroundwork for a 1992 bid for governor.   Tony Feather, executive director of the Missouri RepublicanParty, expressed doubt that politics was behind Webster's decisionto personally argue before the court, but acknowledged the case hasnot hurt him.   ``He's already got a strong political benefit out of it by thefact that it's gone this far. I don't think he would argue it if hedidn't think he was the best attorney for it,'' Feather said.   Six Missouri cases have been heard by the U.S. Supreme Courtduring Webster's tenure.   In next week's arguments, Webster will defend a 1986 Missourilaw prohibiting the use of public funds for abortions and declaringthat human life begins at conception. Sections of the law werefound unconstitional by the U.S. District Court in Kansas City, andthat decision was upheld by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.   ``Given the publicity the case is getting, it's hard not to saythat Webster is arguing it to promote himself,'' Thomas Blumenthal,a lawyer for abortion rights advocates, said recently. ``This makesit more obvious this is a political question, not a legal one.''   Webster contends he is merely trying to do the best job possibleon the case, named Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services.   ``This is one of the most important cases of the term. It is oneof national significance and it merits my personal participation,''Webster said through a spokeswoman, Mary Jenkins.   Feather said Webster has sequestered himself in his office inrecent weeks to study the case and has shut off interviews.Webster, a former radio reporter, is usually accessible toreporters.   ``We've bent over backwards not to politicize this case,'' Ms.Jenkins said.   A native of Carthage in southwestern Missouri, Webster earned aspeech and communications degree from the University of Kansasbefore getting his law degree from the University ofMissouri-Kansas City. He practiced law in Joplin before beingelected attorney general.   When he was first elected attorney general in 1984, he was 31 _the youngest person to hold that office in Missouri in nearly 100years.   Webster is ``personally pro-life, but he feels that his personalviews are irrelevant. It is his constitutional duty to uphold thelaw,'' Ms. Jenkins said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, April 23</NOTE></DOC>
