Bencsik, widely credited for a turnaround of Datapoint Corp. but who was passed over for the chief executive officer's job, resigned as chief operating officer.    But the 56-year-old engineer, who in her brief reign as acting chief executive was one of the computer industry's highest ranking women, said she was leaving the San Antonio, Texas-based company with nothing but good feelings. &quot;I feel I am leaving with all flags flying,&quot; she said in an interview. &quot;We have a balance sheet anybody would be happy to have.&quot;    In a statement she said: &quot;As chief operating officer and acting CEO, I was charged with the task of returning Datapoint to profitability. That task is done, and Datapoint is now on a solid foundation.&quot;    The recovery was a harsh one. On her orders, the maker of computers and office-automation products laid off 786 employees, or about a third of the work force; wrote down aging, unsold equipment and paid penalties to back out of office leases. This week the company posted net income of $8.1 million for the fourth quarter ended Aug. 1 on revenue of $87.6 million.    After several months as acting chief executive, Ms. Bencsik was succeeded in the job by Robert J. Potter, who was brought in from Northern Telecom Inc. to complete the company's transformation after years of deficits and internal turmoil.    Ms. Bencsik won't sever her ties with Datapoint altogether, however. She will become a consultant to the company's chairman and major shareholder, Asher B. Edelman, a New York investor who is best known for his involvement in various takeover attempts.    Ms. Bencsik said her role as Mr. Edelman's personal consultant &quot;has yet to be defined,&quot; adding &quot;that's a conversation we have not had yet.&quot; She said she expects to discuss the position with Mr. Edelman within a week or two.    Mr. Edelman couldn't be reached. But in a statement he acknowledged that &quot;Doris took the lead at Datapoint at a crucial time in its existence.&quot; He added: &quot;I look forward to working closely with her in one of her capacities as consultant to the Edelman Group.&quot; Just yesterday, a group led by Mr. Edelman disclosed that it might seek control of Rexham Corp., a Charlotte, N.C., packaging concern.    But some of Ms. Bencsik's supporters said that consulting strayed far from the engineer's strengths. &quot;I can't imagine her in a consulting role,&quot; said Linda O'Keeffe, an analyst for Dataquest Inc., San Jose, Calif. Ms. Bencsik was &quot;a good operations person . . . a hard-nosed manager when the company needed that.&quot;    The consulting position &quot;could possibly be an interim job, a stepping stone to another manager role elsewhere,&quot; Ms. O'Keeffe speculated.    Mr. Potter, who was picked for the top corporate post, acknowledged a debt to Ms. Bencsik. &quot;Doris's work enabled me to join a much improved Datapoint,&quot; he said. &quot;It is now my task to carry Datapoint successfully forward.&quot;    A company spokesman said there weren't any immediate plans to name a new chief operating officer. </TEXT></DOC>
