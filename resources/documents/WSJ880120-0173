Assubel-Vie must decide by Feb. 1 whether to block the sale of its shares to Groupe. An Assubel-Vie spokesman said the company's board will discuss the matter next Wednesday and is likely to exercise its option to present buyers more to its liking to shareholders who want to sell their stock.    Groupe bid 6,000 Belgian francs ($171.43) for each Assubel-Vie share, valuing the company at 7.44 billion francs ($212.6 million), in a public offer that expired last Friday. The 28.3% stake would cost Groupe 2.1 billion francs at the offer price. </TEXT></DOC>
