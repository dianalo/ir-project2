Today, German soldiers are again assaulting the wall, this time under French command.    The 40 members of a West German platoon scramble up the wall and rappel back down. It is hard work, but an unrelenting French lieutenant, using a mix of German and French, orders them to go faster. &quot;Macht schnell,&quot; he shouts.    For most of the past 400 years, France and Germany have either been at war with each other or thinking about it. They last fought -- over this same Alsatian ground -- 42 years ago. But long before that, Talleyrand, Bismarck and other master plotters on both sides looked hungrily across shifting borders. Alsace has changed hands three times in this century alone.    Once again the political and military spotlight is focusing on these two often-fractious neighbors who now are trying to figure out a way to fight side by side rather than head to head. Europe is struggling with vital security questions as the U.S. considers withdrawing its mid-range land-based nuclear missiles in a pact with the Soviet Union -- and as fears grow on the Continent that, for budgetary reasons, Washington may eventually pull out its 300,000 troops. Both France and Germany dread being left exposed to the Warsaw Pact's overwhelming superiority in conventional and chemical arms. Neither is sure how to fill the vacuum.    &quot;There is more and more worry in France the closer we get to the total de-nuclearization of Europe,&quot; says former French Foreign Minister Jean Francois-Poncet. &quot;Then maybe the U.S. troops will go, too. And even if there was equilibrium of conventional forces, well, that wouldn't exactly please us,&quot; he says. &quot;We've had two world wars in Europe this century when conventional forces were more or less in equilibrium.&quot;    These fears have brought new urgency to the renewal of peaceful Franco-German ties that began in earnest a decade ago. Experts on both sides of the border say that relations between Paris and Bonn now are the best they have been since the war and that European cooperation, on defense and other matters, is no longer just a dream. This time, with the two nations united by their common security fears, rapprochement should last.    &quot;France's defense can't be independent of West Germany's,&quot; says Francois Fillon, a defense expert and member of the French National Assembly. &quot;There is no other path but a reinforced Franco-German axis.&quot; Echoes Lothar Ruehl, the second-ranking official at the West German Defense Ministry: &quot;There is no security to be had for France alone. In practical terms they will come to our defense. We are sure of that.&quot;    But the same experts concede that serious problems are braking the pace of this cooperation and limiting its potential. Neither France nor Germany feels secure outside the U.S.'s nuclear or conventional umbrella. Both will try to keep U.S. troops in Europe. Neither seems entirely comfortable being dependent on the other. Memories die hard.    Right now, for instance, the trial in Lyon of Klaus Barbie, the former Gestapo chief there, is reminding France of German atrocities during World War II. West Germany, barred from having nuclear weapons by the treaty ending that war, has long been more comfortable with missiles controlled by the U.S. than with those controlled by its ancient enemy. France won't let a German finger anywhere near its nuclear button.    &quot;There are good reasons for distrust on both sides,&quot; says a former French cabinet minister. &quot;We French haven't always been good neighbors. They had Hitler, but we had Louis XIV and Napoleon.&quot;    In part because of mutual distrust, the two countries' motives for closer relations differ fundamentally. France wants to cement its ties to West Germany to prevent Bonn's sliding toward neutrality. There is no pacifist movement in France as there is in West Germany, a French military expert points out. He predicts that &quot;Gorbachev's first visit to West Germany after a missile treaty will be a triumph.&quot; The Germans, on the other hand, want to use closer cooperation to draw the French back into NATO's military wing.    Events, however, are forcing the two countries to work out an understanding. One forum for this is the newly revived Western European Union. Since Britain is also a member, both France and Germany can enthusiastically back WEU initiatives without touching off domestic political problems.    The WEU's revival is itself a reflection of closer ties between France and West Germany. The seven-nation forum on defense policy was founded in 1954 as a way to control German rearmament. Its charter limited West Germany's production of conventional arms and, as a result, Paris and Bonn were constantly at loggerheads.    France wanted to revive the WEU, but West Germany, seeing it as an organization synonymous with discrimination against Bonn, didn't. Then, in 1984, conventional-arms sanctions were lifted after extensive consultations between the two countries, paving the way for the WEU's first ministerial meeting in more than a decade.    The latest flowering of the Franco-German relationship dates to the 1970s, nourished by the personal friendship between French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing and West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt. The two spoke frequently by phone, usually in English. They shared uncertainty about U.S. leadership and the hope that a Franco-German alliance would one day form the nucleus for a common European defense apart from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.    Only two weeks after Mr. d'Estaing was elected in 1974, Mr. Schmidt paid him his first official visit. Over the next eight years, Mr. Schmidt repeatedly sought to tighten Franco-German military cooperation. He suggested a fully integrated fighting force with a French general in command. He wanted France to extend its nuclear guarantee to Germany. And, in a speech to the West German parliament in 1984, he proposed that the two countries together deploy 30 fully equipped land divisions, about one-third more than current manpower -- with Germany footing most of the bill.    Jacques Chirac, France's prime minister, calls Mr. Schmidt's proposals &quot;ideal goals, but difficult to achieve quickly.&quot;    Cooperation is hamstrung by domestic considerations in both nations. As Mr. Schmidt discovered, there isn't much popular support for higher defense outlays in Germany, a nation haunted by its Nazi past and its divided territory. And the French cling to an isolationist military doctrine. Says Mr. Schmidt: &quot;Almost all of my French partners stood more or less under the influence of de Gaulle's strategic thought.&quot;    That doctrine, which still dominates French military thinking, stresses nationalistic independence and the protection of French territory rather than the collective security of its allies. In 1965, the policy led to France's removal of its forces from front-line positions in Germany and its withdrawal, a year later, from NATO's military structure.    The relationship has nevertheless been extended by the present leaders, President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who, in a moving ceremony in 1984, symbolically buried past differences when they joined hands on the World War I battlefield of Verdun. Today consultation between France and West Germany over foreign affairs and military issues is more systematic and closer than the contacts between any other two governments in Western Europe. Last month, President Mitterrand, Prime Minister Chirac and Chancellor Kohl held the 49th summit between the two nations' leaders since 1963, when de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer signed a treaty to promote Franco-German friendship.    Still, cooperation isn't easy. Language is one obstacle. At a French training facility in Hartheim, West Germany, a French corporal, who doesn't speak German, is trying to communicate an assignment to the German squad he commands. He gestures wildly with his hands, but the squad still shuffles about in confusion. Visibly frustrated, the corporal finally fetches a bilingual German officer, who explains the task. (The most popular second language in both countries' schools is English.)    Economics is another obstacle. As one step to strengthen the Franco-German military alliance, the two nations in March revived plans to jointly build a new attack helicopter, with each country buying more than 200 of the craft. The project, which could cost $10 billion all told, including development costs, was first proposed in 1976, collapsed over the cost, was revived in 1984 and collapsed again last year.    One of the biggest quarrels was over the helicopter's seating arrangement. The Germans wanted the pilot and co-pilot seated one in front of the other, the configuration preferred by the military. France -- whose military exports represent a big part of its foreign trade -- wanted side-by-side seating so that the helicopter could also be sold for civilian use abroad. Germany seems to have won on the seating, and negotiations are supposed to be completed by July.    &quot;We could make a lot more progress in armaments cooperation,&quot; complains one German defense official, &quot;if the French weren't always looking out for the interests of their industry.&quot;    There are more substantive problems, too. The French have made it clear to Bonn that they wouldn't be able to replace the U.S. security umbrella with either a nuclear or a conventional guarantee of their own. The French worry that if they put French missiles on German soil, the Germans would want too much control over their use.    Nonetheless, several French officials, most recently Foreign Minister Jean-Bernard Raimond, have publicly affirmed France's commitment to defend West German territory at its eastern border, on the Elbe, rather than at the Rhine, on its western border.    The teeth in such pledges are the 50 or so joint maneuvers conducted each year by French and German military forces. In September, the two nations will engage in their most extensive joint exercise ever. France's 47,000-man Rapid Action Force, a unit created in 1983 to strengthen France's conventional defense of Western Europe, especially against Russian tanks, will come under the command of German forces during the maneuvers.    France, meanwhile, intends to increase its nuclear warheads fivefold by the early 1990s, upgrading both its long- and short-range arsenals. Its battlefield nuclear weapon, the Pluton, is scheduled to be replaced by the Hades, which has three times the range and twice the firepower. The new weapon will be able to strike targets in Eastern Europe directly rather than just hit Warsaw Pact forces after they have invaded West German territory.    Before the Hades is deployed, Germany wants assurances of the conditions under which it would be used. The two countries are now engaged in consultations over the issue, and they plan to install a &quot;hot line&quot; between Paris and Bonn. But progress on the issue has been slow, according to one German official involved in the talks. &quot;The French,&quot; he says, &quot;have no habit of dealing with outsiders on nuclear matters.&quot;    Cooperation is easier with conventional weapons. France and Germany now conduct more than 40 programs for the joint development of military hardware, including missiles, artillery and other munitions. More than half of the supplies purchased by the German military are jointly developed with other European nations, mainly France.    But bilateral disputes are still common, and often economics is the source of tension. The French remain obsessed with German economic success and frustrated that no matter how well they seem to do, the Germans always do better.    It is a complicated relationship, says Mr. Francois-Poncet, the former French foreign minister, &quot;even though both countries regard each other as their best friends.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
