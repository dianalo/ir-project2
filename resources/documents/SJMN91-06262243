That'safter years of falling behind inflation. Some San Jose schools limit teachersto 500 photocopies a semester. In wealthier Saratoga, one teacher's materialsallocation was reduced a whopping 40 percent this year to only $150.;   Likederelicts on the streets, teachers and principals are appealing to localbusinesses for used and recyclable supplies. Parent-teacher organizations thatonce raised money for band uniforms now buy textbooks and pencils. And thecharity isn't enough. In city or suburb, it's easy to find teachers who spendabout $1,000 of their own money for basic supplies.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  PAPER PAUPERSWHEN TEACHERS HAVE TO DIG INTO THEIR OWN POCKETS,CLASSROOM MORALE SINKS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Ironically, teachers today are being asked to be independent and creative.That means doing more things like writing their own math problems and spellinglists and publishing student writings for class discussion. Of course, thatrequires more paper and pencils.;   What is pauperizing the schools? A numberof factors, including inadequate local and state funding, federal stinginess,union strangleholds on staffing and bad budget decisions.;   We wonder whatadministrators and school boards were thinking when they slashedclassroom-supply budgets. They had to figure teachers and parents for softies.They had to count on a few local businesses to donate out of pity if not aspirit of partnership.;   The charity is commendable, but it is not howparents, teachers and industry can best help education. Principals andadministrators should be asking industry for managerial advice and teachingtalent; teachers and parents should be helping to reorganize schools andrevise the curriculum, not shopping for crayons.;   When teachers have to diginto their own pockets, morale and confidence in the classroom sink. Worse,the public doesn't get the true picture of school distress. We're tempted tosuggest that teachers not buy the materials. That might exert more pressurefor change. It might even lower the resistance to tax increases that willbenefit schools. It's an appealing thought, but unrealistic.;   As long assupplies run low, caring teachers should be admired for doing what has to bedone. Unlike bureaucrats and politicians who merely mouth the merits of schoolreform, these teachers know what back-to-basics really means.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910918  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  364  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, September 18, 199100262243,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
