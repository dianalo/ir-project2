RicksStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/23/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> WNEWSSECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Securities and Exchange Commission named New York lawyer Lawrence Iason head of its important New York office.    The appointment of Mr. Iason, 42 years old, appeared to end months of turmoil in the office that began with the short tenure of Kathleen Warwick, who was appointed to the post in November 1986 and resigned last September. As previously reported, growing dissension between the New York office's enforcement personnel and Ms. Warwick demoralized SEC attorneys and investigators handling insider-trading cases.    &quot;It certainly ends the uncertainty,&quot; said Robert Blackburn, the SEC's senior trial counsel in New York. He characterized Mr. Iason as a lawyer of &quot;stature, credibility and intelligence.&quot;    Mr. Iason hasn't previously worked for the SEC, but in the 1970s he was a prosecutor in the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan. For three of his years as a federal prosecutor he specialized in securities fraud.    Peter Romatowski, a former colleague of Mr. Iason in the New York U.S. attorney's office, said, &quot;He'll be a very good person in the present circumstance, where they've had a morale problem, because he's effective with people. He's also got indisputable credentials in enforcement, which the New York office will regard highly.&quot; He added that Mr. Iason, while &quot;soft-spoken,&quot; is &quot;as hard-working and thorough a lawyer as I've ever run across.&quot;    Mr. Iason declined to discuss his plans for the New York office, which has about 200 staff members and is the SEC's most important post outside Washington. He said he decided to take the job &quot;because I think it's a great office, and a wonderful time to be there.&quot; Mr. Iason said he would have to recuse himself from certain pending cases, but wouldn't elaborate.    He said he has handled &quot;several&quot; insider-trading cases as a defense lawyer with the firm of Obermaier, Morvillo, Abramowitz andamp; Iason, but wouldn't discuss specific cases. Among his past clients is Daniel Covello, a former vice president of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., who was charged with insider trading by the SEC in 1983. Mr. Covello entered into a settlement under which he neither admitted nor denied guilt, and agreed to return $70,351 in alleged profit.    That case was part of a larger matter involving insider trading based on takeover plans allegedly leaked by employees of a New York law firm.    A 1967 graduate of Yale and a 1971 graduate of New York University's law school, Mr. Iason held an appeals-court clerkship following law school, and then served as a prosecutor with the Watergate Special Prosecution Force for about 18 months.    Mr. Iason said he expects to begin work at the SEC late next month. </TEXT></DOC>
