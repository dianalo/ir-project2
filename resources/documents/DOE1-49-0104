Here, however, it is irreplaceable. The potentials of indigenoussolar energy utilization are described and the favourable boundary conditionsare listed. Up to the year 2000, solar energy can contribute 6 to 10%to the national primary energy supply, and up to the year 2030, it canbe approximately 15 to 20%. The higher values can be achieved all theearlier, the more consequent a rational energy utilization can providea decrease in the energy demand level and the stricter the 'internalization'of external costs can increase the energy cost level. In the centuryto come, solar energy in the form of solar hydrogen might become an importedgood, which will be yielded electrolytically from water in areas of theworld with the highest insolation and will then be transported to theindustrial areas, where it will be recombined to water again by givingup its energy. The established linear hydrocarbon energy system willreceive the first natural cycle components from the solar-universal hydrogenenergy system. The input will be solar radiation and water, and the outputwater and heat. The system will be ecologically neutral.</TEXT></DOC>
