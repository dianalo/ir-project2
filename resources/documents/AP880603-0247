DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former president of the Wedtech Corp.testified Friday that Attorney General Edwin Meese III asked himabout a multimillion dollar Navy contract that Meese has deniedhelping the defense contractor obtain.   Anthony Guariglia, the former Wedtech president, testified atthe racketeering trial of U.S. Rep. Mario Biaggi that Meese askedabout the Navy pontoon contract at a 1985 ball in Washington.   Guariglia and other company officials have testified they paid$800,000 to attorney E. Robert Wallach to influence the attorneygeneral.   They have said Wallach, a close friend and former lawyer ofMeese's, told them he got Meese to intercede on the company'sbehalf for a series of contracts worth $143 million to buildpontoons or floating, portable docks.   Guariglia was the first witness to testify about anything Meeseallegedly said about the contract.   Guariglia told jurors at the 13-week-old trial at federal courtin Manhattan that Wallach introduced him, Wedtech founder JohnMariotta and other officials of the Bronx-based company to Meeseand his wife at an ambassador's ball in Washington.   ``Mr. Wallach said to Mr. Meese, what a fine job we were doingin the South Bronx, that the company was growing and employment wasgrowing,'' said Guariglia. ``Mr. Meese asked how we were doing withthe pontoon contract. Mr. Mariotta said fine. Mr. Meese asked if wewere on time with our deliveries, and I believe Mr. Mariotta saidfine, and that was the end of the meeting.''   Meese, who has not been charged with any wrongdoing, haspreviously denied any involvement in the pontoon contract. He hasadmitted intervening with the Army on behalf of Wedtech's attemptsto win an engine contract in 1982, while he was presidentialcounselor.   Meese attorney Nathan Lewin said because the attorney generalwas in Germany ``I can't give any direct comment on whether herecalls or doesn't recall making that statement.''   Lewin, reached at his Washington office, added, ``If thatstatement was made by him (Meese) it is consistent with hisstatements concerning his limited involvement or knowledge ofWedtech matters.''   Meese was not involved in obtaining the contract for Wedtech,said Lewin, adding that Meese ``has acknowledged that he had beentold by Wallach that Wedtech had obtained a pontoon contract.''   Wallach is under indictment on federal racketeering charges forallegedly taking payoffs from Wedtech officials to influence Meeseand other public officials.   Biaggi, Mariotta and five others are accused in the ongoingtrial of turning Wedtech, which is now in bankruptcy, into aracketeering enterprise for the payment of bribes to obtain no-bidgovernment contracts.   Guariglia is the last of four former Wedtech officials who havepleaded guilty to corruption charges to testify at the Biaggi trialin exchange for leniency.</TEXT></DOC>
