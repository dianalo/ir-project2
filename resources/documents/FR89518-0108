L. 98-473, as amendedby the Children's Justice and Assistance Act of 1986 (CJA), Pub. L. 99-401,and as amended by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Title VII, SubtitleD, of Pub. L. 100-690 (hereinafter referred to as the ``Act''). The Victimsof Crime Act has been codified at 44 U.S.C. 10601, <T3>et seq.</T3>The Act provides Federal financial assistance to states for the purposeof compensating and otherwise assisting victims of crime and, also, providesfunds for training and technical assistance and assisting victims of Federalcrimes. These Program Guidelines provide program background, eligibilityrequirements, and administrative procedures for the implementation of thecrime victim assistance grant program as outlined in section 1404 (a) ofthe Act. The Guidelines are based on the experience gained during the firstfour years of the programs's implementation and are responsive to the amendmentsto the Victims of Crime Act of 1984. These Guidelines suspersede all previousProgram Guidelines issued by the Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) to imiplementthe Victims of Crime Act victim assistance grant program.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Duane Ragan, Ph.D, (202) 724-5947.(This is not a toll free number).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On March 7, 1989, the Office for Victimsof Crime published for public comment proposed Program Guidelines for theVictims of Crime Act (VOCA) victim assistance grant program in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (Vol. 54, No. 43, Pages 9571-9580). In responseto this publication OVC received 126 individual comments from Congress,national organizations, VOCA state administrators, state advisory groups,statewide and national coalitions, victim service providers, victim advocates,and crime victims.The Proposed Guidelines contained a complete discussion of all policy issuesand program requirements. Commenters were generally appreciative and supportiveof the clarification provided regarding allowable costs, eligible programs,and eligible services. The concerns expressed can be grouped into sevenmajor policy issues which include: perpetrator rehabilitation, genericvictim services, seed money, underserved populations, program match, andallowable costs and eligible services.In addition to written comments, OVC solicited and received oral commentsfrom representatives of several national organizations in the field ofvictim services. All comments were considered by OVC in preparing the finalProgram Guidelines. OVC does not plan to provide individual written responsesto each of the comments received. However, an analysis of the commentsreceived and OVC's response in provided below.<ITAG tagnum="85">Summary of the Comments to the Proposed Program Guidelines</ITAG>In the proposed and final Program Guidelines OVC attempted to adhere closelyto the letter and spirit of the legislation. The primary purpose of theVOCA victim assistance grant program is to assist states in providing high-qualityservices that directly improve the health and well-being of victims ofcrime with priority given to victims of child abuse, domestic violence,and sexual assault and services for previously underserved victim populations.OVC notes that 37 letters came from domestic violence programs and domesticviolence coalitions. Several major themes clearly emerged from this groupof commenters. These writers were generally unsupportive of: (1) Any VOCAfunds being set aside for victims other than victims of sexual assault,domestic violence, and child abuse; (2) classifying underserved populationsas a new priority area; and (3) any limitation on multi-year funding forpriority programs. In addition, domestic violence programs and coalitions,along with other programs, almost uniformly agreed that perpetrator rehabilitationin family violence cases should not be supported with VOCA funding.OVC also received 13 comments from groups which provide services to sexualassualt victims who also identified general areas of concern and unanimouslysupported and opposed specific provisions of the proposed Program Guidelines.They opposed any attempt by states to limit the number of years for whicha designated priority program would be eligible for funding and specificallyrequested that OVC issue language prohibiting this practice. This groupalso urged OVC not to identify previously underserved victim populationsas a new or fourth priority. Both domestic violence and sexual assaultprograms requested that OVC more strongly state that priority programsnot be required to provide ``generic'' services.Comments received from the VOCA state administrators tended to focus onadministrative aspects of the VOCA victim assistance grant program. Ofthe 15 VOCA state administrators who submitted comments, 8 expressed theirviews regarding the allocation of a percentage of VOCA victim assistancefunds to the previously underserved victim populations. These VOCA stateadministrators generally agreed that no percentage should be allocatedto perviously underserved victim populations thus providing the stateswith the maximum flexibility to determine the amount to be allocated forthis purpose. VOCA state administrators also requested that OVC expandupon the allowable costs and eligible services section of the final ProgramGuidelines.OVC received a joint letter from two members of the House of Representatives,Representative John Conyers, Chairman of the Committee on Government Operations,and Representative George Miller, Chairman, Select Committee on Children,Youth, and Families. These congressional representatives reiterated theirpositions on the purposes of priority programs (i.e., to foster specializedservices) and seed money for new programs (i.e., to favor existing programsover newer ones). Moreover, they reasserted their opposition to the proposedrequirement for a minimum 10% to support previously underserved populations,relying on their interpretation that the House never intended this newcategory to be treated like the three original priorities.In contrast to the views expressed by Representatives Conyers and Milleron the proposed treatment of previously underserved victim populations,Senator Joseph Biden, Jr., Chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary,wrote to OVC stating that ``I believe that the department's guidelinesrequiring states to devote at least ten percent of their victim assistancefunds to previously underserved populations of victims is consistent withthe explicit language contained in the 1988 drug bill and the intent ofthe authors of the victim assistance amendments.''Finally, OVC received a wide range of letters from other national and localorganizations which focused upon one or two issues. Among these nationaland local organizations, OVC received strong support for: (1) Establishinga minimum of 10% funding in each state for their respective previouslyunderserved populations; (2) changing the match requirement for new progams;(3) programs providing crisis intervention services receiving priorityfunding consideration; (4) special consideration to Native Americans; and(5) the statement regarding seed money for new programs.<ITAG tagnum="85">Analysis of and Response to Comments on the Proposed Program Guidelines</ITAG>1. <T3>Perpetrator Rehabilitation. </T3>Nearly half of the comments (64) receivedurged OVC to reconsider the proposal to allow perpetrator counseling toreunite families in domestic violence cases as an eligible service to besupported by VOCA victim assistance grant funds. Comments were receivedfrom a broad cross-section of programs and agencies, including VOCA stateadministrators, battered women shelters, national organizations, rape crisiscenters, and general victim services programs. The majority of the commentson this issue came from domestic violence programs and coalitions.After careful consideration of these comments, OVC has amended the finalGuidelines to state that ``perpetrator rehabilitation is clearly not adirect service to victims of crime as intended by VOCA and, therefore,not an eligible service or activity to be supported by victim assistancegrant funds.''2. <T3>Generic Victim Services. </T3>Approximately 54 letters were received(of which 17 came from individuals associated with one organization) requestingthat OVC issue a stronger statement that priority programs need not provide``generic'' victim services or extend services to other non-priority victimsin order to be eligible for funding. OVC wishes to reiterate even morestrongly that there is no requirement that each program designated as apriority program provide what are termed as generic victim services. Further,there is no requirement that all VOCA-funded programs must serve all typesof victims.3. <T3>Seed Money. </T3>OVC received a substantial number of comments (53)on the use of VOCA assistance funds as money to seed the development ofnew programs. Commenters generally agreed that OVC should issue a strongerstatement prohibiting states from limiting the number of years a programmay apply for crime victim assistance grants. OVC believes that this issueis best left to the individual states because of the careful balance thatstates must maintain in appropriately funding victim service programs tomeet the divergent needs of their victim populations. However, state administratorsare discouraged from establishing a blanket policy of terminating fundingto programs receiving awards in previous years solely to fund new programs.4. <T3>Previously Underserved Populations. </T3>OVC received 53 comments (ofwhich 17 were from individuals associated with one organization) from priorityvictim organizations requesting that child abuse, sexual assault, and domesticviolence programs be eligible for consideration as previously underservedpopulations. However, given the clear intent of the amendment to the legislationto broaden the support for crime victim services into other areas previouslylacking funding support, this is not permissible. It is important to notethat although a minimum of 30% has previously been set aside for the threepriority area programs, experience has shown that states have allocatedthe majority of VOCA funds to programs which serve victims of child abuse,domestic violence, and sexual assault. (Seventy-six percent of the moniesallocated to state victim assistance programs went to programs servingpriority area victims. These monies funded 82% of the VOCA supported programs.)Therefore, states will be asked to identify victims of crime other thanthose included in the three priority categories in order to fulfill thisrequirement.The letter received from Representatives John Conyers and George Millerrestated their position that the proposed Guidelines were not in keepingwith their interpretation of Congressional intent regarding underservedpopulations. They believe that the intent of the House of Representativeswas that the original priority areas were to be treated more favorablythan the recently recognized underserved populations.The letter received from Senator Joseph Biden, Jr. strongly supported thenotion that the proposed minimum 10% allocation for previously underservedpopulations effectuated the intent of the amendment. According to SenatorBiden when the Senate sought to require states to give consideration tounderserved populations of victims similar to the three original priorityareas, the Committee used language which was identical to the legislativelanguage in the original Victims of Crime Act. Senator Biden indicatedthat he and Senator Thurmond, as authors of VOCA in 1984 and co-managersof the criminal justice amendments in the 1988 drug bill, inserted a section-by-sectionanalysis of the Senate amendments into the Congressional Record. This analysiscalled on the Department of Justice to issue a minimum funding requirementfor underserved populations that was identical to the requirement implementingVOCA's three original priority areas. Senator Biden, quoting the <T3>Congressional Record,</T3> wrote that:<ITAG tagnum="21">In keeping with the Department's guidelines implementing the prioritylanguage of section 1404(A) of the Act, the (Judiciary) Committee directsthe Attorney General to issue guidelines that ensure that at least tenpercent of a state's victims assistance fund shall be used to provide grantsto programs serving previously underserved victim populations, includingfor example, survivors of homicide victims and victims of drunk and druggeddriving incidents (134 Cong. Rec., October 14, 1988, S15960).</ITAG>OVC also received letters from two national organizations (National VictimsCenter and Mothers Against Drunk Driving), representing hundreds of victimservice programs, supporting OVC's proposal to set aside 10% for previouslyunderserved victims. These two organizations recommended that OVC definepreviously underserved victim populations by type of crime. Consistentwith references in the <T3>Congressional Record,</T3> states are encouraged to identify previouslyunderserved populations of victims by type of crime, e.g., victims of DUIand DWI, survivors of homicide victims, and other victims of violent crime,or Native American victims of crime on Indian reservations. OVC has includedNative American victims because of the paucity of victim services on Indianreservations and their lack of access to existing services.Related to this same issue, comments received suggested that: (1) Statesbe asked to give preference to programs serving previously underservedvictim populations with no specific percentage allocated, (2) the 10% allocatedrepresents a funding ceiling, and (3) the previously underserved victimpopulations should not be considered a new or fourth priority category.In implementing the program requirement for previously underserved victims,the OVC has considered the conflicting perspectives expressed by Congressand constituency groups. The rationale for establishing a specific levelof funding for previously underserved victims of violent crime is to promotethe broadest effort possible to assist these victims and to ensure thatno category of victim is ignored. With regard to the degree of financialsupport that should be made available to previously underserved victims,OVC is directing states to allocate at least 10% of their VOCA victim assistancefunds to previously underserved victims of violent crime. In this way,one or more previously underserved populations of victims of violent crime,as identified by each state, will constitute a single category for whichat least 10% of the state's VOCA victim assistance funds must be allocated.That is to say, for example, if a state were to designate two types ofvictims as previously underserved for purposes of this section, both populations<T3>together </T3>would share the minimum 10% funding required.5. <T3>Definition of a Priority Program.</T3> Thirty-one commenters recommendedthat OVC expand its definition of a priority program to include ``specialized''services. Included in these was a joint letter from Representatives Conyersand Miller supporting this wording. OVC has considered these comments andbelieves this would be helpful in clarifying what is a priority programfor purpose of VOCA. Therefore, OVC defines a priority program as one whoseprincipal mission is to offer comprehensive specialized services tailoredto the special needs of one or more priority category victims. OVC encouragesstates to consult with victim service providers, victim advocates, crimevictims, etc., in order to identify the appropriate specialized services.6. <T3>Program Match. </T3>OVC carefully reviewed recommendations to retainthe current match requirement for new programs and to restrict programmatch to <T3>cash</T3> only for new programs. A few writers expressed concern thatnew programs could use in-kind as well as cash match. Additionally, theyexpressed concern regarding the relative reduction in the amount of matchnecessary for new versus existing programs. Commenters suggested that thismight send a signal to states that funding new victim programs should receivepriority over funding existing victim service programs. <T3>This was not the intent of the proposed changes in match requirements.</T3>OVC recognizes that a primary purpose of the Victims of Crime Act, as amended,is to expand and enhance the delivery of services to crime victims providedby existing victim assistance programs. The new match requirements reflectthe intent of the Act regarding the continuity of existing crime victimassistance programs and address the need for the development of necessaryvictim service programs.7. <T3>Other Revisions. </T3>Several VOCA administrators requested clarificationon allowable costs and eligible services. The following is a breakdownof those issues and OVC's response.a. <T3>Legal Services. </T3>Writers inquired whether legal services includethe filing of elder abuse petitions and child abuse petitions, as wellas temporary restraining orders. OVC considers these to be allowable activitiesto be supported by VOCA victim assistance funds. OVC believes these arethe types of necessary and essential emergency legal services which aidin removing the victim from immediate revictimization as contemplated bythe VOCA. All other, non-emergency, legal services are not allowable.b. <T3>Insurance. </T3>Additional questions arose regarding building and vehicleinsurance and the necessary maintenance and repair of a building or a vehicleusing VOCA victim assistance funds. The purchase of liability insurancepolicies and the repair of buildings and vehicles are incidental expensesand do not appear to be necessary to the provision of direct services tocrime victims as intended by the Act. Therefore, VOCA victim assistancegrant funds may not be used for these purposes.c. <T3>Rent. </T3>Commenters inquired whether the cost of rent may be chargedto a VOCA victim assistance grant. A subgrantee may charge, or prorate,the reasonable cost of rent for a VOCA-funded project. The grantee/subgranteeshall certify in writing that the requested rental charge is consistentwith the prevailing rate in the local area and shall maintain documentationin its file to support such a determination.d. <T3>Equipment Purchases and Capital Expenditures. </T3>Section 1404(b)(2)provides that VOCA victim assistance grant funds may only be used to provideservices to victims of crime. However, equipment that is necessary andessential to the delivery of direct services is deemed an allowable costby OVC.The Office for Victims of Crime has considered carefully the recommendationsof the many commenters. This consideration has led to a number of revisionsand further clarification in the final Program Guidelines. These revisionsreflect OVC's objective to carry out the purpose of VOCA, while takinginto consideration the diverse coalitions of victim service providers,victim advocates, state administrators, national organizations, crime victims,and members of Congress.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Victim Assistance Grant Program, Background, LegislativeChanges, and Program Policy </ITAG>The fundamental approach of these Program Guidelines is to maximize stateauthority within the context of congressional intent of the Act. In thisway, Federal intrusion on the states' decision-making authority will beappropriately limited. Indeed, from its inception, the Act has stronglyfavored state autonomy within Federally determined guidelines. Programapplication, reporting, and evaluation requirements have been establishedat a level necessary to maintain proper Federal stewardship for the fundsand to report to the President and Congress on the impact of the funding.These Guidelines do not constitute a ``major'' rule as defined by ExecutiveOrder 12291 as they do not result in: (a) An effect on the economy of $100million or more; (b) a major increase in any costs or prices; or (c) adverseeffects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, or innovationamong American enterprises. In addition, because these Guidelines will not have significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities, no analysis of the impactof these rules on such entities is required by the Regulatory FlexibilityAct, 5 U.S.C. 601, <T3>et seq. </T3>The collection of information requirements contained in Section V of theProgram Guidelines has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget(OMB) for review under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3504(h).The primary purpose of the VOCA victim assistance grant program is to assiststates in providing high quality services that directly improve the healthand well-being of victims of crime and to provide funding for sexual assault(rape crisis programs), spousal abuse (domestic violence shelters), childabuse (treatment programs), and previously underserved victim populations.A wide range of services for victims of crime are supported by this Act.They include, but are not limited to, ensuring that victims receive timelynotification about the various proceedings involved in prosecuting theperson accused of the crime and counseling to help the victim overcomethe emotional trauma of victimization. Congress has supported the viewthat some services are more directly related to the emotional healing andrecovery of the victim than others. Since there are not enough dollars available in the Crime Victim Fund topermit funding all victim services, it is the intent of VOCA to ensurethat services that directly improve the health and well-being of crimevictims receive first consideration when planning the distribution of limitedCrime Victim Fund monies. The Office for Victims of Crime encourages stateadministrators to consider first the funding of programs that offer counselingservices, shelter, and other emergency assistance that address the devastatingpsychological and emotional consequences experienced by victims of crimeand their families. Consequently, programs meeting the immediate short-termemergency needs of crime victims should be considered for funding overprograms offering other types of services with the exception of programswhose primary purposes are to aid survivors of homicide victims and forwhom services may be delayed beyond the initial crisis. <ITAG tagnum="84">Crime Victims Fund Distribution </ITAG>The reauthorization legislation establishes a ceiling of $125 million inFiscal Years 1989-1991 and $150 million to Fiscal Years 1992-1994 for theCrime Victims Fund (hereinafter referred to as the ``Fund''). Monies deposited in the Fund shall be made available in the following manner.Of the first $100 million deposited in the Fund: 49.5% shall be made availablefor victim compensation program grants; 45% shall be made available forvictim assistance program grants; 1% shall be available for support ofservices to Federal crime victims (of which up to 0.5% may be made availablefor training and technical assistance projects for eligible victim assistanceprograms and at least 0.5% may be made available for services to victimsof Federal crimes), and 4.5% shall be made available under the provisionsof the Children's Justice and Assistance Act of 1986. Of the 4.5% madeavailable to the Department of Health and Human Services to improve theinvestigation and prosecution of child abuse, especially child sexual abusecases, 15% shall be made available for assisting Native American tribesin developing, establishing, and operating programs designed to similarlyimprove the handling of child abuse cases, especially child sexual abusecases in Indian country. This 15% shall be administered by the Office forVictims of Crime. The next $5,500,000 deposited in the Fund above the first $100 million(i.e., any amounts between $100 million and $105.5 million) shall be madeavailable for Children's Justice Act grant purposes. Deposits in excessof $105,500,000, but <T3>not </T3>in excess of $110 million ceiling, shall be made availablefor victim assistance program grants. Of deposits in excess of the $110 million and up to the ceiling, 47.5%shall be made available for victim compensation program grants, 47.5% shallbe made available for victim assistance program grants, and 5% shall bemade available for services to victims of Federal crimes. If the total deposited in the Fund during a particular year reaches theceiling, the excess shall not be a part of the Fund. The first $2.2 millionof such excess shall be available to the Federal judicial branch for administrativecosts to carry out the functions of the Administrative Office of the U.S.Courts with respect to the collection of criminal fines and penalty assessments.(See subsection 1402(c)(1)(A)) The remaining monies shall be depositedin the General Fund of the United States Treasury. No deposits shall be made in the Fund after September 30, 1994, under thecurrent reauthorization. <ITAG tagnum="84">Recent Changes in the Distribution of Victim Assistance Funds to theStates </ITAG>The 1988 amendments to the Victims of Crime Act increased the base amounteach state shall receive in victim assistance funds from $100,000 to $150,000for Fiscal Years 1989, 1990, and 1991, and to $200,000 for Fiscal Years1992, 1993, and 1994. (See section 1404(a)(5) (A) and (B)) In addition, for the purposes of allocating the base amounts to the states,the United States Virgin Islands and all territories and possessions ofthe United States are to be included along with the District of Columbiaand Puerto Rico. (See section 1404(d)(1)]<ITAG tagnum="85">Victims of Crime Act Victim Assistance Grant Program Final ProgramGuidelines </ITAG>I. General Provisions of the Final Guidelines <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Eligible Applicants </ITAG>All states including the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of PuertoRico, the United States Virgin Islands, and all other territories and possessionsof the United States are eligible to apply for and receive Victims of CrimeAct victim assistance grants. (See section 1404(d)(1) of the Act) For thepurpose of these proposed Guidelines, the term ``state'' includes the Districtof Columbia, Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, and any otherterritory or possession of the United States (See section 1404(d)(1) ofthe Act).<ITAG tagnum="81">B. State Office </ITAG>The chief executive of each participating state must designate or establisha state office for the purpose of preparing an application for funds andadministering the funds received, including fund accounting and disbursement,monitoring, reporting, and audit. II. Allocation of Funds <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Fund Availability </ITAG>Section 1404(a)(1) of the Victims of Crime Act of 1984, as amended, providesthat crime victim assistance grants shall be made from the portion of theFund not used for crime victim compensation grants, or reserved for trainingand technical assistance activities, or for financial support to victimsof Federal crime (See section 1404(c)(1) of the Act), or for grants underthe Children's Justice Act (See section 1404 A of the Act). Funds are availablefor expenditures in the Federal fiscal year of award and in the next succeedingfiscal year. Note: The Federal fiscal year begins on October 1 and endson September 30 of the following year. <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Allocation to States </ITAG>Each state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and United States VirginIslands, and any territory and possession shall receive a base amount of$150,000 in fiscal years 1989 through 1991, and a base amount of $200,000thereafter through fiscal year 1994, and that portion of the then remainingavailable money to each state that results from a distribution among thestates on the basis of each state's population in relation to all states.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Allocation of Funds within the States </ITAG>Funds granted to the states are to be further subgranted within the stateto eligible victim services programs. The state has sole discretion asto which programs providing direct services to crime victim receive funds,so long as the eligibility criteria set out in the Act and enumerated inthese Guidelines are met. <ITAG tagnum="81">D. Seed Money </ITAG>OVC encourages states to take into consideration in developing programfunding policy, the range of victim services needed throughout the state,the track record of funded programs, and the extent to which other sourcesof funding are available to proposed projects and previously funded VOCAprojects. States are encouraged to carefully examine their various victimservice needs and to expand into new service areas as crime victims fundsincrease. State administrators are discouraged from establishing a blanketpolicy of terminating funding to programs receiving awards in previousyears solely to fund new programs. III. Program Requirements <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Priority and Previously Underserved Victim Populations </ITAG>Under the Act, the chief executive of the state must certify that the stateshall give priority to eligible crime victim assistance programs whichhave as their principal mission providing direct assistance to victimsof sexual assault, spouse abuse, or child abuse, and to programs servingpreviously underserved populations of victims of violent crime as determinedby each state. (See section 1404(a)(2) (A) and (B) of the Act). To meetthis requirement, each state shall allocate at least 10% of its total Victimsof Crime Act victim assistance grant to each of the three priority categoriesand at least 10% to programs which serve victims determined by the stateto have been previously underserved. Each state is further required to describe in its application or within60 days of acceptance of their award the procedures used to identify previouslyunderserved victim populations and the method planned for allocating VOCAfunding for these services. The 10% figure provided in these Program Guidelinesis intended to represent a base amount of funding to each of the priorityareas and to the underserved victims of crime and to give each state discretionto determine the level of additional funding needed. The Office for Victims of Crime believes it is incumbent upon each state,not the Federal Government, to determine if funding in excess of the minimumbase amount level established by the Office for Victims of Crime is neededin a particular priority area. In no way is the 30% base amount targetedfor programs serving priority victims nor the 10% base amount targetedfor programs serving previously underserved victim populations intendedto establish a cap on the amount allocated to programs serving these categoriesof crime victims. While experience has shown that states have allocatedthe vast majority of VOCA funds to programs which serve victims of childabuse, domestic violence, and sexual assault, states may provide fundingfor all types of victim services.1. <T3>Defining A Priority Program.</T3> OVC defines a priority program asone whose principal mission is to offer comprehensive specialized servicestailored to the special needs of one or more priority category of victims.OVC encourages states to consult with victim service providers, victimadvocates, crime victims, etc., in identifying what those specialized servicesshould be.  2. <T3>Identifying Previously Underserved Populations.</T3> States must makefunds available for services to previously underserved victim populationsand are encouraged to identify previously underserved populations of victimsby type of crime, e.g., victims of DUI and DWI, survivors of homicide victims,and other victims of violent crime, or Native American victims of crimeon Indian reservations. OVC has included Native American victims of crimebecause of the paucity of services on Indian reservations and their lackof access to existing services due to geographic remoteness.  <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Non-Supplanting  </ITAG>The chief executive of the state of his/her designated state administratormust certify that crime victim assistance grant funds will not be usedto supplant state and local funds that would otherwise be available forcrime victim services. (See section 1404(a)(2)(B) of the Act.) Federalgrant funds are intended to enhance or expand services, not substitutefor other sources of support.  <ITAG tagnum="81">C. Eligibility Criteria  </ITAG>States must use crime victim assistance grant funds to support programsthat provide direct services to crime victims. Each individual victim assistanceproject receiving a crime victim assistance subgrant must meet the followingeligibility requirements:  1. Be operated by a public agency or nonprofit organization or a combinationthereof that provides direct services to crime victims;  2. If it is an existing program, have a record of providing effective servicesto victims of crime and financial support from other sources. In determiningwhether or not a program has a ``record of providing effective services,''the state shall consider whether the program has been providing servicesto victims of crime for a minimum of one year, has the support and approvalof its services by the community, and whether or not an analysis of itsactivities and financial history shows that it achieves its intended resultsin a cost-effective manner. An existing program shall be considered tohave ``financial support from other (non-Federal) sources'' if at least20% of its support (including in-kind contributions) is from non-Federalsources, or an appropriation, as provided in Chapter 2, paragraph 14(c)(2)(b)of the M 7100.1. (See section 1404(b)(1)(B)(i) of the Act.)<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note:</T4> Funds subgranted to Indian tribes or Native American organizationson Indian reservations will require only a 5 percent minimum match (cashon in-kind) of the total costs of the VOCA supported victim assistanceprogram or project.</ITAG>3. If it is a new program that has not yet demonstrated a record of effectiveservices as required under (2) above, it may be eligible for funding ifit demonstrates substantial financial support from non-Federal sources.``Substantial financial support'' means that at least thirty-five percent(35%) of its budget is in the form of cash or in-kind contributions fromnon-Federal sources or an appropriation as provided in Chapter 2, paragraph14(c)(2)(b) of the M 7100.1. [See section 1404(b)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act.]<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note:</T4> Funds subgranted to Indian tribes or Native American organizationson Indian reservations will require only a 5 percent minimum match (cashon in-kind) of the total costs of the VOCA supported victim assistanceprogram or project.</ITAG>a. <T3>Overmatch.</T3> In a number of the states' subgrant award reports,the Office for Victims of Crime has noted that subgrantees designated asubstantial portion of all of their non-Federal dollars as match. Statesand subgrantees should be mindful that any funds designated as matchingfunds for Federal dollars are restricted to the same uses outlined in theProgram Guidelines for Federal funds. Therefore, it is suggested that subgranteesonly provide match at the levels required by the Program Guidelines (i.e.,20% for existing programs and 35% for new programs). In that way, thereare no Federal restrictions on the non-Federal dollars not used by subgrantprograms as match.b. <T3>Basis of Match.</T3> The final Program Guidelines will continue torequire match on a project-by-project basis. No exceptions will be grantedto this policy. Programs receiving block funds must maintain records whichclearly show the source, the amont, and the timing of all matching contributions.The M7100.1 also places primary responsibility on the state to ensure subgranteecompliance with this requirement. 4. Utilizes volunteers unless, and to the extent, the state chief executivedetermines complelling reasons exist to waive this requirement. A ``compellingreason'' may include statutory or contractual provisions that bare theuse of volunteers for certain positions or a lack of persons volunterringafter a sustained and aggressive recruitment effort has been conducted. 5. Promotes within the community served coordinaed public and private effortsto aid crime victims. (see section 1404(b)(1)(D) of the Act.) Because ofthe various kinds of services needed by victims of crime, services areusually provided by a variety of agencies. Therefore, it is essential thatthese services be coordinated to ensure continuity of support to the victimand to avoid duplication of effort. In determining whether or not a programmeets this requirement, the state shall consider the extent to which theprogram demonstrates that is will coordinate its activities with otherservice providers in the community, including Federal victim/witness coordinators,so that the best interests of the crime victims are served and interagencycommunication is enhanced.  6. Assists victims in seeking available crime victim compensation benefits.(See section 1404(b)(1)(E) of the Act.) Such assistance may be achievedby identifying and notifying potential recipients of the availability ofcompensation and assisting them with application forms and procedures.An eligible program must demonstrate that it will coordinate its activitieswith the state compensation program, where one exists. d. Section 1404(b)(1) of the Victims of Crime Act of 1984, as amended,provides specific criteria for programs to be eligible for victim assistancegrant funds. The reauthorization and issuance of these Program Guidelinesprovide an opportunity to clarify issues which have emerged regarding theappropriate use of Victim of Crime Act victim assistance grant funds. TheOffice for Victims of Crime is mindful of the fact that we now have hadfour years of experience administering VOCA victim assistance grants. Aftercareful review of the subgrants made in prior fiscal years, the Officefor Victims of Crime believes it is necessary to articulate policy positionsconcerning certain allowable costs and program eligibility. One area of central importance in this discussion is the relationship betweenVOCA crime victim compensation and VOCA victim assistance programs. Intheir initial years of grants, some states used victim assistance grantfunds to supplement crime victim compensation awards to victims of crime.In these cases, some programs receiving VO-CA victim assistance grant fundssupplemented crime victim compensation claims when a particular loss orexpense was not covered by the state crime victim compensation program.This is not an appropriate use of limited VOCA victim assistance funds.It is clear in the legislative history that the crime victim compensationprovision of the Act was intended as the sole source of VOCA funding forreimbursement to victims for out-of-pocket expenses relating to a compensablecrime. VOCA victim assistance grant funds, on the other hand, are intendedto support the provision of direct services to victims of crime. Crime victim assistance funds shall be used only to provide direct servicesto victims of crime. (Section 1404(b)(2).) For purposes of these Guidelines,services to victims of crime means those activities that directly benefitindividual crime victims including the required and necessary coordinationof such activities, i.e., coordination of volunteers and/or coordinationof services to the victim which must be provided by other community agencies.Activities unrelated or only tangentially related to the provision of directservices to victims are not eligible for support. Likewise, indirect costswhich are often imposed by Indian tribes of Federal grants are <T3>not </T3>permissible in VOCA funded victim assistance grants. Questions have also arisen as to whether local legal services corporation-fundedoffices are eligible as victim assistance subgrantees. Legal services,especially legal advocacy services, are not the types of victim servicesenvisioned when the Victims of Crime Act was enacted. The ``court relatedservices'' eligible for VOCA funding include, but are not limited to, assistingvictims with filing temporary restraining orders, explaining court procedures,accompanying a crime victim to court, providing child care services forcrime victims while they participate in essential court proceedings, providingtransportation to and from court, and providing emotional support to crimevictims during a trail. However, a legal services agency is not deemedineligible as long as it provides the emergency services discussed above,e.g., securing temporary restraining orders, etc. Such programs may seekVOCA funding for the above-described emergency services. 1. The following activities are ineligible for VOCA funding.a. <T3>Community Education. </T3>General public awareness campaigns designedto raise the public's consciousness of victims issues do not qualify asdirect services to crime victims and are ineligible for support with VOCAfunds. The community education activities eligible to receive VOCA fundsare limited to efforts describing direct services available and how toobtain a program's assistance, e.g., publication of brochures, pamphlets,etc. b. <T3>Crime Prevention. </T3>Also ineligible for funding are those programsin which crime victims are not the sole or primary beneficiaries of fundedactivities. The crime prevention activities eligible to receive VOCA fundsare limited to those prevention efforts specifically included in providingemergency assistance after a victimization incident such as services toprevent the immediate reburgularization of a home or an apartment, e.g.boarding up of windows, replacement or repair of security locks, etc. Othermore generalized crime prevention efforts are not allowable. c. <T3>Lobbying, Legislative, and Administrative Advocacy. </T3>Lobbying forparticular victim legislation or administrative reform, whether conducteddirectly or indirectly, is another activity that is ineligible for fundingwith VOCA victim assistance grant funds. Chapter 5, paragraph 74, subsection3, of the Office of Justice Programs' <T3>Financial and Administrative Guide for Grants, </T3>M7100.1 [(effectiveedition) hereinafter referred to as M7100.1], lists the following activitesas not allowable: ``Any attempt to influence: (i) The introduction of Federalor state legislation; or (ii) the enactment or modification of any pendingFederal or state legislation through communication with any member or employeeof the Congress or State legislature (including efforts to influence stateor local officials to engage in similar lobbying activity), or with anygovernment official or employee in connection with a decision to sign orveto enrolled legislation.'' Refer to paragraph 74 of M7100.1 for furtherinformation on allowable and unallowable activities. d. <T3>Perpetrator Rehabilitation. </T3>Perpetrator counseling and/or rehabilitationis not a direct service to a victim of crime as intended by VOCA and is,therefore, not an eligible service or activity to be supported by victimassistance grant funds. e. <T3>Needs Assessments, Surveys, Manuals, and Protocols. </T3>The use ofVOCA funds to conduct needs assessments, surveys, develop manuals and protocol,or to perform general administrative tasks does not fall within the intentof the Act and is outside the scope of the Program Guidelines. f. <T3>Fundraising. </T3>Chapter 5, Paragraph 75 of M7100.1 lists fund raisingas an unallowable expense. g. <T3>Equipment Purchases/Capital Expenditures. </T3>Section 1404(b)(2) providesthat Victims of Crime Act victim assistance grant funds may only be usedto provide services to victims of crime. However, equipment that is necessaryand essential to the delivery of direct service is deemed by the Officefor Victims of Crime as an allowable cost. h. <T3>Professional Services of Doctors and Lawyers. </T3>The payment of feesfor professional services rendered by lawyers and doctors in most instancesextend beyond the intent of the Act and are, therefore, ineligible forVOCA victim assistance funding. Except for the purposes of providing reimbursementfor forensic medical examinations, as provided in section III, D(2)(e)of the Act, victims treated for crime related injuries are encouraged toseek reimbursement for medical services rendered by doctors from theirstate crime victims compensation program. This provision, however, doesnot prohibit direct service programs from hiring as staff salaried medical/mentalhealth professionals to provide services on site to clients. This differssignificantly from a case by case fee-for-service type arrangement. OVCconsiders only those legal services that include the filing of elder abusepetitions, child abuse petitions, and temporary restraining orders as allowableactivities to be supported by VOCA victim assistance funds. All other,non-emergency, legal services are not allowable. i. <T3>Witness Management and Notification Programs. </T3>Projects whose primaryobjectives are to improve the prosecutorial efficiency of a prosecutor'soffice and whose goals are primarily witness management and notificationare identified as administrative in nature and are, therefore, ineligiblefor support with Victims of Crime Act victim assistance grant funds. However,victim/witness programs in prosecutors offices, which provide both victimservices such as escort and support during trials and other type of services,can receive VOCA funding support only for that portion of the program thatprovides direct services to crime victims. j. <T3>Criminal Justice Improvements. </T3>General criminal justice agencyimprovements or programs where crime victims are not the sole or primarybeneficiaries are not eligible for support with VOCA vicitim assistancegrant funds. k. <T3>Insurance. </T3>The purchase of liability insurance policies and therepair of buildings and vehicles are incidental expenses and do not appearto be necessary to the provision of direct services to crime victims asintended by the Act. Therefore, VOCA grant funds may not be used for thesepurposes. l. <T3>Rent. </T3>A subgrantee may charge, or prorate, a reasonable cost ofrent for a VOCA-funded project. The grantee/subgrantee shall certify inwriting that the requested rental charge is consistent with the prevailingrate in the local area and shall maintain documentation in its file tosupport such a determination. 2. ``Services to victims of crime'' include, but are not limited to, thefollowing: a. Crisis intervention services that meet the urgent short-term emotionalor physical needs of crime victims. Crisis intervention services programsare encouraged to coordinate the provision of 24 hour services which mayinclude the operation of a crisis hotline that provides emergency counselingor referral for crime victims; b. Emergency services that provide temporary shelter for crime victimswho cannot safely remain in their current lodgings offer measures suchas repair of locks, or boarding-up of windows to prevent the immediatereburglarization of a home or an apartment, or provide crime victims withpetty cash for meeting immediate needs related to transportation, food,shelter, and other necessities; c. Support services that include follow-up counseling following the initialtraumatic event; reassurance, empathetic listening, and guidance for resolvingpractical problems created by the victimization experience; acting on thevictims behalf vis-a-vis other social services and criminal justice agencies;assistance in obtaining the swift return of property being kept by policeas evidence; intervention, as appropriate, with landlords, creditors oremployers; and referral to other sources of assistance, as needed; d. Court-related services that assist crime victims in participating incriminal justice proceedings including transportation to court, child care,escort services and the filing of elder abuse and child abuse petitions,and temporary restraining orders; e. Payment of all reasonable costs for a forensic medical examination ofa crime victim, to the extent that such costs are not otherwise reimbursedor paid by a third party. <ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>Funds may only be used to pay for those forensic medicalexaminations that conform to standards adopted by the state or meet theevidentiary requirements of the local prosecutor. </ITAG>E. The state must establish procedures to assure that funds subgrantedto an eligible crime victim assistance program are expended only for providingservices to victims of crime. These procedures shall require a programto demonstrate to the state that the assistance funds it requested aredirectly related to the delivery of services to crime victims. Any costs,with the exception of audit expenses at the subgrant level, not directlyrelated to service delivery for crime victims must not be charged to asubgrant. Programs that serve both victims and non-victims must reasonablyprorate their costs to assure that crime victims funds are used only forvictim services. IV Application Requirements <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Application Submission. </ITAG>Applications for crime victim assistance grants must be submitted by thechief executive officer or his/her designee. The Office for Victims ofCrime will provide a Program Instruction and Application Kit to each statefor each Federal Fiscal Year. The application kit shall include: SF 424-Applicationfor Federal Assistance, a list of assurances, a table of Fund alocations,certification of a drug-free workplace, certification regarding debarment,and additional guidance on how to prepare and submit an application forcrime victim assistance grants. The Program Instruction and ApplicationKit will serve as the guidance document regarding application submissionand content. <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Application Specificity </ITAG>Applications from the state need not specify the subgrants the state intendsto make with the Federal crime victim assistance funds it receives. However,in the application, states must identify the ``previously underserved''crime victim population to be served in the state with Federal victim assistancegrant funds and discuss how the determination was made. V. Reporting Requirements A report to the President and Congress from OVC on the monies collectedfor the Crime Victims Fund from each source described in Section 1402 andon the effectiveness of the activities supported by the Fund is due onDecember 31, 1990, and on December 31, every two years thereafter. Reporting requirements for this program are designed to provide the Officefor Victims of Crime with meaningful information about the use of VOCAfunds, progress in the delivery of victim services nationwide, and compliancewith VOCA Program Guidelines. Section 1407(b) of the Victims of Crime Act, as amended, requires eachrecipient of Federal victim assistance grant funds to maintain recordsas the Director of the Office for Victims of Crime may prescribe includingrecords that fully disclose the amount and disposition by the recipientof sums, the total cost of the undertaking for which such sums are used,and that portion of the cost of the undertaking supplied by other sources,and any other records that will facilitate an effective audit. Section1407(f) permits the Director to: (1) Terminate payments to a state; 2)suspend payments to a state until the Director is satisfied that noncompliancehas ended; or take other action as appropriate towards any state failingto comply substantially with any provision of the Victims of Crime Actor Program Guidelines requirement. <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Subgrant Award Report </ITAG>The state is required to notify the Office for Victims of Crime withinthirty (30) days of an award of a subgrant, or of a change in an awardto a subgrant recipient, and provide all information required to completea Subgrant Award Report form provided by the Office for Victims of Crime.This information is required on <T3>each </T3>individual project which receives Federal crime victim assistancefunds. If Federal victim assistance grant funds are passed through to anotheragency to further determine the distribution of funds, a Subgrant AwardReport form <T3>must </T3>be completed for each program receiving Federal victim assistancegrant funds. This report provides the Office for Victims of Crime withinformation necessary to determine compliance with the Victims of CrimeAct, Program Guidelines, and provides information necessary to determinethe status of VOCA funded victim services in each state. Each state administratormust notify OVC in their application of the approximate number of SubgrantAward Report forms they will need to meet this program requirement. <ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>OVC will provide the state with blank forms with the notificationof award or at a later date, if not available at that time. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">B. Performance Report </ITAG>The state crime victim assistance agency receiving Federal victim assistancegrant funds under the Victims of Crime Act is required to submit a performancereport 90 days after the end of each anual grant, in the format and onthe form provided by the Office for Victims of Crime. The state administratoris responsible for compiling the information and submitting a report tothe Office for Victims of Crime. The performance report provides informationon the effect the Federal funds have had on services to crime victims inthe state. This report should be submitted to the Office for Victims ofCrime, Office of Justice Programs, 633 Indiana Avenue NW., Washington,DC 20531, by December 30. Note: OVC will provide each state with a copyof the program performance report form with the notification of award,or at a later date, if not avaialble at the time of the award. <ITAG tagnum="81">C. Financial Status Report </ITAG>A Financial Status Report (Form H-1) is required for all grants. This reportshall be submitted by the Grantee within 45 days after the end of eachcalendar quarter. Final reports are due 90 days after the end of the grant.Failure to comply with this requirement may result in administrative actionsuch as the withholding of payments, cancellation of a Letter of Credit,or noncertification of new grant awards. In lieu of using the H-1, granteesmay satisfy the financial reporting requirements by completing the H-1turnaround document. This document is a facsimile of the H-1 extractedfrom the grantor agency's computer files and sent directly to each grantee.Pertinent information such as grantee name, address, grant number, andthe previously submitted financial information (if any) is printed on theform by the computer. <ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>Obligation and expenditure Data must be reported at theSubgrantee Level. </ITAG>VI. Financial Requirements <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Payment of Grant Funds </ITAG>1. <T3>Annual Requirement Under $120,000. </T3>Grantees whose annual fundrequirement is less than $120,000 will receive Federal funds on a ``CheckIssued'' basis. Upon receipt, review and approval of a Request for Advanceor Reimbursement, H-3 Report (OJP, Form 7160/3) by the grantor agency,a voucher, and a schedule for payment is prepared for the amount approved.This schedule is forwarded to the U.S. Treasury requesting issuance andmailing of the check directly to the grantee or its designated fiscal agent.A request must be limited to the grantee's immediate cash needs and submittedat least monthly. 2. <T3>Annual Requirement Over $120,000. </T3>Grantees whose annual fund requirementexceeds $120,000 generally receive Federal funds by utilizing the ``Letterof Credit'' procedures. This funding method is a cash management processprescribed by the U.S. Treasury for all major grant-in-aid recipients.3. <T3>Check Issuance. </T3>All checks drawn for the payment of fund requests,either under the ``Check Issued'' or the ``Letter of Credit'' process,are prepared and disbursed by the U.S. Treasury and <T3>not </T3>by the grantor agency. 4. <T3>Termination of Advance Funding. </T3>If a grantee organization receivingcash advances by letter of credit or by direct Treasury check demonstratesan unwillingness or inability to establish procedures that will minimizethe time elapsing between cash advances and disbursement, the grantor agencymay terminate advance funding and require the grantee organization to financeits operations with its own working capital. Payments to grantee will thenbe made by the direct Treasury check method to reimburse the grantee foractual cash disbursements. It is essential that the grantee organizationmaintain a minimal amount of cash on hand and that drawdowns of cash aremade only when necessary for disbursements. <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Cost Allowability </ITAG>The Victims of Crime Act of 1984, as amended, specifically states thatcrime victim assistasnce grant funds may be used only for providing directservices to victims of crime. Only those costs directly related and essentialto providing direct services to crime victims can be charged to the VOCA-fundedsubgrant. The following items require specific discussion. For furtherguidance, see Office of Justice Programs' <T3>Financial and Administrative Guide for Grants, </T3>M7100.1, Chapter5. 1. <T3>Audit costs: </T3>Although under OMB Circular A-128 audit costs aregenerally allowable charges under Federal grants, audit costs incurredat the grantee (state) level are determined to be an administrative expenseand, therefore, <T3>cannot </T3>be paid for with crime victim assiatance grant funds. Reasonableaudit costs incurred at the subgrantee level are, however, considered directlyrelated and essential to the operation of the program and may be reimbursedas allowable costs. 2. <T3>Training: </T3>An eligible subgrantee of crime victim assistance grantfunds may only include as a budget item the reasonable cost of staff developmentfor those persons (salaried and volunteer staff) who provide direct servicesto crime victims. Also included as an allowable cost are the necessaryand reasonable travel expenses related to the participation of direct servicestaff in eligible training programs. Such costs are, however, permittedonly within the state or a comparable geographic region; 3. <T3>Printing and Postage: </T3>An eligible subgrantee of crime victim assistancegrant funds may include as a budget item reasonable costs of printing anddistributing brochures and similar announcements to describe their program'svictim services and how to obtain these services. 4. <T3>Examples of Ineligible Costs include but are not limited to: </T3>Theadministrative costs associated with conducting surveys and needs assessments,developing manuals and protocols, fees for professional services renderedby doctors and lawyers, and those costs associated with fundraising activities.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Audit Responsibilities </ITAG>Pursuant to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-128, ``Auditsof State and Local Governments,'' grantees, subgrantees, and subrecipientshave the responsibility to provide for an audit of their activities. Theseaudits shall be made annually, unless the state or local government has,by January 1, 1987, a constitutional or statutory requirement for lessfrequent audits. Note: Institutions of higher education, hospitals, andother nonprofit organizations have the responsibility to provide for anaudit of their activities not less than every two years. While governments(state and local) receiving less than $25,000 in any fiscal year are exemptfrom a single audit, there is no audit exclusion for private nonprofitorganizations. However, where state and local governments and nonprofitorganizations received grants or other agreements less than $100,000 anddo not obtain audits that meet the requirements of OMB Circulars A-110and A-128, DOJ grantor organizations shall ensure that Federal funds arespent in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Techniques touse to determine recipient compliance with Federal requirements are: 1. Recipient obtained audits made in accordance with the Standards forAudit of Governmental Organizations, Programs, Activities, and Functionsissued by the Comptroller General; 2. Previous audits performed on recipients' operations; 3. Desk reviews by program officials of project documentation; 4. Project audits by Federal auditors or auditors obtained by recipients;5. Evaluations of recipients' operations by program officials. These audits shall be made by an independent auditor in accordance withgenerally accepted government auditing standards governing financial andcompliance audits. The required audits are to be performed on an organization-widebasis as opposed to a grant-by-grant basis. The audit reports must include:1. The auditor's report on financial statements of the recipient organizationand a schedule of financial assistance showing the total expenditure foreach Federal assistance program; 2. The auditor's report on compliance containing: a. A statement of positive assurance with respect to those items testedfor compliance, including compliance with law and regulations pertainingto financial reports and claims for advances and reimbursements; b. A negative assurance of those items not tested and a summary of allinstances of noncompliance; and c. The auditor's report on the study and evaluation of internal controlsystems, which must identify the organization's significant internal accountingcontrols designed to provide reasonable assurance that Federal programsare being managed in compliance with applicable laws and regulation. Itmust also identify the controls that were evaluated, the controls thatwere not evaluated, and the material weaknesses identified as a resultof that evaluation. <ITAG tagnum="81">D. Audit Objectives </ITAG>Grants and other agreements are awarded subject to conditions of fiscal,program and general administration to which the recipient expressly agrees.Accordingly, the audit objective is to review the recipient's administrationof grant funds and required non-Federal contributions for the purpose ofdetermining whether the recipient has: 1. Financial statements of the government, department, agency, or establishmentthat present fairly its financial position and the results of its financialoperations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;2. The organization has internal accounting and other control systems toprovide reasonable assurance that it is managing Federal financial assistanceprograms in compliance with applicable laws and regulation; and 3. The organization has complied with laws and regulations that may havematerial effect on its financial statements and on each Federal assistanceprogram. <ITAG tagnum="81">E. Audit Implementation </ITAG>Grantees are required to specify their arrangement for complying with theprovisions of OMB Circular A-128 and include in their grant application,to the extent possible, the following information: 1. The identity of the organization that will conduct the audit; 2. Approximate timing of when the audit will be performed; 3. Audit coverage to be provided. Where the audit will not provide thecoverage requirements as specified previously, the audit policy or proceduresmust describe the specific arrangements for obtaining audit services thatwill meet the requirements; 4. An identification of the audit standards, if any, with which the granteewill not comply; 5. Receipt and appropriate distribution of the resultant audit report;and 6. Audit resolution policies and procedures to be followed in resolvingthe audit report. <ITAG tagnum="81">F. Fund Suspension or Termination </ITAG>If, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, the Office for Victimsof Crime, Office of Justice Programs finds that a state has failed to substantiallycomply with the Victims of Crime Act, M7100.1, these proposed implementingGuidelines, or any implementing regulation, the Office for Victims of Crime,Office of Justice Programs may suspend or terminate funding to the state,or take other appropriate action. Only states may request a hearing; Subgranteesin the state may not. VII. Additional Requirements <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Civil Rights </ITAG>1. <T3>General.</T3> The Act provides that no person shall be excluded fromparticipation in, denied the benefits of, subjected to discrimination under,or denied employment in connection with any activity receiving funds underthe Act on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, handicap,or sex. (See section 1407(e) of the Act.) Recipients of funds under theAct are also subject to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.2000d (prohibiting discrimination in federally-funded programs on the basisof race, color, or national origin), section 504 of the RehabilitationAct of 1973, 2 U.S.C. 794 (prohibiting discrimination in such programson the basis of handicap), the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, 42 U.S.C.6101, <T3>et seq</T3>., and the Department of Justice Nondiscrimination Regulations,28 CFR Part 42, Subparts, C, D, and G. 2. <T3>Required Assurances and Information.</T3> To be eligible for fundingunder the Act, a crime victim assistance program must submit the followingassurances and information: a. An assurance that the program will comply with all applicable nondiscriminationrequirements; b. An assurance that in the event a Federal or state court or Federal orstate administrative agency makes a finding of discrimination after a dueprocess hearing, on the grounds of race, color, religion, national origin,sex, age or handicap aganist the program, the program will forward a copyof the finding to the Office of Justice Programs, Office for Civil Rights(OCR); c. The name of the civil rights contact person who has lead responsibilityin ensuring that all applicable civil rights requirements are met and whoshall act as liaison in civil rights matters with OCR; d. An assurance that programs will maintain information on victim servicesprovided by race, national origin, sex, age and handicap. Note: Statesare not required to submit this information as part of their program performancereport. <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Confidentiality of Research Information </ITAG>No recipient of monies under the Victims of Crime Act of 1984, as amended,shall use or reveal any research or statistical information furnished underthis program by any person and identifiable to any specific private personfor any purpose other than the purpose for which such information was obtainedin accordance with this program and Act. Such information shall be immunefrom legal process and shall not, without the consent of the person furnishingsuch information, be admitted as evidence or used for any purpose in anyaction, suit, or other judicial, legislative, or administrative proceeding.(See section 1407(d) of the Act.) This provision is intended, among otherthings, to assure the confidentiality of information provided by crimevictims to crisis intervention counselors working for victim services programsreceiving funds provided under this Act. Whatever the scope of applicationgiven this provision, it is clear that there is nothing in the Act or itslegislative history to indicate that Congress instended to override orrepeal, in effect, a state's existing law governing the disclosure of informationwhich is supportive of the Act's fundamental goal of helping crime victims.For example, this provision would not act to override or repeal, in effect,a state's existing law pertaining to the mandatory reporting of suspectedchild abuse.
