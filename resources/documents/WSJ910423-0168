Subscribers and legislators would be won over byimproved customer service, investors would once again fall inlove with cable stocks, and cable deals would start hummingagain.   So far, those predictions have been wrong on all counts.Despite a robust basic business that seems to be almostrecession-proof, new storm clouds loom over the $20 billioncable-television industry. As cable operators and programmersgather for their annual convention in New Orleans thisweekend, another crop of regulatory proposals is sprouting inCongress. The Federal Communications Commission is ponderinga new set of rules that would let cities regulate cablerates, and telephone companies and others press on withefforts to enter cable's market.</LP><TEXT>   Even more worrisome, after piling on debt for aggressiveexpansion in the 1980s, the cable industry now faces a creditcrunch. Billions of dollars in cable loans are classifiedwith the scarlet letters HLT -- for Highly LeveragedTransactions. As banks scurry to reduce their exposure tosuch loans in the face of strict federal banking regulations,cable companies are finding it virtually impossible to borrowadditional funds for acquisitions and much-needed capitalexpenditures.   Credit may get even tighter; new guidelines put the HLTbrand on cable companies even if their parent companies oraffiliates are the ones with high debt. The squeeze has allbut killed the once-robust cable deal market, where systemssold for as much as $3,000 per subscriber less than two yearsago. In the only major recent transaction, Providence JournalCo. acquired cable systems and TV stations from KingBroadcasting Co. But it paid only about $1,500 per cablesubscriber -- and it used cash from the sale of other assets.   Yet for all the bad news, cable operators continue toreport strong growth in their basic business. Consumers arestaying home more, and cable, at less than $20 a month formost basic-service packages, still looks like a bargain. Onlyabout 50 million homes of the 82 million passed by cable'swires actually buy the service, and while the industry isclearly maturing, cable operators continue to add newsubscribers at a respectable rate each year. &quot;The businessitself just hums along,&quot; says Brian Roberts, president ofcable giant Comcast Corp.   &quot;The paradox of cable is that the basic business iswonderful, but everything else has taken a turn for theworse,&quot; says Steven Rattner, a media specialist at investmentbanker Lazard Freres andamp; Co. Adds Gerald Hassel, who overseescable and media lending at Bank of New York, &quot;Cable's basicbusiness is fundamentally pretty damn sound, but there iszero funding available for transactions.&quot;   Cable stocks have rallied recently, but most remain farfrom their high-water mark. In the 1980s, investors embracedcable stocks, ready to overlook the fact that none of themajor companies reported profits for years. But investors arenow just as jittery as banks over high debt and no earnings.   Cable's critics say the industry is sometimes its ownworst enemy. After winning a stunning victory with the CableAct of 1984, which deregulated the industry and freed it toraise rates, cable operators drew the ire of many influentiallegislators by jacking up prices and offering consumers fewerprogramming choices for the basic cable fee. And while anumber of cable operators adopted new customer-servicestandards drawn up by the National Cable TelevisionAssociation, such practices aren't yet &quot;uniform,&quot;acknowledges James Mooney, the NCTA's president.   But Mr. Mooney and other cable executives say criticsoverlook the array of programming choices and the newadvances in technology that promise more whiz-bang options toconsumers. They point to such coups as Cable News Network'scoverage of the Mideast war, which drew viewers andadvertisers. &quot;What has not been fully appreciated is thedegree to which we have made great strides in programming,&quot;Mr. Mooney says.   Advertisers, at least, are impressed. Spending on cablenetwork advertising, a mere $58 million a decade ago, hitmore than $2.5 billion last year despite the recession and acutback in ad spending nationwide. Counter to the rest of themedia business, cable networks are all enjoying double-digitincreases in ad revenues. Frank Biondi, chief executive ofViacom Inc., says his company's cable networks, which includeMTV, VH-1, and Nickelodeon, are exceeding their ad-revenueprojections for the first quarter and first half.   Cable operators say they are investing far more money inprogramming than in past years. And unlike broadcastnetworks, which pay their affiliates to carry networkprograms, cable networks charge operators on a per-subscriberbasis -- and those fees have been rising steadily. Oneoperator told a Senate hearing that while cable rates in hissystems had gone up 38.9% since 1986, programming expenses inthe same period had risen more than 176%.   After years of study, cable operators are moving forwardwith plans for new fiber-optic technology that could giveconsumers hundreds of new channels. Time Warner Inc. recentlyannounced plans to use the technology in its new cable systemin Queens to offer 150 channels even before &quot;compression&quot;techniques that could expand the offering to 600 channels.   And while cable operators were quaking last year at thethreat of competition from high-powered direct-broadcastingsatellite services, that threat has quickly receded. Thethree media giants who announced plans for the most ambitiousof the DBS services -- News Corp., Cablevision Systems Inc.,and General Electric Co.'s National Broadcasting Co. unit --have all backed off. Hughes Communications Inc., which was tolaunch the satellite for the venture, is seeking newpartners.   Also on the plus side for the industry is the continuingopposition of the Bush administration to cable legislation.Indeed, the consensus among many in Washington is that theissue is a low priority among the majority of congressmennow.   Still, a half dozen bills to re-regulate cable have beenintroduced in both the House and the Senate. (Most of theattention at some cable hearings on Capitol Hill last week,though, was centered on actress Jane Fonda, who accompaniedwitness Ted Turner.) The bills include provisions that wouldallow the FCC to regulate rates for basic cable service anddetermine if rates for other &quot;premium&quot; services areunreasonable or abusive.   Meanwhile, the FCC is proposing changes to its &quot;effectivecompetition&quot; rules, which now state that such competitionexists if at least three unduplicated television signals areavailable to all television homes in a cable market.Currently, only 5% of cable operators don't meet that testand are thus subject to rate regulation by local authorities.Under proposed new rules, the effective-competition testwould be considerably stricter and could end up subjecting95% of cable operators to rate regulation again by localauthorities.   Partly in anticipation of new rules, some cable operatorshave started to realign their service packages, offering new&quot;economy basic.&quot; But such packages, while often considerablecheaper than a basic cable package, include far lessprogramming. At Suburban Cablevision in East Orange, N.J.,for example, subscribers who now pay $18.95 monthly for basicservice are being offered a $12 economy package. Missing fromthe economy package are 21 program services -- including suchpopular offerings as CNN, MTV and ESPN.   Cable operators say they remain optimistic. Lobbyingefforts aimed at exempting cable operators from some of themore onerous banking restrictions continue, and somecompanies have begun to refinance their existing debt.Comcast, for example, recently completed a $485 millionrefinancing package and sold new equity.   Like other cable giants, Comcast continues to invest inexpansion. Earlier this month, for example, the company added20,000 subscribers in three days in a marketing blitz thatoffered same-day installation. &quot;We still have flaws, but atthe end of the day we have more customers than the monthbefore,&quot; says Mr. Roberts, the company president. &quot;I don'tknow how many products have that kind of success in theseeconomic times.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
