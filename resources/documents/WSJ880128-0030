The agency said it needs the extra time to refit its rocket booster with a replacement for a part that failed during tests. Earlier this month, NASA estimated that the launch would be delayed six to 10 weeks from the June launch date previously scheduled.    The space agency said it plans to test fire the rocket boosters three times before launching the Discovery shuttle. As part of the tests, NASA said, it will deliberately weaken crucial parts to see how well they perform under stress.    NASA also said that it has discovered problems with a weld in the rocket booster but that it doesn't consider the problem significant. </TEXT></DOC>
