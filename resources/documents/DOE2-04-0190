Inthis analysis attention is predominantly directed to the judgement ofthe various sites with emphasis of the location Moerdijk. The analysisof the judgement process of the Government is explicitly based on theinformation given in the policy-plan itself, thus without adding otherstandards, criteria and location sites. 10 refs.; 3 figs.; tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
