Groundbreaking ceremonies were held over the weekend for the Down East Peat Project, a 22,800-kilowatt, peat-fired electric power plant that is, according to its sponsors, the first such commercial plant in North America.    The project is expected to cost about $51 million. Sales over the first five years of operation will be about $66.8 million, the operators said.    Peat, partly decayed plant matter found in ancient bogs and swamps, has long been used as a fuel in Ireland and some other European nations.    Using techniques developed in Ireland, the operators of the Down East project will extract blocks of sod from Deblois's Denbo Heath, dry them and use them as fuel.    The project, scheduled for completion by the end of 1988, is expected to produce enough electricity to serve about 15,000 residential and commercial customers of Boston Edison Co., which will purchase the plant's electrical supply.    The project was developed through a partnership of Bangor, Maine-based Peat Products of America Inc., ACEC of Belgium and Transco Energy Ventures Co., a unit of Transco Energy Co. in Houston. </TEXT></DOC>
