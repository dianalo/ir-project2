In a stern letter delivered yesterday to Rep. Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) and trade subcommittee chairman Sam Gibbons (D., Fla.), Mr. Yeutter specified several provisions the administration opposed. He implied that lawmakers must change the bill in order to avoid a presidential veto.    The letter came as something of a surprise, since Mr. Yeutter initially had reacted with &quot;cautious optimism&quot; to Rep. Rostenkowski's recent efforts to produce a moderate, compromise trade bill. Lawmakers said the trade representative's change to a hard-line tone suggests that the administration itself is divided over the legislation.    Among the provisions Mr. Yeutter criticized was one substantially expanding federal efforts to provide retraining for workers displaced by imports. The president has proposed some increased worker retraining, but his proposals wouldn't be as extensive or automatic as those that would be provided by the committee bill.    The trade representative also objected to a provision in the Rostenkowski bill that would make violations in foreign countries of workers' rights -- such as freedom to associate -- an unfair trade practice and could provoke U.S. trade retaliation.    Mr. Yeutter also criticized several provisions that would limit the president's flexibility in dealing with trade problems. While Rep. Rostenkowski had proposed giving the president much more discretion than earlier House versions of the trade bill, Mr. Yeutter attacked remaining provisions requiring the president to retaliate against certain unfair trade practices by foreign countries.    The trade representative warned that if those provisions aren't eliminated or substantially changed, &quot;I would find it exceedingly difficult to recommend that the president sign any trade bill including them,&quot; Mr. Yeutter stated in the letter.    Even congressional Republicans were disturbed by the tone of the trade representative's letter. &quot;We think Rostenkowski has made a heroic effort at a bipartisan bill, but apparently some in the White House don't want even a bipartisan bill,&quot; said one Republican. &quot;The administration isn't at all unified on trade legislation.&quot;    Mr. Yeutter laid out five tests by which the administration was judging whether to support the various trade proposals. They include looking at whether a proposal &quot;improves American competitiveness&quot; and whether it would likely &quot;provoke retaliation against U.S. exports.&quot; He also suggested that the administration would object to a provision if &quot;enactment of mirror legislation abroad (would) be harmful to U.S. exports.&quot;    The trade representative criticized a provision requiring U.S. trade negotiations, or retaliation, against countries with huge trade surpluses with the U.S. -- even though Rep. Rostenkowski watered down the provision substantially from the original version proposed by Rep. Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.).    &quot;Our fundamental objection is that the proposals still contemplate a balancing of bilateral trade through trade policy actions rather than addressing the problem of large external balances through macroeconomic policies,&quot; Mr. Yeutter wrote.    Meanwhile, Congress and the Reagan administration appeared to be moving in tandem to ease restrictions on the export of high-technology goods with potential military applications. The House Foreign Affairs subcommittee approved such a bill, and the White House submitted a similar, though more modest, proposal.    Lawmakers anticipated that differences between the various proposals can be reconciled. The provisions ultimately will be incorporated in the trade legislation moving through the Ways and Means panel.    Rep. Don Bonker (D. Wash.), chairman of the subcommittee on international economic policy, said there is &quot;strong bipartisan support&quot; for the high-technology trade package, which was designed to meet numerous complaints from U.S. companies. The bill &quot;reflects new realism and political momentum in the House towards a more rational export-control regime,&quot; he added.    Among other provisions, the bill would eliminate, with only a few exceptions, licensing requirements for those so-called dual-use technology products bound for European allies and Japan. It also would allow world-wide export -- including to the Soviet bloc -- of many kinds of commonly available personal computers and electronics goods.    Another provision would do away with requirements that foreign companies obtain permits before they export to third countries products containing U.S.-made parts -- provided those parts don't exceed 35% of the value of the final products.    The subcommittee's bill also reduces the authority of the Pentagon to block export licenses for exports to the non-Communist world, and it would authorize industry representation in international export-control negotiations. Those provisions are likely to spark protests from Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger. But the Pentagon has been gradually losing ground in bureaucratic disputes over who should regulate this sensitive trade.    The House bill reaffirms the intent of earlier legislation to make the Commerce Department the primary regulator for dual-use exports.    Elimination of licensing for most of the high-technology trade with allied countries would speed up paperwork required for such exports, which account for more than half of the U.S. high-technology trade. The bill would require licensing only if the purchaser of such U.S. goods is of a &quot;suspicious&quot; character, if the country receiving the goods has a record of noncompliance with U.S. export regulations, or if the products are &quot;extraordinarily sophisticated.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
