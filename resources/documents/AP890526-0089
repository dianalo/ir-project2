Teachers, students and administrators expressed joy and relieftoday at the return to regular classes.   ``I feel just fine because everything is back to normal now,''said smiling 10th-grader Brenda Montoya as she headed to class atBelmont High. ``We have our teachers back and now we can get backto our studies.''   Principal Marta Lavat Vin told students gathered for an assemblythat it was time for them to get back to their studies.   ``I said I didn't want to see anyone leaving school withouttheir books today, I told them if they were heading out of thebuilding and didn't have their books, they'd better have a goodexcuse.''   The teachers approved a pact Thursday that increases pay by 24percent over three years, gives them greater curricula control, andreduces outside classroom duties such as yard supervision.   ``Things in the Los Angeles Unified School District, as far asteachers are concerned, have changed for all time,'' proclaimedUnited Teachers-Los Angeles President Wayne Johnson before theagremeement was approved by the union's members in a voice vote atthe Sports Arena.   Teachers lost on the issue of recovering pay that had beendocked because of job actions that preceded their May 15 walkout.Many teachers had refused to patrol school yards or work on gradingafter school.   Board members also approved the pact, reached by negotiators at1 a.m. Thursday.   ``I look forward to healing, not only on the board but in thedistrict as a whole,'' said board President Roberta Weintraub.   One board member, Rita Walters, criticized the $600 millionsalary plan as a drain on other parts of the budget.   ``There is money being taken away from the children by thedistrict, from other workers in our district in order to supportthe teacher raise. I think that's unconscionable,'' she said.   The teachers carved out a site-management program under whichthey share power with parents and administrators in overseeingcurriculum and discipline.   The union represents 22,000 of the Los Angeles Unified SchoolDistrict's 32,000 teachers, counselors and librarians.   Salaries under a contract that expired in July 1988 rangebetween $23,440 and $43,319 a year, depending on experience andeducation. The pact raises salaries in the first year to between$25,316 and $46,594 and at the end of three years to between$29,529 and $53,938.   Teachers will receive a retroactive pay raise for the pastschool year, during which they worked without a contract.   The district, the second largest in the nation after New York,brought in substitutes when teachers walked out. But attendanceplummeted and classes became mostly baby-sitting sessions.</TEXT></DOC>
