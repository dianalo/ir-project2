Hitachi's DP-200 model goes on sale today in Japan for1.35 million yen ($10,700). That price is nearly half that ofits cheapest competition, a $19,000 model made by PictureTelCorp. of Peabody, Mass., and one-sixth the price of Hitachi'sprevious model launched in October. In the U.S., whereHitachi will also start taking orders for its machine today,higher distribution costs will raise the price slightly.</LP><TEXT>   Analysts and others in the industry said they weresurprised by the extent to which Hitachi was slashing theprice of the new machine. &quot;The pricing is quiterevolutionary,&quot; said Takahiro Ozawa, a director who analyzesthe communications industry for Infocom Research, aTokyo-based think tank. But although the affordable priceopens up possibilities for companies holding meetings withnew employees in overseas branches, Mr. Ozawa said, thequality of the images must be improved further for themachine to catch on in Japan.   Hitachi's new model &quot;must be keeping its functions to aminimum,&quot; said a spokesman for Sony Corp., a major player inJapan's video conference market. Companies such as Sony,which sell video conference systems costing about $56,000 to$64,000, are trying to cut costs to about $40,000. Hitachi'slow-cost machine, the Sony spokesman said, &quot;must be somethingof a different nature.&quot;   Hitachi officials said the DP-200 is the first model topackage the video coder/decoder, camera and an 11-inch-screenmonitor all into one unit. The compact machine weighs only 35pounds, a company official said, so that &quot;you can carry itanywhere in the office.&quot; PictureTel's model, on the otherhand, has the electronics packaged in a desk-side box inaddition to the monitor, and is bigger than the Hitachimodel, Hitachi officials said.   The DP-200 uses ISDN circuits, or fiber-optic cables usedfor broadband media, with transmission speed between 64,000and 128,000 bits of information per second.   Hitachi, which will start shipping the product in Japanand in the U.S. in April, aims to sell 2,000 units in eachcountry by March 31, 1993, officials said. The company alsolaunched a compact modular version of the system that can behooked up to a television set, costing 1.2 million yen.   To be sure, the machine has its limits. While normaltelevision screens transmit 30 video frames per second,Hitachi's machine can only transmit up to 15 video frames,with the images blurring at top speed. Emphasis on creating aclearer image at lower speeds, on the other hand, makes themovements jerky, causing one reporter to comment that he feltrather &quot;seasick&quot; during Hitachi's display of the product.There is also a time lag between image and voice on thescreen.   Still, Hitachi officials are hopeful that the lower pricewill boost demand for office video conference systems, whichnow have annual sales in Japan of five billion yen.</TEXT></DOC>
