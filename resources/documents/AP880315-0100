ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democrat Jesse Jackson said today ``we're goingto have a good day,'' casting his ballot as the Illinoispresidential primary began with a light turnout in cold weather. Onthe Republican side, George Bush wondered aloud what was keepingrival Bob Dole in the race.   ``I'm not sure I understand what he's doing,'' said Bush duringa final campaign swing in the state where polls were forecasting alandslide victory for the vice president over his GOP rivals.   But both Dole and Pat Robertson were insisting they were stayingin the race, though the former television evangelist said he wouldre-evaluate his status if he gets less than 5 percent of the vote.   Jackson voted at Bryn Mawr Community Church on the city's SouthSide.   ``We've been winning all the way and we'll keep winning,'' saidJackson, the victor last Saturday in South Carolina and winner offive states on Super Tuesday.   The state's other Democratic favorite son, Sen. Paul Simon,voted at the Makanda Fire Station in rural southern Illinois.   After casting their ballots, Simon and his wife went to theirhome and planted a tree in their yard, an election-day tradition.   Between 2.5 million and 3 million voters were expected to turnout for the primary on a wintry day. Kel Hudson, associate directorof the state Board of Elections, said that would represent 46percent to 48 percent of the registered voters.   Illinois does not have party registration so voters could choosea Democratic or Republican ballot at their polling place.   Initial reports from Chicago precincts were of a light turnout.   Precinct captain William Smar said that during the first hourand a half his polling place was open, only 15 of the 498registered voters had cast ballots, nearly all of them Democrats.   ``It's more quiet than normal for this type of election,'' saidThomas Leach, spokesman for the city election commission.   Illinois voters express their presidential preference in anon-binding beauty contest and also elect convention delegates. Itwas possible a candidate would do well in the popular vote, butlose out in the contest for delegates to a contender who hadstronger slates filed in the state's 22 congressional districts.   As if to emphasize his determination to fight on, Dole flew toWisconsin and Connecticut to campaign in two of the states thatfollow Illinois.   Simon said, ``I will win'' his home state's Democratic primary,and conceded second place in either the popular vote or thedelegate contest would not be good enough.   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis said he has made``significant gains'' in his effort to finish ahead of at least oneof the state's two favorite-son candidates.   An ABC News-Washington Post poll done Saturday and Sundaysuggested Simon had the support of 39 percent of 328 likelyDemocratic voters, with Jackson at 34 percent. Simon's lead waswithin the poll's 6-point margin of error. Dukakis trailed with 17percent.   At stake in today's voting were 82 Republican and 113 Democraticdelegates. Another 10 GOP delegates will be chosen at the partystate convention in June. Sixty additional Democratic delegateswill be allocated to candidates in the same proportion as they wondelegates in the primary and 15 more elected and party officialswill become super delegates to the Democratic convention.   The latest Associated Press delegate count gave Bush 705, Dole165 and Robertson 17 GOP convention delegates, out of the 1,139needed for the nomination. On the Democratic side, Dukakis had462.5, Jackson 423.55, Gore 352.8, Gephardt 145 and Simon 35.5.There are 275.65 uncommitted Democratic delegates.   Democratic Chairman Paul Kirk suggested Monday he would try torally uncommitted delegates behind whichever candidate leads thefield when the primaries have ended, if none has yet secured anumerical lock on the nomination.   Kirk said Monday that the party leaders and other officials whoautomatically hold seats as national convention delegates have a``special responsibility'' to help ensure that the nominatingprocess does not turn into a political fight that damages thenominee.   Bush, in the aftermath of his Super Tuesday sweep of 16primaries, saw Illinois as a chance to take another giant steptoward clinching the GOP nomination. Dole hoped the return to theMidwest would blunt the vice president's momentum.   Jackson saw his home state primary as an opportunity tochallenge Dukakis for the leadership of the Democratic field. ForSimon, Illinois was a fight for survival, while Sen. Albert GoreJr. of Tennessee was looking for ``an opportunity to punchthrough'' with a victory in a Northern industrial state.   Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri did little campaigning inIllinois, concentrating instead on Michigan, which holds Democraticcaucuses on March 26.   A poll published Sunday in the Chicago Tribune gave Bush a34-point lead over Dole among Illinois Republicans, with Robertsona distant third.   Yet, the Kansas senator insisted he had no plans to evenconsider dropping out if he does poorly in Illinois.   ``I've made a judgment that Illinois, whatever happens, we'regoing to keep going,'' Dole said at a news conference on Monday.   But he conceded candidates sometimes fail to understand when itis time to get out.   ``Now if you're out there and you've been twisting in the windfor six or eight months and you're starting to smell a little,somebody has to cut the rope,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
