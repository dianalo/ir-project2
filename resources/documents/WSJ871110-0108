The transportation and industrial holding concern reported third-quarter operating profit of 159.7 million Canadian dollars ($121 million), or 53 cents a share, compared with 51.4 million dollars, or 17 cents a share.    In the latest quarter, a gain of 160.8 million dollars on the previously reported sale of the Maple Leaf Mills Ltd. unit made net income 320.5 million dollars, or 1.07 dollars a share. In last year's third quarter, a gain of 28.9 million dollars made profit 81.2 million dollars, or 27 cents a share.    Revenue declined 23% to 3.03 billion dollars from 3.91 billion.    The company said that profit at its CP Rail unit increased in the quarter because of higher freight traffic, although at a slower rate than earlier in the year. A five-day national rail strike disrupted shipments in the latest quarter.    Profits from the company's forest product units surged because of higher prices and increased shipments, and profits at its Pan-Canadian Petroleum Ltd. unit also improved. Improvements were also noted in Canadian Pacific's steel, real estate and shipping businesses.    For the first nine months, operating profit increased more than sevenfold to 437.5 million dollars, or 1.46 dollars a share, from 58.5 million dollars, or 20 cents a share. In the latest nine-month period, special gains totaling 354.1 million dollars made net income 791.7 million dollars, or 2.64 dollars a share. A year ago, charges of 332.6 million dollars from the write-down of assets resulted in a net loss of 274.1 million dollars.    Revenue in the nine months fell 21% to 9.02 billion dollars from 11.44 billion dollars. </TEXT></DOC>
