The state of siegerestricts transit, the freedom of expression, rights of assemblyand privacy of correspondence.   ``You must heed the call to not go out in the streets, to stayin your houses or where you are right now. It's just a question ofa short time,'' Cristiani said.   His Cabinet approved the measure and the legislative assemblywill vote on it Monday, the president said.   ``The terrorists must know that there are judicial tools tofight these irrational attacks.''   The armed forces press office said 26 soldiers had been killedand 65 wounded. Guerrilla deaths totaled 93 and 55 were wounded, itsaid. Rebels gave no figures on their own casualties.   The armed forces said eight civilians were killed and 35 wounded.

A doctor at Hospital Rosales, one of the largest in the capitalof San Salvador, told The Associated Press by telephone that 156civilians wounded by weapons and explosives had been admitted tothat hospital.   The attacks came three days after the Farabundo Marti LiberationFront vowed to intensify the insurgency, in which more than 70,000people, mostly civilians, have been killed in a decade of fighting.   In a broadcast over their clandestine Radio Venceremos, theguerrillas said the San Salvador attacks were part of a nationaloffensive called ``Remove the fascists, Febe Elizabeth lives.''   Febe Elizabeth Velazquez was a union leader who perished in anOct. 31 explosion at the National Federation of Salvadoran Workers.The rebels claim the U.S.-backed government was behind that attackthat killed 10 people and wounded more than 30.   ``Today we are fighting against misery, against those who stayin power through savagery aimed at churches, universities,opposition political parties, guilds, unions and dissidentsectors,'' the rebel broadcast said.   Government troops and a tank entered El Salvador NationalUniversity Sunday and damaged some buildings when they opened fire,a photographer said.   Twelve students and workers were detained and taken by truck toa military base, according to the photographer. He said theprisoners were accused of harboring guerrillas.   A guerrilla leader who identified himself as Commander Fernandeztold reporters Sunday, ``Here we will die fighting. They won'tremove us from here.''   At a news conference at a home in the northern part of thecapital, the guerrilla leader said, ``This is the start of thecounteroffensive. We won't leave until the government gives up orcalls us to the negotiating table.''   Civilian sources contacted by telephone reported fighting infour of 14 provinces.   In Managua, Nicaragua, the government-run radio Voice ofNicaragua broadcast a statement by Salvadoran guerrillas warningcivilians living near military installations to leave.   The rebel statement also warned Salvadorans that areas neardowned power lines had been mined and said first-aid vehiclesshould not transport military casualties.
