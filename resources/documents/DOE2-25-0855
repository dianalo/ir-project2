<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-25-0855 </DOCNO><TEXT>This report describes the modifications that have been made to enhancethe original Allowable Residual Contamination Level (ARCL) method tomake it more applicable to site-specific analyses. This version considersthe mixture of radionuclides present at the time of site characterization,the elapsed time after decommissioning when exposure to people couldoccur, and includes a calculation of the upper confidence limit of thepotential dose based on sampling statistics that are developed duringthe site characterization efforts. The upper confidence limit of potentialexposure can now be used for comparison against applicable radiationdose limits (i.e., 25 mrem/yr at Hanford). The level of confidence canbe selected by the user. A wide range of exposure scenarios were evaluated;the rationale used to select the most limiting scenarios is explained.The radiation dose factors used for the inhalation and ingestion pathwayswere also updated to correspond with the radiation dosimetry methodsutilized in the International Commission of Radiological Protection Publications26 and 30 (ICRP 1977; 1979a,b, 1980, 1981, 1982a,b). This simplifiesthe calculations, since ``effective whole body'' doses are now calculated,and also brings the dosimetry methods used in the ARCL method in conformancewith the rationale used by DOE in developing the 25 mrem/yr limit atHanford. 46 refs., 21 figs., 15 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
