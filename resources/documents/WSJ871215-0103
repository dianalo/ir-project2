But a few years ago, badly needing a job, she went to work as office manager of a tiny computer-software company. Offered stock for a token amount, she bought some because other employees were doing so.    The company turned into Lotus Development Corp. With the instant success of its 1-2-3 program, it took off like a rocket. And Ms. Axelrod found herself a millionaire.    But she is an ambivalent one. An unwavering leftist, she has a poster of Fidel Castro on her office wall. She once worked as a counselor to heirs who were so uneasy with their wealth they were hunting for causes to give it to. Now, she began to feel something of the same discomfort.    Like a dozen others who joined this astonishingly successful high-tech company in its infancy, Ms. Axelrod, 36 years old, is finding that getting rich can be easier than being rich.    At first, the Lotus millionaires uniformly report, the windfall was exhilarating. But then came unwanted attention, such as incessant calls from stockbrokers and fund-raisers. Later, for many of them, unexpected strains developed: subtle changes in friendships, confusion about what kind of work they wanted to do or whether they wanted to work at all, and even sieges of soul-searching about how to enjoy their wealth without sacrificing long-held values.    None of them regret their good fortune, of course, or are seeking any sympathy. &quot;There are a lot of problems related to having money,&quot; says Marvin Goldschmitt, a former vice president; &quot;I'm glad I have them.&quot; But in view of how many problems wealth obviously solves, its sudden arrival is leaving some of the early employees surprisingly discombobulated.    Watching Lotus grow was like watching a movie on fast-forward. The company shipped its first product, Lotus 1-2-3, in January 1983, when it was just eight months old. It went public the following summer, and by December had racked up $53 million in sales for its first full year.    The work pace was equally blistering. At his going-away party in 1985, Mr. Goldschmitt told his colleagues, &quot;I am going to do something that will make you extremely jealous. I am going to sleep until I wake up.&quot;    Some of these employees, though, got stock in Lotus for as little as a nickel a share. It has risen 1,500% since then. And of the 46 people who were on the payroll the week Lotus 1-2-3 was shipped in 1983, all but a dozen now have left.    Some are still trying to find a new niche. Mr. Goldschmitt, 36, considered going to graduate school in geology or meteorology. Then he almost invested in an Indian restaurant. Recently, he decided that he prefers computers and is trying to start a new company.    David McElfresh, 49, another former vice president, traveled in Europe, unsuccessfully tried to organize a venture-capital fund for software companies, and consulted for a company that does data processing for credit cards. Now he advises a malpractice-insurance company in Boston. &quot;I'm dabbling,&quot; he says.    The most notable of the Lotus alumni is Mitchell Kapor. He founded the company and was its chairman until he stepped down last year. Now 36, he studies artificial intelligence at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, helps Lotus sell a new product he worked on, and is an investor in a couple of start-up companies and in a deli.    &quot;Many of these individuals talk in the past tense,&quot; says Freda Klein, a former Lotus personnel manager, not referring to any of them in particular. &quot;It's sort of like people who were heroes as adolescents -- the star of the high-school football team, Shirley Temple. What do you do with the rest of your life?&quot; (As for her, she came too late to make a million.)    Palmer True, vice president for operations at Lotus, uses a different analogy. &quot;A lot of the people at Lotus were young, immature -- just like professional ballplayers,&quot; he says. &quot;Ballplayers make a quarter of a million dollars a year for 10 years; some squander it, some save. They get a kind of distorted view of what life is like.&quot;    For Mr. True, the solution was to stay at the company. The oldest of the Lotus millionaires at 54, he is trying to prevent his $4 million fortune from changing his life style. &quot;I still live in the same place,&quot; he says, &quot;and I still drive the same car,&quot; a 1983 Mazda. As a matter of principle, he goes easy on monetary gifts to his grown children. He did buy a vacation house on Cape Cod, and when a neighbor was ill and might have been forced to move, he bought the house so the neighbor could stay.    Christopher Morgan took a more predictable route: He indulged himself. On a chilly afternoon, a fire blazes a fireplace in the 1927 brick mansion that he bought and now shares with a friend. Caged finches chirp in the living room. The lights from the second-floor greenhouse cast an eerie glow on the neighbor's house.    In one room, the 38-year-old Mr. Morgan keeps a Kurzweil music synthesizer, a state-of-the-art stereo and two eight-foot-tall speakers. Another room is given over to a freshly restored Steinway grand player piano. Up a spiral staircase is a book-lined study with two personal computers and a device to keep tabs on the stock market. When new furniture arrives, the basement will become an office and warehouse for his new venture: a rare-books business specializing in works on computer science.    &quot;I had to come to terms with the urge not to do anything or to stop being productive,&quot; says Mr. Morgan, a Scottish-born steamfitter's son who became a vice president at Lotus. &quot;I used to look upon jobs as a means of subsidizing my other interests,&quot; he says. &quot;Now I'm trying to make my natural inclination into a way of living.&quot;    Other things about work also no longer count, says Dale Troppito, 35, former vice president for engineering at Lotus. &quot;You don't say, 'It's a good job; there might be a promotion in it for me,'&quot; she says. &quot;Your criteria change.&quot; Her husband quit at his company, too, and with the freedom that money buys they formed their own mail-order software company.    In some ways, that freedom is a burden. &quot;You have to decide what do you really want to do,&quot; says Jonathan Sachs, 40, who reaped a $20 million fortune from Lotus. &quot;It's one of the questions most people don't have to worry about. They do what they have to do.&quot;    Mr. Sachs wrote the computer code for Lotus 1-2-3. He is still developing software at Lotus -- and still describing his position as &quot;temporary.&quot; He talks of doing something different, working more with people and less with computers, but he hasn't. He and his wife fantasize about taking long trips, but haven't.    In 1985 he described in a newspaper interview his yen for a more meaningful life's work than writing a spreadsheet and getting rich. He was flooded with crank mail.    His friend Mr. Goldschmitt was annoyed at him for that burst of candor. The norm is to have to strive daily to accumulate enough worldly goods, Mr. Goldschmitt observes, and &quot;society gets angry when you raise the question: 'Okay, I made that goal, now what do you want me to do?'&quot;    But Mr. Sachs isn't interested in early retirement, any more than the other Lotus millionaires. &quot;I don't know how to not work,&quot; he says. &quot;Most other people work. If you're not working, it's like being home sick: You just feel like you're not part of society.&quot;    As for his money, he gave about a fifth of it to a conservation foundation he established, then turned the rest over to a money manager. &quot;Mostly I deal with it by pretending it isn't there,&quot; he says.    In one way, Ms. Axelrod, the leftist, was better prepared for the challenges of wealth than her colleagues. In the 1970s she worked for the Haymarket Foundation, a philanthropy formed by scions of rich families who wanted to give money for community organizing. She spent hours with young heirs who were wrestling with the agonies that can come with inherited wealth -- guilt and conflicts between their goals and the expectations of families and peers.    &quot;I was raking in a big $10,000 a year holding their hands because they had problems because they had so much money, trying to get money off them by being helpful and feeling really lousy for myself,&quot; she says. After five years she quit, drifted for a year or so and then met Mr. Kapor. At his company, a forerunner to Lotus, she advanced from office manager to vice president of human resources. But her Lotus shares did even better: A $4,000 investment became $9 million.    Most of the Lotus people wanted wealth even if they never expected it, but not Ms. Axelrod. &quot;Janet is the kind of gal who looked down her nose at people who are like she is now -- with lots of money,&quot; says G. Mead Wyman, a former Lotus financial officer.    A few of her old friends thought she had sold out at Lotus. They wondered, she recalls, &quot;Why is she working so bloody hard for something that is not so important? For a business? For a company?&quot;    When she hit the jackpot, she considered setting aside enough to live on and giving away the rest. But &quot;it was too new to me,&quot; she says. &quot;I didn't want to make any irrevocable decisions.&quot; Instead, she held on to $1 million in Lotus stock and invested the rest of her money with a bank that offers &quot;socially responsible money management.&quot; She also gives to certain organizations she strongly believes in.    She has been flooded with requests from others, more so than any of her old Lotus colleagues. &quot;Anybody who ever raised money on the left knew me,&quot; she says. But, she says with a smile, &quot;at Haymarket, I learned how to say no. First I had a five-year course in learning how to be rich, and then I got rich.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
