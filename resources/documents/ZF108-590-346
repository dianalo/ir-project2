 Conventional wisdom has it that one should never connect or disconnectanything when the Mac is turned on.andP;  But isn't this a leftover from the earlydays, when cables had connectors that could temporarily make the &quot;wrong&quot;contact?andP;  It hardly seems possible that connecting or disconnecting akeyboard or a mouse while the Mac is turned on could cause any damage.andP;  Isn'tunnecessarily turning the Mac on and off worse?andM;George Vogel Newton, MAandM;A.andP;  No!andP;  Never connect or disconnect anything without first shutting downyour Mac and all the peripherals.andP;  You may get away with it some of the time,but there's always a chance of damaging an internal component when youconnect a peripheral without first powering everything down.andM;The ADB (Apple Desktop Bus -- the connection for the mouse and keyboard onall Macintoshes from the SE on) is particularly sensitive.andP;  You should,without fail, turn off your Macintosh before plugging anything at all intothe ADB.andM;Don't worry about turning your Macintosh on and off a few extra times.andP;  As Ialways say, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.andP;  And as long asI'm on my soapbox, don't forget to use the Shut Down command before you turnoff the power.andM;The Word aboutandM;Word DictionariesandM;Q.andP;  In Papua, New Guinea, few people can answer my questions about MicrosoftWord.andP;  Perhaps you'll be able to .andP;  .  .andM;The most widely spoken language here is Tok Pisin (New Guinea Pidgin), whichis written with roman letters.andP;  I would like to put together a dictionarythat I could use to perform spelling checks on Tok Pisin documents createdwith Word 4.0.andM;Obviously, it would be preferable if I were able to check the documents inWord, but it appears that Word does not allow you to choose dictionaries.andP;  Ifthis is not possible, is there a standalone spelling checker that has a TokPisin dictionary available?andM;Don Niles Papua, New GuineaandM;A.andP;  Good news and bad news: The good news (according to Microsoft) is thatthere are indeed tools available for assembling a Tok Pisin dictionary.andP;  Thebad news is that they are very expensive -- about $25,000.andM;I was unable to uncover any product--spelling checker or otherwise--with aTok Pisin dictionary.andP;  It appears that your only options is to create a TokPisin User Dictionary in Word 4.0.andP;  Good luck!andM;Microsoft WordandM;Dictionaries, Part IIandM;Q.andP;  I've been told that there is a German dictionary available for Word 4.0.andO;Is this true?andP;  If so, where can I obtain it?andP;  Is there a French dictionarytoo?andM;David Lee Los Angeles, CAandM;A.andP;  Microsoft recently announced the availability of supplementalforeign-language, medical, and legal dictionaries for Word 4.0.andP;  The foreignlanguages currently available are French, German, Dutch, British (is Britishreally considered a separate language?), Italian, Spanish, and Swedish.andP;  Eachdictionary costs $75 plus $5.50 for shipping and handling.andP;  To order, callEditor's Choice at (800) 646-1116.andM;Windows: What a DumpandM;Q.andP;  I write software documentation and am currently documenting a PC programthat runs in the Microsoft Windows environment.andP;  Do you know of a programthat will capture Windows screens in a file that I can use on a Mac?andP;  I wantto paste the pictures into Word.andM;Diana Rowden Dallas, TXandM;A.andP;  I don't know a PC from an Amiga, but I knew where to go to find youranswer -- Computer Database Plus, available through CompuServe.andP;  (Log on andtype GO COMPLIB).andP;  It contains citations and full-text articles from morethan 130 magazines, newspapers, and journals, including MacUser, BYTE, and PCMagazine.andM;To find the product you described, I performed a keyword search for &quot;screenand capture.&quot;andP;  Of the 14 articles the search turned up, one -- entitled&quot;Screen-Capture Programs Help Get It All Down on Paper&quot; -- stood out as alikely candidate.andP;  That article was described as an evaluation of fourscreen-capture programs, and it appeared in PCWeek, November 27, 1989.andM;Not having that particular issue handy, I downloaded the full text of thearticle and discovered that the product you need is called Hotshot Graphics1.5 ($249 from Symsoft; [415] 941-1552).andP;  It can capture screen images fromWindows applications and save them in your choice of formats -- TIFF, EPSF,PCX, or IMG.andP;  It also has a graphics editor that, according to the article,includes a &quot;range of tools that rivals those in most paint packages.&quot;andM;Computer Database Plus costs $.40 per minute, plus $1 per abstract and/or$2.50 per abstract with full text.andP;  The search described here cost less than$10.andM;A Clean ScreenandM;Q.andP;  I have a Mac IIcx with an AppleColor 13-inch monitor.andP;  For some reason,it seems to attract even more than its share of dust.andP;  I wipe the screen off,as per the manual's instructions, but within days another wonderfullydisgusting coating reappears.andP;  Not only that, but so much dust has bonded tothe monitor's case that it's currently an ugly grayish-Black hue.andM;Could you suggest some way to remove this glop without damaging the tube orcase finish?andP;  And is there any way to &quot;demagnetize&quot; the thing to keep thedust from building up again so quickly?andM;Aaron Dickey New York, NYandM;A.andP;  I have an Apple color monitor too, and it's always attracting glop andgoop.andP;  I hate it (the glop and goop, that is), so I use commercialmonitor-cleaning wipes (available at good office-supply stores everywhere).andM;I've got two brands sitting on my shelf: Screen wipe and Liquid Paper.andP;  Theyclean your screen and reduce static buildup.andP;  Both work as promised--I useone or the other at least once a week.andM;To clean the case of the monitor and the computer itself, I use a commercialspray such as Formula 409 about once a month.andP;  Be sure you don't spray itdirectly onto the case; instead, spray a bit on a cloth.andP;  I've found thatpaper towels don't hold up well, so use real cloth.andP;  Be extremely careful notto get any cleanser on the monitor glass.andM;Finally, I cover my monitor when it's not in use.andP;  I use an old ski scarf.andO;You can buy custom covers for most monitors, but my scarf was cheaper andworks fine.andP;  (And it looks cool too!)andM;Where There'sandM;a Will...andM;Q.andP;  I recently purchased the program WillMaker from Nolo Press.andP;  The programdoes not produce a text file.andP;  I have wasted hours trying to figure out howto get a text file of my will from this program so I can alter some of thewording and change its arrangement on the page, the font that it uses, andthe quality of the printing (it prints out only in the Faster mode).andM;I called Nolo to ask about it, and they just told me to retype the wholewill.andP;  If it were just for me, that might be OK, but I'd like to use thisprogram with other members of my family.andP;  Any suggestions?andM;Steve Dutton Harwood Heights, ILandM;A.andP;  According to the folks at Nolo Press, there's no way to extract tocoherent version of your will from the saved file, using any of the currentversions of WillMaker.andP;  If you try to use a program such as Can-Operator or1st Aid Kit, you'll get only disjointed pieces of text in random order, sodon't botherandM;Nolo says that it designed the program this way to prevent users from makingchanges that might invalidate their will.andP;  That makes sense, but the companyhas had to many users ask for text export that it's included that feature inversion 4.0, which should be available by the time you read this.andM;Registered user will get a card or letter with details for obtaining anupgrade.andP;  No price had been set at press time.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
