The author will also attempt a rational answerto the question of how much, and what kind of rearing space should beprovided for a given flow, water quality, fish size, and species to deliverboth quality and quantity. The economic optimum, i.e., the greatest numberor weight of fish per unit space, and the product optimum, best qualityfish produced under the least amount of stress, must be mutually satisfied.Where is this proper balance of quality and quantity? It seems to bea moving target.</TEXT></DOC>
