MARTINEZ</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Oil prices should slip lower in the secondquarter after a surprising $7 surge over the last six months, asparties on both sides of the barrel adjust to a more favorablepetroleum climate, analysts say.   The onset of warmer weather should dampen demand, which has beenrunning higher than normal this year.   Moreover, the 13 OPEC nations might not want prices to rise muchhigher for fear that such large non-OPEC producers as the UnitedStates, Britain and Canada will be encouraged to start pumping moreof their own oil.   On Thursday, the April contract for West Texas Intermediate, thebenchmark U.S. crude, finished at $19.84 a barrel on the New YorkMercantile Exchange, the highest since the near-month contractclosed at $19.96 on Oct. 30, 1987. In early trading today, pricestopped the $20 level for the first time since October 1987.   ``We're close to what I call a blow-off, which means we are readyto set a top,'' said Nauman Barakat, vice president of energyinvestments for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.   Barakat said Thursday he expects prices to top $21 over the nextfew weeks before reversing and heading back toward $19.   ``I don't think the market can sustain $20 for any length oftime,'' said James Steel, an energy analyst with Refco Inc. ``Atthat price we will see more production from OPEC as well as Canada,the United States and others.''   ``OPEC has to watch out that they don't undermine their ownposition like they did in 1979,'' Steel said.   High oil prices in 1979 fueled by an Arab oil embargo against theUnited States and Western Europe led to more exploration and higherproduction by non-OPEC countries. Strong prices also encouragedconservation, and demand for OPEC oil fell.   Last October, crude prices sank to a two-year low of $12.60 abarrel due to a world glut stemming partly from overproduction bythe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. In November,after months of haggling, the cartel decided to set a productionlimit of 18.5 million barrels a day to lift crude prices to $18 abarrel.   Although OPEC continues producing more than 19 million barrels aday, the cutbacks have been enough to restore investor confidenceand spur demand among customers who had allowed their inventories todwindle, market observers say.   Also, for the first time ever, several non-OPEC producers such asMexico and the Soviet Union have decided to cut exports by about300,000 barrels in the second quarter as a show of unity with OPEC.Problems with various oil producing facilities in the North Sea anddeclining production in the United States also have contributed tolower output.   While production has declined, demand and prices have risen andU.S. oil supplies have dwindled.   Analysts said buyers had allowed their inventories to slip asprices inched up, thinking prices would decline with the approach ofwarmer weather. But that weakness did not materialize and customershave been buying inventory to avoid possibly higher prices later,Barakat said.   A 48-cent surge in West Texas Intermediate on Wednesday stemmedpartly from an American Petroleum Institute report showing crude oiland product inventories had fallen dramatically in the week endedMarch 10. Heating oil stocks reached their lowest point since 1972,due largely to a decline in U.S. refinery capacity and an increasein Middle Eastern capacity, analysts said.   Strong demand also reflects healthy economies in major producingareas, including the United States, Western Europe and the Far East,Steel said.   However, ``there's not that much more demand to justify muchhigher prices,'' Steel said. ``I don't see any pressure now, but Ithink we will reach an equilibrium sometime soon.''   Japan and some European countries already have lowered theircrude orders from February levels, analysts said.   John O'Dea, manager of international energy futures at DeanWitter Reynolds Inc., said that although strong demand and loweroutput imply higher prices, $18 probably was closer to a long-termprice.   ``Anything much over $18 a barrel, the (OPEC) countries will makea pretty good profit,'' he said. ``But market share is alsoimportant, maybe more so than profits.''</TEXT></DOC>
