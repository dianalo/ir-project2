That's the outlook of 10 economists and currency dealersin Tokyo; Frankfurt, West Germany; London and New Yorkinterviewed by Dow Jones International News Service. By theend of May, these experts' average forecast calls for thedollar to stand at 159.20 yen and 1.6980 marks. The mark isseen slipping to 93.76 yen.</LP><TEXT>   In late Friday afternoon New York trading, the dollar wasat 159.30 yen, up from 159.23 yen late Thursday, and at1.6775 marks, down from 1.6803 marks. The mark was trading at94.96 yen up from 94.76 yen.   Where and whether interest rates will rise remains asource of widespread speculation and disagreement. While mostsee real U.S. rates rising relative to Japanese and WestGerman rates, others see them falling or holding even.   But there is a consensus that the yen is undervalued andthe mark overvalued, suggesting both deserve correction.   At the beginning of April, a similar survey predicted thedollar would be about 156.73 yen by the end of April, withestimates spread evenly between 162 yen and 150 yen. One bearsaid 136 yen.   The early April survey saw the dollar at 1.7150 marks bythe end of April, with estimates ranging from a low of 1.65marks to a high of 1.75 marks.   &quot;Real&quot; interest rates -- nominal rates minus anticipatedinflation -- were cited by most in the survey as the key topredicting exchange rates. While acknowledging problems withthe political and economic unification of the two Germanys,most of the respondents said the mark would be the maincurrency of Europe in the 1990s. The survey's two West Germanexperts, however, were relatively bearish on the mark'sprospects for May.   Ingo Kuller, chief trader at Westdeutsche LandesbankGirozentrale in Duesseldorf, said reunification will cast ashadow over the mark for many months to come, and theenergies of the Bundesbank will be diverted away from holdingthe dollar down as it grapples with the specter of risinginflation. He sees the dollar climbing to 1.7640 marks by theend of May and higher, to 1.78 marks, in 90 days.   Klaus Groner, chief trader at Bayerische Vereinsbank inMunich, differs over the 90-day term, expecting the U.S.currency to fall against the mark to 1.65 marks later in thespring as worries about the monetary union with East Germanyabate. &quot;I see a renaissance for the mark,&quot; he said. &quot;The waythe government in Bonn is systematically tackling theproblems with monetary union is encouraging.&quot;   Most of the respondents said the Bundesbank can keepinflation under wraps, predicting a 3% or lower rate for theyear. Though most survey respondents said a boost in WestGerman interest rates was in the cards, one economistsuggested that nation's rates would ease because politics hasoutrun economics.   &quot;I recognize it's a new ball game for the Germans,&quot; saidIrwin Kellner, chief economist for Manufacturers HanoverTrust in New York, &quot;but I'd say the markets have alreadydiscounted the effects of this and then some,&quot; leaving thedollar room to correct.   Mr. Kellner said trade-related pressures have led to anundervaluation of the dollar against European currencies andan overvaluation against the yen. The dollar should be buyingfewer than 140 yen, he said, instead of 159 yen.   The U.S. posted an unadjusted $959.6 million trade surpluswith Western Europe in February, compared with a $309.8million deficit in January, putting the U.S. ahead $650million through March. Against Japan, meanwhile, theunadjusted trade gap widened in February to $3.12 billionfrom $2.86 billion in January.   Survey participants generally agreed the Japanese baseinterest rate wouldn't fall, but were reluctant to say it wascertain to rise in the month or 90-day period. The yen, inthis scenario, likely will stay weak but not slip further.   Russell Sheldon, senior economist at Mellon Bank,Pittsburgh, said Japan may have an emerging inflationproblem. &quot;I don't think they'll be tightening policy to thedegree they'd need to&quot; to control inflation, he said. Japan'sconsumer prices, a key index of inflation, rose 2.9% in thefiscal year ended March 31, the largest gain since 1981.   As long as Tokyo stock and government bond markets stayshaky and prospects for European growth are good, &quot;strongdemand for dollars and other currencies will keep the yenweak,&quot; said Shigeito Yanase, manager of foreign-exchangetrading at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. in Tokyo.   Political problems still dog the yen, Mr. Yanase noted.Talk in Tokyo that Liberal Democratic Party elders couldforce Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu to resign beforea July economic summit in Houston will hinder any sort of yenrecovery, he said.   Prospects for a tightening of U.S. monetary policy, whichwould tend to boost the dollar, are at least as tenuous asthose for Japan and West Germany. Again, no one saw the U.S.Federal Reserve lowering interest rates, but only two saidflat-out that rates would rise.   Supporting that view were sharply higher inflationreadings released Friday with U.S. provisional first-quartergross national product data. The implicit price deflator roseat a 5.7% rate, the largest increase since the third quarterof 1982, and the fixed-weight deflator, another inflationgauge, was up 6.5%, the largest leap since the fourth quarterof 1981.   &quot;U.S. consumer price inflation should be around 4.5% inthe second quarter, an unacceptable level for the FederalReserve Board,&quot; said a senior corporate dealer with a largeTokyo-based bank.   The same dealer said growth in Japanese institutionalinvestor demand for dollar-denominated investments shouldfall off, but dollar investments will still grow in absoluteterms.   Forecasts for the pound averaged $1.613 in 30 days and$1.606 in 90 days, and were the most tightly-groupedforecasts among the currencies surveyed. All 10 participantssaid the pound would be about $1.6 in both periods, rangingfrom five $1.6 estimates to a low of $1.65 in the 30 days;for the longer period, estimates ranged from a bearish $1.53to $1.67. Late Friday in New York, sterling was at $1.6350,below $1.6343 late Thursday in New York.   On New York's Commodity Exchange Friday, current-deliverygold settled at $371.10 an ounce, up 20 cents. Because ofcomputer failure, trading was limited. Estimated volume wasonly 700,000 ounces.   In Hong Kong Monday, gold was quoted at $371.60 an ounce.   ---   Douglas Appell and Christopher Hill in Tokyo, ErikKirschbaum in Frankfurt, Nicholas Hastings in London andBrandon Mitchener in New York contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
