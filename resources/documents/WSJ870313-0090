Col. Oliver North challenging the constitutionality of independent counsels, but didn't resolve the basic legal issues raised by the suits.    In a 21-page opinion issued yesterday, U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker dismissed Col. North's lawsuits on procedural grounds after concluding that the challenges weren't &quot;ripe&quot; for decision. The judge said the &quot;constitutional arguments shouldn't be considered until&quot; the criminal investigation headed by independent counsel Lawrence Walsh &quot;has run its course.&quot;    Meanwhile, a federals appeals court temporarily blocked another independent counsel from asking a grand jury to indict former deputy White House Chief of Staff Michael Deaver on perjury charges.    Raising the same question of whether a challenge to the constitutionality of the independent counsel law is premature before any charges have been brought, the three-judge appeals court asked the lawyers in the Deaver case to file briefs by Monday. The appeals court indicated it will rule on Tuesday whether to continue the stay or permit independent counsel Whitney North Seymour to seek indictments.    The legal maneuvering -- certain to continue next week -- centers on whether the investigations should be blocked in midcourse, while the courts resolve constitutional questions about use of counsels under the 1978 Ethics in Government Act. The legal arguments are likely to be raised again, if indictments are issued against either Col. North or Mr. Deaver.    Attorneys for both men contend that court-appointed independent counsels created under the 1978 law violate the separation-of-powers doctrine by exercising prosecutorial power typically reserved for officials of the executive branch of government.    Judge Parker said in his opinion that Col. North's challenge to Mr. Walsh's authority raises &quot;issues of particularly grave constitutional importance,&quot; extending to the powers of independent federal agencies. However, he ruled that Col. North failed to demonstrate sufficient &quot;hardship&quot; to warrant interfering with a continuing criminal probe. And he said the lawsuit didn't cite any relevant examples of halting of criminal investigations by courts.    Emphasizing the &quot;important public interest&quot; in allowing the investigation of Col. North to proceed, the judge said that &quot;the nation demands an expeditious and complete disclosure of our government's involvement in the Iran-Contra affair.&quot;    Col. North's lawyers declined to comment on the ruling or whether they plan to appeal. </TEXT></DOC>
