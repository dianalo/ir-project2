I felt fortunate to interview him on Oct. 15, 1967, after his stirringaddress at the Oakland Coliseum Arena for a concert-rally linking the civilrights and anti-war (Vietnam) movements. He spoke fervently on both topics.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  'KING'S WAY' ILLUMINATEDTRIBUTE SUGGESTS THE MARTYR, NOT THE PREACHER  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Classical Music  </MEMO><TEXT>     Black and white together;  I wonder today how King would react to the newconflict on our doorstep.;    Then, King was embarking on an exhaustingnational tour; the exhaustion already showed, but he carried on undaunted. Hisaddress contained an unforgettable figure of speech, using the metaphor ofpiano keys to discuss the races.;    You can play the white keys alone andachieve something, he said. Or the black keys alone, likewise. But to achievethe fullest, richest potential of harmony, you have to use both the white andblack keys together.;    Composer-flutist Newton did use both the white andblack keys abundantly in his 15-minute-long &quot;King's Way&quot; (1989) for a chamberseptet plus soprano. And he sat in for the flute part, leaving the rest tosoprano Joan Beal and members of the San Francisco Contemporary MusicPlayers.;    Newton avoided all the obvious approaches to a King tribute: noKing speech texts, no populist musical style. Apart from a middle movementwhere he quotes -- rather uncomfortably, I thought -- &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; andthe spiritual &quot;Were You There When They Crucified the Lord?,&quot; this was formalnew music, devoid even of jazz.;    Newton selected unlikely biblical texts,one a prayer of thanksgiving, the other a Beatitude (&quot;Blessed are ye when menshall hate you&quot;). Soprano Beal sang the words, but in such a high coloraturadomain that few words were intelligible.;    Overall, however, Newton createda work of fervor and serious purpose, in a severe style more suggestive ofKing the martyr than King the preacher. Newton's ensemble called forvibraphone and other percussion, plus flute, violin, bassoon, violin, pianoand harp.;    Other works on the program showed various similarities, all ofthem being American, instrumental and a quarter-hour in length. ContemporaryMusic Players Director Stephen Mosko -- quite possibly the only conductor onearth confining his name to fine print at the end of the program -- ledBabbitt's &quot;Consortini,&quot; Andrew Frank's Schoenberg-inspired &quot;Moonstruck&quot; andMinnesotan Eleanor Hovda's long crescendo called &quot;Ariadnemusic.&quot;;    As itdoes nearly once a month, the SFCMP brought off an evening of music before ahealthy crowd, including several of the Bay Area's most notable composers.;   Now in its 16th year, the SFCMP is thriving, despite all the obstacles: beingdisplaced from the Museum of Modern Art upstairs and playing in a dead hallacoustically, with no perceptible ventilation.;    Airhead economics;  Youwonder about San Francisco's economics: millions spent on its War Memorialcomplex, yet not even enough for a proper ventilator. When the new Museum ofModern Art is built near the Moscone Center, the stimulating SFCMP seriesshould be given priority, especially to enable concerts to be given alongsideart exhibits.;    If not, we all may end up suffocating on new-music concerts-- which is not exactly what the composers had in mind.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  PAUL HERTELENDY, Mercury News Music Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  San Francisco  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910116  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  565  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday January 16, 199100016202,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
