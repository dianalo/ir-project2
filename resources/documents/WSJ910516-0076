Vasso Papandreou, the EC's commissioner for socialaffairs, said the measure was necessary for health reasons aswell as to prevent trade barriers that could result from aproliferation of different national rules. She said a banalso would help protect those most vulnerable to cigaretteadvertising -- adolescents and children.</LP><TEXT>   Ms. Papandreou said there was growing support in the ECfor an advertising ban, which so far has been introduced inthree community countries. She also cited last year's vote bythe European Parliament calling for such a prohibition.   But the proposal is likely to prove controversial becauseit would hurt the advertising and publishing industries,already suffering from the economic downturn. Tobaccocompanies also are certain to lobby strongly against themeasure, which still must be adopted by EC ministers. In thepast, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands have come outagainst EC restrictions on tobacco advertising.   The proposed legislation would prohibit all tobaccoadvertising in publications, billboards and movie theaters asof Jan. 1, 1993. It also would ban advertising of otherproducts sporting tobacco companies' logos, such as T-shirtsand shoes. Television advertising of tobacco products isbanned under separate EC legislation that comes into forcelater this year.   An exception to the ban would be advertising at placeswhere tobacco products are sold. In addition, companies whosemain line of business isn't tobacco, such as Dunhill, wouldbe allowed to advertise products with their name on it.   Tobacco companies condemned the proposal, saying it was&quot;at odds with marketplace realities&quot; and would serve toprotect state-owned cigarette monopolies.   &quot;A large body of professional research has failed toestablish any connection between advertising and totalcigarette consumption; nor does the evidence support thetheory that advertising leads people to start smoking,&quot; theConfederation of European Community Cigarette Manufacturerssaid.   Paul Maglione, a spokesman for Philip Morris, said some ECcountries had ulterior motives in supporting a ban on tobaccoadvertising. France, Italy and Portugal, which recently havebanned advertising, have state tobacco monopolies that arelosing market share to international tobacco companies, hesaid.   EC commission officials, however, rejected such arguments,citing Norway, which has no tobacco industry and was one ofthe first countries to ban advertising.</TEXT></DOC>
