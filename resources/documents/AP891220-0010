Baker III says heregrets possibly misleading the American public about a secret tripto China taken by two high-level Bush administration officials.   Baker said through a spokeswoman Tuesday night ``he feltobligated to protect the secrecy of a mission the president wishedto have classified.''   Speaking for Baker, spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler added: ``Heregrets that he may have misled some...''   It was the first acknowledgement of error since the White Houseannounced on Dec. 9 that national security adviser Brent Scowcroftand Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger were visitingBeijing.   Their trip was roundly condemned in Congress as a friendlygesture to China and a cancellation of the ban President Bushimposed on high-level exchanges after pro-democracy students weremassacred in early June in Tiananmen Square.   Another sanction crumbled Tuesday night when Bush moved to end aban that prevented the U.S. Export-Import bank from providingfinancial aid to companies doing business in China.   Also, the White House announced that Bush had approved theexport of three communications satellites expected to be launchedby China, saying the deal was in the ``national interest.''   Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., called Bush's approval of thesatellite export licenses ``a true outrage'' and ``another effortto curry favor with the hardliners in Beijing and an insult to thememory of those who died for democracy in Tiananmen Square.''   Criticism also mounted on Capitol Hill against this month'svisit by Scowcroft and Eagleburger to Beijing, as well as anearlier one in July.   ``To have sent two of our highest level officials to Beijingonly weeks after announcing a ban on such exchanges makes thepresident look like a wimp in Beijing and a hypocrite inWashington,'' said Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., a leadingcongressional spokesman on Asia issues.   In defense of Bush's actions, White House spokesman MarlinFitzwater said: ``It is not misleading to not tell you abouteverything he's doing. The president's up there in the Oval Officedoing things all day long that you don't know and won't know aboutand that's not misleading.''   Baker, appearing on ABC-TV on Dec. 10, called the trip taken inearly December to Beijing by Scowcroft and Eagleburger ``the firsttime we've had high-level U.S. officials go to the People'sRepublic of China.''   On Monday, however, the White House disclosed Scowcroft andEagleburger also had made a secret trip to China in July.   Asked about the apparent discrepancy, State Departmentspokeswoman Tutwiler said Baker had explicitly acknowledged theDecember trip by Scowcroft and Eagleburger ``was not the first timewe had high-level contacts'' with China since the crackdown.   She noted that Baker mentioned on ABC his own meeting in Augustwith Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen at a conference onCambodia in Paris.   ``He specifically referred to his own contacts,'' Ms. Tutwilersaid. ``But he felt obligated to protect the secrecy of a missionthat the president wished to have classified.   ``He regrets that he may have misled some, but he felt that byacknowledging his own direct involvement it was sufficient to makethe point that this was not the first case of high-level contact.''   Gore sponsored the legislation that forbids the launch ofU.S.-manufacturered satellites on Chinese rockets unless thepresident declares it to be in the U.S. national interest, as Bushhas done.   The Hughes Aircraft Co. is selling the satellites to firms inAustralia and Hong Kong for launching on a Chinese rocket.   ``Approval of these licences is in keeping with the president'spolicy not to disrupt normal commercial relations with China,'' aWhite House statement added.   ``These satellites are intended for civil use and representsignificant investments for the firms, based in Australia and HongKong,'' the statement said. ``It is in the national interest of theUnited States to approve export licenses for the three satellitescurrently being prepared for launch in China.''   The White House also cited ``national interest'' in waivingrestrictions on the Export-Import bank's financing of U.S. businessactivities within China.   The White House said the waiver ``preserves a level playingfield for U.S. business. Additional business activity with Chinawill be considered on a case-by-case basis as part of a continuingreview process.''   One of the few on Capitol Hill who has supported Bush'sovertures, Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, said sending Scowcroft andEagleburger to underscore human rights concerns ``was exactly inconformity with the congressional position, which reflected theviews of the American people.''   But Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., a senior member of the HouseForeign Affairs Committee, said ``the administration did what ittold us they were not doing.''   ``Surely the Chinese would see it that way. If we send thenational security adviser to the president, there is no sanctionfrom the standpoint of China. I don't buy that distinction atall,'' Hamilton said.</TEXT></DOC>
