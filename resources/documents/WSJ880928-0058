In 1987's third quarter, the utility earned $25.6 million, or 43 cents a share, on revenue of $351 million.    Company officials are considering decommissioning the 330,000-kilowatt nuclear plant, located about 35 miles north of Denver. The $39.6 million charge is related to an increase in the estimated cost of decommissioning, which involves removing the nuclear fuel and possibly dismantling the reactor.    The plant, the only high-temperature, helium-cooled nuclear station in the U.S., has been plagued by mechanical trouble since commercial operation began in January 1979. The company is considering a possible conversion to a fossil-fueled plant.    A company executive said the board will continue to review each quarter the company's $2 annual dividend but that a cut wasn't likely. </TEXT></DOC>
