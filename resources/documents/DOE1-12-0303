In ray optics,new three-dimensional solutions have been found which permit a transformationof the angular divergence of a beam of light without loss. A new approachto analyzing reversed optical systems is described. Such solutions andmethods may be significant in fiber optic applications. In wave opticsthe radiance (or specific intensity) has been calculated for uniformlambertian sources. New effects are predicted which may be significantin diffraction limited measurements.</TEXT></DOC>
