But the government, defending the ban, said the Army had theright to follow ``society's moral judgments'' against homosexuals.   In a packed courtroom, an 11-judge panel of the 9th U.S. CircuitCourt of Appeals heard more than an hour of arguments Wednesday inreconsidering a decision by a smaller panel of the court that theArmy's ban on homosexuals was invalid.   The 11-member panel did not issue any decision Wednesday.   In its 2-1 decision, the three-judge panel declared thathomosexuals, as a historically persecuted group, were entitled tothe same strict constitutional protections against discriminationgiven to racial and religious minorities. It was the first federalappellate court to reach those conclusions.   The lawyer for former soldier Perry Watkins of Tacoma, Wash.,told the 11 judges Wednesday that the Army has no morejustification in barring homosexuals than it did in locking upJapanese-Americans in World War II.   ``There was no evidence to support the Army's assertion that allJapanese-Americans were not loyal. There is no evidence to supportthe Army's assertion that all homosexuals cannot effectively servethe military,'' said James Lobsenz, an American Civil LibertiesUnion lawyer.   The Army's goal in excluding homosexuals, Lobsenz said, is ``tocater to private bigotry.''   But Justice Department attorney E. Roy Hawkens said the Army hadthe right to follow ``society's moral judgments'' againsthomosexuals.   ``Congress has given the military broad authority to determinewhat is appropriate conduct,'' he said. The confined militaryenvironment ``provides the opportunity for (homosexual) conduct,which is disruptive,'' Hawkens argued.   Hawkens also contended that a 1986 U.S. Supreme Court rulingupholding a Georgia anti-sodomy law had foreclosed broadconstitutional protections for homosexuals, an argument Lobsenzdisputed.   In its February ruling, the three-judge appellate panel said theGeorgia sodomy case had only denied constitutional protection forhomosexual acts, and had not ruled out protections based on sexualorientation.   But the legal effect of that ruling was set aside when an11-judge panel of the court agreed to hear the government's appeal.   Watkins, now 40 and unemployed, told reporters he would be happyto return to the Army if he won the case. A personnel sergeant withhigh job evaluations, he was four years short of pensioneligibility when he was discharged in 1984.   Lobsenz argued that the Army had made a binding promise toWatkins by letting him re-enlist repeatedly after he informedauthorities of his homosexuality when he was drafted.   During that time, Defense Department regulations prohibited theenlistment or re-enlistment of homosexuals, but did not requireimmediate discharge of a soldier whose homosexuality was discoveredwhile in the service, Lobsenz said.   But the regulations were changed in March 1981 to requiredischarge of homosexuals in service. Watkins applied forreenlistment soon afterward and was rejected. He was dischargedafter an initial federal court ruling in his favor was reversed.</TEXT></DOC>
