 For example, a financialanalysis expert system could build a model application that combines theknowledge of several of a company's top-flight analysts to evaluate theinvestment potential of a start-up company.andM;An expert system also can preserve expertise that soon may be lost to anorganization.andP;  More than a few companies are facing the prospect that theirhuman experts may be retiring shortly or moving to their next job.andP;  An expertsystem can help a company capitalize on employees' experience and retain itindefinitely.andM;And on a day-to-day level, sending a tape loaded with an expert systemapplication to a remote field office costs far less than relocating a humanexpert with family in tow, to that same office.andM;To implement an expert system properly, a company must be prepared to takeits time and start on a small scale, so it can develop the necessary in-houseexpertise and eliminate problems while the application is a manageable size.andM;An expert system application takes time to develop and will not generate areturn on investment (ROI) until a large-scale implementation can be put intoproduction, spreading the expert system's benefits across the broadestpossible base.andP;  Many users report that it takes two to five years before afully operational system is in place, and three years before cost savingsstart to add up.andM;BEGINNING THE TRANSFORMATIONandM;In short, the entry costs into this technology are high, but once anexpert-system-based production system is up and running, the long-termbenefits can be substantial.andM;Despite recent gains in the tools for developing these systems--for example,development environments that are far easier to use than the original expertsystem languages--creating an expert system still suffers from complexsoftware development problems.andM;Most likely, it will be necessary to hire a knowledge engineer (an expertsystems programmer) to oversee the project and work with the experts whopossess the knowledge that the company seeks to transform into computerlogic.andM;To determine the true costs associated with developing an expert systemapplication, the cost of the acquisition process--including the time that thehuman experts are not spending on their normal duties--will have to be addedto a knowledge engineer's annual salary, which ranges from $60,000 to$100,000.andM;The reason for the generally slow acceptance of expert systems in thecommercial marketplace has been that developing an expert system is such alabor-intensive procedure.andP;  (See &quot;Labor costs of an expert system,&quot; page 39.)andM;In addition to having to categorize a domain expert's knowledge, the expertsystem programmer must codify the necessary information.andM;Before expert system shells became an option, developers had to take the morecostly approach of starting from scratch and using primarily either Lisp orProlog languages.andM;Originally, these languages were designed specifically for encoding the typeof rules-based procedures and knowledge-based data that an expert systemrequired, just as languages such as Cobol and Fortran were designed forspecific business and engineering tasks, respectively.andM;A Lisp workstation often sold for $23,000; a large Lisp or Prolog projectoften required an outlay of $500,000 to $1 million.andM;DIFFICULTIES SPURRED SHELLSandM;The difficulties presented by these two languages were the main catalyst forthe shells that have flooded the expert systems market and provided knowledgeengineers with the tools to develop cost-effective expert systems.andM;The shells provide a more economical way to do rapid prototyping, which isthe predominant method of systemizing the required knowledge.andM;Many sites still use Lisp and Prolog, but expert system shells, which cutdevelopment time, are seeing steadily greater use, largely for the samereasons that 4GLs and CASE tools are being used for other programming tasks:They cut down on the labor of what otherwise would be expensive, complexsoftware development tasks.andM;Expert system shells are based on either rules-based or frame-based systems.andO;On average, frame-based tools are more expensive and have a higher learningcurve than rules-based systems.andM;Rules-based expert systems represent their knowledge as a set of &quot;if...then&quot;rules or tests, through which the information passes, branching from one ruleto another until the expert system reaches a conclusion.andM;Frame-based systems consist of a list of properties and associated values.andO;Each frame can hold many data attributes that describe a certain state.andO;These frames might best be compared to objects in object-orientedprogramming.andM;An advantage of the frame structure is its simple representation of the realworld and its ability to organize frames into similar classes or hierarchies,just as objects can be similarly organized.andP;  Frames are used more often forlarge, complex expert systems.andM;Expert system development shells, which commanded $50,000 in the early 1980s,are now available on low-end VAXes and workstations for as little as $5,000.andM;Of the three categories of expert system shells, the low-priced, stand-alone,limited-capability PC shells are priced at about $500.andM;At the next level are the high-end-PC- and workstation-based shells, whichusually are linked to packages running on midrange platforms.andP;  Prices forthese shells range from $5,000 to $10,000.andM;At the top of the pyramid are products aimed at minicomputer and mainframeenvironments, which are priced from $50,000 to $200,000, depending onconfigurations and features.andM;With the advent of these cost-effective shells, the benefits of developing anexpert system application are increased productivity, reduced staffing, andimproved sales and service.andM;As these applications yield savings and higher profit margins, moreorganizations will have to adopt expert systems to remain competitive.andM;One of the key benefits of an expert system is lower overhead.andP;  Routinecustomer service from a remote site via an expert system application is moreeconomical than on-site visits when airfare and per-diem costs are added up.andM;Wherever possible, an expert system is a prudent replacement for repetitive,labor-intensive, problem-solving tasks--configuring a VAXcluster, forexample.andP;  It is much more cost-effective to have a single-minded,knowledge-based system handle such problems.andM;START SMALLandM;Beyond picking the right type of shell for your application and hiring theappropriate personnel, there are several important steps that, if fumbled,could doom a project.andM;The one sure method of sinking a project is to attempt something overlyambitious that overwhelms the development team.andP;  Experienced expert systemsdevelopers caution that the wisest course is to start out small.andM;E.I.andP;  du Pont de Nemours and Co. of Wilmington, Del., did this when itdeveloped an expert system that provided prodigious returns.andP;  Du Pont startedsmall in 1985 with its in-house Tool Kit, an expert system shell fordeveloping process control sytems.andM;The expert system design enabled Du Pont to replace human expertise withautomated process control, a key source of savings for the chemicalmanufacturer.andM;Today, with more than 400 VAX/VMS expert systems, including many built withthe original Tool Kit, Du Pont continues working its way through moredifficult problems.andM;With just a small problem to solve and using the Tool Kit, the manufacturerrealized an initial ROI of seven times the investment in salaries, benefits,training, software and hardware that was required to create the application.andO;This provided the initial ROI that a new application often requires to gaincorporate acceptance.andM;By 1987, after expanding the program, Du Pont officials cited a 1,500 percentROI and an aggregate savings of $10 million.andM;Even today, the company's investment is still providing valuable returns: Theaverage start-up time needed to develop an average-sized expert systemapplication is one man-month.andP;  The average ROI is about $100,000 per monthper application, according to Du Pont officials.andM;One of the best examples of a company that has used expert systems to itslong-term fiscal advantage is DEC itself.andP;  DEC made a major investment inexpert systems more than a decade ago.andM;Beginning with XCON, an expert system that creates customized VAX/VMSconfigurations, DEC has built hundreds of expert system applicationsscattered throughout its plants and offices worldwide.andP;  (See &quot;No.andP;  of rulesvs.andP;  development manpower: DEC's expert system configuration,&quot; page 40.)andM;This multimillion-dollar effort apparently has paid off.andP;  In addition toXCON, expert system applications such as XCluster (for configuringVAXclusters) and network configuration and VAX performance analyzers based onexpert systems have saved the company $1 billion in the first 10 years ofuse.andM;After using the XCON system for four years, DEC phased out six configurationplants, leaving a technical/configuration staff of about 30 employees, whichhas remained at that level.andM;In the same time period, the number of options available for configuring aVAX has increased tenfold.andP;  In addition, the 35 percent configuration errorrate common in the late 1970s has fallen to an average rate of 0.001 percent,officials said.andM;DEC keeps its XCON system current by updating it quarterly.andP;  The company isable to maintain all its expert systems with a staff of about 250 knowledgeengineers.andM;Not surprisingly, DEC has been doing good business as a result of its entryinto expert systems.andM;DEC makes $180 million on hardware sales annually.andP;  Through the increasinguse of expert systems such as XCON, DEC has cut the overhead of thisall-important segment of its business dramatically, industry officials said.andM;Although DEC was willing to spend a lot of money and years to develop itsexpert system applications, not every company has the resources available todevote to what could become an expensive albatross.andM;Despite the hype over expert systems, it's still possible for a company tosquander both time and money trying to find a problem for the expert systemssolution.andM;For example, the Randamp;D arm of one large manufacturer once spent thousands ofman-hours developing an expert system to analyze the results of anintegrated-circuit substrate test.andM;Years after development was finished, the human expert remained on the job,watching over the expert system as if it were a barely competent employee.andO;No savings were realized.andP;  The system's domain was too limited, and its errorrate was too high.andM;The first step in devising an expert system without incurring sky-highdevelopment costs is to measure manpower requirements accurately.andM;Schwartz Associates, an expert systems consulting company in Mountain View,Calif., has created a formula for estimating the development costs for aprototype, which can be used to estimate the total cost of development.andM;This method helps buyers calculate the time required by the knowledgeengineer, the domain expert whose knowledge is being systemized, theassistant knowledge engineer, the user and management to get a system up andrunning.andM;The process begins by charting the time needed to prototype the 10 mostdifficult cases--problems that take the most time to solve--followed by atime estimate for prototyping additional cases, to achieve a final, totalestimate.andM;Calculating how long it will take the knowledge engineer to complete the 10cases forms the center-piece of the Schwartz formula.andM;For example, if it takes a knowledge engineer one man-month to settle thefirst 10 cases of a prototype for a 100-case diagnostic system, it will takea minimum of 7.5 man-months to develop the rest of the system (for arules-based system).andP;  However, the time required to develop the remaining 90cases will not accrue in a linear pattern.andM;The manpower needs for a rules-based system probably are greater than thosefor a frame-based system.andP;  Frame-based systems encapsulate cases intosomething similar to objects so they are easily arranged to representreal-world situations.andM;Regardless of whether a rules-based or frame-based system is used, one mustalso figure in the extra time required for management overhead and unforeseendifficulties.andM;Designing the interfaces between an end user and the expert systemapplication itself--as well as interfaces to other applications containingdata required by the expert system--is another crucial variable that will addto a development project's cost, according to the Schwartz Associates model.andM;This step will likely amount to another 20 percent to 40 percent of theknowledge engineer's required time.andP;  Add to that another 20 percent chunk forbuilding hooks to other software.andP;  The total man-months needed to complete arules-based system for the above example would be, at best, 19.4 man-months.andM;However, it is difficult to predict how much more manpower will be needed toadd cases to a rules-based system.andP;  Experience can cut the time needed to addthe second 10 cases, but adding cases with this level of ease won't lastlong.andM;At some point during development, the manpower needed to add cases couldexceed the original time frame by as much as five times.andP;  The complexity ofrules and the data required will complicate the task of adding new rulesexponentially.andM;This discontinuity is unpredictable, depending on the structure of the expertsystem and the knowledge base.andP;  When this point is reached, the mainknowledge base may have to be broken down into smaller knowledge bases,according to the Schwartz model.andM;According to the formula, the situation is better for a frame-based system,which will take the same theoretical development team 13.2 to 23.5 man-monthsto complete.andP;  But frame-based systems often are more expensive to buy thanrules-based systems and are much more difficult to use.andM;Also, according to Achwartz Associates, prototyping the first 10 frame-basedcases will take longer than a rules-based system.andM;The difference in manpower costs represents only one consideration whendeciding whether to purchase a rules- or frame-based expert system.andP;  Theresults of the six-month prototyping alwo weigh heavily in the calculation.andM;In general, rules-based systems probably will continue to be used indiagnostic and training systems: Frame-based systems will be the choice ofmore sophisticated users.andM;Rules-based systems are more appropriate for small projects; frame-basedsystems are more effective for tackling large problems.andM;For prototypes, a development team needs to pick a simple problem that isdirectly tied to the company's business.andP;  A good rule of thumb is to setaside six man-months spread out over six calendar months.andM;In addition, a company should expect to spend at least $10,000 for consultingservices.andM;Along with these considerations, the structure and maintenance of theknowledge base, reasoning methods of the inference engines, tools of theshell and the integration of the shell all play major roles in the ROI of anexpert system shell purchase.andM;The salaries and efforts of the knowledge engineer, domain expert and otherproject team members also play a role.andP;  But the financial gains ofimplementing an expert system usually are accompanied by other benefits thathave a tremendous potential for boosting the bottom line.andM;For example, using the Logistics Expert System Advisor (LESA) fromIntellogistics of Columbus, Ohio, one can determine readily how tocost-justify a &quot;typical&quot; VAX expert system.andP;  (LESA is designed to assess thecosts and benefits of expert systems.)andM;In the case of a retailer with a MicroVAX and an inventory allocationproblem, an expert system would help determine how and when stock should bedistributed, using information stored in a database.andM;Such a system would be priced at approximately $829,000 and would have a lifecycle of six years.andP;  This expense would cover three man-years of developmenttime, including management overhead, the price of the expert system software,six years of maintenance and the expense of training users in the expertsystem application.andM;According to LESA, the cost benefits accruing from the increased efficiencyand accuracy would total $600,000.andP;  With the expert system in place, theretailer stands to reduce overstock, cut lost sales due to insufficientinventory and generate an improved cash flow that enables him or her tomanage money more efficiently.andM;Further calculations show that the estimated ROI would be a 0.7-to-1ratio--not, on the surface, a terribly persuasive financial argument.andM;However, if that proposed expert system were applied on a larger scale, sayfor a company with 10 times the inventory, size or turnover, the paybackwould increase substantially while incurring little in the way of additionalcosts.andM;Most of the expense centers on extracting and coding an expert's knowledgeinto the system, not in distributing the completed application or supportingit.andP;  The greater the value of the stock or the speed at which it is depletedand replaced, the greater the value accrued by the expert system without muchextra cost.andM;In the long run, an inventory-control expert system would be a much cheaperoption than the cost of mismanaged inventory or, alternatively, the expenseof employing people with the expertise to keep those costs in line.andM;If the actions of DEC and other companies in the area of expert systemstechnology are any indication of what's to come, users can well expectexponential returns from expert systems technology.andM;An internally developed application, DEC's Automatically Produced EngineeringSchematics (APES), signifies the approach many corporations will betaking--more sophisticated applications built on prior experience indeveloping expert systems.andM;The APES application can design 10,000 logic gates overnight, compared withthe 40-gate-per-day average of human engineers.andP;  It can produce 50,000applications per week and thus give DEC a six-month gain in productivity.andM;Industry players and analysis foresee expert systems becoming so prevalentthat the technology will play a strategic role in a company's business plan.andO;(See &quot;Expert systems market,&quot; page 46.)andP;  The technology may even become awidely accepted layer of computing based on the intelligent processing ofknowledge.andM;For the near term, more expert systems are likely to be packaged withdatabases as well as networking and imaging technology.andM;However, before expert systems technology can play an important role in thefuture of a business, the buyer has to start out small.andP;  The many returnsconceivable from an investment in expert systems can be thwarted by an overlyambitious project that loses money and turns personnel against thetechnology.andM;Carefully selected, manageable tasks that are replaced successfully withexpert system applications are the proper stepping stones for much larger,more complex and more rewarding expert systems to come.andM;Expert systems' payback takes timeandM;The benefit of an expert system become more apparent over time, according tothe most recent DR user survey.andP;  After three years of ownership, users puthigher profit margins and reduced staffing needs of the top of the list ofbenefits, whereas these two benefits were judged much differently byfirst-year owners of expert systems.andM;The survey was conducted for DR by Beta Research of Syosset, N.Y., andresults were drawn from interviews with a sampling of MIS managers at VAXsites who had bought, or are planning to buy, expert systems.andM;Whereas 55 percent of the third-year owners said higher profit margins are amajor benefit of their expert systems, only 28 percent of those who haveinstalled their expert system within a year agreed.andP;  Improved customerservice and increased sales were cited by 44 percent and 33 percent,respectively, of the third-year owners; just 28 percent and 14 percent of thenew owners recognized those beneficial factors.andM;Nevertheless, calculating the return on an expert systems investment proved adifficult task for many of the survey respondents.andP;  Twenty-three percent didnot know the price of the expert system hardware and software, another 23percent did not measure their ROI, and 32 percent said they did not receive areturn on their investment.andM;Not surprisingly, cost came up in the lower rungs of MIS managers' concemsabout expert systems.andP;  Nearly 66 percent of the respondents ranked responsetime as a major concern.andP;  The automated expert system's CPU consumption anduser interface also ranked well above cost as a major concern from 49 percentand 58 percent, respectively, of the MIS managers interviewed.andM;The survey indicated that the average expert system supports 25 users, incure$12,210 in training costs and has been in use for just over two years.andP;  Tocreate their expert systems, 66 percent said they had adopted the rapidprototyping method of development.andP;  Although the expert system shell seems tobe the wave of the future, traditional AI languages still held sway at mostVAX sites.andP;  Sixty-six percent of the respondents use Lisp, and 54 percent useProlog.andP;  Only 15 percent currently use a shell.andM;Expert system supercharges ROIandM;Powerup, a fictititous manufacturer of industrial power supplies, has emergedin recent years as one of the leaders of its industry.andP;  Its product qualityis consistently high, and its service and repair personnel are some of thebest in the business.andM;But to remain competitive, Powerup is trying to charge up its servicecapabilities.andP;  In this business, service is a critical feature of a productline.andM;Powerup's MIS manager thinks he has a way to address the issue.andP;  Tasks suchas maintenance and repair are well-suited to expert system applications, hethinks, and decides that now might be a good opportunity to bring expertsystems technology into the company.andP;  What the MIS manager plans is to useexisting expertise to automate the repair and maintenance of largegenerators, speeding up response time and improving sales.andM;After soliciting bids on an expert system on his own, the MIS manager settlesfor a $100,000 rules-based shell that will run on his VAX 6000-410 withouteating up too much CPU time.andP;  That, he knows, will be the least of hisexpenses.andP;  Development time will really drive up the cost.andP;  Thus, he plans todepreciate the system over a six-year period.andM;The MIS manager figures that in the first year he'll spend about sixman-months just developing a prototype.andP;  The initial charge will be about$30,000 for a knowledge engineer's time and overhead, as well as the domainexperts time.andM;In the second and third years, however, development costs will really beginto add up.andP;  The MIS manager calculates that in that time period approximately42 man-months will be required to develop a working rules-based system, acost he spreads over two years.andP;  The following two years, he estimates,maintenance will run approximately $16,000.andP;  His total development cost,then, is $267,250.andM;The MIS manager plans for the system to become operational in the third year,at which time he will begin to receive the benefits of the application.andO;Service, he figures, amounts to 30 percent of Powerup's bottom line, and hecalculates that the system will improve sales 100 percent.andP;  In this case, itamounts to a $300,000 increase annually.andM;Thus, his total net income over the six-year period will be $704,715.andO;Because of the development costs and the time it will take to put the expertsystem into production, his cumulative cash flow will not become positiveuntil the third year.andP;  But because of the large savings he expects to receivein the end, the present value of his investment will amount to $100,230, witha healthy internal rate of return of 21.3 percent.andM;Powerup's MIS manager knows that this application will continue to add valueover the years, as improved service continues to increase Powerup's sales.andO;And once he has some expert systems expertise in house, he has no doubt thathe'll find other experts to replicate.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
