Even for sensational serial murder trials, this one will haveunusual security for the unpredictable defendant, Richard Ramirez,who once yelled ``Hail, Satan!'' and flashed a demonic symbol incourt. Ramirez has been more subdued recently and taken to wearingblack clothing and sunglasses which he uses to peer at the crowd.   Trials here in recent years have included the ``HillsideStrangler'' case of Angelo Buono Jr., convicted of the sex slayingsof nine young women and girls, and the case of William Bonin,convicted of the ``Freeway Killer'' sex murders of 10 young men.   But Ramirez will wear leg shackles while seated in court. Andspectators entering the courtroom will have to pass through a metaldetector.   The precautions were put into effect last August when the leadprosecutor, Deputy District Attorney Philip Halpin, claimed Ramirezhad threatened to kill him in court with a smuggled gun then turn iton spectators.   Defense attorney Daniel Hernandez denied the threat, but the LosAngeles County Sheriff's Department said threats indeed had beenmade and established the strong security.   Ramirez, 28, a pale, shaggy-haired drifter from El Paso, Texas,is charged with 13 counts of murder and 30 other felonies, includingrape, robbery and attempted murder. He could receive the deathpenalty if convicted.   The charges stem from a 1985 summer crime spree in which anocturnal killer dubbed the ``Night Stalker'' entered homes throughunlocked windows or doors, raped women, killed both men and womenwith execution-style gunshot blasts to the head and stole jewelryand other valuables.   Prosecutors are anxious to begin testimony in the much-delayedtrial, which officially began with jury selection in July.Attorneys' opening statements are set for Monday morning.   The entire trial before Superior Court Judge Michael Tynan isexpected to take two years.   The most recent delay was caused by a controversy over the racialmakeup of the jury. The defense accused prosecutors of excludingHispanics and black women while the prosecution accused the defenseof excluding whites and Asians.   A 12-member jury of seven women and five men, comprised of sixblacks and six Hispanics, was finally chosen last week. There arealso 12 alternates.   Another late development was a report Thursday that a stateappellate court ruled that Ramirez's lawyer, Hernandez, failed tomeet professional standards in a previous murder case. The appellatecourt said Hernandez failed to adequately interview and subpoenawitnesses and failed to research the law, among other things.   Concerns by judges and prosecutors about Hernandez's competenceto represent Ramirez in the complex capital murder case havesurfaced several times, but he remains as counsel.   While the slayings were going on, fear swept the city. Gun salesand self-defense classes increased. Citizens shut their doors andwindows tight despite a 100-degree heat wave. The terror spread asthe crimes moved north to San Francisco and south to Orange County;Ramirez also is charged in both areas.   One victim's eyes were gouged out. Several women testified atRamirez's preliminary hearing in 1986 that after the killer murderedtheir husbands they were raped and ordered to ``swear to Satan.''   The killer often scrawled on walls drawings of pentagrams,inverted five-pointed stars commonly associated with devil worship.   During his 1985 arraignment, Ramirez fueled speculation that hewas indeed a devil worshiper when he yelled ``Hail, Satan!'' andflashed a pentagrammed palm in court.   He was arrested after he was chased and beaten by an angry EastLos Angeles mob during the 1985 Labor Day Weekend when he allegedlytried to steal a car. The same day, his picture appeared innewspapers as the prime suspect in the crime spree.</TEXT></DOC>
