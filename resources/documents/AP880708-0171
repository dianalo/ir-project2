As a result, the number of consultants and the total value oftheir contracts is likely to continue to be underreported, Derek J.Vander Schaaf told the Senate Governmental Affairs federal servicesubcommittee.   Vander Schaaf told the panel that the Pentagon recentlyoverhauled its administrative system for overseeing consultants,but that new regulations to implement the changes have not yet beenpublished and that ``field (audit) personnel had not beenadequately trained in the application of the consulting servicedefinitions.''   The General Accounting Office, a congressional watchdog agency,recently reported that the Pentagon spent $2.8 billion to $18.8billion on consultants in fiscal year 1987. The Pentagon reportedspending only $155 million.   Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., chairman of the subcommittee, agreedwith Vander Schaaf that part of the Pentagon's problem in trackingdown all its consultants is the definition of the term.Consultants, Pryor said, can be called ``contract employees'' or avariety of other titles.   The hearing did not focus on the ongoing criminal investigationof Pentagon fraud and bribery. That probe centers on allegationsthat defense contractors and consultants, many of them formermilitary men, bribed Pentagon officials for contracting detailsthat could be vital in winning contracts worth billions of dollars.   However, Pryor did say that he was angry about the Pentagon'shandling of its apparent procurement problems.   ``The Pentagon public relations machine is working overtime tominimize, dodge, shift blame and squirm,'' he said. ``They say thesystem is great.''   ``As a citizen, I'm not only outraged,'' he said. ``I'm ashamedas a senator for being a part of an institution that knows theproblem, but has been impotent to change it. I'm ashamed of us fornot standing on our desk tops and demanding some public hangings.''   Pryor's statement, in turn, angered Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska,the ranking Republican on the panel.   ``There's no reason to malign distinguished public servants,''Stevens told Pryor.   Part of the problem, Stevens said, is that ``the question ofwhat or what is not a consultant contract needs to be settled.''   Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., meanwhile, introduced a bill on Fridaythat would strengthen the position of undersecretary of defense foracquisition. The measure centralizes authority within that office,whereas all four services currently have wide-ranging authority tosign contracts.   ``We must do everything possible to correct the inherentinefficiencies of the current system and to reduce the potentialfor abuse,'' Dixon said.   Meantime, at the House Armed Service Committee, two formerPentagon acquisition officials differed about the need for newlegislation to fix the procurement system.   Richard DeLauer, undersecretary for research and engineeringduring the first term of the Reagan administration, opposed newlegislation.   ``If you would support (Defense Secretary) Frank Carlucci in thenext four months, and let him find out what's wrong with it, wecould make some changes,'' DeLauer said. ``He's got the muscle andis not afraid of stepping on toes.''   DeLauer described the system as ``sick'' and added, ``Don't askme to give it a grade.''   But James Wade, assistant secretary for acquisition in 1985-86,proposed that a law be passed to establish a single, civilian``defense acquisition corps'' with procurement authority over allthe services.   ``I think the bureaucracy fights change,'' Wade testified. ``Thesystem is failing and getting worse. We're not going to makestructural changes in the heat of a political campaign. Moretinkering at the margins will actually hurt the system.''   DeLauer also criticized former Defense Secretary CasparWeinberger, saying, ``Cap did not have an interest in reallyunderstanding in depth the whole procurement process. It was nothis interest and he did not understand it. And he delegated. Andunfortunately he delegated it to anybody who would pick it up.''</TEXT></DOC>
