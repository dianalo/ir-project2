On the basisof thermodynamic ratios the index of continuum adiabate is found, whichcan be calculated from entropy formulas at high pressure gradients. Three-velocity,three-temperature model of gas-liquid flow are considered. The modelis completed using the known and recently obtained ratios for the calculationof dynamic and thermal discrepancy of phases. Calculated and experimentalvalues for critical velocities and flow rates of gas-liquid, air-waterand steam-water flows are compared.</TEXT></DOC>
