<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-58-0021 </DOCNO><TEXT>A detailed cogeneration analysis has been conducted for the campus ofTexas A andamp; M University in College Station, Texas as a part of a studyto evaluate various cogeneration alternatives for Texas State agencies.The analysis used the CELCAP computer program (obtained from the Navy'sCivil Engineering Laboratory). Hourly steam and electrical loads wereused in order to size the cogeneration system. Other information requiredby CELCAP were the physical characteristics and efficiencies of the generationunits and the boilers; utility rates; operation and maintenance costsof the gas turbines, steam turbines and the boilers; and a calendar ofthe working and non-working days throughout the year. The CELCAP programwas run with the current campus cogeneration system to determine the1986 base case costs and to validate the campus model. An additionalbase model was developed using the current system and the new energyrequirements for the 1990-92 time period. Five different scenarios ofoperation of cogeneration systems were considered to determine the optimalsystem/operation for the present and future demands of this campus. A37.4 MW gas turbine-generator set with a waste heat boiler provided thebest economics for Texas A andamp; M. Both simple payback and net present valueeconomic analyses were performed for the recommended system.</TEXT></DOC>
