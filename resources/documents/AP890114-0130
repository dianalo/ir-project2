Chanting hymns, the first bathers on Saturday offered milk andflowers as the seven-week holy fair known as ``Kumbh Mela'' began.Millions are expected to take part.   ``It is something seen to be believed. It is something nearlyimpossible for us to understand,'' said Wade Dazey, an Americantourist who spent $1,500 to come from California to this centralIndian city to see the fair.   ``You can't see anything similar to this anywhere in the world,it is worth the money and time,'' said Dazey, a lecturer ofreligious studies at the University of California.   An estimated 30 million to 40 million people are expected tobathe at the confluence of the Ganga, Jamuna and mythical Saraswatirivers during the fair, which takes its name from a fight betweengods and demons over a pot of nectar.   Drops of nectar are believed to have fallen at the confluence,and Hindus believe a bath at the spot will give them salvation fromwhat they consider a long cycle of birth and rebirth.   ``Kumbh'' in Hindi means pot and ``Mela'' means fair.   The most auspicious time to seek salvation, according to theHindu faith, is when Jupiter is in Taurus and the sun and moon arein Capricorn, a configuration that occurs every 12 years.   The day did not begin on a auspicious note for a group of 50pilgrims who fell into the river Ganga when the two boats they werein capsized. There were no casualties, an official said.   Holy men dressed in saffron, scarlet, white and gold robes weregiven precedence at the bathing site.   They arrived on magnificent chariots pulled by followers, and onelephants and camels adorned with feathers, bells, ornaments andmarigold garlands. Brass bands playing popular music marched infront of the procession as the holy men blessed the throngs ofpeople waiting to take a dip.   Some of the holy men wore loincloths and others had only ashsmeared over their bodies. They bathed in temperatures as low as 43degrees, with their hair either shorn off or tied in knots overtheir heads.   The Nagas, holy men who live as naked recluses, were given evengreater precedence and bathed at dawn.   The logistics of the holding the fair almost defy comprehension.   At least 11,000 police officers are constantly on duty to monitorthe 3,000-acre fair area, according to Jagannath Dwivedi, the chiefadministrator of the event.   The police regulate the movements of bathers and attempt to easetensions between rival sects of holy men, who have been known to usetheir spears and lances against each other.   ``There is always tension and you never know when a minor clashwill snowball into a battle,'' Dwivedi said.   Naval divers patrol the river front to prevent pilgrims fromdrowning.   Special attempts are made to keep pilgrims moving steadily toavoid stampedes, he said. At least 800 pilgrims died at the fairheld in 1954, and 50 were trampled to death in 1986 at a similarfair in the city of Hardwar, upstream on the Ganges.   Hardwar and the cities of Ujjain and Nasik are other places inIndia where Hindus believe drops of heavenly nectar had fallen, butthe Allahabad fair is considered the best.   Arrangements to park 200,000 vehicles and 5,000 boats have beenmade and authorities have run 400 special trains to bring pilgrimsto the city, Dwivedi said.   Sprawling canvas tents have been erected to accommodate themillions of pilgrims who will participate in the fair.   About 13,000 gallons of milk, 10 tons of butter and 5 tons ofcheese will be supplied to the pilgrims daily. Authorities havestocked 10,000 tons of wheat, 4,000 tons of rice and 2,000 tons ofsugar for distribution, Dwivedi said.   Consumption of meat and liquor is banned at pilgrimage centersduring Hindu festivals.</TEXT></DOC>
