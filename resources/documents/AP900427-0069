The party newspaper said two-thirds of the new members are underthe age of 35 and have at least high school educations.   The report did not give the current party membership. Anofficial of the party Organization Department, contacted by phone,said, ``I know but I won't tell you.''   Figures published more than a year ago put membership at about48 million, 4 percent of China's population.   The party launched a review of the qualifications of all partymembers following the crackdown last June of the democracymovement. Many party members either participated in or voiced theirsupport for the student-led movement for democratic reform.   So far, it appears few are being dropped from party ranks forideological shortcomings. The People's Daily last month said 33,400people were expelled from the party last year for abuse of power orother reasons, up slightly from previous years.   The daily said there were 9.51 million pending applications bythe end of 1989, and that there were 2.32 million new applicationsafter the political turmoil of June.   In deciding whether to accept someone into the party, officialsconsider whether the applicant submits to the party line and partydiscipline and has good moral character. They also check theapplicant's personal and family background for such things ascriminal records or accusations of political errors.   The daily said 5.3 million of the pending applicants wereworkers, farmers, herdsmen, fishermen, intellectuals and soldiers.The other 4 million are presumably government officials, who needparty membership to advance their careers.   Despite widespread disenchantment with the party, many youngpeople still see party membership as crucial to obtaining good jobs.</TEXT></DOC>
