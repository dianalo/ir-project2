The two said they have waived financing conditions, but that the offer still depends on 50.1% of the shares being tendered and on the redemption or invalidation of the Randolph, Mass.-based doughnut chain's poison-pill rights. The two are seeking to overturn those takeover defenses through a lawsuit scheduled to proceed Sept. 11 in the Delaware Court of Chancery. Legal proceedings are to begin Sept. 11. Unicorp, a holding company with interests in financial services and oil and gas, and Cara, a food services concern, said their offer expires Sept. 15.    Dunkin' Donuts said its board will meet with legal and financial advisers to evaluate the revised offer. And it urged holders to defer a decision on tendering shares until it makes its recommendation.    Barry Ziegler, CL Global Partners Securities Corp. analyst in New York, estimates the chain's market price at $43 to $46 a share. He termed the bid &quot;fair.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
