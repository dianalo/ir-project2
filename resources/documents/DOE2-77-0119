We find that,although the superlattice peak intensity decreases a thousand fold overthe range studied, the integrated intensity, and hence the structurefactor, is nearly constant. This indicates that the surface undergoesan order-disorder transition with little change in the magnitude of theatomic displacements. The critical behavior is compared with predictionsof the 2D XY and Ising models.</TEXT></DOC>
