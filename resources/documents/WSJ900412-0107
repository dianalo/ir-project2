Now lawmakers are worried that the regulators are beingtoo hard in New England and other parts of the country.</LP><TEXT>   The difference is the fear that a credit crunch isbeginning to choke off lending. And the result is that someon Capitol Hill are accusing regulators of overreacting andperhaps even pitching the economy into recession.   &quot;I think the experience of Texas looms too large,&quot;complains Rep. Barney Frank, a Democrat from hard-hitMassachusetts. He says he has been deluged by complaints frombankers and borrowers about regulatory excess. &quot;Theregulators tell me they are erring on the side of safety,&quot;says Rep. Frank, who sits on the House Banking Committee. &quot;Idon't think they should be erring at all.&quot;   Says William Isaac, a former chairman of the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp. who is now a bank consultant: &quot;Thependulum is swinging too far in the other direction. Weneeded to tighten up, but I am concerned we're tightening uptoo far, too fast.&quot;   The prime target of these complaints is Comptroller of theCurrency Robert Clarke, whose examiners have stirred much ofthe controversy by picking apart commercial real-estateportfolios in New England's banks. Mr. Clarke, a soft-spokenHouston banking lawyer, isn't backing down. He points to the$243 billion thrift bailout as the justification for hisagency's aggressive examinations of banks.   &quot;The shareholders and the public who have paid and willpay for {the thrift} mess have sent a pretty strong messagethat they don't want to do it again,&quot; Mr. Clarke told abankers' convention last weekend.   Mr. Clarke insists his agency hasn't tightened the rules.Rather, he argues, when an economic slowdown hits, &quot;the oldrules produce different results.&quot; With office vacancy ratesclimbing in New England and the region's economy weakening,Mr. Clarke says, it's only prudent for banks to &quot;adjust thefine-tuning knob&quot; in evaluating loans, particularly thosemade to real-estate developers. He argues that the strongapproach taken in New England is a model for financialregulation in the 1990s.   But prudence has a price. For example, since last fall,when Mr. Clarke's examiners began scouring New England realestate portfolios, three major New England banks have setaside a total of more than $2 billion in reserves forpotential loan losses. That capital could have been used toback as much as $30 billion in loans to the region's flaggingeconomy, says the chairman of one of the banks, Joel Alvordof Shawmut National Corp. Now, small businesses of all kindsare complaining that credit is harder to get. Examiners aresimilarly peering over the shoulders of nervous bankers inthe Southeast and other parts of the country.   Some critics argue that Mr. Clarke's office has backedinto making monetary policy by draining liquidity from thebanking system. Indeed, Federal Reserve Board Chairman AlanGreenspan and others at the Fed are known to be concernedthat examiners might go too far or that bankers mightoverreact by curtailing credit too severely. Mr. Greenspan isunderstood to have personally conveyed this concern to Mr.Clarke.   Officials of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currencysay the big reserves taken by New England banks are a sign ofpast banker mistakes, not of regulatory overkill. KarenWilson, newly appointed deputy comptroller for the Northeast,says many banks have failed to update property appraisalsthat may be from three years ago, before values began toslide. In some cases, loans were made without any recordedappraisals at all. Too many banks were counting on a risingmarket to hide sloppy practices, she asserts.   Tight competition bred loose standards. At one big NewEngland bank, the comptroller's office says, the average loanofficer oversaw 110 commercial loans involving 60 differentcustomers. &quot;Nobody can keep up with 110 loans,&quot; says StephenSteinbrink, a top official in the comptroller's office whohas been coordinating the extra examiners shipped to theNortheast.   Many analysts, bankers and accountants concede thatlending mistakes were made, but still insist that regulatorshave reacted too harshly. They point in particular to theregulators' insistence that banks declare as nonperformingcertain loans that still are being serviced and set asidefunds to cover potential losses on those loans. The practicehas even created a new term, the &quot;performing nonperformingloan.&quot;   Even if the lending rules haven't changed, banks areoperating in a highly charged atmosphere created by thethrift mess. Last summer's thrift-bailout law vastly expandedregulators' enforcement powers. Regulators flexing their newmuscles have given bankers the jitters.   For instance, the FDIC recently slapped a tiny bank inEdna, Kan., with a $9,600 fine -- more than a tenth of thebank's annual income -- for filing a quarterly report twoweeks late. Only after Kansas Sen. Robert Dole raised thematter on the Senate floor did the FDIC agree to reduce thefine; the new amount hasn't been settled. But that isn'tlikely to calm bankers worried about fines that can hit $1million a day under the thrift law.   Despite Sen. Dole's intervention, bankers are learningthat friends are harder to find on Capitol Hill these days.The rules may not have changed for banks, but they certainlyhave for Congress: Every member is aware that the SenateEthics Committee is investigating the &quot;Keating Five&quot; senatorswho interceded with regulators on behalf of the now-defunctLincoln Savings andamp; Loan Association.   But it's easier for lawmakers now that the focus hasturned to the potential economic effects of regulators'exams. Last month Sen. Christopher Dodd, a ConnecticutDemocrat and a member of the Banking Committee, held a publicsession back home at which he worried aloud that examinersmight be applying the lessons of Texas to New England withouttaking into account differences between the two regions.Unlike the oil-patch states, &quot;We're not an economy based on asingle industry,&quot; he told Ms. Wilson of the comptroller'soffice. He also raised the possibility that regulators couldcreate a &quot;self-fulfilling prophecy&quot; of tumbling real estatevalues as banks scramble to foreclose and sell properties.   Ms. Wilson denied that her agency's examiners are doinganything more than making banks recognize the deteriorationthat has already taken place in the market.   Last week Rep. Joseph Kennedy (D., Mass.) held a similar-- but closed-door -- meeting at the Federal Reserve Bank ofBoston. &quot;There's tremendous concern about being tainted withthe Keating Five,&quot; says Mr. Kennedy. &quot;But I'm not arguing onbehalf of a specific bank. I'm trying to find out what'sgoing on with our economy.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
