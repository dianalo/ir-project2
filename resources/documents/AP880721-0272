The 31-count federal indictment handed down Wednesday accusedRobert Chestman, 41, of Lawrence, N.Y., of using confidentialinformation about the impending merger from a client distantlyrelated to Waldbaum Inc.'s founder.   Charges against Chestman, a senior vice president, include mailand securities fraud counts, and one count of perjury for allegedlylying under oath to the Securities and Exchange Commission that hedid not receive inside information about Waldbaum.   Keith Loeb, who is married to the niece of Ira Waldbaum, settledan SEC civil suit last October by agreeing to pay $45,307 in finesand alleged illegal profits stemming from the acquisition.   Wednesday's indictment did not name either Loeb or Gruntal.   Gruntal officials said they had no immediate comment on thecharges, although a spokesman said Chestman would continue to beemployed by the firm, a unit of the insurance holding company HomeGroup Inc., during the proceedings.   Chestman's attorney, Otto Obermaier, told the New York Timesthat his client would fight the allegations.   ``Mr. Chestman vigorously denies that charges that have beenmade,'' Obermaier said. ``We are distressed that this matter hasescalated to the point of filing criminal charges.''   U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani said that in late Novermber1986 Chestman bought 11,000 shares of Waldbaum stock for himselfand nine clients, including members of the Waldbaum family, afterlearning from Loeb that the company was about to be sold to Aandamp;P at$50 a share. Chestman kept 3,000 shares for himself, he said.   Waldbaum stock had been trading over the counter for between$23.50 and $24.75 a share, but after the merger was announcedpublicly about a week later it jumped to around $49 a share,Giuliani said.   ``The SEC noted suspicious trading in the stock and commenced aninvestigation,'' Giuliani told a news conference. He said hisoffice and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service later were calledinto the investigation.   Giuliani said the case was especially significant because thealleged illegal trading occurred less than two weeks after the caseof former stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky was made public. The twocases were not connected, he said.   Boesky paid the SEC a record $100 million to settleinsider-trading charges and was sentenced last December to threeyears imprisonment on a single felony count of conspiring to lie tothe SEC. Boesky's cooperation with federal investigators has sinceled to several other indictments.   In addition to the perjury count, the grand jury indictment ofChestman includes 20 counts of securities fraud and 10 counts ofmail fraud.   Each of the counts carries a maximum penalty of five years inprison and a fine of up to twice the total gain from thetransactions.   Chestman is scheduled to be arraigned on the charges July 28.</TEXT></DOC>
