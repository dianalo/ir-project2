Commission Chairman Wendy L. Gramm testified before the SenateAgriculture Committee, which said an FBI investigation involving twoexchanges in Chicago ``raises fundamental questions about thefutures regulatory system.''   Congress is considering legislation to reauthorize the commissionthrough 1994, extending its authorty to enforce federal futures andoptions trading laws.   A future is a contract to buy or sell a commodity at a specifiedprice on a given date. An option is the right to buy or sell acommodity for a specified price at some time in the future.   The House and Senate agriculture committees have jurisdictionover the CFTC. The committee chairmen say reauthorization wasexpected to be a brief process but reports of an FBI investigationinto alleged fraud and illegal trading on Chicago futures marketsmade a congressional inquiry necessary.   The bureau's probe reportedly involves allegations that brokersand traders cheated customers out of millions of dollars in deals onthe Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade.   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who heads the Senate committee, saidthe panel wants to know how well the CFTC enforces the lawsregulating U.S. futures and options exchanges and how it can be surethe 14 exchanges do an adequate job of self-policing.   ``The results of the not-yet-complete Chicago investigation mayprovide new information as to the effectiveness of existing programsupon which changes can be based,'' Mrs. Gramm told the committee.   However, she said no program can detect every instance ofwrongdoing, particularly when it occurs off the trading floor.   ``The commission believes that its existing regulatory authorityshould be sufficient to discharge its responsibilities to protectthe integrity of U.S. futures and options markets,'' Mrs. Gramm said.   ``To the extent that any improprieties or abuses found in thecourse of the ongoing investigation warrant changes in the existingprograms, systems, or rules, the commission has publicly stated thatit stands ready to take such actions as may be appropriate toaddress those circumstances,'' she added.   Leahy ordered the CFTC, within 30 days, to submit an analysis of12 proposals made to tighten oversight of exchange floors.   ``The committee has not yet judged the wisdom of any one of theseapproaches, nor do we prejudge the outcome of the Chicago probe,''he said. ``Our goal, rather, is to begin the focus of public debateon tangible reforms aimed at maintaining confidence in themarketplace.''   Among the proposals were requiring exchanges to devote moreresources to floor surveillance, and increasing penalties fortrading abuses.</TEXT></DOC>
