VENEZIA</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   For the first time, Atlantic City'scasinos are being allowed to use the Miss America Pageant almost asa publicity prop. But the contestants still cannot set foot on thegaming floors during pageant week.   The contest rulebook describes the contestants as ``young ladieswho exemplify the integrity of American youth,'' and it was on thatbasis that the pageant never let the gaming halls get involved inany of the publicity.   The casinos were mostly outsiders to the pageant festivities,not allowed to do much more than provide rooms for the women anddecorate floats for the parade.   But things have changed.   Casino logos now will figure prominently in many photographstaken during this year's pageant week.   Entertainer Merv Griffin, who is in the middle of a deal to buyResorts International, was host at a reception Friday night for thecontestants and posed with all 51 under a giant Resorts logo toppedwith a crown.   On Saturday, casino owner Donald Trump invited contestants to bephotographed aboard his opulent yacht, the Trump Princess. In themorning, contestants posed for a pool shot underneath a large TrumpPlaza sign.   The Sands and Del Webb's Claridge casino hotels also jumped onthe bandwagon, bringing in Miss America 1988, Kaye Lani Rae Rafko,to cut the ribbon to a small museum exhibit at the entrance to thetwo gaming halls' people mover, a moving sidewalk that carriescustomers in from the boardwalk.   The move to include casinos in the pre-pageant publicity camewith the appointment of Leonard Horn as the pageant's new executivedirector. He succeeded veteran Albert Marks, who retired earlierthis year.   ``Casinos are the only major industry in Atlantic City and havebeen very good to the Miss America program,'' Horn said.   ``But I found out that many of the casinos felt that whilethey've been good to us, we've never given them the opportunity toutilize the Miss America Pageant.''   They're utilizing the pageant now, and the atmosphere's changing.   Friday night's reception, for instance, was a rare opportunityfor the 51 women to be seen in an atmosphere of drinking, smokingand even some suggestive jokes.   ``Send them in _ this is a buffet tonight,'' Griffin said,rubbing his hands together in mock anticipation as the contestantsentered.   Of course, the contestants and their hostesses were not servedany alcoholic beverages with their meals, although waiters pouredwine for anyone next to them.   And they can't gamble during during pageant week, not even ifthey're 21, old enough legally.</TEXT></DOC>
