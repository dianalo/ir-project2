Itis the objective of this study to demonstrate through the irradiationof uranium standards by measurement of short-lived fission products howeach mode of activation is best utilised. Application of CAA to the problem,in order to enhance signal-to-noise ratio, must also take into accountan increasing dead-time with each cycle and therefore mass fractionationof a given sample and standard are investigated for replicate and pseudo-cyclicactivation conditions. The variation of timing parameters in the cyclicmode, and irradiation in a mixed reactor flux and epicadmium neutronflux, produces a set of equations from which half-life can be determinedto confirm fission product identification in these complex gamma-rayspectra.
