<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-44-1143 </DOCNO><TEXT>Recent advances in optical technology for digital computation are examinedin reviews and reports. Consideration is given to direct and associativeoptical computing, optical AI and optical expert systems, optical/electroniclogic and D/A systems, and optical interconnects. Topics discussed includesymbolic substitution using ZnS interference filters, binary logic byspatial filtering, a directed graph optical processor, computer-visionapplications of associative networks, decomposition of digital switchingfunctions, variable-accuracy optical matrix/vector processors, CMOS detectorcells for holographic optical interconnects in microcircuits, and S/Nsimulations for small guided-wave optical networks.</TEXT></DOC>
