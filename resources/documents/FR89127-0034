That program is described in 45 FR 68586, datedOctober 15, 1980, and involves a comprehensive review of the OCC's rules,policies, procedures and forms governing filings for corporate expansionand structural changes for national banks. The goals of the CARE programare to minimize costs and burdens on applicants, the OCC, and the public;to provide a better understanding of OCC policies; to modify or eliminaterules, policies, procedures and forms which are unnecessary or lead toinefficiencies; and to remove barriers to competition.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion</ITAG>Operating SubsidiariesThe operating subsidiary regulation (12 CFR 5.34) currently permits a nationalbank to acquire or establish an operating subsidiary or perform new activitiesin an operating subsidiary after 30 days from the date it notifies theOCC of its intentions. However, the 30-day period may be extended by theOCC if the bank's letter raises issues that require additional informationor analysis. If the time period has been extended, the bank may not performthe new activities in an operating subsidiary until the OCC provides writtenapproval authorizing such activities. The OCC uses the 30-day (or longer)time period to determine if the proposed activities are legally permissiblefor a national bank and to review the proposal for consistency with safeand sound banking practices. Where warranted, the OCC addresses legal orsupervisory concerns by imposing conditions on the performance of the newactivities in its written approval.In the past, the OCC relied on its general authority to ensure the safeand sound operations of national banks, referred to in 12 CFR 5.34(d)(3),as the basis for imposing conditions on operating subsidiary activities.The proposed rule states plainly that the OCC may issue a written approval,subject to conditions, where legal or supervisory concerns are present,which are enforceable as conditions imposed in writing within the meaningof 12 U.S.C. 1818(b).Time FramesThis proposed rule also amends 12 CFR 5.24, 5.46, and 5.47 by limitingthe time between OCC approval and consummation of conversions, changesin equity capital, and issuances of subordinated debt. The proposed ruleestablishes time limits of six months for conversion transactions and 12months for the issuance of subordinated debt and changes in equity capital.Approvals will automatically expire for transactions that are not consummatedwithin the time limits, unless the OCC grants an extension.The new time limits are consistent with OCC policy and practice for othercorporate filings. Also, experience indicates that the time limits exceedthe time taken by virtually all applicants to consummate those transactions.Therefore, the automatic expiration period will not affect most applicants,but will allow the OCC to purge abandoned filings. Extension of the timelimit can be granted in unusual circumstances. OCC efficiency thereforewill improve without any significant additional burden on applicants.Equity InvestmentsThis proposed rule also adds a new andSection; 5.36, which requires notificationto the OCC of certain proposed equity investments which are authorizedby statute. The proposed rule operates in the same manner as 12 CFR 5.34,including proposed amendments, with regard to operating subsidiaries.Investments would be approved, disapproved, or approved subject to supervisoryconditions. The OCC believes that its duty to ensure the safety and soundnessof national banks under 12 U.S.C. 1818(b), as well as its general supervisoryauthority over national banks under the National Bank Act, 12 U.S.C. 1<T3>et seq.</T3>, are adequate legal authority to impose these supervisoryrequirements.While national banks are presently permitted by statute to make a numberof equity investments, the OCC finds it unnecessary at this time to requirenotice for every type of investment. Most investments are routine and havelittle danger of affecting a bank's safety and soundness. Some, such asEdge Act corporations, are adequately supervised by other regulatory agencies.Accordingly, the proposed rule is limited to equity investments in nonbankdepository institutions and agricultural credit corporations, as well asany equity investments which may be authorized by statute in the future.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act  </ITAG>Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354,5 U.S.C. 601) it is certified that this notice of proposed rulemaking,if adopted as a final rule, will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 </ITAG>The OCC has determined that this proposed rule is not classified as a ``majorrule'' and therefore does not require a regulatory impact analysis.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>The collection of information contained in this notice of proposed rulemakinghas been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget under controlnumber 1557-0014 for review in accordance with the Paperwork ReductionAct of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)). Comments on the collection of informationshould be sent to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Officeof Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, attention: Desk Officerfor Comptroller of the Currency, with copies to the Comptroller of theCurrency, Legislative and Regulatory Analysis, 5th Floor, 490 L'EnfantPlaza East, SW., Washington, DC 20219. The collections of information in this regulation are in 12 CFR 5.24, 5.34,5.46, and 5.47, and proposed new andSection; 5.36. This information is requiredby the OCC to render decisions on the permissibility of proposed activitiesfor operating subsidiaries, the safety and soundness of proposed equityinvestments, and to purge abandoned filings for changes in equity capital,subordinated debt, and conversions. This information will be used to assistthe OCC in fulfilling its responsibility for maintaining the safety andsoundness of national banks and the national banking system, and to improveOCC efficiency. The likely respondents are for-profit institutions. No burden change is expected for andSection;andSection; 5.24, 5.34, 5.46, or5.47. Additional burden is imposed by proposed andSection; 5.36, Other EquityInvestments. OCC is requesting only the minimum amount of information necessaryto review the proposed investment. For andSection; 5.36, OCC estimates that 10 responses will be received annuallyand that each response will require approximately four hours to prepareand submit. The burden on respondents should not vary considerably becauseof differences in bank activity, size, or complexity. Further, the informationrequested is the same information that prudent bank management and directorswill have reviewed in conjunction with their analysis of the investment.The total burden increase attributable to andSection; 5.36 is expected tobe approximately 40 burden hours. If this proposed rule is adopted as a final rule, the total number of responsesattributable to OMB Control Number 1557-0014 will be 2,950 and the totalburden hours will be 47,613. This reflects 10 additional responses and40 additional burden hours for 12 CFR 5.36.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 5 </ITAG>National Banks, Banking, Corporate Activities, Operating Subsidiaries,Conversions, Equity Capital, Equity Investments, Subordinated Debt.<ITAG tagnum="84">Authority and Issuance </ITAG>For the reasons set out in the preamble, Part 5 of Chapter I of Title 12of the Code of Federal Regulations is proposed to be amended as set forthbelow:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 5_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1.
