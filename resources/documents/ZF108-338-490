 The new systems offer more bang for the buck in price/performancelevels and more configuration flexibility than current models.andM;The additions expand Data General's reach into new application environments,one prime area being software development.andP;  With a new total of 15 systems,the Aviion family now includes the AV 400 series of midrange graphicsworkstations, the AV 4000 servies of entry-level server or multiuser systemsand the AV 5200/6200 series of high-end servers.andM;The 10 systems incorporate Data General's newest edition of its DG/UXoperating system, version 4.2.andP;  Among the operating system enhancements arethe addition of the Open Software Foundation's Motid graphical userinterface; the DG/AVlib, the company's graphics library for Aviion systems;and new Systems Network Architecture (SNA) software packages to enhanceconnectivity with IBM machines.andP;  The systems are binary compatible withprevious models.andM;Data General's workstation line now adds four AV 400 computers to the currentfour AV 300 systems.andP;  The AV 400 series offers more expansion andconfiguration flexibility by providing two VME slots and user-installable8-bit, 24-bit or 24-bit Z-buffer graphics processors.andP;  Symmetricmultiprocessing enables users to process tow-dimensional andthree-dimensional graphics applications.andM;The four AV 400 models are equipped with one or two 16-7-megahertz Motorola88000 chips or one or two 20MHz 88000 chips.andP;  Computing performance rangesbetween 17 Dhrystone benchmark MIPS and 20 Dhrystone MIPS.andP;  Additionalcomponents include 8 megabytes of memory, an integrated Ethernet controllerand a high-resolution color monitor.andP;  Two models, the AV 400 and the AV 402,are available 45 days after receipt of order, and prices start at $9,500 and$12,500, respectively.andP;  The AV 410 and AV 412 models are available in June,starting at $36,890 and $43,890, respectively.andP;  Optional 8-bit and 24-bitcolor graphics are available for prices ranging betwee $4,000 and $9,495.andM;The AV 4000 models are suitable for use as either multiuser systems orentry-level server systems.andP;  Available in the same physical deskside cabinetas the AV 400 systems, the AV 4000 and AV 4020 models each contain a 16MHzMotorola 88000 chip.andP;  Basic system features are similar to those for the AV400 workstations, but memory may be expanded to 32MB, and mass storage can beexpanded up to 2.5 gigabytes.andP;  Processing at 17 Dhrystone MIPS, the systemscan be used for time-sharing and server applications by an average of 15 to40 users.andP;  Available 45 days after receipt of order, the AV 4000 and AV 4020start at $17,000 and $25,545, respectively.andM;For users who need more power than the current AV 5010 Model, Data General isoffering the AV 5200, which increases processing power by 5 millioninstruction per second without increasing the price.andP;

 But, says Momentum, the native IPC facilities between the operatingsystems often have different features, thereby making it difficult forprogrammers to develop and port applications.andP;  Momentum's new package, calledExtended Interprocess Communication Facilities (XIPC), is designed tocoordinate the varying operating system features, thus enabling softwaredevelopers to make applications consistent across the various operatingsystems being used.andM;XIPC consists of three components--a semaphore system, queue system andshared memory system--each acting independently of one another and each ableto have multiple, separate, simultaneously active instances serving differentapplications.andP;  The software tools are available for the following operatingsystems: Microsoft and IBM OS/2, SCO XENIX, IBM AIX, SunOS, DEC ULTRIX andDEC VAX/VMS.andP;  XIPC works by serving as an on-line monitor of all resourcesand activities and as an interactive debugger, which traces operations anddefines break points on specific conditions.andM;Momentum notes that XIPC performs a variety of functions as an interactivemonitoring facility.andP;  Monitoring can be done in four modes including aninterval snapshot mode, in which a display is refreshed at user-specifiedtime intervals; a trace step mode, in which the display is refreshed afterevery XIPC operation; a trace flow mode, which combines the functionality ofthe interval snapshot and trace step modes; and a trace log mode, whichprovides a complete log of XIPC operations for output on a disk or printer.andO;In addition to monitoring capabilities, among a host of other features areshell and batch access, source code portability, trap and signal services,blocking options, multiple process notification, and even and resourcesemaphores.andM;A single-developer XIPC license starts at $1,495.andP;  MOMENTUM SOFTWARE CORP.,andO;Saddle Brook, N.J.andM;Enhanced AccountingandM;From CYMAandM;CYMA, a subsidiary of World-Wide Technology Inc., has introduced version 2.0of its Professional Accounting Series (PAS), a seven-module series that runson DOS and XENIX.andP;  CYMA says it has made enhancement consistent in eachmodule, including improved scanning capabilities, which allow the user tosearch and look up information (such as vendor numbers or general ledgeraccount numbers), and a new relational report writer feature, which lets theuser go outside each module and tie different files together to generate areport.andM;In addition, the accounting program allows users to build customerinformation files for storing specific data about clients.andP;  Otherimprovements in individual modules include automatic consolidation of generalledgers and the ability to generate and maintain a transaction history in thegeneral ledger module.andP;  The PAS version 2.0 includes general ledger, accountspayable, accounts receivable, payroll, inventory and order processing, jobcontrol and system manager.andP;
