This paper addressesthe viability of soluble silicates reducing hydroxide consumption bysiliceous rock reactions. A convenient differential rate method is usedto obtain new experimental kinetic data for the dissolution/condensationrates of quartz at 23 and 70{sup 0}C [73 and 158{sup 0}F] and amorphoussilica at 23{sup 0}C [73{sup 0}F] over the pH range from 11 to 12 and1 M NaCl. The role of added silicates is studied from zero solution concentrationto considerably above the solubility limit. Silica dissolution ratesare observed to slow as the solubility limit is reached and become negative(i.e., net precipitation occurs) above the solubility limit. The kineticrates decrease with increasing solution silicate in a parabolic fashion.Most important, the solubility limit of quartz (amorphous silica) controlsthe deposition rate of quartz (amorphous silica) over the range of pHvalues and temperatures investigated. That is, crystalline quartz growsdirectly on solid quartz particles, rather than deposition of amorphoussilica with subsequent alteration to the crystalline habit. This meansthat relatively small amounts of soluble silicates, approaching the solubilitylimit of quartz, can protect against hydroxide consumption by quartziticrock reactions. A molecular dissolution/condensation reaction schemeis proposed, based on equilibrium adsorption of unionized silicic acid.With this reaction path, a mathematical model is developed that agreesquite well with the measured kinetic rate data.</TEXT></DOC>
