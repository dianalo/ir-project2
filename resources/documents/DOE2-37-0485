At the same time an existing 150/10 kV-substation has beenrenovated entirely and a new 150/10 kV-substation has been built. Bothin primary and in secondary equipment modern technology was applied.Concerning primary apparatus e.g. SF/sub 6/- and vacuumcircuit-breakers,metaloxyde H.V. surge arresters, aluminium busbar-systems and XLPE-cablecould be mentioned. Secondary functions with the exception of the protectionare carried out by a microprocessor based system for station-control.An optical fibre system provides the data exchange between the substationsand with the remote control centre.
