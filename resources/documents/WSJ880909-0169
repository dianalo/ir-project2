Separately, Lloyd's said higher insurance rates for offshore oil rigs may offset massive losses expected from Occidental Petroleum Corp.'s Piper Alpha platform disaster last July. Lloyd's also announced decreased 1985 profit of #211 million ($358 million), down 24% from #279 million in 1984.    Murray Lawrence, Lloyd's chairman, said the market is reviewing &quot;the possibility of a move from unlimited liability towards some form of limited liability&quot; for its investors. This could result in the world's largest insurance market adopting a corporate structure, in which investors are liable for losses only up to the amount of their investment.    Unlimited liability is Lloyd's hallmark. The 33,000 investors -- known as members or &quot;names&quot; -- risk all their personal assets in return for lucrative premium and investment income. U.S. investors account for about 10% of the members.    A change in this system, which would require Parliamentary approval, isn't imminent, Mr. Lawrence emphasized. He also expressed skepticism about its implementation. And he declined to discuss the options involving limited liability that are part of a review expected to be completed early next year.    But for tradition-bound Lloyd's even to consider such a change is a major step. Lloyd's has been under government pressure to remedy inadequate protection for investors in the self-regulated market. Threatened with the kind of regulatory legislation imposed recently on other British financial-services institutions, Lloyd's already has implemented recommendations made last year by a government panel.    Recent big underwriting losses by Lloyd's investors undoubtedly have played a part in the recent decline of their numbers. Mr. Lawrence said about 1,300 members have indicated they will resign this year, and that number is expected to rise to about 1,700. He maintained the resignations stemmed from a variety of factors, including changes in market conditions and tax laws.    The market's underwriting capacity shouldn't be affected because about 1,000 new members are expected to join and some existing members plan to increase their underwriting commitments, the Lloyd's chairman continued.    At the same time, Lloyd's said it is raising investors' financial requirements. Beginning in 1990, new members must prove they have personal assets valued at #250,000 ($424,000), up from the current #100,000.    Lloyd's also said greater competition in the insurance industry will curtail profit in the near future. And in the area of marine insurance, the fatal fire on Occidental Petrolum's North Sea rig &quot;adversely affected the 1988 account substantially,&quot; according to Christopher Rome, chairman of Lloyd's Underwriters' Association, a market group. The Lloyd's market will absorb roughly half the estimated $1.4 billion in losses from the Piper Alpha disaster, he said.    But Mr. Rome said the disaster actually could have a &quot;beneficial effect in 1989 because of the substantial chance that rates will increase&quot; for offshore oil-rig coverage.    Mr. Rome said he hoped the cease-fire in the Gulf War between Iran and Iraq will reduce the big underwriting losses from the war. He noted that premiums for ship hull insurance already have fallen to roughly 5% of the value of the hull for a six-month policy, down from as much as 30% several months ago.    Mr. Lawrence said the storm that battered France and southern England last October likely will prove to have caused the world's largest insured loss ever. Claims are estimated to total at least $3 billion, dwarfing previous claims for U.S. hurricanes.    In its 1985 results, Lloyd's reported that profit on underwriting activities rose to #190 million from #138 million in 1984. Premium income rose to #3.05 billion from #2.96 billion. But total profit fell because underwriting firms earned less money on their investments. Profit from investments, which continued to be the biggest contributor to earnings, fell to #373 million from #432 million.    Lloyd's reports its results three years late to account for the filing of claims and litigation. Profit represents the aggregate results of about 375 syndicates backed by investors. These members underwrite policies in return for premiums, which they then invest. </TEXT></DOC>
