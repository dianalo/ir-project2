Digital made the claim Tuesday in announcing a major thrust inthe field of transaction processing, a burgeoning computer industrysegment in which IBM so far has dominated Digital.   Digital President Kenneth Olsen called transaction processing``the fastest-growing part of the business computer market'' andvowed to grab a bigger part of it. Analysts said the goal wasrealistic.   IBM, meanwhile, brought out three more powerful models of its RTworkstation and an improved version of DOS, the operating systemused on its original line of personal computers.   Transaction processing is the kind of computing done by banktellers, airline reservation clerks and other people who need tointeract closely with computers. It is gradually shoving asidebatch processing, in which a computer churns through reams of workwithout interference.   Digital said tests of its new systems showed they could processtransactions for less than one-third the cost of IBM and half thecost of Tandem Computers Inc.   IBM said it had not seen Digital's claim and could thus notimmediately respond.   David Dempsey, manager of corporate product marketing forTandem, said, ``I'm not worried. It was an apples for orangescomparison.''   The worldwide market for transaction processing, $20 billion to$30 billion a year, probably will double in five years, a Digitalexecutive told Datamation magazine earlier this year.   IBM is the clear market leader in transaction processing,accounting last year for 48.5 percent of the systems installed atalmost 7,000 minicomputer sites across the country, vs. 6.6 percentfor Digital, according to a survey last summer by Datamation andCowen andamp; Co.   Other rivals for Digital are Unisys Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co.,Tandem and Wang Laboratories Inc.   But the products announced Tuesday could help even the score forDigital. Digital unveiled a range of services and products,including software, monitors and data-storage devices, that makeits existing line of computers better at transaction processing.   ``Digital has been in transaction processing for a long time,and is among the largest suppliers to the market,'' Olsen said in awritten statement. ``But our customers are asking us to do more.''   Craig Symons, an analyst for Gartner Group in Stamford, Conn.,said Digital's offerings are unusually strong because they areeffectively knitted into the company's existing product line.   Symons said Digital seemed to be accurate in its claims aboutits cost advantage against IBM. But he said IBM's disadvantagewould lessen somewhat through the use of a new version of its DB2data-base management software.   IBM said all three new models of its RT workstation use aprocessor that provides up to 25 percent better performance thanthe processor used in their predecessor. The computers are intendedmainly for science and engineering, although IBM says they can alsobe used for general business.   In the personal computer area, IBM had promised last year tokeep improving DOS even after it introduced its Operating System-2,but this was the first evidence of it. Also Tuesday, IBM announceda July 29 availability date for the extended edition of itsOperating System-2, which bundles together various communicationsand data management features.   IBM and Microsoft Corp. simultaneously introduced the newversion of DOS, which has easy-to-use screen features such as menusand graphics. The version, named DOS 4.0, can also handle largerdata files and more main memory. The price is $150, or $95 forpeople upgrading from an older version of DOS.</TEXT></DOC>
