Under the plan, nearly $1.5 billion in frozen Iraqi fundscould be used to pay for the destruction of Iraqi weapons byU.N. teams, to fund some war reparations owed by Iraq, and toprovide food and medicine for Iraq's people. The money wouldcome from oil payments that were in Iraqi bank accounts whenit invaded Kuwait in August 1990. About $600 million of thefunds are in the U.S., and at least the same amount isavailable in other nations, according to a U.S. official.</LP><TEXT>   In another sign of the Bush administration's impatiencewith Iraq's refusal to comply fully with U.N. resolutions,officials said that Pentagon planners have been told toupdate and refine contingency plans for providing U.N.inspection teams with armed helicopter escorts or using othermilitary force to ensure destruction of Iraqi missile-makingfacilities and other weapons of mass destruction.   These officials emphasized that President Bush hasn't madea final decision about whether to resort to force, and theU.S. isn't likely to take unilateral military action.Nevertheless, stepped up discussion about military options --both inside and outside the Pentagon -- reflects theadministration's escalating anger and determination to endthe stalemate with Saddam Hussein. Some officials suggestedthat a resolution could come within a few weeks.   On the Iraqi frozen assets, discussions are under way withother members of the U.N. Security Council about passing aU.N. resolution authorizing use of the assets for reparationsand humanitarian purposes and U.N. activities. But there alsois a lively debate within the Bush administration about theplan. It is opposed by Treasury officials, who have legalconcerns about such use of the assets, but is being pushed atthe State Department and elsewhere in the administration,according to the senior U.S. official.   The overall frustration over Iraq's lack of compliancewith U.N. resolutions was raised again last week when IraqiDeputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz addressed the U.N. andrefused to &quot;fully and unconditionally&quot; comply with SecurityCouncil resolutions, according to a U.N. statement.   Attention is focusing on the frozen assets because of aU.N. resolution that expires this week. It permits Iraq tosell $1.6 billion of oil under U.N. supervision, but earmarksmuch of the funds for U.N. operations, reparations, andpurchases of food and medicine. The Security Council isexpected to renew the resolution, but the expiration dategives U.S. officials the opportunity to underscore that Iraqhas thus far refused to sell oil under the U.N.'s terms, andso U.N. inspection and weapons-destruction operations havebeen funded by U.N. members.   U.S. officials said that using frozen Iraqi assets to fundthese activities would send an important message to Baghdad.&quot;It says, our patience is up. If you're not prepared to moveon {these activities}, we're prepared to look at other waysof doing it,&quot; said the senior U.S. official.   The Treasury reportedly is concerned that such use offrozen assets could damage the legal cases of Americancompanies and individuals who have claims outstanding againstIraq. But other U.S. officials, who advocate tapping frozenIraqi accounts, believe they have a solution. They say thatthe Iraqi frozen funds could be &quot;borrowed&quot; by the U.N. andrepaid to Iraq once it decides to start pumping its oil.   The possibility of a show of force against Iraq, perhapsincluding air raids targeting its remaining weapons-making ornuclear research facilities, gained credence in the past fewdays from various signs. British Foreign Secretary DouglasHurd and Russia's ambassador to the U.S., for example, bothsaid they would support military action if that was the onlyway to make sure Iraq's most dangerous weapons and militaryfacilities are eliminated.   Meanwhile, another important test of U.N. resolve andIraqi compliance will come within the next few weeks, whenU.N. teams are expected to go to Iraq to inspect and then tryto destroy ballistic missile-making facilities and what isbelieved to be a major nuclear weapons facility at al Atheer.If these teams fail to gain full access to such facilities orthe Iraqi regime continues to balk at destroying themachinery they contain, some U.S. officials believe thatcould prompt the White House to make an all-out push for sometype of U.N.-sanctioned military action.   Last week, the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Americasailed through the Strait of Hormuz into the Persian Gulf forwhat Pentagon officials insisted was a routine exercise. TheU.S. already has formidable air power in Saudi Arabia andelsewhere in the region, but the Navy's move seems calculatedto underline U.S. resolve while warning Baghdad that someU.S. military options don't require the use of Arabairfields.</TEXT></DOC>
