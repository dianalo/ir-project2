The roar spookstheir horse and scatters the hens across the barnyard.   NATO warplanes skimming over trees, farms and villages in mockbattles have been a common sight in West Germany for years.   Airmen from seven nations in the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization, including West Germany, take part in a total of70,000 low-level training flights in this country each year, morethan in any other NATO land, according to the West German DefenseMinistry.   But thousands of West Germans now are saying they've had enoughof it.   ``I know the defense of our country is important, but theselow-level fliers are annoying,'' said the 56-year-old Buschmann,whose farm is just outside Borken near the Dutch-West German border.   ``Those jets are really a nuisance, and the animals don't caretoo much for them either,'' said his wife.   On one recent day, about 50 military jets were in the air overthe Borken area, many of them in low-level maneuvers.   Opposition to the low-level flights soared after two recentcrashes. On March 30 a French fighter jet crashed near a nuclearpower plant in Bavaria. A day later, a U.S. F-16 plummeted into aWest German town, destroying homes and killing a resident.   About 60,000 West Germans belong to grass-roots organizationspressuring the federal government to do something about low-levelmilitary flights, activists say.   West Germans complain such flights give them nightmares, impairtheir hearing, cause high blood pressure and make their childrenirritable.   ``I get these very ugly dreams,'' said Daerbel Stechel, a45-year-old activist who lives in Wischhafen near Bremen and hearsNATO jet fighters screeching overhead nearly every day.   ``In one of them, I'm swimming in a very beautiful lake andsuddenly jet fighters are falling all around me into the water.This is very bad,'' she said.   Earlier this year, the respected Wickert Institute polled WestGermans and found that 15 percent want NATO to stop its low-levelmilitary training flights.   Two-thirds of the 1,710 people polled said such flights werenecessary but that the number should be reduced, the institute said.   ``Most people who oppose these flights are not members of theGreens (West Germany's environmentalist party), but just citizenswho cannot stand the noise any longer,'' said Udo Rinner, a45-year-old engineer and activist who lives in Muenster.   ``For example, I am a conservative and am vehemently against thelow-level flights.''   The low-level runs, in which the warplanes fly at altitudes aslow as 250 feet, are limited to seven areas less densely populatedthan other parts of the country. Five areas are in the north halfand two in the south.   Forty percent of the low-level flights are by the West Germanair force, said Ruediger Jaeschke, a spokesman for the West GermanDefense Ministry.   The remainder are flown by Americans, British, Dutch, French,Canadians and Norwegians, he said.   All NATO flights in West Germany are coordinated by a WestGerman air force's control center in Porz, which is between Cologneand Bonn.   The NATO allies refuse to divulge how many warplanes are basedin West Germany, which is temporary home to about 900,000 foreignsoldiers.   Jaeschke said the low-level flights are important for NATO'sdefense of West Germany.   He added that NATO is considering a ``midday break'' of a couplehours a day when the jets would have to stay on the ground.   In addition, he said, the NATO allies are always looking for newtechnological means to soften the jets' roar.   ``Much has been done in the last few years to lower the level ofthe noise from the jets,'' Jaeschke said.   But he strongly rejected activists' views that low-level flightsshould be stopped.   The Warsaw Pact, the Soviet bloc's defense alliance, has anumerical advantage over NATO in several areas, Jaeschke said. ``Ifour pilots train too little, the Warsaw Pact advantage becomesgreater.''   U.S. Air Force authorities also say low-level training flightsare necessary.   ``They are required to provide realistic training to NATO aircrews,'' Maj. Gen. Richard Pascoe, commander of the 17th Air Forceat Sembach Air Base near Kaiserslautern, said.   ``We must train the way we expect to fight.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Mon PMs May 30</NOTE></DOC>
