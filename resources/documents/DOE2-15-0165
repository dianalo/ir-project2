The model incorporates a one-dimensionalradial transport code, parallel velocity Fokker-Planck calculation, anda toroidal ray tracing code. For steady LH current drive it is foundthat the RF current generation is accurately predicted by a fast electronconfinement time of the form tau/sub L/=tau/sub 0//sup (+-)/{gamma}/sup3/, with tau/sub 0//sup (+-)/=3ms in the density range of 3x10/sup 19/m/sup-3/ andless; or approx. n-bar/sub e/ andless; or approx. 7x10/sup 19/m/sup -3/ (where+- distinguishes electrons moving parallel (antiparallel) to the currentdrive direction). Also in this range, the theoretically predicted waveabsorption and experimentally measured electron temperatures and storedenergy were found to be consistent with an electron thermal diffusivitywhose magnitude is independent of n/sub e/. To reproduce the experimentallymeasured values of LH rampup efficiency at n-bar/sub e/=3x10/sup 19/m/sup-3/, it was necessary to take tau/sub 0//sup (+-)/=3ms. For LH heatingat densities of n-bar/sub e/ approx.= 1.4x10/sup 20/m/sup -3/, the powerlost due to collisional damping of the LH ray trajectories at the plasmaperiphery was found to be significant, because of higher edge densities.Studies of LHRF sawtooth stabilization experiments with RF current driveindicated the possibility of creating stable profiles of the safety factor,q, via the generation of positive RF current near the q=1 surface, thusproducing a current 'pedestal'.
