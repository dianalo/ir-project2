Scale lengths are typically16 pc, and velocity modulation amplitudes 1.5 km/s. These are interpretedas velocity waves which are probably tightly coupled to, or even resonantwith, magnetic field line vibrations. These waves dominate the turbulencewithin the region. It is suggested that these strange kinematic propertiesare related to the mysterious origin of Gould's belt. 22 references.</TEXT></DOC>
