Thursday announced a breakthrough in fiber optic transmissionsystems for local telephone networks that could sig- nificantly speed thecompletion of all-fiber, broadband services networks in the United States andabroad.andM;Raynet's new LOC-2 (Loop Optical Carrier) commercial system is said todeliver the performance, reliability and enhanced services capability offiber optics for the same cost as new copper telephone facilities, therebymaking fiber in local telephone net- works a cost-effective reality.andM;The LOC-2 system brings fiber to the &quot;local loop,&quot; the last mile of thetelephone network between phone company central offices and subscriber homesand businesses.andP;  The LOC-2 system uses a resource-sharing architecture and aunique fiber optic coupler to eliminate the cost penalties associated withinstalling fiber in local telephone networks.andM;The system supports a variety of cable topologies to accommodate a wide rangeof neighborhood layouts.andP;  Supporting software makes the system operationallycompatible with existing telephone networks.andP;  The system is modular,providing easy incorporation of AM video and SONET-based BISDN servicecapabilities as demand for them develops.andM;The Raynet LOC product family has been in development for over three years.andO;Prototype systems are now operational in two field trials.andP;  The LOC-2 systemwill be ready for shipment to first in- stallations in the fourth quarter of1990.andM;CURBSIDE PEDESTAL The Raynet LOC-2 fiber-in-the-loop system brings the fiberto a small curbside pedestal.andP;  From the pedestal, copper wires dis- tributeservice to individual homes.andP;  With this fiber-to-the-curb strategy, telephonecompanies can provide access to the benefits of fiber optic communicationswithout installing a separate fiber and costly electronics for eachsubscriber.andM;&quot;While long distance telephone service has been converting to fiber foryears, the required cabling, lasers, and optical receivers have been tooexpensive to implement in local telephone networks,&quot; said Dr. Edward Davis,president and chief executive officer of Raynet.andM;&quot;Raynet's LOC-2 system is the first truly cost-effective solution forbringing fiber-based services to everyone, and it can be in- stalled withouta telephone service technician having to dig up a homeowner's lawn.andM;&quot;Because the LOC-2 system can be installed for the same cost as copper wire,local telephone operating companies, which have been anxious to replacecopper lines with fiber, can now afford to do it.&quot;andM;Optical fiber is recognized as a superior medium for telephone servicebecause a single fiber can carry thousands of conversa- tions with muchimproved signal quality.andP;  The LOC-2 system uses a bus architecture orvariants of the bus, like PON (passive optical network), to deliver fiberservice to the curbside pedestal (which house the electronics) at pointsalong the public right of way.andM;From the pedestal, existing copper telephone lines to connect to the home.andP;  ALOC-2 system can support up to 384 telephone sub- scribers over just a fewpairs of fibers, thereby sharing the cost of the fiber and electronics among384 subscribers.andM;Costs of telephone installation vary widely.andP;  New copper installa- tions aretypically $1,200 - $1,500 per line.andP;  The variation in rehabilitation costs iseven greater.andP;  Because of its efficient architecture, the installed cost of aLOC-2 system will generally be equal to or less than the cost of new copperinstallations.andM;The immediate use of the LOC-2 system will be to carry telephone service.andO;Because fiber is so well suited to digital signal trans- mission, the LOC-2system will also support Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) servicesas they become available within the next few years.andM;In addition, the high capacity of the system's fiber will enable it todeliver enhanced services, such as AM video, high speed data transmission,and when demand develops, SONET-based 622 megabit per second broadband ISDN(BISDN).andP;  This upgrade to full BISDN is accomplished by the addition of apassively coupled fiber all the way to the subscriber's residence and theaccompanying electronics.andM;Raynet's LOC-2 system is the first fiber-in-the-loop system to in- clude acomplete operations support system, called RIDES, provid- ing softwaremanagement of the telephone network.andP;  The RIDES sys- tem can enable atelephone subscriber who requests an additional line to receive immediateactivation of the new line.andM;RIDES also monitors the performance of the network and alerts the telephonecompany to problems as they occur.andP;  Since the telephone company does not haveto wait to be notified by a customer, problems can be fixed more quickly,often before the subscriber's telephone service is affected.andP;  These softwarecapabilities will reduce the lifetime operating costs of the LOC-2 systembelow cop- per costs.andM;DEVELOPED BY BELLSOUTH Developed by BellSouth Enterprises in cooperation withRaynet, the RIDES system interfaces the LOC-2 fiber network with existingtelephone company administration and support systems.andP;  This inter- faceallows telephone personnel to perform operations support functions withoutsubstantial additional training.andM;Field trials of both telephone and cable television are currently underway,using Raynet's LOC-1 system.andP;  In the United States, NYNEX Corp. and NewEngland Telephone Co. are conducting the world's first trial of a sharedresource fiber distribution sys- tem, serving some 100 homes in Lynnfield,Mass., with a Raynet LOC-1 system.andP;  Ameritech and its Ohio Bell operatingcompany are scheduled to begin a Raynet trial, initially involving 72 homes,this spring in Columbus, Ohio.andP;  Other U.S.andP;  trials are planned for this year.andM;In Cologne, West Germany, the Raynet system is being used to dis- tributeboth telephone and cable television signals to a community of about 200subscribers.andP;  The trial is being conducted by the Deutsche BundespostTelekom, the government agency that ad- ministers both telephone and cabletelevision service for West Germany.andM;This trial is also a first; the first use of a shared resource system todeliver video signals.andP;  The shared resource approach makes fibercost-effective for providing cable television service.andP;  In addition, theRaynet system provides excellent signal quality, without &quot;ghosts&quot; seen onmany coaxial copper cable television sys- tems.andM;Founded in 1987, Raynet is a subsidiary of Raychem Corp.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
