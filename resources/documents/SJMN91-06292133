Some of the sevenchallengers jumped into the race after April, when Chancellor Thomas Fryer andthe trustees said they first learned of the financial crisis.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  AUDIT FUELS CHALLENGERS IN FOOTHILL-DE ANZA RACE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Election 1991  </MEMO><TEXT>     &quot;The heat is really on the incumbents,&quot; said one of those challengers, taxpractitioner William Zipp, at a candidates forum this week. &quot;It's easier to bea challenger this time.&quot;;   Others on the ballot are: James Gonzales, astudent; Mary Mason, a paralegal and former board member in the MountainView-Los Altos Union High School District; Judith Moss, an administrator withthe San Francisco Community College District and former Mountain Viewcouncilwoman; Stanley Mount, a writer and counselor; Dolores Sandoval, aneducator and community volunteer; and Matthew Cusimano, a businessman.Cusimano was unavailable for comment this week, and it is unclear whether heis still in the race.;   The Coopers andamp; Lybrand audit places primary blame onformer business director Jack Mason, saying he submitted incorrect andmisleading figures to the trustees and chancellor. But it also stated that theboard, chancellor, campus presidents and many managers should share someculpability. The trustees, uncomfortable with budget processes, relied tooheavily on district managers, the report concluded.;   The incumbents saythey've learned from the situation. &quot;We were fooled by someone who set out tofool us,&quot; Bacchetti, a vice president for planning and management at Stanford,said in an interview. &quot;I'm not likely to be easily fooled again.&quot;;   Theboard, Smithwick said, must &quot;be more careful in evaluating people, and ensurethat the information is trustworthy.&quot;;   He said the problem &quot;wasn't thatevident. It's clear that we could have (discovered it earlier), as could havea lot of people, from the chancellor down,&quot; perhaps by comparing variousfiscal reports over time. &quot;We asked the right questions in meetings, but wedidn't get the right answers.&quot;;   But Mary Mason, who is not related to JackMason, said: &quot;I don't think the current board has asked enough questions. . .. The board has to be able to ask hard questions, and ask for information in acertain way, so it understands it.&quot; She said the trustees could have caughtimproper fund transfers, but said &quot;there's been no misdoing on the part ofthis board, other than possibly complacency.&quot;;   &quot;The board of trustees becametoo comfortable with their role in the district, and allowed themselves tobecome surprised,&quot; agreed Gonzales, who was a student trustee in the districtfrom 1988 to 1989.;   Jack Mason's figures showed the total general fundrising steadily from 1988 to 1990, from $5 million to $9.5 million to $11million. (Outside auditors said it went from $5 million to $12 million, thenfell below $5 million last year). The supposed million-dollar increases shouldhave been a red flag, Moss said: &quot;One should question why is there more moneyavailable -- when we see throughout the state . . . that education is having arough time.&quot;;   &quot;The bottom line is lack of communications -- horizontally,vertically, whatever direction you want,&quot; said Mount, who worked and taught atFoothill and is an advocate for paralyzed veterans.;   But for all thecriticism of the board, it's been politely above board. There has been nopublic sniping at Bacchetti and Smithwick.;   &quot;I'm not running against theincumbents,&quot; Sandoval said at a forum, saying she decided to run in March,before the budget problems were revealed. Sandoval, who was a student trusteein 1984-'85, said, &quot;I'm not running for or against Tom Fryer.&quot;;   Thechancellor, the audit said, had a shoot-the-messenger reputation that silencedany whistle-blowers. The report recommended that Fryer be evaluated by thetrustees and cultivate open communication within the district.;   Most of thecandidates say they are not calling for Fryer's ouster, or have no position onit yet. &quot;You learn one lesson when you get burned. I think that's the casewith the chancellor,&quot; Gonzales said.;   Mount, though, favors his removal.Jack Mason resigned, but Fryer remains -- which Mount says is akin to &quot;alwaysfiring the butler when the silverware's missing.&quot;;   The incumbents say theboard has moved swiftly to remedy things. It managed to pull the 1990-'91budget back into the black through layoffs, halting capital spending, a bondsale and other measures, Smithwick noted. It has established an auditcommittee and started to implement the audit recommendations. A biannualevaluation of the chancellor will be &quot;rigorous, which is the way he wants itand the way we want it as well,&quot; Bacchetti said.;   They argue that a crisisis precisely when experience -- their experience -- is needed. Smithwick, aretired dentist, said he had not planned to run again, but after April, &quot;Ifelt my continuation would be in the district's best interests.&quot;;   Bacchettisaid there is too prevalent an attitude that &quot;people ought to pay formistakes, rather than learn from them.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  BARBARA KOH, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Peninsula/Am  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911018  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  887  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, October 18, 199100292133,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
