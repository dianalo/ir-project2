The compounds are isostructural; monoclinic cell parametersare: sp. gr. C 2/m, Z=2:ZrCl/sub 4/x2Py: a=14.482, b=7.424, c=7.210 Aradical, {beta}=115.6 deg; TiCl/sub 4/x2Py: a=14.170, b=7.265, c=7.196A radical, {beta}=115.6 deg. The compound thermal stability is studied,melting and sublimation temperatures are determined. Monocrystal x-raydiffraction analysis is conducted for TiCl/sub 4/x2Py. The compound IRspectroscopy investigation is performed: band decomposition characteris considered in 250-600 cm/sup -1/ region for complexes of differentconfiguration and the trans-structure of the complexes studied is ascertained.</TEXT></DOC>
