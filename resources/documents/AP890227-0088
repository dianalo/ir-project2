(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Information exchanged by 20 law enforcementofficers familiar with serial killer Ted Bundy will be analyzedfurther to see if other crimes can be linked to him, the FBI saidtoday.   ``Information exchanged at the conference will be used to build amodel of homicides typically committed by Ted Bundy,'' the FBI saidin a statement after a weeklong meeting of Bundy investigatorsended. ``This model will be compared against crimes that areunsolved in which he remains a suspect.   Bundy was executed Jan. 24 in Florida for the 1978 murder ofKimberly Diane Leach of Lake City, Fla.   In the days before his death, Bundy confessed to 23 killingsacross the West, although he did not provide 23 names, and also gaveinformation that authorities said might linke him to other cases. Hehad been convicted of three killings in Florida.   Some investigators believe the onetime law student who becameAmerica's most notorious serial killer have slain more than 100women as far back as two decades ago.   The FBI said the goal of the conference was to determine thescope of Bundy's activities.   ``A chronological listing of his travels and activities will becharted by the FBI Visual Investigative Analysis Unit,'' the FBIstatement said. ``This process will consist of a detailedexamination of police records from around the country.''   FBI Special Agent William Hagmaier, who was present with Bundy atall of his interviews with investigators and was the last lawenforcement official to speak with the serial killer, said hebelieved conference participants came away with some usefulinformation.   ``Some people were brought in who had not had an opportunity totake confessions but were familiar with his crime scenes,'' Hagmaiersaid. ``We're discussing his methods of operation and hiswhereabouts in various cases to determine the practicality ofconsidering him a suspect.''</TEXT></DOC>
