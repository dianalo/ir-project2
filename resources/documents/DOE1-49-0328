These subjects have naturally occurring cellularmosaicism as a consequence of X-chromosome inactivation. Because theG6PD locus is on a portion of the X chromosome that undergoes inactivation,only one of the two genes that determine the structure of the enzymeis active in each XX somatic cell. Investigations with this system indicatethat many human neoplasms develop clonally. Results of studies with G6Pdof the myeloid leukemias have been reviewed previously. In this workthose data are updated and results of similar studies of acute lymphoidleukemias are presented. Four points are emphasized: human hemopoieticneoplasms develop clonally;chronic myeloid leukemias and related myeoproliferativedisorders involve pluripotent stem cells;acute myeloid leukemias areheterogeneous in the pattern of differentiative expression manifestedby the involved progenitors and in the nature of remissions, and humanleukemias probably have a multistep pathogenesis.</TEXT></DOC>
