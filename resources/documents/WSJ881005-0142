Emshwiller (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> VON </CO><IN> TOB RFD </IN><DATELINE> LOS ANGELES  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A controversial state toxic substances law is beginning to show its teeth as one of California's largest supermarket chains yesterday began removing certain tobacco products that lack health-warning labels.    Vons Cos. is pulling off its shelves cigars, pipe tobacco and loose tobacco used in roll-your-own cigarettes. A spokeswoman for the El Monte, Calif.-based chain of 352 supermarkets said manufactured cigarettes and smokeless tobaccos aren't affected because they already carry federally mandated warning labels.    The Vons spokeswoman said the company was pulling the products in an effort to comply with Proposition 65, a citizens-sponsored initiative that took effect earlier this year. The measure provides that the public be warned of any products that contain toxic substances in amounts deemed to present a significant risk of causing cancer and birth defects.    The action by Vons adds pressure on tobacco companies to add labels to these products, probably nationwide since it would be almost impossible to do it for just California. The action by the supermarket chain also indicates the potential effect Proposition 65 can have on the marketing of products generally in California and, perhaps, the nation.    Tobacco products are only the first round in a fight between industry and backers of Proposition 65 over what constitutes compliance with the law's provisions. Firms have largely been trying to comply by posting general warning signs in retail outlets and a toll-free phone number that consumers can call to ask questions about specific products.    Proposition 65 supporters argue that approach is inadequate and that warning labels on specific products are needed. Recently, the California attorney general filed suit against several tobacco companies and retailers, including Vons, for noncompliance with the law.    The Vons spokeswoman said her company's action wasn't prompted by the state's lawsuit. She said Vons had been discussing the matter with manufacturers for months.    A spokesman for the attorney general said the state welcomed Vons's action, but he declined to comment on what impact it might have on the suit.    Tobacco industry officials couldn't be reached for comment.    As previously reported, another major supermarket chain, Safeway Stores Inc. of Oakland, Calif., announced it will stop selling cigars and other tobacco products in California, effective Oct. 17, unless they carry warning labels.    Vons has also sent letters to other suppliers asking for assurances that products being sent to the supermarket chain don't contain significant amounts of substances covered by Proposition 65. If a product does, Vons is asking that a warning label be added. The Vons spokeswoman said the firm doesn't believe any other products will need to be removed from shelves.    David Roe, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund and an author of the initiative, said he expects more companies to be following Vons. Tobacco products represent &quot;the first shoe dropping,&quot; he said. &quot;The next shoe is all the other products.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
