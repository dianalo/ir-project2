Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev told a news briefingin Moscow: ``The situation is not improving. It has become evenmore threatening.''   Authorities imposed a 9 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew in Stepanakert,the main city of the Nagorno-Karabakh region, center of the disputebetween Armenians and Azerbaijanis that's been going on sinceFebruary. Violence in the region this week killed one person andhurt 48.   Protesters, who want the area to be taken from Azerbaijan andmade part of Armenia, attacked the city's prosecutor's office inStepanakert Thursday.   ``There are soldiers on every street, at every crossroad,checking passports and personal cars,'' said a man who answered thetelephone at the state radio and television office, Gostelradio, inStepanakert.   Nagorno-Karabakh, in the Caucasus Mountains, was virtually at astandstill and sealed off because of ethnic tension.   In Yerevan, capital of the Armenian republic, about 700,000people flooded the streets for a three-hour rally Thursday nightdespite heavy presence by police and thousands of soldiers, saidresident Arpine Popoyan.   The Foreign Ministry closed Azerbaijan to foreign journalistsThursday, a day after barring travel to Armenia. It gave no reason.   Asked the mood of Armenians, Mrs. Popoyan's 17-year-old son,Vahagen, replied: ``Fighting.''   Dozens of tanks and armored personnel carriers were deployed andsoldiers guarded government and Communist Party buildings inYerevan, Mrs. Popoyan said by telephone.   ``It's very tense. Everyone is at the edge,'' she said.   She said several deputies of the Armenian Supreme Soviet, therepublic's parliament, agreed at Thursday's rally to push again foran emergency session to renew demands to annex Nagorno-Karabakh. Arally was set for Friday and Armenians vowed to pursue theirgeneral strike until they get an answer, she said.   Armenian authorities on Wednesday refused to hold such a session.   State-run television showed armored personnel carriers inYerevan and said similar measures were taken in 16 other areas ofArmenia with a ``mixed population,'' apparently meaning areas whereboth Armenians and Azerbaijanis live. Armenia has a population of3.4 million.   The official news agency Tass said a strike that began inYerevan Sept. 16 spread to three other towns and an entire districtof the republic.   An editor for Armenia's official news agency, Armenpress, whodemanded anonymity, said food stores were open in Yerevan, butpublic transportation was not working and many people were on thestreets.   Perfiliev said one man was killed and 48 people were hurt thisweek in clashes in Nagorno-Karabakh, which has been part ofAzerbaijan since 1923 despite its historical links to Armenia andmostly Armenian population.   He said the dead man and 32 of the injured were Armenians. Theother casualties were Azerbaijani. Perfiliev reported beatings,mauraudings and more than 30 buildings burned down.   Perfiliev blamed it on ``corrupt elements'' trying to distractattention from Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms.   ``Such a situation, of course, cannot be tolerated ...,'' hesaid. ``The alternative was to take urgent and tough measures.''   In Tbilisi, a city 1,000 miles south of Moscow, dozens ofuniformed police manhandled Georgian nationalists Thursday whenthey tried to protest near the site of a U.S.-Soviet citizensconference. Activists said at least 15 demonstrators were detained.   Although Stepanakert was under a curfew, most people stayed homevoluntarily because they feared more violence, said the man atGostelradio, who refused to give his name.   Mrs. Popoyan's husband, Armenian activist and former politicalprisoner Rafael Popoyan, said from Yerevan that soldiers patrollingStepanakert had permission to search houses at will. Mrs. Popoyansaid Stepanakert residents, kept from going out on the streets,shouted from their windows in protest Wednesday night.   The man at Gostelradio said food stores, the newspaper and radioand television stations were operating, but public transportation,schools and most workplaces in Stepanakert were closed. He said nodemonstrations were held because of a ban and few people were onthe streets.   The Armenpress editor said protesters rallied Thursday morningin Yerevan, but ``there isn't any disorder, and there won't be.''   Radio Moscow said protesters attacked the regional prosecutor'soffice in Stepanakert, but did not say when.   ``There were also arson attacks. Several cars were put on fire.Shooting was heard in several places. These and other illegalactivities claimed casualties. Law enforcement agencies took stepsto put an end to mass-scale disorders,'' it said.   Tension rose markedly in Nagorno-Karabakh after a shoot-outSunday in Khadzhaly, near Stepanakert, killed one man and woundedat least 25 people.</TEXT></DOC>
