He is running against Peres of theleft-leaning Labor Party in the Nov. 1 election.   Hussein spoke Thursday night in an interview on ABC-TV's``Nightline'' program. Alon Liel, Foreign Ministry spokesman, saidtoday the appearance was engineered by Peres to show Israeli votershis ``peace plan still has a partner.''   Peres' peace plan calls for convening an international MiddleEast peace conference that would launch direct talks among theparties to the conflict. Palestinians would be represented by ajoint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation.   The proposal, initially accepted by Hussein, suffered a severesetback when the monarch announced July 31 he was severing tieswith the occupied West Bank, thus removing himself from the peaceprocess.   In the first segment of the ``Nightline'' program, Peresreiterated his proposed plan. Hussein, asked by anchorman TedKoppel to respond, called Peres' proposal ``interesting'' and ``astep forward.''   Jordan is ``prepared, if the Palestinians seek it and ask uscategorically, to go to an international conference in a joint(Palestinian-Jordanian) delegation,'' Hussein said.   The monarch also said a Shamir victory would be an ``absolutedisaster'' and escalate tensions in the Middle East.   Shamir refuses to trade territory for peace and proposes tonegotiate limited Palestinian autonomy in direct talks, a planrejected by Hussein.   Liel confirmed Koppel's on-the-air statement that Hussein'sappearance was engineered by Peres staffers who told ``Nightline''producers that Peres wanted to spell out his peace plan and thatHussein would respond favorably.   ``It was an important move to explain to the Israeli public thatthe international peace conference and the territory-for-peaceformula are realistic ideas,'' Liel told foreign reporters afterscreening the ``Nightline'' program for them.   Liel acknowledged the move could cause a backlash among voterswho might resent attempts by foreign leaders to manipulate them.``Peres definitely took into consideration that such a move wouldbe controversial,'' Liel said. ``But he wanted to show that hisprogram still has a partner.''   But Shamir suggested the ploy would harm Peres' chances in theelections. ``Those responsible for this attempt will bear fullpublic responsibility for their actions,'' Shamir said in astatement.   Likud and Peres are running neck-and-neck, according to thelatest polls.   Liel said that while Hussein's remarks did not containsubstantive changes, he made a shift in emphasis. ``In July,Hussein said, `If things change, I might come back into thepicture.' Now he says, `If the Palestinians would like, I will comeback,''' Liel said.</TEXT></DOC>
