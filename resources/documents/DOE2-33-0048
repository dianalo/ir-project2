<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-33-0048 </DOCNO><TEXT>The authors have calculated gain spectra and gain-current relations forGaAs-AlGaAs quantum well lasers using a model which incorporates a phenomenologicaldescription of bandgap narrowing due to many-body effects at high injection,transmission broadening by a carrier-density-dependent intraband scatteringprocess, and broadening of the density of states function by fluctuationsin the well width. The justification for including all these phenomenais made by examining spontaneous emission spectra observed through contactwindows on quantum well layers. Using reasonable values of the parametersdescribing these effects, the model predicts correctly the observed lengtheningof the laser emission wavelength with respect to the absorption edgeand correctly describes the variation of this wavelength, which theyhave observed for a set of devices with different numbers of quantumwells and the same well width. For a single GaAs quantum well laser 25A wide, with the same parameters, the model predicts an increase in thresholdcurrent by a factor of 2.5 compared to an ideal quantum well withoutthese effects.</TEXT></DOC>
