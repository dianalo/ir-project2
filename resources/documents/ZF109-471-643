 But if Windows is a well-furnished living room.andP;  DOS is still in thebasement, and installing a program often reflects that 10-year-oldfoundation.andM;Programs designed with Windows in mind, such as Aldus Corp.'s PageMaker,Microsoft Corp.'s Excel and Precision software's Superbase, are easier toinstall and use than conventional DOS programs.andP;  Most Windows productsinclude an installation routine, which the user simply runs from either theDOs command line or with the Run command in the File menu of the Windows FileManager or Program Manager tools.andM;Typical installation programs copy needed files to a hard-disk directory andadd an icon to the Program managerhs &quot;Windows Applications&quot; group to allowthe user to run the program with a convenient double-click.andM;If no installation routine is supplied, the installation process requires afew more steps.andP;  Files must be copied from the distribution disks to thedesired hard-disk directory, either graphically (by dragging icons in theFile Manager) or by keyboard commands from a Windows &quot;DOS Prompt&quot; session.andM;Iths then convenient to put an icon for the program in one of the ProgramManager's &quot;groups&quot;--typical groups might be Newsletter, Budget and so on.andO;Each group appears as an icon, which opens into a window that in turn showsan icon for each program.andM;There are three ways to add an icon to the Program Manager.andP;  The easiest iswith the Windoes Setup program, which scans the hard disk for applications itrecognizes.andP;  Any programs earmarked as Windows programs will be listed on thescreen.andP;  Clicking on the program's name tells Setup to add a Program Managericon.andP;  The second way is to drag the application's icon from a File Managerwindow into the Program Manager window for the desired group.andM;The third way, which is least friendly but gives the most control, is tocreate a new Program Item.andP;  This is much like creating a batch file, but withsubstantial help from Windows: The New menu offers to create a new programitem, the Program Item Properties dialogue box offers to browse the user'sdisks for the program to be run (creating a default command file), andmousesensitive buttons let the user run through a choice of standard icons tobe assigned.andP;  The user can edit the command line to include, for example,optional startup parameters.andP;  A conventional batch file can also be made intoa program item to handle even a complicated startup.andM;Most popular PC software, including Lotus 1-2-3, WordPerfect andAshton-Tate's dBASE, is not designed for Windows.andP;  Although Windoes is robustenough to run many such programs without fine-tuning, some behave poorlyunless Windows' parameters are adjusted.andP;  The Windows Setup utility willrecognize some of the more popular non-Windows programs, creating an icon forthe program in the Program Manager and creating a PIF (Program InformationFile).andP;  This contains vital settings such as screen modes, memory allocation,CPU priority and I/O port contention.andM;For other DOS programs, the progress is similar to Windows programs lackingfull-blown installation utilities.andP;  The user will have to deal with suchthings as setting up a Program Manager icon and may also need to create a PIFusing the Windows PIF Editor.andM;The PIF Editor is a well-designed graphic-interface tool, offeringcontext-sensitive help for its parameter fields and issuing warnings when theuser selects potentially danagerous settings such as &quot;Alows Close WhenActive,&quot; which lets the user end an application from its icon's menu evenwhen the application may still have work in progress.andM;PIF files or recommended settings are available for many DOS applications viabulletin boards, such as CompuServe, or from vendors' documentation ortechnical support.andM;Other programs that require extra attention are terminate-and-stay-resident(TSR) utilities and loadable device drivers.andP;  There is a trade-off betweenmaking the TSR or driver conveniently available to all applications byloading it before Windows, or maximizing application memory by loading suchthings only in the sessions where they are needed.andM;One Windows feature that isn't obvious is Windows' ability to launch theappropriate application when one of its document (data file) icons isdouble-clicked.andP;  For example, clicking on a file with a WRI extension willrun Windows Write and load the file.andM;This convenience is based on associations between one or more three-letterextensions and any given program.andP;  For example, a user might assign theextensions TXT, ASC, PRN and BAT to his or her preferred text editor; adouble-click on any such file in a File Manager window would open that editorin that file.andM;When a file's extension has no association, a double-click produces themessage &quot;no association exists for this data file.&quot;andP;  Instead, the applicationcan be run directly and instructed to load the file in the usual mannger; andalternative is to drag the data file's icon &quot;into&quot; the directory entry forthe desired application.andM;Windoes highlights applications for this purpose and asks the user to confirmthat the indicated programs should be started with that file.andP;  This techniqueworks only within the Fime Manager, however, and cannot be used with the moreconvenient icons of the Program Manager.andM;Some Windows programs, when installed, create associations automatically.andO;All of this seems mildly intimidating, perhaps, to the user accustomed to afamiliar set of non-Windows tools.andP;  When a user has been startingWordPerfect, for example, by simply typing &quot;WP&quot; every day for the last fiveyears, it's easty to forget that even ordinary DOs installations are notwithout their complications.andP;  Better visiblity and coordination of tools, andbetter use of system resrouces, are the payback for a little up-fron effort.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
