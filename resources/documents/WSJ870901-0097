Brazil stopped paying interest on an estimated $67 billion of foreign bank debt on Feb. 20, and with no serious talks with its bank creditors in prospect, regulators may have little choice but to tell banks to write down their loans by as much as 10%, these observers say.    Any requirement for banks to write down Brazilian loans would have important repercussions. It would make it much harder for banks to raise new money for Brazil and would create a need for further additions to banks' reserves by reducing their loan-loss provisions and casting further doubt on the entire developing-country debt situation. An increase in reserves would depress the banks' earnings, as it did in the second quarter.    A requirement to write down the loans would set the scene for a much more bitter confrontation between Brazil and its international bank creditors. That, in turn, might encourage other creditors to join Brazil in its unilateral refusal to service its foreign bank debt. It also would have a significant negative impact on relations between the U.S. and Brazil.    The Inter-Agency Country Exposure Review Committee, which will hold its third and last meeting of the year on Oct. 26, is made up of three officials from each of the main banking regulators -- the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Comptroller of the Currency's office. It sets standards for how banks should handle loans to countries that aren't servicing their debts.    &quot;Given the lack of movement in negotiations with the Brazilians, it may well be that ICERC will use its next meeting to tell the banks that the time has come&quot; for a write-down, said Riordan Roett, a professor at Johns Hopkins University who consults for money-center bankers.    Mr. Roett and others say the committee is likely to tell banks to classify their loans as value-impaired and require them to write them down by as much as 10%. &quot;I think they'll have to downgrade Brazil to value-impaired, everything is pointing in that direction,&quot; says a Wall Street economist who specializes in Latin America.    Spokesmen at the New York Fed and the Comptroller's office declined to comment on the forthcoming meeting, although a New York Fed spokesman confirmed the date of the meeting.    To be sure, bankers say there is still a chance that Brazil may make some token interest payment to bank creditors before the committee's meeting, or may start meaningful talks with its bankers in October. This would allow U.S. regulators to hold back from downgrading Brazil at least until the committee's next meeting after October, next spring.    Ever since U.S. banks began adding billions of dollars to their loan-loss reserves in May, regulators have been more aggressive about getting banks to write down shaky foreign credits, bankers say. &quot;First of all, they were telling us 5% to 10% for Peru, then they came back with 20% after the reserves,&quot; says a vice president at a New York money-center bank. Several banks already have written off their Peruvian loans completely.    The regulators' committee has three ways of classifying shaky foreign debtors: as substandard, as value-impaired or as a loss, a spokesman for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said. A value-impaired classification would require banks to start writing down their Brazilian loans by 10% for the first year, rising to 15% a year thereafter, the spokesman for the comptroller's office said. As many U.S. bankers note, Brazil already fulfills the committee's criteria for being value-impaired.    To be value-impaired, the spokesman for the comptroller's office says, a debtor must meet more than one of four conditions: that it hasn't paid interest for six months (Brazil passed that mark on Aug. 20); that it isn't complying with an economic program agreed upon with the International Monetary Fund, and that there is little prospect it will (Brazil so far has declined to agree to any such program); that it hasn't met its rescheduling terms for a year; and that it doesn't exhibit any definite prospects for an orderly restoration of debt service in the near future.    For the time being, Brazil shows little sign of any restoration of debt service. Its finance minister, Luiz Carlos Bresser Pereira, and chief debt negotiator, Fernao Bracher, aren't expected to meet with banks until late September at the earliest. William R. Rhodes, the senior Citicorp executive who chairs the bank committee that negotiates with Brazil, is on vacation until after Labor Day. Bankers say they don't expect any serious talks with Brazil at least until the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank at the end of September.    Meanwhile, most bankers are wary of being quoted about the forthcoming regulators' meeting. &quot;Everyone's sitting on the edge of their chairs on this one,&quot; says a banker who declines to be identified but who privately expects the committee to require banks to start writing down their Brazilian loans.    In a related development, Brazil has asked foreign banks to maintain short-term trade and interbank credits worth about $15 billion until year's end, pending &quot;negotiations on new accords for these credit lines.&quot;    The request appeared to reflect rising concern in Brazil that the credits could be vulnerable at a time when relations with foreign banks have grown increasingly tense. The credits have been informally renewed since March 31, when an agreement governing them expired. </TEXT></DOC>
