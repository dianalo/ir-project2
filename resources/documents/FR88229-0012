Background</ITAG>On January 12, 1988, the Department of Agriculture published a notice ofproposed rulemaking in the <T4>Federal Register </T4> (53 FR 749). The notice invited public commentsby February 11, 1988 on the proposed Agriculture Acquisition Circular No.2 which would amend the Agriculture Acquisition Regulation (AGAR). No publiccomments were received. Comments that were received from contracting activitieswithin the agency were editorial in nature. They were considered and adoptedto the extent that they would improve the clarity of this final rule.On February 8, 1988, Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 84-33 was publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 3688). The FAR amended the Federal AcquisitionRegulation (FAR), effective February 22, 1988, to provide single, uniformprocedures in the FAR for implementing OMB Circular A-125, Prompt Payment.Accordingly, although it was not included in the proposed rule, this finalrule removes the existing AGAR instructions concerning prompt payment,and does not adopt the proposed amendments thereto.This rulemaking amends the AGAR, as necessary, to incorporate labor standardsprovisions applicable to Departmental contracts for services. USDA hasbeen operating under instructions contained in the Federal AcquisitionCircular 84-1 to follow policy and procedures contained in Federal ProcurementRegulations (FPR), Temporary Regulation 76, for labor standards coverageapplicable to Federal service contracts. The FPR Temporary Regulation hasexpired.In addition this final rule revises the blanket authority delegated toheads of contracting activities to acquire ADP resources; adds policy andprocedures for conducting cost-plus-award-fee contracts; and adds uniformprovisions and clauses for solicitations and contracts issued and awardedby Departmental contracting offices.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Procedural Requirements</ITAG>A. Executive Order 12291The Executive order entitled ``Federal Regulations'' requires that certainregulations be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) priorto their promulgation. OMB Bulletin 85-7 exempts all but certain typesof procurement regulations from such review. This rule does not involveany of the topics requiring prior review under the bulletin and is accordinglyexempt from such review.B. Regulatory Flexibility ActThis rule was reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, Pub.L. 96-354, which requires preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysisfor any rule which is likely to have a significant economic impact on asubstantial number of small entities. This rule will have no impact oninterest rates, tax policies or liabilities, the costs of goods or services,or other direct economic factors. It will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities, and therefore, no regulatoryflexibility analysis has been prepared.C. Paperwork Reduction ActAll information collections contained in 48 CFR Subpart 422.70 are thedirect result of Department of Labor (DOL) rules as published in 29 CFRPart 4. The DOL rules have been cleared by the Office of Management andBudget (OMB) and assigned the OMB control numbers shown therein. All otherinformation collections contained in this AGAR amendment have been clearedby OMB in prior rulemaking or as declared by USDA in its information collectionrequests. For example, the information collections relative to the submissionof contract proposals in section 415.407 have been declared and clearedpreviously as contract specific collections. This rule merely consolidatesa range of information that contracting officer should, at their discretion,consider asking prospective contractors to furnish.D. National Environmental Policy ActUSDA has concluded that promulgation of this rule would not represent amajor Federal action having a significant impact on the human environmentunder the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 432,et seq., 1976), or the Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40CFR Part 1020), and therefore does not require an environmental impactstatement or an environmental assessment pursuant to NEPA.<ITAG tagnum="85">List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 404, 407, 409, 410, 412, 414, 415,416, 417, 419, 422, 424, 425, 428, 432, 436, 437, 439, 442, 445, 446, 447,and 452</ITAG>Government procurement.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, February 23, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6"> Frank Gearde, Jr., </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director, Office of Operations. </ITAG>For the reasons set out in this preamble, Chapter 4 of Title 48 of theCode of Federal Regulations is amended as set forth below. 1.

(a) <T3>Applicability. </T3>(1) Contracting officers should consider thosecontract actions which conform to the use criteria at FAR 16.404-2(b) andwhich have a potential value of $5,000,000 or more as candidates for awardas a CPAF contract. However, contracting officers may use CPAF contractsfor requirements whose estimated value is less than $5,000,000. (2) The formal procedures established in paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) ofthis section apply to contracts estimated to exceed $1,000,000. The simplifiedprocedures prescribed in paragraph (h) of this section are authorized forCPAF contracts with a potential value of $1,000,000 or less. (b) <T3>Objectives. </T3>The award fee contract, when properly applied, willsatisfy three critical contracting objectives: (1) It provides for the reimbursement of allowable, allocable, and reasonablecosts; (2) It fixes a dollar amount beyond the initial estimate of costs thatrepresents the compensation for risk (base fee); and (3) It motivates performance throughout the life of a contract where evaluatedsuccess can yield additional income (award fee). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The CPAF contract is used when the work to be performed is such thatspecific quantitative objective measurement is not feasible and the requiredperformance extends over a sufficient period of time for the award feefeatures to be used effectively. (c) <T3>Fee limitations. </T3>Normally, the base fee should be not more thanthree percent of the estimated cost of the contract. (See FAR 15.903(d)for maximum fee limitations.) At the time of award, the contracting officershall obligate the total amount of base and award fee. The contractingofficer shall award the total award fee earned for the period being evaluated.The contracting officer shall not carry forward into a subsequent evaluationperiod any award fee not awarded in a previous evaluation period. (d) <T3>Definitions and responsibilities. </T3>``Award fee plan'' means a plan,developed by the Performance Evaluation Board (PEB), which identifies variouscategories of performance and clearly describes the criteria used by thePEB to evaluate contractor performance.

The contractormay report performance events directly to the evaluation coordinator eitheras they occur or as a summary report for the evaluation period.``Performance monitors'' means those Government employees designated toobserve, assess, and report the performance of the contractor on a close,continuous day-to-day basis. Performance monitors are to two categories:technical and business. The technical performance monitors report on thecontractors performing the technical requirements of the contract. Thebusiness performance monitors report on the business aspects of the contractor'sperformance; these individuals will be the contracting officer and costanalyst most familiar with the specific contractual and financial aspectsof the contract.``Period of evaluation'' means a segment of the contract's period of performancespecified in the award fee plan which will be evaluated by the PEB forpurposes of establishing the award fee for that period.(e) <T3>Appointment of personnel.</T3> (1) The HCA will determine, in concertwith the responsible program office, the participants in the award feeprocess.

The summaries will incorporatethe reported PE's which the coordinator considers significant, whetherreported by the performance monitor or the contractor. The evaluation coordinatorshall be responsible for preparing and presenting all material the PEBrequires for its performance assessment. This material will serve as thePEB's agenda, and as the complete documentation package which will supportthe PEB's fee recommendation. It will be organized into separate sectionsfor each performance evaluation category. Each section will consist ofthe following material:(A) Summary of significant performance events, and (B) The individual PE reports.(3) <T3>Evaluation of performance.</T3> The PEB shall perform a review of theperformance events against each performance evaluation category to arriveat the recommended award fee for each category as well as the total awardfee for the period. The PEB must meet within 30 calendar days after theend of each evaluation period. At the initial PEB meeting the board membersshall determine what fee the contractor would normally receive if the workwas being undertaken on a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) basis. After determiningthis amount, the PEB shall determine what percentage of the available awardfee pool that, when added to the base fee, will equal the amount the contractorwould receive under a CPFF contract. This percentage of award fee willset the baseline for satisfactory performance.(4) <T3>The period of evaluation.</T3> The period of evaluation will be atleast every six months. The desired period of evaluation will be everyfour months.(5) <T3>Performance evaluation report.</T3> Following the PEB meeting at whichthe award fee recommendation is reached, the executive secretary will preparea performance evaluation report and forward this to the contracting officer.The contracting officer will prepare a letter for signature of the FDOinforming the contractor's general management of the amount of basis ofthe fee awarded. The contracting officer shall forward the performanceevaluation report and the fee determination letter (the performance evaluationreport shall be an attachment to the fee determination letter) to the FDOfor signature. The FDO will review the performance evaluation and fee recommendationand make a final determination of fee.(h) <T3>Simplified procedures.</T3> The following CPAF procedures are authorizedfor procurements of $1,000,000 or less.(1) No appointment of a formal PEB is necessary. A program office representativeand the contracting officer shall perform the duties and functions of thePEB members. In lieu of performance monitors reporting to an evaluationcoordinator, the program official will personally monitor and assess thetechnical performance of the contractor for each evaluation period. Thecontracting officer will monitor the business aspects of the contractor'sperformance.(2) The chief of the contracting office shall approve the award fee planin lieu of the HCA.(3) The project officer and the contracting officer shall report performanceevents in the format described in 416.404-277(a)(1).

The approach used may vary fromwage determination to wage determination depending on the circumstances.Standard wage and salary administration practices which rank various jobclassifications by pay grade pursuant to point schemes or other job factorsmay, for example, be relied upon. Guidance may also be obtained from theway different jobs are rated under Federal pay systems (Federal Wage BoardPay System and the General Schedule) or from other wage determinationsissued in the same locality. Basic to the establishment of any conformablewage rate(s) is the concept that a pay relationship should be maintainedbetween job classifications based on the skill required and the dutiesperformed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) In the case of a contract modification, an exercise of an option,or extension of an existing contract, or in any other case where a Contractorsucceeds a contract under which the classification in question was previouslyconformed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this clause, a new conformed wagerate and fringe benefits may be assigned to the conformed classificationby indexing (i.e., adjusting) the previous conformed rate and fringe benefitsby an amount equal to the average (mean) percentage increase (or decrease,where appropriate) between the wages and fringe benefits specified forall classifications to be used on the contract which are listed in thecurrent wage determination, and those specified for the corresponding classificationsin the previously applicable wage determination.
