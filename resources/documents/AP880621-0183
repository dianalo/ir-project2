Botswana accused South Africa of ``state terrorism'' and saidthe commandos were planning a raid on a target in Gaborone, thecapital.   South Africa's military headquarters confirmed an army patrolhad fired on Botswana policemen Monday night while on anintelligence mission across the border.   The Botswana statement said the shooting occurred when commandossurprised the police patrol along a railway line about four milessouth of Gaborone.   Botswana said the police patrol was unarmed. South Africa saidBotswana police fired first, but the soldiers returned the shotsand then returned to their base in South Africa.   The South African statement said the two whites arrested at theroadblock were not part of the unit involved in the shootout. Thearmy declined further comment about the arrested men ``unless theBotswana government provides more details.''   South African commandos have crossed the border of neighboringcountries numerous times to raid suspected hideouts and bases ofthe African National Congress. The ANC is the main guerrillamovement fighting South Africa's government.   ``This action was not aimed at the government or the people ofBotswana,'' the South African statement said. ``The accusation thatSouth Africa made itself guilty of state terrorism is preposterous,especially coming from a country which allows terrorists to operatefrom its territory against South Africa.''   The office of President Quett Masire said the commandos were``preparing to mount a raid in Gaborone.''   Five commandos escaped, but police said two South Africancommandos were arrested at an army roadblock and were beingquestioned. Police identified hem as Corp. Johannes Basson, 25, andTheodore Hermanhen, a police or army reservist, both ofJohannesburg. No age was given for Hermanhen.   Earlier in June, after a series of bombings in Johannesburg andPretoria, South African Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok warnedthe ANC of retaliation.   The announcement of the arrests came hours after Gaborone policereported a carbomb had exploded at dawn Tuesday near the home of abuilding contractor in the capital.   The presidential statement said the bombing was ``yet anotherSouth African attempt on the lives of innocent Batswana.'' No onewas injured in the bombing.   Botswana officials say they do not condone the presence of ANCguerrillas, although the government is sympathetic to the ANC'saims. The ANC seeks to end the apartheid system of racialseparation, to install a one-man, one-vote political system and toestablish government controls over major economic sectors.   South African commandos have conducted several raids in Gaboroneagainst suspected ANC guerrillas allegedly using the city as astaging post for sabotage attacks in South Africa.   South African soldiers killed a man and three women in Marchwhen they raided a house on Gaborone's outskirts. One person waskilled in a similar attack in May 1986, and 15 were killed in aJune 1985 raid.</TEXT></DOC>
