Rememberthose 1960 forecasts of the checkless society? The cashless society?   Everyone can cite special examples.   Did anyone in 1970 foresee the incredible double-digit inflationand 20 percent interest rates? Of course not. And if seers in theearly 1980s foresaw seven straight years of economic expansionnobody heard them shouting.   And the 1990s? Will there be a ``Marshall Plan'' for Easternbloc nations whose economies have been stymied by central planning?Will European economic integration succeed? Your guess is as goodas the CIA's.   Much of what can indeed be forecast is demographically based.You can, for example, expect the number of Americans over age 65 togrow rapidly and baby boomers to become middle-aged. That much isin the numbers.   It is clear also that recent immigrants will play an increasingrole in business, a reality borne out by statistics. By the year2015, for example, Hispanics will comprise the largest minoritysegment of the population.   It is likely also that older people will continue to work, iftheir companies let them, because of health improvements andgrowing life spans. And that many of them, and younger workers too,will work from home.   The latter is based on a continuation of existing trends, whichshow both business and individuals utilizing technology _computers, copiers, facsimiles, telephone lines, answering machines_ to transport data rather than people.   In 1988, according to Link Resources Inc., a market researchfirm, 4.2 million Americans began working at home for the firsttime, up from 2.4 million in 1987. Link foresees more than 30million in the 1990s.   Arnold Sanow, a small-business consultant, believes many workerswill have their own businesses. He sees them providing work moreefficiently for larger companies, and even becoming capable ofcompeting with them.   ``It's not just young entrepreneurs working from home anymore,''says Sanow, president of Business Source, based in the Washington,D.C., area. ``Even large corporations have innovative home workprograms to fit employee needs.''   Believing the trend will continue, American Telephone andamp;Telegraph Co. employs Sanow as a spokesman for its Toll-Free 800Business Directory, which has grown from 20,000 listings in 1984 tomore than 120,000 in the latest edition.   As ATandamp;T sees it, the growth of toll-free numbers also permitssmall businesses to operate nationally.   As callers, it makes it easy for them to acquire information,goods and services inexpensively from anywhere. As owners of an 800listing, it permits them to advertise widely and accept sales fromany part of the country.   In spite of such forecasts, and in fact the likelihood that theywill be correct, nobody can say for certain that working at homewill continue to grow as anticipated. Some other development,inconceivable now, could thwart it.   But it is such demographically and actuarily based forecaststhat seem most likely to come true. If in 1989 there are a certainnumber of people aged 60, it can be fairly well predicted how manywill be 70 in 1999.   Combined with current trends, such as the work-at-home movementand the development of technology that makes it more efficient totransport information than people, such forecasts have at least afair chance.   A better chance, certainly, than those economic forecasts aboutinflation and recession which carry guarantees that, at best, aregood for a few months.</TEXT><NOTE>End advance PMs Monday, Dec. 18</NOTE></DOC>
