After initial laboratoryscale feasibility experiments the process was scaled up successfully,using a variety of different ultrafiltration modules. The informationaccumulated on membrane performance, membrane fouling and flux restorationtechniques, and ancillary equipment performance was used to design amuch larger demonstration pilot plant. This plant has been constructedand is now processing continuously each day over 1m{sup 3} of a realradioactive effluent.</TEXT></DOC>
