Sigoloff, for $12 a share, or $478.2 million.    The surprise offer for the manufacturing and retailing concern by a unit of WII Holdings Corp., a corporation formed by Mr. Sigoloff that includes other Wickes managers and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., was announced late yesterday. Drexel Burnham advised WII Holdings that it is &quot;highly confident&quot; of its ability to finance the leveraged buy-out.    Under a definitive merger agreement, WII Holdings will begin a tender offer no later than Friday for as many as 39.9 million, or about 83%, of Wickes's common shares outstanding. The offer will remain open until at least Oct. 20.    Under the agreement, each remaining share of common stock not bought in the tender offer will be converted into cumulative redeemable exchangeable sinking fund preferred stock of the surviving corporation with a liquidation preference and value of $12. Neither the company's Series A preferred stock nor usable warrants will be purchased under the merger agreement or offer.    Including the shares to be converted to preferred with a value of $12 each, the total indicated value of Wickes's approximately 48 million common shares outstanding is $576 million.    Wickes shares closed Friday at $9.375, up 62.5 cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.    In an interview earlier this year, Mr. Sigoloff confirmed Wall Street rumors that the managers had considered a leveraged buy-out in 1987 but dismissed it as impractical. In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors buys a company, largely with debt financing. The investors' debt is repaid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets.    Wickes, a retailer and maker of automotive products, wall coverings and fabrics, reported total debt of about $2 billion at April 30. With the additional costs from the buy-out, the investment group probably would be pressured to sell off some assets, but it's unclear whether the group has planned for any asset sales.    The offer is subject to several conditions, among them the tender of at least 50% of Wickes's shares outstanding. The company's board said it had appointed an independent committee of outside directors to consider the buy-out proposal, and Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. Inc. advised the committee.    Mr. Sigoloff couldn't be reached for comment, and the company declined to comment on the transaction beyond a prepared statement. In the release, the company said the directors, with two interested members abstaining, had determined that the tender offer and merger proposal are fair to shareholders.    Wickes also announced a loss of $12.4 million for the second quarter ended July 30, compared with net income of $18.9 million, or 37 cents a share, a year ago. Sales were $937.9 million, compared with $865 million a year earlier.    The quarterly results include earnings from continuing operations of $10.4 million, and losses from discontinued operations of $22.8 million. A year earlier, Wickes reported earnings from continuing operations of $9.9 million, earnings from discontinued operations of $30.4 million and extraordinary losses of $21.5 million stemming mostly from a charge to cover costs and liabilities relating to certain PVC-backed carpeting.    For the six months, Wickes reported a loss of $15 million, against net income of $138.9 million a year ago. Sales were $1.9 billion, compared with $1.7 billion a year earlier.    &quot;The impact of Wickes's disappointing second-quarter results, caused by poor performance of our discontinued operations, higher-than-anticipated interest costs resulting from the delay of the company's divestiture activity, and lower-than-expected financial performance of the (Collins andamp; Aikman) companies, make it unlikely in our judgment that our stockholders would see short- or intermediate-term appreciation in their share price,&quot; Mr. Sigoloff said in the statement.    Mr. Sigoloff further said the buy-out agreement doesn't inhibit Wickes from seeking a higher offer, and said his group has agreed not to buy shares in the tender offer for 60 days from the date of the announcement.    Despite an ambitious acquisition program since emerging from bankruptcy court proceedings in 1985, Wickes has been consistently dogged by lackluster stock performance. The October market crash compounded the problem, with Wickes's stock closing at $12.50, off $1.725, on Oct. 19.    Wickes filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code on April 24, 1982. With $4 billion in annual sales, the retailing concern was then the second-largest Chapter 11 case in U.S. business history in terms of total assets.    Previously, as president and chief executive of Daylin Inc., Mr. Sigoloff had built an experienced team of managers as he guided that troubled retailer through bankruptcy court proceedings.    At Wickes, working with many of the same managers, Mr. Sigoloff pushed the bloated company through a tough restructuring in 33 months.    In June 1985, only five months after emerging from Chapter 11, the newly streamlined Wickes began an aggressive acquisition campaign by agreeing to pay $1 billion for Gulf andamp; Western Inc.'s consumer and industrial products group.    Following that deal, Wickes launched three multibillion-dollar tender offers -- for National Gypsum Co., Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. and Lear Siegler Inc. -- that fizzled. It also bought Collins andamp; Aikman, the textiles concern, for $1.16 billion.    More recently, Wickes has been trying to sell off its apparel and hosiery divisions, but has been slowed by market uncertainties following the crash. It sold its lumber unit for about $307 million last May. </TEXT></DOC>
