She said soldiers used anunidentified chemical in the bloody clash.   A group of intellectuals who heard the writer's account of theApril 9 clash immediately called for the firing of senior policeand KGB officials.   The writer, Galina P. Kornilova of Moscow, said she was in theGeorgian capital of Tbilisi for the week of protests and gatheredinformation from witnesses.   She said hospitals were told to prepare for casualties two hoursbefore the soldiers began to forcibly clear out demonstrators.   Georgian officials have said they did not expect fatalities whenthey ordered an end to the rallies in downtown Tbilisi.   Officials said 19 people died in the April 9 clash, but Georgiannationalists have put the death toll at up to 50.   Ms. Kornilova also said three people died from the spraying orinjection of a chemical. Dr. Mirab Urushadze at the CentralRepublican Hospital in Tbilisi confirmed in a telephone interviewthat a number of people had been hospitalized from the effects ofthe unknown gas but said he knew of no deaths.   Western reporters have been barred from Georgia since thetroubles began, and it was not immediately possible to verifyindependently the charges made at Saturday's meeting of theMoskovskaya Tribuna, a group of reformist intellectuals.   In Italy, a front-page editorial in the Vatican newspaperL'Osservatore Romano said the Soviet response to the demonstrationswas tragic and that no government had the right to oppressminorities.   Historian Leonid M. Batkin, who led the Tribuna meeting,responded to Ms. Kornilova's allegations by demanding aninvestigation.   He also called for the dismissal of Politburo member Viktor M.Chebrikov, who directs the legal system; the defense and interiorministers and the head of the KGB.   Georgia's Communist Party and government leaders tookresponsibility for the violence and were replaced Friday.   The Tribuna planned a demonstration in Moscow Sunday to demandthe investigation and dismissals.   The group was visibly shaken by Ms. Kornilova's report thatsoldiers allegedly chased down fleeing protesters to attack themwith sharpened shovels, clubs and chemicals.   ``A woman doctor who rushed to rescue the children was killed,''Ms. Kornilova said. ``Then they broke into the ambulance and pulledout a wounded person and beat him to death. They ran after thosewho fled.''   Soviet media have provided few details of the clash other thanthe official death toll.   Ms. Kornilova said more than 100 parents have complained topolice that their children disappeared after the confrontation.   She said she heard the Georgian health minister say three peopledied from the poison and that others were dying.   A worker at the Georgian Ministry of Health contacted by phonesaid she was not competent to say whether demonstrators had diedfrom exposure to gas.   Dr. Urushadze said ``there are people who are ill, physicallysick, from gas. We don't know how many there are, as some registerand others don't.'' He said the soldiers used spray cans orcapsules.   Within hours of the clash, Tbilisi residents contacted bytelephone said the troops had used tear gas on the protesters.   Once the soldiers attacked, youths formed a front line of thosewho knew karate and veterans of the war in Afghanistan.   The streets of the Georgian capital were reported quietSaturday, but the military newspaper Red Star said police vehicleshad been pelted with rocks and bottles. The evening news showed amass of flowers spread on the site of the confrontation.   Tengiz Grigorashvili, a journalist for the official Gruzinformnews agency, said by telephone that separate funerals were beingheld for some victims.   Demonstrations in Georgia first began April 4 when protesterscriticized calls from members of the republic's ethnic Abkhazianminority to break away because of alleged discrimination byGeorgians.   Other protesters have demanded Georgia secede from the SovietUnion because of alleged interference from the central government.</TEXT></DOC>
