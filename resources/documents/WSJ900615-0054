The $9 million guaranteed to Gerald Greenwald, who leftChrysler Corp. as vice chairman last month to head a proposedemployee buy-out of UAL Corp., is the latest in lucrativefront-end pledges made to corporate heavy hitters who switchteams.</LP><TEXT>   To win senior executives tied to their employers throughbigger stock-option and other long-term golden handcuffs,suitors are finding it takes quite a golden key. &quot;Most peopleat the senior management level . . . are expecting to bebought out,&quot; says Michael Halloran, head of the executivecompensation practice at consultants Towers Perrin, who callssuch bonuses &quot;the golden hello.&quot;   Moreover, initial bonuses are no longer just for those atthe very top. As long-term compensation plans edge fartherdown the corporate ladder, so also do recruitment bonuses.&quot;Sign-on bonuses are the counterattack to long-termcompensation plans,&quot; says Barbara Provus, a principal withSweeney Shepherd, recruiters in Chicago.   Signing bonuses aren't exactly new. Chrysler wooed and wonLee Iacocca more than a decade ago with a deal that includeda $1.5 million front-end payment. But bonuses clearly arebecoming more prevalent. Gerard Roche, chairman of Heidrick andamp;Struggles recruiters in Chicago, says 60% of his top-levelsearches involve a signing bonus these days. A search he justcompleted included a $1.5 million bonus to the candidate.   Companies that offer signing bonuses run the risk ofcreating dissension among managers who don't receive suchenticements. Even so, more companies believe such paymentsare necessary at least partly to insulate executives fromrisk. Mr. Greenwald is joining an employee buy-out thathasn't happened yet -- and maybe never will. When RichardMiller joined troubled Wang Laboratories Inc. as presidentand chief executive officer last year, the company guaranteedthree years' salary and bonus totaling $1 million a year --more than double that of his predecessor. He also receivedstock options for two million Wang shares, a companyspokeswoman says.   But specialists say bonuses are structured mainly tocompensate executives for what they leave behind. Mr.Miller's guarantee at Wang was relatively modest comparedwith that of other executives coming into such circumstances,one compensation consultant says. But Mr. Miller had leftGeneral Electric Co. earlier when the unit he headed wastraded away, and thus had no big-company benefits asbargaining leverage. Mr. Miller couldn't be reached forcomment.   More often, a company pays heavily to get a seniorexecutive. When RJR Nabisco Inc. hired Louis V. Gerstner aschief executive last year, it gave him $14.6 million up frontto compensate for &quot;accrued and expected&quot; benefits he lost byleaving the presidency of American Express Co., according toRJR proxy statements. RJR also agreed to pay Mr. Gerstner$446,374 a year in retirement benefits.   &quot;There are so many things to buy out these days,&quot; saysAlan Johnson, managing director, compensation, for recruitersHandy Associates in New York. In 1985, salary made up 45% ofa chief executive's compensation; last year, it was 39% anddropping. The remainder comes from bonuses, stock benefitsand performance plans. There are also supplemental executiveretirement programs, health plans, cars and country clubmemberships to consider.   Mr. Greenwald, who at Chrysler was in line to succeed LeeIacocca as chief executive, says at United he wanted &quot;acompensation package that would not cause me to look back. Itis a best effort at creating a compensation package thatwould represent my expectations over the next five years atChrysler.&quot;   Mr. Greenwald had made a great deal of money at Chryslerin the past -- including $11.6 million from exercising stockoptions in 1985, 1986 and 1987 -- but there was no guaranteehe would do so again. According to Chrysler proxies, all thestock options issued to him since 1986 were valueless when heleft Chrysler because of the company's falling stock price.   However, Mr. Greenwald says it isn't valid to calculatethe options in relation to current stock values because mostof them run for 10 years and no one can say what the stockwill be worth in the future.   Mr. Greenwald's package at United includes a $5 millionbonus for signing on with the buy-out group, according topeople familiar with his compensation. He will receive anadditional $4 million fee if the buy-out isn't completed; ifit is completed, his salary and other compensation will totalover $12 million in five years.   Increasingly, recruiters find that stars even further downin a company are demanding to be bought out. &quot;You can'trecruit people at any level of the organization if you can'tkeep them whole,&quot; says Robert Salwen, a principal withWilliam M. Mercer Inc., consultants in New York.   Mr. Greenwald himself says he had to pay bonuses torecruit subordinates at Chrysler. &quot;You can't attractoutsiders and say, `By the way, we expect you to take a cutfrom whatever you were paid,'&quot; he says. &quot;That just doesn'tmake common sense.&quot;   Ms. Provus from Sweeney Shepherd recently found someone tofill a $200,000-a-year general counsel position. &quot;Theindividual was walking away from several long-term incentiveplans, involving stock and cash. The only way we could gethim {was} to figure out the value, and put that on thetable.&quot;   The same applies even to much lower-paid positions, shesays. At a company such as Digital Equipment Corp., she says,which has a generous stock program &quot;even if the person isonly at $70,000 or $80,000 {in salary}, he or she might havea couple hundred thousand dollars worth of stock they ownthat's not vested. That's a summer home or a collegeeducation. That's expensive for middle management to walkaway from.&quot; A Digital spokesman says such valuable stockholdings for middle managers were more likely several yearsback when the company's stock was trading at more than doubletoday's level.   Even at entry levels, more companies are mimicking lawfirms and consulting firms, which long have offered signingbonuses to attract new candidates. In a recent William M.Mercer survey, 60% of hospitals said they either used bonusesor planned to begin doing so. Mark Edwards, a principal atconsultants Sibson andamp; Co., Princeton, N.J., says typicalsign-on bonuses for electrical engineers or programmers whoare in high demand might range from $2,000 to $15,000.   One motivation for using a bonus, rather than highersalaries, is to avoid disrupting the rest of theorganization. &quot;Sometimes you have someone who doesn't fitinto a salary level,&quot; says Jose Berrios, personnel directorat the media company Gannett Co. &quot;If you go out and bring ina person at a higher level . . . that really sets up anequity problem,&quot; he says, noting that the company uses suchbonuses on &quot;a case-by-case basis.&quot;   Recruiter Paul R. Ray Jr., president of Paul R. Ray Inc.,Fort Worth, Texas, cites a candidate courted by a clientcompany. Because the manager was already making as much asthe highest-paid person at his level in the new company, itoffered an upfront payment of 25% of his first-yearcompensation and promised gradual salary increases for thefuture.   But sometimes, signing bonuses can create dissension.Union officials at United try to play down Mr. Greenwald'sbonus, contending that talk of it may jeopardize the buy-out.(United workers are being asked to take pay cuts as part ofthe buyout.) At Apple Computer Inc., a $1.5 million signingbonus for a new chief financial officer helped to fuelemployee discontent earlier this year.   One compensation consulting company that pays signingbonuses to attract actuaries, who are in short supply,declines to discuss the practice because of the risk ofalienating people who weren't offered bonuses. In the end,however, such big bonuses are governed by the same thing thatgoverned big salary offers in the past: &quot;Everything has to dowith how much they want the guy,&quot; says Mr. Johnson at HandyAssociates. &quot;No one has a manual that says they have to doit.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
