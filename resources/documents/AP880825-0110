DICKERSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A judge today spared Maria DeSillers a jailsentence for contempt of court, ruling she could not be ordered tosurrender records and items bought with donations for her late sonRonnie's liver transplant.   Dade Circuit Judge Francis Christie said surrendering the items``would tend to incriminate her'' in parallel criminalinvestigations.   Ms. DeSillers only smiled slightly as the judge made theannoncement.   ``I'm very happy. People have forgotten what Ronnie wentthrough,'' she said outside the courtroom.   Ronnie, 7, died in April 1987 while awaiting a fourth transplantat Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.   ``I'm just gratified,'' said her attorney Roy Black, who hadrepeatedly raised the issue of self-incrimination during thetwo-day contempt hearing.   Michael Dribin, the attorney for the court-appointed curator,refused to comment on the ruling.   The hearing was to determine if Ms. DeSillers should be jailedfor her failure to turn over financial records and surrenderjewelry, clothes, furniture and other items she bought with some ofthe $690,000 donated for her son's unsuccessful operations.   As the hearing ended, however, it was Ms. DeSillers' boyfriendJose Castillo who was taken into custody by Metro-Dade police.Castillo had been sitting supportively behnd Ms. DeSillers duringthe proceedings.   Police spokesman Victor Fernandez said Castillo had pawned astolen computer at the same shop he also pawned items allegedlybought by Ms. DeSillers with donations.   Earlier during the hearing, Diana Munez told the court she gaveMaria DeSillers $900 in cash for her personal use.   ``I imagined she would have some need. I put it in purse,'' saidMunez, one of six witnesses who said their contributions were forboth Ronnie and his mother.   Another witness, Maria Garcia, said she gave $50 for Ronnie andgave other cash to his mother ``for whatever she needed.''   In closing arguments Black said his client, who is also undercriminal investigation, has a right against self-incrimination.   ``The court, I know, has the power to put her in jail, and a lotof people would applaud,'' Black said. ``I just ask the court toexercise its discretion and common sense.''   But Dribin said the matter was clear.   ``What's at issue is the integrity of the legal system,'' Dribinsaid. ``Ms. DeSillers was the custodian of those funds. She has aresonsibility to account for them.''   Lawyers handling the estate of the boy ``are trying to showshe's a greedy, uncaring person and that's not so,'' Black said.   Christie had ruled that the thousands of donations for Ronniebelong in a trust to pay the boy's outstanding medical bills or tohelp sick, needy children.   The judge had repeatedly ordered Ms. DeSillers to give tocourt-appointed estate curator Karen Gievers the financial recordsand items allegedly bought with about $200,000 in donations.   Ms. DeSillers this month surrendered her BMW car but nothingelse, and Ms. Gievers has asked the judge to hold her in contempt.   Ronnie's plight was widely publicized after more than $4,000gathered for him by schoolmates was stolen from a classroom closet,and donations began pouring in from around the world.   Among donations received were $1,000 from President Reagan and$200,000 from Miami Beach industrialist Victor Posner.   Ms. DeSillers gave Children's Hospital a deposit but has refusedto pay the remaining $262,000 medical bill, claiming that her sonreceived improper care.</TEXT></DOC>
