The TCAwould consist of airspace from the surface or higher within a 25-mile radiusof Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport to and including 10,000 feetabove mean sea level (MSL). Establishment of this TCA would impose certainoperating rules and pilot/equipment requirements, including requirementsfor an operable two-way radio, a 4096 transponder with automatic altitude-reportingequipment, and an operable very high frequency omni-directional radio range(VOR) or tactical air navigational aid (TACAN) receiver; and restrictionson student pilot operations. This action is intended to increase the capabilityof the air traffic control (ATC) system to separate all aircraft in theterminal airspace around the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.It is based on data indicating that a high percentage of near midair collisionsreported to the FAA in terminal areas involves visual flight rules (VFR)aircraft that are not required to be under the control of ATC. The objectiveof this proposal is to substantially increase safety while accommodatingthe legitimate concerns of airspace users.

On October 14, 1988, the FAA publisheda final rule which revised the classification and pilot/equipment requirementsfor conducting operations in a TCA (53 FR 40318). Specifically, the rule:(a) Establishes a single-class TCA; (b) requires the pilot-in-command ofa civil aircraft operating within a TCA to hold at least a private pilotcertificate, except for a student pilot who has received certain documentedtraining; and (c) eliminates the helicopter exception from the minimumnavigational equipment requirement.The FAA published a final rule on June 21, 1988 which requires Mode C equipmentwhen operating within 30 miles of any designated TCA primary airport fromthe surface to 10,000 feet MSL, except for operations by certain aircrafttypes specifically excluded (53 FR 23356).On February 3, 1987, the FAA published a final rule which established requirementspertaining to the use, installation, inspection, and testing of Air TrafficControl Radar Beacon System (ATCRBS) and Mode S transponders in U.S.-registeredcivil aircraft (53 FR 3380). The rule adopted continues to require a transponderfor operation in each TCA.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The TCA program was developed to reduce the midair collision potentialin the congested airspace surrounding an airport with high density airtraffic by providing an area in which all aircraft will be subject to certainoperation rules and equipment requirements.The density of traffic and the type of operation being conducted in theairspace surrounding major terminals increases the probability of midaircollisions. An extensive study in 1970 found that the majority of midaircollisions occurred between a general aviation (GA) aircraft and eitheran air carrier, military or another GA aircraft. The basic causal factorcommon to these conflicts was the mix of uncontrolled aircraft operatingunder VFR and controlled aircraft operating under instrument flight rules(IFR). TCA's provide a method to accommodate the increasing number of IFRand VFR operations. The regulatory requirements of TCA airspace affordthe greatest protection for the greatest number of people by providingATC with an increased capability to provide aircraft separation service,thereby minimizing the mix of controlled and uncontrolled aircraft.On August 22, 1987, the Secretary of Transportation announced nine locationsfor which the FAA would issue notices of proposed rulemaking (NPRM's) proposingestablishment of TCA's. The nine candidates cited qualify for TCA statusby meeting the criteria published in FAA Handbook 7400.2, ``Proceduresfor Handling Airspace Matters.'' The criteria for establishing a TCA arebased on factors which include the number of aircraft and people usingthat airspace, the traffic density, and the type or nature of operationsbeing conducted. Accordingly, guidelines have been established to identifyTCA locations based on two basic elements_the number of enplaned passengersand the number of aircraft operations.To date, the FAA has established a total of 23 TCA's. The FAA is proposingto take action to modify or implement the application of these proven controltechniques to more airports to provide greater protection of air trafficin the airspace regions most commonly used by passenger-carrying aircraft.<ITAG tagnum="84">PRE-NPRM Public Input</ITAG>Airspace MeetingsTwo Pre-NPRM airspace meetings were held (June 30 and July 28, 1988) toallow local aviation interests and airspace users an opportunity to presentinput on the design of the proposed Phoenix TCA. During the course of thesemeetings, there were presentations from the Air Line Pilots Association(ALPA), two local user groups (Arizona Airspace Utilization Committee (AAUC)and Arizona Pilots Association (APA)), private pilots, and concerned citizens.ALPA supported a ``generic'' FAA design for the Phoenix TCA, stating thatthe lateral limits should extend to 30 miles and vertical limits shouldbe at least 10,000 feet MSL. ALPA's concerns centered on ensuring turbojetcontainment within the TCA, taking into consideration aircraft performanceduring hot weather. ALPA stated that the Sky Harbor Airport (PHX) musthave a very high frequency omni-directional radio range and distance measuringequipment (VOR/DME) or VORTAC on the field. Further, the Association endorsedthe establishment of a north-south VFR transition route.The AAUC presented its design of the proposed Phoenix TCA in the two publicmeetings and in a subsequent meeting between an AAUC subcommittee and FAArepresentatives on February 22, 1989. The boundaries of this proposal werebased almost exclusively on visual landmarks (roads, rivers and mountains).This design was based upon the fact that the largest sector of users inthe state operate under VFR. The lateral limits of the AAUC proposal extendedto 20 miles, with vertical limits of 10,000 feet MSL. The AAUC recommendedthat the FAA make a commitment to install a VOR/DME or VORTAC on the airport.This group initially supported a north-south VFR corridor.The APA, a member of the AAUC, made a separate proposal. The APA's proposalis based upon the ``core'' of AAUC's design. This group felt that the 20-milearcs to the north and south (as per AAUC's design) were not necessary forthis TCA. APA stated that the size of a TCA is determined by IFR and aircarrier operations, but boundaries must be established along identifiablevisual landmarks readily seen by VFR pilots wishing to avoid the TCA. TheAPA supported a design with vertical limits at 8,000 feet MSL on conditionthat provisions can be made for sailplanes and nonelectrical aircraft tooperate without Mode C equipment up to 10,000 feet MSL, outside the TCAand within 30 miles of Sky Harbor Airport. If these operations cannot beaccommodated by the FAA, the top of the TCA should be set at 10,000 feetMSL with provisions for a north-south VFR corridor. The APA also recommendedthat a VOR/DME be installed on the airport before TCA implementation.The majority of the private pilots' comments supported the concepts ofthe AAUC or APA proposals.A resident from the area (nonpilot) supported a ``generic'' FAA TCA design.Written Comments The FAA accepted written comments of this Pre-NPRM proposal until August15, 1988. A total of 22 comments were received during this period. Theseletters included: 15 supporting AAUC's proposal, 5 endorsing APA's design,and 2 other proposals submitted by private pilots.The comments received are summarized as follows:1. A VOR/DME or VORTAC should be installed on the airport prior to TCAimplementation.2. Provisions should be made for non-Mode C-equipped helicopters to operateat specified altitudes.3. The implementation of the TCA should be delayed until July 1, 1989,to coincide with Final Rule 88-2 regarding Mode C.4. Measures should be taken to ensure that the Phoenix TRACON is adequatelystaffed and has sufficient equipment.5. An exemption should be granted to student pilots using the Sky HarborAirport after TCA implementation, given proper Certified Flight Instructoror Certified Flight Instructor Instrument endorsements.6. Design of the TCA should be based on use of visual landmarks.The FAA evaluated all the comments and designs received on this proposal.A common recommendation in the comments was the use of visual landmarksto distinguish TCA boundaries. Since the weather in Phoenix is predominantlyVFR, the proposed design utilizes as many visual landmarks as practicalto define the various segments of the TCA.Another issue mentioned frequently was the installation of a VOR/DME orVORTAC on the airport. The FAA is in the process of identifying a suitablesite on or near the Sky Harbor Airport for this equipment. The proposedinstallation is scheduled for a mid-1990 completion date. Even though aTCA can be established with the VORTAC in the present location with noderogation of safety, the FAA is considering relocating the VORTAC on airportproperty. Until then, pilots will be able to use existing electronic navigationalfacilities as well as prominent visual landmarks. This system is currentlyin effect at other TCA's.An uncontrolled VFR corridor was requested by several user groups. Thisrequest was considered in developing the proposed design. Due to trafficflows and airspace sectorization, an uncontrolled corridor was not feasible.Establishment of this type of airspace would result in air traffic transitingportions of the TCA utilized by turbojet arrivals without being identifiedand without being required to contact Phoenix approach control or Phoenixtower. As an alternative to the VFR corridor, the FAA has developed a transitionroute that it believes will be safer than the corridor and will meet theneeds of the users for a convenient north/south route.The VFR transition route, which does not require rulemaking, would be establishedthrough the proposed Phoenix TCA for VFR aircraft. Pilots requesting adesignated VFR transition route would comply with all TCA requirementsincluding an ATC authorization. The VFR transition route would be publishedon the Phoenix Terminal Area Chart.The proposed VFR transition route, Biltmore, extends from the southeastalong Interstate 10, then north over the Phoenix Sky Harbor InternationalAirport. The altitudes available on the Biltmore transition route wouldbe 3,500 feet MSL to 5,500 feet MSL as assigned by ATC.The AAUC recommended that the TCA extend to 10,000 feet. This suggestionis encompassed in the proposed design. The proposed design extends to 25miles from the primary airport which differs from AAUC's recommendationof a 20-mile extension. The added distance was necessary to ensure turbojetdeparture containment during hot or inclement weather.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposal</ITAG>The FAA is considering an amendment to Part 71 of the Federal AviationRegulations (14 CFR Part 71) to establish a TCA at Phoenix Sky Harbor InternationalAirport, AZ. The 1987 passenger enplanements for the Phoenix Sky HarborInternational Airport were 8,911,660 which is more than double the establishedcriteria of 3.5 million. Additionally, within the proposed boundaries,435,836 flight operations were conducted of which 244,309 were air carrier.Consequently, the FAA has determined that establishment of a TCA at PhoenixSky Harbor International Airport is in the interest of flight safety andwill result in a greater degree of protection for the greatest number ofpeople during flight in that terminal area. Phoenix Sky Harbor InternationalAirport is currently served by an ARSA, which would be rescinded concurrentwith the establishment of this TCA. Additionally, within the lateral boundariesof the TCA proposed herein, there are two nonregulatory airspace areas,Alert Area A-231 and the Williams 1 Military Operations Area (MOA), AZ.Adoption of the proposed TCA would result in adjustments to the airspaceand operations conducted within both of these areas.Section 91.90 of Part 91 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR Part91) defines TCA's and prescribes operating rules for aircraft in airspacedesignated as a TCA. The TCA rule provides, in part, that prior to enteringthe TCA, any aircraft arriving at any airport within the TCA or flyingthrough a TCA must: (1) Obtain appropriate authorization from ATC; (2)unless otherwise authorized by ATC, all large turbine engine-powered aircraftoperating to or from a primary airport shall operate above the designatedfloors of the TCA; (3) comply with any procedures established by ATC forsuch operations as pilot training at an airport within a TCA; (4) holdat least a private pilot certificate; (5) meet the requirements of andSection;61.95 if the aircraft is operated by a student pilot; (6) have an operableVOR or TACAN receiver; (7) have an operable two-way radio capable of communicationswith ATC on appropriate frequencies for that TCA; and (8) be equipped withthe applicable operating transponder and automatic altitude reporting equipmentspecified in paragraph (a) of andSection; 91.24, except as provided in paragraph(d) of that section. Any aircraft departing from an airport located insidethe TCA is required to receive a clearance from ATC prior to takeoff.All aircraft operating within a TCA are required to comply with all ATCclearances and instructions and any FAA arrival or departure traffic patternfor the airport of intended operation. However, the rule permits ATC toauthorize deviations from any of the operating requirements of the rulewhen safety considerations justify the deviation or more efficient utilizationof the airspace can be attained. Ultralight vehicle operations and parachutejumps in a TCA may only be conducted under the terms of an ATC authorization.Definitions, operating requirements, and specific airspace designationsapplicable to TCA's may be found in andSection;andSection; 71.12, 71.401, and71.403 of Part 71 (14 CFR Part 71) and andSection;andSection; 91.1 and 91.90of Part 91 (14 CFR Part 91).The standard configuration of a TCA consists of 3 concentric circles centeredon the primary airport extending to 10, 20, and 30 miles respectively.The vertical limits of the TCA are 12,500 feet above MSL, with the floorestablished at the surface in the inner area and at levels appropriateto containment of operations in the outer areas. Variations of these criteriamay be authorized contingent upon terrain, adjacent regulatory airspace,and factors unique to the terminal area. The airspace configuration containedherein is the result of an extensive staff study conducted by the localFAA authority after obtaining public input from informal airspace meetingsand coordinating with the FAA regional office. The FAA has determined thefollowing proposed TCA airspace configuration is consistent with TCA objectivesand allows consideration of terminal area flight operations and terrainas follows:1. That airspace extending upward from the surface to and including 10,000feet MSL bounded on the north by Camelback Road on the east by Pima/PriceRoad, on the south by Guadalupe Road and Interstate 10, and on the westby 51st Avenue. This airspace is necessary to contain large turbine-poweredaircraft within the confines of the TCA while operating to and from theprimary airport.2. That airspace on the east and west of the Phoenix Sky Harbor InternationalAirport, excluding that airspace in paragraph 1, extending from 3,000 feetMSL to and including 10,000 feet MSL bounded on the north by Glendale Avenueand Indian Bend Road, on the east by Gilbert Road, on the south by ChandlerBoulevard and an extension of Chandler Boulevard, on the west by LitchfieldRoad and the Agua Fria River. This airspace is needed to provide sufficientroom for vectoring aircraft arriving and departing the Phoenix Sky HarborInternational Airport.3. That airspace north, east and south of Phoenix Sky Harbor InternationalAirport extending from 4,000 feet MSL to and including 10,000 feet MSL,excluding that airspace described in paragraphs 1 and 2, bounded on thenorth by Thunderbird Road, on the east by a 20-mile arc from the ILS localizerantenna and the Williams 1 MOA, on the south by Riggs Road and an extensionof Riggs Road, on the west by the Gila River until intercepting an extensionof Chandler Boulevard, then an extension of Chandler Boulevard until interceptingLitchfield Road, then Litchfield Road until the Agua Fria River. This configurationtakes into consideration the terrain and is necessary to provide additionalairspace for aircraft on downwind, and for approaches and departures tothe north.4. That airspace north and south of Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airportwithin a 20-mile radius extending from 6,000 feet MSL to and including10,000 feet MSL, excluding that airspace described in paragraphs 1-3. Thisarea is utilized extensively for departures to the north and south. Withinthis area a mix of traffic exists due to operations to/from airports inthe Phoenix terminal area.5. That airspace within a 25-mile radius of Phoenix Sky Harbor InternationalAirport extending from 8,000 feet MSL to and including 10,000 feet MSL,excluding that airspace described in paragraphs 1-4; and that airspacewest of Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport extending from 6,000 feetMSL to and including 10,000 feet MSL bounded by an extension of ChandlerBoulevard clockwise until intersecting Camelback Road. This airspace isimpacted by high terrain and allows adequate airspace for nonparticipatingaircraft conducting VFR operations. This configuration would provide anarea to contain aircraft during climb and descent profiles while transitioningbetween the terminal and en route structure.The preceding general summary of the proposed TCA airspace configurationidentifies that airspace which is necessary to contain large turbojet aircraftoperations at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. ATC will providecontrol and separation of all flights within the proposed airspace boundaries.Furthermore, ACT authorization is requisite to aircraft operations withinthat airspace. Establishment of this TCA will greatly enhance the safetyof flight within the congested airspace overlying the Phoenix metropolitanarea by facilitating the separation of controlled and uncontrolled flightoperations. Section 71.403 of Part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulationswas republished in Handbook 7400.6D dated January 4, 1988. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Evaluation Summary</ITAG>The FAA is required to assess the benefits and costs of each proposed rulemakingaction to assure that the public is not burdened with rules whose costsoutweigh their benefits. The section contains an analysis which quantifies,to the maximum possible extent, the costs and benefits of establishingat TCA at Phoenix, AZ. This proposal is intended to lower the likelihood of midair collisionsby increasing the capability of the ATC system to separate all aircraftin terminal airspace around the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.This action was prompted by data indicating that a high percentage of nearmidair collisions reported to the FAA in terminal areas involve VFR aircraftthat are not required to be under the control of ATC. Thus, the overallobjective of this proposal is to substantially increase safety while accommodatingthe legitimate concerns of airspace users. Costs-Benefits Analysis <ITAG tagnum="81">a. Costs</ITAG>The FAA estimates the total cost expected to accrue from implementationof the proposed rule to be $1.2 million ($1 million, discounted) in 1987dollars. Approximately $471,000 (discounted) or 46 percent of the totalestimated costs would be incurred by the FAA primarily for training andadditional equipment. The remaining costs would be incurred by small GAaircraft operators who would be required under this proposal to equip theiraircraft with Mode C transponders sooner than they would have for the ARSAunder the previous FAA rule: ``Transponder With Automatic Altitude ReportingCapability Requirement (Mode C)'' (53 FR 23356, June 21, 1988). This rulebecame effective June 21, 1989, and will be implemented in two phases.Phase I, to begin in July 1989, will require a transponder with Mode Cat and above 10,000 feet MSL and in the vicinity (30 nautical miles) ofTCA primary airports. There are currently 23 TCA's. Phase II will implementa transponder with Mode C requirement in the airspace in the vicinity (10nautical miles) of ARSA primary airports. Phase II becomes effective onDecember 30, 1990, and will affect over 135 ARSA's. Also in Phase II, atransponder with Mode C will be required at other designated airports forwhich either a TCA or ARSA has not been adopted. Consequently, it wouldbe very difficult for any aircraft to fly without entering within 30 nauticalmiles of a primary TCA airport, within 10 nautical miles of a primary ARSAairport, or within controlled airspace of other designated airports thatwould also require Mode C transponders. Thus, this evaluation, as wellas the Mode C rule, assumes that all aircraft without Mode C would acquiresuch equipment rather than circumnavigate the subject airport. The onlyaircraft without this equipment would be non-electrical and antique types.Costs to these types of aircraft operators have already been accountedfor by the Mode C rule. As a result, aircraft operators impacted by thisproposal would only incur the opportunity costs of capital by requiringthem to acquire, install, and maintain Mode C transponders one and a halfyears earlier than they would be required to do so in accordance with PhaseII of the Mode C rule. <ITAG tagnum="81">b. Benefits </ITAG>This proposed rule is expected to generate potential benefits primarilyin the form of enhanced safety to the aviation community and the flyingpublic. Such safety, for instance, would take the form of reduced casualtylosses (namely, aviation fatalities and property damage) resulting froma lowered likelihood of midair collisions because of increased positivecontrol in airspace to be established by the TCA. In addition, potentialbenefits are expected to accrue in the form of improved operational efficiencyon the part of FAA air traffic controllers. Ordinarily, the potential benefits of this proposal would be the reductionin the probability of midair collisions resulting from converting the existingARSA to a TCA. However, because of the recent Mode C rule (and to someextent, the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance (TCAS) rule, 54 FR 940,January 10, 1989), the number of potential midair collisions avoided bythis proposal is expected to be significantly lower. Nevertheless, thisproposal is still expected to accrue benefits in terms of enhanced safety,though on a much smaller scale. This point can be illustrated with theuse of statistical models based on actual and projected critical NMAC incidentsin lieu of actual midair collisions. (A critical NMAC is an event involvingtwo aircraft coming within 100 feet of each other; the fact that they donot collide is not due to an action on the part of either pilot; but, rather,purely to chance.) Since midair collisions involving Part 135 aircarftand especially Part 121 aircraft are rare, the use of critical NMAC's willserve to illustrate, to some degree, the potential improvements in aviationsafety of implementing this proposal. Simple regression analyses were preparedfor this evaluation which focused on critical NMAC's and aircraft operationsin the 23 existing TCA's and in a random sample of 23 of the exisitng 79ARSA's (as of 1986 and 1987). The results of these analyses indicated thatTCA's have approximately 32 percent fewer critical NMAC's annually, onaverage, than ARSA's. While there is no demonstrated relationship betweenNMAC's and actual midair collisions, the lower NMAC rate does indicatea more efficient separation of aircraft in congested airspace.As the result of these findings, if the existing Phoenix ARSA were to remainunchanged (and the recent Mode C and TCAS rules were not in effect), thePhoenix Terminal Area would be expected to experience approximately 2.6critical NMAC's annually (or 41 critical NMAC's over the next 15 years).If, however, the ARSA were to become a TCA, this figure would reduce toapproximately 0.8 critical NMAC's annually (or 13 critical NMAC's overthe next 15 years). Thus, over the next 15 years, this proposal could resultin the reduction of approximately 28 critical NMAC's. However, it is importantto note that many, if not most, of these potential critical NMAC's wouldnever materialize as predicted primarily because of the ``Mode C'' ruleas it is applied to the Phoenix ARSA and, to some extent, the ``TCAS''rule.According to Phase II of the Mode C rule, all aircraft operating within10 nautical miles (except for flights under the outer 5-mile ``shelf'')of an ARSA primary airport must be equipped with the Mode C Transponder.Phase I of the Mode C rule requires, as of July 1989, aircraft operatingwithin 30 nautical miles of a TCA to be equipped with a Mode C transponder.These requirements are expected to significantly reduce the risk of midaircollisions in ARSA's and TCA's. For this reason, the primary safety benefitof this proposal to create a TCA in 1989 at Phoenix is that the safetyenhancements of the Mode C and TCAS requirements will occur one and a halfyears earlier than they otherwise would be expected without this proposal.A second safety benefit would be in terms of the lowered likelihood ofmidair collisions as the result of expanding the lateral boundaries ofpositive ATC by 20 nautical miles through replacing the Phoenix ARSA witha TCA. Thus, the safety benefits of the establishment of a new TCA, while positive,would be less than would otherwise accrue in the absence of the Mode Cand TCAS rules. Since this proposal essentially extends the effects ofthe Mode C rule, virtually all of its potential safety benefits are assumedto be part of that rule. Such benefits cannot be estimated separately and,therefore, are considered to be inextricably linked primarily to the ModeC rule. Over a 15-year period, the Mode C rule is expected to generatetotal potential safety benefits of $344 million (discounted, in 1987 dollars).(The Mode C rule benefits estimated of $310 million for 10 years has beenadjusted to a 15-year period for the purpose of comparability with theTCAS rule and other FAA rulemaking actions.) It is important to note thatpart of these safety benefits would be attributed to the TCAS rule. Thus,the potential safety benefits of this proposal, and the Mode C and TCASrules are considered to be inextricably linked. Another potential benefit of the proposed rule would be improved operationalefficiency on the part of FAA air traffic controllers. Under the proposedrule, Mode C transponder requirements would ease controller workload peraircraft being controlled because of the reduction in radio communications.It would also make potential traffic conflicts more readily apparent tothe controller. As the result of improved operational efficiency, the impactof the controller workload increased by separation requirements in theproposed TCA would be somewhat offset because of the controller's abilityto adjust the volume of VFR traffic in any given portion of the TCA. Improvedoperational efficiency should generate other types of benefits in the formof significant reductions in the number of VFR aircraft requests deniedand VFR aircraft delayed during busy periods. As the result of convertingthe existing Phoenix ARSA to a TCA, the improved operational efficiencywould accrue because of the additional equipment (such as flight data input-output,dedicated communication link, and video mapper). If the Phoenix ARSA wereto remain intact, such equipment would not be required. The potential benefitsof improved operational efficiency, which is not considered to be quantifiablein this evaluation, would be attributed to this proposal. <ITAG tagnum="81">c. Comparison of Benefits and Costs </ITAG>The total cost that would accrue from implementation of the proposed ruleis estimated to be $1 million (discounted, in 1987 dollars). Approximately,half of this total cost estimate would fall on those GA aircraft operatorswithout Mode C transponders in the form of opportunity costs by requiringthem to acquire such avionics equipment one and a half year sooner thanthey otherwise would under the status quo. The typical individual GA aircraftoperator impacted would incur an estimated one-time cost ranging from $120to $280 (discounted) under the proposed rule. The potential benefits ofthe proposed rule would be the lowered likelihood of midair collisionsfrom the conversion of the existing ARSA to a TCA. The number of midaircollisions avoided and their respective monetary values cannot be estimatedfor this proposal independent of the Mode C and TCAS rules, but the FAAbelieves the risk would be substantially reduced. An FAA analysis preparedfor this evaluation, however, has shown that critical near midair collisionsoccur approximately one-third less frequently ina TCA than within an ARSA.The FAA believes that even after the aviation community complies with theMode C and TCAS rules, locations converting from ARSA's to TCA's wouldcontinue to experience reduced critical NMAC's. In addition, the proposedrule would generate improved operational efficiency benefits on the partof FAA air traffic controllers, though they are not considered to be quantifiablein monetary terms. The Regulatory Evaluation that has been placed in the docket contains additionaldetailed information related to the costs and benefits that are expectedto accrue from the implementation of this NPRM. <ITAG tagnum="84">Initial Regulatory Flexibility Determination</ITAG>The Regulatory Fexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted to ensure thatsmall entities are not unnecessarily and disproportionately burdened byGovernment regulations. The RFA requires agencies to review rules whichmay have ``a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities.'' The small entities which could be potentially affected by the implementationof this proposed rule are unscheduled operators of aircraft for hire whoown nine or fewer aircraft. Virtually all of the aircraft operators impacted by this proposed rulewould be those who acquire Mode C transponder capability. The FAA believesthat all unscheduled aircraft operators (namely, air taxi operators) potentiallyimpacted by this proposed rule already have Mode C transponder due to thefact that such operators fly regularly in or near airports where radarapproach control service has been established. Even if some of these operatorswere to acquire, install, and maintain Mode C transponders, the cost wouldnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of them.The annual FAA threshold for significant economic impact is $3,700 (1987dollars) for a small entity. According to FAA Order 2100.14A (RegulatoryFlexibility Criteria and Guidance), the definition of a small entity, interms of an air taxi operator, is one with nine aircraft owned, but notnecessarily operated. If we were to assume that a particular aircraft operator had nine aircraftwithout transponders, then the one-time cost per aircraft would be approximately$243. This figure represents the annualized cost for each impacted aircraft.The total cost per small entity would amount to an estimated $2,187. Thus,the annual worst case cost for a small entity would fall far below theFAA's annual threshold of $3,700. Therefore, the FAA believes this proposedrule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">International Trade Impact Assessment</ITAG>The proposed rule would neither have an effect on the sale of foreign aviationproducts or services in the United States, nor would it have an effecton the sale of U.S. products or services in foreign countries. This isbecause the proposed rule would only potentially impact small GA aircraftoperators without Mode C, and not aircraft manufacturers. The averge costof acquiring Mode C capability is estimated to range from $900 (to upgradefrom a Mode A transponder) to $2,000 (to acquire a Mode C transponder withouthaving a Mode A transponder). The cost of acquiring Mode C capability isnot considered to be high enough to discourage potential buyers of smallGA airplanes. <ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Implications </ITAG>This regulation would not have substantial direct effects on the states,on the relationship between the national government and the states, oron the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levelsof government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, preparationof a Federalism assessment is not warranted. <ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion</ITAG>For the reasons discussed under ``Regulatory Evaluation,'' The FAA hasdetermined that this proposed regulation is not a ``major rule'' underExecutive Order 12291, and it is certified that this proposal, if adopted,would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities. This rule is considered a ``significant rule'' under DOTRegulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71 </ITAG>Aviation safety, Terminal control areas, Airport radar service areas. <ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me, the Federal AviationAdministration proposes to amend Part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations(14 CFR Part 71) as follows: <ITAG tagnum="56">PART 71_DESIGNATION OF FEDERAL AIRWAYS, AREA LOW ROUTES, CONTROLLEDAIRSPACE AND REPORTING POINTS </ITAG>1.
