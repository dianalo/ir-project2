On Wednesday, the Soviet Union said it would accept the court'sjurisdiction in six human rights treaties, reversing its policy ofresisting outside judgment of its practices.   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev also has spoken recently in favorof a larger U.N. role in such international areas as arms controland space exploration, which traditionally have been dominated bythe Soviet Union and United States.   U.N. and State Department legal officers said his acceptance ofjurisdiction by the World Court, a U.N. agency, will bring Gorbachevinternational good will with little risk of embarrassment overSoviet human rights practices.   It also should help the Soviet effort to hold a human rightsconference in Moscow in 1991 as one of several follow-up meetings tothe 1975 Helsinki agreements on European security and cooperation.   In January, Washington changed its position and said it wouldaccept a Moscow conference, citing the Soviet release of politicalprisoners, easing of emigration and more tolerant views on freespeech and freedom of religion.   The six treaties on which the Soviets will recognize the court'sauthority deal with five areas. They condemn genocide, ban slavery,guarantee political rights for women, prohibit racism and outlawtorture.   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the United Stateswelcomes ``any step in the submission of disputes of this kind tobinding decisions by neutral bodies such as the International Courtof Justice,'' the court's formal name.   Pieter Kooijmans, U.N. special investigator on human rights, saidin Leiden, the Netherlands: ``It would be a real breakthrough forhuman rights if the Soviet Union would recognize the right ofindividuals'' to file complaints of rights abuses.   Under the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant onCivil and Political Rights, individual citizens can complain ofrights abuses to an international body of legal experts with thepower to order compensation. Hungary ratified the protocol last year.   A State Department legal expert said privately: ``TheInternational Court of Justice has never handled a human rightsdispute'' and the Soviet acceptance of jurisdiction ``may amount tonothing more than a meaningless gesture.''   ``It would be unlikely that a human rights dispute would everwind its way to the World Court,'' he said.   Only governments can take cases before the court, which has 15judges and sits in The Hague in the Netherlands. It has no authorityto deal with complaints of individuals or private organizations.   The United States has ratified only one of the six human rightstreaties. The Soviets have accepted all six.   Last year, the Senate finally ratified the 1948 Convention on thePrevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, but rejectedWorld Court authority over its interpretation. The United States hassigned the five other treaties but the Senate has not ratified them.   ``We have accepted (World Court) jurisdiction over many moretreaties than the Soviet Union has, bilateral and multilateral,''the State Department legal expert said.   Washington accepts World Court rulings under about 60 treatiesdealing with a range of diplomatic and commercial rights. TheSoviets have refused to recognize the court's authority.   Last year, the United States, Soviet Union, Britain, France andChina began negotiations toward an agreement under which they wouldsubmit to World Court rulings on all treaties that did not involvesensitive national security issues or the use of force.   They are the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Counciland have veto power in the council.   The United States rejects World Court's jurisdiction in nationalsecurity cases.   In 1986, Nicaragua asked the court to rule on the mining of itsharbors and covert U.S. support for Contra rebels. The court ruledin Nicaragua's favor but the United States, which did notparticipate in the case, refused to accept the decision.</TEXT></DOC>
