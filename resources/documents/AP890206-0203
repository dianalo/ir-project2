Military records indicate 108 have been acquitted.   Sources close to the Judge Advocate General's Office predict mostof the accused will either be acquitted or receive light sentencesunless Mrs. Aquino applies pressure on the military justice system.   Military courts have charged at least 488 officers and enlistedmen with involvement in six coup attempts since Mrs. Aquino tookpower in an uprising against President Ferdinand E. Marcos inFebruary, 1986.   No reliable figures are available on the actual number ofsoldiers involved in the coup attempts, including a mutiny Aug. 28,1987, when at least 53 people were killed and more than 300 wounded.   But military officials say at least 2,000 mutineers took partthat last and the most serious attempted coup. Hundreds more wereinvolved in five others.   Many lower-ranking enlisted men were quietly released withoutcharge because they were simply following orders. Others escaped,including former Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, who led themutiny in August, 1987.   So far, the stiffest sentence _ 12 years at hard labor _ wasgiven to Col. Oscar Canlas, leader of the takeover of a privatetelevision station in Manila in January, 1987.   Although the sentence called for hard labor, sources close to themilitary say Canlas, who was convicted last May, is being held inrelative comfort _ with access to tennis courts and other amenities_ at a military garrison pending completion of a review of hisconviction.   In December, 41 soldiers were acquitted of taking part in anattack in April 1987 on Fort Bonifacio, headquarters of thePhilippine army. The military said they were freed because of lackof witnesses, although sources said prosecutors had sworn statementsfrom witnesses linking most of them to the attack.   The acquittals have led to charges in the Philippine press of amilitary whitewash. In a recent editorial, the independentPhilippine Daily Inquirer said the acquittals reflect an ``esprit decorps'' in the military that ``assumes the form of a closed club,the members of which in each other's eyes can do no wrong.''   A Western diplomat with links to the Philippine military said hesuspects the courts will go easy on defendants to avoid worseningfactionalism in the 160,000-member armed forces.   ``I don't think anyone will be put up against the wall,'' saidthe diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``There may be afew who get punished, but I suspect most will get off lightly in thespirit of national reconciliation.''   A military lawyer, also insisting on anonymity, acknowledged thatpersonal ties and the ``brotherhood of arms'' often influencecourt-martial boards, which are trying the soldiers.   ``Before we write our decision on that piece of paper, ourconscience asks us, `Can you live with this? Can you live with thethought that you sentenced a guy to be killed _ a guy in your sameuniform and the establishment?''' he said.   ``Then my heart tells me _ do this.'' He gave a thumbs up signfor acquittal.   In such an atmosphere, military lawyers say it will take pressurefrom the Aquino administration to overcome widespread sentiment foracquittals or light sentences.   Another military lawyer, also speaking on condition of anonymity,said the military justice system had become accustomed topresidential pressure during the 20-year Marcos administration.   He said that during some major trials in the 1970s, Marcoshimself would monitor proceedings via closed-circuit television andtelephone prosecutors with detailed instructions on arguing thecases.   ``That's not done now anymore,'' the lawyer said. ``But if they(in the Aquino government) want these guys convicted, they will haveto orchestrate it. Give us directives.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Tues AMs, Feb. 14</NOTE></DOC>
