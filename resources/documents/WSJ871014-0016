Damages will be awarded by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, which heard the case. Neill Taylor, a lawyer for Corning, said the Corning, N.Y.-based maker of specialty glass and ceramics, telecommunications and houseware products expects to collect &quot;several millions of dollars.&quot; Sumitomo said it probably would appeal.    Judge William C. Conner said in a 100-page opinion that Sumitomo infringed on two Corning patents for optical-waveguide fibers, hair-thin strands of glass used to transmit information by light. The judge rejected Sumitomo's arguments that the formula for the fibers, mostly used in telecommunications equipment, was &quot;obvious.&quot;    In fact, he said, Corning's patents, one issued in 1972 and the other in 1975, &quot;literally created a new industry of substantial size.&quot; Total world-wide sales of such optical-waveguide fibers reached about $600 million in 1986.    A third Corning patent that covered the process for producing the fibers was found not to have been infringed upon by Sumitomo. That ruling will allow the Japanese company, which has annual sales of more than $5 billion, to continue operating its Sumitomo Electric Research Triangle Inc. unit, which makes the fibers in North Carolina.    The U.S. facility, opened in 1984, has been running at full capacity, producing more than 100,000 fiber-kilometers annually, or about 10% of U.S. demand. Robert Swirbul, a senior vice president of the Sumitomo unit, said the company would continue to preform fiber products and also would keep placing the fiber in cables, the form in which it can be used by customers.    The court ruling, he said, only affects an interim step, known as &quot;drawing&quot; the fiber. To make up for that -- and to continue to serve the unit's 50 or so customers -- Mr. Swirbul said that Sumitomo was acquiring drawn fiber from suppliers that are licensed by Corning.    Sumitomo initiated the court process when it sought a judgment in 1984 to invalidate Corning's optical-waveguide patents. &quot;The judge has now drawn the boundary of the stadium,&quot; Mr. Swirbul said. &quot;Now we know where we're playing.&quot;    In a statement, Corning Chairman James R. Houghton called the court decision &quot;extremely important,&quot; saying it &quot;confirms the significance of the contribution that Corning has made to this technology.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
