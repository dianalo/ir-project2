IbrahimStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/20/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MDESTPETROLEUM (PET)MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) </IN><DATELINE> PARIS </DATELINE><TEXT>   Saudi Arabia has cut its oil production close to a record low level in the battle to keep oil prices up, according to oil industry sources.    Saudi production has fallen to about 2.5 million barrels a day, down nearly a million barrels a day from a month ago and close to its lowest-ever daily output of two million barrels in August 1985, say sources among major U.S. customers for Saudi oil.    Oil production by most other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, including Qatar, Nigeria, Iran, Libya and Algeria, has also fallen. But the strongest source of resistance to oil company pressure to sell oil below the OPEC-mandated price of $18 a barrel seems to be Saudi Arabia.    &quot;Saudi Arabia's King Fahd is by far the most prominent of OPEC leaders in the front line,&quot; notes Petrostrategies, a Paris-based trade publication. &quot;In all its 25-year history, this episode of resistance and sacrifice is by far the strongest demonstration of solidarity by OPEC,&quot; the publication's editor, Pierre Terzian, says in an interview here.    OPEC and industry sources confirm that the cartel is producing a little more than 14.5 million barrels a day, compared with an authorized OPEC ceiling of 15.8 million barrels a day.    Contributing to the shortfall appears to be unanimous OPEC resistance to sales of crude below the official price. Accidental interruptions of production, such as the earthquake that has halted Ecuador's entire oil output of 210,000 barrels a day, also have held down output.    Reliable sources said tiny Qatar hasn't been able to sell more than 65,000 barrels a day of an authorized OPEC quota of 285,000 barrels a day for the month of April. But a senior Qatari official, who asked not to be identified, said the country nevertheless will hold against all pressure &quot;because this is the political decision.&quot;    As a result, OPEC members are quickly devising plans to help their weaker members market oil in case the oil companies' challenge continues to erode their patience. Kuwait is reliably reported to be preparing to market Qatar's oil through its vast network of refineries and distributors in Western Europe.    &quot;OPEC certainly seems to have a winning hand at the moment,&quot; says Steve Turner, an oil analyst with Wood, McKenzie andamp; Co., a brokerage firm in Edinburgh, Scotland. He shares with other analysts and industry observers the view that OPEC's low production and high resolve are forcing oil companies to run down their oil inventories sharply.    Some analysts think the drawdown is running as high as 3.5 million barrels a day. Such a rate would eventually ease pressure on OPEC by forcing buyers to pay official prices to replenish supplies. &quot;If OPEC gets through March they are out of the woods,&quot; adds Mr. Turner. </TEXT></DOC>
