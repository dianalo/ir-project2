The battle broke out after soldiers discovered the guerrilla campin the Sierra de la Mararena region in the remote eastern plains,150 miles east of Bogota, Gen. Rafael Padilla Vergara, commander ofthe army's 2nd Division, said on the RCN radio.   He said the army found a clandestine landing strip and cocaplants, from which cocaine is cultivated, a sign the ColombianRevolutionary Armed Forces guerrillas and cocaine traffickers wereworking together in the area.   He said the soldiers also found an arms cache that had oncebelonged to the Colombian army. He did not say whether the weaponshad been stolen or captured.   Colombian guerrillas often forge alliances with drug traffickers,providing protection to the drug runners for a share of the hugeprofits.   ``Probably the landing strip is used for the transport of armswith the destination to guerrillas and the export of cocaine grownin this region,'' Padilla Vergara said.   The attack was the first since President Virgilio Barco announcedemergency measures Friday to fight leftist rebels, right-wingparamilitary groups and drug traffickers.   Barco promised to increase the security forces and stiffenpenalties for terrorist-related killings.   Colombian rebel armies have an estimated 10,000 members, and areblamed for more than 2,000 deaths and nearly 500 kidnappings thisyear alone.</TEXT></DOC>
