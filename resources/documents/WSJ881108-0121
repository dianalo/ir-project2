The selection also stirs speculation about a successor to Jack A. MacAllister, 62, the telecommunications concern's popular chairman, who is likely to retire in a few years.    At U S West, Mr. Ames already has wide experience in regulatory and financial areas. As the first treasurer of the regional company created by the breakup of the Bell System, he organized an information blitz on Wall Street, establishing an identity for U S West with securities analysts and institutional investors months before American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. sanctioned such visits.    In his new post as president of operations for U S West Communications Inc., Mr. Ames will be responsible for telephone operations in 14 states. Company officials say they are counting on his no-nonsense approach to carry out the unification of three business units -- Mountain Bell, Northwestern Bell and Pacific Northwest Bell -- that were consolidated last May.    Mr. Ames was involved in the company's controversial decision to scrap the 100-year-old Bell name of its telephone operations and to consolidate the three units into one. The Bell name had been a powerful point of contention since the breakup, with ATandamp;T fighting unsuccessfully for the right to use the Bell name as its own.    The appointment also underscores Mr. Ames's prospects for a top job at the parent some day. &quot;Clearly, Gary is the right age and on the right track to head to the top ranks of the company,&quot; says a U S West vice president.    Mr. Ames played an important role in building early awareness of the new company. Eleven months before the breakup of the Bell system, Mr. Ames ignored Ma Bell's directives that Baby Bells shouldn't approach Wall Street analysts and institutional investors until after the stock was issued and began trading. He began a 30-city road show for securities analysts six months before the stock began trading.    As treasurer, Mr. Ames orchestrated a plan to buy out small shareholders. It increased institutional ownership to about 36% from 17% for pre-divestiture ATandamp;T stock and cut costs for servicing shareholder accounts by $2 million annually. </TEXT></DOC>
