J. James Exon on May 27 was anythingbut routine.   The NRA, long considered one of Washington's most influentiallobbying organizations, never apologizes for the harsh attacks itmakes on lawmakers opposing its positions. But here was LaPierre _according to Exon's recollection _ admitting the group had gone toofar in attacking a senator who has been a longtime supporter of gunowners.   ``I think their influence has deteriorated some,'' said Exon. Andthe conservative Nebraskan's view is shared by the NRA's traditionalopponents, like Handgun Control, Inc., and NRA's more recentantagonists, the nation's major law enforcement organizations.   Exon, who parted with the organization over a bill to ban plasticguns that could escape detection at airport metal detectors, saidthat what he saw as LaPierre's apologetic tone reinforced hisconclusion.   But LaPierre, director of the NRA's Institute for LegislativeAction, denies his comments to Exon amounted to an apology, andrejects any view that the pro-gun group has lost a step.   ``Our base is as good as gold,'' LaPierre says. ``We're going tobe in good shape as long as there are 70 million Americans who ownguns and 25 million who hunt. There are 70 senators and 260 Housemembers who have never voted against us.''   But Exon described a different mood: ``They indicated to me theyhad fallen down badly in communications. They said they were goingto do everything they could to remedy that. They said they may haveover-reacted in the type of advertising and letter-writing to myconstituents.''   While Exon believes the NRA has lost influence by attacking itsfriends, the group's political opponents cite other reasons fortheir view. Among them:   _The NRA's switch from opposition to support of a bill to banundetectable plastic guns, legislation that is a top priority of guncontrol and police groups and is sponsored by NRA nemesis Sen.Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio.   The NRA changed its mind after police groups successfully lobbiedAttorney General Edwin Meese III to support their version of themeasure.   LaPierre says the NRA switched only after new language made clearthe bill would ban only still non-existent plastic handguns, notexisting metal pistols. ``A victory for the NRA,'' LaPierre says.   _A stunning gun control triumph in Maryland, where Gov. WilliamDonald Schaefer, in a ceremony with some 200 police officers, signeda bill May 27 to ban the sale of cheap handguns known as SaturdayNight Specials.   LaPierre said the NRA's supporters have begun an effort,successful in its early stages, to place a repeal referendum on theballot.   _The Minnesota Senate Judiciary Committee's defeat of anNRA-backed constitutional amendment proposal to clarify the right tokeep and bear arms. Also, the failure of the NRA in Wisconsin to winpassage of legislation that would have prohibited local governmentsfrom passing any gun control law stricter than state law.   LaPierre contends that state legislatures passed 18 NRA-backedbills in 1986, 24 last year and 13 so far this year. ``There's onlyone gun control bill that's gone through, and that's in Maryland,''he says. ``It was our agenda being discussed in state legislatures,not the other side's.''   _In the 1986 congressional elections, not a single incumbenttargeted for defeat by the NRA lost his or her seat.   LaPierre: ``It's very tough to defeat incumbents in Congressthese days. Most members of Congress who vote for gun control are insafe districts and nobody's going to beat them. There are fewcompetitive districts left where the gun issue is the (major)issue.''   _In recent congressional battles and numerous state gun controlfights, the NRA and the organized police groups have clashedbitterly. This has given state lawmakers and members of Congress apolitical escape hatch, allowing them to oppose the NRA bysupporting their local police.   ``I don't see their relationship with police as ever being verygood again,'' says Jerald Vaughn, executive director of theInternational Association of Chiefs of Police.   LaPierre says he held meetings recently with ``three or four''members of Congress, ``people who we felt were confused'' over theearly version of the plastic gun bill. ``They're still friends ofthe NRA.''   LaPierre's view of his meeting with Exon: ``I view it asinformational. If information is fence-mending, and fence-mending isinformation, I guess you could interchange them.''   Vaughn says of the NRA, ``They are by no means out of thepicture, but there are signs their stranglehold on thisadministration and Congress is starting to loosen a bit. There's agrowing recognition in law enforcement the NRA is an organizationout of control. But politically, they're a savvy organization. Theymake sure they're never in a position of having to admit defeat.''   N.T. ``Pete'' Shields, chairman of Handgun Control Inc., says theentry of law enforcement groups into the fray has been crucial.   ``The NRA used to call us bleeding-heart communists, soft oncriminals,'' Shields says. ``Now, whole law enforcement community _the guys on the firing line on the street _ is behind it (the fightto control guns). It's not credible to think of those people asbleeding-heart, liberal communists.''</TEXT></DOC>
