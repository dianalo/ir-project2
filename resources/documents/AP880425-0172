Officials of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countriesand rival oil producers expressed cautious optimism that anagreement could be reached this week on joint measures to supportprices.   ``Any meeting between OPEC and non-OPEC (nations) is important,but this one is particularly so because prices seem to be weak,''said Indonesian delegate Subroto, a former oil minister.   He said all 13 countries participating in the meetings Tuesdaywere ``eager to do something'' to prop up prices.   World oil markets appeared to be taking a cautiously optimisticstance on the upcoming conferences.   In the European spot, or non-contract, market, the price ofBrent crude from the North Sea was up about 10 cents a barrel, at$17.25, in late trading, compared with last Friday's close. Traderssaid activity was light.   Futures prices also edged upward on the New York MercantileExchange, where contracts for June delivery of West TexasIntermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, closed at $18.40 perbarrel, up 10 cents from Friday.   Senior officials from Mexico, Colombia, Egypt, Angola, Oman,Malaysia, Brunei and China were to meet Tuesday and Wednesday withOPEC's price monitoring committee, comprised of the oil ministersof Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Venezuela, Nigeria and Algeria.   That is to be followed on Thursday by a meeting of all 13 OPECmembers.   Also in Vienna, though not expected to participate in the jointmeetings, was Kent Hance, a member of the Texas RailroadCommission, which regulates the state's oil production of 2 million42-gallon barrels a day. He has indicated he plans to meetindividually with ministers to discuss his concern aboutinstability in the oil market.   Mexico's oil minister, Fernando Hiriart Balderrama, toldreporters that Mexico was ready to accept a 5 percent cut in itsoil exports if other producers agreed to do the same. He declinedto be specific about how many, or which, others must go along.   Mexico exports about 1.4 million barrels a day of its totaldaily output of 2.9 million.   ``We know that it might be difficult to reach unanimity'' atthis week's meetings, Hiriart Balderrama said through aninterpreter. ``But we expect a substantial number of countries todo something similar'' to Mexico's proposed cut.   Together, the eight non-OPEC countries represented in Viennaproduce about 8 million barrels a day, compared with OPEC'sestimated output of between 17.5 million and 18 million barrelsdaily.   Industry analysts expressed doubt that this week's meeting couldreach a concrete agreement on OPEC and non-OPEC production cuts.But some said it could mark a turning point in OPEC's long andlargely unsuccessful campaign to win closer cooperation with rivalproducers.   The world's two biggest oil producers _ the Soviet Union and theUnited States _ were not invited to the Vienna meeting.</TEXT></DOC>
