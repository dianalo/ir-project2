(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Doug Ubelaker used to examineskeletons for clues to the way people lived thousands of years ago.Now he's trying to figure out from bodies found along highways howeight women died just months ago.   Using calipers to measure bones and clay to reconstruct faces,the Smithsonian Institution anthropologist brought here by afrustrated prosecutor has helped identify the victims, womenbetween ages 25 and 36 with histories of drug use or prostitution.A ninth body was sent to Ubelaker last week.   His work has not led to the arrest of a suspected serial killer.But he may have cleared an innocent man: Sources close to theinvestigation say his conclusion that two of the women weremurdered between mid-summer and late fall led prosecutors to ruleout a suspect who had been in jail on other charges.   An expert in the emerging field of forensic anthropology,Ubelaker, 42, is one of about 40 U.S. anthropologists who workregularly with police, applying knowledge of ancient skeletons tothe grisly business of solving murders.   ``Anthropologists like myself spend their careers looking at thebones of people who lived long ago, trying to figure out whatdiseases they had, how tall they were, who they were related to,what problems they had, how well they were adapted to theirenvironment,'' he said. ``It turns out, though, that the techniquesthat we use to study these past populations are the same as thoseneeded to analyze modern remains in criminal cases.''   Few anthropologists are willing to make the switch from coldscience to cold blood, which takes ``tremendous intestinalfortitude'' as well as keen observational skills, said Walter H.Birkby, a professor of forensic anthropology at the University ofArizona in Tucson.   Birkby, a pioneer in the field, got hooked when police found adecomposed body and took it to a University of Kansas laboratory in1962. At first, he was repulsed by the body, which was ``so ripethe officers couldn't put it in their car; they wrapped it in aplastic bag and tied it to the bumper.''   He and other graduate students boiled the remains to the bone,carefully measured the skeleton, and concluded it was a youngwoman, who had apparently been murdered. Birkby doesn't remember ifthe killer was caught; he does recall thinking, ``This is realdetective work.''   In cases in which a body is found mostly intact, police usuallycall in a forensic pathologist, a physician trained incrime-solving techniques. But if the body has decomposed and littleis left but a skeleton, they increasingly turn to someone with adoctorate in physical anthropology.   ``Other people may be better with flesh, but when it comes tobones, we're the experts,'' said Professor Alison Galloway, aforensic anthropologist at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville.   Forensic anthropologists can measure the width of pelvic bonesto determine sex, use microscopic pieces of a thigh bone tocalculate age, and make a clay model of a face based on the shapeof the skull.   Dental records still are one of the surest ways to identify abody, but they often are not available. So Birkby and othersdeveloped skull-photo superimposition, in which they project aphotograph of a missing person onto a skull to see whether it fits.   Although many Americans have mixed blood, Galloway said, itoften is possible to determine race _ black, white or Asian _ fromthe shape of the skull, teeth and leg bones. Blacks, for example,tend to have projecting jaw bones and ridges above the eyes. Whiteshave receding cheek bones and narrow noses, and Asians haveshovel-shaped incisors and more curved leg bones.   A careful examination of a skeleton often reveals not only thetype of murder weapon but also its precise characteristics. In aprevious Massachusetts case, Ubelaker told police he was nearlycertain, from some oddly chipped rib bones, that a young woman hadbeen killed by a long-bladed knife with a bent tip. A knifematching that description was later found near the murder scene.   Calculating when a person died is often trickier, involvingrough estimates of the rate of decay based on the body's locationand exposure to moisture, sun and animals, Galloway said.   In about 15 percent of the cases referred to him by the FBI,Ubelaker said, the remains aren't even human _ they are bones fromdogs or deer, oddly melted pieces of plastic, or something else.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for May 4</NOTE></DOC>
