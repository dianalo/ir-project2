Conservative scientific models predict about a 5% reductionin the amount of global ozone by the middle of the next century, withlarge local variations. The predicted global warming from increased emissionsof greenhouse gases will also have differing effects on local climateand weather conditions and consequently on agriculture. Although numerousuncertainties are associated with both ozone depletion and a global warming,there is a consensus that world leaders need to address the problems.The US Congress is now beginning to take note of the task. In this article,one representative outlines some perceptions of the problems and thepolicy options available to Congress.</TEXT></DOC>
