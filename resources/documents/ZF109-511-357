Actually, the jump from spreadsheet to workgroup applications isn't sofarfetched.andP;  Access bills 20/20 as the leading spreadsheet for multiuserplatforms.andP;  And the company, we're sure, has learned a lot about howapplications are used by a group of people.andP;  The company also has experiencein designing products for use on a network-rather than as an individual,standalone tool.andM;But enough of this.andP;  Whether or not Access has any business developing andmarketing groupware is immaterial.andP;  The company is doing just that.andM;DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL.andP;  About to be announced, but already shipping, ForWords isa full text retrieval package that runs on the VAX VMS platform and isdesigned for average end users rather than retrieval professionals.andP;  It wasdesigned to be low cost-for $10,000 a mid-sized mini license and easy to use,with the ultimate goal of making text retrieval-and, not incidentally,ForWords itself-a horizontal product.andM;High-Speed Indexes.andP;  Unlike the very sophisticated retrieval engines andapplications that are on the market, such as Verity's Topic and DigitalEquipment's Basis, ForWords does not use a database model.andP;  High-speedindexes are created with a disk overhead of between 10 and 30 percent overthe size of the document.andP;  Access explains that the overhead is so lowbecause the indexes are built from the original document rather than from acopy.andP;  Thus, the document does not need to be duplicated.andP;  In addition,indexes are updated incrementally (only changed documents are updated in theindexes) at a user-defined time (say, midnight).andM;The indexes are easy to create.andP;  The process is entirely menu based.andP;  Indexescan be specified as public or private.andP;  And workgroups can be establishedwith varying permissions by indexn-one, read only, or modify.andM;Searching.andP;  The full text can be searched, and the process is pretty speedy.andO;All die standard search criteria-wildcards, Boolean operators, and proximity,or phrase-searching-we supported, as are stop words (e.g., we would probablynot choose to index on &quot;Seybold&quot;).andP;  You can also search on documentinformation stored by the word processor such as date, author, etc.andM;Queries are made via much forms.andP;  ForWords provides a number of forms,including a simple form (for simple find this word&quot; type of requests) andseveral more specific forms, such as the mail form, which includes fieldslike &quot;to&quot; and &quot;cc&quot;.andP;  Users cannot create a customized form, but the expertform allows you to specify your own fields to be searched.andM;Complex search requests or queries can be named and saved, and they can beexecuted automatically.andP;  For example, whenever an index is updated, a newquery is run so that you can always have an updated list of documents meetingcertain criteria.andP;  Stored queries can be shared among users, as can theresulting lists of documents.andM;Automatic Notification.andP;  In the near future-this is one of Access'spriorities-you can be automatically notified via E-mail when your index haschanged.andP;  So, say you have an index of all documents that contain the word&quot;groupware&quot; and you automatically index all incoming items from a third-partynews feed.andP;  Whenever a new item on groupware is indexed, you will benotified.andP;  Pretty nifty !andP;  LIMITATIONS.andP;  At present, ForWords only worksunder VAX VMS, though the company is working on other platforms (no specificswere given).andP;  The product does not work under DEC-windows or any othergraphical user interface.andP;  The native ForWords interface is ring menus, orthe product release can be integrated into All-In-1.andP;  Access assures us thata product release will feature a GUI soon.andM;The product also supports only a handful of word processing formats at themoment.andP;  Admittedly, they are the most popular VMS formats: WPS+, Mass 11,WordPerfect, and WordMarc.andP;  Access is working on a DDIF (DECword) format.andM;There are also some non-intuitive steps in the process that need to beeliminated or rethought.andP;  For example, when you create an index, you specifywhich files (directory, file type, etc.) to index.andP;  When you're done, you cango away blithely thinking you're finished.andP;  But you're not.andP;  You have to thenspecifically submit-actually run-the index.andP;  We would like to see thesubmission process become part of the index creation step.andP;  When you finishspecifying the files, the system asks &quot;Do you wish to submit die index?&quot;andO;Don't make us remember to do it !andP;  But all in all, it's a good start for afirst release.andM;GROUP ANNOTATION.andP;  ForComment was developed several years ago by ELK andmarketed by Broderbund.andP;  It went nowhere fast.andP;  ELK now has an exclusivelicense with Access, which is also providing the continued development of theproduct.andM;ForComment is a group document review system that runs on the VAX under VMS.andO;A PC version for Noven networks is due out very soon.andM;The product allows multiple &quot;reviewers&quot; to edit a document submitted by the&quot;author&quot; to the system.andP;  &quot;Author&quot; is put in quotations marks because anyonewith permission can submit a document for review.andP;  Here's how the processworks:andM;The author submits the document toandM;ForComment explicitly indicating the word processing format of the document.andO;The author must also give the document a tide; the system cannot just pick upthe filename of the document.andP;  Access indicated that many users don't wanteveryone to know where the source document is located.andP;  We agree, but thinkthat there are also many users who don't care, and using the filename wouldsave time and effort.andP;  Documents may be submitted with a deadline for review,though this isn't required.andM;* Reviewers on the appropriate distribution list are notified by E-mail thata new document has been submitted for editing.andP;  The integration with E-mailis very impressive.andP;  The creation of the distribution list is lessimpressive.andP;  You cannot select die names from a menu, but must type in thename and network address for each member of the list Actually, this is adeficiency of the network management systems rather than ForComment, but itis nonetheless cumbersome.andM;* Reviewers can make comments (e.g., It good point, Charlie&quot;) or suggestrevisions (actually rewrite sections).andP;  Revisions can be swapped in-reviewerscan see how the revised text would look in context-without changing thedocument Comments and revisions can be nested.andP;  This means that a reviewercan comment on another reviewer's comments.andP;  Each comment is limited to about32 lines, but an infinite number of comments can be made.andP;  Each commentindicates who made it and when.andM;* When each reviewer has finished making edits, he or she makes the documentpublic&quot; or hands it off to other reviewers and the author.andM;* At the deadline date or at any time decreed by the author, the document canbe removed from ForComment.andM;* The author can then export any or all revisions into a new version of thedocument.andM;ForComment is a very useful tool.andP;  Like ForWords, it sports a ring menuinterface.andP;  But Access plans to bring the PC version to Windows asap.andP;  Theapplication is low price&quot;2,500 for a mid-sized mini license-though moreexpensive than ForWords.andP;  Pricing on the PC will be $1,000 for 10 users.andM;GROUPWARE AS ANCILLARY TOOLS.andP;  Access has an interesting and realisticphilosophy about group applications such as ForWords and ForComment.andP;  CarlNelson, president of Access, states that a customer's office system &quot;is agiven.andP;  You can't replace it or change it.andP;  You must become part of thelarger process.&quot; Both group offerings from Access demonstrate thatphilosophy.andP;  They work with all the common word processors on the specifiedplatform, and they don't make you change the way you create or storedocuments.andP;  ForWords and ForComment are simply tools that help groups ofpeople work together with documents created under their existing systems.andP;  Ohsure, we would like to see a GUI added and windowing, and more transparencybetween formats.andP;  And there is always more fine tuning that can be done tothe actual operation of the product.andP;  But, all in all, Access Technology hasdone an impressive job of facilitating the group process.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
