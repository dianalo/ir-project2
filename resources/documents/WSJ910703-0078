Though that subtle legalism hasgoverned the nation's labor relations for half a century, thenuance is lost on Dan Stidham.   &quot;What's the difference?&quot; demands Mr. Stidham, the localUnited Steelworkers union president here, who with 1,700others has been permanently replaced in a labor disputebetween the union and Ravenswood Aluminum Corp. &quot;It's thesame as if they came out and fired us -- either way we don'thave a job.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   At first glance, this eight-month-old labor dispute ismuch like any other in a small, one-factory town, withcousins and neighbors squabbling and local businessesstruggling. But this hamlet of 4,000 straddling the OhioRiver is also a symbol of an emerging national debate overthe hiring of permanent replacements for strikers.   Companies insist they sometimes must offerpermanent-replacement status to keep their businesses going.But labor groups, pointing to protracted strikes at GreyhoundLines Inc., Eastern Airlines and International Paper Co., saymanagement increasingly uses permanent replacements to breakunions and to thwart collective bargaining.   Now Congress is considering a bill that would amend theNational Labor Relations Act to forbid offering permanentemployment to replacements -- reversing a 1938 Supreme Courtdecision that gave companies that right. The bill, a versionof which is likely to pass the House, passed the Senate LaborCommittee but faces a difficult battle in the full Senate.   To legislators in West Virginia, the dispute offerscompelling evidence of the need for change in the law.&quot;Ravenswood is a miniversion of the national problem,&quot; saysU.S. Rep. Bob Wise, whose district includes Ravenswood. &quot;Thecompany appears at the bargaining table as required, but it'sdifficult to see what incentive there is to bargain if itthinks these replacement workers are permanent.&quot;   Like most townspeople here, Monsignor Sylvester Staud ofRavenswood's St. Matthew's Church says he doesn't know enoughto take sides in the dispute. (The company calls it a strike;the union dubs it a lockout.) But on the matter of permanentreplacements, the 76-year-old Roman Catholic priest preachesfirmly in Sunday sermons to both management and labor: &quot;Theposition taken by management to hire permanent replacementworkers is nothing short of immoral.&quot;   Ravenswood's top executive says the union left him nochoice. &quot;I get upset when I'm called a union buster or whenthis is called premeditated,&quot; says Chairman R. Emmett Boyle.He says he warned the union that &quot;our responsibility tobankers and customers will drive us to run the facility in astrike.&quot; After failing to win enough recruits by offeringtemporary status, the &quot;only way I could do it was withpermanent-replacement workers.&quot;   It all began about a year ago, months before the laborcontract expired, when Ravenswood began installing newsecurity cameras and clearing brush from the hillsidebordering the plant to remove sniper cover. (Mr. Boyle saysthis was only after the union refused his offer for earlynegotiations.) The company told its unionized security guardsthat they must become salaried employees or be transferred toproduction jobs. It installed steel plates to protect theplant's electrical equipment from bullets and hauled intruckloads of food and supplies so managers could resideinside the plant. Before negotiations began, Ravenswoodadvertised in Ohio for replacement workers, boarded itsfront-office windows and encircled the plant in barbed-wirefence.   Negotiations got under way Sept. 25. The company declaredan impasse on Oct. 31. The union says the company acted eventhough the union had narrowed the cost gap between the twosides by 80%. As soon as the contract expired Nov. 1, thetemporary replacements stepped in. Ravenswood met again withthe union but declared another impasse on Nov. 29 and soonafter gave permanent status to its temporary replacements --who now number 1,030 -- without first notifying unionworkers.   The union says the company made the replacements permanenteven though the Steelworkers withdrew over 20 demands. Theunion also charges that Ravenswood refused to bargain oncertain safety issues, though five workers had been killed inthe 18 months since current management bought the plant fromMaxxam Inc.'s Kaiser Aluminum andamp; Chemical unit. (Ravenswoodsays the deaths weren't because of management's negligence.)   &quot;This company has used permanent replacements in an effortto rid itself of the union,&quot; asserts Carl B. Frankel,associate general counsel for the Steelworkers. Not so,counters Ravenswood's Mr. Boyle, who led a buy-out of theplant in 1988 with two partners. He concedes that thecompany's position didn't budge much during negotiations butsays Ravenswood can't afford the rich labor contracts of itslarger rivals.   Mr. Boyle also maintains there remains an $80 milliondifference between the two sides' proposals over the life ofthe proposed three-year contract. &quot;I think that's animpasse,&quot; he says. Further, he argues, &quot;the history of thatunion indicated there was a strong possibility of a strike,&quot;given wildcat strikes in the past and the plant's 69% voteagainst ratification of the last contract with Kaiser in1988.   Since the dispute began, local businesses say sales havedropped by one-third, and clergy report shouting matches atservices. At weekly picnics for union faithful, many inattendance wear &quot;Scab Hunter&quot; T-shirts featuring the barrelof a gun. In front of the union hall, replacement workershang in effigy.   There has also been violence. The company won aninjunction limiting the number of picketers, claiming some2,000 acts of union violence, including bombings and barnburnings. A security guard lost an eye when a sniper's bulletpierced his windshield, though the union deniesresponsibility for this.   The real battle, however, is taking shape hundreds ofmiles from here, at the National Labor Relations Board inWashington. The board is investigating all union complaintsof unfair labor practices, and the union hopes to get theboard to render a verdict on the dispute this summer. If theunion proves the company bargained in bad faith, the workerscould get their jobs back. If not, the replacements willindeed be permanent.   But even if the union wins, the company would be allowedseveral rounds of appeal within the NLRB and in federalcourts -- a process that could last up to four years. Rep.Wise and the state's two U.S. senators called on LaborSecretary Lynn Martin to intervene, but she only offered tomonitor the developments. Meanwhile, the RavenswoodSteelworkers' unemployment insurance expires in August,leading some to worry that they will lose their war longbefore the legal battle is settled.   &quot;I've always got it in the back of my mind that we'll goback to work, but it looks pretty bleak now,&quot; says DavidBlas, a 42-year-old lab technician who has been replaced, ashe loads canned vegetables and other staples into his car atthe union's relief center. &quot;If we don't hear from the NLRB bythe fall, I don't know if we'll have another savior outthere.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
