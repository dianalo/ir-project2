By coaching one woman in office politics,Endymion helped her rise to senior vice president of afinancial services firm. Anne Ronce, who says she left asearch firm because high-level recruiters discriminateagainst women, started DataLine, a glass-ceiling newsletter.</LP><TEXT>   Catalyst, a women's group, tells executives that womenneed decision-making, not just staff, know-how to advance.But the group emphasizes the bottom line: Companies thatpromote women realize a business payoff in improved corporateperformance, says Catalyst Vice President Mary Mattis. Shecites Tenneco, which gives its managers bonuses for promotingwomen.   McDonnell Douglas studied policies of 20 other firms; now,it will take steps such as having each top executive serve asmentor for two women or minority staffers.                                                                                                          NEW IRS RULES will restrict employers' 401(k) flexibility.   The regulations won't permit the &quot;restructuring&quot; ofemployees into groups for nondiscrimination testing after1991. Under the 1986 tax law, tax-deferred contributions byhighly paid employees in 401(k) retirement savings plans arelimited by the deferral level chosen by other workers. Lastyear, the IRS had allowed firms to break employees intogroups and test each by itself.   &quot;The government giveth and the government taketh away,&quot;says Henry Saveth, of consultant Foster Higgins. But now, thesums the IRS will let employees withdraw for hardships can be&quot;grossed up&quot; to cover taxes. And the withdrawals may be madefor college tuition payments for 12 months, not just the nextterm.                                                                                                          SEARCH FIRMS do poorly in hiring minority recruiters.   While headhunters are using more women, they lag theirclients in minority staffing, says Minneapolis searcherChristopher Polson. &quot;We're woefully behind,&quot; says BoydenInternational's Putney Westerfield, partly because minoritiesdon't want to be recruiters. Arnold Huberman, a New Yorkheadhunter, says searchers &quot;mirror&quot; all-white executivesuites from which they recruit. But Goodrich andamp; Sherwood hasfour minority consultants. Without minority members on staff,asks Roger Kenny, a New York recruiter who employs twominority staffers, &quot;how can we advise clients on hiringminorities?&quot;   Some clients, while recruiting women and minorities, stillthink white men are more competent, says Lynn Bignell, ofGoodrich andamp; Sherwood.                                                                                                          NO SHARDS WANTED? There's no significance, aides say, inLabor Secretary Lynn Martin's news-conference vow to&quot;dismantle&quot; the glass ceiling over women and minorityexecutives. She did say later it's time &quot;to tear down, todismantle, to remove, and, yes, to shatter&quot; the barrier.                                                                                                          A U.S.-CANADIAN salary gap is widest at the top, a TowersPerrin study shows. A typical U.S. chief executive got$400,000 in compensation in 1990 and a chief financialofficer about $205,000, compared to $260,000 and $122,000,respectively, in Canada. The gap is just 8% for clerks.                                                                                                          IT'S A MUST: Fully 70% of 1,000 Americans in an EmployeeBenefit Research Institute-Gallup Organization poll saidbenefits are &quot;very important&quot; when considering a job offer,up from 57% last year. Some 57% wouldn't take a job withouthealth insurance. Those with health coverage say they'd needa $4,096 pay hike to give it up.                                                                                                          SMALLER EMPLOYERS with health plans won't drop them,judging from a survey of 1,825 companies by consultant GrantThornton. Despite soaring costs, most firms said the benefitis vital to attract workers. But 51% of 464 firms paying allthe premiums will likely make employees share them by 1993.                                                                                                          EMPLOYERS INNOVATE to cut health expenses.   Texas Utilities gave the task to a 63-employee group; itranked 16 methods -- from flexible spending accounts todropping year-end carry-over of deductibles. The firm adoptedthe top nine, with estimated $9 million savings this year. Inone approach, if workers find errors in hospital bills, theyget half the savings up to $500.   Nynex pares administrative costs by paying Empire BlueCross/Blue Shield on a per-capita, rather than claims-cost,basis. Nynex and Fleet/Norstar Financial Group contract withvendors for mail-order drugs or health services. FidelityInvestments urges employees to put some profit-sharing moneyinto a retiree medical-benefit fund. Merrill Lynch paysdoctors to review other doctors' medical-procedurerecommendations.   Baker Hughes helps stop premium rises by giving $100 toworkers who score high in a wellness check; it chargessmokers $10.                                                                                                          THE CHECKOFF: How's that again? Human resources policiesare &quot;living and breathing organisms,&quot; says a CommerceClearing House newsletter. . . . Citing better earnings,Burlington Air Express gives back $1.3 million it dockedworkers in four- and five-day layoffs in January. . . .Pennsylvania state employees, their pay held up for severalweeks in a budget delay, are offered a free day-pass toHersheypark, an amusement park.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          LYNN TENDLER BIGNELL is principal and co-founder ofGilbert Tweed Associates, an executive search company.
