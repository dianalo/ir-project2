Perelman, isweighing a possible takeover of ailing First City Bancorp. ofTexas, according to people in the banking industry.   First Gibraltar, which itself benefited from a federalbailout in 1988, has sent a team of examiners to study thebooks of First City, which last week announced it needs toraise at least $200 million in new capital, the people said.First City has said it would explore a range of options,ranging from a cash infusion to a merger with a more stronglycapitalized institution.</LP><TEXT>   Spokesmen for the thrift and for First City declined tocomment. But Randall Meyer, a First Gibraltar executive vicepresident, was taking telephone calls yesterday at a FirstCity telephone number.   A First City official confirmed that First Gibraltarofficials are in the bank, but said he isn't sure whetherthey are acting on behalf of the thrift or on behalf ofGerald J. Ford, First Gibraltar's chairman. In addition tohis duties at First Gibraltar, Mr. Ford has invested inseveral banks in Texas and New Mexico.   The First City official, who requested anonymity, addedthat several other groups have contacted the bank aboutpossibly investing in it. &quot;It's amazing the number of peoplewho are interested,&quot; he said.   First City, which was recapitalized in 1988 in a federallyassisted transaction led by A. Robert Abboud, has fallen ontough times in recent months. It lost $158.3 million, or$9.87 a share, in 1990, and said it expects to beunprofitable in 1991, as well. Mr. Abboud was ousted aschairman and chief executive last week, and the companyannounced four of its bank units have inadequate capital andmay become subject to regulatory sanctions.   Meanwhile, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. lowered its rating onFirst City's $102 million preferred stock to single-C fromtriple-C, following a missed dividend payment March 31. Therating agency also lowered the ratings on First City's seniordebt to single-B-minus from double-B-minus, subordinated debtto triple-C from single-B, and commercial paper to single-Cfrom single-B.   It said the reductions reflect First City's continuedasset quality-induced losses, which continue to erode thecompany's capital base.   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchangeyesterday, First City common shares fell 50 cents to $3.50.</TEXT></DOC>
