(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Federal officials plan to shootand poison up to 1,500 ravens in the Mojave Desert in an effort tosave the desert tortoise, which is a favorite meal of the predatorybirds.   Animal damage control officers with the U.S. Department ofAgriculture will kill ravens by injecting hard-boiled eggs withpoison and placing the eggs on elevated platforms where the ravenswill find and eat them.   The ravens are killing young tortoises by the thousands andcontributing to an alarming decline of tortoise populations in thedesert, said biologists with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management,the agency that developed the raven control program.   Bureau of Land Management officials obtained a permit this weekfrom the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to kill the birds, the SanBernardino Sun reported Tuesday.   The birds are protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Thepermit represents the largest sanctioned killing of ravens in theWestern states, said Agent Tom Riley of the Fish and WildlifeService.   National Audubon Society officials oppose the program and localAudubon officials called it short-sighted and excessive.   ``I'm a little annoyed at this,'' said Bob McKernan, presidentof the San Bernardino Valley Audubon Society. ``In general the BLMis not doing its job throughout the desert on a variety of levels.... It bothers me that they are now having to go to these extremesto eliminate or reduce a population.''   Roads, dumps, homes, power lines and sewage plants in the deserthave helped boost raven populations 15-fold during the last twodecades, BLM biologists said.   The $50,000 raven control program, set to begin within the nexttwo weeks, will last about four months and will be conducted inthree areas, including the Desert Tortoise Natural Area preservenear California City, said Ted Rado, a wildlife biologist with theU.S. Bureau of Land Management.   The bait platforms, at least four feet high, will prevent otheranimals such as kit foxes and coyotes from eating the poisonedeggs, Rado said.   Ravens die within 24 to 48 hours after eating the poison.Officials plan to shoot ravens and capture some with nets firedfrom cannons to supplement the poisoning program.   Ravens favor tortoises seven years old and younger because theirfingernail-thin shells are easily punctured with their beaks. Asmore and more young tortoises are eaten, fewer reach maturity andthe adult reproductive population shrinks.   In two studies, BLM biologists attributed 88 percent of tortoisedeaths to ravens. But critics remain skeptical that ravens cancause so much damage.</TEXT></DOC>
