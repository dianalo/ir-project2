Jackson, who ranked ninth last year in the magazine's list ofthe 40 best-paid celebrities, moonwalked his way past Bill Cosby toNo. 1 by raking in an estimated $60 million this year, the magazinesaid in its Oct. 3 edition.   Jackson is expected to earn a total of $97 million for 1987 and1988, Forbes said   The 30-year-old entertainer made approximately $40 million fromhis recent worldwide tour, with the rest coming from sales of hisalbum ``Bad,'' his autobiography, ``Moonwalk,'' Pepsi endorsementsand other music publishing, the magazine said.   Cosby, who topped last year's list with 1986-87 income of $84million, was No. 2 on the current list with $92 million in earningsfor 1987 and 1988, Forbes says.   The youngest entertainer on the list was 22-year-old heavyweightboxing champion Mike Tyson. Tyson's earnings skyrocketed from $10million in 1987 to approximately $45 million this year, the highest1988 income behind Jackson's, the magazine estimates.   Two other boxers, Sugar Ray Leonard and Michael Spinks, made thelist, with $27 million and $17 million, respectively, in earningsfor the two-year period.   In contrast, the income of America's top-grossing executive,Charles Lazarus of Toys R Us Inc., averaged $31.5 million a yearfor 1986 and 1987, the most recent two-year period for whichexecutive pay records are available. Lazarus made $60 million,including about $56 million in one-time stock gains, in 1987.   In addition to Jackson, the top 10 wealthiest celebrities andtheir two-year incomes are:   _Bill Cosby, actor, $92 million.   _Steven Spielberg, movie maker, $64 million.   _Sylvester Stallone, actor, $63 million.   _Eddie Murphy, comedian and actor, $62 million.   _Charles M. Schulz, Peanuts cartoonist, $62 million.   _Bruce Springsteen, rock star, $61 million.   _Mike Tyson, heavyweight boxing champion, $45 million.   _Madonna, singer and actress, $46 million.   _Arnold Schwarzenegger, actor, $43 million.   The magazine notes that the top 10 averaged at least $21 millionfor each of the last two years. Lazarus was the only businessexecutive to exceed that average. Chrysler Corp.'s Lee Iaccoca cameclose with an average annual income for 1986 and 1987 of $19million.   Thirty other entertainers were included on the list, with FrankSinatra pulling in the rear with $16 million, the minimum two-yearincome needed to qualify for this year's list.   Forbes also notes that in death, perhaps more so than in life,entertainers continue to fill pocketbooks as well as hearts.   Elvis Presley's estate, for example, will earn approximately $15million this year, including $11 million from Graceland Mansion,the home Presley purchased in 1957 for $100,000 that now is amuseum honoring the entertainer.   Other dead entertainers whose estates are making in excess of $1million annually are Ian Fleming, author of the James Bond series,$7.5 million; John Lennon, ex-Beatle, $5 million; Jimi Hendrix,guitarist, $4.0 million; T.S. Eliot, poet and author, $2.5 million;and James Dean, actor, $1.2 million.   The Forbes Top 40 ranking includes five women. In addition toMadonna, the list contains Oprah Winfrey, Whitney Houston, TinaTurner and Jane Fonda.   The magazine also noted that 25 percent of those on the list areblack.   Forbes says the list knows no international borders and shows anevolving culture, with 17 of the top 40 in the music business.   ``No longer are steel mills or auto factories or oil wells theprincipal sources of great wealth,'' it says. ``In thepostindustrial society, the once despised entertainment industryhas usurped that role.''</TEXT></DOC>
