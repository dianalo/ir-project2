Broadening was found analyticallyto be proportional to r/sup -2(m+1)/, where r is the radial distanceand m is the potential parameter. The 70 keV B/sup +/-FIB profile wasmeasured resist exposure. The experimental results provide qualitativesupport for the present analytical method. Other causes for FIB broadeningare also discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
