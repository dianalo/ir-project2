Apple Computer wins one for the many companies battlingthe IRS over the poorly defined standards for earning creditsfor increased spending on research. Apple researchersexercised stock options at discounts totaling $29.6 millionin 1982-83, and Apple treated the discounts as taxable wages.The IRS agreed -- yet it wouldn't let Apple add the discountsto wage costs used in figuring the credits. Options reflectthe stock market, not research, it argued.</LP><TEXT>   Now Judge Jacobs says Congress clearly meant to includeoptions in research costs. Further, he says, the discountscount even if the options were granted before the credit wasenacted and even if they weren't exercised in the years whenthe workers did the research. &quot;The court rejected each of theIRS's arguments,&quot; says Apple's tax director, Eric Ryan.   Pending tax bills would extend the research credit, whichexpires June 30.                                                                                                          A SHOWDOWN ENDS in a standoff, as art experts try toauthenticate a Russell.   In 1969, George O. and Emelia A. Doherty of Missoula,Mont., paid $10,000 for a painting, Attacking Stagecoach,attributed to the great Montana artist Charles M. Russell. In1982-83, they gave the oil to the Russell Museum in GreatFalls -- and wound up in the Tax Court. They claimed acharitable deduction of $200,000, but the IRS termed the worka forgery valued at no more than $100. Facing off in courtwere two of the foremost experts on Russell.   Backing a $200,000 valuation, Ray W. Steele, the museum'sretired director, said the work is hasty, rough and unlikeother Russells, but not a forgery. Yet Ginger K. Renner, anarchivist, said the crude work couldn't possibly beauthentic. Faced with this dispute, Judge Parr refused torule on authenticity. But in view of the dispute and the poorquality, she valued the work at $30,000, a price that one ofRussell's worst paintings might have brought.                                                                                                          PAYROLL-TAX DEPOSITS could become simpler for 5.1 millionemployers.   Businesses forward $850 billion a year in withheld incomeand other taxes to the IRS, using checks and 80 million paperdeposit coupons. It's a costly system, plagued with errors,delays and penalties. But next month in Georgia, SouthCarolina and Florida, the IRS plans to begin tests in whichbusinesses will volunteer to make deposits electronically byphone. Many states build interestbearing bank balances fasterby requiring electronic tax transfers, which also are moreaccurate and efficient.   The IRS has more ideas to ease payrolltax burdens.Employers, banks and others file a billion W-2 wage and Form1099 payment reports a year; 50 million have faulty IDnumbers for recipients. This year, the IRS plans to start aservice allowing filers to phone its computer center toverify the ID numbers. Another test, planned for some statesin 1993, will allow employers to send W-2 data electronicallyto a single national center for redistribution to the IRS,Social Security and the states.   The IRS supports several measures in the pending tax billsto simplify the rules for payroll-tax deposits.                                                                                                          NEW BUSINESSES often fall behind in payroll-tax deposits,the IRS says. To spur voluntary compliance, its St. Louisoffice offers workshops to new or small delinquent employersthat have been penalized. If an employer attends, the IRSabates penalties for the three prior quarters.                                                                                                          LET STOOLIES STEW, the Senate Finance tax bill says. Thebill would make it a crime for federal agents to offerforgiveness of taxes to induce lawyers, CPAs or practitionersknown as enrolled agents to inform on their clients.                                                                                                          VENGEFUL PROTESTERS tried to harass IRS agents and othersa few years ago by falsely reporting huge income payments tothe targets. Congress's tax bills would let victims of suchreports bring civil damage suits against their tormentors.                                                                                                          MIXED-UP MATCHING of third-party reports is challenged bythe tax bills.   The IRS relies on computerized matching of these reportswith returns to spot discrepancies on the returns. But lastJune, appeals judges awarded a victory to Ramon Portillo ofEl Paso, Texas, who disputed a Form 1099 income report thatthe payer didn't substantiate. Mismatches may justifytax-deficiency notices, the court said, but a mismatch byitself doesn't carry the usual presumption of correctnessthat imposes the burden of proof entirely on taxpayers.That's a ruling the IRS doesn't like.   Now Congress is drawing on the ruling to advancetaxpayers' rights -- yet its bills differ significantly. TheSenate Finance bill would direct the IRS to present&quot;reasonable&quot; additional evidence in court if a taxpayer madea reasonable challenge to a third-party report. The Housebill would require the IRS to take &quot;reasonable steps&quot; toverify a disputed report -- but adds that failure to do sowouldn't nullify the deficiency notice. The latter part ofthe House provision angers Rep. Schulze (R., Pa.).   The effect of the conditioned provision would be toreverse the victory that Portillo had in court, Schulzecontends.                                                                                                          BRIEFS: The Senate Finance bill would extend through Sept.30, 1998, an expiring law that lets the IRS disclose tax datato the Veterans Affairs Department to help it determinebenefits. . . . South Dakota legislators passed a lawclassifying ostriches, emus and rheas as poultry; that wouldestablish a sanctuary from the state sales tax forflightless-bird ranchers.</TEXT></DOC>
