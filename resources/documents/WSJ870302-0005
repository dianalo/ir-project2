The rise in the Labor Department's consumer price index followed a 0.2% increase in December. Prices increased 1.1% in all of 1986. Energy prices surged 3% in January after a 0.2% drop in December. The department said energy accounted for about one-third of the overall January rise.    Separately, the Commerce Department said the nation's merchandise trade deficit widened to $14.78 billion in January from a revised $12.73 billion in December. Because there is a delay in reporting import figures, department statisticians caution against comparing revised figures with original ones. The agency originally put the December deficit at $10.66 billion.    The deterioration included a swelling in the deficit for manufactured goods to $12.82 billion from $9.76 billion and a widening of the U.S. trade gap with Japan, Canada and Western Europe.    The effect of the dollar's decline showed up in the unexpectedly sharp rise in prices, which excluding energy, was 0.5%. The fall in the dollar, which has dropped sharply against major currencies in foreign-exchange trading for the past two years, makes imports more expensive, allowing domestic producers to raise prices, too. This benefits manufacturers but means higher prices for consumers.    &quot;This is not a good report,&quot; said Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting project at Georgia State University. &quot;We're starting to get increases where we didn't have them before. It's got to be dollar-related.&quot; He said that while the size of the January price increase wasn't a surprise, most analysts expected more of the rise to be a reflection of energy prices.    Lyle Gramley, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association, said, &quot;The increased import prices are finally beginning to show up in a more significant way in retail prices.&quot;    Apparel prices rose 0.4% in January after being unchanged the month before; housing was up 0.5% after a 0.2% rise; medical care rose 0.4% after a 0.7% increase, and food increased 0.5% after a 0.2% rise. Excluding food and energy, which tend to vary widely from month to month, the index rose 0.5% after a 0.2% increase in December.    Transportation costs, reflecting a 6.6% rise in gasoline prices, rose 1.5% after being unchanged in December. Fuel oil prices posted a 9.8% increase, the biggest since an 11.9% rise in January 1974.    The overall 0.7% increase in prices was the biggest since a 1.1% increase in June 1982.    Effective with the January figures, the department has updated the index to reflect changes in consumer spending patterns and shifts in population. The new index is based on consumer spending patterns in 1982-1984 and the geographic distribution of consumers in the 1980 census. The previous index was based on 1972-1973 spending patterns and the 1970 census.    The index figures are seasonally adjusted. For comparison purposes, the department said the revised index rose 0.6% before adjustment in January while the old index increased 0.8%.    The index for urban wage earners and clerical workers, a measure that includes half the number of people covered by the all-urban index and is used in adjusting Social Security and other retirement benefits, increased 0.7% in January after rising 0.2% in December. On an unadjusted basis, this index rose 0.6% to 327.7% of its 1967 average and stood 1% above a year earlier.    The effect of the dollar's drop on the trade figures is ironic. Higher import prices ultimately will help narrow the trade deficit by leading individuals and businesses to choose domestic goods over foreign items. Buying patterns are slow to change, however, and so far the rise in import prices means the U.S. will continue to run up a big import bill even if volume is no longer rising.    &quot;Even if we experience underlying improvement in quantity terms, we can't realistically expect to see monthly trade deficits of less than $14 billion to $15 billion for some time,&quot; said Mr. Gramley. As a result, he said he didn't consider the latest report discouraging.    Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers, said, &quot;The dollar decline is good in the long run. It hurts the import bill in the short run.&quot; He said the trade balance is also being hurt by slow growth abroad.    The economists cautioned against reading too much into the trade figures, which are notoriously unreliable. Starting with the February figures, the department is going to delay release of the monthly merchandise trade reports to await better data.    In addition, the figures aren't adjusted for seasonal variation. Lawrence Kreicher, an international economist at Irving Trust Co. in New York, said that January is typically one of the weakest months for exports.    Democrats seized on the report to blast the Reagan administration's trade policy. &quot;Our trade situation is off to a bad start again in 1987,&quot; said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas), chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. &quot;In spite of the recent claims by some in the administration, few in Congress advocate a 'Rambo' approach to trade, but it's obvious that the ineffectual 'Mr. Peepers' style of this administration isn't doing the job.&quot;    The report showed that imports rose 7.1% to $31.16 billion from the $29.09 billion originally reported for December. Revised December imports totaled $31.25 billion. Exports fell 11.1% to $16.38 billion from the originally reported $18.43 billion. Revised December exports totaled $18.52 billion.    Imports of petroleum and related products rose 12.9% in January to $3.04 billion from $2.69 billion in December, and the average price per barrel rose to $14.87 from $13.90. By volume, shipments rose 5.5% to 204.16 million barrels from 193.43 million.    The U.S. trade deficit with Japan swelled to $5.16 billion from $3.83 billion in December. The gap with Western Europe widened to $2.41 billion from $2.25 billion and, with Canada, to $1.64 billion from $1.18 billion. The deficit with Mexico narrowed to $398.3 million from $456.4 million.    Meanwhile, Japan said its surplus on the current account grew in January from December, while West Germany said its January current-account surplus was unchanged from the average during the two preceding months. The current account comprises trade in goods and services, as well as some unilateral transfers.    In Tokyo, the Finance Ministry said the current-account surplus grew to a seasonally adjusted $8.83 billion in January from $7.91 billion in December. Before seasonal adjustment, the January surplus stood at $4.95 billion, up sharply from $1.88 billion a year earlier.    In Wiesbaden, West Germany, the Statistics Office said Germany's surplus on the current account grew to the equivalent of $2.68 billion in January, converting the mark at its current rate, from $2.46 billion a year earlier.    The U.S. has been pressing both countries to stimulate their economies so that they increase their imports.    The $14.78 billion U.S. trade deficit in January compares with a revised $14.42 billion in January 1986. Originally, the January 1986 deficit was put at $16.46 billion.    In a third report, the Labor Department said that the average weekly earnings of U.S. workers fell 0.3% in January, after adjustment for inflation and seasonal factors, following a 0.9% drop in December. The latest decline reflected a 0.1% increase in average hourly earnings and a 0.3% rise in hours worked.    Weekly earnings of U.S. workers averaged $306.40, after adjustment for seasonal factors but not for inflation, up from $305.17 in December. Before seasonal adjustment, weekly earnings fell to $305.47 from $308.17.    Here are the seasonally adjusted changes in the components of the Labor Department's consumer price index for January:                                      % change from                                 Dec.
