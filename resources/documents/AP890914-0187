In violence stemming from the Palestinian uprising, Israeliforces killed a suspected activist and reportedly wounded 25Palestinians in clashes.   In separate interviews, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir'sright-wing Likud bloc and its left-of-center coalition partner, theLabor party, debated Mubarak's plan.   Shamir, speaking in Herzeliya, urged the government ``to remainloyal toward its initiative'' for elections in the occupied WestBank and the Gaza Strip.   The official Israeli plan calls for elections in the occupiedWest Bank and Gaza Strip of Palestinian representatives for talkswith Israel. The 10-point plan proposed by Mubarak also urgeselections, but it differs by backing the idea of trading land forpeace and by saying Arabs in annexed east Jerusalem should vote.   Palestinians have so far rejected the official Israeliinitiative, and U.S. officials say Mubarak's plan could help revivethe stalled peace process.   In remarks Thursday, Shamir said any ``free initiative'' withinthe Israeli government could endanger its unity, the national newsagency Itim reported.   He also scheduled a second government meeting Friday on Mubarak'sproposals after a first session Wednesday reportedly ended indivision between his Likud bloc and the Labor Party.   According to reports from Cairo, Mubarak is trying to form aPalestinian delegation acceptable to both Israel and the PalestineLiberation Organization. Israel considers the PLO, which is helpingto organize the uprising, a terrorist group and refuses to negotiatewith its members.   The top Labor leaders, Finance Minister Shimon Peres and DefenseMinister Yitzhak Rabin, have said Israel should support Egypt'sefforts toward finding negotiators from the occupied territories.   Labor Parliament member Benjamin Ben-Eliezer said on army radioThursday that Shamir's plan and Mubarak's move ``together can be asolid enough basis to start negotiations.''   Both Israeli and Palestinian hard-liners attacked Mubarak's planThursday.   The Islamic fundamentalist movement Hamas, or Zeal, said in aleaflet distributed in the occupied lands that the plan should berejected as a U.S-backed initiative.   Two leading members of Likud, Industry Minister Ariel Sharon andHousing Minister David Levy, criticized Shamir and other top leadersfor even discussing Mubarak's proposal as an alternative to theIsraeli plan.   Sharon told Israel radio: ``There is no other plan, and there isno need for another plan.''   In Thursday's violence, a 28-year-old man wanted as an activistin the 21-month-old Palestinian uprising was shot and killed byIsraeli soldiers in the Deir Balah refugee camp in the occupied GazaStrip.   The army said troops opened fire on the victim, Mohammed ArafatAl-Akra, when he ignored orders to halt.   His death raised to 568 the number of Palestinians killed inclashes with soldiers and Israeli civilians in the revolt. Another114 Palestinians were slain by fellow Arabs as suspectedcollaborators with Israel. Forty Israelis also have been killed.   Twenty-five other Palestinians were shot and wounded Thursday inclashes with soldiers in the occupied lands, Arab hospital officialssaid.   The army command only confirmed three injuries.   In Jerusalem District Court, a Palestinian accused of slaying 16Jews by grabbing the steering wheel of a bus and forcing it into aravine pleaded guilty to murder.   However, Abdel Hadi Ghanem, 23, entered a plea of innocent to aseparate charge that the crime was premeditated.   Authorities say he was motivated by Palestinian nationalism, buthe reportedly told investigators he was avenging a beating of afriend by soldiers.   The July 6 attack was the worst against Jews in the Palestinianuprising.</TEXT></DOC>
