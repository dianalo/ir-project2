Negotiators resumed talks at a Manhattan hotel, according toJerry Borstel, a spokesman for the International Union ofElectronic, Electrical, Salaried Machine and Furniture Workers,which represents 40,000 GE workers.   GE's other national contract involves the United Electrical,Radio, and Machine Workers of America, which represents about 6,300GE employees.   Borstel declined to characterize the tenor of the talks, or tospeculate about when agreement might be reached.   But Borstel has said that if the talks produced no agreement bythe midnight EDT stroke deadline, the union was likely to give thecompany a 10-day strike notice instead of actually striking.   The unions are seeking a moratorium on plant closings, ano-layoffs guarantee, better early retirement benefits, strongerlimits on subcontracting and other job security improvements.   They also want wage increases in each year of the new contract,improvements in the cost of living formula, increases in pensionbenefits, improvements in health and hospitalization insurance,reimbursement for dependent care and prepaid prescription drugs.</TEXT></DOC>
