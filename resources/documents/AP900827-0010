(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Children don't play outside here in thesummer, and they go to school armed. Nearly everyone is enlisted inthe battle against Public Enemy No. 1 _ mosquitoes.   Williston, located at the confluence of the Missouri andYellowstone rivers, is a kind of mosquito mecca. The rivers createan ideal breeding ground for hundreds of thousands of the insects.   ``They're bad,'' says 23-year-old Kellee Cox, who moved to thearea from Fargo last spring. ``I can't believe it. I've got amillion mosquito bites.   ``I went into my back yard and got swarmed with them,'' shesays, revealing dozens of irritated red bites on her arms. ``Theyjust swarmed over me and attacked me like killer bees.''   It isn't a new problem; explorers Lewis and Clark complainedabout the bugs during their brief visits to the rivers' confluencein 1805 and 1806. A historian called a mosquito attack of 1947 theworst on record.   Some say the mosquitoes enjoy the predominantly Norwegian bloodof the town's 13,000 residents. Others have proposed getting rid ofthe bugs by building a bubble over the town or setting up huge fansto blow them away.   For years several agencies, including the impressive-soundingVector Control District board, labored unsuccessfully to put downthe insect uprising. ``Too many people were running the sameprogram,'' says Bill Cole, chairman of the vector board. ``Thingsweren't getting done.''   But a new idea emerged from a heated city meeting last summer atwhich residents were challenged to come up with their own ideas formosquito control.   Two housewives joined a pediatrician, two teachers and the ownerof a day care center to form the Bug Busters _ a volunteer groupthat studied ways to control the pests while protecting theenvironment.   They enlisted the local high school, a woodworking club and theArmy Corps of Engineers to make about two dozen mini-houses alongthe river, each designed to attract bats and sparrows _ naturalmosquito predators.   ``We're not importing bats or anything like that,'' said BugBuster Jackie Stenehjem. ``The bats are already here. We're justhoping they'll move out of town and move into the houses along theriver.''   Before the Bug Busters, the spraying of newly discovered larvaehad to be approved by several agencies, taking up to a week. Nowthe decisions are in local hands and extermination can start within10 minutes.   In April, voters approved an annual fee of $12 per household tohelp bolster mosquito control.   Despite a rough week or two, this summer generally was betterthan last. But children still stay mostly indoors and when theythey go to school, they take cans of bug repellent with theirpencils and notebooks.   Residents try to make the best of the bug situation, which theyrecognize is an unwinnable war.   ``It's a numbers game we're playing,'' Cole said. ``We just wantto get it down to where it's livable.''</TEXT></DOC>
