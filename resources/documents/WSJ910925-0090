The Treasury said it sold $13.19 billion of two-year notesat an average yield of 6.14%. The average yield was down from6.46% at the previous two-year note auction Aug. 27 and wasthe lowest average yield at a two-year note auction since5.87% on April 19, 1977.</LP><TEXT>   William Sullivan, director of money-market research atDean Witter Reynolds Inc., said the two-year note sale wasviewed as a &quot;good to excellent&quot; auction. Indeed, prices ofthe two-year notes actually rose after the auction, while theyield slipped to lower levels.   Analysts said investors were attracted to the two-yearnotes, in part, because they are betting that the notes willappreciate handsomely in the weeks and months ahead if theFederal Reserve reduces interest rates further. Many analystsbelieve that the Fed will lower rates in an effort tostimulate the economy, which is growing but at a very slowpace.   One interesting aspect of yesterday's two-year noteauction was the decline in the number of notes awarded tobidders in the New York Federal Reserve district. Bond marketparticipants say the decline may reflect a change in biddingbehavior resulting from the Salomon Brothers Inc. biddingscandal. Salomon Brothers is a unit of Salomon Inc.   Typically, the bulk of the Treasury securities sold atauctions go to dealers in the district covered by the NewYork Federal Reserve Bank. But of the $13.19 billion oftwo-year notes auctioned yesterday $10.38 billion of thesecurities went to New York, or about 78.7%. That's down from88.8% in August, 88.6% in July, 91.3% in June and 93.2% inMay.   Meanwhile, a larger than usual number of notes went tocustomers bidding through Federal Reserve banks in Atlanta,Richmond and Chicago.   Leonard Santow, a managing director at Griggs andamp; SantowInc., said the change may indicate that several commercialbanks that normally would bid through New York primarydealers, are bypassing Wall Street and bidding on their own.   &quot;Bids from districts outside of New York are usuallymodest, but this time they were quite consequential,&quot; saidMr. Santow. &quot;I think some of the large banks {outside of NewYork} are putting in bids through their own districts.&quot;   A spokesman for the Federal Reserve Bank in New York,which monitors the auction bidding on behalf of the TreasuryDepartment, said no one at the New York Fed had any idea whythe pattern of bidding may have changed.   Meanwhile, prices of long-term bonds declined while pricesof shorter-term securities, including the new two-year notes,appreciated. John Burrus, trading manager at CRT GovernmentSecurities Ltd., said the yield on the new two-year notesdrifted as low as 6.115% in when-issued trading.   The price of the bond market's bellwether security, the8.125% 30-year Treasury bond, declined about 1/8 pointyesterday, a loss of about $1.25 for a bond with a $1,000face amount. The issue's yield, which moves in the oppositedirection of its price, rose to 7.88% from 7.87% Monday.   At yesterday's two-year note auction, the New Yorkdistrict's share of the notes was down considerably from thefour previous two-year note auctions. But bidders from theRichmond district, where some big regional banks are based,were awarded $864 million, compared with $122 million inAugust, $53 million in July, $68 million in June and $60million in May.   Bidders from the Atlanta district were awarded $548million, compared with $37 million in August, $42 million inJuly, $52 million in June and $43 million in May.   Since Salomon Brothers disclosed that it used unauthorizedbids in the name of customers to buy more Treasury securitiesat auctions than regulations permit, the primary market forgovernment debt has come under increasing scrutiny.   As part of the increased market surveillance, the FederalReserve Bank of New York has been conducting spot checks ofcustomer bids submitted by the 39 primary dealers at Treasuryauctions. The New York Fed said that after it receives tenderforms submitted by dealers, it is calling some of thecustomers to see whether the bids are legitimate.   Analysts will be watching today's fiveyear note sale tosee if the pattern of a wider distribution of winning bidscontinues. In when-issued trading, the fiveyear note wasquoted late at 7.063%, down from 7.068% late Monday.                                                                                                          Treasury Securities                                                                                                          Treasurys ended narrowly mixed yesterday, with long-termbonds posting modest declines while short-term notes postedmodest gains.   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of102 20/32 to yield 7.88% compared with 102 25/32 to yield7.87% on Monday.   Here are details of yesterday's two-year note auction:                                                                                                          Rates are determined by the difference between thepurchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrowsthe investor's return while lower bidding widens it.

Municipal Bonds                                                                                                          Cities and states sold more than $2 billion of tax-exemptdebt, much of which was well received by investors.   Yesterday's heavy issuance ended a monthlong supplydrought and helped to sate the appetite of many institutions,including closed-end and open-end bond funds, that have seenlarge inflows of cash from individual investors.   Leading the new-issue slate were sizable offerings fromWashington, D.C., the Washington Public Power Supply Systemand the New York City Municipal Water Finance Authority. Thethree issues totaled nearly $1.5 billion.   The Washington, D.C., sale of $335.5 million of generalfund recovery unlimited tax general obligation bonds, soldvia competitive bidding, was greeted warmly by investors.   The offering was sold in two parts, with one consisting offixed-rate bonds and the other consisting of variable-ratesecurities. The $230 million variable-rate portion of thedeal was purchased by First Boston Corp. and priced with aninitial rate of 4.80%.   Letter-of-credit backing on the variable-rate bonds bythree Japanese banks helped attract investors to theoffering, which sold out, said a First Boston official.   The $105.5 million fixed-rate portion of the offering waspurchased by a Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. group and priced to yieldfrom 5.20% in 1992 to 5.65% in 1996. Late in the day, MariaDay-Marshall, the city's acting treasurer, said the offeringcould be increased to $110 million, bringing the size of theissue to $340 million.   The fixed-rate bonds due in 1992 are rated Baa by Moody'sInvestors Service Inc. and single-A-minus by Standard andamp;Poor's Corp. Bonds maturing in 1993-1996 are insured byFinancial Guaranty Insurance Co., a unit of General ElectricCo., and are rated triple-A by both Moody's and Sandamp;P. Lateyesterday, Bear Stearns reported an unsold balance of $35million on that portion of the offering.   Proceeds from the bond sale will be used to eliminate theDistrict of Columbia's $332 million accumulated deficit. Thesale also is expected to end the district's need for anannual short-term borrowing.   Washington Public Power Supply System sold $540 million ofrefunding revenue bonds in a negotiated offering. Strongdemand allowed underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. toend the order period earlier than scheduled on most of theoffering and reprice the issue to slightly lower yields.After repricing, the bonds were set to yield from 4.70% in1992 to 7.01% in 2017.   Also, a Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. group repriced$575 million of New York City Municipal Water FinanceAuthority bonds to yield from 5.10% in 1993 to 7.13% in 2012and 2015.   Most actively traded municipals finished unchanged to asmuch as 1/4 point higher. Among seasoned issues, the PalmBeach County, Fla., 6.60% bond due 2011 finished 1/4 higherat 99 1/4 to yield 6.66%.                                                                                                          Corporate andamp; Junk Bonds                                                                                                          Prices of investment-grade corporate bonds ended littlechanged, as did prices of high-risk, high-yield junk bonds.   Salomon Inc. bonds continued to weaken despite the WallStreet firm's attempts to soothe investors and corporateclients in the wake of the Treasury-auction scandal at itsSalomon Brothers unit.   Salomon confirmed that it expects to take a &quot;substantialcharge&quot; against third-quarter earnings, but the investmentbank noted that it has &quot;ample financial capacity&quot; to maintainits &quot;leadership&quot; in the securities trading and distributionbusinesses. The bond markets weren't convinced, however.   The company's bonds continued to slump amid fears that thecharge -- estimated by analysts to be between $200 millionand $300 million -- will be a fraction of the money needed tocover the fines and litigation costs relating to Salomon'sgovernment securities violations.   Salomon's 9% senior notes, due in 1995, finished at 921/4, down 3/4 point. The notes were yielding 11.60%, up from11.30% Monday and 10.90% Friday.   The weakness in the Salomon bonds is particularlystriking, especially when the issues are compared with debtsecurities from other brokerage houses.   For instance, Morgan Stanley Group Inc.'s 9.875% notes,due in 1995, were trading at about 106 1/2 and were yielding7.75%, while Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.'s 8.60% notes, due in 1995,were trading at 102 3/8 for a yield of 7.85%.                                                                                                          Mortgage andamp; Asset-Backed Securities                                                                                                          Prices of most actively traded mortgage securities ended5/32 to 6/32 lower.   In primary activity, four Federal National MortgageAssociation offerings totaling $2 billion were announced. Thecollateral for the three of the latest entries in the Remicmarket -- series 1991-141, 1991-147 and 1991-148 -- is FannieMae 9% securities. The agency's 15-year 8.5% securities backFannie Mae series 1991-146.   Despite a persistent flow of new Remics, which require thepurchases of mortgage securities for collateral, themortgage-backed market continues to lag behind Treasurys andyield spreads are getting wider.   Joseph Hu, senior vice president of mortgage-backedsecurities research at Nomura Securities International, looksfor the widening to go on for some time even though spreadshave already expanded considerably in recent weeks.   Mr. Hu cited several factors that had been keeping spreadsvery tight in the summer before the current widening move.There was low market volatility, the Treasury yield curve wasat historically steep levels, Remic issuance was heavy, andResolution Trust Corp. mortgage issuance hadn't yet gottenunder way.   Now, volatility has picked up considerably, the Treasurymarket has rallied in past weeks, and the RTC has becomeanother heavy issuer of mortgage-backed debt.   Mr. Hu noted that two of the factors remain in place. TheTreasury yield curve is still quite steep and Remic issuancehasn't slowed down. &quot;Once the curve flattens, mortgagespreads are going to widen even further,&quot; he said.   Remic issuance is attractive to underwriters when theTreasury yield curve is steep because most Remic classes arepriced relative to lower-yielding short-term Treasurys.</TEXT></DOC>
