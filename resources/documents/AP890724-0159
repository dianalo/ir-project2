ANDREWS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The National Endowment for the Arts would beforbidden to award tax-paid grants to sponsors of two controversialphotographic exhibitions for the next five years under legislationapproved Monday by a Senate Appropriations subcommittee.   The panel also endorsed a House-approved proposal to trim theendowment's proposed $171.4 million budget next year by $45,000 _the exact amount the agency gave for the two controversial shows byphotographers Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano.   In addition, the Senate subcommittee voted $100,000 to hire anoutside consultant to review the arts endowment's grant-makingprocedures, which have come under fire recently from severalconservative members of Congress.   The Senate panel's action drew a fast protest from HughSouthern, acting chairman of the endowment, an independent federalagency that currently awards $169 million annually to a widevariety of artists and arts institutions, from theaters andsymphony orchestras to painters and poets.   ``Enactment of this provision would be the first instance sincethe endowment's founding nearly 25 years ago of directcongressional involvement in awarding or prohibiting specificgrants,'' Southern said.   ``Banning funding for specific institutions establishes adangerous precedent which goes against the long and widelyrespected system of federal support for the arts through acompetitive peer review process,'' he said.   The bill would impose a five-year ban on NEA grants to theInstitute of Contemporary Art at the University of Pennsylvania,which organized the Mapplethorpe exhibition, and the SoutheasternCenter for Contemporary Art in Winston-Salem, N.C., which awardedNEA funds to Serrano.   The NEA had given $30,000 to underwrite a national tour of theMapplethorpe show, which included homoerotic and sadomasochisticpictures and several photos of nude children. The Corcoran Galleryof Art in Washington canceled plans to display the Mapplethorpephotos to avoid becoming involved in a political battle overcongressional financing of the endowment.   Serrano received a $15,000 NEA grant through the SoutheasternCenter for his work, which included a widely criticized photographof a Christ figure submerged in a container of the artist's urine.   The House, in its action on the arts endowment's budget on July12, did not propose banning grants to the two photographers'sponsors, but did include language intended to make the endowmentmore accountable for grant funds that are dispensed by a localinstitution.   The Rev. Donald E. Wildmon, a Methodist minister from Tupelo,Miss., urged Congress to eliminate all funds for the arts endowmentto halt what he called government subsidies for ``pornography andanti-Christian bigotry.''   Wildmon, executive director of the non-profit American FamilyAssociation, held a news conference Monday outside the endowment'sheadquarters here to protest the NEA's indirect support forMapplethorpe and Serrano.   Wildmon called their photographs ``extremely offensive,demeaning and pornographic.''</TEXT></DOC>
