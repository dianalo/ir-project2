Strict secrecy surrounded the first day of the two-day meetingunder the chairmanship of Chester Crocker, U.S. assistant secretaryof state for African affairs. The U.S. Embassy said Crocker wouldmake no statement until after the negotiations.   Officially, the talks at a small hotel in London's West End alsoencompassed independence for South African-controlled South-WestAfrica, or Namibia, which shares a border with Angola insouthwestern Africa.   But the region's two guerrilla groups were not invited, anddelegates to the talks were expected to concentrate on a formula topull back South African and Cuban forces from Angola.   The meeting follows an eight-year U.S. effort to get Cuba towithdraw 40,000 troops from Angola, sent in 1975 to defend theMarxist government against pro-Western rebels of UNITA, theNational Union for the Total Independence of Angola.   South African troops are in Angola backing rebels and alsoattacking bases of the South West African People's Organization,the guerrilla group fighting for independence and black majorityrule in Namibia.   The Angolans sent their foreign minister, Alfonso van Dunem, toTuesday's talks.   The negotiations marked the first publicly known meeting betweenthe South Africans and Cubans.   The Cubans dispatched a delegation headed by a senior member ofthe Cuban Communist Party, Jorge Risquet Valdes. Its five-memberdelegation also included military chief Gen. Ulises Rosales DelDoro, the Cuban Embassy said.   But the South African team was headed by a bureaucrat, Neil vanHeerden, director general of the Department of Foreign Affairs.   Meanwhile, Pretoria played down prospects of a breakthrough.   The state-controlled South African Broadcasting Corp. saidTuesday that ``by its nature, it (the London meeting) cannot bemuch more than exploratory.''   On Monday, South African President P.W. Botha had warned against``being too over-optimistic'' about the London talks.   ``The moment the Cubans leave that part of southern Africa andit is safe, then South Africa's forces will leave too,'' Botha toldParliament. He made no mention of Namibian independence.   The United States has backed the South African demand that Cubantroops leave Angola before South Africa gives independence toNamibia.   South Africa says it has about 3,000 troops in Angola, whileAngola maintains that 9,000 South Africans are backed by heavyartillery in its southern territory.</TEXT></DOC>
