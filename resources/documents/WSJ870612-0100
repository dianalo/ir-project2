Employment: 1,352,300   FOR YEARS, EXECUTIVES in the telecommunications industry have talked of a new &quot;Information Age&quot; made possible by advancing electronic and optical technologies. So much of that vision remains talk, however, that the industry gets only a C- for figuring out how to sell its impressive technological know-how.    &quot;It's not so much a matter of things not working technically,&quot; says Robert Hawk, vice president, marketing, of Mountain Bell, a unit of U S West Inc. &quot;We haven't been as good as the computer industry has been in putting new technologies in the marketplace and getting customers to accept them. We could have done a lot better.&quot;    American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., for instance, spent 10 years and $1 billion on a computer network called Net 1000 before realizing customers didn't want that technology. Much-ballyhooed technologies such as videoconferencing, voice messaging and videotex have been far slower to gain acceptance than their promoters originally believed.    Western Union Corp.'s poor financial shape results partly from overly optimistic estimates about the growth of electronic mail, a service the company developed to replace its low-tech telex business. Start-up companies offering private branch exchanges, or PBXs, that route voice and computer traffic through the same switch have found that many customers didn't want that technology either.    Part of the problem is the industry's long history of heavy regulation. Stretched-out depreciation schedules set by regulators seeking to hold down customer bills have kept some phone companies from buying new electronic switches and fiber-optic lines when the technology became available.    Only last year did GTE Corp. and United Telecommunications Inc. junk their existing long-distance networks and combine to build a new fiber-optic network. &quot;The partners were willing to write off the old analog radio systems&quot; at a cost of about $1.5 billion in order to gain a competitive edge selling fiber transmission, says Fred Lawrence, senior vice president, network development, of the venture US Sprint Communications Co.    Decades of regulation also left many telecommunications executives untrained in the art of marketing technological innovations to customers.    Thus, ignorance of a marketing axiom -- know the customer -- lurked behind the failure of fourth-generation PBXs that were designed to route both computer and phone traffic. Computers usually are bought by one department and phone lines and PBXs by another: Departmental rivalries within corporations keep either from handing off its traffic to the other.    As a result, most companies still have separate phone and computer networks even though it's technically feasible to put both kinds of traffic on the same lines. &quot;It's not a question of the technical ability&quot; of PBXs, says an ATandamp;T executive, Richard Snowden. &quot;It's how the things get sold.&quot;    Lack of coordination within the industry also has kept some technology locked up. ATandamp;T, for instance, developed PBXs that weren't quite compatible with its own long-distance network, in part because its PBX developers were kept by law from talking with long-distance officials until the restrictions were lifted in fall 1985.    Similarly, ATandamp;T blames the breakup of the Bell System for lack of certain services that use a separate signaling network within the nation's phone system. This network is used within ATandamp;T's long-distance lines to send the phone number separately from the call itself, enabling ATandamp;T to keep from sending calls to places where lines are busy.    ATandamp;T has used its signaling network to introduce &quot;800&quot; toll-free services, software-defined networks and credit-card checks. But services such as nationwide call tracing aren't available because the signaling network doesn't extend to local phone companies.    Technology has been used most extensively to reduce the costs of providing plain old telephone service. Electronic digital switches require less maintenance and operate far more efficiently than the old analog switches. Because of this, for example, Mountain Bell has been able to cut employment by 10,000 since divestiture, says Mr. Hawk.
