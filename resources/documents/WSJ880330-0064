Payments on the lease obligations amount to an estimated $47 million for the next eight years, the Boston transportation-equipment leaser said. Xtra said it would incur a &quot;modest pretax loss&quot; on the sale, which is expected to be completed by April 30. Chicago-based Itel Corp. is a transportation-services company.    The 4,100-unit rolling-stock fleet accounted for 4% of Xtra's $223 million revenue for its fiscal year ended September.    Xtra said it is negotiating with two separate parties, which weren't identified, for the acquisition of its European chassis fleet and its warehousing operations. If agreements are reached, the transactions would be expected to close by June 30, and would result in a slight pretax gain.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Xtra closed at $30.875 a share, up 62.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
