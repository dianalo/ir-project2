Of the 13 top-priority goals concerning pregnancy and infanthealth in the government's 1990 health objectives for the nation,only three are likely to be met, the CDC said Thursday.   ``It's certainly sobering and concerning,'' said Dr. Ann Koontz,a specialist with the Health Resources and Services Administrationin Rockville, Md. ``This indicates that we have some significantproblems relating to maternal and infant health.''   The CDC, using National Center for Health Statistics data,projects that the nation's infant mortality rate _ infants dyingbefore age 1 _ will be 9.1 per 1,000 live births.   That's a drop from the 10.6 rate in 1985, but still short of the9.0 rate in the 1990 objectives, which were published in 1979.   Based on earlier data from 1970-81, health officials hadprojected a 1990 infant mortality rate of 7.8, but ``the decline inthe infant mortality rate has slowed,'' the CDC said.   The reasons, Ms. Koontz said, are not known for certain: ``It'sa very complex field. We'd all like to see improvements, butthere's not been a simple solution.''   Another objective was that no racial or ethnic group should havean infant mortality rate worse than 12 per 1,000. Among blackAmericans, the rate stood at 18.2 in 1985 and is projected todecline only to 15.9 by 1990, the CDC said.   The infant mortality rate among whites stood at 9.3 per 1,000 in1985 and is projected to fall to 7.9 by 1990, the CDC said.   Economics may play a part in the discrepancy between themortality rates for blacks and whites. ``We know that poor economiccircumstances are distributed disproportionately among minoritypopulations,'' Ms. Koontz said.   But the complete reason is not clear, she said, noting thatprevious studies have shown that among college-educated mothers,black infants still have nearly twice the mortality rate ofcomparable white infants.   Among the other goals not likely to be met:   _No county, racial or ethnic group should have a maternal deathrate above five per 100,000 live births. The 1990 national rate isprojected at 7.0, with black mothers at 20.5.   _No more than 5 percent of babies should be born under 5.5pounds. The 1990 projection: 6.7 percent.   _No more than 10 percent of pregnant women in any county, racialor ethnic group should go without prenatal care in the first threemonths of pregnancy. The 1990 national projection: 23.6 percent,38.5 percent for blacks.   One of the goals that is likely to be met concerns the nation'sneonatal mortality rate _ babies dying in the first 28 days oflife. That rate is projected to be 5.7 per 1,000 in 1990, below thetarget of 6.5.   Two other goals are considered likely to be met: having mostbabies leave the hospital in car safety seats, and putting intoplace programs to screen newborns for metabolic disorders.   A 1987 survey found safety-seat use at hospitals of 75 percent,and all states now have such metabolic screening programs, the CDCsaid.</TEXT></DOC>
