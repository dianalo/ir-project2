Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., said Thursday followingthe 7-6 approval.   The measure would ban nine varieties of semiautomatic assaultweapons, five already covered by the Bush administration's importban and four others that are produced domestically.   The bill also would provide for up to 10 years of additionalprison time for those convicted of crimes involving firearms.   Critics called the measure too restrictive, although it wasmodest in comparison with a flurry of bills introduced in Februaryfollowing a mass slaying in a California schoolyard with asemiautomatic assault rifle.   ``I think it does a great deal of damage to the right of thepeople to keep and bear arms,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, told thecommittee. Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said the bill headedin the right direction but should be stronger in banning assaultweapons.   ``Frankly, it is a letdown to the law enforcement groups inAmerica,'' Metzenbaum said.</TEXT><NOTE>Congressmen Seek White House Meeting On Sea Turtle Decision</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Texas lawmakers are pressing for an emergencymeeting with President Bush to ask him to suspend regulationsrequiring shrimpers to equip their trawls with devices designed toprotect endangered sea turtles.   ``I'm as hot as a three-dollar pistol,'' Republican Rep. TomDeLay said Thursday after learning of the Commerce Department'sdecision to enforce the regulations on turtle excluder devices, orTEDs.   The Coast Guard last week had suspended enforcement of the TEDsregulations pending a review by Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher.   But on Thursday, the Coast Guard resumed enforcing thecontroversial law after Mosbacher and Coast Guard commander Adm.Paul A. Yost Jr. discussed the situation.   Brian Gorman, a spokesman for the Commerce Department, said the``regulations are the law and the secretary doesn't have muchflexibility in fiddling around with the law. He has to, under theEndangered Species Act, protect the endangered sea turtles.''   Gorman said the Commerce Department would continue to conductsurveys to determine whether a reported invasion of seaweed is aproblem in clogging the TEDs.   Rep. Solomon Ortiz, a Corpus Christi Democrat, claims seaweedand other debris clog the TEDs and reduce a shrimper's catch by 17percent to 35 percent.</TEXT><NOTE>Bunker Says His Business These Days is Hiring Lawyers, Fighting</NOTE><TEXT>   Lawsuits</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Nelson Bunker Hunt says even his brother'sRolex watch was probably held as collateral by banks owedsubstantial sums after the wealthy brothers' silver-buying bingeended with the silver price collapse of March 1980.
