 -- The Open Software Foundation (OSF) has set an ambitiouscourse with its second Request for Technology (RFT), announced late lastmonth.andM;OSF is seeking technologies to provide an Architecture-Neutral DistributionFormat (ANDF), or a single, hardware-independent format for distributingcomputing as an alternative to technologies that require a separate formatfor each hardware architecture.andM;In addition, OSF next month will issue a separate RFT that seeks &quot;distributedcomputing&quot; technologies to provide interoperability.andP;  However, simpleinteroperability is a far cry from ANDF.andM;&quot;Unlike current techniques that need to be ported to different hardwarearchitectures in binary form, ...andP;  This ANDF would let users make softwarebuying decisions independent of hardware platforms,&quot; said Liz Cobb, OSF'sbusiness area manager.andM;The ANDF solution would first convert source programs intomachine-independent ANDF for distribution, OSF officials said.andM;This first conversion would protect the proprietary source code and convertthe program to a standard representation, as well as setting up theapplication for further translation to the hardware-specific executables.andO;The ANDF program would then be translated into executable programs by amachine-dependent translator on each target system when the program isinstalled, the officials added.andM;OSF seeks to provide a C language-to-ANDF converter, one or moreANDF-to-executable translators, and specifications for the ANDF format andconversion/translation mechanisms.andP;  The initial hardware-dependenttranslators can be referenced and modified by those who license thetechnology to provide support for future hardware architectures, OSFofficials said.andM;Eventually, the ANDF will also support other programming languages, such asFortran and Cobol, they added.andM;&quot;For OSF, this is a really good opportunity to provide leadership in an areawith broad impact for open systems,&quot; Cobb said.andP;  &quot;We're catching this at anearly stage, when the technology is still evolving and relatively immature,yet at the same time it's ripe for defining an effective standard.&quot;andM;Some analysts doubted, however, that ANDF technology is &quot;mature&quot; enough torealize the OSF's goals, and if it is, whether it can be shipped by the 1990target date.andM;&quot;It looks like a difficult job to me,&quot; said Michael Howard, a vice presidentof Infonetics, a market research company in Santa Clara, Calif.andP;  &quot;The problemis that you have the Intel 386 architecture, the Motorola 68000 and then theRISC architectures, which are completely different, and these translators[for the executables] are not going to be a minimal job to create.&quot;andM;&quot;It's a good idea from OSF, but they're whistling in the dark,&quot; said GeorgeColo, president of Forrester Research, a market research company inCambridge, Mass.andM;&quot;I think they're overly optimistic about what they're trying to do,&quot; Colonysaid.andP;  &quot;I think that ABI [Application Binary Interface] is the best way toattack the problem--there's got to be some rules about the hardware.andM;&quot;I think that Sun is on the right track--instead of trying to translate thesoftware, standardize the hardware.andP;  The problem is that no one's going toaccept Sparc [as a standard], he added.andM;According to OSF officials, the ANDF and ABI technologies are not mutuallyexclusive.andP;  &quot;One model might be, after the code is distributed in ANDF, itwould be transformed into an ABI for execution,&quot; OSF's Cobb said.andM;&quot;We view that ANDF as being more flexible than ABI because it's not tied to aparticular hardware architecture,&quot; Cobb said.andP;  &quot;We don't see it as replacingABI--we see it as replacing it as a distribution format.&quot;andM;At least one analyst agreed with OSF officials about the advantages of ANDFand its potential compatibility with ABI.andM;&quot;ABI and ANDF aren't exclusive of each other--someone could generate a Sparctranslator, for instance,&quot; said Michael Goulde, a director at BIS CAPInternational, a market research company in Norwell, Mass.andM;&quot;Sun's been making a big brouhaha about shrink-wrap software, and this hasclear advantages over shrink-wrap,&quot; Goulde said.andP;  &quot;Even with a standard ABIarchitecture, you still get into a tremendous stocking problem for all thedifferent ABIs.andP;  [ANDF] goes beyond the shrink-wrap concept.&quot;andM;Goulde also said that given OSF's record with the first RFT, which resultedin the Motif user interface environment, the ANDF could well be successful.andO;&quot;It should be feasible and it should smoke out some interestingtechnologies,&quot; he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
