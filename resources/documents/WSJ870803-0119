What's mostly breaking down, it seems to us, is a pair of ancient legal doctrines. &quot;Mens rea&quot; stands for the requirement that someone have a bad motive before being charged with a crime. &quot;Actus reus&quot; means that there also must be an evil act.    These doctrines originally were developed to give specific meaning to crimes, so the law wouldn't be used for political prosecutions. In 1397, for example, Richard II made it treason to &quot;compass or imagine the death of the king.&quot; By the 1700s, Blackstone could write of &quot;mens rea&quot; that &quot;an unwarrantable act without a vicious will is no crime at all&quot; and of &quot;actus reus&quot; that &quot;as no temporal tribunal can search the heart, or fathom the intentions of the mind, otherwise than as they are demonstrated by outward actions, it therefore cannot punish for what it cannot know.&quot;    Now some acts always have been crimes even without intent, such as involuntary manslaughter. But since perhaps World War II, U.S. law has regressed. The statute books, and to a lesser extent the precedents, describe crimes that shortcut &quot;mens rea&quot; and &quot;actus reus.&quot; Most commonly, these statutes were intended to catch tax evaders, but were worded in language broad enough for prosecutors to find other uses. Some of these technical crimes no longer require evil intent, others no longer require a bad act and some require neither.    With the rise of these ill-defined crimes have come warnings that they again open avenues for selective prosecutions. In the 1959 Yale Law Journal, Yale law professor Abraham Goldstein urged Congress to repeal a statute called &quot;Conspiracy to Defraud the U.S.&quot; This law was passed in the late 1800s to enforce the tax code, but over time, it's been used by prosecutors who can't prove any traditional crime. Mr. Goldstein wrote that the fairness of the criminal law is undermined by mushy concepts such as conspiracy and fraud. &quot;Fraud,&quot; the only evil act necessary to such a crime, is an elastic concept. &quot;Defense counsel is placed in the unenviable position of not knowing what the defendant is supposed to have agreed to do,&quot; he wrote. This law is a &quot;Kafkaesque crime, unknown and unknowable except in terms of the facts of each case -- and even then, not until the verdict has been handed down.&quot;    At the end of its past term, the Supreme Court joined those expressing second thoughts about this class of crime. The justices invalidated a conviction under the mail-fraud statute. McNally v. U.S. concerned a former chairman of the Kentucky Democratic Party accused of insurance-premium kickbacks but indicted for mail fraud. The justices rejected the broad definition of &quot;fraud&quot; pushed by prosecutors, ruling that it &quot;does not refer to the intangible right of the citizenry to good government.&quot; The justices held that even people who have a fiduciary duty of honesty can be indicted for mail fraud only if they rob someone of precise property -- actual lost dollars and cents must be identified. Without this restriction, the crime of &quot;fraud&quot; would be too vague, too open to prosecutorial abuse.    As we see in the Ray Donovan case, juries also have an instinctive understanding of these tests. Mr. Donovan's firm was trying to meet minority-hiring goals, not steal money. No &quot;mens rea,&quot; no conviction.    The ancient tests also are useful in sorting out a variety of other public issues. Take insider trading. Ivan Boesky and Dennis Levine certainly displayed &quot;mens rea,&quot; and surely should have been convicted of something. But if alleged inside traders don't bribe people or run around with suitcases of cash, the crime of insider trading gets more difficult to define. This includes activities that shouldn't be crimes if done innocently, such as the gossip that greases the markets every day.    Consider the case against Mike Deaver. The special prosecutor apparently felt he couldn't prove that Mr. Deaver's lobbying violated the Ethics in Government Act, so he brought perjury charges instead. Mr. Deaver wasn't indicted for the crime he supposedly perjured himself about. But if there is no criminal charge, &quot;mens rea&quot; is doubtful for perjury.    The efforts to find crimes in the Iran-Contra hearings abound with efforts to shortcut &quot;mens rea&quot; and &quot;actus reus.&quot; Senator Inouye has found a statute, previously used mostly in tax cases, making it a crime to lie about anything. He has managed to drop oaths and other historical requirements of perjury. Speculations on what special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh is up to center on crimes almost identical to those Prof. Goldstein warned against. Whatever technical definitions may apply, the American people already have made clear they don't want Ollie North or John Poindexter charged with anything; they see no &quot;mens rea.&quot;    The common law represents centuries of wisdom on what an individual must have done to be convicted as a criminal. Modern prosecutors risk looking foolish and even tyrannical if they bend the laws to the breaking point to get indictments and convictions. The McNally case suggests the Supreme Court is about to move toward restoring the tests of &quot;mens rea&quot; and &quot;actus reus.&quot; We can see that there is also a practical reason for prosecutorial restraint. Jury members may not speak Latin, but if they don't see nefarious intentions or harmful acts, they aren't likely to convict. </TEXT></DOC>
