S. Naval Avionics Center in Indianapolis, hasled Indianapolis police investigators to an apparent electronic homosexualprostitution network that reached into 39 states, Canada, South Korea andGuam.andM;Dayton died suddenly while staying at the Zelzova Inn in Tiffin, Ohio and, inthe course of investigating the death, Seneca County sheriff's detective JimBrowning found material implicating Dayton in the running of the prostitutionring.andM;An unidentified man who was with Dayton at the time of his death stated toSeneca County investigators that he had had sex with Dayton at the inn andhad been discussing becoming a prostitute in the ring.andP;  Browning toldNewsbytes that &quot;It was a routine investigation of an untimely death that ledme to find computer print-outs and financial statements in Dayton's car.andO;This information coupled with the statement of the companion was enough toestablish the existence of a prostitution ring.andP;  As Dayton's home andemployment was in Indianapolis, we contacted the Indianapolis police and madethem aware of the evidence.&quot;andM;Browning added that Dayton's companion had made his statement voluntarily andhad not been charged with a crime because &quot;there was no indication that anymoney changed hands relating to sexual activity.&quot;andM;Marion County Deputy Prosecutor Michael Loomis told Newsbytes that there hadbeen an on-going investigation of Dayton before his death and &quot;that theinformation received from Browning provided sufficient to obtain a searchwarrant.andP;  In executing the search warrant, the Indianapolis police foundmaterial that substantiated the findings of the Seneca County Sheriff'sOffice.&quot;andM;The prosecutor says he is continuing the investigation into the prostitutionring using the material found in Dayton's apartment.andP;  Loomis did not commenton local newspaper reports that said that information found on at least 50prostitutes and 300 patrons implicated Indianapolis banking executives, aCincinnati priest and a Marion County police officer as members of the ring.andM;Although Loomis told Newsbytes that he believed that Indianapolis police hadinformed Naval Avionics security personnel of the on-going investigation ofDayton, Diana Hogue, director of public relations for the Naval AvionicsCenter, told Newsbytes that the Center had no knowledge of the investigationuntil after Dayton's death.andM;She also said that a wire service report which said there was no indicationthat Dayton had used government computers for the prostitution ring wasincorrect, &quot;What we said was that there was no connection between Mr.andO;Dayton's home personal computer and computers here at the Avionics Center.andO;We did find, in fact, that he had been using an old Honeywell system tomaintain lists of names apparently for this ring.andP;  The system was no longerin general use and only Mr. Dayton had access to it.&quot; She added that Daytonhad been employed by the Naval Avionics Center for six years and that hissupervisors have stated that he had always been a good employee.andM;The first public indication of the use of computers in the running of ahomosexual prostitution ring came on April 11, 1987 when Dayton, using thesign-on &quot;Blue Boy,&quot; left a message on the Indiana University - PurdueUniversity electronic bulletin board advertising employment for Muscles USA:&quot;Muscles USA is a nationwide service based in Indianapolis which provideswell-built guys to well-to-do-gentlemen.andP;  We are now hiring.&quot;andM;Don Smith, who runs the bulletin board, informed police of the message.andO;Smith, named in wire service reports as aiding the police in breakingDayton's computer codes, told Newsbytes that his only contact with the policeor involvement in the Dayton case had been the reporting of the bulletinboard message, &quot;If I had been responsible for breaking of the case, it wouldhave occurred three years ago.andP;  I was simply behaving properly as a bulletinboard system operator and I don't understand how the current stories gotstarted.andP;  There was no breaking of any coding structure then or since.&quot;andM;(Barbara E.
