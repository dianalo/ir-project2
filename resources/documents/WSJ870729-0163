PerryStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/29/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><DATELINE> WILMINGTON, Del.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Delaware, mother of presidential candidates.    Delaware?   Sure, little Delaware, the only state with 300 times as many chickens as people, a state without a commercial television station, an airport with scheduled passenger flights, a big-league sports team, a medical school, or a symphony orchestra.    Little Delaware -- &quot;Small Wonder,&quot; according to its own travel brochures -- is the home of Democratic Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Republican Pierre S. du Pont IV, serious, if not front-running, presidential candidates.    Having two Delawareans running for president is probably the biggest thing to happen to the state since its greatest hero, Caesar Rodney, jumped on his horse (or did he leap into a carriage?) to speed off into a dark and rainy night in 1776 to cast a critical vote for American independence in Philadelphia.    &quot;We love it,&quot; says Sidney Balick, a local lawyer and one-time associate of Mr. Biden.    &quot;It's nice,&quot; says Charles Richards, another local lawyer and one-time associate of Mr. du Pont. &quot;With two presidential candidates, the state gets a little recognition.&quot;    It isn't all that unusual for a small state to produce a serious presidential contender -- or, for that matter, even a president. New Hampshire gave the nation Franklin Pierce; Maine, James G. Blaine. William Jennings Bryan came from Nebraska, George McGovern from South Dakota. And Jimmy Carter's Georgia isn't exactly California.    But Delaware is a curious little place, perhaps an appropriate breeding ground for modern presidential candidates. There isn't a whole lot of there here. Sixty percent of the population started life somewhere else, including Sen. Biden, who was born in Scranton, Pa. Most Delawareans -- about 400,000 out of 600,000 -- live in New Castle County. Of that number, 70,000, more than half of them black or Hispanic, live in Wilmington. The rest, almost all of them white, live in the sprawling suburbs.    It is more and more a service-based, white-collar economy. &quot;Perhaps,&quot; says John Munroe, author of a general history of the state, &quot;the clerk and the repairman will inherit the future.&quot;    People living in Delaware seem to like their state. It is small and manageable, and a lot cheaper than surrounding states. People who take the time like the state's politics, too, for it tends to be intimate. &quot;Delaware elections,&quot; says Vincent D'Anna, who has worked for Sen. Biden for 15 years, &quot;are hand-to-hand combat.&quot;    It is, in fact, a universally held notion in Delaware that both Sen. Biden and former Gov. du Pont will do well in the caucuses in Iowa and the primaries in New Hampshire because they are veterans of Delaware's door-to-door politics.    There is no doubt Delaware stands to benefit from the recognition it will receive by showcasing a brace of presidential candidates. It's had a long slog on the road to winning respect. In Colonial days, it didn't even have a name -- being called, usually, &quot;the lower counties.&quot; The &quot;upper counties&quot; were called Pennsylvania.    Things were so bad that the royal governors never got any instructions for what was to become Delaware (named for Lord de la Warr, the governor of highly respected Virginia), and back in London they didn't even keep a file for the colony.    In more recent years, Delaware has been written off as a colony of the giant Du Pont Co., founded by presidential candidate du Pont's great-great-great grandfather, Eleuthere Irenee du Pont, in 1802. (The company is spelled most of the time with a capital D; most members of the family spell their name with a lower-case d.)    &quot;The company&quot; -- that's how it is known even today in the state -- isn't the factor in Delaware's social, political and business life that it used to be, but it is still the No. 1 employer, with 23,500 employees, 6% of the work force. The state also has two giant auto-assembly plants, one operated by General Motors Corp., with 5,200 workers, and the other by Chrysler Corp., with 4,500. And Wilmington's skyline is now dotted with high-rise buildings put up by banks from all over the country that have settled here to take advantage of the state's lenient corporate and banking regulations. (When Mr. du Pont was governor, for a striking example, the state eliminated its usury laws.)    It is testament to Delaware's failure to win much respect that no one has ever written a political history of the state. And yet, there have been moments. For instance, Thomas &quot;Old Tom&quot; Bayard was a close second on the first ballot at the 1880 Democratic convention in Cincinnati, only to lose the presidential nomination to Winfield Scott Hancock.    Sen. Bayard, by all accounts, was a distinguished politician. But for much of Delaware's history, its politics has been corrupt.    Surely a book could be written about John Edward Charles O'Sullivan Addicks, known to his friends as &quot;Gas&quot; Addicks and to the journalists of his day as &quot;the Napoleon of Gas.&quot; He made a fortune in big-city gas monopolies before moving to Claymont, in Delaware, in 1877. For months, he thought he was living in Delaware County, Pa., which shows that even back then Delaware had an identity problem.    When Mr. Addicks discovered he was actually living in the state of Delaware, it occurred to him he could win a seat in the U.S. Senate by buying votes to elect friends to the state Legislature, which in those days selected senators. The going rate was about $50 a vote, and Mr. Addicks kept buying votes for the next 20 years.    His control was such that he was sometimes the state's only senator. By 1894, he could boast: &quot;I've bought it. I've paid for it. And I'm going to have it.&quot; But he was frustrated by a rare, early du Pont politician, Gen. Henry A. du Pont, who made it to the Senate himself and stayed there by buying votes the &quot;Gas&quot; Addicks way.    The most successful of all the du Pont politicians -- so far, at least -- was T. Coleman du Pont, who was nominated for president at two conventions. T. Coleman was obsessed with big highways, and he showed how to get things done the du Pont way. Unable to coerce the Legislature into building a 110-mile highway, he formed a private company in 1911 and built it himself for $4 million. It is called -- one guess -- the DuPont Highway.    Then there was Alfred I. du Pont, who spent the early part of his career running the family gunpowder business. Later he began worrying about poor people. In 1929, after the Legislature refused to adopt old-age pensions for needy Delawareans, he set up his own pension system and began mailing out checks.    How times have changed. The current du Pont calls himself &quot;Pete&quot; and, as far as anyone knows, he has yet to spend a dime of his own money to become Delaware's first president. </TEXT></DOC>
