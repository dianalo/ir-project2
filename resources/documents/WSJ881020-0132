The environmentalists, led by the Natural Resources Defense Council, said they will file suit to block the restarting of the three reactors in Aiken, S.C., unless the department completes a formal environmental impact statement. The restarting of the reactors, which are the only U.S. facilities producing tritium for use in nuclear weapons, is scheduled to begin in phases at the end of December.    The document, which could take as long as a year to complete, would require the department to examine alternative means of producing tritium. The council has won four similar suits in the past. In a suit last year, it compelled the Energy Department to file an impact statement, and the agency subsequently dropped plans to restart a nuclear weapons reactor in Hanford, Wash.    &quot;This is not a paper exercise,&quot; said the council's Dan Reicher. &quot;These documents, if they are done honestly and rigorously, do influence agency decisions.&quot;    An Energy Department spokesman said the agency doesn't plan to prepare the impact statement, because it believes the reactor restarts don't meet the legal standard of being &quot;a major federal action.&quot; In previous cases when courts ordered the document, the weapons reactors were closed for years, instead of just months. A 34-year-old reactor, designated as the L reactor and scheduled to return to operation first, has been shut down since June because of safety concerns.    The difficulty of balancing the safe operation of decades-old reactors against the need for nuclear weapons material has prompted scrutiny of the Energy Department. In recent weeks, department officials admitted that they allowed contractors to manage the plants over the years in ways that emphasized weapons production over safety, but that extensive safety reviews are under way.    None of the three Savannah River reactors have been operating since August due to separate safety concerns. Department officials and the council said sufficient tritium exists for months or years. Tritium, which increases the blast of nuclear bombs, loses its effectiveness after seven years and must be periodically replaced on 22,000 U.S. warheads that require it.    The council also charged that the Energy Department misstated the facts in a 1984 environmental impact statement for the L reactor. Among the alleged misstatements were assertions that &quot;no significant reactor accidents have occurred at the Savannah River Plant in its 30 years of operation.&quot; But a recently released 1985 Energy Department memo listed 31 accidents of &quot;most significance.&quot;    Troubled by those disclosures, a bipartisan group of members of Congress wrote to President Reagan yesterday, urging that the Energy Department &quot;re-establish management control and authority over the operating contractors at its facilities,&quot; and delay restarting the Savannah River reactors until an outside committee reviews the department's plans.    &quot;The Department of Energy should not be a fire department,&quot; said Rep. Mike Synar (D., Okla.). &quot;Yet it is reacting to crises rather than preventing them.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
