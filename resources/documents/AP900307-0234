BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Greyhound says it is ``slowly but surely''restoring service at the strikebound bus company with replacementdrivers and breakaway union members.   Greyhound Lines Inc., America's only nationwide bus system, saidtoday its ridership Tuesday was 37.1 percent of the number carreidon the same day last year, an increase from Monday's 33.8 percentand Friday's 30 percent.   ``The trend is up. There is no erosion in our service,'' saidGeorge Gravley, a spokesman for GLI Holdings, parent company ofGreyhound. ``It's getting better slowly but surely.''   The company's 6,300 drivers and about 3,000 office andmaintenance workers are on strike. The union has asked for newtalks, but none are scheduled, although the chief negotiators spokebriefly by telephone Tuesday.   The union issued a bulletin to its members Tuesday, urging themto use their cars to take blood to hospitals where supplies mayhave been disrupted by the strike.   But Red Cross officials said they were unaware of any seriousdisruptions, although blood usually delivered by bus was beingcarried by alternate transportation in some cases.   The company has been operating with about 700 replacementdrivers plus what it says are 350 union members who crossed picketlines. Union officials said their own checks show that only 95union drivers have been behind the wheel.   Gravley said the replacement drivers are being paid under thecontract terms the strikers rejected.   The contract does not change base pay but allows drivers toreach higher pay levels sooner by setting up a system based onexperience rather than seniority, Gravley said. It also rewardsaccident-free driving, he said.   The union has rejected pay increases linked to productivity.Greyhound drivers made an average of $24,743 last year, accordingto the company.</TEXT></DOC>
